conditions of this Agreement.

 

B. Following the consummation of the Offer, Purchaser will be merged with and

AGREEMENT

follows:

 

SECTION 1\. THE OFFER

1.1 The Offer.

(a) Commencement of the Offer. Provided that this Agreement shall not have

(b) Terms and Conditions of the Offer. The obligations of Purchaser to, and
of Parent to cause Purchaser to, accept for payment, and pay for, any Shares

pursuant to the Offer are subject to the terms and conditions of this
Agreement, including the prior satisfaction of the Minimum Condition and the
satisfaction or waiver of the other conditions set forth in Annex I

set forth in this Agreement, the Minimum Condition and the other Offer
Conditions. Purchaser expressly reserves the right, in whole or in part, to
(i) increase the Offer Price, (ii) waive any Offer Condition and (iii) make

other than as required or permitted by this Agreement, or (H) provide any
"subsequent offering period" within the meaning of Rule 14d-11 promulgated

is terminated in accordance with Section 8.

 

(c) Expiration and Extension of the Offer. The Offer shall initially be
scheduled to expire at 12:01 a.m., Eastern Time, on the twenty-first (21st)
business day following the Offer Commencement Date, determined as set forth in

Date,_ " such date or such subsequent date and time to which the expiration of
the Offer is extended in accordance with the terms of this Agreement, the

may, in its discretion (and without the consent of the Company or any other
Person), extend the Offer on one or more occasions, for an additional period
of up to ten (10) business days per extension, to permit such Offer Condition
to be satisfied; (ii) Purchaser shall extend the Offer from time to time for:
(A) any period required by any Legal Requirement, any interpretation or
position of the SEC, the staff thereof or NASDAQ applicable to the Offer; and
(B) periods of up to ten (10) business days per extension, until any waiting
period (and any extension thereof) applicable to the consummation of the
Offer under the HSR Act shall have expired or been terminated; and (iii) if,
as of the scheduled Expiration Date, any Offer Condition is not satisfied and
has not been waived, at the request of the Company, Purchaser shall extend
the Offer on one or more occasions for an additional period of up to ten (10)

(2) be permitted to extend the Offer beyond the Extension Deadline without the
prior written consent of the Company; or (3) be required by the Company to
extend the Offer by more than two (2) incremental ten (10) business day
periods in the event that each Offer Condition (other than the Minimum
Condition) shall have been satisfied or waived as of any then scheduled
expiration of the Offer and the Minimum Condition shall not have been
satisfied as of such scheduled expiration of the Offer. Purchaser shall not
terminate the Offer prior to any scheduled Expiration Date without the prior
written consent of the Company except in the event that this Agreement
is terminated pursuant to Section 8. __

(d) Termination of Offer. In the event that this Agreement is terminated
pursuant to Section 8.1, Purchaser shall (and Parent shall cause Purchaser

respects with the Exchange Act and other applicable Legal Requirements. Each
of Parent, Purchaser and the Company agrees to promptly correct any
information provided by it for use in the Offer Documents if and to the
extent that such information shall have become false or misleading in any
material respect, and Parent further agrees to take all steps necessary to

under this Agreement. Parent and Purchaser shall, and each of Parent and
Purchaser shall ensure that all of their respective controlled Affiliates
shall, tender any Shares held by them into the Offer.

 

(g) Adjustments. If, between the date of this Agreement and the Offer
Acceptance Time, the outstanding Shares are changed into a different number
or class of shares by reason of any stock split, division or subdivision of
shares, stock dividend, reverse stock split, consolidation of shares,
reclassification, recapitalization or other similar transaction, then the
Offer Price shall be appropriately adjusted.

1.2 Company Actions.

(i) any Shares then held by the Company in the Companys treasury shall be
canceled and retired and shall cease to exist, and no consideration shall be
delivered in exchange therefor;

(ii) any Shares then held by Purchaser that were accepted for payment by
Purchaser in the Offer shall be canceled and retired and shall cease to exist,
and no consideration shall be delivered in exchange therefor;

 



6\. __(iii) __except as provided in clauses "(i)" and "(ii)" above and subject to
Section 2.5(b), each Share then outstanding (other than any Dissenting
Shares, as defined below) shall be converted into the right to receive the

subject to any withholding of Taxes required by applicable Legal Requirements
in accordance with Section 2.6(e); and __

 

(iv) each share of the common stock, $0.01 par value per share, of Purchaser
then outstanding shall be converted into one share of common stock of the

(b) If, between the date of this Agreement and the Effective Time, the
outstanding Shares are changed into a different number or class of shares by
reason of any stock split, division or subdivision of shares, stock dividend,
reverse stock split, consolidation of shares, reclassification,
recapitalization or other similar transaction, then the Merger Consideration
shall be appropriately adjusted.

2.6 Surrender of Certificates; Stock Transfer Books.

__(a) __Prior to the Offer Acceptance Time, Parent shall designate a bank or
trust company reasonably acceptable to the Company to act as agent (the "
_Depository Agent_ ") for the holders of shares of Company Common Stock to
receive the funds to which holders of such shares shall become entitled
pursuant to Section 1.1(b) and to act as agent (the " _Paying Agent_ ") for
the holders of shares of Company Common Stock to receive the funds to which
holders of such shares shall become entitled pursuant to Section 2.5. At
or prior to the Offer Acceptance Time, Parent shall deposit, or shall cause
to be deposited, with the Depository Agent cash sufficient to make payment of
the cash consideration payable pursuant to Section 1.1(b) and with the Payment
Agent cash sufficient to make payment of the cash consideration payable
pursuant to Section 2.5 (together, the " _Payment Fund_ "). The Payment Fund
shall not be used for any other purpose. The Payment Fund shall be invested by
the Paying Agent as directed by the Surviving Corporation; ___provided_ __,
that such investments shall be in obligations of or guaranteed by the United
States of America in commercial paper obligations rated A-1 or P-1 or better
by Moody s Investors Service, Inc. or Standard and Poors Corporation,
respectively, in certificates of deposit, bank repurchase agreements or
bankers acceptances of commercial banks with capital exceeding $1
billion, or in money market funds having a rating in the highest investment
category granted by a recognized credit rating agency at the time of
acquisition or a combination of the foregoing and, in any such case, no such
instrument shall have a maturity exceeding three (3) months. __

__(b) __Promptly after the Effective Time (but in no event later than five
(5) business days thereafter), the Surviving Corporation shall cause to be
mailed to each Person who was, at the Effective Time, a holder of record of
the shares of Company Common Stock entitled to receive the Merger
Consideration pursuant to Section 2.5 (including in connection with an
exercise or deemed exercise of a Company Warrant pursuant to Section 2.8) a
form of letter of transmittal (which shall be in reasonable and customary form
and shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title
to the certificates evidencing such shares (the " _Certificates_ ") shall
pass, only upon proper delivery of the Certificates (or effective affidavits
of loss in lieu thereof) to the Paying Agent) and instructions for use in
effecting the surrender of the __

 



7\.  Certificates or Book-Entry Shares pursuant to such letter of transmittal.
Upon surrender to the Paying Agent of Certificates (or effective affidavits of
loss in lieu thereof) or Book-Entry Shares, together with such letter of
transmittal, duly completed and validly executed in accordance with the
instructions thereto, and such other documents as may be required pursuant to
such instructions, the holder of such Certificates or Book-Entry Shares shall
be entitled to receive in exchange therefor the Merger Consideration for each
share of Company Common Stock formerly evidenced by such Certificates or Book-
Entry Shares, and such Certificates and Book-Entry Shares shall then be
canceled. No interest shall accrue or be paid on the Merger Consideration
payable upon the surrender of any Certificates or Book-Entry Shares for the
benefit of the holder thereof. If the payment of any Merger Consideration is
to be made to a Person other than the Person in whose name the surrendered
Certificates formerly evidencing the shares of Company Common Stock is
registered on the stock transfer books of the Company, it shall be a condition
of payment that the Certificate so surrendered shall be endorsed properly or
otherwise be in proper form for transfer and that the Person requesting such
payment shall have paid all transfer and other similar Taxes required by
reason of the payment of the Merger Consideration to a Person other than the
registered holder of the Certificate surrendered, or shall have established to
the satisfaction of the Surviving Corporation that such Taxes either have been
paid or are not applicable. Payment of the applicable Merger Consideration
with respect to Book-Entry Shares shall only be made to the Person in whose
name such Book-Entry Shares are registered.

 

(c) At any time following twelve (12) months after the Effective Time, the
Surviving Corporation shall be entitled to require the Paying Agent to
deliver to it any funds which had been made available to the Paying Agent and
not disbursed to holders of Certificates or Book-Entry Shares (including all
interest and other income received by the Paying Agent in respect of all
funds made available to it), and, thereafter, such holders shall be entitled
to look to the Surviving Corporation (subject to abandoned property, escheat
and other similar Legal Requirements) only as general creditors thereof with
respect to the Merger Consideration that may be payable upon due surrender of
the Certificates or Book-Entry Shares held by them. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, neither the Surviving Corporation nor the Paying Agent shall be
liable to any holder of Certificates or Book-Entry Shares for the Merger
Consideration delivered in respect of such share to a public official pursuant
to any abandoned property, escheat or other similar Legal Requirements. Any
amounts remaining unclaimed by such holders at such time at which such
amounts would otherwise escheat to or become property of any Governmental Body
shall become, to the extent permitted by applicable Legal Requirements, the
property of the Surviving Corporation or its designee, free and clear of all
claims or interest of any Person previously entitled thereto.

(d) At the close of business on the day of the Effective Time, the
stock transfer books of the Company with respect to the shares of Company
Common Stock shall be closed and thereafter there shall be no further
registration of transfers of shares of Company Common Stock on the records of
the Company. From and after the Effective Time, the holders of the shares of
Company Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall
cease to have any rights with respect to such shares except as otherwise
provided herein or by applicable Legal Requirements. 

 



8\. (e) Each of the Surviving Corporation, Parent and Purchaser shall be entitled
to deduct and withhold (or cause the Paying Agent to deduct and withhold)
from the Merger Consideration payable to any holder of the Shares or any other
consideration otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement such amounts as it
is required by any Legal Requirement to deduct and withhold with respect to
Taxes. Each such payor shall take all action that may be necessary to ensure
that any such amounts so withheld are promptly and properly remitted to the
appropriate Governmental Body. To the extent that amounts are so withheld,
such withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as
having been paid to the holder of the shares of Company Common Stock or other
recipient of consideration hereunder in respect of which such deduction and
withholding was made.

(f) If any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the
making of an affidavit of that fact by the Person claiming such Certificate
to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if required by the Surviving Corporation,
the posting by such Person of a bond, in such reasonable amount as Parent may
direct, as indemnity against any claim that may be made against it with
respect to such Certificate (which shall not exceed the Merger Consideration
payable with respect to such Certificate), the Paying Agent will pay (less any
amounts entitled to be deducted or withheld pursuant to Section 2.6(e)), in
exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate, the applicable Merger
Consideration to be paid in respect of the shares of Company Common Stock
formerly represented by such Certificate, as contemplated by this Section 2.

2.7 Dissenters Rights. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the
contrary, shares of Company Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time, and held by holders who are entitled to appraisal rights under
Section 262 of the DGCL and have properly exercised and perfected their
respective demands for appraisal of such shares in the time and manner
provided in Section 262 of the DGCL and, as of the Effective Time, have
neither effectively withdrawn nor lost their rights to such appraisal and
payment under the DGCL (the " _Dissenting Shares_ "), shall not be converted
into the right to receive Merger Consideration, but shall, by virtue of the
Merger, be entitled to only such consideration as shall be determined pursuant
to Section 262 of the DGCL; _provided, that_ if any such holder shall have
failed to perfect or shall have effectively withdrawn or lost such holders
right to appraisal and payment under the DGCL, such holders shares of Company
Common Stock shall be deemed to have been converted as of the Effective Time
into the right to receive the Merger Consideration (less any amounts entitled
to be deducted or withheld pursuant to Section 2.6(e)), and such shares shall
not be deemed to be Dissenting Shares. The Company shall give Parent prompt
notice of any demands received by the Company for appraisal of Shares, and
Parent shall have the right to participate in and, after the Offer Acceptance
Time, direct all negotiations and proceedings with respect to such demands.
The Company shall not, without the prior written consent of Parent, make any
payment with respect to, or settle or offer to settle, any such demands. The
Company shall provide each of the holders of Company Common Stock as of the
record date for the purpose of receiving the notice required by Section
262(d) of the DGCL with the notice contemplated thereby as part of the
Schedule 14D-9.

 



9\. 2.8 Treatment of Company Options, Company RSUs; Restricted Stock and Warrants.

 

(a) Each Company Option that is outstanding as of immediately prior to the
Effective Time shall accelerate and become fully vested and exercisable
effective immediately prior to, and contingent upon, the Effective Time. As of
the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any further action on
the part of the holders thereof, the Parent, Purchaser or the Company,
each Company Option that is then outstanding and unexercised shall be
cancelled and converted into the right to receive cash (without interest) in
an amount equal to the product of (i) the total number of shares of Company
Common Stock subject to such fully vested Company Option immediately prior to
the Effective Time, multiplied by (ii) the excess, if any, of (x) the Merger
Consideration over (y) the exercise price payable per Share under such Company
Option, which amount shall be paid in accordance with Section 2.8(d). No
holder of a Company Option that has an exercise price per Share that is equal
to or greater than the Merger Consideration shall be entitled to any payment
with respect to such cancelled Company Option before or after the Effective
Time.

(b) Each Company RSU that is outstanding as of immediately prior to
the Effective Time shall accelerate and become fully vested effective
immediately prior to, and contingent upon, the Effective Time. In lieu of any
issuance of shares of Company Common Stock in settlement of such vested
Company RSU, as of the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without
any further action on the part of the holders thereof, the Parent, Purchaser
or the Company, each Company RSU that is outstanding shall be cancelled and
converted into the right to receive cash (without interest) in an amount
equal to the product of (i) the total number of shares of Company Common Stock
issuable in settlement of such fully vested Company RSU immediately prior to
the Effective Time, multiplied by (ii) the Merger Consideration, which amount
shall be paid in accordance with Section 2.8(d).

(c) Each Company Restricted Stock Award that is outstanding as of immediately
prior to the Offer Acceptance Time shall accelerate and become fully vested
such that the Companys right of reacquisition or repurchase, as applicable,
shall lapse in full effective immediately prior to, and contingent upon, the
Offer Acceptance Time. As of the Offer Acceptance Time, by virtue of the Offer
Acceptance Time and without any further action on the part of the holders
thereof, the Parent, Purchaser or the Company, each share of Company
Common Stock underlying each Company Restricted Stock Award that is
outstanding shall be treated as an outstanding Share for purposes of this
Agreement, including for purposes of tendering pursuant to the Offer.

 

(d) As soon as reasonably practicable after the Effective Time (but no later
than the earlier of (x) 15 days after the Effective Time or (y) the second
payroll date after the Effective Time), the Surviving Corporation shall pay
the aggregate Merger Consideration, net of any applicable withholding Taxes,
payable with respect to Company Options and Company RSUs through, to the
extent applicable, the Surviving Corporations payroll (subject to any
required tax withholdings) to the holders of Company Options and Company RSUs;
_provided, however,_ that to the extent the holder of a Company Option or a
Company RSU is not, and was not at any time during the vesting period of the
Company Option or Company RSU, as

 



10\.  applicable, a Company employee, the consideration payable pursuant to
Section 2.8(a) with respect to such Company Options or Company RSUs shall be
paid in the manner described in Section 2.6.

(e) Prior to the Closing, the Company shall satisfy all notification
requirements under the terms of any Company Warrants and each Company Warrant
that is listed on Schedule 2.8(e)(i) and that is issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the Offer Acceptance Time, unless otherwise elected by
the holder of any such Company Warrant, shall be deemed exercised immediately
prior to the Offer Acceptance Time pursuant to Section 2(b) of such Company
Warrant. All Shares issued to holders of Company Warrants pursuant to an
exercise or deemed exercise shall be made through Book-Entry Shares.

 

2.9 Loan Payoff. Prior to the Closing, the Company shall satisfy all
notification and consent requirements, as applicable, under the terms of the
Oxford Loan and Security Agreement. The Company shall obtain prior to the
Closing a payoff letter (the " _Payoff Letter_ ") for the Oxford Loan and
Security Agreement, which shall (i) provide the dollar amount of all
Indebtedness required to be paid under the Oxford Loan and Security Agreement
in order to fully pay off such Indebtedness as of the Closing (the " _Payoff
Amount_ ") and (ii) indicate that the Acquired Corporations shall be
discharged from any and all obligations pursuant to such Indebtedness (and any
documentation in connection therewith shall terminate) and that all
Encumbrances securing the Indebtedness shall automatically be deemed released
from and after the Closing Date upon payment of the Payoff Amount. Parent
and/or Purchaser shall pay the Payoff Amount in full on the Closing Date.

 

2.10 Further Action. If, at any time after the Effective Time, any further
action is reasonably determined by Parent to be necessary or desirable to
carry out the purposes of this Agreement or to vest the Surviving Corporation
with full right, title and possession of and to all rights and property of
Purchaser and the Company, the officers and directors of the
Surviving Corporation and Parent shall be fully authorized (in the name of
Purchaser, in the name of the Company and otherwise) to take such action.

timely basis all reports, schedules, forms, statements and other documents
(including exhibits and all other information incorporated therein) required
to be filed or furnished by the Company with the SEC (the " _Company SEC
Documents_ "). As of their respective dates, the Company SEC Documents
complied in all material respects with the requirements of the Securities Act,
the Exchange Act or the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, as the case may be, and the rules
and regulations of the SEC promulgated thereunder applicable to such Company
SEC Documents and, except to the extent that information contained in such
Company SEC Document has been revised, amended, modified or superseded (prior
to the date of this Agreement) by a later filed Company SEC Document, none of
the Company SEC Documents when filed or furnished contained any untrue
statement of a material fact or omitted to state a material fact required to
be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein,
in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading. __

__(b) __The consolidated financial statements (including any related notes
and schedules) contained or incorporated by reference in the Company SEC
Documents: (i) complied as to form in all material respects with the
published rules and regulations of the SEC applicable thereto; (ii) were

principles (" _GAAP_ ") applied on a consistent basis throughout the periods

statements, as permitted by Form 10-Q, Form 8-K or any successor form under
the Exchange Act); and (iii) fairly present, in all material respects, the
financial position of the Company and its consolidated Subsidiaries as of the
respective dates thereof and the results of operations and cash flows of the
Company and its consolidated Subsidiaries for the periods covered thereby
(subject, in the case of the unaudited financial statements, to normal and
recurring year-end adjustments that are not, individually or in the aggregate,
material). No financial statements of any Person other than the Company are
required by GAAP to be included in the consolidated financial statements of
the Company. __

(c) The Company maintains, and at all times since February 5, 2014 has
maintained, a system of internal controls over financial reporting (as defined
in Rules 13a-15(f)

 



14\.  and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) which is designed to provide
reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the
preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with
GAAP, and includes those policies and procedures that: (i) pertain to the
maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect
the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the Company; (ii) provide
reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit
preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP and that receipts
and expenditures are being made only in accordance with authorizations
of management and directors of the Company; and (iii) provide reasonable
assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized
acquisition, use or disposition of the assets of the Company that could have a
material effect on the financial statements. The Companys management has
completed an assessment of the effectiveness of the Companys system of
internal controls over financial reporting in compliance with the requirements
of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act for the fiscal year ended December
31, 2014, and such assessment concluded that such controls were effective. To
the knowledge of the Company, except as set forth in the Company SEC Documents
filed prior to the date of this Agreement, since January 1, 2014, neither the
Company nor the Companys independent registered accountant has identified or
been made aware of: (1) any significant deficiency or material weakness in the
design or operation of internal control over financial reporting utilized by
the Company; (2) any illegal act or fraud, whether or not material, that
involves the management or other employees of the Company; or (3) any claim or
allegation regarding any of the foregoing. 

(d) The Company maintains disclosure controls and procedures required by Rule
13a-15 or 15d-15 under the Exchange Act that are designed to ensure that all
information required to be disclosed in the Companys reports that it files or
submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported
within the time periods specified in the rules and forms of the SEC and that
all such information is accumulated and communicated to the Companys
management as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required
disclosure and to enable each of the principal executive officer of the
Company and the principal financial officer of the Company to make the
certifications required under the Exchange Act with respect to such reports.

 

(e) The Company is not a party to nor has any obligation or other commitment
to become a party to any securitization transaction, off-balance sheet
partnership or any similar Contract (including any Contract relating to any
transaction or relationship between or among the Company, on the one hand, and
any unconsolidated Affiliate, including any structured finance,
special purpose or limited purpose Entity, on the other hand, or any "off-
balance sheet arrangements" (as defined in Item 303(a) of Regulation S-K under
the Exchange Act)) where the result, purpose or intended effect of such
Contract is to avoid disclosure of any material transaction involving, or
material liabilities of, the Company in the Companys published financial
statements or other Company SEC Documents.

 

(f) As of the date of this Agreement, there are no outstanding or unresolved
comments in comment letters received from the SEC with respect to the Company
SEC Documents. To the knowledge of the Company, none of the Company SEC
Documents is the subject of ongoing SEC review and there are no inquiries or
investigations by the SEC or any internal investigations pending
or threatened, in each case regarding any accounting practices of the
Company.

 



15\. __(g) __Each document required to be filed by the Company with the SEC in
connection with the Offer (the " _Company Disclosure Documents_ ") (including
the Schedule 14D-9), and any amendments or supplements thereto, when filed,
distributed or disseminated, as applicable, will comply as to form in all
material respects with the applicable requirements of the Exchange Act. The
Company Disclosure Documents, at the time of the filing of such Company
Disclosure Documents or any supplement or amendment thereto with the SEC and
at the time such Company Disclosure Documents or any supplements or
amendments thereto are first distributed or disseminated to the Companys
stockholders, will not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit
to state any material fact necessary in order to make the statements made
therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not
misleading. __

 

(i) The information with respect to the Company that the Company furnishes to
Parent or Purchaser in writing specifically for use in the Schedule TO and
the Offer Documents, at the time of the filing of the Schedule TO and at the
time of any distribution or dissemination of the Offer Documents, will not
contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any
material fact necessary in order to make the statements made therein, in
light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading.

 

(ii) Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company makes no representation with
respect to statements made or incorporated by reference therein based on
information supplied by or on behalf of Parent or Purchaser for inclusion or
incorporation by reference in the Company Disclosure Documents.

 

3.5 Absence of Changes. Since December 31, 2014 through the date of this
Agreement, (a) except for discussions, negotiations and transactions related
to this Agreement or other potential strategic transactions, the Acquired
Corporations have operated in all material respects in the ordinary course of
business consistent with past practice and (b) there has not occurred any
event, change, action, failure to act or transaction that, individually or in
the aggregate, has had or would be reasonably expected to have, a Material
Adverse Effect. Since December 31, 2014 through the date of this Agreement,
the Acquired Corporations have not taken any actions which, had such actions
been taken after the date of this Agreement, would have required the written

audited balance sheet as of December 31, 2014 included in the last Annual
Report on Form 10-K (the " _Balance Sheet_ ") filed by the Company with the
SEC but excluding intellectual property which is covered by Section 3.8,
except for assets sold or otherwise disposed of in the ordinary course of

(a) The Acquired Corporations do not own and have not owned any real property.

 

(b) Except as would not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse
Effect, the Acquired Corporations hold a valid and existing leasehold

Acquired Corporations from another Person (the " _Leased Real Property_ "),
free and clear of all Encumbrances other than Permitted Encumbrances. None of
the Acquired Corporations have received any written notice regarding any
violation or breach or default under any Company Lease that has not since been
cured, except for violations or breaches that are not, individually or in the
aggregate, reasonably likely to have a Material Adverse Effect.

3.8 Intellectual Property.

 

(a) Part 3.8(a)(i) of the Company Disclosure Schedule sets forth a true and
complete list, identifying (i) the name of applicant/registrant and current
title owner in the U.S., (ii) the jurisdiction of application/registration and
(iii) the application or registration number for each item, of all Registered
IP owned by any Acquired Corporation. (A) The Registered IP required to be
set forth on Part 3.8(a)(i) of the Company Disclosure Schedule (other than
applications for Registered IP) is subsisting, and, to the knowledge of the
Company, enforceable and valid, (B) none of such Registered IP has been
misused, withdrawn, cancelled or abandoned, and (C) all application,
registration, issuance, renewal and maintenance fees due for such Registered
IP having a final due date on or before the date hereof have been paid
in full and are current. Each of the patents and patent applications included
in the Registered IP that are owned solely or jointly by an Acquired
Corporation properly identifies by name each and every inventor of the claims
thereof as determined in accordance with applicable Legal Requirements of the
United States. The Acquired Corporations are aware of no information or data
that is inconsistent with any statement made or data presented to the
applicable patent office by the Acquired Corporations or their patent
counsels during the prosecution of a patent application that is (x) listed, or
required to be listed, in Part 3.8(a)(i) of the Company Disclosure Schedule,
or (y) in the priority chain of a patent listed, or required to be listed, in 
Part 3.8(a)(i) of the Company Disclosure Schedule. Other than as set forth on
Part 3.8(a)(ii) of the Company Disclosure Schedule, to the knowledge of the
Company (which for purposes of this sentence shall mean the actual knowledge
of the executive officers of the Company without any requirement to conduct
any inquiry) and without giving effect to 35 U.S.C. 271(e)(1) and any other
Legal Requirements of similar effect in any jurisdiction, the
Acquired Corporations own exclusively and possess all right, title and
interest in and to or have the right to use, pursuant to a valid and
enforceable agreement, all material Company IP, free and clear of all
Encumbrances other than Permitted Encumbrances, which includes all
Intellectual Property Rights that are necessary for the operation of the
business of the Acquired Corporations as currently conducted the following
activities as proposed to be conducted as of the date of this Agreement (i)
the development and commercialization of SD-809 for the treatment of chorea
associated with Huntingtons Disease, tardive dyskinesia and tics associated
with Tourette syndrome as proposed to be conducted as of the date of
this Agreement, and (ii) the development of (A) SD-560 for the treatment of

 



17\.  idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis and (B) SD-1077 for the treatment of
Parkinsons disease. Except as set forth on Part 3.8(a)(iii) of the Company
Disclosure Schedule, neither the execution and delivery of this Agreement nor
the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby will conflict with,
alter or impair, any of the Acquired Corporations rights in or to any Company
IP or cause any supplemental payments of any kind to any Person as a result
of the Closing. There has not been since January 1, 2013 with respect to the
Company and since January 31, 2015 with respect to the German Subsidiary, and
there is not pending or, to the knowledge of the Company, threatened as of
the date of this Agreement, other than as set forth on Part 3.8(a)(iv) of the
Company Disclosure Schedule, any interference, opposition, cancellation,
reissue, reexamination or other proceeding of any nature (other than
initial examination proceedings) in which the scope, validity,
registrability, enforceability, use or ownership of any Registered IP required
to be listed on Part 3.8(a)(i) of the Company Disclosure Schedule is being or
has been contested or challenged. 

(b) No Company Associate owns or has any claim, right (whether or not
currently exercisable) or interest to or in any Company IP that is owned or
purported to be owned solely by an Acquired Corporation, and each Company
Associate who is or was involved in the creation or development of any such
Company IP pursuant to such Company Associates activities on behalf of
the Company, has signed a valid, enforceable agreement containing an
assignment to an Acquired Corporation of a present grant of exclusive
ownership of all Intellectual Property Rights developed by such Company
Associate (without further payment being owed to any such Company Associate
and without any restrictions or obligations on such Acquired Corporations
ownership and use thereof), or where such an assignment is not permitted under
applicable Legal Requirements, an exclusive license of such Intellectual
Property Rights, which license is described on Part 3.8(b) of the Company
Disclosure Schedule, and confidentiality provisions protecting such Company
IP, which, to the knowledge of the Company, has not been materially breached
by such Company Associate. Without limiting the foregoing, all Acquired
Corporations have taken commercially reasonable steps to protect, maintain and
enforce all Company IP, including the secrecy, confidentiality and value of
trade secrets and other confidential information.

(c) To the knowledge of the Company, no funding, facilities or personnel of
any Governmental Body or any university, college, research institute or other
educational institution has been or is being used, directly or indirectly, to
create, in whole or in part, Intellectual Property Rights owned or purported
to be owned by an Acquired Corporation, except for any such funding or use of
facilities or personnel that does not result in such Governmental Body or
institution obtaining ownership rights or any other similar right, title or
interest (including any "march in" rights) in or to such Intellectual
Property Rights (including any claim or option to any of the foregoing).

(d) Part 3.8(d) of the Company Disclosure Schedule sets forth each license
agreement pursuant to which an Acquired Corporation (i) licenses in any
Intellectual Property Right (each an " _In-bound License_ ") or (ii) licenses
out, or has granted any option, covenant not to sue, or other right or
immunity under, any Intellectual Property Right owned by or material
Intellectual Property Right licensed by an Acquired Corporation, or grants any
development or commercialization rights in or to any of the Products (each an
" _Out-bound License_ ") (provided,

 



18\.  that, (A) In-bound Licenses shall not include (1) agreements for
commercially available off-the-shelf software on nondiscriminatory pricing
terms, and (2) clinical trial agreements and material transfer agreements
entered into in the ordinary course of business and not granting any
commercial rights to any of the Products, and (B) Out-bound Licenses shall not
include clinical trial agreements, material transfer agreements, sponsored
research agreements and research collaboration agreements entered into in the
ordinary course of business and not granting any commercial rights to any of
the Products).

 

(e) To the knowledge of the Company and without giving effect to 35 U.S.C.
271(e)(1) and any other Legal Requirements of similar effect in any
jurisdiction: (i) the operation of the business of the Acquired Corporations
as currently conducted and the following activities as proposed to be
conducted as of the date of this Agreement (x) the development and
commercialization of 
SD-809 for the treatment of chorea associated with Huntingtons Disease,
tardive dyskinesia and tics associated with Tourette syndrome, and (y) the
development of (A) SD-560 for the treatment of idiopathic pulmonary
fibrosis and (B) SD-1077 for the treatment of Parkinsons disease, has not,
does not and will not infringe, misappropriate or otherwise violate any patent
rights or any other valid and enforceable Intellectual Property Rights owned
by any other Person; and (ii) the commercialization of the current
composition of matter form (but not the formulation, method of manufacture,
method of treatment or any other aspect) of (A) SD-560 for the treatment of
idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis and (B) SD-1077 for the treatment of
Parkinsons disease has not, does not and will not infringe any issued patents
or any valid and enforceable patent applications. To the knowledge of the
Company and without giving effect to 35 U.S.C. 271(e)(1) and any other Legal
Requirements of similar effect in any jurisdiction, no other Person is
infringing, misappropriating or otherwise violating any Company IP owned by an
Acquired Corporation. There has not been since January 1, 2013 with respect
to the Company and since January 31, 2015 with respect to the German
Subsidiary, and there is not pending and served (or, to the knowledge of the
Company, being threatened or pending and not been served) against an
Acquired Corporation or by an Acquired Corporation as of the date of this
Agreement, any Legal Proceeding claiming any actual, alleged or suspected
infringement, misappropriation or other violation of any Intellectual Property
Rights of another Person by an Acquired Corporation or of any Company IP
owned by an Acquired Corporation by another Person. Since January 1, 2013, the
Company has not, and since January 31, 2015, the German Subsidiary has not,
received any written notice or other written communication of any claim
relating to any actual, alleged or suspected infringement, misappropriation or
other violation of any Intellectual Property Right of another Person by an
Acquired Corporation, and, to the knowledge of the Company, there are no
facts that would provide a reasonable basis for such claim.

(f) None of the Acquired Corporations is now nor has ever been a member or
promoter of, or a contributor to, any industry standards body or any similar
organization that would reasonably be expected to require or obligate any of
the Acquired Corporations to grant or offer to any other Person any license
or right to any Company IP.

(g) None of the Company IP owned or purported to be owned by an Acquired
Corporation is subject to any pending or outstanding injunction, directive,
order, decree, award, settlement, judgment or other disposition of dispute
that would reasonably be expected to adversely restrict the use, transfer,
registration or licensing of any such Company IP by the

 



19\.  Acquired Corporations or otherwise would reasonably be expected to adversely
affect the validity, scope, use, registrability, or enforceability of any
Company IP owned or purported to be owned by an Acquired Corporation.

been revoked or cured, except for violations or breaches that are not,

case, not primarily related to Taxes and entered into in the ordinary course
of business).

 



26\. (k) The unpaid Taxes of the Acquired Corporations (A) did not, as of the date
of the most recent month end, exceed the reserve for Tax liability (rather
than any reserve for deferred Taxes established to reflect timing differences
between book and Tax income) set forth on the face of the Balance Sheet
(rather than in any notes thereto) and (B) do not exceed that reserve as
adjusted for the passage of time through the Closing Date in accordance with
the past custom and practice of the Acquired Corporations in filing their Tax
Returns. Since the date of the Balance Sheet, none of the Acquired
Corporations has incurred any liability for Taxes arising from extraordinary
gains or losses, as that term is used in GAAP, outside the ordinary course of
business consistent with past custom and practice.

 

(l) None of the Acquired Corporations will be required to include any item of
income in, or exclude any item of deduction from, taxable income for any
taxable period (or portion thereof) ending after the Closing Date as a result

the Closing Date;

(ii) use of an improper method of accounting for a taxable period ending on
or prior to the Closing Date;

(iii) "closing agreement" as described in Section 7121 of the Code (or any
corresponding or similar provision of state, local, or non-U.S. income Tax
law) executed on or prior to the Closing Date;

 

(iv) intercompany transaction or excess loss account described in Treasury
Regulations under Section 1502 of the Code (or any corresponding or similar
provision of state, local, or non-U.S. income Tax law) entered into or arising
on or prior to the Closing Date;

 

(v) installment sale or open transaction disposition made on or prior to the
Closing Date;

 

(vi) prepaid amount received on or prior to the Closing Date, other than in
the ordinary course of business; or

 

(vii) election under Section 108(i) of the Code.

 

(m) None of the Acquired Corporations (A) is a "controlled foreign
corporation" as defined in Section 957 of the Code, (B) is a "passive foreign
investment company" within the meaning of Section 1297 of the Code, or (C) has
a permanent establishment (within the meaning of an applicable Tax treaty) or
otherwise has an office or fixed place of business in a country other than
the country in which it is organized.

(n) None of the Acquired Corporations has received any letter ruling from the
Internal Revenue Service (or any comparable ruling from any other taxing
authority).

 



27\. (o) The Acquired Corporations have granted Parent sufficient access to its
stock ledger necessary for Parent to evaluate the historical application of

3.16 Employee Matters; Benefit Plans.

 

(a) Except as required by applicable Legal Requirements, the employment of
each of the Acquired Corporations employees is terminable by the applicable
Acquired Corporation at will.

(b) No Acquired Corporation is or, since January 31, 2015, with respect to
the German Subsidiary, has been a party to, or has a duty to bargain for or is
currently negotiating in connection with entering into, any collective
bargaining agreement, works council agreement, or other Contract with a
labor organization representing any of its employees and there are no labor
organizations representing, purporting to represent or, to the knowledge of
the Company, seeking to represent any employees of an Acquired Corporation.
Since January 1, 2013, with respect to the Company, and since January 31,
2015 with respect to the German Subsidiary, there has not been any strike,
slowdown, work stoppage, lockout, job action, picketing, labor dispute,
question concerning labor representation, union organizing activity, or any
threat thereof, or any similar activity or dispute, affecting an Acquired
Corporation or any of its employees. There is not now pending, and, to the
knowledge of the Company, no Person has threatened to commence, any such
strike, slowdown, work stoppage, lockout, job action, picketing, labor
dispute, question regarding labor representation or union organizing activity
or any similar activity or dispute. No Acquired Corporation is required to
notify, consult or negotiate with any labor union, works council, or other
employee representative body concerning the terms of employment of their
respective employees or the Transactions. Since January 1, 2013, with respect
to the Company, and since January 31, 2015, with respect to the German

absence, plant closing notification, employment statute or regulation, privacy
right, labor dispute, workers compensation policy or long-term disability
policy, safety, retaliation, immigration or discrimination matters involving
any Company Associate, including charges of unfair labor practices or
harassment complaints. Since January 1, 2013, with respect to the Company, and
since January 31, 2015, with respect to the German Subsidiary, the
Acquired Corporations have complied in all material respects with all
applicable Legal Requirements related to employment, including employment
practices, wages, hours and other terms and conditions of employment
(including the classification and compensation of employees for purposes of
the Fair Labor Standards Act and cognate state laws), classification of
workers as employees or independent contractors, and other Legal Requirements
in respect of any reduction in force, including notice, information and
consultation requirements, the lack of compliance with which has not had and
would not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect. In the
past two years, there has been no "mass layoff," "employment loss," or "plant
closing" as defined by the WARN Act or any other Law in respect of any Company
Person nor has any Company Person been affected by any transaction or engaged
in any lay-offs or employment terminations sufficient in number to trigger
application of any such law.

 



28\. (c) Intentionally Omitted.

 

(d) Part 3.16(d) of the Company Disclosure Schedule sets forth an accurate and
complete list of each Employee Plan (other than (A) any employment,
termination or severance agreement for non-officer employees of any Acquired
Corporation, (B) equity grant notices, and related documentation, with respect
to employees of the Acquired Corporations, and (C) agreements with
consultants in entered into in the ordinary course of business in the case of
(B), to the extent such agreements or notices do not materially deviate from
the form of such agreement or notice that has been delivered or
made available to Parent or Parents Representatives) (and, in the case of
any PEO Company Employee Plan, to the extent provided to the Company by the
PEO or in the possession of the Company). The Company has either delivered or
made available to Parent or Parents Representatives prior to the execution
of this Agreement, with respect to each Employee Plan, accurate and complete
copies of: (i) all plan documents and all amendments thereto, and all related
trust or other funding documents, and in the case of unwritten material
Employee Plans, written descriptions thereof; (ii) all determination letters,
rulings, opinion letters, information letters or advisory opinions issued by
the IRS or the United States Department of Labor (" _DOL_ "); (iii) the most
recent annual audited financial statement and actuarial valuation, if any, and
the most recent annual report (Form Series 5500 and all schedules and
financial statements attached thereto); (iv) the most recent summary plan
descriptions and any modifications thereto; (v) the most recent
nondiscrimination tests required to be performed under the Code (including
401(k) and 401(m) tests) for each Employee Plan; and (vi) all material
correspondence to or from the IRS, the DOL, or any other Governmental Body.
The Company does not self-insure any Employee Plan.

 

(e) Each Sponsored Company Employee Plan may be amended, terminated or
otherwise modified by the Acquired Corporation (with the written consent of
the affected Company Associate to the extent applicable with respect to any
Company Employee Agreement or Company Equity Award) to the greatest extent
permitted by applicable law, including the elimination of any and all future
benefit accruals thereunder and no employee communications or provision of
any Sponsored Company Employee Plan has failed to effectively reserve the
right of the Acquired Corporation to so amend, terminate or otherwise modify
such Sponsored Company Employee Plan (with the written consent of an affected
Company Associate to the extent applicable with respect to any Company
Employee Agreement or Company Equity Award). Neither the Acquired Corporation
nor any of its ERISA Affiliates has announced its intention to modify or
terminate any Employee Plan or adopt any arrangement or program which, once
established, would come into the definition of an Employee Plan. Each asset
held under each Sponsored Company Employee Plan may be liquidated
or terminated without the imposition of any redemption fee, surrender charge
or comparable liability to the extent permitted by applicable Law and with any
affected Company Associate and Acquired Corporation written consent if
necessary to the extent applicable with respect to any Company Employee
Agreement or Company Equity Award.

(f) Neither an Acquired Corporation nor any of its ERISA Affiliates has ever
sponsored, maintained, contributed to, or been required to sponsor, maintain
or contribute to a plan subject to Title IV or Section 302 of ERISA or Code
Sections 412 or 4971, including any "single employer" defined benefit plan or
any "multiemployer plan" each as defined in

 



29\.  Section 4001 of ERISA. No condition exists that is likely to cause the
Acquired Corporation or any of its ERISA Affiliates to incur a liability under
Title IV of ERISA. No Employee Plan is a plan that has two or more
contributing sponsors at least two of whom are not under common control,
within meaning of Section 4063 of ERISA.

 

(g) Each of the Sponsored Company Employee Plans and, to the knowledge of the
Company, each PEO Company Employee Plan (i) that is intended to be qualified
under Section 401(a) of the Code has obtained a favorable determination letter
(or opinion letter, if applicable) as to its qualified status under the Code,
(ii) each such Employee Plan has timely adopted all currently effective
amendments to the Code, and, (iii) to the knowledge of the Company, there are
no existing circumstances or any events that have occurred that would
reasonably be expected to materially and adversely affect the
qualified status of any such Employee Plan. Each of the Sponsored Company
Employee Plans, and to the knowledge of the Company, each PEO Company Employee
Plan, is now and has been operated, administered and maintained in compliance
in all material respects with its terms and all applicable Legal
Requirements, including but not limited to ERISA and the Code. The Acquired
Corporations are not nor reasonably could be subject to either a material
liability pursuant to Section 502 of ERISA or a Tax imposed pursuant to
Section 4975 or 4976 of the Code. There are no pending, or to the knowledge of
the Company, threatened or anticipated claims, actions, investigations or
audits (other than routine claims for benefits) by, on behalf of or against
any of the Sponsored Company Employee Plans or any trusts related thereto.

(h) Except to the extent required under Section 601 et seq. of ERISA or 4980B
of the Code (or any other similar state or local Legal Requirement), neither
any Acquired Corporation nor any Employee Plan has any present or future
obligation to provide post-employment welfare benefits to or make any payment
to, or with respect to, any present or former employee, officer or director of
an Acquired Corporation pursuant to any retiree medical benefit plan or other
retiree welfare plan.

 

(i) Neither the execution and delivery of this Agreement nor the consummation
of the Transactions (either alone or in combination with other events or
circumstances) will (i) entitle any current or former Company Associate to
severance pay, unemployment compensation or any other cash payment, (ii)
accelerate the time of payment, funding or vesting, or increase the
amount of, compensation or benefits due to any such Company Associate, (iii)
directly or indirectly cause the Acquired Corporations to transfer or set
aside any material assets to fund any benefits under any Employee Plan, (iv)
otherwise give rise to any material liability under any Employee Plan or (v)
limit or restrict the right to amend, terminate or transfer any material
assets of any Employee Plan on or following the Effective Time.

 

(j) Each Employee Plan or other Contract that is subject to Section 409A of
the Code has been maintained, operated and administered in compliance with
its terms and the operational and documentary requirements of Section 409A of
the Code and the regulations thereunder, except for any instances of
noncompliance that would not reasonably be expected to result in a material
liability to the Acquired Corporations. The Acquired Corporations do not have
an obligation to gross-up, indemnify or otherwise reimburse any current or
former service provider to an Acquired Corporation for any tax incurred by
such service provider pursuant to Section 409A of the Code.

 



30\. (k) No Employee Plan, individual or collectively, could give rise to the
payment of any amount that would not be deductible pursuant to Section 162(m)
of the Code or any other provision of the Code or any similar foreign law, as
a result of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement alone or together
with any other event. 

(l) Each Employee Plan maintained outside of the United States has been
operated in conformance with the applicable statutes or governmental
regulations and rulings related to such plans in the jurisdictions in which
such Employee Plan is present or operates and all such Employee Plans that are
required to be funded are fully-funded.

 

3.17 Environmental Matters. Except for those matters that would not reasonably
be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect, (a) the Acquired Corporations
are, and since January 1, 2013, with respect to the Company, and since January
31, 2015, with respect to the German Subsidiary, have been, in compliance in
all material respects with all applicable Environmental Laws, which

requirements on the part of the respective Acquired Corporations relating to
or arising under Environmental Laws, (d) to the knowledge of the Company, (1)
no Person has been exposed to any Hazardous Materials at a property or
facility of an Acquired Corporation and (2) there are and have been no
Hazardous Materials present or Released on, at, under or from any property or
facility, including the Leased Real Property, in both cases in a manner and
concentration that would reasonably be expected to result in any claim against
or liability of an Acquired Corporation under any Environmental Law, and (e)
no Acquired Corporation has assumed, undertaken, or otherwise become
subject to any liability of another Person relating to Environmental Laws
other than any indemnities in Material Contracts or leases for real property.

 

3.18 Insurance. The Company has delivered or made available to Parent or
Parents Representatives an accurate and complete copy of all insurance
policies and all self-insurance programs and arrangements relating to the
business, assets and operations of the Acquired Corporations. Except as would
not reasonably be expected to be materially adverse to the Acquired
Corporations, all such insurance policies are in full force and effect, no
notice of cancellation or modification has been received, all premiums due
thereunder have been paid and there is no existing default or event which,
with the giving of notice or lapse of time or both, would constitute a
default by any insured thereunder.

execution and delivery by Parent and Purchaser, this Agreement constitutes the
legal, valid and binding obligations of the Company and is enforceable against
the Company in accordance with its terms, subject to (i) laws of general
application relating to bankruptcy, insolvency and the relief of debtors and

reasonable advance notice to the Company, the Acquired Corporations shall, and
shall cause the respective Representatives of the Acquired Corporations to:
(a) provide Parent and Parents Representatives with reasonable access during

reasonably request; _provided, however,_ that any such access shall be
conducted at Parents expense, at a reasonable time, under the supervision of
appropriate personnel of the Acquired Corporations and in such a manner as
not to unreasonably interfere with the normal operation of the business of the
Acquired Corporations. Nothing herein shall require the Acquired Corporations
to disclose any information to Parent if such disclosure would, in its

 



36\. _ _ reasonable discretion (i) jeopardize any attorney-client or other legal
privilege (so long as the Acquired Corporation has used commercially
reasonable efforts to permit such inspection of or to disclose such
information on a basis that does not waive such privilege with respect
thereto) or (ii) contravene any applicable Legal Requirement, fiduciary duty
or binding agreement entered into prior to the date of this Agreement

reasonable efforts to make appropriate substitute arrangements to permit
reasonable disclosure not in violation of such Legal Requirement, agreement
or duty); ___provided, further,_ __that information may be disclosed subject
to execution of a joint defense agreement in customary form, and
disclosure may be limited to external counsel for Parent, to the extent the

unless the Companys Board of Directors reaffirms the Company Board
Recommendation in such disclosure or in connection with such action.

Company or any Acquired Corporation to execute or enter into any Contract

that would otherwise materially impede, interfere with or be inconsistent
with, the Transactions (other than an Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement)
(an " _Alternative Acquisition Agreement_ ").

 

(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, at
any time prior to Purchaser accepting, for the first time, for payment such
number of Shares validly tendered and not properly withdrawn pursuant to the
Offer as satisfies the Minimum Condition (the " _Offer Acceptance Time_ "):

 

(i) if the Company has received a _bona fide_ written Acquisition Proposal
(which Acquisition Proposal did not arise out of a breach of Section 5.3)
from any Person that has not been withdrawn and after consultation with
outside legal counsel and financial advisors, the Companys Board of Directors
shall have determined, in good faith, that such Acquisition Proposal is a
Superior Offer, (x) the Companys Board of Directors may make a Company
Adverse Change Recommendation, or (y) the Company may terminate this

 



43\.  Agreement to enter into a Specified Agreement with respect to such Superior
Offer, if and only if: (A) the Companys Board of Directors determines in good

failure to do so would reasonably constitute a breach of the fiduciary duties
of the Board of Directors of the Company to the Companys stockholders under
applicable Legal Requirements; (B) the Company shall have given Parent prior
written notice of its intention to consider making a Company Adverse Change
Recommendation or terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 8.1(f) at least

Company shall have provided to Parent a summary of the material terms and
conditions of the Acquisition Proposal and copies of all material written
materials related thereto in accordance with Section 5.3(d), (2) the Company

Notice to propose revisions to the terms of this Agreement or make another
proposal so that such Acquisition Proposal would cease to constitute a
Superior Offer, and shall have negotiated in good faith with Parent with
respect to such proposed revisions or other proposal, if any, (3) after
considering the results of such negotiations and giving effect to the
proposals made by Parent, if any, after consultation with outside legal
counsel and financial advisors, the Companys Board of Directors shall have
determined, in good faith, that such Acquisition Proposal is a Superior Offer
and that the failure to make the Company Adverse Change Recommendation or
terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 8.1(f) would reasonably
constitute a breach of fiduciary duties of the Board of Directors of the
Company to the Companys stockholders under applicable Legal Requirements, and
(4) if the Company intends to terminate this Agreement to enter into a
Specified Agreement, the Company shall have complied with Section 8.1(f).
Issuance of any "stop, look and listen" communication by or on behalf of the
Company pursuant to Rule 14d-9(f) shall not be considered a Company Adverse
Change Recommendation and shall not require the giving of a Determination
Notice or compliance with the procedures set forth in this Section 6.1. For
the avoidance of doubt, the provisions of this Section 6.1(b)(i) shall also
apply to any material amendment to any Acquisition Proposal and require a new
Determination Notice, except that the references to four (4) business days

Board of Directors may make a Company Adverse Change Recommendation in
response to a Change in Circumstance, if and only if: (A) the Companys Board

a breach of the fiduciary duties of the Board of Directors of the Company to
the Companys stockholders under applicable Legal Requirements; (B) the
Company shall have given Parent a Determination Notice at least four (4)
business days prior to making any such Company Adverse Change Recommendation;

reasonable detail, (2) the Company shall have given Parent the four (4)
business days after the Determination Notice to propose revisions to the terms
of this Agreement or make another proposal so that such Change in Circumstance
would no longer necessitate a Company Adverse Change Recommendation, and
shall have negotiated in good faith with Parent with respect to such proposed
revisions or other proposal, if any, and (3) after considering the results of
such negotiations and giving effect to the proposals made by Parent, if any,
after consultation with outside legal counsel, the Companys Board of

 



44\.  Directors shall have determined, in good faith, that the failure to make the
Company Adverse Change Recommendation in response to such Change in
Circumstance would reasonably constitute a breach of fiduciary duties of the
Board of Directors of the Company to the Companys stockholders under
applicable Legal Requirements. For the avoidance of doubt, the provisions of
this 
Section 6.1(b)(ii) shall also apply to any material change to the facts and
circumstances relating to such Change in Circumstance and require a new
Determination Notice, except that the references to four (4) business days
shall be deemed to be three (3) business days.

and Parent, would limit the right of Purchaser or Parent to own or operate
all or any portion of their respective businesses, products or assets in a
manner that would have a material adverse effect on the business of the
Company or on the business of the Purchaser or Parent and in no event shall
Purchaser or Parent be required to divest or license any currently marketed
products.

each Party hereto shall give the other Parties prompt notice of any pending
or threatened request, inquiry, investigation, action or Legal Proceeding
brought by a Governmental Body, or brought by a third party before any

"Antitrust Investigation"). In connection with any such Antitrust
Investigation, and subject to applicable Laws relating to the exchange of
information and appropriate agreements to limit disclosure to

Governmental Body in connection with such applications or filings for the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Neither Party shall commit to or
agree with any Governmental Body to stay, toll or extend any applicable

withhold in its sole discretion, the Company shall not commit to any

action with respect to the operation or ownership of the Company or the
Companys businesses, products or assets, or the businesses, products or
assets of Purchaser or Parent.

 

6.3 Company Stock Awards; ESPP.

by treating the last business day prior to the Offer Acceptance Time as the
last day of such offering period and purchase period and by making such other
pro-rata adjustments as may be necessary to reflect the shortened offering
period and purchase period but otherwise treating such shortened offering
period and purchase period as a fully effective and completed offering period
and purchase period for all purposes under the ESPP. The Company shall
terminate the ESPP in its entirety effective as of the Offer Acceptance Time,
contingent upon the Effective Time. Prior to the Offer Acceptance Time, the
Company shall take all actions (including, if appropriate, amending the terms
of the ESPP) that are necessary to give effect to the transactions
contemplated by this Section 6.3(b).

 

6.4 Employee Benefits. For a period of one (1) year following the Effective
Time, Parent shall provide, or cause to be provided, to those employees of
the Company who are employed by the Company as of immediately prior to the
Effective Time and who continue to be actively employed by the Surviving
Corporation (or any Affiliate thereof) during such one year period (the "
_Continuing Employees_ ") (i) base salary and base wages, short-term cash
incentive compensation opportunities and commission opportunities and health
and welfare benefits (including any severance benefits and transaction or
retention bonuses but excluding defined benefit pension benefits, retiree
medical benefits and equity based compensation) that are substantially
comparable in the aggregate to such base salary and base wages, short-term
cash incentive compensation opportunities and commission opportunities and
health and welfare benefits (including any severance benefits and transaction
or retention bonuses but excluding defined benefit pension benefits, retiree
medical benefits and equity based compensation) provided to such Continuing
Employees immediately prior to the execution of this Agreement or if more
favorable to the Continuing Employee, (ii) base salary and base wages, short-
term cash incentive compensation opportunities and commission opportunities
and health and welfare benefits (including any severance benefits and
transaction or retention bonuses but excluding defined benefit pension
benefits, retiree medical benefits and equity based compensation) that
are substantially comparable in the aggregate to such base salary and base
wages, short-term cash incentive compensation opportunities and commission
opportunities and health and welfare benefits (including any severance
benefits and transaction or retention bonuses but excluding defined benefit
pension benefits, retiree medical benefits and equity based compensation)
provided to similarly situated employees of the Parent and its Subsidiaries
from time to time. Without limiting the foregoing: 

(a) With respect to any accrued but unused personal, sick or vacation time to
which any Continuing Employee is entitled pursuant to the personal, sick or
vacation policies applicable to such Continuing Employee immediately prior to
the Effective Time, Parent shall, or shall cause the Surviving Corporation to
and instruct its Affiliates to, as applicable (and without duplication of
benefits), assume the liability for such accrued personal, sick or vacation
time and allow such Continuing Employee to use such accrued personal, sick or
vacation time in accordance with the practice and policies of the Company.

 



47\. (b) Parent agrees that all Continuing Employees shall be eligible to continue
to participate in the Surviving Corporations health and welfare benefit
plans (to the same extent such Continuing Employees were eligible to
participate under the Companys health and welfare benefit plans immediately
prior to the Effective Time or if more favorable to the Continuing Employee
to the same extent as similarly situated employees of Parent and its
Subsidiaries, as applicable); _provided, however,_ that (i) nothing in this
Section 6.4 or elsewhere in this Agreement shall limit the right of Parent or
the Surviving Corporation to amend or terminate any such health or welfare
benefit plan at any time and (ii) if Parent or the Surviving Corporation
terminates any such health or welfare benefit plan, then the Continuing
Employees shall be eligible to participate in the Surviving Corporations
health and welfare benefit plans to the extent that coverage under such plans
is replacing comparable coverage under an Employee Plan in which
such Continuing Employee participated immediately before the Effective Time
or to the extent as similarly situated employees of Parent and its
Subsidiaries, as applicable. To the extent that service is relevant for
eligibility to participate in but not for purpose of benefit accrual under,
any health or welfare benefit plan of Parent and/or the Surviving Corporation,
then Parent shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to (i) waive all
limitations as to pre-existing conditions, exclusions and waiting periods
with respect to participation and coverage requirements applicable to the
Continuing Employees, to the extent that such conditions, exclusions and
waiting periods would not apply under a similar employee benefit plan in
which such employees participated prior to the Effective Time, and (ii) ensure
that such health or welfare benefit plan shall, for purposes of eligibility,
deductibles, co-payments and out-of-pocket maximums, credit Continuing
Employees for service and amounts paid prior to the Effective Time with the
Company to the same extent that such service and amounts paid was recognized
prior to the Effective Time under the corresponding health or welfare benefit
plan of the Company. Nothing in this Section 6.4 or elsewhere in this
Agreement shall be construed to create a right in any employee to employment
with Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any other Affiliate of the Surviving
Corporation and the employment of each Continuing Employee shall be "at will"
employment.

(c) The Acquired Corporations shall refrain from causing any employees of
the Acquired Corporations to suffer an "employment loss," as defined in the
WARN Act or any similar state or local law, in the ninety-one (91) days prior
to the Effective Time, without the prior written consent of Parent.

 

(d) The provisions of this Section 6.4 are solely for the benefit of the
Parties to this Agreement, and no provision of this Section 6.4 is intended
to, or shall, constitute the establishment or adoption of or an amendment to
any employee benefit plan for purposes of ERISA or otherwise and no current or
former employee or any other individual associated therewith shall be
regarded for any purpose as a third party beneficiary of the Agreement or have
the right to enforce the provisions hereof.

 

(e) Nothing herein shall limit any rights of any of the beneficiaries pursuant
to the Employee Plans set forth on Part 6.4 of the Company Disclosure
Schedule.

 



48\. 6.5 Indemnification of Officers and Directors.

 

(a) All rights to indemnification by the Company existing in favor of those
Persons who are directors and officers of the Company as of the date of this
Agreement (the " _Indemnified Persons_ ") for their acts and omissions
occurring prior to the Effective Time, as provided in the Certificate of
Incorporation and bylaws of the Company (as in effect as of the date of this
Agreement) and as provided in the indemnification agreements between the
Company and said Indemnified Persons (as set forth on Part 6.5(a) of the
Company Disclosure Schedule and in effect as of the date of this Agreement)
in the forms made available by the Company to Parent or Parents
Representatives prior to the date of this Agreement, shall survive the Merger
and shall be observed by the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries to the
fullest extent available under Delaware law for a period of six (6) years
from the Effective Time, and any claim made requesting indemnification
pursuant to such indemnification rights within such six-year period shall
continue to be subject to this Section 6.5(a) and the indemnification rights
provided under this Section 6.5(a) until disposition of such claim.

(b) From the Effective Time until the sixth anniversary of the date on which
the Effective Time occurs, Parent and the Surviving Corporation (together with
their successors and assigns, the " _Indemnifying Parties_ ") shall, to
the fullest extent permitted under applicable Legal Requirements, indemnify
and hold harmless each Indemnified Person in his or her capacity as an officer
or director of the Company against all losses, claims, damages, liabilities,
fees, expenses, judgments or fines incurred by such Indemnified Person as an
officer or director of the Company in connection with any pending or
threatened Legal Proceeding based on or arising out of, in whole or in part,
the fact that such Indemnified Person is or was a director or officer of the
Company at or prior to the Effective Time and pertaining to any and all
matters pending, existing or occurring at or prior to the Effective Time,
whether asserted or claimed prior to, at or after the Effective Time,
including any such matter arising under any claim with respect to the
transactions contemplated herein. Without limiting the foregoing, from the
Effective Time until the sixth anniversary of the date on which the Effective
Time occurs, the Indemnifying Parties shall also, to the fullest extent
permitted under applicable Legal Requirements, advance reasonable and
documented out-of-pocket costs and expenses (including reasonable and
documented attorneys fees) incurred by the Indemnified Persons in connection
with matters for which such Indemnified Persons are eligible to be indemnified
pursuant to this Section 6.5(b) after receipt by Parent of a written request
for such advance, subject to the execution by such Indemnified Persons of
appropriate undertakings in favor of the Indemnifying Parties to repay such
advanced costs and expenses if it is ultimately determined in a final and non-
appealable judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction that
such Indemnified Person is not entitled to be indemnified under this Section
6.5(b) or other applicable law.

(c) From the Effective Time until the sixth anniversary of the Effective
Time, the Surviving Corporation shall maintain in effect, the existing policy
of directors and officers liability insurance maintained by the Company as
of the date of this Agreement (an accurate and complete copy of which has
been made available by the Company to Parent or Parents Representatives prior
to the date of this Agreement) for the benefit of the Indemnified Persons who
are currently covered by such existing policy with respect to their acts and
omissions occurring prior to the Effective Time in their capacities as
directors and officers of the Company

 



49\.  (as applicable), on terms with respect to coverage, deductibles and amounts
no less favorable than the existing policy (or at or prior to the Effective
Time Parent or the Company may (through a nationally recognized insurance
broker approved by Parent (such approval not to be unreasonably withheld,
delayed or conditioned)) purchase a six-year "tail" policy for the existing
policy effective as of the Effective Time) and if such "tail policy" has been
obtained, it shall be deemed to satisfy all obligations to obtain and/or
maintain insurance pursuant to this Section 6.5(c); _provided, however,_ that
in no event shall the Surviving Corporation be required to expend an amount
in excess of 300% of the annual premium currently payable by the Company with
respect to such current policy, it being understood that if the total premiums
payable for such insurance coverage exceeds such amount, Parent shall
be obligated to cause the Surviving Corporation to obtain a policy with the
greatest coverage available for a cost equal to such amount.

 

(d) In the event Parent or the Surviving Corporation or any of their
respective successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any
other Person and shall not be the continuing or surviving corporation or
Entity of such consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers all or substantially
all of its properties and assets to any Person, then, and in each such
case, Parent shall ensure that the successors and assigns of Parent or the
Surviving Corporation, as the case may be, or at Parents option, Parent,
shall assume the obligations set forth in this Section 6.5.

 

(e) The provisions of this Section 6.5 shall survive the acceptance of Shares
for payment pursuant to the Offer and the consummation of the Merger and are
(i) intended to be for the benefit of, and shall be enforceable by, each of
the Indemnified Persons and their successors, assigns and heirs and (ii) in
addition to, and not in substitution for, any other rights to indemnification
or contribution that any such Person may have by contract or otherwise. Unless
required by applicable Legal Requirement, this Section 6.5 may not be amended,
altered or repealed after the Offer Acceptance Time in such a manner as to
adversely affect the rights of any Indemnified Person or any of their
successors, assigns or heirs without the prior written consent of the affected
Indemnified Person.

 

6.6 Securityholder Litigation. Subject to a customary joint defense agreement,
the Company shall give Parent the right to review and comment on all material
filings or responses to be made by the Company in connection with any
litigation against the Company and/or its directors relating to the
Transactions, the right to participate (at Parents expense) in such
litigation, and the right to consult on the settlement with respect to such
litigation, and the Company shall in good faith take such comments into
account, and, no such settlement shall be agreed to without Parents prior
written consent (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or
delayed). The Company shall promptly notify Parent of any such litigation and
shall keep Parent informed on a current basis with respect to the status
thereof.

 

6.7 Additional Agreements. Without limitation or contravention of the
provisions of Section 6.2, and subject to the terms and conditions of this
Agreement, Parent and the Company shall use commercially reasonable efforts to
take, or cause to be taken, all actions necessary to consummate the Offer and
the Merger and make effective the other Transactions. Without limiting the
generality of the foregoing, subject to the terms and conditions of this
Agreement, each Party to this Agreement shall (i) make all filings (if any)
and give all notices (if any)

 



50\.  required to be made and given by such Party in connection with the Offer and
the Merger and the other Transactions; (ii) use commercially reasonable
efforts to obtain each Consent (if any) required to be obtained pursuant to
any applicable Legal Requirement or Material Contract by such Party in
connection with the Transactions; and (iii) use commercially reasonable
efforts to lift any restraint, injunction or other legal bar to the Offer or
the Merger brought by any third Person against such Party. The Company shall
promptly deliver to Parent a copy of each such filing made, each such notice
given and each such Consent obtained by the Company during the Pre-Closing
Period. 

6.8 Disclosure. The initial press release relating to this Agreement shall be
a joint press release issued by the Company and Parent and thereafter Parent
and the Company shall consult with each other before issuing any further press
release(s) or otherwise making any public statement or making any announcement
to Company Associates (to the extent not previously issued or made in
accordance with this Agreement) with respect to the Offer, the Merger, this
Agreement or any of the other Transactions and shall not issue any such press
release, public statement or announcement to Company Associates without the
other Partys written consent. Notwithstanding the foregoing: (a) each Party
may, without such consultation or consent, make any public statement in
response to questions from the press, analysts, investors or those attending
industry conferences, make internal announcements to employees and make
disclosures in Company SEC Documents, so long as such statements are
consistent with previous press releases, public disclosures or public
statements made jointly by the parties (or individually, if approved by the
other Party), (b) a Party may, without the prior consent of the other Party
hereto but subject to giving advance notice to the other Party, issue any such
press release or make any such public announcement or statement as may be
required by Legal Requirement; and (c) the Company need not consult with
Parent in connection with such portion of any press release, public statement
or filing to be issued or made pursuant to Section 5.3(e) or with respect to
any Acquisition Proposal or Company Adverse Change Recommendation.

6.9 Takeover Laws; Advice of Changes.

 

(a) If any Takeover Law may become, or may purport to be, applicable to the
Transactions, each of Parent and the Company and the members of their
respective Boards of Directors shall use their respective reasonable best
efforts to grant such approvals and take such actions as are necessary so that
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement may be consummated as promptly
as practicable on the terms and conditions contemplated hereby and otherwise
act to lawfully eliminate the effect of any Takeover Law on any of the
Transactions.

 

(b) The Company shall give prompt notice to Parent (and shall subsequently
keep the other informed on a current basis of any developments related to
such notice) upon its becoming aware of the occurrence or existence of any
fact, event or circumstance that (i) has had or would reasonably be expected
to result in any Material Adverse Effect with respect to it and (ii) is
reasonably likely to result in any of the conditions set forth in Section 7 or
Annex I not being able to be satisfied prior to the End Date. Parent shall
give prompt notice to the Company (and shall subsequently keep the other
informed on a current basis of any developments related to such notice) upon
its becoming aware of the occurrence or existence of any fact, event or
circumstance that (i) has had or would reasonably be expected to have a Parent
Material Adverse Effect or (ii) is reasonably likely to result in any of the
conditions set forth in Section 7 not being able to be satisfied prior to the
End Date.

 



51\. 6.10 Section 16 Matters. The Company, and the Companys Board of
Directors, shall, to the extent necessary, take appropriate action, prior to
or as of the Offer Acceptance Time, to approve, for purposes of Section 16(b)
of the Exchange Act, the disposition and cancellation or deemed disposition
and cancellation of shares of Company Common Stock, Company Stock Awards and
Company Warrants in the Transactions by applicable individuals and to cause
such dispositions and/or cancellations to be exempt under Rule 16b-3
promulgated under the Exchange Act.

Affiliates and any of the officers, directors or employees of the Company that

(b) by either Parent or the Company if the Offer shall have expired without
the acceptance for payment of Shares pursuant to the Offer;  _provided,
however_ , that a Party shall not be permitted to terminate this Agreement
pursuant to this Section 8.1(b) if the failure of the acceptance for payment
of Shares pursuant to the Offer is attributable to a failure on the part
of such Party to perform in any material respect any covenant or obligation
in this Agreement required to be performed by such Party at or prior to the
acceptance for payment of Shares pursuant to the Offer and such Party has not
cured such failure within ten (10) days after having received notice thereof,
or if earlier, the End Date;

(c) by either Parent or the Company if a court of competent jurisdiction or
other Governmental Body shall have issued a decree or ruling, or shall have
taken any other action, having the effect of permanently restraining,
enjoining or otherwise prohibiting the acceptance for payment of Shares

Merger illegal, which order, decree, ruling or other action shall be final and
nonappealable; _provided, however_ , that a Party shall not be permitted
to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this Section 8.1(c) if the issuance
of such final and nonappealable order, decree, ruling or other action is
attributable to a failure on the part of such Party to perform in any material
respect any covenant or obligation in this Agreement required to be performed
by such Party at or prior to the Effective Time;

(d) by Parent at any time prior to the Offer Acceptance Time, if, whether or
not permitted to do so: (i) the Companys Board of Directors shall have failed

subject to Regulation 14D under the Exchange Act (other than by Parent and
its Affiliates), the Companys Board of Directors fails to recommend, in a

53\. (e) by either Parent or the Company if the Offer Acceptance Time shall not
have occurred on or prior to the close of business on September 29, 2015
(such date, the " _End Date_ "); _provided, however_ , that a Party shall not
be permitted to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this Section 8.1(e)
if the failure of the Offer Acceptance Time to occur prior to the End Date is
attributable to the failure on the part of such Party to perform in any
material respect any covenant or obligation in this Agreement required to be
performed by such Party; 

(f) by the Company, at any time prior to the Offer Acceptance Time, in order
to accept a Superior Offer and enter into a binding written definitive
acquisition agreement providing for the consummation of a transaction

Section 5.3 and Section 6.1(b)(i) and concurrently enters into the Specified
Agreement and pays the Termination Fee as provided in Section 8.3(b);

 

(g) by Parent at any time prior to the Offer Acceptance Time, if a breach of
any representation or warranty contained in this Agreement or failure to
perform any covenant or obligation in this Agreement on the part of the
Company shall have occurred such that the condition set forth in clause "(b)"
or "(c)" of Annex I would not be satisfied and cannot be cured by the Company
by the End Date, or if capable of being cured, shall not have been cured
within thirty (30) days of the date Parent gives the Company notice of such
breach or failure to perform or, if earlier, the End Date;
_provided, however_ , that, Parent shall not have the right to terminate this
Agreement pursuant to this Section 8.1(g) if either Parent or Purchaser is

of any representation or warranty contained in this Agreement or failure to
perform any covenant or obligation in this Agreement on the part of Parent or
Purchaser shall have occurred, in each case if such breach or failure has had
or would reasonably be expected to prevent Parent or Purchaser
from consummating the Transactions and such breach or failure cannot be cured
by Parent or Purchaser, as applicable, by the End Date, or if capable of being
cured, shall not have been cured within thirty (30) days of the date the
Company gives Parent notice of such breach or failure to perform or, if
earlier, the End Date; _provided, however_ , that, the Company shall not have
the right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this Section 8.1(h) if the
Company is then in material breach of any representation, warranty, covenant

meaning of Rule 14d-2 under the Exchange Act) the Offer within the period
specified in Section 1.1(a) or if Purchaser shall have failed to purchase all

as provided in Section 8.1, written notice thereof shall be given to the
other Party or Parties, specifying the provision hereof pursuant to which such
termination is made, and this Agreement

 



54\.  shall be of no further force or effect and there shall be no liability on
the part of Parent, Purchaser or the Company or their respective directors,

that (a) this Section 8.2, Section 8.3 and Section 9 shall survive the
termination of this Agreement and shall remain in full force and effect; (b)
the Confidentiality Agreement shall survive the termination of this Agreement
and shall remain in full force and effect in accordance with its terms; and

Party from exercising any rights or remedies it may have under Section 9.5(b)
in lieu of terminating this Agreement pursuant to Section 8.1. 

8.3 Expenses; Termination Fee.

(i) this Agreement is terminated by the Company pursuant to Section 8.1(f);

 

(ii) this Agreement is terminated by Parent pursuant to Section 8.1(d); or

 

(iii)(x) this Agreement is terminated pursuant to Section 8.1(b), Section
8.1(e) or Section 8.1(g), (y) any Person shall have publicly disclosed an
Acquisition Proposal or otherwise communicated an Acquisition Proposal to the
Companys Board of Directors after the date hereof and prior to such
termination (unless withdrawn prior to such termination and, in the case of a
publicly disclosed Acquisition Proposal, publicly withdrawn prior to such
termination) and (z) within twelve (12) months of such termination the Company
shall have entered into a definitive agreement with respect to any
Acquisition Proposal, recommended any Acquisition Proposal to its
stockholders, or consummated any Acquisition Proposal (provided that for
purposes of this clause (z) the references to "20%" in the definition of "
_Acquisition Proposal_ " shall be deemed to be references to "50%");

then, in any such event under clause "(i)", "(ii)" or "(iii)" of this Section
8.3(b), the Company shall pay to Parent or its designee the Termination Fee by
wire transfer of same day funds (x) in the case of Section 8.3(b)(i), on the
date that the Specified Agreement is executed (or, if the Specified Agreement

concurrently with the termination of this Agreement and execution of the
Specified Agreement, (y) in the case of Section 8.3(b)(ii), within two (2)
business days after such termination or (z) in the case of Section
8.3(b)(iii), concurrently with the applicable event referred to in subclause
(iii)(z) above; it being understood that in no event shall the Company be
required to pay the Termination Fee on more than one occasion. As used herein,
" _Termination Fee_ " shall mean a cash amount equal to $104,000,000. In the
event that Parent or its designee shall receive full payment pursuant to this
Section 8.3(b), the receipt of the Termination Fee shall be deemed to be

 



55\.  liquidated damages for any and all losses or damages suffered or incurred by
Parent, Purchaser, any of their respective Affiliates or any other Person in
connection with this Agreement (and the termination hereof), the transactions
contemplated hereby (and the abandonment thereof) or any matter forming the
basis for such termination, and none of Parent, Purchaser, any of their
respective Affiliates (collectively, " _Parent Related Parties_ ") or any
other Person shall be entitled to bring or maintain any claim, action or
proceeding against the Company or any of its Affiliates arising out of or in
connection with this Agreement, any of the Transactions or any matters
forming the basis for such termination; _provided, however,_ that nothing in
this Section 8.3(b) shall limit the rights of Parent or Purchaser under
Section 9.5(b) or with respect to common law fraud or willful and
material breach of this Agreement by the Company prior to the date of
termination.

(c) Parents right to receive payment from the Company of the Termination Fee
pursuant to Section 8.3(b) and any payments pursuant to Section 8.3(d) shall
be the sole and exclusive remedy of the Parent Related Parties against the
Company and any of their respective former, current or future officers,
directors, partners, stockholders, optionholders, managers, members or
Affiliates (collectively, " _Company Related Parties_ ") for any loss suffered
as a result of the failure of the Offer or the Merger to be consummated or
for a breach or failure to perform hereunder or otherwise, and upon payment of
such amount(s), none of the Company Related Parties shall have any further
liability or obligation relating to or arising out of this Agreement or
the Transactions; provided that nothing in this Section 8.3(c) shall relieve
the Company or any Company Related Party from any liability for common law
fraud or willful and material breach of this Agreement prior to the date of
termination.

 

(d) The Parties acknowledge that the agreements contained in this Section 8.3
are an integral part of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and
that, without these agreements, the Parties would not enter into this
Agreement; accordingly, if the Company fails to timely pay any amount due
pursuant to this Section 8.3, and, in order to obtain the payment, Parent
commences a Legal Proceeding which results in a judgment against the Company,
the Company shall pay Parent its reasonable and documented costs and expenses
(including reasonable and documented attorneys fees) in connection with such
suit, together with interest on such amount at the prime rate as published in
the Wall Street Journal in effect on the date such payment was required to be
made through the date such payment was actually received.

remedy; and no single or partial exercise of any such power, right, privilege
or remedy shall preclude any other or further exercise thereof or of any
other power, right, privilege or remedy. No Party shall be deemed to have

and thereof; _provided, however,_ that the Confidentiality Agreement shall

This Agreement may be executed in several counterparts, each of which shall
be deemed an original and all of which shall constitute one and the same

9.5 Applicable Legal Requirements; Jurisdiction; Specific Performance;
Remedies.

(a) This Agreement shall be governed by, and construed in accordance with, the
laws of the State of Delaware, regardless of the laws that might otherwise
govern under applicable principles of conflicts of laws thereof. Subject to
Section 9.5(c), in any action or proceeding arising out of or relating to this
Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement: (i) each
of the Parties irrevocably and unconditionally consents and submits to the
exclusive jurisdiction and venue of the Chancery Court of the State of
Delaware and any state appellate court therefrom or, if such court lacks
subject matter jurisdiction, the United States District Court sitting in New
Castle County in the State of Delaware, (it being agreed that the consents to
jurisdiction and venue set forth in this Section 9.5(a) shall not constitute
general consents to service of process in the State of Delaware and shall have
no effect for any purpose except as provided in this paragraph and shall not
be deemed to confer rights on any Person other than the Parties hereto); and
(ii) each of the Parties irrevocably consents to service of process by first
class certified mail, return receipt requested, postage prepaid, to the
address at which such Party is to receive notice in accordance with Section
9.8. The Parties hereto agree that a final judgment in any such action or
proceeding shall be conclusive and may be enforced in other jurisdictions by
suit on the judgment or in any other manner provided by applicable Legal
Requirements; _provided, however,_ that nothing in the foregoing shall
restrict any Partys rights to seek any post-judgment relief regarding, or any
appeal from, such final trial court judgment.

 

(b) The Parties agree that irreparable damage for which monetary damages, even
if available, would not be an adequate remedy, would occur in the event that
the Parties hereto do not perform their obligations under the provisions of
this Agreement in accordance with its specified terms or otherwise breach such
provisions. Subject to the following sentence, 

 



57\.  the Parties acknowledge and agree that (i) the Parties shall be entitled to
seek an injunction or injunctions, specific performance, or other equitable
relief, to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically the
terms and provisions hereof in the courts described in Section 9.5(a) without
proof of damages or otherwise, this being in addition to any other remedy to
which they are entitled under this Agreement, (ii) the provisions set forth
in Section 8.3 (A) are not intended to and do not adequately compensate for
the harm that would result from a breach of this Agreement and (B) shall not
be construed to diminish or otherwise impair in any respect any Partys right
to specific enforcement and (iii) the right of specific performance is an
integral part of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and without
that right, neither the Company nor Parent would have entered into this
Agreement. Each of the Parties hereto agrees that it will not oppose the
granting of an injunction, specific performance and other equitable relief on
the basis that the other Parties hereto have an adequate remedy at law or
an award of specific performance is not an appropriate remedy for any reason
at law or equity. The Parties hereto acknowledge and agree that any Party
seeking an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement and
to enforce specifically the terms and provisions of this Agreement in
accordance with this Section 9.5(b) shall not be required to provide any bond
or other security in connection with any such order or injunction.

 

(c) EACH OF THE PARTIES HERETO IRREVOCABLY WAIVES ANY AND ALL RIGHT TO TRIAL
BY JURY IN ANY LEGAL PROCEEDING BETWEEN THE PARTIES HERETO ARISING OUT OF OR
RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY.

9.6 Assignability. This Agreement shall be binding upon, and shall be
enforceable by and inure solely to the benefit of, the Parties hereto and
their respective successors and permitted assigns; _provided, however,_ that
neither this Agreement nor any of the rights hereunder may be assigned
without the prior written consent of the other Parties hereto, and any
attempted assignment of this Agreement or any of such rights without such
consent shall be void and of no effect; _provided, further, however,_ that
Parent or Purchaser may assign this Agreement to any of their Affiliates (
_provided_ that such assignment shall not impede or delay the consummation of
the Transactions or otherwise impede the rights of the stockholders of the
Company under this Agreement); _provided_ that no such assignment or pledge
permitted pursuant to this Section 9.6 shall relieve Parent of its obligations
hereunder.

 

9.7 No Third Party Beneficiaries. Nothing in this Agreement, express or
implied, is intended to or shall confer upon any Person (other than the
Parties hereto) any right, benefit or remedy of any nature whatsoever under or
by reason of this Agreement; except for: (i)(A) if the Offer Acceptance Time
occurs, the right of the Companys stockholders to receive the Offer Price in
accordance with the terms of the Offer Documents and (B) if the Effective Time

pursuant to Section 2.8; (ii) the provisions set forth in Section 6.5 of this
Agreement; and (iii) the limitations on liability of the Company
