representative on behalf of such Persons, which Payoff Letters together with
any related release documentation shall, among other things, include the
payoff amount (the "Payoff Amount") and provide in substance reasonably
acceptable to Buyer, among other things, that Liens (and guarantees), if any,
granted in connection therewith relating to the assets, rights and properties
of the Company and its Subsidiaries securing such Repayment Debt and any other
obligations secured thereby, shall be, upon the payment of the amount set

triggered as a result of the announcement or consummation of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement and (ii) initiating discussions with the
lenders or other Persons to

whom such debt is owed, or the applicable agent, trustee or other
representative therefor, or counterparty or factoring bank, as applicable, as

transactions contemplated by this Agreement (it being understood that the
Seller shall not, and shall cause the Company and its Subsidiaries not to,
enter into or solicit any such amendment or waiver or initiate or undertake
any such discussions in the absence of the consent of or request by the Buyer
therefor).

9.9

|

To the extent the Buyer does not agree with the Leakage Statement or there is
any additional Leakage from the date of such statement to the Closing (any
such amounts not agreed or incurred from the date of such statement, the
"Unresolved Items"), the Seller and the Buyer shall as soon as reasonably
practicable following the Closing and in any event within 20 Business Days
thereof seek in good faith to resolve such Unresolved Items and the Seller
shall promptly pay to the Buyer the amount of any such item so resolved. If
the Seller and the Buyer are unable to so resolve all Unresolved Items then,
at the request of either party, the Seller and the Buyer shall jointly engage
and submit the Unresolved Items to a certified public accounting firm
reasonably satisfactory to the Seller and the Buyer (the "Independent
Accountant"); provided that if the Seller and the Buyer do not appoint an
Independent Accountant within ten (10) days after either the Seller or the
Buyer gives notice to the other of such request, either of them may request
the Danish Institute of Arbitration to appoint as the Independent Accountant
an internationally recognized independent registered public accounting firm
based on its determination that such firm is independent from the Parties, and
such appointment shall be final, binding and conclusive on the Seller and the
Buyer. The Seller and the Buyer shall provide their written submissions to the
Independent Accountant within 30 days of the appointment of the Independent
Accountant, and use their reasonable best efforts to cause the Independent
Accountant to issue its written determination regarding the Unresolved Items
within thir- 































Page 23



ty (30) days after such items are submitted for review (or, if a party fails
to timely provide its written submission to the Independent Accountant in
accordance with this sentence, within 60 days after the appointment of the
Independent Accountant). Each party shall use its reasonable best efforts to
furnish to the Independent Accountant such work papers and other documents and
information pertaining to the Unresolved Items as the Independent Accountant
may request. The determination of the Independent Accountant shall be final,
binding and conclusive on the Seller and the Buyer absent manifest error. The
fees, expenses and costs of the Danish Institute of Arbitration and the
Independent Accountant shall be borne in the same proportion as the aggregate
value of the Unresolved Items that are unsuccessfully disputed by the Seller,
on the one hand, and the Buyer, on the other hand (as determined by the
Independent Accountant) bears to the total value of the Unresolved Items
submitted to the Independent Accountant.

15.1.7

|

The Buyer and the Company shall conduct all communications and negotiations
with the Danish tax authorities (SKAT) and other competent tax authorities
regarding all pre-closing periods of any Group Company, including the Final
Income Period; provided, that, to the extent that any such communications or
negotiations (or any examination, audit, challenge, dispute or claim with
