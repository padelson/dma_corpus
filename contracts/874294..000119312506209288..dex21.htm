ARTICLE III

MERGER CONSIDERATION; CONVERSION OR CANCELLATION OF COMPANY SHARES IN THE
MERGER

Section 3.1 _Effect on Capital Stock_. As of the Effective Time, by virtue of
the Merger and without any action on the part of Parent, Merger Sub or the
Company or their respective shareholders:

(a) _Capital Stock of Merger Sub_. Each issued and outstanding share of
common stock of Merger Sub shall be converted into and become one fully paid
and nonassessable share of common stock of the Surviving Corporation.

(b) _Cancellation of Parent Owned Stock_. Each Company Share owned by Parent
or any Subsidiary of Parent immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be
canceled, and no payment shall be made with respect thereto.

(c) _Conversion of Company Shares_. Each issued and outstanding Company Share
(other than (i) Company Shares to be canceled in accordance with Section
3.1(b) hereof and (ii) Dissenting Shares), together with any associated
Company Rights, shall automatically be converted into the right to receive an
amount in cash equal to $32.00, without interest (the "
_Merger Consideration_ "). All Company Shares converted into the right to
receive the Merger Consideration pursuant to this Section 3.1(c) shall cease
to be outstanding and shall be canceled and retired and shall cease to exist,
and each holder of a certificate that immediately prior to the Effective Time
represented such Company Shares (or in the case of a non-certificated share,
the equivalent right to such Company Shares) (" _Company Certificate_ ") shall
thereafter cease to have any rights with respect to such Company Shares,
except the right to receive the Merger Consideration to be issued in
consideration therefor.

(d) _Change in Shares_. If, between the date of this Agreement and the
Effective Time, there is a reclassification, recapitalization, stock split,
stock dividend, combination or exchange of shares with respect to, or rights
issued in respect of, Company Shares, the Merger Consideration shall be
adjusted accordingly to provide to the holders of Company Shares the same
economic effect as contemplated by this Agreement prior to such event.

(e) _Dissenting Company Shares_. Each outstanding Company Share, the holder of
which has demanded and perfected such holders right to dissent from the
Merger and to be paid the fair value of such shares in accordance with Section
23B.13 of the WBCA and, as of the Effective Time, has not effectively waived,
withdrawn or otherwise lost such dissenters rights (" _Dissenting Shares_
"), will not be converted into or represent a right to receive the Merger
Consideration, but the holder thereof will be



 

11 entitled only to such rights as are granted by the WBCA. The Company will give
Parent (i) prompt written notice of any notice of intent to demand fair value
for any Company Share, withdrawals of such notices, and any other instruments
received by the Company, and in respect of the exercise, perfection, or
attempt to exercise or perfect, dissenters rights and (ii) the opportunity
to conduct jointly all negotiations and proceedings with respect to such
demands for fair value for Company Shares under the WBCA. The Company will
not, except with the prior written consent of Parent, voluntarily make any
payment with respect to any demands for fair value for Company Shares or
settle or offer to settle any such demands.

Section 3.2  _Paying Agent; Exchange of Company Certificates_.

(a) Prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall designate a bank or trust
company, reasonably acceptable to the Company, to act as paying agent (the "
_Paying Agent_ ") for payment of the Merger Consideration.

(b) As of or promptly following the Effective Time, Parent shall deposit with
the Paying Agent, cash sufficient in the aggregate to provide all funds
necessary for the Paying Agent to make payments of the Merger Consideration
pursuant to Section 3.1.

(c) As soon as reasonably practicable following the Effective Time, the
Surviving Corporation shall cause the Paying Agent to mail to each holder of
record of Company Certificates (other than Company Certificates representing
Dissenting Shares) (i) a letter of transmittal that shall specify that
delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to Company
Certificates shall pass, only upon proper delivery of Company Certificates to
the Paying Agent and which shall be in the form and have such other provisions
as Parent may reasonably specify (the " _Letter of Transmittal_ ") and (ii)
instructions for use in effecting the surrender of Company Certificates in
exchange for the Merger Consideration. Upon surrender of a Company Certificate
for cancellation to the Paying Agent, together with a Letter of Transmittal
properly completed and validly executed in accordance with the instructions
thereto, and such other documents as may be reasonably required by the Paying
Agent, the holder of such Company Certificate shall be entitled to receive in
exchange therefor the Merger Consideration payable in respect of the number
of Company Shares previously represented by such Company Certificates, and
Company Certificates so surrendered shall be forthwith canceled. The Paying
Agent shall promptly accept such Company Certificates upon compliance with
such reasonable terms and conditions as the Paying Agent may impose to effect
an orderly exchange thereof in accordance with customary exchange practices.
No interest shall accrue on the Merger Consideration payable upon the
surrender of Company Certificates for the benefit of, or be paid to, the
holders of Company Certificates.

(d) All Merger Consideration delivered upon the surrender of Company
Certificates in accordance with the terms of this Article III shall be deemed
to have been paid in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to Company
Shares theretofore represented by such Company Certificates. Until
surrendered as contemplated by this Section 3.2, each Company Certificate
shall be deemed at all times after the Effective Time to represent only the
right to receive upon such surrender the Merger Consideration into which
Company Shares theretofore represented by such Company Certificate shall have
been converted pursuant to this Article III.



 

12 (e) At the Effective Time, the stock transfer books of the Company shall be
closed, and there shall be no further registration of transfers on the stock
transfer books of the Surviving Corporation of Company Shares that were
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time. If, after the Effective
Time, Company Certificates are presented to the Surviving Corporation or the
Paying Agent for any reason, they shall be canceled and exchanged as provided
in this Article III.

(f) If any Company Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed,
upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the Person claiming such
Company Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if reasonably
required by the Paying Agent, the posting by such Person of a bond or other
surety in such amount as the Paying Agent may reasonably direct as indemnity
against any claim that may be made with respect to such Company Certificate
and subject to such other reasonable conditions as the Paying Agent may
impose, the Paying Agent shall deliver in exchange for such Company
Certificate the Merger Consideration into which Company Shares theretofore
represented by such Company Certificate shall have been converted pursuant to
this Article III. 

(g) If any payment under this Article III is to be made to a Person other than
the Person in whose name any Company Certificate surrendered in exchange
therefor is registered, it shall be a condition of payment that the Company
Certificate so surrendered shall be properly endorsed or otherwise in proper
form for transfer and that the Person requesting such payment shall pay any
transfer or other Taxes required by reason of the payment to a Person other
than the registered holder of Company Certificate surrendered or such Person
shall establish to the satisfaction of the Surviving Corporation that such Tax
has been paid or is not applicable.

(h) The Paying Agent shall invest any funds held by it for purposes of this
Section 3.2 as directed by Parent, on a daily basis; provided that no such
investment or loss thereon shall affect the amounts payable to the Companys
shareholders pursuant to this Article III. Any interest and other income
resulting from such investments shall be paid to Parent.

(i) Parent and/or the Paying Agent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold
from the consideration otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement to the
holders of Company Shares such amounts, if any, as are required to be deducted
or withheld under any provision of U.S. federal Tax Law, or any provision of
state, local or foreign Tax Law, with respect to the making of such payment.
Amounts so withheld shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as
having been paid to the holders of Company Shares in respect of which such
deduction or withholding was made.

(j) None of Parent, Merger Sub, the Company or the Paying Agent shall be
liable to any Person in respect of any cash delivered to a public
official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar
Law. Any portion of the cash that has been made available to the Paying Agent
pursuant to this Section 3.2 that remains



 

13 unclaimed by the holder of any Company Certificate twelve months after the
Effective Time, shall be returned to Parent and any such holder who has not
exchanged such holders Company Certificate prior to such time shall
thereafter look only to Parent for any claim for Merger Consideration
hereunder.

Section 3.3 _Equity Awards_.

(a)  _Treatment of Company Options_. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company
shall take all action necessary such that, as of the Effective Time, each
Company Option that is outstanding as of immediately prior to the Effective
Time, whether or not vested or exercisable, shall be canceled and the holder
thereof shall be entitled to receive an amount of cash, without interest,
equal to the product of (i) the total number of Company Shares subject to such
Company Option as of immediately prior to the Effective Time, whether or not
vested or exercisable, multiplied by (ii) the excess, if any, of the Merger
Consideration over the exercise price per Company Share subject to such
Company Option (with the aggregate amount of such payment to the holder to be
rounded down to the nearest cent), less applicable Taxes, if any, required to
be withheld with respect to such payment. Parent shall pay, or shall cause the
Surviving Corporation to pay, the amount of cash payable in respect of each
Company Option as soon as practicable following the Effective Time, but in any
event no later than 10 Business Days following the Effective Time.

(b) _Restricted Stock_. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall take
all action necessary such that, immediately prior to the Effective Time, all
restrictions (including all forfeiture restrictions or repurchase rights)
applicable to Company Shares subject to Restricted Stock Awards, whether or
not vested, shall lapse.

(c) _Restricted Units_. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall take
all action necessary such that, as of the Effective Time, each outstanding
Restricted Unit Award, whether or not vested, shall be cancelled and the
holder thereof shall be entitled to receive an amount of cash, without
interest, equal to the product of (i) the total number of Company Shares
subject to such Restricted Unit Award as of immediately prior to the Effective
Time, whether or not vested, multiplied by (ii) the Merger Consideration
(with the aggregate amount of such payment to the holder to be rounded down to
the nearest cent), less applicable Taxes, if any, required to be withheld with
respect to such payment. Parent shall pay, or shall cause the Surviving
Corporation to pay, the amount of cash payable in respect of each Restricted
Unit Award as soon as practicable following the Effective Time, but in any
event no later than 10 Business Days following the Effective Time.

(d) _Corporate Actions_. At or prior to the Effective Time, the Board of
Directors of the Company (or, if appropriate, any committee of the Board
of Directors of the Company responsible for administering the Company Equity
Plans) shall adopt any resolutions and cause the Company to take any actions
which are necessary to effectuate the provisions of this Section 3.3,
including, without limitation, obtaining all necessary consents from award
holders.



 

14 (e) _No Right to Acquire Company Shares_. The Company shall take all actions
necessary to ensure that from and after the Effective Time neither Parent nor
the Surviving Corporation will be required to deliver Company Shares to any
Person pursuant to or in settlement of Company Options after the Effective
Time.

Subsidiaries or (ii) to a product or chemical composition under development
by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, shall be excluded; or (ix) any

not accrued,



 

20 absolute, contingent, unliquidated or otherwise, whether due or to become due
and whether or not required to be disclosed (including any liability for
breach of contract, breach of warranty, torts, infringements, claims or
lawsuits), that would be reasonably likely to have, individually or in the
aggregate, a Company Material Adverse Effect.

Section 4.9 _Benefit Plans; Employees and Employment Practices_.

(a) Section 4.9 of the Company Disclosure Schedule contains a list of all
"employee pension benefit plans" (as defined in Section 3(2) of the Employee
Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended (" _ERISA_ ")) (sometimes
referred to herein as " _Pension Plans_ "), "employee welfare benefit plans"
(as defined in Section 3(1) of ERISA and sometimes referred to herein as "
_Welfare Plans_ ") and each other " _Benefit Plan_ " (defined herein as any
Pension Plan, Welfare Plan and any other plan, fund, program, arrangement or
agreement (including any employment or consulting agreement but excluding
any individual award agreements under Company Equity Plans) to provide
employees, directors, independent contractors, consultants, officers or agents
with medical, health, life, bonus, stock or stock-based rights (option,
ownership or purchase), retirement, deferred compensation, severance, salary
continuation, vacation, sick leave, fringe, incentive insurance or other
benefits) maintained, or contributed to, or required to be contributed to, by
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries for the benefit of any current or
former independent contractors, consultants, agents, employees, officers or
directors of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries. The Company has delivered
or made available to Parent true, complete and correct copies of (i) each
Benefit Plan (or, in the case of any unwritten Benefit Plans, descriptions of
the material terms thereof), (ii) the most recent annual report on Form 5500
filed with the IRS with respect to each Benefit Plan (if any such report was

Plan for which such summary plan description is required, (iv) each trust
agreement and group annuity contract relating to any Benefit Plan; (v) any
model award agreement under the Company Equity Plans, and (vi) the most
recent determination letter from the IRS, if any. Neither the Company nor any
of its Subsidiaries have undertaken or committed to make any material
amendments to any Benefit Plan or to adopt or approve any new plans.

(b) Each Benefit Plan has been established, funded, maintained and
administered in all material respects in accordance with its terms and is in
compliance in all material respects with the applicable provisions of ERISA,
the Code, and all other applicable Laws. All Company Options have been granted
with an exercise price per share no lower than the "fair market value" of a
Company Share on the date of grant, as determined in accordance with the terms
of the applicable option plan, the Company Charter Documents and applicable
Law. All Company Options have been properly accounted for by the Company in
accordance with GAAP.

(c) All Pension Plans intended to be Tax qualified under the Code have been
the subject of favorable and up-to-date (through any applicable remedial
amendment period) determination letters from the IRS, or a timely application
therefor has been filed, to the effect that such Pension Plans are qualified
and exempt from federal income taxes under Section 401(a) and 501(a),
respectively, of the Code, and no such



 

21 determination letter has been revoked nor has any such Pension Plan been
amended since the date of its most recent determination letter or application
therefor in any respect that would adversely affect its qualification; and, to
the Knowledge of the Company, no circumstances exist and no events have
occurred that could adversely affect the qualification of any Pension Plan or
the related trust. No trust funding any Benefit Plan is intended to meet the
requirements of Section 501(c)(9) of the Code.

(d) Neither the Company, nor any of its Subsidiaries, nor any other Person
that, together with the Company, is or was treated as a single employer under
Section 414(b), (c), (m) or (o) of the Code (the Company and each such other
Person a "Commonly Controlled Entity") has during the past six years (i)
maintained, sponsored or been required to contribute to a plan subject to
Title IV or Section 302 of ERISA or Section 412 or 4971 of the Code or (ii)
been required at any time or is required currently to contribute to any
"multiemployer plan" (as defined in Section 4001(a)(3) of ERISA).

(e) With respect to any Welfare Plan, (i) no such Welfare Plan is funded
through a "welfare benefits fund", as such term is defined in Section 419(e)
of the Code and (ii) each such Welfare Plan that is a "group health plan", as
such term is defined in Section 5000(b)(1) of the Code and any Benefit Plan
that is maintained by a Commonly Controlled Entity, complies in all material
respects with the applicable requirements of Section 4980B(f) of the Code.

(f) Neither the Company, nor any of its Subsidiaries, nor any Person acting on
behalf of the Company or its Subsidiaries has made or entered into any
legally binding commitment with, any current or former directors, officers,
employees, consultants or independent contractors of the Company, any of its
Subsidiaries to the effect that, following the date hereof, (i) any benefits
or compensation provided to such persons under existing Benefit Plans or under
any other plan or arrangement will be amended to provide enhanced or
accelerated benefits, (ii) any new plans or arrangements providing benefits
or compensation will be adopted, (iii) any Benefit Plans will be continued for
any period of time or cannot be amended or terminated at any time or for any
reason, (iv) any plans or arrangements provided by Parent will be made
available to such employees, or (v) any trusts or other funding mechanisms
will be required to be funded.

(g) Neither the Company, nor any of its Subsidiaries has any material
liability for life, health, medical or other welfare benefits for former
employees or beneficiaries or dependents thereof under Benefit Plans, other
than Pension Plans and other than as required by Section 4980B of the Code,
Part 6 of Title I of ERISA or other applicable Law.

(h) All contributions or premiums owed by the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries with respect to Benefit Plans under Law, contract or otherwise
have been made in full and on a timely basis and the Company or its
Subsidiaries are not obligated to contribute with respect to any Benefit Plan
that involves a retroactive contribution, assessment or funding waiver
arrangement. All administrative costs attributable to Benefit Plans have been
paid when due.



 

22 (i) To the Companys Knowledge, no Pension Plan or Welfare Plan or any
"fiduciary" or "party-in-interest" (as such terms are respectively defined by
Sections 3(21) and 3(14) of ERISA) thereto has engaged in a transaction
prohibited by Section 406 of ERISA or 4975 of the Code for which a valid
exception is not available.

(j) There are no pending or, to the Companys Knowledge, threatened, claims,
lawsuits, arbitrations or audits asserted or instituted against any Benefit
Plan, any fiduciary (as defined by Section 3(21) of ERISA) thereto, the
Company, any of its Subsidiaries or any employee or administrator thereof in
connection with the existence, operation or administration of a Benefit Plan,
other than routine claims for benefits.

(k) Nothing in this Agreement or the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement will: (i) trigger a right, whether or not conditioned upon
termination of employment or changes in duties or responsibilities, of any
employee of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to severance, deferred
compensation or retirement benefits under any agreement or arrangement to
which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is a party; (ii) trigger a right
or payment, whether or not conditioned upon termination of employment or
changes in duties or responsibilities, under any agreement or arrangement to
which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is a party, that would be
considered a parachute payment within the meaning of Section 280G of the Code
or any reimbursement of any excise taxes under Section 4999 of the Code or
any income taxes under the Code; or (iii) cause any early withdrawal or
premature termination penalty with respect to any asset held in connection
with any Benefit Plan. The Company has made available to Parent a complete
and correct schedule, as of the date of this Agreement, of the annual base
salary and annual target bonus of each executive officer of the Company.

(l) Neither the Company nor its Subsidiaries is a party to any labor or
collective bargaining agreement. There are no controversies, strikes, work
stoppages, slowdowns, lockouts, arbitrations or other material labor disputes
pending or, to the Knowledge of the Company, threatened between the Company
or its Subsidiaries and any representatives of any of their employees. To the
Knowledge of the Company, there are no material organizational efforts
presently being made involving any of the presently unorganized employees of
the Company or its Subsidiaries. There are no pending or, to the Knowledge of
the Company, threatened complaints, charges or claims against the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries brought or filed with any Governmental Entity,
arbitrator or court based on, arising out of, in connection with or otherwise
relating to the employment or termination of employment by any of the Company
or any of its Subsidiaries or, relating to the employees or other persons
providing services to or on behalf of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries.

(m) The Company and its Subsidiaries are in compliance in all material
respects with all Laws and Orders applicable to such entity or the employees
or other persons providing services to or on behalf of such entity, as the
case may be, relating to the employment of labor, including all such laws,
regulations and orders relating to wages, hours, employment standards, the
WARN Act, Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, Age Discrimination in
Employment Act, Americans with Disabilities Act, Equal Pay Act, HIPAA, ERISA,
Family and Medical Leave Act, discrimination, civil rights, safety and

23 Section 4.10 _Material Contracts_.

(a) Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries, or to the Knowledge of
the Company, any other party, is in violation or breach of or in default
(nor, to the Knowledge of the Company, does there exist any condition which
upon the passage of time or the giving of notice would result in a violation
or breach of, or constitute a default under, or give rise to any right of
termination, amendment, cancellation, acceleration or loss of benefits, or
result in the creation of any Lien (other than Permitted Liens) upon any of
the properties or assets of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries) under, any
Material Contract to which the Company is a party or by which the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries or any of their respective properties or assets is

providing for "at will" employment that can be terminated without resulting
in any liability for severance obligations) involving an amount in excess of
$50,000 over the term of such agreement or arrangement or consulting agreement
or arrangement involving minimum payment obligations in excess of $250,000
over the remaining term of such agreement or arrangement; (iii) non-

Company or such Subsidiary in excess of $175,000 from and after the Closing
Date (after giving effect to any reduction in payment obligations under such
agreement or arrangement upon a proper termination of such agreement or
arrangement in accordance with its terms) or (B) a full-time equivalent
commitment of the Company or such Subsidiary from and after the Closing Date;
or (xi) Contracts that are "material contracts" (as such term is defined in
Item 601(b)(10) of Regulation S-K). Each Contract or understanding of the type
described in this Section 4.10(b), whether or not set forth in the Company
Disclosure Schedule, is referred to herein as a " _Material Contract_."

Section 4.11 _Insurance_. The Company has delivered to Parent prior to the
date of this Agreement copies of all insurance policies currently in effect
which are owned by the Company or its Subsidiaries or which name the Company
or any of its Subsidiaries as an insured (or loss payee), including those
which pertain to the Companys or its Subsidiaries assets, employees or
operations. All such insurance policies are in full force and effect, are
valid and enforceable, and all premiums due thereunder have been paid. Neither
the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries have received notice of cancellation
of any such insurance policies.

Section 4.12 _Litigation_. There is no material suit, claim, action,
proceeding, arbitration or investigation pending before any
Governmental Entity or, to the Knowledge of the Company, threatened against
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or their respective assets or
properties. Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries is subject to any
outstanding Order or Orders. There is no action, suit, proceeding or
investigation pending or, to the Knowledge of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries, threatened against the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, which
seeks to restrain, enjoin or delay the consummation of the Merger or any of
the other transactions contemplated hereby or which seeks damages in
connection therewith, and no injunction has been entered or issued.

Section 4.13 _Compliance with Applicable Law_.

(a) The Company and its Subsidiaries hold all material permits,
licenses, variances, exemptions, Orders and approvals of all Governmental
Entities necessary for the lawful conduct of their respective businesses (the
" _Company Permits_ "). The Company and its Subsidiaries are in compliance
with the terms of the Company Permits, except for such failures to comply
that are not, in the aggregate, material. The businesses of the Company and
its Subsidiaries have not been, and are not being, conducted in violation of
any Law other than violations that are not, in the aggregate, material. This
Section 4.13(a) does not relate to compliance with Drug or Health Laws, which
is exclusively the subject of Section 4.20.



 

25 (b) The Company is not an "investment company" under the Investment Company
Act of 1940, as amended, and the rules and regulations promulgated by the SEC
thereunder.

(c) The Company and each of its officers and directors are in compliance
with, and have complied, in all material respects with (i) the applicable
provisions of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and the related rules and
regulations promulgated under such act (the " _Sarbanes-Oxley Act_ ") or the
Exchange Act and (ii) the applicable listing and corporate governance rules
and regulations of The Nasdaq Stock Market, Inc.s Global Select Market. There
are no outstanding loans made by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to
any executive officer (as defined under Rule 3b-7 under the Exchange Act) or
director of the Company. Since the enactment of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act,
neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has made any loans to any
executive officer or director of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries. The
Company has established and maintains disclosure controls and procedures (as
such term is defined in Rule 13a-14 under the Exchange Act); such disclosure
controls and procedures are designed to ensure that material information
relating to the Company, including its consolidated Subsidiaries, is made
known to the Companys principal executive officer and its principal financial
officer by others within those entities, particularly during the periods in
which the periodic reports required under the Exchange Act are being prepared;
and such disclosure controls and procedures are effective in timely alerting
the Companys principal executive officer and its principal financial officer
to material information required to be included in the Companys periodic
reports required under the Exchange Act. The Companys principal executive
officer and its principal financial officer have disclosed, based on their
most recent evaluation, to the Companys auditors and the audit committee of
the Board of Directors of the Company (i) all significant deficiencies in the
design or operation of internal controls which could adversely affect
the Companys ability to record, process, summarize and report financial data
and have identified for the Companys auditors any material weaknesses in
internal controls and (ii) any fraud, whether or not material, that
involves management or other employees who have a significant role in the
Companys internal controls. For purposes of this paragraph, "principal
executive officer" and "principal financial officer" shall have the meanings
given to such terms in the Sarbanes-Oxley Act.

Section 4.14 _Taxes and Tax Returns_.

(a) All material Tax Returns required to be filed by or with respect to the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries for all Taxable Periods (or
portions thereof) ending on or before the Closing Date have been duly and
timely filed (taking into account any extension of time within which to file).
All such Tax Returns (i) are true, correct, and complete in all material
respects and (ii) accurately reflect the material liability for Taxes of each
of the Company and its Subsidiaries.

(b) True and complete copies of all federal, state, local and foreign Tax
Returns of or including the Company or any of its Subsidiaries for all Taxable
Periods ending on or after December 31, 2003 have been provided or made
available to Parent prior to the date hereof. Since the date of the Companys
last financial statements,



 

26 neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has incurred any liability for
Taxes that would result in a material decrease in the net worth of the
Company or any such Subsidiary and that are outside the ordinary course of
business or otherwise inconsistent with past custom and practice.

(c) All material Taxes due and owing by the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries, whether or not shown (or required to be shown) on a Tax Return,
have been timely paid. The reserve for Tax liability set forth in the balance
sheet contained in the most recent consolidated financial statements of the
Company and its Subsidiaries included in the Company Filed SEC Documents was
sufficient (as determined in accordance with GAAP) for the unpaid Taxes of
the Company and its Subsidiaries as of such date.

(d) No deficiencies for Taxes have been claimed, proposed or assessed against
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries in writing by any taxing or other
Governmental Entity which have not been resolved and settled in full, and none
of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries has received any notice, or
otherwise has any Knowledge, of any potential claim, proposal or assessment
against the Company or any of its Subsidiaries for any such deficiency for
Taxes. There are no pending or, to the Companys Knowledge, threatened
audits, investigations or claims for or relating to any material liability of
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries in respect of Taxes. None of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries has entered into a closing agreement
pursuant to Section 7121 of the Code.

(e) Without duplication of Section 4.14(c), each of the Company and each of
its Subsidiaries has duly and timely withheld, collected, paid and reported
to the proper governmental authority all Taxes required to have been withheld,
collected, paid or reported.

(f) No claim has ever been made by any Taxing authority with respect to the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries in a jurisdiction where the Company or such
Subsidiary does not file Tax Returns that the Company or such Subsidiary is or
may be subject to a material amount of Tax by that jurisdiction.

(g) There are no liens or other security interests upon any property or
assets of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries for Taxes, except for liens
for Taxes not yet due and payable.

(h) Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has waived any statute of
limitations in respect of Taxes or agreed to any extension of time with
respect to a Tax assessment or deficiency, which waiver or extension is
currently in effect. No power of attorney that is currently in force has been
granted by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries with respect to any matters
relating to Taxes.

(i) Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has (i) been a member of
an affiliated group (within the meaning of Section 1504 of the Code) or an
affiliated, combined, consolidated, unitary, or similar group for state or
local Tax purposes, other 



 

27 than the group of which the Company is the common parent or (ii) any liability
for the Taxes of another Person (other than the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries) under Treas. Reg. Section 1.1502-6 (or any similar provision of
state, local or foreign Law), as a transferee or successor, by contract or
otherwise.

(j) Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has agreed or is required
to include in income any adjustment under either Section 481(a) or Section
482 of the Code (or an analogous provision of state, local, or foreign Law) by
reason of a change in accounting method or otherwise. Neither the Company nor
any Subsidiary has any application pending with any Taxing authority
requesting permission for any change in any accounting method. The IRS has
not proposed any such adjustment or change in accounting method.

(k) Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries is a party to any
contract, agreement, plan or arrangement relating to allocating or sharing the
payment of, indemnity for, or liability for, Taxes with respect to any Taxable
Period.

(l) Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has constituted either a
"distributing corporation" or a "controlled corporation" in a distribution of
stock qualifying for tax-free treatment under Section 355 of the Code (x) in
the two years prior to the date of this Agreement or (y) in a distribution
which could otherwise constitute part of a "plan" or "series of related
transactions" (within the meaning of Section 355(e) of the Code) in
conjunction with the Merger.

(m) None of the indebtedness of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
constitutes (i) "corporate acquisition indebtedness" (as defined in Section
279(b) of the Code) with respect to which any interest deductions may be
disallowed under Section 279 of the Code or (ii) an "applicable high yield
discount obligation" under Section 163(i) of the Code.

(n) The Company is not, and has not been, a "United States real property
holding corporation" within the meaning of Section 897(c)(2) of the Code
during the applicable period specified in Section 897(c)(1)(A)(ii) of
the Code.

(o) Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has engaged in any "listed
transaction" within the meaning of Treasury Regulation §1.6011-4(b)(2).

Section 4.15 _Hazardous Substances_. There is not and has not been any Release
or threat of Release of any Hazardous Substance at, on, under or from any
location currently or formerly owned or operated by the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries, or to the Knowledge of the Company, from any other location
resulting from or arising in connection with the operations of the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries, except for any Release that would not be reasonably
likely to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Company Material Adverse
Effect.

Section 4.16 _State Takeover Statutes_. The action of the Board of Directors
of the Company in approving the Merger, this Agreement and the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement is sufficient to render inapplicable to Parent,
the Merger



 

28 and this Agreement the provisions of Section 23B.19 of the WBCA. No other
"control share acquisition," "fair price" or other anti-takeover regulations
enacted under state or federal laws in the United States which are applicable
to the Company apply to this Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated
hereby and thereby.

Section 4.17 _Rights Agreement_. The Company has taken all actions necessary
to cause the Company Rights Agreement to be amended (such amendment referred
to as the " _Rights Agreement Amendment_ ") to (a) render the Company Rights
Agreement inapplicable to this Agreement, the Merger and the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, (b) ensure that (i) none of
Parent, Merger Sub or any other affiliate of Parent is an "Acquiring Person"
(as defined in the Company Rights Agreement) pursuant to the Company Rights
Agreement and (ii) a Distribution Date or a Share Acquisition Date (as such
terms are defined in the Company Rights Agreement) does not occur, in the case
of clauses (i) and (ii), by reason of the execution of this Agreement or the
consummation of the Merger or the other transactions contemplated by
this Agreement and (c) provide that the Expiration Date (as defined in the

the Company Rights Agreement and the Rights Agreement Amendment.

after the date hereof and was made after the date hereof and did not
otherwise result from a breach of this Section 6.3, the Company may, if its
Board of Directors determines in good faith (after consulting with outside
counsel) that it is required to do so in order to comply with its fiduciary
duties to the shareholders of the Company under applicable Law, and subject to
compliance with Section 6.3(b), (i) furnish information with respect to the
Company and its Subsidiaries to the Person making such Takeover Proposal (and
its representatives) pursuant to a customary confidentiality agreement not
less restrictive of such Person than the Confidentiality Agreement, _provided_
that all such information has previously been provided to Parent or is
provided to Parent prior to or substantially concurrent with the time it is
provided to such Person, and (ii) participate in discussions or negotiations
with the Person making such Takeover Proposal (and its representatives)
regarding such Takeover Proposal.

(b) Neither the Board of Directors of the Company nor any committee thereof
shall (i) (A) withdraw (or modify in a manner adverse to Parent), or publicly
propose to withdraw (or modify in a manner adverse to Parent), the approval,
recommendation or declaration of advisability by such Board of Directors or
any such committee thereof of this Agreement, the Merger or the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement or (B) recommend, adopt or
approve, or propose publicly to



 

41 recommend, adopt or approve, any Takeover Proposal (any action described in
this clause (i) being referred to as a " _Company Adverse Recommendation
Change_ ") or (ii) approve or recommend, or propose to approve or recommend,
or allow the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to execute or enter into, any
letter of intent, memorandum of understanding, agreement in principle, merger
agreement, acquisition agreement, option agreement, joint venture agreement,
partnership agreement or other similar agreement constituting or related to,
or that is intended to or would reasonably be expected to lead to, any
Takeover Proposal (other than a confidentiality agreement referred to in
Section 6.3(a)). Notwithstanding the foregoing, at any time prior to obtaining
the Company Shareholder Approval, the Board of Directors of the Company may
(A) make a Company Adverse Recommendation Change in response to a Superior
Proposal or an Intervening Event if such Board of Directors determines in good
faith (after consultation with a financial advisor of nationally
recognized reputation and outside counsel) that it is required to do so in
order to comply with its fiduciary duties to the shareholders of the Company
under applicable Law and/or (B) upon termination of this Agreement in
accordance with Section 8.1(c)(ii) and concurrent payment of the Termination
Fee in accordance with Section 8.4(a), approve and enter into an agreement
relating to a Takeover Proposal that constitutes a Superior Proposal;
_provided_ , _however_ , that (x) the Company shall not take any action set
forth in clauses (A) or (B) of this sentence until after the fifth Business
Day following Parents receipt of written notice (a " _Notice_ ") from the
Company advising Parent that the Board of Directors of the Company intends to
take such action and specifying the reasons therefor, including the terms and
conditions of any Superior Proposal and, if applicable in the case of clause
(A), information describing such Intervening Event in reasonable detail, that
is the basis of the proposed action by the Board of Directors (it being
understood and agreed that any amendment to the financial terms or any other
material term of such Superior Proposal or material change in such
Intervening Event shall require a new Notice and a new five Business Day
period); (y) during such five Business Day period the Company shall negotiate
with Parent in good faith to make such adjustments to the terms and
conditions of this Agreement as would enable the Company to proceed with its
recommendation of this Agreement and not take any action set forth in clauses
(A) or (B) of this sentence and (z) the Company shall not take any action set
forth in clauses (A) or (B) of this sentence if, prior to the expiration of
such five Business Day period, Parent makes a proposal to adjust the terms and
conditions of this Agreement that the Companys Board of Directors determines
in good faith (after consultation with its financial advisors) to be at least
as favorable as the Superior Proposal or, if applicable in the case of clause
(A), the Intervening Event.

(c) The Company agrees that in addition to the obligations of the Company set
forth in paragraphs (a) and (b) of this Section 6.3, within 24 hours of the
Companys Knowledge of receipt thereof, the Company shall advise Parent orally
and in writing of any request for information or any Takeover Proposal, or any
inquiry, discussions or negotiations with respect to any Takeover Proposal
and the terms and conditions of such request, Takeover Proposal, inquiry,
discussions or negotiations and the Company shall promptly provide to Parent
copies of any written materials received by the Company in connection with any
of the foregoing, and the identity of the Person or group making any such
request, Takeover Proposal or inquiry or with whom any discussions or
negotiations are taking place. The Company agrees that it shall keep



 

42 Parent informed in all material respects of the status and terms (including
amendments or proposed amendments) of any such request, Takeover Proposal or
inquiry and shall keep Parent informed as to the details of any information
provided by the Company, unless such information has been previously provided
to Parent.

(d) Nothing contained in this Section 6.3 shall prohibit the Company from
taking and disclosing to its shareholders a position contemplated by
Rules 14d-9 and 14e-2 promulgated under the Exchange Act; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that in no event shall the Company or its Board of Directors or
any committee thereof take, or agree or resolve to take, any action prohibited
by Section 6.3(b).

(e) The Company agrees that immediately following the execution of this
Agreement it shall request each Person which has heretofore executed a
confidentiality agreement in connection with such Persons consideration of
acquiring the Company to return or destroy (which destruction shall be
certified in writing by an executive officer of the Company) all confidential
information heretofore furnished to such Person by or on its behalf.

Section 6.4 _Company Shareholder Meeting; Preparation of the Proxy
Statement_.

(a) The Company shall, as promptly as practicable following the execution of
this Agreement, establish a record date for, duly call, give notice of,
convene and hold the Company Shareholder Meeting. Subject to Sections 6.3(b)
and 6.3(d), the Company shall, through its Board of Directors, recommend to
its shareholders adoption of this Agreement and shall include such
recommendation in the Proxy Statement. Without limiting the generality of the
foregoing, the Companys obligations pursuant to the first sentence of this
Section 6.4(a) shall not be affected by (i) the commencement, public
proposal, public disclosure or communication to the Company of any Takeover
Proposal or (ii) any Company Adverse Recommendation Change.

(b) As promptly as practicable following the date of this Agreement, the
Company shall prepare and file with the SEC the preliminary Proxy Statement
and shall cause the mailing of the definitive Proxy Statement to
the shareholders of the Company to occur as promptly as reasonably
practicable following clearance of the Proxy Statement by the SEC. Each of the
Company and Parent shall furnish all information concerning such Person to the
other as may be reasonably requested in connection with the preparation,
filing and distribution of the Proxy Statement. The Company shall promptly
notify Parent upon the receipt of any comments from the SEC or its staff or
any request from the SEC or its staff for amendments or supplements to the
Proxy Statement and shall provide Parent with copies of all correspondence
between it and its Representatives, on the one hand, and the SEC and its
staff, on the other hand. Each of the Company and Parent shall use
its reasonable efforts to respond as promptly as practicable to any comments
of the SEC with respect to the Proxy Statement. Notwithstanding any of the
foregoing sentences in this paragraph, prior to filing or mailing the Proxy
Statement (or any amendment or supplement thereto) or responding to any
comments of the SEC with respect thereto, the Company (i) shall provide Parent
an



 

43 opportunity to review and comment on such document or response, (ii) shall
take into good faith consideration all comments reasonably proposed by Parent
and (iii) shall not file such document prior to receiving the approval of
Parent, which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed. If at
any time prior to the Company Shareholder Meeting, any information relating
to the Company, Parent or any of their respective affiliates, officers or
directors, should be discovered by the Company or Parent that should be set
forth in an amendment or supplement to the Proxy Statement, so that the
Proxy Statement shall not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or
omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to
make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they
are made, not misleading, the party that discovers such information shall
promptly notify the other parties hereto and an appropriate amendment or
supplement describing such information shall be filed with the SEC by the
Company and, to the extent required by applicable Law, disseminated to the
shareholders of the Company.

Section 6.5 _Access to Information_.

(a) Subject to applicable Laws, the Company shall, and shall cause each of its
Subsidiaries to, afford to Parent and its officers, employees,
accountants, counsel, agents and other Representatives reasonable access to
all of the properties, personnel, books and records of the Company and its
Subsidiaries (including Tax Returns filed and those in preparation, workpapers
and other items relating to Taxes) during normal business hours and upon
reasonable notice, and shall furnish all information concerning the business,
properties and personnel of the Company and its Subsidiaries as Parent may
reasonably request.

(b) All such information provided or received by Parent and its
Representatives shall be kept confidential in accordance with the terms of
the Confidentiality Agreement; _provided_ , _however_ , notwithstanding
anything contained in this Agreement or the Confidentiality Agreement to the
contrary, the parties (and each employee, representative, or other agent of
the parties) may disclose to any and all Persons, without limitation of any
kind, the tax treatment and any facts that may be relevant to the tax
structure of the Merger beginning on the date of this Agreement, _provided_ ,
_however_ , that no party (nor any Representative thereof) may disclose any
other information that is not relevant to understanding the tax treatment and
tax structure of the transaction (including the identity of any party and any
information that could lead another to determine the identity of any party),
or any other information to the extent that such disclosure could result in a
violation of any federal or state securities Law.

Section 6.6 _Reasonable Best Efforts_.

(a) Each of the parties hereto shall use reasonable best efforts to take, or
cause to be taken, all actions, and to do, or cause to be done, and to assist
and cooperate with the other parties in doing, all things necessary, proper or
advisable under applicable Laws and regulations to consummate and
make effective, in the most expeditious manner practicable, the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement as promptly as practicable including (i) the
preparation and filing of all forms, registrations and notices required to



 

44 be filed to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the
taking of such reasonable actions as are necessary to obtain any requisite
approvals, consents, Orders, exemptions or waivers by any third party or
Governmental Entity, including filings pursuant to the HSR Act and (ii) using
reasonable efforts to cause the satisfaction of all conditions to Closing.
Each party shall promptly consult with the other with respect to, provide any
necessary information with respect to and provide the other (or its counsel)
copies of, all filings made by such party with any Governmental Entity or any
other information supplied by such party to a Governmental Entity in
connection with this Agreement and the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement.

(b) For the avoidance of doubt and notwithstanding anything to the contrary
contained in this Agreement, nothing in this Agreement shall require or be
construed to require Parent to offer or agree to enter into any agreements,
including agreements to sell, license or otherwise dispose of, or hold
separate or otherwise divest itself of, waive any rights or agree to any
limitation on, all or any portion of the businesses or assets of Parent or any
of its Subsidiaries or of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries; _provided_
, _however_ , that Parent and its Subsidiaries (other than Lilly ICOS LLC)
shall commit to any and all divestitures, licenses, or hold separate or
similar arrangements with respect to the assets of the Company and its
Subsidiaries (other than Lilly ICOS LLC) that do not relate to the business or
operations of Lilly ICOS LLC as a condition to obtaining any and all approvals
from any Governmental Entity in order to consummate and make effective, as
promptly as practicable, but in no event later than the Termination Date, the
Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby. The Company shall agree
if, but solely if, requested by Parent to divest, hold separate or otherwise
take or commit to take any action with respect to the businesses, services, or
assets of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries in furtherance of this
Section 6.6(b); _provided_ , _however_ , that any such action may be
conditioned upon the consummation of the Merger.

(c) Each party hereto shall promptly inform the others of any communication
from any Governmental Entity regarding any of the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement. If any party or affiliate thereof receives a request for
additional information or documentary material from any such Governmental
Entity with respect to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, then
such party will endeavor in good faith to make, or cause to be made, as soon
as reasonably practicable and after consultation with the other party, an
appropriate response in compliance with such request.

Section 6.7 _State Anti-Takeover Statutes_. The Company and its Board of
Directors shall (i) take all reasonable action necessary to ensure that no
state anti-takeover statute or similar statute or regulation is or becomes
applicable to this Agreement, or the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement and (ii) if any state anti-takeover statute or similar statute
becomes applicable to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, take all reasonable action necessary to ensure that the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement may be consummated as promptly
as practicable on the terms contemplated by this Agreement and otherwise to
minimize the effect of such statute or regulation on this Agreement or the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement.



 

45 Section 6.8 _Indemnification; Insurance_.

(a) Parent agrees that, from and after the Effective Time, it will indemnify
and hold harmless each present and former director and officer of the
Company and member of the board of managers of Lilly ICOS LLC (when acting in
such capacity), determined as of the Effective Time (the " _Indemnified
Parties_ "), in respect of acts or omissions in their capacity as such,
against any costs or expenses (including reasonable attorneys fees),
judgments, fines, losses, claims, damages or liabilities incurred in
connection with any claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation, whether
civil, criminal, administrative or investigative, arising out of matters
existing or occurring at or prior to the Effective Time, whether asserted or
claimed prior to, at or after the Effective Time, to the fullest extent that
the Company would have been permitted under the WBCA and the Company Charter
Documents in effect on the date hereof to indemnify such Person (and Parent
shall also advance expenses as incurred to the fullest extent permitted under
applicable Law; _provided_ , that the Person to whom expenses are advanced
provides an undertaking to repay such advances if it is ultimately determined
by a court of competent jurisdiction that such Person is not entitled to
indemnification).

(b) Any Indemnified Party wishing to claim indemnification under Section
6.8(a), upon learning of any such claim, action, suit, proceeding
or investigation, shall promptly notify Parent thereof, but the failure to so
notify shall not relieve Parent of any obligation hereunder except to the
extent that Parent is actually prejudiced by such failure to give notice. In
the event of any such claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation
(whether arising before or after the Effective Time), (i) Parent or the
Surviving Corporation shall have the right to assume the defense thereof and
Parent shall not be liable to such Indemnified Parties for any legal expenses
of other counsel or any other expenses subsequently incurred by such
Indemnified Parties in connection with the defense thereof, except that if
Parent or the Surviving Corporation elects not to assume such defense
or counsel for the Indemnified Parties advises that there are issues which
raise conflicts of interest between Parent or the Surviving Corporation and
the Indemnified Parties, the Indemnified Parties may retain counsel
satisfactory to them, and Parent or the Surviving Corporation shall pay all
reasonable fees and expenses of such counsel for the Indemnified Parties
promptly as statements therefor are received; _provided_ , _however_ , that
Parent shall be obligated pursuant to this paragraph (b) to pay for only one
firm of counsel for all Indemnified Parties in any jurisdiction, (ii) the
Indemnified Parties will cooperate in the defense of any such matter and (iii)
Parent shall not be liable for any settlement effected without its prior
written consent; and _provided_ , _further_ , that Parent shall not have any
obligation hereunder to any Indemnified Party if and when a court of competent
jurisdiction shall ultimately determine, and such determination shall have
become final, that the indemnification of such Indemnified Party in the manner
contemplated hereby is prohibited by applicable Law.

(c) For six (6) years after the Effective Time, Parent shall cause the
Surviving Corporation to maintain (directly or indirectly through the
Companys existing



 

46 insurance programs) in effect the Companys current directors and officers
liability insurance (" _D andO Insurance_") in respect of acts or omissions
occurring at or prior to the Effective Time, covering each Person currently
covered by the Companys directors and officers liability insurance policy
(a complete and accurate copy of which has been heretofore delivered to
Parent), on terms with respect to such coverage and amounts no less favorable
than those of such policy in effect on the date hereof (provided that, such
terms are commercially available in the market); _provided_ , _however_ ,
that Parent may (i) substitute therefor policies of Parent containing terms
with respect to coverage (including as coverage relates to deductibles and
exclusions) and amount no less favorable to such directors and officers or
(ii) obtain such extended reporting period coverage under the Companys
existing DandO Insurance (to be effective as of the Effective Time) and the
Company shall cooperate with Parent in doing so (including, without
limitation, executing all documents and providing all information and
materials reasonably necessary therefor); _provided,_ _further,_ that, in
satisfying its obligation under this Section 6.8, neither the Company nor
Parent shall be obligated to pay on an annual basis more than 300% of the last
annual aggregate premium paid prior to the date of this Agreement by the
Company to obtain such coverage. It is understood and agreed that in the event
such coverage on an annual basis cannot be obtained for 300% of the last
annual aggregate premium paid prior to the date of this Agreement by the
Company or less, Parent shall be obligated to provide the greatest coverage as
may be obtained for such amount.

(d) If the Surviving Corporation or any of its successors or assigns (i) shall
consolidate with or merge into any other corporation or entity and shall not
be the continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation or
merger or (ii) shall transfer all or substantially all of its properties and
assets to any individual, corporation or other entity, then, and in each such
case, proper provisions shall be made so that the successors and assigns of
the Surviving Corporation shall assume all of the obligations set forth in
this Section 6.8 of the Surviving Corporation.

(e) The rights of each Indemnified Party under this Section 6.8 shall be in
addition to any right such Person might have under the Company
Charter Documents or the certificate of incorporation or by-laws of any of
the Companys Subsidiaries. The provisions of this Section 6.8 are intended to
be for the benefit of, and shall be enforceable by, each of the Indemnified
Parties, their heirs and their representatives.

Section 6.9 _Certain Litigation_. The Company agrees that it shall not settle
any litigation commenced after the date hereof against the Company or any of
its directors by any shareholder of the Company relating to the Merger or this
Agreement, without the prior written consent of Parent. In addition, the
Company shall not cooperate with any third party that may hereafter seek to
restrain or prohibit or otherwise oppose the Merger and shall cooperate with
Parent and Merger Sub to resist any such effort to restrain or prohibit or
otherwise oppose the Merger. Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing in this
Section 6.9 shall prohibit the Company from entering into settlement
negotiations with a third party for the purpose of settling litigation that
seeks to restrain or prohibit or otherwise oppose the Merger,
which settlement has the purpose of removing such litigation as an impediment
to the consummation of the transactions



 

47 contemplated by this Agreement; _provided_ , _however_ , that the Company
shall provide prior notice thereof to Parent and keep Parent fully informed
of the status and terms of any such discussions.

Section 6.10 _Notification of Certain Matters_. The Company shall give prompt
notice to Parent of (a) any notice or other communication from any third party
alleging that the consent of such third party is or may be required in
connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, (b) any
Company Material Adverse Effect or the occurrence of any event or events which
would be reasonably likely to have, individually or in the aggregate, a
Company Material Adverse Effect, or (c) the occurrence or existence of any
event that results, or with the passage of time or otherwise, is reasonably
likely to result, in the failure of the condition set forth in Section 7.2(a)
of this Agreement; _provided_ , _however_ , that the delivery of notice
pursuant to this Section 6.10 shall not limit or otherwise affect the remedies
available hereunder to Parent.

Section 6.11 _Tax Covenants_.

(a) The Company shall prepare and file or cause to be prepared and filed in a
manner consistent with past practice all Tax Returns (whether separate or
consolidated, combined, group or unitary Tax Returns that include the Company
or any of its Subsidiaries) that are required to be filed (with extensions) on
or before the Closing Date.

(b) All Contracts or intercompany account systems under which the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries may at any time have an obligation to indemnify for
or share the payment of or liability for any portion of a Tax (or any amount
calculated with reference to any portion of a Tax) shall be terminated with
respect to the Company and each such Subsidiary on or prior to the Closing
Date, and the Company and each such Subsidiary shall thereafter be released
from any liability thereunder.

(c) Except as required by applicable Law, without obtaining Parents prior
written consent, the Company shall not, and shall not permit any of its
Subsidiaries to, make, change or revoke any election in respect of Taxes, file
any amended Tax Return, adopt or change any accounting method or period in
respect of Taxes, enter into any material closing agreement, settle any
material claim or assessment in respect of Taxes, change any practice with
respect to Taxes, consent to any extension or waiver of any statute of
limitation applicable to any material claim or assessment in respect of Taxes
or offer or agree to do any of the foregoing or surrender its rights to do any
of the foregoing or to claim any refund in respect of Taxes.

(d) The Company shall furnish to Parent a certification in accordance with
Treas. Reg. § 1.1445-2(c), and otherwise in form and substance
reasonably satisfactory to Parent, certifying that an interest in the Company
is not a real property interest because the Company is not and has not been a
"United States real property holding corporation" (as defined in Section
897(c)(2) of the Code) during the applicable period specified in Section
897(c)(1)(A)(ii) of the Code.



 

48 Section 6.12 _Benefits and Other Employee Matters_.

(a) The Company shall terminate the employment of employees of the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries, effective immediately following the Effective
Time, who have been designated for termination by Parent prior to the
Effective Time. The Company agrees to notify any such employees of such
expected termination as soon as practicable after Parents notification to the
Company of such designated termination (but in no case later than three days
from such notification), whether or not Parents notification has provided the
Company with sufficient time to comply with all notice periods required by
applicable Law (including, without limitation the WARN Act). The Company
shall ensure that such notification complies with all provisions of applicable
Law (including, without, limitation, the WARN Act), except to the extent that
Parent has not notified the Company of the employees to be so terminated at
least 65 days in advance of the Effective Time. If Parent notifies the Company
of the employees to be so terminated less than 65 days in advance of the
Effective Time with respect to any employees entitled to notice under
the WARN Act or any state law, the Company shall give as much notice as
practicable, and Parent shall be responsible to provide pay and benefits in
lieu of any portion of the required notice period that was not provided prior
to the Effective Time. 

(b) The Company and Parent agree, in good faith, to develop a mutually
acceptable announcement to all employees affected by the transactions
contemplated by this agreement regarding the Merger and associated employment
matters. In addition, the Company and Parent agree, in good faith, to
establish a mutually acceptable protocol for meeting with the affected
employees to deliver such announcement. The Company will make no statements
to the Companys employees that are in any way materially inconsistent with
the terms of this Agreement.

(c) For a period of one year from and after the Effective Time, Parent shall
provide, or shall cause its Subsidiaries or the Surviving Corporation or
its Subsidiaries to provide, base wages, salary and benefits to the employees
of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries who continue to be employed by
Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any of their Subsidiaries after the
Effective Time (the " _Company Employees_ ") that are comparable in the
aggregate to the base wages, salary and benefits provided to the Company
Employees immediately prior to the Effective Time. The preceding sentence
shall not preclude Parent, Surviving Corporation or their Subsidiaries from
terminating the employment of any employee, subject to applicable severance
obligations.

(d) For purposes of determining eligibility to participate, vesting and
entitlement to benefits where length of service is relevant under any benefit
plan or arrangement of Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any of their
respective Subsidiaries providing benefits to any Company Employee after the
Effective Time (other than benefit accrual under defined benefit pension
plans) (collectively, the " _New Plans_ "), the Company Employees shall
receive service credit for service with the Company and its Subsidiaries (and
any respective predecessors) to the same extent such service credit was
granted under the Benefit Plans, except to the extent any such service credit
would result



 

49 in the duplication of benefits. In addition and without limiting the
generality of the foregoing: (i) each Company Employee shall be immediately
eligible to participate, without any waiting time or satisfaction of any other
eligibility requirements, in any and all New Plans to the extent that (A)
coverage under such New Plan replaces coverage under a Benefit Plan in which
such Company Employee participated immediately before the Effective Time
(collectively, the " _Old Plans_ ") and (B) such Company Employee has
satisfied all waiting time and other eligibility requirements under the Old
Plan being replaced by the New Plan; and (ii) for purposes of each New Plan,
Parent shall cause (X) all pre-existing condition exclusions and actively-at-
work requirements of such New Plan to be waived for such employee and his or
her covered dependents, and (Y) any expenses incurred by any Company Employee
and his or her covered dependents during the portion of the plan year of the
Old Plan ending on the date such employees participation in
the corresponding New Plan begins to be taken into account under such New
Plan for purposes of satisfying all deductible, coinsurance and maximum out-
of-pocket requirements applicable to such employee and his or her covered
dependents for the applicable plan year as if such amounts had been paid in
accordance with such New Plan. The provisions of this Section 6.12(d) shall in
no event apply to any employee of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries whose
employment has been terminated and who later is rehired by Parent, the
Surviving Corporation or any of their respective Subsidiaries.

(e) From and after the Effective Time, Parent shall, and shall cause the
Surviving Corporation to, assume and honor in accordance with their terms all
employment, severance and termination plans and agreements (including change
in control provisions) identified on Section 6.12(e) of the Company
Disclosure Schedule with employees of the Company and its Subsidiaries
provided such plans or agreements require by their terms that the Company
require any successor to all or substantially all of its assets or business to
expressly assume such plans or agreements.

(f) Each of the Parties agrees that the consummation of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement shall constitute a "change in control,"
"change of control" or "corporate transaction" or other event of a similar
nature for purposes of each plan, agreement, contract or arrangement
identified in Section 6.12(f) of the Company Disclosure Schedule and each of
the parties hereto and their respective Subsidiaries shall construe, interpret
and administer each such plan, agreement, contract or arrangement in a manner
consistent with such interpretation. 

(g) No provision of this Agreement shall create any third-party beneficiary
rights in any Company Employee, any beneficiary or dependent thereof, or any
collective bargaining representative thereof, with respect to the
compensation, terms and conditions of employment and/or benefits that may be
provided to any Company Employee by Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any
of their Subsidiaries under any benefit plan which they may maintain.

(h) The Company shall provide to Parent, prior to the Effective Time, a
list of employees the Company reasonably believes to be "specified employees"
(within the meaning of Section 409A(a)(2)(B)(i) of the Code) of the Company as
of the date of this Agreement.
