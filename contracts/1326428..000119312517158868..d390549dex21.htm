26 2.05 _Allocations and Adjustments._ If the Closing occurs:

 



   (a) | Buyer shall be entitled to all production and products from or
attributable to the Assets from and after the Effective Time and the proceeds

with respect to the Assets on or after the Effective Time, and shall be
responsible for (and entitled to any refunds with respect to) all Property
Costs attributable to the Assets and incurred from and after the Effective
Time. Seller shall be entitled to all production and products from or
attributable to the Assets prior to the Effective Time and the proceeds
thereof, and shall be responsible for (and entitled to any refunds with
respect to) all Property Costs attributable to the Assets and incurred prior
to the Effective Time. "Earned" and "incurred," as used in this Agreement,
shall be interpreted in accordance with generally accepted accounting
principles and Council of Petroleum Accountants Society (COPAS) standards. 
---|--- 



   (b) | Without limiting the allocation of costs and receipts set forth
in _Section 2.05(a)_ , for each Well operated by Seller or its Affiliate, (i)
Seller or its Affiliate shall retain overhead charges and rates received in
its capacity as "Operator" under any operating agreement or COPAS accounting
procedure attributable to such Well, and (ii) Seller or its Affiliate shall be
entitled to deduct and retain as overhead charges for any other Well operated
by Seller an amount per month equal to the product of (x) $600 and (y)
Sellers Working Interest in such Well. The charges and deductions under this
_Section 2.05(b)_ shall accrue from the Effective Time through the month in
which transfer of operations occurs; _provided however_ , that the overhead
charges for the month in which transfer of operations occurs shall be prorated
based upon the number of days in such month that Seller or its Affiliate
operated such Wells (and prorated for the number of days that the Well was in
drilling or completion, or was in production, as applicable). For purposes of
allocating revenues, production, proceeds, income, accounts receivable, and
products under this  _Section_ __ _ 2.05_, (A) liquid Hydrocarbons produced
into storage facilities will be deemed to be "from or attributable to" the
Wells when they pass through the pipeline connecting into the storage
facilities into which they are run, and (B) gaseous Hydrocarbons and liquid
Hydrocarbons produced into pipelines will be deemed to be "from or
attributable to" the Wells when they pass through the receipt point sales
meters on the pipelines through which they are transported. In order to
accomplish the foregoing allocation of production, the Parties shall rely upon
the gauging, metering, and strapping procedures which were conducted by Seller
on or about the Effective Time and, unless demonstrated to be inaccurate,
shall utilize reasonable interpolating procedures to arrive at an allocation
of production when exact gauging, metering, and strapping data is not
available on hand as of the Effective Time. Seller shall provide to Buyer
evidence of all meter readings and all gauging and strapping procedures
conducted on or about the Effective Time in connection with the Assets,
together with all data necessary to support any estimated allocation, for
purposes of establishing the adjustment to the Purchase Price pursuant to
_Section 2.05(c)_. 
---|--- 



   (c) | The Purchase Price shall be, without duplication, 
---|--- 
 



27 ---|---|--- 



     | (A) | the aggregate amount of (i) proceeds received by Buyer from
the sale of Hydrocarbons produced from and attributable to the Assets during
any period prior to the Effective Time to which Seller is entitled under 
_Section 2.05(a)_ (net of any (x) Royalties and (y) third party gathering,
processing, transportation and other similar midstream costs) and (ii) other
proceeds received by Buyer with respect to the Assets for which Seller would
otherwise be entitled under _Section 2.05(a)_;

January 1, 2017 and the Effective Time that are taken into account under
_Section 2.05(c)(i)(I)_ and _Section 2.05(c)(ii)(H)_ , the amount of
all Asset Taxes allocable to Buyer pursuant to _Section 13.02(c)_ but paid or
otherwise economically borne by Seller (excluding, for the avoidance of doubt,
any Asset Taxes that were withheld or deducted from the gross amount paid or
payable to Seller in connection with a transaction to which _Section
2.05(c)(ii)(A)_ applies, and therefore were taken into account in determining
the "proceeds received" by Seller for purposes of applying _Section
2.05(c)(ii)(A)_ with respect to such transaction); 
---|---|--- 



     | (C) | the aggregate amount of all non-reimbursed Property Costs
that have been paid by Seller that are attributable to the ownership and
operation of the Assets after the Effective Time (including the amount of any
prepayments of Property Costs made by Seller (or its immediate predecessor in
title) that are applied against operations conducted between the Effective
Time and Closing, but excluding all other prepayments);  
---|---|--- 



     | (D) | the amount of any prepayments of Property Costs made by
Seller (or its immediate predecessor in title) to Buyer or its Affiliates for
operations not completed prior to Closing and that are not reimbursed to
Seller on or prior to the Closing;

     | (E) | the amount of any other upward adjustment specifically
provided for in this Agreement or mutually agreed upon by the Parties; 
---|---|--- 



     | (F) | to the extent that proceeds for such volumes have not been
received by Seller, an amount equal to the value of all Hydrocarbons
attributable to the Assets in storage or existing in stock tanks, pipelines or
plants (including inventory) above the load line as of the Effective Time; 
---|---|--- 



     | (G) | the lesser of (x) the amount of all Specified Receivables
and (y) $50,000; 
---|---|--- 



     | (H) | if applicable, the amount, if any, of Imbalances in favor of
Seller, _multiplied by_ $2.29 per Mcf, or, to the extent that the applicable
Contracts provide for cash balancing, the actual cash balance
amount determined to be due to Seller as of the Effective Time; and 
---|---|--- 
 



28 $13,500,000 exceeds (2) the net income, proceeds, receipts, and credits earned
by Seller with respect to the Assets for the period from January 1, 2017 until
the Effective Time, _minus_ all Property Costs and Asset Taxes attributable
to the Assets during the period from January 1, 2017 until the Effective Time.

the sale of Hydrocarbons produced from and attributable to the Assets from and
after the Effective Time to which Buyer is entitled under _Section 2.05(a)_

received by Seller with respect to the Assets for which Buyer would otherwise
be entitled under _Section 2.05(a)_; 
---|---|--- 



     | (B) | the amount of all Asset Taxes allocable to Seller pursuant
to _Section 13.02(c)_ but paid or otherwise economically borne by Buyer
(excluding, for the avoidance of doubt, any Asset Taxes that were withheld
or deducted from the gross amount paid or payable to Buyer in connection with
a transaction to which _Section 2.05(c)(i)(A)_ applies, and therefore were
taken into account in determining the "proceeds received" by Buyer for
purposes of applying _Section 2.05(c)(i)(A)_ with respect to such
transaction); 
---|---|--- 



     | (C) | the aggregate amount of all downward adjustments pursuant to
_Article 11_ ; 
---|---|---

that are attributable to the ownership or operation of the Assets prior to the
Effective Time (excluding prepayments with respect to any period after the
Effective Time) and paid by Buyer; 
---|---|--- 



     | (E) | the amount of the Suspense Funds; 
---|---|--- 



     | (F) | the amount of any other downward adjustment specifically
provided for in this Agreement or mutually agreed upon by the Parties; 
---|---|--- 



     | (G) | if applicable, the amount, if any, of Imbalances owing by
Seller, _multiplied by_ $2.29 per Mcf, or, to the extent that the applicable
Contracts provide for cash balancing, the actual cash balance amount
determined to be owed by Seller as of the Effective Time; and 
---|---|--- 



     | (H) | if applicable, the positive amount by which (1) the net
income, proceeds, receipts, and credits earned by Seller with respect to the
Assets for the period from January 1, 2017 until the Effective Time,  _minus_
all Property Costs and Asset Taxes attributable to the Assets during the
period from January 1, 2017 until the Effective Time, exceeds (2) $13,500,000. 
---|---|--- 
 



29 No earlier than sixty (60) days following the Closing Date and no later than
ninety (90) days following the Closing Date, Seller shall prepare and submit
to Buyer a statement (the " _Final Settlement Statement_ ") setting forth each
adjustment or payment which was not finally determined as of the Closing Date
and showing the values used to determine such adjustments to reflect the
final adjusted Purchase Price based on actual credits, charges, receipts and
other items before and after the Effective Time. Buyer shall, at Sellers
request, supply all available documentation in Buyers or its Affiliates
possession in reasonable detail to permit Seller to determine any Purchase
Price adjustment under _Section 2.05(c)_ for Properties operated by Buyer or
its Affiliates. Seller shall, at Buyers request, supply available
documentation in reasonable detail to support any credit, charge, receipt or
other item, including all documentation used by Seller in the preparation of
such statement. On or before thirty (30) days after receipt of the
Final Settlement Statement, Buyer shall deliver to Seller a written report
containing any changes that Buyer proposes be made to the Final Settlement
Statement and an explanation of any such changes and the reasons therefor
together with any supporting information (the " _Dispute Notice_ "). During
such thirty (30)-day period, Buyer shall be given reasonable access to
Sellers and its Affiliates books and records relating to the matters
required to be accounted for in the Final Settlement Statement to allow Buyer
to conduct an audit and review of such items. Any changes not included in the
Dispute Notice shall be deemed waived. If Buyer fails to timely deliver a
Dispute Notice to Seller containing changes Buyer proposes to be made to the
Final Settlement Statement, the Final Settlement Statement as delivered by
Seller will be deemed to be mutually agreed upon by the Parties and will,
without limiting _Section 13.02(c)(iii)_ or Buyers right to indemnity under
_Section 10.02(c)_ for Seller Taxes, be final and binding on the Parties. Upon
delivery of the Dispute Notice, the Parties shall undertake to agree with
respect to any disputed amounts identified therein by the date that is one
hundred twenty (120) days after the Closing Date (the " _Post-Closing Date_
"). Except for Title Defect and Environmental Defect adjustments pursuant to
_Section 2.05(c)(ii)(C)_ , which shall be subject to the arbitration
provisions of _Section_ __ _ 11.15_, if the Parties are still unable to agree
regarding any item set forth in the Dispute Notice as of the Post-Closing
Date, then the Parties shall submit to a nationally-recognized independent
accounting firm mutually agreed upon by the Parties (the " _Accounting Expert_
") a written notice of such dispute along with reasonable supporting detail
for the position of Buyer and Seller, respectively, and the Accounting Expert
shall finally determine such disputed item in accordance with the terms of
this Agreement. The Accounting Expert shall act as an expert and not an
arbitrator. In determining the proper amount of any adjustment to the
Purchase Price related to the disputed item, the Accounting Expert shall not
increase the Purchase Price more than the increase proposed by Seller nor
decrease the Purchase Price more than the decrease proposed by Buyer, as
applicable. The decision of such Accounting Expert shall, without limiting
_Section 13.02(c)(iii)_ or Buyers right to indemnity under _Section
10.02(c)_ for Seller Taxes, be binding on the Parties, and the fees and
expenses of such Accounting Expert shall be borne one-half (1/2) by Seller
and one-half (1/2) by Buyer. The date upon which all adjustments and amounts
in the Final Settlement Statement are agreed to (or deemed agreed to) or
fully and finally determined by the Accounting Expert as set forth in this
_Section_ __ _ 2.05(d)_ shall be called the " _Final Settlement Date_ ," and
the final adjusted Purchase Price shall be called the " _Final Amount_." If
(a) the Final Amount 

---|--- 
 



30 an amount equal to the Final Amount, _minus_ the Preliminary Amount; or (b)
the Final Amount is less than the Preliminary Amount, Seller shall pay to
Buyer an amount equal to the Preliminary Amount, _minus_ the Final Amount.
Such payment shall be made within five (5) Business Days after the Final
Settlement Date by wire transfer of immediately available funds to the
accounts specified pursuant to wire instructions delivered in advance by
Seller or Buyer, as applicable. 
---|--- 

2.06  _Assumption._ If the Closing occurs, from and after the Closing Date,
Buyer shall assume, fulfill, perform, pay, and discharge the following
liabilities (except to the extent any such liabilities were Potential
Discharged Claims) arising from, based upon, related to, or associated with
the Assets and only to the extent not constituting Retained Liabilities
(collectively, the " _Assumed Liabilities_ ") subject to Sellers indemnity
obligations under  _Section_ __ _ 10.02_ (further subject to the limitations
and restrictions in _Article 10_ ): any and all Damages and obligations, known
or unknown, allocable to the Assets prior to, at, or after the Effective Time,

the adjustments to the Purchase Price made pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 2.03_,
_Section 2.05(c)_ or _Section 2.05(d)_ , as applicable, and (B) any payments
made from one Party to the other in respect of Asset Taxes pursuant to

_provided_ that, notwithstanding the foregoing, the Assumed Liabilities shall

and other materials from the Assets; _provided_  that, notwithstanding the
foregoing, the Assumed Liabilities shall not include any liabilities and
obligations for which Buyer is entitled to indemnification under _Section_ __
_ 10.02_. From and after the Closing, but effective as of the Effective
Time, subject to Sellers indemnity obligations under _Section_ __ _ 10.02_
(subject to the limitations and restrictions in _Article 10_ ), Buyer shall
assume, with respect to the Assets, all responsibility for any assessment,
remediation, removal, transportation, and disposal of these materials and
associated activities in accordance with all Legal Requirements.

 

2.07 _Allocation of Purchase Price._ The Purchase Price shall be allocated
among the Assets as set forth in _Schedule 2.07_  hereto. Seller and Buyer
agree to be bound by the Allocated Values set forth in _Schedule 2.07_ for
purposes of _Article 11_ hereof. Seller and Buyer shall use commercially
reasonable efforts to agree, for the purpose of making the requisite filings
under Section 1060 of the Code, and the regulations thereunder, to an
allocation of the Purchase Price and any items properly treated as
consideration for U.S. federal income Tax purposes among the Assets and, to
the extent allowed under applicable federal income Tax law, in a manner
consistent with the Allocated Values, as set forth on _Schedule 2.07_ (the "
_Tax Allocation_ "). If Seller and Buyer are unable to agree upon the Tax
Allocation, then the Tax Allocation shall be determined by the Accounting
Expert (the fees and expenses of whom shall be borne one-half (1/2) by Seller
and one-half (1/2) by Buyer)). Once the Tax Allocation is agreed by Seller
and Buyer or determined by the Accounting Expert, as applicable, Seller and
Buyer agree to report, and to cause their respective Affiliates to report the
information required by Section 1060(b) of the Code and to jointly prepare
Form 8594 (Asset Acquisition Statement under Section 1060 of the Code) as
promptly as possible following the Closing Date and in a manner consistent
with the Tax Allocation as revised to take into account subsequent
adjustments to the Purchase Price, including any adjustments pursuant to the
Agreement to determine the Final Amount, and shall not take any position
inconsistent therewith upon examination of any Tax Return, in any refund
claim, in any litigation, investigation or otherwise, unless required to do so
by any Legal Requirement after notice to the other Party, or with such other
Partys prior consent; _provided, however_ , that neither Party shall
be unreasonably impeded in its ability and discretion to negotiate,
compromise and/or settle any Tax audit, claim or similar proceedings in
connection with such allocation.

illegal, or otherwise interfering with, any of the Contemplated Transactions.
To Buyers Knowledge, no such Proceeding has been Threatened.

 

4.04 _Knowledgeable Investor._ Buyer is an experienced and knowledgeable
investor in the oil and gas business. Prior to entering into this Agreement,
Buyer was advised by its own legal, tax, and other professional counsel
concerning this Agreement, the Contemplated Transactions, the Assets, and
their value, and it has relied solely thereon and on the representations and
obligations of Seller in this Agreement and the documents to be executed by
Seller in connection with this Agreement at the Closing. Buyer is acquiring

deliver the amounts due at the Closing, (b) take such actions as may be
required to consummate the Contemplated Transactions, and (c) timely pay and
perform Buyers obligations under this Agreement and Buyers Closing
Documents. Buyer expressly acknowledges that the failure to have sufficient

hereunder, and in no event shall the Buyers failure to perform
its obligations hereunder be excused by failure to receive funds from any
source.

4.08 _Securities_ _ Laws_ _._ The solicitation of offers and the sale of the
Assets by Seller have not been registered under any securities laws. At no
time has Buyer been presented with or solicited by or through any public
promotion or any form of advertising in connection with the Contemplated
Transactions. Buyer is not acquiring the Assets with the intent of
distributing fractional, undivided interests that would be subject to
regulation by federal or state securities laws, and that if it sells,
transfers, or otherwise disposes of the Assets or fractional undivided
interests therein, it shall do so in compliance with applicable federal and
state securities laws.

 

4.09 _Due Diligence._ Without limiting or impairing any representation,

opportunity to ask all questions of Seller (or Sellers Representatives)
concerning the Assets, (c) been afforded the opportunity to investigate the
condition of the Assets, and (d) had the opportunity to take such other
actions and make such other independent investigations as Buyer deems
necessary to evaluate the Assets and understand the merits and risks of an
investment therein and to verify the truth, accuracy, and completeness of the
materials, documents, and other information provided or made available to
Buyer (whether by Seller or otherwise). WITHOUT LIMITING OR IMPAIRING ANY
REPRESENTATION, WARRANTY, COVENANT OR AGREEMENT OF THE SELLER
PARTIES CONTAINED IN THIS AGREEMENT AND THE SELLERS CLOSING DOCUMENTS
(INCLUDING THE SPECIAL WARRANTY OF DEFENSIBLE TITLE SET FORTH IN THE
INSTRUMENTS OF CONVEYANCE), OR BUYERS RIGHT TO RELY UPON EACH OF
THE FOREGOING OR BUYERS RIGHTS UNDER _A RTICLE 11_, BUYER HEREBY WAIVES ANY
CLAIMS ARISING OUT OF ANY MATERIALS, DOCUMENTS, OR OTHER INFORMATION PROVIDED
OR MADE AVAILABLE TO BUYER (WHETHER BY SELLER OR OTHERWISE), WHETHER UNDER
THIS AGREEMENT, AT COMMON LAW, BY STATUTE, OR OTHERWISE.

 

4.10 _Basis of Buyer_ __ _s Decision._ By reason of Buyers knowledge and
experience in the evaluation, acquisition, and operation of oil and gas
properties, Buyer has evaluated the

 



41  merits and the risks of purchasing the Assets from Seller and has formed an
opinion based solely on Buyers knowledge and experience, Buyers due
diligence, and Sellers representations, warranties, covenants, and
agreements contained in this Agreement and the Seller Closing Documents, and
not on any other representations or warranties by Seller. Buyer has not relied
and shall not rely on any statements by Seller or its Representatives (other
than those representations, warranties, covenants, and agreements of Seller
contained in this Agreement and the Seller Closing Documents) in making its
decision to enter into this Agreement or to close the
Contemplated Transactions. BUYER UNDERSTANDS AND ACKNOWLEDGES THAT NEITHER
THE UNITED STATES SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION NOR ANY OTHER
GOVERNMENTAL BODY HAS PASSED UPON THE ASSETS OR MADE ANY FINDING OR
DETERMINATION AS TO THE FAIRNESS OF AN INVESTMENT IN THE ASSETS OR THE
ACCURACY OR ADEQUACY OF THE DISCLOSURES MADE TO BUYER, AND, EXCEPT AS SET
FORTH IN  _A RTICLE 9_, BUYER IS NOT ENTITLED TO CANCEL, TERMINATE, OR
REVOKE THIS AGREEMENT, WHETHER DUE TO THE INABILITY OF BUYER TO
OBTAIN FINANCING OR PAY THE PURCHASE PRICE, OR OTHERWISE.

 

4.11 _Business Use, Bargaining Position._ Buyer is purchasing the Assets for
commercial or business use. Buyer has sufficient knowledge and experience in
financial and business matters that enables it to evaluate the merits and the
risks of transactions such as the Contemplated Transactions, and Buyer is not
in a significantly disparate bargaining position with Seller. Buyer expressly
acknowledges and recognizes that the price for which Seller has agreed to sell
the Assets and perform its obligations under the terms of this Agreement has
been predicated upon the inapplicability of the Texas Deceptive
Trade PracticesConsumer Protection Act, V.C.T.A. BUS and COMM ANN. § 17.41 et
seq. (the " _DTPA_ "), to the extent applicable, or any similar Legal
Requirement, and the waiver of the DTPA, and any similar Legal Requirement,
by Buyer contained in _Section_ __ _ 13.04_. BUYER FURTHER RECOGNIZES THAT
SELLER, IN DETERMINING TO PROCEED WITH ENTERING INTO THIS AGREEMENT, HAS
EXPRESSLY RELIED ON THE PROVISIONS OF THIS _A RTICLE 4_.

 

4.12 _Bankruptcy._ There are no bankruptcy, reorganization, receivership, or
arrangement proceedings pending or being contemplated by Buyer or, to Buyers
Knowledge, Threatened against Buyer. Buyer is, and will be immediately after
giving effect to the Contemplated Transactions, solvent.

Buyer acknowledges that Seller owns undivided interests in certain of the
properties comprising the Assets, and Buyer agrees that the acts or omissions
of the other working interest owners who are not Seller or an Affiliate of
Seller shall not constitute a Breach of the provisions of this _Section_ __ _
5.02_, nor shall any action required by a vote of working interest owners
constitute such a Breach so long as Seller and any Affiliate of Seller owning
an interest in the applicable Asset (or portion of the Assets) have voted its
interest in a manner that complies with the provisions of this _Section_ __ _
5.02_. Further, no action or inaction of any Third Party operator with respect
to any Asset shall constitute a Breach of this  _Section_ __ _ 5.02_ to the
extent Seller uses commercially reasonable efforts to cause such Third Party
operator to operate such applicable Asset in a manner consistent with this
_Section_ __ _ 5.02_. Seller may seek Buyers approval to perform any action
that would otherwise be restricted by this _Section_ __ _ 5.02_, and Buyers
approval of any such action shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned,
or delayed, and shall be considered granted ten (10) days after delivery of
notice from Seller to Buyer requesting such consent unless Buyer notifies
Seller to the contrary during such ten (10)-day period. Notwithstanding the
foregoing provisions of this _Section_ __ _ 5.02_, in the event of an
emergency involving imminent threat to property or life, Seller may take such
action as reasonably necessary and shall notify Buyer of such action promptly
thereafter. Any matter approved (or deemed approved) by Buyer pursuant to this
_Section_ __ _ 5.02_ that would otherwise constitute a Breach of one of
Sellers representations and warranties in _Article 3_ shall be deemed to be
an exclusion from all representations and warranties for which it is relevant.

5.03 _Insurance._  Seller shall maintain in force during the period from the
Execution Date until the Closing, insurance policies (including qualified
self-insurance) pertaining to the Assets with the minimum coverages as set
forth on _Schedule 5.03_. The daily pro-rated annual premiums for insurance
set forth on _Schedule 5.03_ that accrue after the Effective Time and are
attributable to the insurance coverage for the period after the Effective Time
until the Closing will constitute Property Costs to the extent attributable
to the Assets (but not to the extent attributable to any other assets of
Seller).

 

5.04 _Consent and Waivers._ Seller shall use commercially reasonable efforts
to obtain prior to the Closing written waivers of all Preferential Purchase
Rights and all Consents necessary for the transfer of the Assets to Buyer;
_provided_ that in the event Seller is unable to obtain all such waivers of
Preferential Purchase Rights and Consents after using such
commercially reasonable efforts, such failure to satisfy shall not constitute
a Breach of this Agreement. Seller shall not be required to make any payments
to, or undertake any obligations for the benefit of, the holders of such
rights in order to obtain the Required Consents. Buyer shall reasonably
cooperate with Seller in seeking to obtain such Consents.

 



45 5.05 _Amendment to Schedules_ _._ Until the fifth (5th) Business Day before
Closing, Seller shall have the right (but not the obligation) to supplement
its Schedules with respect to any matters that first occur following to the
Execution Date. Except to the extent such updates are a direct result of
actions taken with Buyers consent pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 5.02_, prior
to Closing, any such supplement shall not be considered for purposes of
determining if Buyers Closing conditions have been met under  _Section_ __ _
7.01_ or for determining any remedies available under this Agreement.

5.06 _Successor Operator._ While Buyer acknowledges that it desires to
succeed Seller (or its Affiliates) as operator of those Assets or portions
thereof that Seller (or its Affiliates) may presently operate, Buyer
acknowledges and agrees that Seller cannot and does not covenant or warrant
that Buyer shall become successor operator of such Assets because the Assets
or portions thereof may be subject to operating or other agreements that
control the appointment of a successor operator. Seller agrees, however, that
as to the Assets any Seller Party or its Affiliate operates, Seller shall use
commercially reasonable efforts to support Buyers efforts to become successor
operator of such Assets (to the extent permitted under any
applicable operating agreement) effective as of the Closing (at Buyers sole
cost and expense) and to designate or appoint, to the extent legally possible
and permitted under any applicable operating agreement, Buyer as successor
operator of such Assets effective as of Closing. Seller will use commercially
reasonable efforts to assist Buyer to obtain all necessary Permits in
connection with Buyers designation as operator as to the Assets Seller
presently operates as of Closing.

 

5.07 _Affiliate Contracts_. Seller will terminate or cause its respective
Affiliates to terminate, effective as of the Closing Date, any contracts or
agreements between Seller and its Affiliates insofar and only insofar as such
contracts or agreements relate to or bind the Assets.

 

5.08 _Drilling Permits_. During the period following the Execution Date until
the Closing, if reasonably requested by Buyer, Seller will execute and file
any applications or instruments prepared by Buyer that are necessary to obtain
drilling permits to be used with respect to the future development of the
Assets with the applicable Governmental Bodies; _provided_  that Buyer will
reimburse Seller for any reasonable, documented out-of-pocket costs incurred
in connection therewith and that such drilling permits will only be
on existing pads.

5.09 _Credit Transfer_. Promptly following Closing, Buyer shall deliver the
Emission Credits Transfer Letter to the State of Wyoming Department of
Environmental Quality. Following the Closing, Seller will use commercially
reasonable efforts (including assisting Buyer as reasonably requested by Buyer
with obtaining approval from the State of Wyoming Department of Environmental
Quality) to cause the Emission Reduction Credits to be transferred to Buyer as
soon as reasonably practicable following the Closing.

 

5.10 ___Stipulation and Agreed Order_. Prior to Closing, Seller (or its
applicable Affiliate or predecessor) shall cause the Stipulation and Agreed
Order to be amended or supplemented such that Exhibit 1 to the Stipulation and
Agreed Order properly and accurately reflects all of the federal Leases
(including the lots associated with such Leases) identified on  _Exhibit A_.

representation, warranty, covenant or agreement shall (if curable) be fully
cured by the Closing (or, if the Closing does not occur, prior to the

such Breach shall be considered not to have occurred for all purposes of this
Agreement.

pursuant to applicable Legal Requirements, cooperate with and use all
reasonable efforts to assist the other with respect to such filings,
applications and negotiations. Buyer shall bear the cost of all filing or
application fees payable to any Governmental Body with respect to the
Contemplated Transactions, regardless of whether Buyer, Seller, or any
Affiliate of any of them is required to make the payment.

6.05 _HSR Act._ If applicable, within ten (10) Business Days following the
execution by Buyer and Seller of this Agreement, Buyer and Seller will each
prepare and simultaneously file with the DOJ and the FTC the notification and

---|--- 
 



58 10.06 _Procedure for Indemnification_ __ _Third Party Claims._



   (a) | Promptly after receipt by an indemnified party under _Section_ __
_ 10.02_ or _10.03_ of a Third Party claim for Damages or notice of the
commencement of any Proceeding against it, such indemnified party shall, if a
claim is to be made against an indemnifying Party under such Section, give
notice to the indemnifying Party of the commencement of such claim or
Proceeding, together with a claim for indemnification pursuant to this 
_Article 10_. The failure of any indemnified party to give notice of a Third
Party claim or Proceeding as provided in this _Section_ __ _ 10.06_ shall not
relieve the indemnifying Party of its obligations under this _Article 10_
except to the extent such failure results in insufficient time being available
to permit the indemnifying Party to effectively defend against the Third Party
claim or participate in the Proceeding or otherwise prejudices the
indemnifying Partys ability to defend against the Third Party claim or
participate in the Proceeding. 
---|--- 



   (b) |

If any Proceeding referred to in _Section 10.06(a)_ is brought against an
indemnified party and the indemnified party gives notice to the indemnifying
Party of the commencement of such Proceeding, the indemnifying Party shall be
entitled to participate in such Proceeding and, to the extent that it wishes
(unless (i) the indemnifying Party is also a party to such Proceeding and the
indemnified party determines in good faith that joint representation would be
inappropriate, or (ii) the indemnifying Party fails to provide reasonable
assurance to the indemnified party of its financial capacity to defend such
Proceeding and provide indemnification with respect to such Proceeding), to
assume the defense of such Proceeding with counsel reasonably satisfactory to
the indemnified party, and, after notice from the indemnifying Party to the
indemnified party of the indemnifying Partys election to assume the defense
of such Proceeding, the indemnifying Party shall not, as long as it diligently
conducts such defense, be liable to the indemnified party under this
_Article 10_ for any fees of other counsel or any other expenses with respect
to the defense of such Proceeding, in each case subsequently incurred by the
indemnified party in connection with the defense of such Proceeding.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, the indemnifying
Party shall not be entitled to assume or continue control of the defense of
any such Proceeding if (A) such Proceeding relates to or arises in connection
with any criminal proceeding, (B) such Proceeding seeks an injunction or
equitable relief against any indemnified Party, (C), in the case of an
indemnification claim by Buyer pursuant to _Section 10.02(a)_ (other than with
respect to a Fundamental Representation) such Proceeding has or would
reasonably be expected to result in Damages in excess of the amount set forth
in _Section_ __ _ 10.05_ (i.e., twenty percent (20%) of the unadjusted
Purchase Price), or (D) the indemnifying Party has failed or is failing to
defend in good faith such Proceeding. If the indemnifying Party assumes the
defense of a Proceeding, no compromise or settlement of such Third Party
claims or Proceedings may be effected by the indemnifying Party without the
indemnified partys prior written consent unless (A) there is no finding or
admission of any violation of Legal Requirements or any violation of the
rights of any Person and no effect on any other Third Party claims that may be
made against the indemnified party, and (B) the sole relief provided is
monetary damages that are paid in full by the 

---|--- 
 



59 liability with respect to any compromise or settlement of such Third Party
claims or Proceedings effected without its consent.  
---|--- 

10.07 _Procedure for Indemnification  Other Claims._ A claim for
indemnification for any matter not involving a Third Party claim may be
asserted by notice to the Party from whom indemnification is sought.

10.08 _Indemnification of Group Members._ The indemnities in favor of Buyer
and Seller provided in _Section_ __ _ 10.08_ and _Section_ __ _ 10.03_,
respectively, shall be for the benefit of and extend to such Partys
present and former Group members. Any claim for indemnity under this _Article
10_ by any Group member other than Buyer or Seller must be brought and
administered by the relevant Party to this Agreement. No indemnified party
other than Buyer and Seller shall have any rights against either Seller or
Buyer under the terms of this _Article 10_ except as may be exercised on its
behalf by Buyer or Seller, as applicable, pursuant to this _Section_ __ _
10.08_. Each of Seller and Buyer may elect to exercise or not exercise
indemnification rights under this Section on behalf of the other indemnified
party affiliated with it in its sole discretion and shall have no liability to
any such other indemnified party for any action or inaction under this
Section.

10.09 _Extent of Representations and Warranties._ __

AGREEMENT, EXCEPT AS AND TO THE EXTENT EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS
AGREEMENT, THE CERTIFICATES DELIVERED BY SELLER AT CLOSING OR IN THE

REPRESENTATIVES BY ANY AFFILIATES OR REPRESENTATIVES OF SELLER OR BY ANY
INVESTMENT BANK OR INVESTMENT BANKING FIRM, ANY PETROLEUM ENGINEER OR

EXCEPT AS AND TO THE EXTENT EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, THE
CERTIFICATES DELIVERED BY SELLER AT CLOSING OR IN THE INSTRUMENTS OF
CONVEYANCE, SELLER EXPRESSLY DISCLAIMS AND NEGATES ANY REPRESENTATION OR
WARRANTY, EXPRESS, IMPLIED, AT COMMON LAW, BY STATUTE, OR OTHERWISE, RELATING
TO (A) THE TITLE TO ANY OF THE ASSETS, (B) THE CONDITION OF THE ASSETS
(INCLUDING ANY IMPLIED OR EXPRESS WARRANTY OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A
PARTICULAR PURPOSE, OR CONFORMITY TO MODELS OR SAMPLES OF MATERIALS), IT
BEING DISTINCTLY UNDERSTOOD THAT THE ASSETS ARE BEING SOLD "AS IS," "WHERE
IS," AND "WITH ALL FAULTS AS TO ALL MATTERS," (C) ANY INFRINGEMENT BY SELLER
OF ANY PATENT OR PROPRIETARY RIGHT OF ANY THIRD PARTY, (D) ANY INFORMATION,
DATA, OR OTHER MATERIALS (WRITTEN OR ORAL) FURNISHED TO BUYER BY OR ON BEHALF
OF SELLER (INCLUDING THE EXISTENCE OR EXTENT OF HYDROCARBONS OR THE MINERAL

ASSUMPTIONS, AND THE ABILITY TO SELL HYDROCARBON PRODUCTION AFTER THE
CLOSING), AND (E) THE ENVIRONMENTAL CONDITION AND OTHER CONDITION OF THE
ASSETS AND ANY POTENTIAL LIABILITY ARISING FROM OR RELATED TO THE ASSETS. 
---|--- 
 



60 Closing will make its own independent investigation, analysis, and evaluation
of the Contemplated Transactions and the Assets (including Buyers
own estimate and appraisal of the extent and value of Sellers Hydrocarbon
reserves attributable to the Assets and an independent assessment and
appraisal of the environmental risks associated with the acquisition of the
Assets). Buyer acknowledges that in entering into this Agreement, it has
relied on the aforementioned investigation and the express representations and
warranties of Seller contained in this Agreement and the Seller Closing
Documents. Buyer hereby irrevocably covenants to refrain from, directly or
indirectly, asserting any claim, or commencing, instituting, or causing to be
commenced, any Proceeding of any kind against Seller or its Affiliates,
alleging facts contrary to the foregoing acknowledgment and affirmation. 
---|--- 

10.10 _Compliance With Express Negligence Test_ _ _.__ THE PARTIES AGREE THAT
ANY INDEMNITY, DEFENSE, AND/OR RELEASE OBLIGATION ARISING UNDER THIS
AGREEMENT SHALL APPLY WITHOUT REGARD TO THE NEGLIGENCE, STRICT LIABILITY, OR
OTHER FAULT OF THE INDEMNIFIED PARTY, WHETHER ACTIVE, PASSIVE, JOINT,
CONCURRENT, COMPARATIVE, CONTRIBUTORY OR SOLE, OR ANY PRE-EXISTING CONDITION,
ANY BREACH OF CONTRACT OR BREACH OF WARRANTY, OR VIOLATION OF ANY LEGAL
REQUIREMENT, EXCEPT TO THE EXTENT SUCH DAMAGES WERE OCCASIONED BY THE GROSS
NEGLIGENCE OR WILLFUL MISCONDUCT OF THE INDEMNIFIED PARTY OR ANY GROUP MEMBER
THEREOF, IT BEING THE PARTIES INTENTION THAT DAMAGES TO THE EXTENT ARISING
FROM THE GROSS NEGLIGENCE OR WILLFUL MISCONDUCT OF THE INDEMNIFIED PARTY
OR ANY GROUP MEMBER THEREOF NOT BE COVERED BY THE RELEASE, DEFENSE,
OR INDEMNITY OBLIGATIONS IN THIS AGREEMENT. The foregoing is a specifically
bargained for allocation of risk among the Parties, which the Parties agree
and acknowledge satisfies the express negligence rule and conspicuousness
requirement under Texas law.

10.11  _Limitations of Liability._ Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
contained in this Agreement, IN NO EVENT SHALL SELLER OR BUYER EVER BE LIABLE
FOR, AND EACH PARTY RELEASES THE OTHER FROM, ANY CONSEQUENTIAL, SPECIAL,
INDIRECT, EXEMPLARY, OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES OR CLAIMS RELATING TO OR ARISING OUT
OF THE CONTEMPLATED TRANSACTIONS OR THIS AGREEMENT; _provided, however_ ,
that any consequential, special, indirect, exemplary, or punitive damages
recovered by a Third Party (including a Governmental Body, but excluding any
Affiliate of any Group member) against a Person entitled to indemnity
pursuant to this _Article 10_ shall be included in the Damages recoverable
under such indemnity. Notwithstanding the foregoing, lost profits shall not be
excluded by this provision as to recovery hereunder to the extent
constituting direct Damages.

10.12 _No Duplication._ Any liability for indemnification hereunder shall be
determined without duplication of recovery by reason of the state of facts
giving rise to such liability constituting a Breach of more than one
representation, warranty, covenant, obligation, or agreement herein. Neither
Buyer nor Seller shall be liable for indemnification with respect to any
Damages based on any sets of facts to the extent the Purchase Price is being
or has been adjusted pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 2.05_ by reason of the same
set of facts.

following the Closing, the payment of money, as limited by the terms of this
Agreement, shall be adequate compensation for Breach of any representation,

Seller and Buyer waive any right to rescind this Agreement or any of the
transactions contemplated hereby.

ARTICLE 11 

TITLE MATTERS AND ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS; PREFERENTIAL PURCHASE RIGHTS;
CONSENTS

 

11.01 _Title Examination and Access._ Buyer may make or cause to be made at
its expense such examination as it may desire of Sellers title to the
Assets. For such purposes, until the Closing, Seller shall give to Buyer and
its Representatives access during Sellers regular hours of business to
originals or copies (including electronic copies if available), of all of the
Records, files, records, contracts, correspondence, maps, data, reports,
plats, abstracts of title, lease files, well files, unit files, division order
files, production marketing files, title opinions, title files, title
records, ownership maps, surveys, and any other information, data, records,
and files that Seller or its Affiliates have relating in any way to the title
to the Assets, the past or present operation thereof, and the marketing of
production therefrom, in accordance with, and subject to the limitations in,
_Section_ __ _ 5.01_.

11.02 _Preferential Purchase Rights._



   (a) |

Seller shall, as promptly as practical but in no event later than ten (10)
Business Days after the Execution Date, provide all notices necessary to
comply with or obtain the waiver of all Preferential Purchase Rights which are
applicable to the Contemplated Transactions prior to the Closing Date and in
compliance with the contractual provisions applicable thereto. To the extent
any such Preferential Purchase Rights are properly exercised by any holders
thereof, then the Asset(s) subject to such Preferential Purchase Rights shall
not be sold to Buyer and shall be excluded from the Assets and sale under
this Agreement and shall be considered Retained Assets. The Purchase Price
shall be adjusted downward by the Allocated Value of the Asset(s) so retained.
On the Closing 

---|--- 
 



62 Purchase Right has not expired, but no notice of waiver (nor of the exercise
of such Preferential Purchase Right) has been received from the holder
thereof, then the Asset(s) subject to such Preferential Purchase Right shall
be included in the Closing, with no adjustment to the Purchase Price. After
the Closing, if the holder of such Preferential Purchase Right exercises
the Preferential Purchase Right, then Buyer shall convey the affected
Asset(s) to such party, and shall receive the consideration for such affected
Asset(s) directly from such party. If any holder of a Preferential Purchase
Right initially elects to exercise that Preferential Purchase Right, but
after the Closing Date, refuses to consummate the purchase of the affected
Asset(s), then, subject to the Parties respective rights and remedies as to
the obligation to consummate the Contemplated Transactions, Buyer shall
purchase such Asset(s) for the Allocated Value thereof (subject to the
adjustments pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 2.05_), and the closing of such
transaction shall take place on a date reasonably designated by Seller not
more than one hundred eighty (180) days after the Closing Date. If such
holders refusal to consummate the purchase of the affected Asset(s) occurs
prior to the Closing Date, then, subject to the Parties respective
rights and remedies as to the obligation to consummate the Contemplated
Transactions, Buyer shall purchase the affected Asset(s) at the Closing in
accordance with the terms of this Agreement. 
---|--- 
 



   (b) | Within three (3) Business Days following the request of either
Party, the Parties shall (i) amend this Agreement to exclude any Asset to the
extent subject to a Preferential Purchase Right that has not been waived or
disclaimed prior to the Execution Date (the " _Pref Right Properties_ ") and
to reduce the Purchase Price by the Allocated Values of such Pref Right
Properties and (ii) to enter into a separate purchase and sale
agreement covering the sale of such Pref Right Properties from Seller to
Buyer in exchange for the Allocated Values of such Pref Right Properties (the
" _Pref Right Purchase Agreement_ "). The Pref Right Purchase Agreement shall
be on substantially the same terms and conditions as this Agreement but for
such changes as are necessary to reflect the fact that the Pref Right Purchase
Agreement only covers the Pref Right Properties. In addition to the conditions
to Closing that will be set forth in Article 7 and Article 8 of the Pref
Right Purchase Agreement, the obligations of each of the Parties to close the
Pref Right Purchase Agreement shall be conditioned upon the Closing of this
Agreement. In the event the owner of the preferential purchase right waives
in writing its election to enter into the Pref Right Purchase Agreement, the
Pref Right Purchase Agreement will be deemed terminated and this Agreement
will be in full force and effect in the form of this Agreement as of the
Execution Date. 
---|--- 

11.03 _Consents._ Seller shall as promptly as practical, but in no
event later than ten (10) Business Days after the Execution Date, provide all
notices required to comply with or obtain all Consents in compliance with the
contractual provisions applicable thereto required for the transfer of the
Assets and in accordance with _Section_ __ _ 5.04_.



   (a) | If Seller fails to obtain any Consent necessary for the transfer
of any Asset to Buyer, Sellers failure shall be handled as follows: 
---|--- 
 



     | (i) | If the Consent is not a Required Consent and has not been
denied in writing, then the affected Assets shall nevertheless be conveyed at
the Closing as part of the Assets. Any Damages that arise due to the failure
to obtain such Consent shall be borne by Buyer. 
---|---|--- 
 



63 has been denied in writing, the Purchase Price shall be adjusted downward by
the Allocated Value of the affected Assets (which affected Assets shall
include all Leases and Wells affected by the Applicable Contract or Lease for
which a Consent is refused), and the affected Assets shall be treated as
Retained Assets. 
---|---|--- 



   (b) | Notwithstanding the provisions of _Section 11.03(a)_ , if Seller
obtains a Consent described in _Section 11.03(a)(ii)_ within one hundred
eighty (180) days after the Closing, then Seller shall promptly deliver
conveyances of the affected Asset(s) to Buyer and Buyer shall pay to Seller an
amount equal to the Allocated Value of the affected Asset(s) in accordance
with wire transfer instructions provided by Seller (subject to the adjustments
set forth in _Section_ __ _ 2.05)_. 
---|--- 

11.04 _Title Defects._ Buyer shall notify Seller of Title Defects (" _Title
Defect Notice(s)_ ") promptly after the discovery thereof, but in no event
later than 5:00 p.m. Central Time on May 26, 2017 (the " _Defect Notice Date_
"). To be effective, each Title Defect Notice shall be in writing and include
(a) a description of the alleged Title Defect and the Lease or Well or portion
thereof (including by the currently producing formation or Target Formation,
as applicable) affected by such alleged Title Defect (each, a " _Title Defect
Property_ "), (b) the Allocated Value of each Title Defect Property, (c)
supporting documents reasonably necessary for Seller to verify the existence
of the alleged Title Defect, and (d) the amount by which Buyer reasonably
believes the Allocated Value of each Title Defect Property is reduced by such
alleged Title Defect and the computations upon which Buyers belief is based
(the " _Title Defect Value_ "). To give Seller an opportunity to commence
reviewing and curing Title Defects, Buyer agrees to use reasonable efforts to
give Seller, on a weekly basis prior to the Defect Notice Date, written notice
of all alleged Title Defects (as well as any claims that would be claims
under the special warranty of Defensible Title set forth in the Instruments of
Conveyance) discovered by Buyer during the preceding week; _provided_ , that
the failure to provide any such preliminary notice shall not affect
Buyers right to assert Title Defects at any time prior to the Defect Notice
Date. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, subject to Buyers
rights under the Instruments of Conveyance, Buyer forever waives, and Seller
shall have no liability for, Title Defects not asserted by a Title Defect
Notice meeting substantially all of the requirements set forth in the
preceding sentence no later than 5:00 p.m. Central Time on the Defect Notice
Date.

 

11.05 _Title Defect Value._ The Title Defect Value shall be determined
pursuant to the following guidelines, where applicable: 



   (a) | if the Parties agree on the Title Defect Value, then that amount
shall be the Title Defect Value; 
---|--- 



   (b) | if the Title Defect is an Encumbrance that is undisputed and
liquidated in amount, then the Title Defect Value shall be the amount
necessary to be paid to remove the Title Defect from the Title Defect
Property;  
---|--- 
 



64 discrepancy between (i) Sellers Net Revenue Interest for the Title Defect
Property and (ii) the Net Revenue Interest set forth for such Title Defect
Property in _Schedule 2.07_ (and Sellers Working Interest in the Well is
decreased in the same or greater proportion), then the Title Defect Value
shall be the product of the Allocated Value of such Title Defect Property, 
_multiplied_ by a fraction, the numerator of which is the Net Revenue Interest
decrease and the denominator of which is the Net Revenue Interest set forth
for such Title Defect Property in _Schedule 2.07_ ; 
---|--- 
 



   (d) | if the Title Defect with respect to a Well represents an increase
of (i) Sellers Working Interest for any Title Defect Property over (ii) the
Working Interest set forth for such Title Defect Property in  _Schedule 2.07_
(except (A) increases resulting from contribution requirements with respect to
defaulting co-owners from and after the Execution Date under applicable
operating agreements, or (B) increases to the extent that such increases are
accompanied by a proportionate increase in Sellers Net Revenue Interest),
then the Title Defect Value shall be the product of the Allocated Value of
such Title Defect Property,  _multiplied_ by a fraction, the numerator of
which is the Working Interest increase and the denominator of which is the
Working Interest set forth for such Well in _Schedule 2.07_ ; 
---|--- 
 



   (e) | if the Title Defect with respect to a Lease results from a
discrepancy where (i) the actual Net Acres for such Title Defect Property as
to the Target Formation is less than (ii) the Net Acres set forth on 
_Schedule 2.07_ for such Title Defect Property, then the Title Defect value
shall be calculated by multiplying the Net Acre deficiency for such Lease by
the per-Net Acre Allocated Value; and  
---|--- 



   (f) | if the Title Defect represents an obligation or Encumbrance upon
or other defect in title to the Title Defect Property of a type not described
above, then the Title Defect Value shall be determined by taking into account
the Allocated Value of the Title Defect Property, the portion of the Title
Defect Property affected by the Title Defect, the legal effect of the Title
Defect, the potential economic effect of the Title Defect over the life of the
Title Defect Property, the values placed upon the Title Defect by Buyer and
Seller and such other reasonable factors as are necessary to make a proper
evaluation. 
---|--- 
 

In no event, however, shall the total of the Title Defect Values related to a
particular Asset exceed the Allocated Value of such Asset. The Title Defect
Value with respect to a Title Defect shall be determined without any
duplication of any costs or losses included in any other Title Defect Value
hereunder, or for which Buyer otherwise receives credit in the calculation of
the Purchase Price.

11.06 _Seller_ __ _s Cure or Contest of Title Defects._

 

Seller may contest any asserted Title Defect or Buyers good faith estimate of
the Title Defect Value as described in  _ 
Section_ __ _ 11.06(b)_ and may seek to cure any asserted Title Defect as
described in _Section_ __ _ 11.06(a)_.

 



65 before sixty (60) days after the Defect Notice Date (the " _Title Defect Cure
Period_ ") by giving written notice to Buyer of its election to cure prior to
the Closing Date. If Seller elects to cure and: 
---|--- 



     | (i) | actually cures the Title Defect (" _Cure_ "), prior to the
Closing, then the Asset affected by such Title Defect shall be conveyed to
Buyer at the Closing, and no Purchase Price adjustment will be made for such
Title Defect; or 
---|---|--- 



     | (ii) | does not cure the Title Defect prior to the Closing, then
Seller shall: 
---|---|--- 



     | (A) | if Seller elects to cure the Title Defect, convey the
affected Asset to Buyer and Buyer shall pay the Title Defect Value
attributable to the affected Asset to the Escrow Agent at the Closing;
_provided, however_  that if Seller is unable to Cure the Title Defect by the
end of the Title Defect Cure Period, then (i) Seller shall include a downward
adjustment in the Final Settlement Statement equal to the Title Defect Value
for such Asset and (ii) the Parties shall issue joint written instructions to
the Escrow Agent to release such Title Defect Value to Buyer; or 
---|---|--- 



     | (B) | if and only if Buyer agrees to this remedy in its sole
discretion, indemnify Buyer against all Damages (up to the Allocated Value of
the applicable Title Defect Property) resulting from such Title Defect with
respect to such Title Defect Property pursuant to an indemnity agreement
prepared by Seller in a form and substance reasonably acceptable to Buyer. 
---|---|--- 



     | (iii) | If Seller does not elect to cure the Title Defect, subject
to Sellers continuing right to dispute the Title Defect, Seller shall convey
the affected Asset to Buyer at the Closing and the Purchase Price shall
be adjusted in accordance with the terms of this Agreement. 
---|---|--- 



   (b) | Seller and Buyer shall attempt to agree on the existence and
Title Defect Value for all Title Defects. Representatives of the Parties,
knowledgeable in title matters, shall meet during the Title Defect Cure Period
for this purpose. However, either Party may at any time prior to the final
resolution of the applicable Title Defect hereunder submit any disputed Title
Defect or the Title Defect Value to arbitration in accordance with the
procedures set forth in  _Section_ __ _ 11.15_. If a contested Title Defect
cannot be resolved prior to Closing, except as otherwise provided herein, the
Asset affected by such Title Defect shall nevertheless be conveyed to Buyer at
the Closing, and the Purchase Price will be adjusted downward in an amount
equal to the Title Defect Value for such Asset; _provided, however_ , that if
the Title Defect Value as finally decided between the Parties or by the
Expert, as applicable, is less than the Title Defect Value used for the
Purchase Price adjustment, then Buyer shall include an upward adjustment in
the Final Settlement Statement equal to the amount that the Title Defect Value
(as of Closing) exceeds the Title Defect Value as finally determined. 
---|--- 

11.07 _Limitations on Adjustments for Title Defects._ Notwithstanding the
provisions of _Sections 11.04_ , _11.05_ and _11.06_ , other than with
respect to the special warranty of Defensible

 



66  Title to be provided in the Instruments of Conveyance, Seller shall be
obligated to adjust the Purchase Price to account for uncured Title Defects
only to the extent that the sum of (x) the aggregate Title Defect Values of
all uncured Title Defects (the " _Aggregate Title Defect Value_ ") (after
taking into account any offsetting Title Benefit Values) _plus_ (y) the
Aggregate Environmental Defect Value exceeds the Aggregate Defect Deductible.
In addition, if the Title Defect Value for any single Lease or Well is less
than the De Minimis Title Defect Cost (and the aggregate of all Title Defect
Values for all Title Defects based upon a single matter creating such Title
Defect is less than the De Minimis Title Defect Cost), such value shall not be
considered in calculating the Aggregate Title Defect Value.

 

11.08 _Title Benefit_ _s._ If Seller discovers any right, circumstance or
condition that operates (a) to increase the Net Revenue Interest in any Well
above that shown in _Schedule 2.07_ , to the extent the same does not cause a
greater than proportionate increase in Sellers Working Interest therein above
that shown in _Schedule 2.07_ , (b) to decrease the Working Interest of
Seller in any Well below that shown in _Schedule 2.07_ , to the extent the
same causes a decrease in Sellers Working Interest that is proportionately
greater than the decrease in Sellers Net Revenue Interest therein below that
shown in _Schedule 2.07_ , (d) to increase the Net Acres for a Lease as to the
applicable Target Formation to an amount greater than the Net Acres for such
Lease in _Schedule 2.07_ (each, a " _Title Benefit_ "), then Seller shall,
from time to time and without limitation, have the right, but not the
obligation, to give Buyer written notice of any such Title Benefits (a "
_Title Benefit Notice_ "), as soon as practicable but not later than 5:00
p.m. Central Time on the Defect Notice Date, stating with reasonable
specificity the Assets affected (the " _Title Benefit Properties_ "), the
particular Title Benefit claimed, and Sellers good faith estimate of the
amount the additional interest increases the value of the affected Assets over
and above that Assets Allocated Value (the " _Title Benefit Value_ "). Buyer
shall also promptly furnish Seller with written notice of any Title Benefit
(including a description of such Title Benefit and the Assets affected thereby
with reasonable specificity which is discovered by any of Buyer or any of its
Affiliates Representatives, employees, title attorneys, landmen, or other
title examiners. The Title Benefit Value of any Title Benefit shall be
determined by the following methodology, terms and conditions (without
duplication): (i) if the Parties agree on the Title Benefit Value, then that
amount shall be the Title Benefit Value; (ii) if the Title Benefit represents
a discrepancy between (A) Sellers Net Revenue Interest for any Well and (B)
the Net Revenue Interest set forth for such Title Benefit Property in 
_Schedule 2.07_ then the Title Benefit Value shall be the product of the
Allocated Value of such Title Benefit Property _multiplied_ by a fraction, the
numerator of which is the Net Revenue Interest increase and the denominator
of which is the Net Revenue Interest set forth for such Title Benefit
Property in _Schedule 2.07_ ; (iii) if the Title Benefit represents a decrease
of (A) Sellers Working Interest for any Title Benefit Property below (B)
the Working Interest set forth for such Title Benefit Property in _Schedule
2.07_, then the Title Benefit Value shall be the product of the Allocated
Value of such Title Benefit Property, _multiplied_ by a fraction, the
numerator of which is the Working Interest decrease and the denominator of
which is the Working Interest set forth for such Title Benefit Property in
_Schedule 2.07_; (iv) if the Title Benefit represents an increase in Net
Acres of a Lease set forth in  _Schedule 2.07_, then the Title Benefit
Amount shall be determined by multiplying the Net Acre increase with respect
to such Lease by the per-Net Acre Allocated Value; and (v) if the
Title Benefit is of a type not described above, then the Title Benefit Value
shall be determined by taking into account the Allocated Value of the Title
Benefit Property, the portion of such Title Benefit Property affected by such
Title Benefit, the legal effect of the Title Benefit, the potential

 



67  economic effect of the Title Benefit over the life of such Title Benefit
Property, the values placed upon the Title Benefit by Buyer and Seller and
such other reasonable factors as are necessary to make a proper evaluation.

Seller and Buyer shall attempt to agree on the existence and Title Benefit
Value for all Title Benefits on before the end of the Title Defect Cure
Period. If Buyer agrees with the existence of the Title Benefit and Sellers
good faith estimate of the Title Benefit Value, then the Aggregate Title
Defect Value shall be offset by the amount of the Title Benefit Value. If the
Parties cannot reach agreement by the end of the Title Defect Cure Period, the
Title Benefit or the Title Benefit Value in dispute shall be submitted to
arbitration in accordance with the procedures set forth in  _Section_ __ _
11.15_. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Parties agree and acknowledge that
there shall be no upward adjustment to the Purchase Price for any Title
Benefit. If a contested Title Benefit cannot be resolved prior to the
Closing, Seller shall convey the affected Asset to Buyer and Buyer shall pay
for the Asset at the Closing in accordance with this Agreement as though there
were no Title Benefits; _provided, however_ , if the Title Benefit contest
results in a determination that a Title Benefit exists, then the Aggregate
Title Defect Value shall be adjusted downward by the Title Benefit Value as
determined in such contest (which adjustment shall be made on the Final
Settlement Statement).

 

11.09 _Buyer_ __ _s Environmental Assessment._ Beginning on the Execution
Date and ending at 5:00 p.m. Central Time on the Defect Notice Date, Buyer
shall have the right, at its sole cost, risk, liability, and expense, to
conduct a Phase I Environmental Site Assessment of the Assets. During Sellers
regular hours of business and after providing Seller with written notice of
any such activities no less than two (2) Business Days in advance (which
written notice shall include the written permission of the operator (if other
than Seller) and any applicable Third Party operator or other Third Party
whose permission is legally required, which Seller shall reasonably cooperate
with Buyer in securing), Buyer and its representatives shall be permitted to
enter upon the Assets, inspect the same, review all of Sellers files
and records (other than those for which Seller has an attorney-client
privilege) relating to the Assets, and generally conduct visual, non-invasive
tests, examinations, and investigations. No sampling or other invasive
inspections of the Assets may be conducted prior to Closing without Sellers
prior written consent. Buyers access shall be in accordance with, and subject
to the limitations in, _Section_ __ _ 5.01_. Notwithstanding anything in
this Agreement to the contrary, if (a) Buyer is not granted access to any
Asset to conduct its Phase I Environmental Site Assessment of the Assets or
(b) Buyer determines in good faith that (based on the results of its Phase I
Environmental Site Assessment) sampling or testing of environmental media or
operation of equipment is recommended on an Asset and Buyer is not granted
permission and access to conduct such activities, then Buyer may elect to
exclude such Asset, together with all associated Assets, and reduce the
Purchase Price by the Allocated Value of such Assets (which will become
Retained Assets).

 

11.10 _Environmental Defect Notice._ Buyer shall notify Seller in writing of
any Environmental Defect (an " _Environmental Defect Notice_ ") promptly
after the discovery thereof, but in no event later than 5:00 p.m. Central Time
on the Defect Notice Date. To be effective, an Environmental Defect Notice
shall include: (i) the Lease(s) or Well(s) affected; (ii) a reasonably
detailed description of the alleged Environmental Defect and the basis for
such assertion under the terms of this Agreement; (iii) Buyers good faith
estimate of the Environmental Defect Value 

 



68  with respect to such Environmental Defect; and (iv) appropriate
documentation reasonably necessary for Seller to substantiate Buyers claim
and calculation of the Environmental Defect Value. Notwithstanding anything
herein to the contrary, subject to _Section_ __ _ 11.13_, Buyer forever
waives Environmental Defects not asserted by an Environmental Defect Notice
meeting substantially all of the requirements set forth in the preceding
sentence no later than 5:00 p.m. Central Time on the Defect Notice Date.

11.11  _Seller_ __ _s Exclusion, Cure or Contest of Environmental Defects._
Seller, in its sole discretion, (x) may elect to exclude at Closing any Asset
(which will become a Retained Asset) affected by an asserted Environmental
Defect if the Environmental Defect Value with respect to such Environmental
Defect equals or exceeds the Allocated Value of the affected Asset(s) and
reduce the Purchase Price by the Allocated Value(s) thereof, (y) may contest
any asserted Environmental Defect or Buyers good faith estimate of the
Environmental Defect Value as described in _Section 11.11(b)_ and/or (z) may
seek to remediate or cure any asserted Environmental Defect to the extent
of the Lowest Cost Response as described in _Section 11.11(a)_ ; _provided_ ,
if the Environmental Defect Value agreed upon by the Parties or finally
determined in accordance with _Section_ __ _ 11.15_ is equal to or
exceeds the Allocated Value of the affected Assets, then Buyer may elect to
exclude such affected Assets, together with all associated Assets, and reduce
the Purchase Price by the Allocated Value of such Assets (which will become
Retained Assets) ( _provided_ that if such agreement or final determination
occurs following the Closing, then Buyer shall reassign such affected Assets
to Seller pursuant to an assignment in form and substance reasonably
acceptable to the Parties in exchange for the Allocated Value of such
Assets).



   (a) | Seller shall have the right to remediate or cure an Environmental
Defect to the extent of the Lowest Cost Response on or before the Closing Date
by giving written notice to Buyer to that effect prior to the Closing Date.
If Seller elects to pursue remediation or cure as set forth in this clause
(a), Seller shall implement such remediation or cure in a manner that is in
compliance with all applicable Legal Requirements in a prompt and timely
fashion for the type of remediation or cure. If Seller elects to pursue
remediation or cure and: 
---|--- 



     | (i) | completes a Complete Remediation of an Environmental Defect
prior to the Closing Date, the affected Lease(s) or Well(s) shall be included
in the Assets conveyed at Closing, and no Purchase Price adjustment will be
made for such Environmental Defect; 
---|---|--- 



     | (ii) | does not complete a Complete Remediation prior to the
Closing Date, unless Seller or Buyer elects to exclude such Asset(s) in
accordance with this _Section_ __ _ 11.11_, then Seller shall convey
the affected Asset(s) to Buyer and the Purchase Price shall be reduced by the
Environmental Defect Value of the affected Asset(s). 
---|---|--- 



   (b) |

Seller and Buyer shall attempt to agree on the existence and Environmental
Defect Value of all Environmental Defects. Representatives of the Parties,
knowledgeable in environmental matters, shall meet for this purpose. However,
a Party may at any time prior to the final resolution of the applicable
Environmental Defect hereunder elect to  

---|--- 
 



69 procedures set forth in _Section_ __ _ 11.15_. If a contested Environmental
Defect cannot be resolved prior to the Closing, subject to the terms of this
_Section_ __ _ 11.11_ the affected Lease(s) or Well(s) (together with any
other Assets appurtenant thereto) shall be included with the Assets conveyed
to Buyer at Closing and the Purchase Price shall be reduced by the estimated
Environmental Defect Value set forth in the Environmental Defect Notice for
such contested Environmental Defect, and the final determination of the
Environmental Defect and/or Environmental Defect Value shall be resolved
pursuance to _Section_ __ _ 11.15_. 
---|--- 

11.12 _Limitations_ _._ Notwithstanding the provisions of _Sections 11.10_
and _11.11_ , no adjustment to the Purchase Price for Environmental Defect
Values shall be made unless and until the sum of (x) the aggregate value of
all Environmental Defect Values (the " _Aggregate Environmental Defect Value_
") _plus_ (y) the Aggregate Title Defect Value (after taking into account any
offsetting Title Benefit Values) exceeds the Aggregate Defect Deductible. If
the Environmental Defect Value with respect to any single Environmental
Defect is less than the De Minimis Environmental Defect Cost, such cost shall
not be considered in calculating the Aggregate Environmental Defect Value.

 

11.13 _Exclusive Remedies._ The rights and remedies granted to Buyer in this
Agreement are the exclusive rights and remedies against Seller related to any
Environmental Condition, or Damages related thereto. EXCEPT AS SET FORTH IN
THIS AGREEMENT, BUYER EXPRESSLY WAIVES, AND RELEASES SELLER GROUP FROM, ANY
AND ALL OTHER RIGHTS AND REMEDIES IT MAY HAVE UNDER ENVIRONMENTAL LAWS
AGAINST SELLER REGARDING ENVIRONMENTAL CONDITIONS, WHETHER FOR CONTRIBUTION,
INDEMNITY, OR OTHERWISE. The foregoing is a specifically bargained for
allocation of risk among the Parties, which the Parties agree and acknowledge
satisfies the express negligence rule and conspicuousness requirement under
Texas law.

 

11.14 _Casualty Loss and Condemnation._ If, after the Execution Date but prior
to Closing Date, any portion of the Assets is destroyed or damaged by fire or
other casualty or is expropriated or taken in condemnation or under right of
eminent domain (a " _Casualty Loss_ "), subject to _Section_ __ _ 7.08_ and 
_Section_ __ _ 8.08_, this Agreement shall remain in full force and effect,
and Buyer shall nevertheless be required to close the Contemplated
Transactions. In the event that the amount of the costs and expenses
associated with repairing or restoring the Assets affected by such Casualty
Loss exceeds Five Hundred Thousand Dollars ($500,000) net to Sellers
interest, (a) Seller must elect by written notice to Buyer prior to Closing
either to (x) cause the Assets affected by such Casualty Loss to be repaired
or restored, at Sellers sole cost prior to the Closing Date, or (y) reduce
the Purchase Price by the amount of the Casualty Loss and (b) Seller shall
retain all rights to insurance and other claims against Third Parties with
respect to the applicable Casualty Loss except to the extent the Parties
otherwise agree in writing. With respect to all other Casualty Losses, Seller
shall assign and subrogate to Buyer all rights to insurance and other claims
with respect to such Casualty Losses.

11.15 _Expert Proceedings._ __

 



   (a) |

Each matter referred to this _Section_ __ _ 11.15_ (a " _Disputed Matter_ ")
shall be conducted in accordance with the Commercial Arbitration Rules of the
AAA as supplemented to the 

---|--- 
 



70 by the Federal Arbitration Act (Title 9 of the United States Code), but only
to the extent that such rules do not conflict with the terms of this
_Section_ __ _ 11.15_. Any notice from one Party to the other referring a
dispute to this _Section_ __ _ 11.15_ shall be referred to herein as an "
_Expert Proceeding Notice_ ".  
---|--- 



   (b) | The arbitration shall be held before a one member arbitration
panel (the " _Expert_ "), mutually agreed by the Parties. The Expert must (a)
be a neutral party who has never been an officer, director or employee of or
performed material work for a Party or any Partys Affiliate within the
preceding five (5)-year period and (b) agree in writing to keep strictly
confidential the specifics and existence of the dispute as well as
all proprietary records of the Parties reviewed by the Expert in the process
of resolving such dispute. The Expert must have not less than fifteen (15)
years experience as a lawyer in the State of Wyoming with experience in
exploration and production issues. If disputes exist with respect to both
title and environmental matters, the Parties may mutually agree to conduct
separate arbitration proceedings with the title disputes and environmental
disputes being submitted to separate Experts. If, within five (5) Business
Days after delivery of an Expert Proceeding Notice, the Parties cannot
mutually agree on an Expert, then within seven (7) Business Days after
delivery of such Expert Proceeding Notice, each Party shall provide the other
with a list of three (3) acceptable, qualified experts, and within ten (10)
Business Days after delivery of such Expert Proceeding Notice, the Parties
shall each separately rank from one through six in order of preference each
proposed expert on the combined lists, with a rank of one being the most
preferred expert and the rank of six being the least preferred expert, and
provide their respective rankings to the Dallas office of the AAA. Based on
those rankings, the AAA will appoint the expert with the combined lowest
numerical ranking to serve as the Expert for the Disputed Matters. If the
rankings result in a tie or the AAA is otherwise unable to determine an Expert
using the Parties rankings, the AAA will appoint an arbitrator from one of
the Parties lists as soon as practicable upon receiving the Parties
rankings. Each Party will be responsible for paying one-half (1/2) of the fees
charged by the AAA for the services provided in connection with this _Section
11.15(b)_. 
---|--- 



   (c) | Within five (5) Business Days following the receipt by either
Party of the Expert Proceeding Notice, the Parties will exchange their written
description of the proposed resolution of the Disputed Matters. Provided that
no resolution has been reached, within five (5) Business Days following the
selection of the Expert, the Parties shall submit to the Expert the following:
(i) this Agreement, with specific reference to this  _Section_ __ _ 11.15_
and the other applicable provisions of this _Article 11_ , (ii) Buyers
written description of the proposed resolution of the Disputed Matters,
together with any relevant supporting materials, (iii) Sellers written
description of the proposed resolution of the Disputed Matters, together with
any relevant supporting materials, and (iv) the Expert Proceeding Notice. 
---|--- 
 



   (d) |

The Expert shall make its determination by written decision within fifteen
(15) days following receipt of the materials described in _Section 11.15(c)_
above (the " _Expert Decision_ "). The Expert Decision with respect to the
Disputed Matters shall be limited to the selection of the single proposal for
the resolution of the aggregate Disputed Matters 

---|--- 
 



71 of this Agreement, _i.e._ , the Expert must select either Buyers proposal or
Sellers proposal for resolution of the aggregate Disputed Matters. 
---|--- 



   (e) | The Expert Decision shall be final and binding upon the Parties,
without right of appeal, absent manifest error. In making its determination,
the Expert shall be bound by the rules set forth in this _Article 11_. The
Expert may consult with and engage disinterested Third Parties to advise the
Expert, but shall disclose to the Parties the identities of such consultants.
Any such consultant shall not have worked as an employee or consultant for
either Party or its Affiliates during the five (5)-year period preceding the
arbitration nor have any financial interest in the dispute. 
---|--- 



   (f) | The Expert shall act as an expert for the limited purpose of
determining the specific matters submitted for resolution herein and shall not
be empowered to award damages, interest, or penalties to either Party
with respect to any matter. Each Party shall bear its own legal fees and
other costs of preparing and presenting its case. All costs and expenses of
the Expert shall be borne by the non-prevailing Party in any such arbitration
proceeding.

ARTICLE 12

 

EMPLOYMENT MATTERS

 

12.01 _Seller Benefit Plans_. Effective as of his or her Employee Start Date,
each Continuing Employee shall cease to accrue further benefits and shall
cease to be an active participant under the Seller Benefit Plans. Buyer shall
not assume any of the Seller Benefit Plans. From and after each Continuing
Employees Employee Start Date, Seller and its ERISA Affiliates shall retain
and shall be solely responsible for all obligations and liabilities under the
Seller Benefit Plans, and neither Buyer nor its Affiliates shall have any
obligation, liability or responsibility from and after such
Continuing Employees Employee Start Date to or under the Seller Benefit
Plans, whether such obligation, liability or responsibility arose before, on
or after such Continuing Employees Employee Start Date.

 

12.02 _Pre-Employee Start Date Claims under Seller Benefit Plans and Accrued
Vacation Balances_.

(a) To the extent that an Available Employee was a participant in a Seller
Benefit Plan, the Seller Benefit Plans shall be responsible for providing
welfare benefits (including medical, hospital, dental, accidental death and
dismemberment, life, disability and other similar benefits) to any
participating Available Employees for all claims incurred prior to his or
her Employee Start Date under and subject to the terms and conditions of such
plans. For purposes of this _Section_ __ _ 12.02_, a claim is incurred with
respect to (i) accidental death and dismemberment, disability, life and other
similar benefits when the event giving rise to such claim occurred and (ii)
medical, hospital, dental and other similar benefits when the services with
respect to such claim are rendered; _provided_ , that all services related to
a continuous period of hospitalization shall be deemed to be rendered upon
the commencement of such period.

 



72 (b) Seller shall pay each Continuing Employees accrued and unused vacation
balance (the " _Accrued Vacation Balances_ "), in each case, to the extent
such Accrued Vacation Balance existed immediately prior to such Continuing
Employees Employee Start Date, in accordance with applicable Legal
Requirements.

 

12.03 _Available Employees  Offers and Post-Employee Start Date Employment
and Benefits_.

 

(a) Following the Execution Date, Seller shall provide Buyer reasonable access
to the Available Employees.

 

(b) Within two (2) Business Days of the Execution Date, Seller will provide
Buyer with a list that sets forth the name of each Available Employee, and
for each such individual, his or her name, job title, annualized salary or
hourly wage, bonus eligibility/target, long-term incentive eligibility/target,
vacation eligibility, hire date/start date, leave status (including
expected duration of any leave), and details of any visa (the " _Available
Employee List_ "), which Available Employee List shall (i) be consistent with
the employee schedules provided to Buyer prior to the Execution Date and (ii)
not include more than 32 individuals.

(c) Beginning seven (7) Business Days following the Execution Date, Buyer or
its Affiliate may make written offers of employment to each of the Available
Employees to whom Buyer or its Affiliate elects to make an offer of
employment, with such offers providing for an Employee Start Date of the
Closing Date. Each offer of employment shall provide the applicable Available
Employee at least five (5) Business Days to either accept or reject such
offer. No later than the date that is three (3) Business Days prior to the
anticipated Closing Date, Buyer shall notify Seller as to each Available
Employee who has accepted an offer from Buyer or any of its Affiliates, which
acceptance shall be conditioned upon the occurrence of the Closing and
effective as of the Employee Start Date and may be conditioned on other
typical hiring policies, and each Available Employee who has rejected Buyers
or its Affiliates offer of employment. Buyer shall indemnify and hold
harmless Seller and its Affiliates with respect to all claims and Liabilities
relating to or arising out of Buyers or its Affiliates employee selection
and employment offer process described in this _Section_ __ _ 12.03_
(including any claim of discrimination or other illegality in such selection
and offer process).

(d) Each Available Employee who is actively at work as of the Closing Date or
is on a previously scheduled and approved (by Seller or its Affiliates)
short-term disability, long-term disability, workers compensation or other
approved leave of absence and accepts an offer of employment from Buyer or its
Affiliate and, in each instance, assumes employment with Buyer or its
Affiliate is referred to as a " _Continuing Employee_." The date that a
Continuing Employee begins employment with Buyer or its Affiliate is referred
to as his or her " _Employee Start Date._ " During the twelve (12) month
period immediately following the Closing Date that a Continuing Employee is
employed by Buyer or its Affiliate, such Continuing Employee will be provided,
(i) base salary or hourly wage rate at least equal to the base salary
or hourly wage rate provided to the Available Employee as of the Execution
Date; (ii) reemployment or hiring opportunities, as applicable, to those
Available Employees (if any) identified in the Available Employee List as "
_Inactive Available Employees_ " ( _provided_ that, Seller shall have the
right until Closing to amend the Available Employee List to designate any
Available Employee as an

 



73  Inactive Available Employee if such employee becomes an Inactive Available
Employee following delivery of the Available Employee List) who are not
actively at work as of the Closing Date due to short-term disability,
workers compensation or other approved leave of absence, with such
reemployment or hiring to be effective as of the date, if any, each such
Inactive Available Employee has been cleared for and returns to
active employment and to be in a position comparable to that which such
Inactive Available Employee has prior to the commencement of his or her
absence from active employment (so long as such date occurs within 120 days
following the Closing Date or such longer time as may be required by any
applicable Legal Requirement); and (iii) cash severance benefit opportunities
for each Continuing Employee who is terminated or is subject to a reduction in
base pay or relocation of more than fifty (50) miles during the twelve (12)
month period immediately following the Employee Start Date as provided in (and
subject to release of claim requirements in favor of Buyer and its Affiliates
comparable to those within) the Severance Plan;  _provided_ that nothing in
the foregoing shall affect the right of Buyer or its Affiliates to terminate
the employment of a Continuing Employee for any reason or at any time. Seller
retains the right to terminate the employment of a Continuing Employee for
any reason or at any time prior to the Employee Start Date. On or before the
Employee Start Date of each Continuing Employee, Seller shall take all
necessary action to fully vest as of such date such Continuing Employees
account balances and other benefits under all Seller Benefit Plans, if any,
that (x) are employee pension benefit plans (as such term is defined in
Section 3(2) of ERISA) or (y) provide equity-based awards.

 

(e) Buyer or its Affiliate shall cause each Continuing Employee and his or her
eligible dependents (including all such employees dependents covered
immediately prior to the Employee Start Date by a group health plan maintained
by Seller or its Affiliates) to be eligible to be covered under a group health
plan maintained by Buyer or its Affiliate that (i) provides medical and
dental benefits coverage to such Continuing Employee and such eligible
dependents effective as of the first day of the calendar month following such
Continuing Employees Employee Start Date (unless such Continuing Employees
Employee Start Date is the first day of a calendar month, in which case, such
coverage shall be effective immediately as of such Continuing Employees
Employee Start Date) and (ii) credits such Continuing Employee, for the year
during which such coverage under such group health plan begins, for any
deductibles incurred during such year under a group health plan maintained by
Seller or its Affiliates.

 

(f) Buyer or its Affiliate shall recognize full service credit for all
purposes (other than (i) to the extent that such credit would result in
duplication of benefits with respect to the same period of service, (ii)
credit for any equity or incentive compensation plan or arrangement maintained
by Buyer or its Affiliates, (iii) for benefit accrual purposes under
any defined benefit pension plan) under all vacation, employee benefit plans,
policies and arrangements made available to Continuing Employees by Buyer or
any of its Affiliates on or after his or her Employee Start Date to the same
extent such Continuing Employees service was recognized under the
corresponding type of benefit plans in which such Continuing Employee
participated immediately prior to his or her Employee Start Date, including
the severance benefit determinations as set forth in the Severance Plan.

12.04 _Savings Plans_. Effective as of the Closing Date, Buyer shall, or shall
cause one of its Affiliates to, establish or maintain defined contribution
pension plan (or plans) and trust (or trusts) intended to qualify under
Sections 401(a) and 501(a) of the Code in which all Continuing

 



74  Employees shall be eligible to participate (the " _Buyer Savings Plan_ ") as
of their respective Employee Start Dates. Buyer or one of its Affiliates shall
cause the Buyer Savings Plan to accept the direct rollover of electing
Continuing Employees benefits in cash from any tax-qualified defined
contribution plans maintained by any Seller Party or their respective
Affiliates (each, a " _Seller Savings Plan_ "); provided that such direct
rollover consists of the full balance (rather than a portion of the balance)
of such account. Prior to the Closing Date, Seller shall take such actions, if
any, as may be necessary to permit the continuation of loan repayments after
such date by each Continuing Employee if he or she has an outstanding loan
from any Seller Savings Plan. Such loan repayments shall be made directly by
the Continuing Employee to the applicable Seller Savings Plan and shall be
permitted so long as the Continuing Employee remains employed by Buyer or any
of its Affiliates.

12.05  _Post-Employee Start Date Employment Claims_. Buyer shall indemnify,
defend and hold Seller and its Affiliates harmless from and against any and
all liability of any kind or nature involving or related to the employment of
each Continuing Employee by Buyer or its Affiliate after his or her Employee
Start Date, including any liability related to any employee benefit plan
sponsored or maintained by Buyer or its ERISA Affiliates after the Employee
Start Date. Seller shall indemnify, defend and hold Buyer and its Affiliates
harmless from and against any and all liability of any kind or nature or
related to (a) the employment of any Available Employee who does not become a
Continuing Employee, including any liability related to any Seller Benefit
Plan and (b) the employment of the Continuing Employees by Seller or its
Affiliate before his or her Employee Start Date, including any liability
related to any employee benefit plan sponsored or maintained by any Seller
Party or any of their respective ERISA Affiliates before the Employee Start
Date. Any Available Employee who rejects Buyers or its Affiliates offer of
employment in _Section_ __ _ 12.03_ will not be eligible for severance under
Sellers Severance Plan.

12.06 _Buyer Welfare Plans_. Buyer shall cause the waiver of all limitations
as to pre-existing conditions, exclusions and waiting periods with respect to
participation and coverage requirements applicable to the Continuing
Employees. Buyer shall provide continuation health care coverage to
Continuing Employees and their qualified beneficiaries who incur a qualifying
event, in accordance with the continuation health care coverage requirements
of Section 4980B of the Code and Title I, Subtitle B, Part 6 of ERISA ("
_COBRA_ ") or any similar provisions of state Legal Requirement, on or after
the Employee Start Date.

 

12.07 _WARN Act_. From the date of this Agreement until the final Employee
Start Date, Seller shall not and shall cause its Affiliates not to, terminate
the employment of any Available Employees such that a "plant closing" or "mass
layoff" (as those terms are defined in the WARN Act or any similar state Legal
Requirement) occurs prior to the final Employee Start Date without complying
with the WARN Act. Buyer agrees to provide any notice to each Continuing
Employee required under the WARN Act or any similar state Legal Requirement
with respect to any "plant closing" or "mass layoff" affecting such
Continuing Employee that may occur on or after his or her Employee Start Date.

12.08 _No Third Party Beneficiary Rights_. Nothing herein, expressed or
implied, shall confer upon any Available Employees (or any of their
beneficiaries or alternate payees) any rights or remedies (including any right
to employment or continued employment, or any right to

 



75  compensation or benefits for any period) of any nature or kind whatsoever,
under or by reason of this Agreement or otherwise. In addition, the provisions
of this _Article 12_ , are for the sole benefit of the Parties and are not
for the benefit of any Third Party. Nothing in this _Article 12_ , express or
implied, shall be (a) deemed an amendment of any Seller Benefit Plan providing
benefits to any Available Employee, or (b) construed to prevent Buyer or its
Affiliates from terminating or modifying to any extent or in any respect any
employee benefit plan that Buyer or its Affiliates may establish or maintain.

 

12.09 _Severance Obligation_. If any Available Employee is entitled to
severance benefits under the Sellers Severance Plan as a result of a
Qualifying Termination caused by the failure of Buyer or its Affiliate to give
an offer of employment to such Available Employee or the failure of Buyer to
give an offer of employment to the Available Employee that would avoid
a Qualifying Termination, Buyer will reimburse Seller for fifty percent (50%)
of the amount of severance benefits paid to such Available Employee pursuant
to Sellers Severance Plan, which payment shall be made within thirty (30)
days following Buyers receipt of a written invoice from Seller detailing the
applicable severance benefits paid, which invoice (or invoices) shall be
provided by Seller to Buyer within fifteen (15) days after the date that
Seller or its Affiliate has paid to the applicable Available Employee(s) the
severance benefits that are subject to the reimbursement described in this
_Section_ __ _ 12.09_. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Buyer will be obligated
to provide such reimbursement only if an Available Employees Qualifying
Termination occurs within thirty (30) days of the Closing Date.

 

ARTICLE 13

(b) originals (or copies where no original exists) of all other Records to

so that Seller may make copies of such original Records, at its own expense,
as may be reasonable or necessary for Tax purposes or in connection with any
Proceeding or Threatened Proceeding against Seller.

 

13.02 _Expenses and Taxes._



   (a) |

_Expenses_. Except as otherwise expressly provided in this Agreement, each
Party to this Agreement shall bear its respective expenses incurred in
connection with the preparation, execution, and performance of this Agreement

representatives, counsel, and accountants. However, the prevailing Party in
any Proceeding brought under or to enforce this 

---|--- 
 



76 _Section_ __ _ 11.15_ or _Section 2.05(d)_ , shall be entitled to recover

---|--- 



     | (i) | The Parties acknowledge and agree that no Transfer Taxes
will become due as a result of, or in connection with, the transfer of the
Assets pursuant to this Agreement, and neither Party shall take any
position inconsistent therewith unless required to do so by any applicable
Legal Requirement; _provided_ , _however_ , that if any Transfer Taxes are
asserted by any taxing authority in connection with the transfer of the Assets
pursuant to this Agreement, (A) Buyer shall, at Sellers expense, cooperate
with Seller in any Proceedings related to such Transfer Taxes and (B) to the
extent any such Transfer Taxes are determined to be due, Seller shall pay to
the appropriate taxing authority, or promptly reimburse Buyer for, any such
Transfer Taxes. 
---|---|--- 



     | (ii) | Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the preceding
clause (i), any and all required documentary, filing and recording fees and
expenses in connection with the filing and recording of the assignments,
conveyances or other Instruments of Conveyance required to convey title to
the Assets to Buyer shall be borne by Buyer. 
---|---|--- 



   (c) | _Asset Taxes_. 
---|--- 



     | (i) | Seller shall be allocated and bear all Asset Taxes
attributable to (A) any Tax period ending prior to January 1, 2017, and (B)
the portion of any Straddle Period ending immediately prior to January 1,
2017. Buyer shall be allocated and bear all Asset Taxes attributable to (x)
any Tax period beginning on or after January 1, 2017, and (y) the portion of
any Straddle Period beginning on January 1, 2017.  
---|---|--- 



     | (ii) |

For purposes of determining the allocations described in _Section 13.02(c)(i)_
, (A) Asset Taxes that are attributable to the severance or production of
Hydrocarbons (other than such Asset Taxes described in clause (C), below)
shall be allocated to the period in which the severance or production giving
rise to such Asset Taxes occurred, (B) Asset Taxes that are based upon or
related to sales or receipts or imposed on a transactional basis (other than
such Asset Taxes described in clause (A) or (C)), shall be allocated to the
period in which the transaction giving rise to such Asset Taxes occurred, and
(C) Asset Taxes that are ad valorem, property or other Asset Taxes imposed on
a periodic basis pertaining to a Straddle Period shall be allocated between
the portion of such Straddle Period ending immediately prior to January 1,
2017 and the portion of such Straddle Period beginning on January 1, 2017 by
prorating each such Asset Tax based on the number of days in the applicable
Straddle Period that occur before January 1, 2017, on the one hand, and the
number of days in such Straddle Period that occur on or after January 1, 2017,
on the other hand. Notwithstanding anything in this _Section 13.02(c)(ii)_ to

Gross Products Taxes based on the value of production of Hydrocarbons that
occurs prior to January 1, 2017, shall be allocated entirely to Seller and (y)
Gross Products Taxes based on the value of 2017 production of Hydrocarbons and
payable in 2018 and 2019 (" _2017 Gross Products Taxes_ ") shall be allocated
entirely to Buyer. 
---|--- 



     | (iii) | To the extent the actual amount of an Asset Tax is not
known at the time an adjustment is to be made with respect to such Asset Tax
pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 2.03_, _Section 2.05(c)_ or  _Section 2.05(d)_ ,
as applicable, the Parties shall utilize the most recent information available
in estimating the amount of such Asset Tax for purposes of such adjustment. To
the extent the actual amount of an Asset Tax (or the amount thereof paid or
economically borne by a Party) is ultimately determined to be different than
the amount (if any) that was taken into account in the Final Settlement
Statement as finally determined pursuant to _Section 2.05(d)_ , timely
payments will be made from one Party to the other to the extent necessary to
cause each Party to bear the amount of such Asset Tax that is allocable to
such Party under this _Section 13.02(c)_. 
---|---|--- 
 



   (d) | _Tax Returns and Payments_. Except as required by applicable
Legal Requirements or as otherwise provided in the Transition Services
Agreement:

Asset Taxes described in clause (A)) that are ad valorem or property Taxes
imposed on a periodic basis relating to any Tax period that ends before or
includes the Effective Time, and (C) all other Asset Taxes required to be
paid on or prior to the Closing Date, and Seller shall file with the
appropriate Governmental Body any and all Tax Returns required to be filed

applicable, (A) all Asset Taxes that are based on production of Hydrocarbons
occurring from June 1, 2017 through December 31, 2017 (including, for the
avoidance of doubt, all 2017 Gross Products Taxes attributable to production
that occurs from June 1, 2017 through December 31, 2017) and (B) all other
Asset Taxes relating to any Tax period that ends before or includes the
Effective Time 

---|---|--- 
 



78 each case, to the extent such Taxes are required to be paid, withheld or
remitted by Seller in accordance with _Section 13.02(d)(i)_ ), and Buyer
shall file with the appropriate Governmental Body any and all Tax Returns
required to be filed with respect to such Asset Taxes. 
---|--- 



     | (iii) | The Parties agree that (x) this _Section 13.02(d)_ is
intended to solely address the timing and manner in which certain Tax Returns
relating to Asset Taxes are filed and the Asset Taxes shown thereon are

furnished to the other, upon request, as promptly as practicable, such
information and assistance relating to the Assets, including access to
books and records, as is reasonably necessary for the filing of all Tax
Returns by Buyer or Seller, the making of any election relating to Taxes, the
preparation for any audit by any taxing authority and the prosecution or
defense of any claim, suit or proceeding relating to any Tax. The Parties
agree to retain all books and records with respect to Tax matters pertinent to
the Assets relating to any Tax period beginning before the Closing Date until
sixty (60) days after the expiration of the statute of limitations of the
respective Tax periods (taking into account any extensions thereof) and to
abide by all record retention agreements entered into with any taxing
authority

Asset Taxes allocated to Seller pursuant to _Section 13.02(c)_ , and Buyer

which the other Party is entitled pursuant to this _Section 13.02(f)_ , the
first Party shall promptly pay such amount to the other Party, net of

mail with receipt acknowledged, with the receiving Party affirmatively
obligated to promptly acknowledge receipt, or (d) when received by the

IN SUCH COURTS DESCRIBED ABOVE HAVING SITES IN HOUSTON, TEXAS AND EACH
PARTY IRREVOCABLY SUBMITS TO THE JURISDICTION OF SUCH COURTS SOLELY IN
RESPECT OF ANY PROCEEDING ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO THIS AGREEMENT. EACH

EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LEGAL REQUIREMENTS, ANY RIGHT IT MAY HAVE TO A
TRIAL BY JURY IN RESPECT OF ANY ACTION, SUIT OR PROCEEDING ARISING OUT OF OR
RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT, ANY TRANSACTION DOCUMENTS OR ANY TRANSACTION
CONTEMPLATED HEREBY OR THEREBY. THE PARTIES FURTHER AGREE, TO THE EXTENT
PERMITTED BY LAW, THAT A FINAL AND NONAPPEALABLE JUDGMENT AGAINST A PARTY IN

THAT A PARTY OR ANY OF ITS AFFILIATES HAS ACQUIRED, OR HEREAFTER MAY ACQUIRE,
ANY IMMUNITY FROM JURISDICTION OF ANY COURT OR FROM ANY LEGAL PROCESS

   (b) |

Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, each of the Parties agrees
that it will not bring or support any action, cause of action, claim, cross-
claim or third-Person claim of any kind or description, whether in law or in
equity, whether in contract or in tort or otherwise, against the Financing
Sources in any way relating to this Agreement or the Contemplated
Transaction, including any Proceeding arising out of or relating in any way to

81 courts, the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York
(and appellate courts thereof). Each of the Parties irrevocably agrees to
waive trial by jury in any action, cause of action, claim, cross-claim or
third-Person claim referred to in this paragraph. 
---|--- 
 

13.05 _Further Assurances._ Each Party agrees (a) to furnish upon request to
each other such further information, (b) to execute, acknowledge, and deliver
to each other such other documents, and (c) to do such other acts and things,
all as the other Party may reasonably request for the purpose of carrying out
the intent of this Agreement and the documents referred to in this Agreement.

13.06 _Waiver._ The rights and remedies of the Parties are cumulative and not
alternative. Neither the failure nor any delay by either Party in exercising
any right, power, or privilege under this Agreement or the documents referred
to in this Agreement shall operate as a waiver of such right, power, or
privilege, and no single or partial exercise of any such right, power, or
privilege shall preclude any other or further exercise of such right, power,
or privilege or the exercise of any other right, power, or privilege. To the
maximum extent permitted by applicable Legal Requirement, (a) no claim or
right arising out of this Agreement or the documents referred to in this
Agreement can be discharged by one Party, in whole or in part, by a waiver or
renunciation of the claim or right unless in writing signed by the
other Party, (b) no waiver that may be given by a Party shall be applicable
except in the specific instance for which it is given, and (c) no notice to or
demand on one Party shall be deemed to be a waiver of any obligation of such
Party or of the right of the Party giving such notice or demand to take
further action without notice or demand as provided in this Agreement or the
documents referred to in this Agreement.

 

13.07 _Entire Agreement and Modification._ This Agreement supersedes all prior
discussions, communications, and agreements (whether oral or written) between
the Parties with respect to its subject matter and constitutes (along with the
documents referred to in this Agreement) a complete and exclusive statement of
the terms of the agreement between the Parties with respect to its subject
matter. This Agreement may not be amended or otherwise modified except by a
written agreement executed by both Parties. No representation, promise,
inducement, or statement of intention with respect to the subject matter
of this Agreement has been made by either Party that is not embodied in this
Agreement together with the documents, instruments, and writings that are
delivered pursuant hereto, and neither Party shall be bound by or liable for
any alleged representation, promise, inducement, or statement of intention
not so set forth. In the event of a conflict between the terms and provisions
of this Agreement and the terms and provisions of any Schedule or Exhibit
hereto, the terms and provisions of this Agreement shall govern, control, and
prevail.

13.08 _Assignments, Successors, and No Third Party Rights._ Neither Party may
assign any of its rights, liabilities, covenants, or obligations under this
Agreement without the prior written consent of the other Party (which consent
may be granted or denied at the sole discretion of the other Party); provided
that Buyer (without the consent of Seller) may assign all or part of its
rights under this Agreement (including its rights to receive the Assets) to
one or more Affiliates (or to the Financing Sources for collateral purposes),
and (a) any assignment (other than an assignment by Buyer to an Affiliate)
made without such consent shall be void, and (b) in the event of such consent
(or an assignment by Buyer to an Affiliate), such assignment nevertheless
shall not relieve such assigning Party of any of its obligations under this
Agreement

 



82  without the prior written consent of the other Party. Subject to the
preceding sentence, this Agreement shall apply to, be binding in all respects
upon, and inure to the benefit of the successors and permitted assigns of the
Parties. Nothing expressed or referred to in this Agreement or any other
agreement contemplated herein shall be construed to give any Person other than
the Parties and their permitted assignees (and Buyer Group and Seller Group
who are entitled to indemnification under _Article 10_ ), any legal or
equitable right, remedy, or claim under or with respect to this Agreement or
any provision of this Agreement. Subject to the preceding sentence, this
Agreement, any other agreement contemplated herein, and all provisions and
conditions hereof and thereof, are for the sole and exclusive benefit of the
Parties and such other agreements (and Buyer Group and Seller Group who are
entitled to indemnification under _Article 10_ ), and their respective
successors and permitted assigns. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Financing
Sources shall be deemed third-Person beneficiaries of _Sections 9.02_ ,
_Section 13.04(b)_ , this  _Section_ __ _ 13.08_, and _13.18_ hereof, each
of which shall be enforceable by each Financing Source and, to the extent
enforced thereby, construed in accordance with, and governed by, the Laws of
the State of New York without reference to the conflict of laws principles
thereof, and none of which shall be amended or otherwise modified in any way
that adversely affects the rights of any Financing Source without the prior
written consent of the Financing Sources. 

13.09 _Severability._ If any provision of this Agreement is held invalid or
unenforceable by any court of competent jurisdiction, the other provisions of
this Agreement shall remain in full force and effect. Any provision of this
Agreement held invalid or unenforceable only in part or degree shall remain in
full force and effect to the extent not held invalid or unenforceable.

13.10 _Article and Section Headings, Construction._ The headings of Sections,
Articles, Exhibits, and Schedules in this Agreement are provided for
convenience only and shall not affect its construction or interpretation. All
references to "Section," "Article," "Exhibit," or "Schedule" refer to
the corresponding Section, Article, Exhibit, or Schedule of this Agreement.
Unless expressly provided to the contrary, the words "hereunder," "hereof,"
"herein," and words of similar import are references to this Agreement as a
whole and not any particular Section, Article, Exhibit, Schedule, or other
provision of this Agreement. Each definition of a defined term herein shall be
equally applicable both to the singular and the plural forms of the term so
defined. All words used in this Agreement shall be construed to be of such
gender or number, as the circumstances require. Unless otherwise expressly
provided, the word "including" does not limit the preceding words or terms and
(in its various forms) means including without limitation. If the date
specified in this Agreement for giving any notice or taking any action is not
a Business Day (or if the period during which any notice is required to be
given or any action taken expires on a date which is not a Business Day),
then the date for giving such notice or taking such action (or the expiration
date of such period during which notice is required to be given or action
taken) shall be the next day which is a Business Day. Each Party has had
substantial input into the drafting and preparation of this Agreement and has
had the opportunity to exercise business discretion in relation to the
negotiation of the details of the Contemplated Transactions. This Agreement is
the result of arms-length negotiations from equal bargaining positions. This
Agreement shall not be construed against either Party, and no consideration
shall be given or presumption made on the basis of who drafted this Agreement
or any particular provision hereof or who supplied the form of Agreement.

 



83 13.11 _Counterparts._ This Agreement may be executed and delivered (including
by facsimile or e-mail transmission) in one or more counterparts, each of
which shall be deemed to be an original copy of this Agreement and all of
which, when taken together, shall be deemed to constitute one and the same
agreement.

13.12 _Press Release._ No Party shall make any press release or other public
announcement respecting this Agreement or the Contemplated Transactions prior
to the time that is twenty-four (24) hours following the execution and
delivery of this Agreement by the Parties. Subject to _Section_ __ _ 13.13_,
if, prior to Closing, any Party wishes to make a press release or other
public announcement respecting this Agreement or the Contemplated
Transactions, such Party will provide the others with a draft of the press
release or other public announcement for review at least twenty-four (24)
hours prior to the time that such press release or other public announcement
is to be made. The Parties will attempt in good faith to expeditiously reach
agreement on such press release or other public announcement and the contents
thereof; provided that failure to reach such agreement shall not prohibit a
Party from making a press release or public announcement. Failure to provide
comments back to the other Party within twenty-four (24) hours of receipt of
the draft release or announcement will be deemed consent to the public
disclosure of such press release or other public announcement and the content
thereof. Seller and Buyer shall each be liable for the compliance of their
respective Affiliates with the terms of this _Section_ __ _ 13.12_.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this _Section_ __ _ 13.12_, no
Party shall issue a press release or other public announcement that includes
the name of a non-releasing Party or its Affiliates without the prior written
consent of such non-releasing Party (which consent may be withheld in
such non-releasing Partys sole discretion).

13.13 _Confidentiality_ _._  The Confidentiality Agreement shall terminate on
the Closing Date and will thereafter be of no further force or effect. Each
Party shall keep confidential, and cause its Affiliates and instruct its
Representatives to keep confidential, all terms and provisions of this
Agreement, except (a) as required by Legal Requirements or any standards or
rules of any stock exchange to which such Party or any of its Affiliates is
subject, (b) for information that is available to the public on the Closing
Date, or thereafter becomes available to the public other than as a result of
a breach of this _Section_ __ _ 13.13_, (c) to the extent required to be
disclosed in connection with complying with or obtaining a waiver of
any Preferential Purchase Right or Consent, (d) to any Affiliate or
Representative, (e) in the case of Buyer, to any potential purchaser of (or
joint venture partner with respect) to all or any portion of the Assets and
any direct and/or indirect (current or potential) investor or lender, and (f)
to the extent that such Party must disclose the same in any Proceeding brought
or Threatened by or against it to enforce or defend its rights under this
Agreement. This  _Section_ __ _ 13.13_ shall not prevent either Party from
recording the Instruments of Conveyance delivered at the Closing or from
complying with any disclosure requirements of Governmental Bodies that are
applicable to the transfer of the Assets. Additionally, from and after the
Closing, Seller shall keep confidential and not use any of the Records other
than for tax purposes or in connection with any Proceeding or Threatened
Proceeding against Seller. The covenant set forth in this Section shall
terminate two (2) years after the Closing Date.

13.14 _Name Change._ As promptly as practicable, but in any event within
sixty (60) days after the Closing Date, Buyer shall eliminate, remove or paint
over the use of the name "Linn" and variants thereof from the Assets, and,
except with respect to such grace period for

 



84  eliminating the existing usage, shall have no right to use any logos,
trademarks, or trade names belonging to Seller or any of its Affiliates. Buyer
shall be solely responsible for any direct or indirect costs or expenses
resulting from the change in use of name and any resulting notification or
approval requirements.

13.15  _Preparation of Agreement._ Both Seller and Buyer and their respective
counsel participated in the preparation of this Agreement. In the event of any
ambiguity in this Agreement, no presumption shall arise based on the identity
of the draftsman of this Agreement.

13.16 _Appendices, Exhibits and Schedules._ All of the Appendices, Exhibits
and Schedules referred to in this Agreement are hereby incorporated into this
Agreement by reference and constitute a part of this Agreement. Each Party to
this Agreement and its counsel has received a complete set of Appendices,
Exhibits and Schedules prior to and as of the execution of this Agreement.

13.17 _Specific Performance._ Each Party hereby acknowledges and agrees that
the rights of each Party to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby
are special, unique and of extraordinary character and that, if Seller, or
after Closing, Buyer, violates or fails or refuses to perform any covenant or
agreement made by it herein, the non-breaching Parties may be without an
adequate remedy at law. If Seller, or after Closing, Buyer violates or fails
or refuses to perform any covenant or agreement made by such Party herein, the
non-breaching Parties, subject to the terms hereof and in addition to any
remedy at law for damages or other relief permitted under this Agreement, may
(at any time prior to the valid termination of this Agreement pursuant to
_Article 9_ ) institute and prosecute an action in any court of competent
jurisdiction to enforce specific performance of such covenant or agreement or
seek any other equitable relief, without the necessity of proving actual
damages or posting of a bond. For clarity, Seller shall only have the right
to seek specific performance of Buyers covenants and agreements contained
herein following the Closing.

 

13.18 _Non-Recourse_. This Agreement may only be enforced against, and any
Damages based upon, arising out of, or related to this Agreement or the
negotiation, execution or performance of this Agreement may only be brought
against, the entities that are expressly named as Parties hereto and then only
with respect to the specific obligations set forth herein or therein with
respect to such Party. For further clarity, no past, present or future
director, manager, officer, employee, incorporator, member, partner,
stockholder, Affiliate, agent, attorney or other representative (in each
case, in their capacities as such) of any Party hereto or of any Affiliate of
any Party hereto or any such past, present or future director, manager,
officer, employee, incorporator, member, partner, stockholder,
Affiliate, agent, attorney or other representative (in each case, in their
capacities as such) (collectively, a _"_ _Party Affiliate_ "), or any of their
successors or permitted assigns, shall have any liability for any obligations
or liabilities of any Party hereto or thereto under this Agreement or for any
Damages based on, in respect of or by reason of the transactions contemplated
hereby or thereby.
