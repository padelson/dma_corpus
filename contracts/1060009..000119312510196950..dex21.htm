Representative, on behalf of such Seller, will use commercially reasonable
efforts to provide the Purchaser with prompt notice of such requirement. To
the extent legally permissible and at the Purchasers sole expense, the Seller
Representative, on behalf of such Seller, shall provide the Purchaser, in

at the Purchasers sole expense, if permitted by applicable Law, to the extent
the Purchaser may reasonably seek to limit such disclosure in a manner

_Transferred Employees_ ". The employment of each Transferred Employee shall
be effective as of the Effective Time or such later date as the Transferred

any current or former employee of Seller, whether or not such employee is

participate, subject to any required approval of the applicable insurance
provider, if any, the Purchaser shall use its reasonable best efforts, with
respect to the period from the Effective Time to December 31, 2010, (i) to
cause to be waived any eligibility waiting periods, any evidence of
insurability requirements and the application of any pre-existing
condition limitations under such plan, except to the extent that such waiting
period, evidence of insurability requirement, or pre-existing condition
limitations would not have been satisfied or waived under the comparable Plan
in which the Transferred Employee participated immediately prior to the
Effective Time, and (ii) to the extent commercially practicable, to cause each
Transferred Employee to be given credit under such plan for all amounts paid
by such Transferred Employee under any similar Plan for the plan year that

Purchaser or the relevant Subsidiary, as applicable, for the plan year in
which the Closing Date occurs.

 

7.8 Conduct of the Principals. During the period from the Execution Date and
continuing until the earlier of the termination of this Agreement or the

of any of its equity interests in any of the Sellers, in whole or in part,
without the prior written consent of the Purchaser.

 

7.9 Efforts and Actions.

 

(a) Each Party shall from time to time and without further consideration,
before and after the Closing, and at no material cost or liability to itself,
execute such further instruments and take such other actions as any other
Party hereto shall reasonably request for itself or on behalf of a third party
(including, for example, requests on behalf of the Escrow Agent or
Title Company regarding escrow instructions, or owners affidavit and gap
indemnity), provided such requests are solely in furtherance of its
obligations set forth in any of the Transaction Documents and are wholly
consistent therewith, to effectuate the purposes and terms set forth in the

to amend or modify any agreements applicable to the Hospital Business, or make
any promise to do so and the Purchaser shall indemnify and hold harmless the
Sellers from any Loss incurred by the Sellers as a result of the Purchasers
conduct in this regard.

(c) In order to consummate the transaction contemplated by this Agreement the
Purchaser and the Sellers agree to execute, deliver and be bound by
commercially reasonable supplemental escrow instructions of Real Property

negotiate reasonable terms of such instructions and instruments. Any such
supplemental instructions shall not conflict with, amend or supersede any
portions of this Agreement. To the extent of any inconsistency between the
provisions of such supplemental instructions and the provisions of this
Agreement, the provisions of this Agreement shall control.

 

(d) Before the Closing, the Sellers shall take all necessary actions to
terminate that certain Administrative and Management Services Agreement

signatory authority, (b) the Sellers do not have any ownership or control of
the Medical Staff Funds, and (c) the Purchaser shall not, as a result of the

accounts (each, a " _Government Accounts Receivable Account_ " and
collectively, the " _Government Accounts Receivable Accounts_ ") with
JPMorgan Chase Bank, NA (" _Agent_ ") on or before the Closing Date. The
Sellers shall use commercially reasonable efforts to seek to cause the
Government Payors to change their respective pay-to addresses such that
proceeds from each accounts receivable for which a Government Payor is the
account debtor, with respect to services provided after the Effective Time
only, shall be deposited directly into the Government Accounts Receivable
Accounts. The Sellers shall provide the Purchaser periodic updates regarding
such efforts as the Purchaser may reasonably request from time to time.

Business Day, all funds deposited in the Government Accounts Receivable
Accounts to an account designated by the Purchaser in the name of and subject
to the control of the Purchaser, and any disposition of such funds or action
by the Sellers to the contrary shall constitute a breach of the Sellers
covenants under this _Section 7.12_. The Sellers shall provide to the
Purchaser, on a weekly basis, copies of all remittances and other supporting
documentation relating to such funds and their disposition. On the Closing
Date, the Sellers shall appoint the Purchaser as exclusive agent, and the

with respect to the Government Accounts Receivable Accounts except to the
extent that such Collection Services would be inconsistent with the
requirements of this _Section 7.12_ or applicable Law and provided that the
Purchaser shall provide to the Sellers a true, correct and complete
accounting thereof on a monthly basis.

(and rights thereto) with respect to such damage or destruction, or (B) if, in
the Sellers sole but reasonable discretion, there is not sufficient time for
the Sellers to restore such damaged Leased Real Property prior to the Closing

Purchased Assets prior to the Closing Date (as may be determined by Sellers in
their sole but reasonable discretion), then the Purchase Price shall be
reduced by the cost to restore such lost, damaged or destroyed Purchased
Assets. In all events the Sellers shall have the sole right to retain all
insurance proceeds or rights thereto.

proceed with the transactions contemplated hereby, subject to the Purchasers
right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to _Section 9.4_ below, excluding
the Leased Real Property for which the applicable Real Property Lease has been

negotiate, for up to sixty (60) days, an appropriate adjusted Purchase Price,
and (ii) the Sellers shall be entitled, subject to the terms of the applicable
Real Property Lease, to all compensation, sums or anything of value awarded,
paid or received by the Sellers as a result of such partial or total Taking ("
_Condemnation Proceeds_ ");

 

(b) if, as a result of a partial or total Taking of Leased Real Property prior
to the Closing Date, the applicable Real Property Lease is not and cannot be

Real Property to offset the effect of the partial or total Taking prior to the
Closing Date, in which event Sellers shall be entitled, subject to the terms
of the applicable Real Property Lease, to that portion of such Condemnation
Proceeds allocable to such restoration costs, or (ii) if, in the Sellers sole
but reasonable discretion, there is not sufficient time for the Sellers to
accomplish prior to the Closing Date such restoration or the Taking has not
yet been completed as of the Closing Date, then the Purchaser shall accomplish
after the Closing Date such restoration, the Purchase Price shall be reduced
by such restoration cost and Purchaser shall pay over to Seller promptly
following receipt from the condemning authority of that portion of any
Condemnation Proceeds allocable to such restoration costs.

 



 

61 9.3 Inability to Agree on Adjusted Purchase Price. If the Purchaser and the
Sellers are unable to agree on an appropriate adjustment to the Purchase
Price in accordance with _Section 9.1_ or _9.2_ , after good-faith
negotiation for a period of up to sixty (60) days, then such adjustment shall
be determined in accordance with the procedures set forth in _Section 9.5_.

9.4 Termination Right. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in
this _Article IX_ , this Agreement may be terminated at any time prior to
Closing by written notice from the Purchaser to the Sellers, in the
Purchasers sole discretion, or by written notice from the Sellers to the

termination right shall only arise in the event that Sellers would clearly
realize (including the Debt Payoff Amount) as a consequence of such damage,
destruction or Condemnation of any Leased Real Property a sum (taking into
account the reduced Purchase Price and the insurance proceeds or the
Condemnation Proceeds) that is less than the Purchase Price), but only within
the 30-day period following the applicable Partys receipt of notice of any
applicable event described below giving rise to its right of termination, if
any damage, destruction or Condemnation of any Leased Real Property (other
than any damage or destruction caused by the Party seeking termination or its
employees, agents, or contractors) that renders it or them Unsuitable for Its
Primary Intended Use and that is not capable of being restored, or the
restoration requirements of this _Article IX_ are not being fulfilled,
unless, prior to the Closing Date, restoration of such Leased Real Property is
actually completed or, as applicable, all of the funds for such restoration
required under this _Article IX_ have been transferred to the
Applicable Party.

9.5 Procedures for Determining Purchase Price Adjustment.

 

(a) If, in connection with the adjustments in the Purchase Price contemplated
by _Sections 9.1(a)(i)_ , _9.1(a)(ii)_ ,  _9.2(a_ ), or _9.2(b)_ , the
Purchaser and the Sellers are unable to agree on the amount of such adjustment
(i.e., the Fair Market Value of the Leased Real Property for which the
applicable Real Property Lease has been terminated or the Fair Market Value
of the Leased Real Property rendered Unsuitable for Its Primary Intended Use,
as applicable) within forty-five (45) days following the Determination Date,
then the amount of such adjustment shall be the Fair Market Value of
the Leased Real Property determined, as of the day before such Determination
Date, by an appraiser acceptable to the Purchaser and the Seller
Representative, in their respective sole discretion, the fees of which shall
be paid one-half by the Purchaser and one-half by the Sellers. If such
parties are unable to agree on an appraiser within sixty (60) days after the
Determination Date, each such party shall select an appraiser, the fees of
which, respectively, shall be paid by the selecting party. The two appraisers
so named shall select a third appraiser, who is not affiliated with either of
such appointing appraisers, who shall appraise the Fair Market Value of the
Leased Real Property. Any such appraiser selected hereunder shall be an MAI
appraiser licensed by the State of California, shall not be related to or
affiliated with the Purchaser, any Seller or any Affiliate of either, shall
have no conflict of interest (as determined in accordance with the ethical
rules applicable to MAI appraisers), shall be experienced in the valuation of
long-term acute care hospitals in the market in which the Leased Real Property
is located, and shall confirm to each party that it has no prior or current
relationships with either party (such prior or current relationships shall
alone disqualify such appraiser from determing the Fair Market Value
hereunder). In determining the Fair Market Value of the Leased Real Property,
the appraiser so appointed shall consider all opinions and relevant evidence
timely submitted to it by the Purchaser or the Sellers, or otherwise
independently obtained by such appraiser. The appraiser shall determine the
Fair Market Value of the Leased Real Property. The appraiser shall set forth
its determination in writing, together with its opinion and the
considerations on which such opinion is based, with a signed counterpart to be
delivered to each party within forty-five (45) days after the appraiser is
notified of and accepts its appointment as the appraiser. Such determination
shall be final, binding and conclusive on the Purchaser and the Sellers
(without right of appeal), absent manifest or mathematical error.

 



 

62 (b) If, in connection with the adjustments in the Purchase Price contemplated
by _Sections 9.1(a)(iii)_ , _9.1(b)_ or _9.2(c)_ , the Purchaser and the
Sellers are unable to agree on the amount of such adjustment (i.e., the cost
to restore the damaged Leased Real Property, the cost to restore the damaged
or destroyed Purchased Assets constituting personal property or the cost to
restore the Leased Real Property to a usable whole following a Taking, as
applicable) within forty-five (45) days following the Determination Date, then
the amount of such adjustment shall be determined by an arbitrator mutually
acceptable to the Purchaser and the Seller Representative with experience in
real estate construction-related disputes. Such arbitrators conduct will be
governed by the rules of the Judicial Arbitration and Mediation Services,
Inc. (" _JAMS_ "). The arbitration will be conducted in Los Angeles,
California, in accordance with the rules of JAMS and the discovery rules of
the California Rules of Civil Procedure. The arbitrators fees shall be
shared equally by the Purchaser, on the one hand, and the Sellers, on the
other hand.

POST-CLOSING RIGHTS AND OBLIGATIONS

 

10.1 Payment of Obligations. The Sellers shall pay, perform, discharge and
satisfy when due in accordance with their respective terms all of the
Excluded Liabilities.

10.2 Assumed Liabilities. After the Closing, the Purchaser shall duly
and timely pay and perform all of the Assumed Liabilities in the ordinary
course of business as they become due.

10.3 Adjustment of Operating Expenses. All operating expenses of the Hospital
Business (other than Transfer Taxes, which shall be governed by _Section
7.2(d))_, including, but not limited to, equipment maintenance contracts and
utilities expenses, shall, except for the Assumed Liabilities and the
brokers and finders fees, attorneys fees and all other fees incurred in
connection with the negotiation and consummation of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement and as otherwise expressly provided herein, be
adjusted and allocated between the Sellers and the Purchaser to the extent
necessary in order that all such expenses attributable to the operation of the
Hospital Business on or before the date preceding the Effective Time
(regardless of the date of order or invoice) shall be for the account of, and
paid by, the Sellers, and all such expenses attributable to the operation of
the Hospital Business from, after and including the date of the Effective
Time (regardless of the date of order or invoice) shall be for the account of,
and paid by, the Purchaser.



 

63 (a) To the extent not inconsistent with the express provisions of this
Agreement, the allocations made pursuant to this _Section 10.3_ shall be
made in accordance with GAAP.

(b) For purposes of making the adjustments pursuant to this _Section 10.3_,
within ninety (90) days following the Closing Date, or such earlier or later
date as shall be mutually agreed to in writing by the Purchaser and the
Sellers (such period, the " _Adjustment Period_ "), the Purchaser and the
Seller Representative shall agree on an itemized list (the " _Adjustment List_
") of all sums to be credited to or charged against the account of the
Purchaser, with a brief explanation in reasonable detail thereof. Such list
shall show the net amount credited to or charged against the account of the
Purchaser (the " _Adjustment Amount_ "). If the Adjustment Amount is a credit
to the account of the Purchaser, the Sellers shall pay such amount to the
Purchaser; and if the Adjustment Amount is a charge to the account of the
Purchaser, the Purchaser shall pay such amount to the Sellers on a pro rata
basis as set forth on _Schedule 10.3(b)_  hereto. Payment of the Adjustment
Amount shall be made by the applicable party or parties not later than fifteen
(15) Business Days following the completion of the Adjustment List in
immediately available funds to the bank account designated in writing by the
applicable recipient thereof.

(c) In the event that the Seller Representative and the Purchaser cannot
agree on the Adjustment List within the Adjustment Period, either the Seller
Representative or the Purchaser may submit such disagreement by sending a
written notice (a " _Dispute Notice_ "), along with all supporting information
and applicable worksheets, to the other Parties and KPMG LLP (hereinafter
referred to as the " _Independent Accounting Firm_ ") for final binding
resolution in accordance with _Section 10.3(d)_; _provided_ , _however_
, that no representative of the Independent Accounting Firm that has ever
represented, or is then representing, the Purchaser or the Guarantor (or any
of their respective Affiliates) shall participate in this process.

 

(d) _Adjustment List Disputes_. The Dispute Notice shall identify each
disputed item on the Adjustment List, specify the amount of such dispute and
set forth the basis for such dispute. The Independent Accounting Firm shall
resolve only the items set forth in the Dispute Notice and make a
determination of the computation of the relevant amounts, which shall be
final, binding and conclusive on all Parties. In resolving any disputed item,
the Independent Accounting Firm (i) shall be bound by any relevant provisions
of this Agreement, and (ii) may not assign a value to any item (x) greater
than the greatest value for such items claimed by either the Purchaser or the
Seller Representative, or (y) less than the smallest value of such items
claimed by either the Purchaser or the Seller Representative. The fees, costs
and expenses of the Independent Accounting Firms review and determination as
set forth in this _Section 10.6(d)_ shall be allocated based on the inverse
of the percentage its determination (before such allocation) bears to the
amount in dispute as originally submitted to the Independent Accounting Firm.
For example, in the event the amount in dispute totals an amount equal to
$1,000 and the Independent Accounting Firm awards $600 in favor of the Seller
Representatives position, sixty percent (60%) of the fees and costs of the
Independent Accounting Firms review would be borne by the Purchaser, and
forty percent (40%) of the fees and costs of its review would be borne by the
Sellers.

 



 

64 10.4 Website and Email Addresses.

 

(a) After the Effective Time, except in connection with operations under the
Management Agreement, the Sellers, the Principals and their respective
Affiliates shall be permitted to use the names "Vista" and "Vista Healthcare"
only to pay Accounts Payable and collect the Accounts Receivable and shall, in
any event, except as may be permitted by Purchaser in writing, upon the later
to occur of (i) termination of the Management Agreement, or (ii) twenty-four
months following the Effective Time, cease all use of the names "Vista" and
"Vista Healthcare" and at such time the Sellers shall change their respective
organizational documents, websites and all advertising and derivatives thereof
to remove any references to such names and the Hospital Business. The Sellers,
the Principals and their respective Affiliates will refrain from discussing
the Hospital Business in any and all advertising material and related
promotional materials related to any business that any of them operates;
_provided_ , _however_ , that they shall be free to identify their role
in the Hospital Business and the general nature and scope of the Hospital
Business.

(b) After the Effective Time, except in connection with operations under the
Management Agreement, the Sellers, the Principals (excluding The Tavitian
GRAT) and their respective Affiliates shall be permitted to continue to use
the email addresses currently used in the Hospital Business only in
connection with payment of Accounts Payable and collection of the Accounts
Receivable, which use may continue in any event only until the later to occur
of (i) termination of the Management Agreement, or (ii) twenty-four
months following the Effective Time except as may be permitted by Purchaser
in writing. Except as provided in the preceding sentence, the Sellers, the
Principals and their respective Affiliates shall, upon the termination of the
Management Agreement, refrain from all use of all email addresses currently
used in the Hospital Business by all employees and independent contractors and
shall change such email addresses within twenty (20) days after the
termination of the Management Agreement. The Sellers shall provide the
Purchaser with copies of all emails related to the Hospital Business received
by its employees and independent contractors after the Effective Time, within
two (2) Business Days of receipt. The Sellers shall delete all such emails
once they are provided to the Purchaser.

10.5 Misdirected Payments, etc. After the Closing, (a) the Sellers shall
remit to the Purchaser with reasonable promptness (within five (5) Business
Days) any monies or other assets received by the Sellers constituting or in
respect of the Purchased Assets and the Assumed Liabilities, and (b) the
Purchaser shall remit to the appropriate Seller with reasonable promptness
(within five (5) Business Days) any monies or other assets received by the
Purchaser constituting or in respect of any of the Excluded Assets or
the Excluded Liabilities. If funds previously paid or credited to the Sellers
or the Hospital Business in respect of services rendered prior to the
Effective Time have resulted in an overpayment or must be repaid, the Sellers
shall be responsible for the repayment of said monies (and the defense of
such actions) and the Purchaser shall be entitled to prompt payment of such
monies directly from the Sellers or the Principals. If funds previously paid
or credited to the Sellers or the Hospital Business in respect of services
rendered prior to the Effective Time do not reflect the full payment for such
services rendered and the Purchaser is subsequently paid funds otherwise due
to the Sellers in connection with such services rendered, the Sellers shall
be entitled to prompt payment of said monies directly from the Purchaser. With
respect to any such claim under this _Section 10.5_, the Purchaser or the
Sellers, as the case may be, shall be entitled to only one recovery for such
claim, and a Party that has received an amount in excess of the amount of such
claim because it has received funds from more than one source shall promptly
restore the excess of such recovery to the other Party.

 



 

65 10.6 Cost Reports. The Sellers shall prepare and file with its fiscal
intermediary the final Medicare cost reports covering its operation of the
Hospital Business through the Effective Time as soon as reasonably practicable
after the Effective Time, but in no event later than the date on which such
final cost report is required to be filed by applicable Law under the terms
of the Medicare program, and will provide the fiscal intermediary or the
Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services with any information needed to
support claims for reimbursement made by the Seller either in said final cost
report or in any cost reports filed for prior cost reporting periods, it being
specifically understood and agreed that the intent and purpose of this
provision is to ensure that the reimbursement paid to the Purchaser after
it becomes the operator of the Hospital Business is not reduced or offset in
any manner as a result of the Sellers failure to timely file, or filing an
inaccurate or incomplete, final cost report or supporting documentation with
respect to any past reimbursement claims, including, but not limited to,
those included in the final cost report. Simultaneously with such filing, the
Sellers shall provide the Purchaser with a copy of the final Medicare cost
reports and such supporting documentation reasonably requested by the
Purchaser in writing.

from or in connection with (A) any Excluded Liability, (B) a breach of,
untruth of, or inaccuracy in a representation or warranty contained in
_Sections 5.1_ or _5.5_ , or (C) any payment obligation of the Sellers or
Principals arising under _Section 10.5_;



 

67 (ii) subject to _Section 11.2(b)(i)_, once the Indemnification Threshold
is reached, the Purchaser Indemnified Parties may seek indemnification to
recover the amount of Losses in excess of the Indemnification Threshold
subject to _Section 11.2(b)(iii)_; and

 

(iii) once the Indemnification Threshold is reached, the Purchaser Indemnified
Parties may seek indemnification to recover the additional amount of Losses
up to an aggregate of Twenty Million Dollars ($20,000,000) and no more (the "
_Indemnification Cap_ ") pursuant to the procedures contained in this _Article
XI_ ; _provided_ , _however_ , that the Indemnification Cap shall not apply
with respect to any Loss arising out of or resulting from (A) any
indemnification sought pursuant to _Sections 11.2(a)(iii)_ and _11.2(a)(iv)_ ,
(B) fraud, willful misconduct, or intentional misrepresentation by the
Sellers or the Principals, (C) any breach of, untruth of, or inaccuracy in a
representation or warranty contained in _Sections 5.1_ or _5.5_ , or (D) any
payment obligation of the Sellers or Principals arising under _Section 10.5_
(collectively, the " _Indemnity Cap Exclusions_ ").

(c) With respect to any indemnification obligations under this _Section
11.2_, such obligations shall be joint and several among the Sellers and the
Principals, and in the case of the Principals, up to the amount for each
respective Principal set forth on  _Schedule 11.2(c)_ hereto and no more
under any circumstances other than with respect to the Indemnity Cap
Exclusions.

 

(d) Notwithstanding the other provisions of this _Section 11.2_, the
Principals shall not be personally liable with respect to any breach of the
representations contained in _Section 5.12(e)_ or _Section 5.12(f)_.

11.3 Indemnification by the Purchaser.

(a) The Purchaser shall indemnify and hold harmless the Sellers and each of
their agents and representatives, and the successors and assigns of each of
the foregoing (the " _Seller Indemnified Parties_ "), from and against any
Loss incurred or suffered by such Seller Indemnified Party as a result of or
arising from: 

(i) a breach of, untruth of or inaccuracy in any representation or warranty
made by or on behalf of the Purchaser in this Agreement or any schedule,
certificate, instrument or other document delivered pursuant hereto or
thereto;

(ii) a failure by the Purchaser to perform or comply with any covenant set
forth in _Article VII_ on the part of the Purchaser; and

(iii) any obligations arising with respect to a Purchased Asset from and
after the Closing Date, and any Assumed Liability;

(iv) a failure by the Manager under the Management Agreement or the Lessor
under the Facility Lease to meet their obligations under their respective
agreements; and

 

(v) a failure by the Guarantor to meet its obligations under this Agreement,
the Management Agreement or the Facility Lease.

 



 

68 (b) Notwithstanding _Section 11.3(a)_, the Purchaser shall not have any
obligation to indemnify the Seller Indemnified Parties from and against any
Loss under clause (i) or (ii) of _Section 11.3(a)_ unless and until such
claim or claims for all such Losses exceeds an amount equal to the
Indemnification Threshold; _provided_ , _however_ , that such Indemnification
Threshold shall not apply to any Loss as a result of, arising from or in
connection with, the Purchasers payment obligations arising under _Section
7.2(b)_ or  _Section 10.5_. Subject to the immediately preceding sentence,
once the Indemnification Threshold is reached, the Seller Indemnified Parties
may seek indemnification from the first dollar of all such Losses incurred or
suffered up to an amount equal to the Indemnification Cap pursuant to the
procedures contained in this _Article XI_.

11.4 No Circular Recovery. No Principal shall make any claim for
indemnification against the Purchaser (or any successor thereto) by reason of
the fact that such Principal was a controlling person, director, employee or
representative of any Seller or was serving as such for another Person at the
request of the Purchaser (whether such claim is for losses of any kind or
otherwise and whether such claim is pursuant to any statute, organizational
document of any Person, Contractual Obligation or otherwise) with respect to
any claim brought by a Purchaser Indemnified Party against any Principal
relating to this Agreement or any other transaction contemplated hereby.

 

11.5 Other Indemnification Matters.

 

(a) If the Purchaser fully collects Losses from the Sellers or Principals in
connection with the breach of any of the representations, warranties,
covenants and agreements made by the Sellers or Principals in this Agreement,
and the Purchaser subsequently collects any funds that were the basis for the
Purchasers claim for such indemnification, the Purchaser shall
promptly remit the amount so collected to the Seller Representative for
reimbursement from which the Losses were received without demand, deduction,
offset or delay.

 

(b) The Purchaser agrees that with respect to any claim for indemnification
made on behalf of any Purchaser Indemnified Party, such Purchaser Indemnified
Party shall seek to recover (i) first, from the Escrow Amount to the extent of
its availability and adequacy, and if the claim is not satisfied, then, and
only then (ii) directly from the Sellers and the Principals on a joint and
several basis as set forth in _Section 11.2(c)_.

(c) Any Loss for which any Purchaser Indemnified Party is entitled to
indemnification under this _Article XI_ shall be determined without
duplication of recovery by reason of the state of facts giving rise to such
Loss constituting a breach of more than one representation, warranty, covenant
or agreement.

(d) Any indemnification payments made pursuant to this Agreement shall be
treated as an adjustment to the Purchase Price (as determined for U.S.
federal income tax purposes) and shall be reflected as an adjustment to the
consideration allocated to a specific asset, if any, giving rise to the
adjustment and if any such adjustment does not relate to a specific asset,
such adjustment shall be allocated in accordance with the allocation
principles set forth in _Section 2.8_.



 

69 (e) Any claims with respect to any Transaction Document other than this
Agreement shall be made pursuant to the terms and conditions of such other
Transaction Document. The indemnification obligations of the parties under
this _Article XI_ are limited to claims arising under or with respect to this
Agreement.

 

11.6 Assumption of Defense. An Indemnified Party (or in the case of a Seller
Indemnified Party, the Seller Representative) shall promptly give notice to
each Indemnifying Party after obtaining knowledge of any matter as to which
recovery may be sought against such Indemnifying Party because of the
indemnity set forth above, and, if such indemnity shall arise from the claim
of a third party, shall permit such Indemnifying Party to assume the defense
of any such claim or any proceeding resulting from such claim; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that failure to give any such notice promptly shall not affect
the indemnification provided under this _Article XI_ , except, and only, to
the extent such Indemnifying Party shall have been actually prejudiced as a
result of such failure. Notwithstanding the foregoing, an Indemnifying Party
may not assume the defense of any such third-party claim if the claim (i)
could result in imprisonment of or imposition of a civil or criminal fine
against the Indemnified Party, (ii) could result in an equitable remedy that
would impair the Indemnified Partys ability to exercise its rights under
this Agreement, or impair the Purchasers right or ability to use the
Purchased Assets or operate any Hospital, or (iii) the claim names both the
Indemnifying Party and the Indemnified Party (including impleaded parties)
and representation of both such Parties by the same counsel would create a
conflict. If an Indemnifying Party assumes the defense of such third party
claim, such Indemnifying Party shall agree prior thereto, in writing, that it
is liable under this _Article XI_ to indemnify the Indemnified Party in
accordance with the terms contained herein in respect of such claim, shall
conduct such defense diligently, shall have full and complete control over
the conduct of such proceeding on behalf of the Indemnified Party and shall,
subject to the provisions of this _Section 11.6_, have the right to decide
all matters of procedure, strategy, substance and settlement relating to such
proceeding;  _provided_ , _however_ , that any counsel chosen by such
Indemnifying Party to conduct such defense shall be reasonably satisfactory to
the Indemnified Party (or in the case of a Seller Indemnified Party, the
Seller Representative); and  _provided_ , _further_ , _however_ , that the
Indemnifying Party shall not without the written consent of the Indemnified
Party (or in the case of a Seller Indemnified Party, the Seller
Representative) consent to the entry of any judgment or enter into any
settlement with respect to the matter which (x) does not include a provision
whereby the plaintiff or the claimant in the matter releases the Indemnified
Party from all liability with respect thereto, and (y) in the case of the
Purchaser, does not include any provision that would impose any obligation
(including an obligation to refrain from taking action) upon the Sellers. The
Indemnified Party may participate in such proceeding and retain separate co-
counsel at its sole cost and expense. Failure by an Indemnifying Party to
notify the Indemnified Party (or in the case of a Seller Indemnified Party,
the Seller Representative) of its election to defend any such claim or
proceeding by a third party within thirty (30) days after notice thereof, or
such shorter time necessary to timely respond to a court filing, shall have
been given to such Indemnifying Party by the Indemnified Party (or in the case
of a Seller Indemnified Party, the Seller Representative), shall be deemed a
waiver by such Indemnifying Party of its right to defend such claim or Action.

 

11.7 Non-Assumption of Defense. If no Indemnifying Party is permitted or
elects to assume the defense of any such claim by a third party or proceeding
resulting therefrom, the Indemnified Party shall diligently defend against
such claim or litigation in such manner as it may deem appropriate and, in
such event, the Indemnifying Party or parties shall reimburse the
Indemnified Party for all reasonable and actually incurred out-of-pocket
costs and expenses, legal or otherwise, incurred by the Indemnified Party and
its Affiliates in connection with the defense against such claim or
proceeding, within thirty (30) days after the receipt of detailed invoices.
The Indemnified Party shall not settle or compromise any such claim without
providing the Indemnifying Party with at least fifteen (15) days prior written
notice, together with complete copies of all settlement documentation.



 

70 11.8 Indemnified Partys Cooperation as to Proceedings. The Indemnified
Party will cooperate in all reasonable respects with any Indemnifying Party
in the conduct of any proceeding as to which such Indemnifying Party assumes
the defense, except to the extent the Indemnified Party could reasonably be
expected to be prejudiced thereby. The Indemnifying Party or parties shall
promptly reimburse the Indemnified Party for all reasonable and actually
incurred out-of-pocket costs and expenses, legal or otherwise, incurred by the
Indemnified Party or its Affiliates in connection therewith, within thirty
(30) days after the receipt of detailed invoices.

ARTICLE XII

 

TERMINATION; EFFECT OF TERMINATION

 

12.1 Termination. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, this
Agreement may be terminated and the transactions contemplated hereby
abandoned at any time prior to the Closing Date:

(a) by mutual written consent of the Seller Representative and the Purchaser;

(b) by the Purchaser, at any time prior to the Closing, if a Material Adverse
Effect with respect to the Hospital Business or any individual Hospital shall
have occurred since December 31, 2009; _provided_ , _however_ , that if the
Purchaser is in material breach of any of its representations, warranties or
covenants set forth in this Agreement, the Purchaser shall not be entitled to
exercise its rights to terminate under this _Section 12.1(b)_;

 

(c) by the Sellers, on the one hand, or the Purchaser, on the other hand, if
the other (the Sellers on the one hand, or the Purchaser on the other hand)
has breached this Agreement in any material respect and failed to cure any
such breach, to the satisfaction of the other Parties hereto, in their sole
discretion, within five (5) days of receipt of written notice of such
breach; 

(d) by either the Purchaser or the Sellers in the event that (i) any Law shall
have been enacted or promulgated by any Governmental Authority that directly
prohibits the consummation of the Closing and the transactions contemplated
hereby (including the transactions contemplated by the Management Agreement or
the Facility Lease), or (ii) any Order shall have been issued that expressly
precludes the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby;

(e) by the Sellers, if any Closing Condition set forth in _Section 8.1_ or
_Section 8.3_ shall not have been satisfied or waived by the Sellers on or
prior to November 22, 2010; or

 



 

71 (f) by the Purchaser, if any Closing Condition set forth in _Section 8.1_
or  _Section 8.2_ shall not have been satisfied or waived by the Purchaser
on or prior to November 22, 2010; _provided that_ notwithstanding the
immediately preceding clause, the Purchaser must give written notice to the
Seller Representative within sixty (60) days of the Execution Date that the
Closing Conditions set forth in _Sections 8.2(g)_ and _8.2(h)_ , other than
with respect to Rancho Specialty Hospital (Rancho Cucamonga), have either been
satisfied or waived or as the sole remedy for Purchasers failure to give
such notice, such Closing Conditions shall be deemed waived.

 

12.2 Effect of Termination.

 

(a) If this Agreement is terminated prior to the Closing and the transactions
contemplated hereby are not consummated as described above, this Agreement
shall become void and of no further force and effect, except for the
provisions of _Article XI_ (relating to indemnification), _Section 12.1_
(relating to termination) and _Article XIII_ (relating to
certain miscellaneous provisions).

(b) If this Agreement is terminated pursuant to _Section 12.1(a)_ or
_12.1(d)_ , none of the Parties shall be liable to the other Parties
hereunder for any liabilities and damages incurred as a result of such
termination.

the Purchased Assets hereunder and the transactions contemplated hereby,
including legal, accounting or other professional expenses of the Sellers
