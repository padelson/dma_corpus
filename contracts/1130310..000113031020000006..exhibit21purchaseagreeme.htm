Such  allocations  of  charges  and  credits  do  not  necessarily  reflect  the  amounts that would have resulted from arms-length transactions or the actual costs that would be  incurred if the Group Companies operated as an independent enterprise.                                          23 </FONT></DIV>

As of the date hereof, the Financing is subject to  no conditions precedent other than those set forth in the Commitment Letters and the Fee Letter.  As of the date hereof, there are no conditions precedent or other contractual contingencies (x)  related to the funding of the full amount of the Financing or any provisions that would reduce the  aggregate amount of the Financing set forth in any Commitment Letter or the aggregate proceeds  contemplated  by  any  Commitment  Letter  below  the  amount  necessary  to  consummate  the  transactions  contemplated  by  this  Agreement or  (y)  that  would  otherwise  adversely  affect  the  conditionality, enforceability or availability of the Financing. As of the date hereof, assuming the  accuracy of the representations and warranties of Seller set forth in Article III, Buyer (1) is not in  breach of any of the terms or conditions set forth in the Commitment Letters and no event has  occurred which, with or without notice, lapse of time or both, would reasonably be expected to  constitute a material default or breach on the part of Buyer under any term or condition of the  Commitment Letters and (2) does not have any reason to believe that any of the conditions to the  Financing to be satisfied by it would not be satisfied on a timely basis (taking into account the  timing of the Marketing Period) or that the Debt Financing would not be available to Buyer on  the Closing Date.

It is accordingly agreed that, except as otherwise provided in this Section 10.13, the  Parties  shall  be  entitled  to  an  injunction  or  injunctions  to  prevent  breaches  or  anticipated  breaches  of  this  Agreement  and  to  specifically  enforce  the  terms  and  provisions  of  this  Agreement, without proof of actual damages  or otherwise, in  addition  to any other  remedy to  which any Party is entitled at Law or in equity.

The Parties further agree  not to assert that a remedy of specific enforcement is unenforceable, invalid, contrary to law or  inequitable for any reason, nor to assert that a remedy of monetary damages would provide an  adequate  remedy.  To  the  extent  any  Party  brings  an  action,  suit  or  proceeding  to  enforce  specifically the performance of the terms and provisions of this Agreement (other than an action  to enforce specifically any provision that expressly survives termination of this Agreement), the  Outside Date shall automatically be extended to (i) the twentieth (20th) Business Day following  the resolution of such action, suit or proceeding or (ii) such other time period established by the  court presiding over such action, suit or proceeding.

For the  avoidance of  doubt, although Seller may  pursue  both  a  grant  of  specific  performance  to  the  extent  permitted  by  this Section  10.13 and  the  payment  of  the  Termination  Fee, under  no  circumstances shall Seller be permitted or entitled to receive both a grant of specific performance  to require Buyer to consummate the Closing and payment of the Termination Fee.
