of Buyer Common Stock, warrants and the  shares  of Buyer Common Stock

and other  rights  contained in Section 6 of this Agreement  and,  solely
for the purposes of such Section 6 rights, shall be deemed to be  Registrable

(d) In  addition to the Aggregate Purchase Price, the following shall
constitute  additional consideration to be paid by the Buyer to the Seller
for the  acquisition by the Buyer of the SPV Shares:

 

 

(i) With  respect to the first full twelve month period following the Closing
Date,  in the  event that the Vessels achieve EBITDA for such period equal
to or in excess  of  $75,000,000, then the Seller shall be entitled to
receive, within 30 days  following the end of such period, an additional
3,000,000 shares of Buyer  Common  Stock at no cost. Any expense or other
charge to earnings incurred in  conjunction with the award of these
additional shares or other shares awarded  to  EIAC or management will be
added back to EBITDA for purposes of calculating  the  share award. In the
event that the Buyer sells any of the Vessels during  the  first full twelve
month period after the Merger, the consolidated EBITDA  hurdle  for the
first twelve month period will be reduced by an amount calculated  as 
follows:

 

 

First  Twelve Month Reduction =A * (365/C - 1)  -  (D*E*(1-y%)).

 

 

where

 

 

A  =  actual EBITDA contribution for the first twelve month period from the
Vessel  in  question up to and including the closing of the sale of such 
Vessel,

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

15  

 

 

 

 

 

 

C  = the  number of days during the first twelve month period up to and
including the  closing date of the sale of such Vessel,

 

 

D  = the  number of days of the scheduled offhire after the sale of such
Vessel (i.e.,  drydock or special survey) during the first twelve-month
period,

 

 

E  = the  gross time charter rate of such Vessel for the first twelve-month
period,  as  presented in Schedule 11(p)(vi), and

 

 

y%  = the  brokerage commission on the gross time charter rate of such
Vessel, as presented  in Schedule 11(p)(vi).

 

 

The  consolidated EBITDA hurdle for the second twelve month period shall be
reduced  by an amount calculated as follows:

 

 

Second  Twelve Month Reduction = A *(365/C)  - (D*E *  (1-y%)).

 

 

where

 

 

D  = the  number of days of the scheduled offhire after the sale of such
Vessel (i.e.,  drydock or special survey) during the first twelve-month
period,

 

 

E  = the  gross time charter rate of such Vessel for the second twelve-month
period,  as  presented in Schedule 11(p)(vi),  and

 

 

y%  = the  brokerage commission on the gross time charter rate of such
Vessel, as presented  in Schedule 11(p)(vi).

 

 

To  illustrate, assume Buyer sells Vessel X on the 90th day of the first
twelve  month period after the Closing Date, and that during the period from
the  Closing  Date up to and including the close of the 90th day Vessel X
has earned EBITDA  of  US$2,000,000. Assume also that Vessel X is due for
drydock during the first  twelve month period with projected 20 offhire days
and Vessel X is earning  a  gross charter rate of $28,000 per day less 1.25%
brokerage commission. Then  the  EBITDA hurdle rate for purposes of
calculating the earnout consideration  for the  first twelve months would 
be  reduced by US$5,558,111, calculated as follows:

 

 

US$2,000,000  * (365/90 - 1) - (US$28,000 * (1-1.25%) * 20) = US$5,558,111

 

 

and  the  EBITDA hurdle for the second twelve month period would be
reduced  by

 

 

US$2,000,000  * (365/90) - (US$28,000 * (1-1.25%) * 0) = US$8,111,111

 

 

**_plus_**

 

 

(ii) With  respect to the second twelve month period following the Closing
Date, in  the  event that the Vessels achieve EBITDA for such period equal
to or in excess  of  $75,000,000, then the Seller shall be entitled to
receive within 30 days  following the end of such period, an additional
3,000,000 shares of Buyer  Common  Stock at no cost. Any expense **or 
other charge to earnings** incurred  in conjunction with the award of these
additional shares or other shares  awarded  to EIAC or management will be
added back to EBITDA for purposes of calculating  the share award. In the
event that the Buyer sells any of the Vessels during  the  second twelve
month period after the Merger, the consolidated EBITDA hurdle  for  the
second twelve month period will be reduced by an amount calculated as 
follows:

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

16  

 

 

 

 

 

 

Second  Twelve Month Reduction =A * (365/C - 1)  -  (D*E*(1-y%)).

 

 

where

 

 

A  =  actual EBITDA contribution for the Vessel for the second twelve month
period  up  to and including the closing of the sale of such Vessel,

 

 

C  = the  number of days during the second twelve month period up to and
including  the  closing date of the sale of such Vessel,

 

 

D  = the  number of days of the scheduled offhire after the sale of such
Vessel (i.e.,  drydock or special survey) during the second twelve-month
period,

 

 

E  = the  gross time charter rate of such Vessel for the second twelve-month
period,  as  presented in Schedule 11(p)(vi), and

 

 

y%  = the  brokerage commission on the gross time charter rate of such
Vessel, as presented  in Schedule 11(p)(vi).

 

 

For  the  avoidance of doubt, the additional 6,000,000 shares of Buyer
Common Stock,  if  issued in accordance with subclauses (i) and (ii) above,
shall not be subject  to  any lock-up from the date of any such issuance.

**SECTION  6. ****REGISTRATION  RIGHTS; LOCK UP** **.**

 

 

(a) _Registration  on Form F-4 / S-4._   Buyer  shall include the
Registrable Securities in the Acquisition Registration  Statement to the
extent that such inclusion would not, in Buyer's reasonable  judgment, after
receiving written comments from the SEC that address the  registration of the
Registrable Securities, materially hinder or delay the  SEC's  declaration
of effectiveness thereof or approval of the Merger  Proxy.

 

 

(b) Registration  of Registrable Securities.

 

 

(i) _" Demand  Registration." _Upon  request by the Seller or any other
holder of Registrable Securities, from  time  to time the Buyer shall
prepare and file and use its best efforts to have  declared effective as soon
as is reasonably practical but in any event within  120 days from the date of
such request the Resale Registration Statement  with  the SEC and shall
include all of the Registrable Securities in such Resale  Registration
Statement (or such lesser number of shares of Registrable  Securities as is
permitted under SEC rules, regulations and interpretations)  and  shall keep
such Resale Registration Statement effective until all Registrable 
Securities are sold thereunder.

 

 

(ii) _" Piggyback  Registration Rights." _If  the  Buyer shall determine to
proceed with the preparation and filing of a new  registration statement
under the Securities Act in connection with the proposed  offer and sale of
any of its securities (other than a registration statement  on  Form F-4 /
S-4, S-8 or other limited purpose form), the Buyer will give written  notice
of its determination to any holder of Registrable Securities. Upon  the 
written request from any such holder of Registrable Securities, within 15 
days  after receipt of any such notice from the Buyer, the Buyer will cause
all  of the  Registrable Securities covered by such request (the "Requested
Stock") held by  any such holder of Registrable Securities to be included in
such registration  statement, all to the extent requisite to permit the sale
or other disposition  by the prospective seller or sellers of the Requested
Stock; provided that  nothing herein shall prevent the Buyer from, at any
time, abandoning or delaying  any such registration.

 

 

(c) _Registration  Procedures._   Pursuant  to the Buyer's obligations as
set forth in Section 6(a) and 6(b), the Buyer  will:

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

20  

 

 

 

 

 

 

(i) prepare  and file with the SEC the Acquisition Registration Statement
and, if requested  in accordance with the provisions of subparagraph (b)
above, the Resale  Registration Statement, and use its best efforts to cause
each such registration  statement to become and remain effective for such
period of time as may be  required for the disposition of such securities
covered by such registration  statement by the holders thereof (which period
of time shall not expire earlier  than the first date on which the
Registrable Securities Holders could sell  or  dispose the Registrable
Securities without restrictions pursuant to Rule  144(k)  promulgated under
the Securities Act);

 

 

(ii) prepare  and file with the SEC such amendments and supplements to such
registration  statement and the prospectus used in connection therewith as
may be necessary  to  keep such registration statement effective and to
comply with the provisions  of  the Securities Act with respect to the sale
or other disposition of all  securities covered by such registration
statement until such time as all  of such  securities have been fully
disposed of;

 

 

(iii) furnish  to all selling security holders (including the Registrable
Securities Holders)  such number of copies of the relevant prospectus,
including the relevant  preliminary prospectus, in conformity with the
requirements of the Securities  Act, and such other documents, as such
selling security holders may reasonably  request;

 

 

(iv) use  its  best efforts to register or qualify the securities covered by
such registration  statement under such other securities or blue sky laws of
such jurisdictions  within the United States and Puerto Rico as each holder
of such securities  shall  request ( _provided,  however,_ that  the 
Buyer shall not be obligated to qualify as a foreign corporation to do
business  under the laws of any jurisdiction in which it is not then
qualified or to  file  any general consent to service or process), and do
such other reasonable  acts  and things as may be required of it to enable
such holder to consummate the  disposition in such jurisdiction of the
securities covered by such registration  statement;

 

 

(v) furnish,  at the request of the selling Registrable Securities Holder(s),
on the date  that  such shares of Registrable Securities are delivered to
the underwriters for  sale  pursuant to a registration that is underwritten
or, if such Registrable  Securities are not being sold through underwriters,
on the date that the  registration statement with respect to such shares of
Registrable Securities  becomes effective, (A) an opinion, dated such date,
of the counsel representing  the Buyer for the purposes of such registration,
addressed to the underwriters,  if any, and if such Registrable Securities
are not being sold through  underwriters, then to the selling Registrable
Securities Holder(s), in customary  form and covering matters of the type
customarily covered in such legal  opinions; and (B) a comfort letter dated
such date, from the independent  certified public accountants of the Buyer,
addressed to the underwriters,  if  any, and the selling Registrable
Securities Holder(s), in a customary form  and  covering matters of the type
customarily covered by such comfort letters  and as  they shall reasonably
request;

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

21  

 

 

 

 

 

 

(vi) enter  into customary agreements (including an underwriting agreement in
customary  form, it being understood that any underwriting agreement entered
into by  the  selling Registrable Securities Holder(s) with respect to an
underwritten  offering of Registrable Securities will impose customary
indemnification  obligations on the underwriter(s)) and take such other
actions as are reasonably  required in order to expedite or facilitate the
disposition of such Registrable  Securities;

 

 

(vii) cooperate  reasonably with any managing underwriter to effect the sale
of Registrable  Securities, including but not limited to attendance of the
Buyer's executive  officers at any planned "road show" presentations to the
extent that such  attendance does not unduly or unreasonably impact the
performance of such  officer's duties;

 

 

(viii) notify  the selling Registrable Securities Holder(s) and the
underwriter(s), if any,  in  writing at any time when the Buyer is aware
that offering documents include  an  untrue statement of a material fact or
omit to state a material fact required  to  be stated therein or necessary
to make the statements therein not misleading  in  light of the
circumstances then existing, and at the request of any selling  Registrable
Securities Holder or underwriter, prepare and furnish to such  person(s) such
reasonable number of copies of any amendment or supplement  to the  offering
documents as may be necessary so that, as thereafter delivered to  the 
purchasers of such shares, such offering documents would not include any 
untrue  statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact
required to  be  stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein
not misleading  in  light of the circumstances then existing, and to deliver
to purchasers of  any  other securities of the Buyer included in the
offering copies of such offering  documents as so amended or supplemented;

 

 

(ix) promptly  notify the selling Registrable Securities Holder(s) of (A) the
effectiveness  of  such offering documents, (B) the issuance by the SEC of
an order suspending  the  effectiveness of the offering documents, or of the
threat of any proceeding  for  that purpose, and (C) the suspension of the
qualification of any securities  to  be included in the offering documents
for sale in any jurisdiction or the  initiation or threat of any proceeding
for that purpose; and

 

 

(x) cause  all  Registrable Securities to be listed on each securities
exchange on which  similar  securities issued by the Buyer are then listed.

 

 

It  shall  be a condition precedent to the obligation of the Buyer to take
any action  pursuant to this Section 6 in respect of the securities which are
to be  registered that the Registrable Securities Holder(s) shall furnish to
the  Buyer  such information regarding the securities held by the
Registrable Securities  Holder(s) and the intended method of disposition
thereof as the Buyer shall  reasonably request and as shall be required in
connection with the action  taken  by the Buyer.

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

22  

 

 

 

 

 

 

(d) _Expenses._   All  expenses incurred in complying with this Section 6
shall be paid by the Buyer,  including, without limitation, (i) all
registration and filing fees (including  all expenses incident to filing with
the NASD), (ii) all "road show" expenses  incurred by the Buyer or the
Registrable Securities Holder(s) and all applicable  selling security
holders, (iii) printing expenses, (iv) fees and expenses  of  counsel for
the Buyer, (v) the reasonable fees and expenses of one counsel  for  the
Registrable Securities Holders, (vi) expenses of any special audits incident 
to or required by any such registration, (vii) expenses of complying with 
the  securities or blue sky laws of any jurisdiction pursuant to Section
6(c)(iv)  and  (viii) any fees or disbursements of counsel for any
underwriter in respect  of  the securities sold by any applicable selling
security holders, including  the  Registrable Securities Holders, if
applicable, except that the Buyer shall  not  be liable for any fees,
discounts or commissions to any  underwriter.

 

 

(e) _Indemnification  and Contribution_.

 

 

(i) In  the  event of any registration of any Registrable Securities under
the Securities  Act  pursuant to this Agreement, the Buyer shall indemnify
and hold harmless the  Seller's Indemnitees from and against any losses,
claims, damages or  liabilities, joint or several, to which a Seller's
Indemnitee may become subject  under the Securities Act or any other statute
or at common law, insofar as  such  losses, claims, damages or liabilities
(or actions in respect thereof) arise  out  of or are based upon: (A) any
untrue statement or any alleged untrue statement  of any material fact
contained or incorporated by reference, on the effective  date thereof, in
any registration statement under which such securities were  registered under
the Securities Act, any preliminary prospectus or final  prospectus contained
therein, any free writing prospectus or any amendment  or  supplement
thereto, (B) any omission or alleged omission to state therein  a  material
fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements 
therein not misleading, or (C) any other violation of any applicable
securities  laws, and in each of the foregoing circumstances shall pay for or
reimburse  the  Seller's Indemnitees for any legal or any other expenses
reasonably incurred by  all or any one of the Seller's Indemnitees in
connection with investigating or  defending any such loss, claim, damage,
liability or action; _provided_ ,  _however_ ,  that,  with respect to any
Seller's Indemnitee, the Buyer shall not be liable in any  such case to the
extent that any such loss, claim, damage or liability has  been  found by a
court of competent jurisdiction to have been based upon any actual  untrue
statement or actual omission made or incorporated by reference in  such 
registration statement, preliminary prospectus, prospectus, free writing 
prospectus or any amendment or supplement thereto solely in reliance upon 
and in  conformity with written information furnished to the Buyer by such
Seller's  Indemnitee specifically for use therein. Such indemnity shall
remain in full  force and effect regardless of any investigation made by or
on behalf of  a  Seller's Indemnitee, and shall survive the transfer of such
securities by a  Seller's Indemnitee.

 

 

(ii) In  the  event of any registration of any Registrable Securities under
the Securities  Act  pursuant to this Agreement, the Registrable Securities
Holders, by acceptance  hereof, agree to indemnify and hold harmless the
Registration Buyer Indemnitees  against any losses, claims, damages or
liabilities, joint or several, to  which  the Registration Buyer Indemnitees
may become subject under the Securities  Act  or any other statute or at
common law, insofar as such losses, claims, damages  or liabilities (or
actions in respect thereof) arise out of or are based  upon:  (A) any untrue
statement or any alleged untrue statement of any material  fact  contained
or incorporated by reference, effective date thereof, in any  registration
statement under which such securities were registered under  the  Securities
Act, any preliminary prospectus or final prospectus contained  therein, any
free writing prospectus, or any amendment or supplement thereto,  or  (B)
any omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact required 
to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not
misleading,  but in either case only to the extent that such untrue statement
or omission  is  (1) made in reliance on and in conformity with any
information furnished  in  writing by the Seller to the Buyer concerning the
Seller specifically for  inclusion in the registration statement, preliminary
prospectus, prospectus,  free writing prospectus or any amendment or
supplement thereto relating to  such  offering, and (2) is not corrected by
the Seller and distributed to the  purchasers of shares within a reasonable
period of time.

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

23  

 

 

 

 

 

 

(iii) If  the  indemnification provided for in this Section 6 from an
indemnifying party  is  unavailable to an indemnified party hereunder in
respect of any losses, claims,  damages, liabilities or expenses referred to
therein, then the indemnifying  party, in lieu of indemnifying such
indemnified party, shall contribute to  the  amount paid or payable by such
indemnified party as a result of such losses,  claims, damages, liabilities
or expenses in such proportion as is appropriate  to  reflect the relative
fault of the indemnifying party and indemnified parties  in  connection with
the actions which resulted in such losses, claims, damages,  liabilities or
expenses, as well as any other relevant equitable considerations.  The
relative fault of such indemnifying party and indemnified parties shall  be 
determined by reference to, among other things, whether any action in
question,  including any untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material
fact or omission  or alleged omission to state a material fact, has been made
by, or relates  to  information supplied by, such indemnifying party or
indemnifying parties,  and  the parties' relative intent, knowledge, access
to information and opportunity  to correct or prevent such action. The amount
paid or payable by a party  as a  result of the losses, claims, damages,
liabilities and expenses referred  to  above shall include any legal or
other fees or expenses reasonably incurred  by  such party in connection
with any investigation or proceeding.

 

 

(iv) The  parties hereto agree that it would not be just and equitable if
contribution  pursuant to Section 6(e)(iii) were determined by pro rata
allocation or by  any  other method of allocation which does not take
account of the equitable  considerations referred to in the immediately
preceding paragraph. No person  guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation
(within the meaning of Section 11  (f) of  the Securities Act) shall be
entitled to contribution from any person who  was  not guilty of such
fraudulent misrepresentation.

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

24  

 

 

 

 

 

 

(f) _" Market  Stand-Off" Agreement_.  The  Seller (on behalf of itself and
each Registrable Securities Holder) hereby  agrees, in connection with any
firm commitment, underwritten primary public  offering by the Buyer of its
securities, that it shall not, to the extent  requested by the Buyer or a
managing underwriter of such securities, sell  or  otherwise transfer or
dispose of or engage in any other transaction regarding  any Registrable
Securities or other shares of the Buyer then owned by the  Seller  or any
Registrable Securities Holder for a period not to exceed one hundred  and 
eighty (180) days following the effective date of a registration statement 
of  the Buyer filed under the Securities Act in connection with such firm 
commitment, underwritten public offering by the Buyer.

 

 

(g) _Resale  Exemptions; Reports Under Exchange Act._ In  order  to permit
a Registrable Securities Holder to sell Registrable Securities,  if it  so
desires, pursuant to any applicable resale exemption under applicable 
securities laws and regulations, the Buyer shall:

 

 

(i) comply  with all requirements under the Securities Act and all rules and
regulations  of  the SEC thereunder in connection with use of any such
resale  exemption;

 

 

(ii) make  and  keep available adequate and current public information
regarding the  Buyer;

 

 

(iii) file  with  the SEC in a timely manner, all reports and other
documents required to be  filed  under the Securities Act, the Exchange Act,
or other applicable securities  laws  and regulations;

 

 

(iv) furnish  to the Registrable Securities Holders, upon written request,
copies of annual  reports required to be filed under the Exchange Act and
other applicable  securities laws and regulations; and

 

 

(v) furnish  to the Registrable Securities Holders, upon written request (A)
a copy of  the  most recent quarterly report of the Buyer and such other
reports and documents  filed by the Buyer with the SEC and (B) such other
information as may be  reasonably required to permit the Registrable
Securities Holders to sell  pursuant to any applicable resale exemption under
the Securities Act or other  applicable securities law and regulations, if
any.

 

 

(h) _Lock-up_.

 

 

(i) The  Seller hereby agrees that, without the prior written consent of the
Buyer,  it  (A) will not, directly or indirectly, offer, sell, agree to
offer or sell,  solicit offers to purchase, grant any call option or purchase
any put option  with respect to, or pledge, borrow or otherwise dispose of,
any of the  Registrable Securities, and (B) will not establish or increase
any "put  equivalent position" or liquidate or decrease any "call equivalent
position" with respect to such Registrable Securities (in each case within
the meaning  of  Section 16 of the Exchange Act), or otherwise enter into
any swap, derivative  or  other transaction or arrangement that transfers to
another, in whole or in  part,  any economic consequence of ownership of
such Registrable Securities, whether  or  not such transaction is to be
settled by delivery of Registrable Securities,  other securities, cash or
other consideration, in either case for a period  of  (x) one hundred and
eighty (180) days with respect to one-half of such  Registrable Securities,
and (y) three hundred and sixty five (365) days with  respect to the
remaining Registrable Securities, in each case commencing  on the  Closing
Date; **provided  that** ,  notwithstanding the foregoing, the Seller shall
be permitted to transfer  all or  any portion of the Registrable Securities
to any Seller's Affiliate;  **provided,  further, that** prior  to  any
such transfer the transferor at its expense shall provide to the Buyer  an 
opinion of counsel reasonably acceptable to the Buyer to the effect that 
such  transfer would not require registration under the Securities Act. The
Seller  hereby further agrees to cause each Registrable Securities Holder to
enter  into  a lock-up agreement giving effect to the provisions of this
Section 6(h)  immediately upon such Registrable Securities Holder's
acquisition of an  aggregate of any  Registrable Securities. The
registration of the Registrable Securities as  contemplated by Sections 6(a)
and (b) shall not be prohibited by this Section  6(h).

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

25  

 

 

 

 

 

 

(ii) The  Buyer  and EIAC shall cause each of George Sagredos  and 
Marios  Pantazopoulos to  enter  into an acknowledgment and agreement (as
required by Section 14(p)) providing  that,  without the prior written
consent of the Buyer, he  (A) will  not, directly or indirectly, offer,
sell, agree to offer or sell, solicit  offers  to purchase, grant any call
option or purchase any put option with respect  to,  or pledge, borrow or
otherwise dispose of the  1  million units of Buyer to be issued pursuant to
Section 3(c)(viii) of this  Agreement, or any of the Buyer  Common Stock or
warrants included therein,  and (B)  will not establish or increase any "put
equivalent position" or liquidate or  decrease any "call equivalent position"
with respect to 1  million  units of Buyer to be issued pursuant to Section
3(c)(viii) of this Agreement,  or  any of the Buyer Common Stock or warrants
included therein (in  each  case within the meaning of Section 16 of the
Exchange Act), or otherwise  enter  into any swap, derivative or other
transaction or arrangement that transfers  to  another, in whole or in part,
any economic consequence of ownership of the  1  million units of Buyer to
be issued pursuant to Section 3(c)(viii) of this  Agreement, or any of the
Buyer Common Stock or warrants included therein,  whether or not such
transaction is to be settled by delivery of shares of  Buyer  Common Stock
or warrants, other securities, cash or other consideration,  in  either case
for a period of one hundred and eighty (180) days commencing  on the 
Closing Date. The registration rights contemplated by Sections 6(a) and (b) 
shall not be prohibited by this Section 6(h)(ii).

 

 

(i) _Termination._   The  rights granted under this Section 6 shall expire
at the earlier of such time  as  the Registrable Securities Holders
collectively (i) hold less than five (5%)  percent of the outstanding Buyer
Common Stock, or (ii) are eligible to sell  their Registrable Securities
without restriction under Rule 144(k) promulgated  under the Securities Act
(it being agreed, for purposes of this Section 6(i),  that the Buyer, upon
the request of a Registrable Securities Holder and at  Buyer's expense, shall
provide to Buyer's transfer agent a legal opinion of its  counsel regarding
the ability of such holder to sell its Registrable Securities  under Rule
144(k) and any appropriate legend removal instructions).

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

26  

 

 

 

 

 

 

(j) _Legends._   The  Seller hereby acknowledges and agrees that the Buyer
shall legend the share  certificates representing the Registrable Securities
to reflect the restrictions  on transfer contained in this Agreement and may
issue to its transfer agent  a  stop transfer instruction in relation
thereto. Such legend shall  state:

 

 

THE  SHARES OF COMMON STOCK REPRESENTED HEREBY HAVE NOT BEEN REGISTERED
UNDER  THE  SECURITIES ACT OF 1933, AS AMENDED, OR ANY STATE SECURITIES
LAWS, AND MAY  NOT BE  SOLD, ASSIGNED, TRANSFERRED, PLEDGED, ENCUMBERED OR
OTHERWISE DISPOSED OF  IN THE  ABSENCE OF SUCH REGISTRATION OR UNLESS THE
COMPANY HAS RECEIVED AN OPINION  OF  COUNSEL SATISFACTORY TO THE COMPANY AND
ITS COUNSEL THAT SUCH TRANSACTION  IS  EXEMPT FROM, OR NOT SUBJECT TO,
REGISTRATION. THE SHARES REPRESENTED BY THIS  CERTIFICATE ARE SUBJECT TO AN
AGREEMENT BY THE REGISTERED HOLDER WITH THE  COMPANY NOT TO SELL SUCH SHARES
FOR A PERIOD OF 180 (OR 365 DAYS, AS THE  CASE  MAY BE) DAYS FOLLOWING THE
DATE OF ISSUANCE OF THE SHARES.

described in Section  7(b) or (c) may:

 

 

(i) sell  any  Dividend Waiver Securities to an unrelated third party free
of any restrictions  imposed by a Dividend Waiver Agreement, and upon such
sale, and pursuant  to the  terms of the Dividend Escrow Agreement, if 
applicable, the  Escrow Agent shall release such Dividend Waiver Securities
from escrow upon  receipt by it of the agreed consideration therefor and
shall pay to the seller  the amount of the consideration received less such
amount as would be necessary  to pay the First Year Dividend on such Dividend
Waiver Securities, which  amount  shall be retained by the Escrow Agent and
held in escrow pursuant to the  terms  of the Dividend Escrow Agreement.
Any  amounts deposited  in escrow pursuant  to this paragraph and  not 
used to pay the First Year Dividend shall be refunded, together with any 
interest accrued thereon,  to such  seller upon the payment of the First
Year Dividend; and

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

27  

 

 

 

 

 

 

(ii) exercise  any warrants, rights or other options in respect of any
Dividend Waiver  Securities, and upon notifying the Escrow Agent of such
exercise the Escrow  Agent shall promptly take all such steps as are
necessary to exercise such  warrants, rights or other options in respect of
any Dividend Waiver  Securities,  **provided  that**   any  shares of
Buyer Common Stock issuable upon any such exercise shall remain  subject to
the applicable Dividend Waiver Agreement and shall be held in  escrow  by
the Escrow Agent and pursuant to the terms of the Dividend Escrow  Agreement.

(a) Only  in  the event that the Seller obtains the Financing, and
commencing on such date,  until the termination of this Agreement pursuant to
Section 20 hereof, EIAC,  the  Buyer, their Affiliates and their respective
representatives, agents and  officers will  cease  all  activities,
discussions or negotiations with any Person or Persons other  than  the
Seller with respect to any Acquisition Proposal and in particular, EIAC 
and  the Buyer and their respective representatives, agents and officers
shall  not  take, and shall use commercially reasonable efforts to cause
their respective  Affiliates and their respective representatives, agents and
officers not  to  take, any action to:

 

 

(i) knowingly  solicit the making or submission of any Acquisition Proposal;
or

 

 

(ii) knowingly  initiate or participate in any discussions or negotiations

this  Agreement, there are no material outstanding claims under, or in

presently conducted, and no existing condition  of  the Vessels, which will
give rise to any civil or criminal liability under,  or  violate or prevent
compliance with, any health or occupational safety or  other  applicable
Law. Since the date of the most recent balance sheet included  in the 
Audited Financial Statements, none of the Seller nor any SPV has received 
any  notice in writing from any Governmental Authority revoking, canceling, 
rescinding, materially modifying or refusing to renew any Permit or
providing  written notice of violations under any Law. To the Knowledge of

requirements of the Permits  and no  Permit will require the consent of any
Governmental Authority upon the  consummation of the Sale and Purchase;

Vessel or the operation of the Business  which could reasonably be

or any Vessel or (ii) to cause such Vessel to be subject  to any restrictions
on ownership, occupancy, use or transferability under  any  applicable
Environmental Law;

 

 

(y) the  name,  official number, registered owner, and jurisdiction of
registration of each  Vessel owned by any SPV is listed in **_Schedule 
11(f)_**   hereto.  To the Knowledge of the Seller, each Vessel is operated

it under all applicable  Laws  (including the Laws of each Vessel's flag
state). Each Vessel is classed by a  classification society which is a member
of the IACS and is in class and  free of  overdue recommendations affecting
class with all class and trading certificates  valid. The Vessels are insured
in accordance with customary market practice  for  vessels of similar age
and type and as required by the Carry-Over Financing.  To  the Knowledge of
the Seller, since the date of the most recent balance sheet  included in the
Audited Financial Statements, the Vessels have not been employed  in any
trade or business which is unlawful under the laws of any jurisdiction  in 
which such Vessel is registered or trades, or in any manner whatsoever which 
may  render any such Vessel liable to condemnation in a prize court or to 
destruction, seizure or confiscation;

 

 

(z) all  of  the bank accounts, safe deposit boxes and lock boxes used by
each SPV  (designating each authorized signatory) are listed in **_Schedule 
11(y)_**.  Excepting the authorized signatories, no SPV has granted a power

considers necessary  or  appropriate to make an informed decision with
respect to the acquisition  of the  Registrable Securities;

 

 

(cc) the  Registrable Securities being acquired by it are being acquired for
its own  account for the purpose of investment and not with a view to, or for
resale  in  connection with, any distribution thereof within the meaning of
the Securities  Act, and it has no current specific plan or intention to sell
or otherwise  dispose of such Registrable Securities;

 

 

(dd) it  understands that (i) the Registrable Securities have not been
registered  under  the Securities Act by reason of their issuance in a
transaction exempt from  the  registration requirements of the Securities
Act, (ii) the Registrable Securities  must be held indefinitely (subject,
however, to the Buyer's obligation to effect  the registration of Registrable
Securities in accordance with Section 6 hereof)  unless a subsequent
disposition thereof is registered under the Securities  Act  or is exempt
from such registration, and (iii) shares of Buyer Common Stock  will  bear a
legend to such effect set forth in Section 6(j) hereof;

 

 

(ee) the  representations and warranties made by the Seller in this Section
11 are  the  exclusive representations and warranties made by the Seller and
the Seller  hereby disclaims any other express or implied representations
or  warranties;

the business  which could have a Material Adverse Effect and which have not
been disclosed  to  EIAC and the Buyer by the Seller other than normal
business or market risks  prevailing from time to time;

 

 

(gg) no  representation or warranty of the Seller in this Agreement, nor any

preemption  or  other restrictions on transfer in respect of the SPV Shares,
as provided  in  Section 3(b) of this Agreement; and

 

 

(jj) The  aggregate net amount of shareholder loans to the SPVs and inter-

49  

 

 

 

 

 

 

(b) Seller  shall cooperate with and assist EIAC and Buyer in the preparation
of the  Merger  Proxy and other documents required in connection therewith,
which cooperation  and assistance shall include, but not be limited to,
providing appropriate  representation letters, preparing and reviewing
explanations and descriptions  of  Seller's business and making available
Seller's financial and business  information required to be included in the

(including such additional audited  and  unaudited financial statements for
each SPV and other related information  with  respect to any required

related information shall be prepared at the sole cost of EIAC  and the 
Buyer).

 

 

(c) Seller  will review the Merger Proxy and other documents required in
connection  therewith to assist EIAC and Buyer in their confirmation
processes with respect  to information that Seller has provided, and will
further permit EIAC and  Buyer  to have access to such information as, in

Acquisition Registration Statement  and Resale Registration Statement, as the
case may be, do not contain any  untrue  statement of a material fact or
omit to state a material fact necessary in  order  to make the statements
contained therein not misleading.

 

 

(d) Seller  on  behalf of itself and the SPVs hereby agrees that, except for
any expenses  which  EIAC and/or the Buyer has agreed to pay under the terms
of this  Agreement  on the  earlier of the termination of this Agreement
under Section 20 and the Closing  Date,  neither  it nor any of the SPVs
shall have any right, title, interest or claim of  any  kind (each, a "
_Trust  Fund Claim_ ")  in or  to any monies that were at any time retained
in the trust fund (the " _Trust  Fund_ ")  established by EIAC for the
benefit of the public stockholders and the  underwriters of the IPO and
hereby waive any Trust Fund Claim against any  such  monies which it may
have in the future as a result of, or arising out of,  any  negotiations,
contracts or agreements with EIAC and will not for any reason  whatsoever
seek recourse against the monies that are retained in the Trust  Fund  for
such purposes. The obligations arising under this Section 16(d) shall 
survive the termination of this Agreement.

 

 

**SECTION  17. ****INDEMNITIES** **.**

 

 

(a) Subject  to the terms and conditions of this Section 17 and the Closing
having occurred,  and notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in
this Agreement,  the  Seller hereby agrees to indemnify, defend and hold
harmless the Buyer  Indemnitees from and against all Losses asserted against,
resulting to, imposed  upon, or incurred by any Buyer Indemnitee by reason
of, arising out of or  resulting from:

 

 

(i) the  inaccuracy or breach of any representation or warranty of the Seller
contained  in or made pursuant to this Agreement, any Exhibits, Schedules or
any  certificate delivered by the Seller to the Buyer pursuant to this
Agreement  with  respect hereto or thereto in connection with the Closing;

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

50  

 

 

 

 

 

 

(ii) the  non-fulfillment or breach of any agreement, covenant or undertaking
of the  Seller or any SPV contained in this Agreement or any Ancillary 
Agreement;

 

 

(iii) any  Liability (other than the Carry-Over Financing) of an SPV
attributable to  the  operations or actions of any SPV or the Seller
occurring on or prior to the  Closing Date; or

 

 

(iv) Disclosed  Legal Proceedings.

 

 

(b) The  Buyer  shall notify the Seller of any Claim for which the Seller
may have an  indemnification liability under this Agreement as soon as
reasonably possible,  giving reasonable details, provided, however, that the
failure to give such  timely notice shall not affect the Buyer's rights to
indemnification hereunder,  except to the extent the Seller is actually
prejudiced by such failure. In  the  event of a Third Party Claim, the
Seller shall have 30 days after the receipt  of  such notice to elect to
undertake, conduct and control, through counsel of  its  own choosing and at
its expense, the settlement or defense thereof, and the  Buyer shall
cooperate with the Seller in connection therewith; provided  that:

 

 

(i) the  Seller acknowledges and agrees in writing that the indemnification
provisions  of  this Section 17 apply to such Third Party Claim;

 

 

(ii) the  Seller shall permit the Buyer to participate in such settlement or
defense  through counsel chosen by the Buyer, provided that the fees and
expenses  of such  counsel shall be borne by the Buyer;

 

 

(iii) the  Seller shall keep the Buyer advised as to the current status and
progress  of  such settlement or defense;

 

 

(iv) the  Seller shall not, without the prior written consent of the Buyer
(which consent  shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed), settle or
compromise any  such  Third Party Claim or consent to the entry of any
order, judgment, injunction,  or  consent decree in respect to such Third
Party Claim; and

 

 

(v) nothing  herein shall require the Buyer to consent to any such settlement
or compromise  or to the entry of any order, judgment, injunction or consent
decree which  does  not include as an unconditional term thereof the giving
by the claimant or  plaintiff to the Buyer a release from all liability in
respect to such Third  Party Claim or which affects the ability of the Buyer
or any SPV to conduct  its  business operations after the date thereof.

 

 

So  long  as the Seller is diligently contesting any such Third Party Claim
in good  faith  (and is otherwise complying with the conditions in the
preceding sentence),  the  Buyer shall not pay or settle any such Third
Party Claim. Notwithstanding  the  foregoing, the Buyer shall have the right
to pay or settle any Third Party  Claim, provided that in such event it shall
waive any right to indemnity  therefor by the Seller. If the Seller does not
notify the Buyer within 30  days  after the receipt of the Buyer's written
notice of a Third Party Claim that it  elects to undertake the defense
thereof (or does not otherwise comply with  the  conditions set forth in
this Section 17(b)), the Buyer shall have the right  to  contest, settle or
compromise the Third Party Claim in the exercise of its  reasonable judgment
at the expense of the Seller.

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

51  

 

 

 

 

 

 

(c) Seller's  indemnity shall include all Losses arising from any demands,
claims, suits,  actions, costs of investigation, notices of violation or
noncompliance, causes  of action, proceedings and assessments made by Third
Parties whether or not  ultimately determined to be valid. Solely for the
purpose of determining  the  amount of any Losses (and not for determining
any breach) for which any Buyer  Indemnitee may be entitled to
indemnification pursuant to this Section 17,  any  Losses recoverable in
respect of a breach of representation or warranty  contained in this
Agreement that is qualified by a term or terms such as  "material" or
"materially," or any equivalent qualification shall include all  Losses that
are recoverable in respect of such breach, and not only the "material" Losses
or the Losses that relate to the part which is "material." Any  Buyer
Indemnitee seeking indemnification under this Agreement shall take  and 
shall cause its Affiliates and their respective directors and officers to 
take  all commercially reasonable steps to mitigate the amount of any Losses
upon  becoming aware of any event which would reasonably be expected to, or
does,  give  rise thereto, including incurring costs only to the minimum
extent necessary  to  remedy the breach or inaccuracy which gives rise to
such Losses.

 

 

(d) The  parties hereto acknowledge and agree that the remedies provided for
in this  Section 17 shall be their sole and exclusive remedy with respect to
any Claims  under this Agreement, except in respect of Taxes. The Buyer's
rights and  remedies under this Section 17 or any other provision of this
Agreement shall  not exclude or limit any other remedies that may be
available to it under  any  applicable law, such as (without limitation) the
right to apply to a court  of  competent authority in any jurisdiction for
relief by way of injunction or  restraining order or the right to seek
specific performance of this  Agreement.

 

 

(e) To  the  extent that a Claim indemnified by Seller under this Agreement
is in effect  paid  in full (or if payment of such Claim is otherwise
provided for to the reasonable  satisfaction of the Buyer Indemnitee) by the
Seller, the Seller (as the case  may  be) shall, to the extent permitted by
law, be subrogated to the rights and  remedies of the Buyer Indemnitee on
whose behalf such Claim was paid or provided  for (including the rights of
such Buyer Indemnitee under its insurance) with  respect to the transaction
or event giving rise to such Claim. Should the  Buyer  Indemnitee receive
any refund, reimbursement or other payment, in whole or  in  part, with
respect to any Claim paid by or on behalf of Seller, such Buyer  Indemnitee
shall promptly pay the amount so received (but not an amount in  excess of
the amount Seller has paid or caused to be paid in respect of such  Claim)
plus interest thereon to the extent that such amount reimbursed included 
such interest less any Taxes (net after adjustment) as may be required to 
be  paid with respect to such reimbursed amount.

 

 

(f) [Intentionally  omitted].

 

 

(g) Seller  shall have no liability (for indemnification or otherwise) with
respect to  any  Claim under this Agreement (except in respect to Taxes):

 

 

(i) until  the  total of all Losses with respect to such matters exceeds
$5,000,000, after  which  Seller must indemnify the Buyer Indemnitees for
the full amount of such Losses  from the first dollar of such Losses; or

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

52  

 

 

 

 

 

 

(ii) made  after the First Anniversary.

 

 

(h) Seller's  aggregate liability (for indemnification or otherwise, except
in respect  of  Taxes) with respect to Claims under this Agreement shall not
exceed $25,000,000;  _provided  that_   the  limitation provided under
this subclause (h) shall not apply to Claims made  after the Closing arising
under Section 11(a), (b), (d), (e), (f) and (i)  of  this Agreement or
related thereto or Claims resulting from or due to  fraud.

 

 

**SECTION  18. ****TAX  RETURNS AND PRE-CLOSING TAXES AND STRADDLE PERIOD
TAXES**

 

 

(a) Notwithstanding  any provision of this Agreement to the contrary, all
rights and remedies  of the  parties relating to Pre-Closing Taxes and
Straddle Period Taxes, Losses arising  from such Taxes and any other matter
relating to such Taxes are set forth  exclusively in this Section 18. The
sole remedies, rights of payments and  damages available with respect to such
Taxes, Losses arising from such Taxes  and  any other matter relating to
such Taxes are those set forth in this Section  18.

 

 

(b) The  Seller shall be liable for, and, subject to the provisions of this
Section  18,  shall pay, indemnify and hold harmless the Buyer Indemnitees,
on an after-tax  basis, against any and all Pre-Closing Taxes and any Losses
arising from  Pre-Closing Taxes. Seller shall be liable for, and subject to
the provisions  of  this Section 18, shall pay, indemnify and hold harmless
the Buyer Indemnitees,  on an after-tax basis, against Seller's Portion of
any Straddle Period Taxes  (including any amounts paid to Seller under
Section 18(j)) in excess of the  Reserved Tax Liability and any Losses
arising therefrom.

 

 

(c) The  Seller shall have exclusive authority subject to the provisions of
this Section  18 to prepare and file or cause to be prepared and filed all
Pre-Closing  Tax  Returns for each SPV, including any Estimated Tax Returns
due on or prior  to the  Closing Date.

 

 

(d) The  Seller shall prepare and duly and timely file or cause to be
prepared and  duly  and timely filed all Pre-Closing Tax Returns for all
SPVs. Each such Tax  Return  shall be true, correct and complete, shall be
prepared in the same manner  as the  Tax Returns of the SPVs for the
immediately preceding taxable year or period,  and shall not make, amend or
terminate any election without the prior written  consent of the Buyer (which
consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or  delayed). The Seller shall
duly and timely pay the Tax shown to be due on  each  such Tax Return.
Promptly after the filing of each such Tax Return, Seller  shall  provide
Buyer with a copy of the Tax Return, together with proof of the payment  of
the Tax shown thereon to be due.

 

 

(e) The  Buyer  shall prepare (in accordance with the past practices of the
relevant SPV,  except  to the extent required by law) the initial draft of
all Straddle Period Tax  Returns (other than Estimated Tax Returns due on or
prior to the Closing  Date)  of each of the SPVs and shall submit such Tax
Returns, along with a calculation  of the Seller's Portion of any Straddle
Period Taxes relating to such Tax  Returns (net of the Reserved Tax Liability
for the relevant SPV and net of  any  Prepaid Taxes related to such Straddle
Period Taxes), to the Seller for its  approval no later than thirty (30) days
prior to the due date thereof. No  later  than ten (10) days after the
receipt of such Tax Return from the Buyer, the  Seller shall notify the Buyer
of any reasonable objections the Seller may  have  to items set forth in
such draft Tax Returns and/or the calculation of the  Sellers Portion of
Straddle Period Taxes for which the Seller is responsible.  The Buyer and
Seller agree to consult and resolve in good faith any such  objections, it
being understood and agreed that in the absence of any such  resolution, any
and all such objections shall be in a manner consistent with  the  past
practices with respect to such items unless otherwise required by  law.

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

53  

 

 

 

 

 

 

If  the  Seller and the Buyer cannot resolve any and all objections by the
fifteenth  (15th)  day  prior to the due date of the Straddle Period Tax
Returns that are the subject  of  the dispute, the issue involved shall be
submitted to an independent public  accounting firm acceptable to both the
Seller and the Buyer; provided, however,  that if the dispute or disagreement
involves a matter of legal interpretation,  then upon the written consent of
both parties (which shall not be unreasonably  withheld or delayed by either
of them), such dispute shall be resolved by  such  independent public
accounting firm, provided that in the absence of such  written  consent,
such independent accounting firm shall select an outside attorney  (1) 
experienced in the relevant tax law and (2) mutually acceptable to the
Seller  and the Buyer (which acceptance shall not be unreasonably withheld or
delayed  by  either of them) to resolve such dispute or disagreement. If the
Seller and  the  Buyer cannot agree on an independent public accounting
firm, the first Big  Four  Public Accounting Firm (on an alphabetical basis)
that is not currently serving  as the auditor of the Seller or the Buyer
shall be selected to resolve the  dispute. The Seller and the Buyer shall
provide all necessary information  to the  independent accounting firm (or
any outside attorney selected by such accounting  firm), and shall instruct
the independent accounting firm (or outside attorney  selected by such
accounting firm) to resolve the dispute, to the extent  reasonably possible,
no later than five 5 days prior to the due date of such  Tax  Returns. The
decision of the independent public accounting firm (and any  outside 
attorney selected by such accounting firm) in resolving the dispute shall 
be  final and binding. The fees and expenses incurred with respect to the 
independent public accounting firm resolving the dispute shall be allocated 
fifty percent (50%) to the Seller and fifty percent (50%) to the Buyer. All 
other fees and expenses incurred in resolving the dispute shall be borne  by
the  party hereto that incurs such fees and expenses.

 

 

Not  later  than three (3) days prior to the due date of the Straddle Period
Tax Returns,  the Seller shall pay to the Buyer the Seller's Portion of
Straddle Period Taxes  in respect to such Tax Returns if such calculation
shall not then be in dispute,  provided that if any amount involved in such
calculation shall then be in  dispute under the provisions of the preceding
paragraph, Seller shall pay  to  Buyer the amount in dispute, upon receipt
of a written acknowledgement by  the  Buyer that it will repay to Seller any
such amount promptly after a  determination pursuant to the provisions of the
preceding paragraph that  Seller  does not owe such amount.

 

 

(f) For  purposes of this Agreement, Taxes related to a Straddle Period shall
be  apportioned to the Seller (" _Seller 's  Portion_")  for  the period
up to and including the close of the Closing Date and to the Buyer  (" _Buyer
's  Portion_")  for  the period subsequent to the Closing Date, determined
as follows:

 

 

(i) in  the  case of real property and personal property Taxes on a per-diem
basis;  and

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

54  

 

 

 

 

 

 

(ii) otherwise,  as determined from the books and records of the relevant SPV
as though the  taxable year of the SPV had terminated as of the close on the
Closing Date  but  apportioning any annual exemption amount based on the
relative number of  days in  the portion of the Straddle Period through and
including the Closing Date  and in  the balance of the Straddle Period.

 

 

For  avoidance of doubt, Seller's Portion of any Straddle Period Taxes shall
be  determined without regard to any Prepaid Taxes or Reserved Tax 
Liability.

 

 

(g) The  Buyer  shall have exclusive authority to prepare and file or cause
to be prepared  and  filed all Tax Returns for all SPVs for all tax
reporting periods that begin  on  or after the Closing Date. Notwithstanding
any provision of this Agreement  to  the contrary, Buyer or any of its
nominated subsidiaries also shall have  exclusive authority to make a Section
338 Election in respect to the acquisition  of the SPV Shares hereunder and
to prepare and file or cause to be prepared  and  filed all Tax Returns in
connection therewith.

 

 

(h) The  Seller and the Buyer agree that Tax Returns that would otherwise be
filed  for  tax periods that begin on or prior to the Closing Date and which
would otherwise  end after the Closing Date will reflect a short taxable year
for any SPV  ending  on the Closing Date in any federal, state, local or
foreign taxing jurisdiction  in which such tax year is allowed by
administrative practice, whether or  not  required by law.

 

 

(i) Each  of  the Buyer and Seller shall bear all costs incurred in
preparing and filing  the  Tax Returns that such party is responsible to
prepare and file under this  Agreement.

 

 

(j) To  the  extent that the Reserved Tax Liability shall exceed the
Seller's Portion of the  Straddle Period Taxes (as determined under this
Section 18), the Buyer shall  pay  the Seller such excess at the same time
as the related Straddle Period Tax  Return is filed.

 

 

(k) The  Buyer  shall promptly notify the Seller in writing upon receipt by
the Buyer or  any  Affiliate of the Buyer (including any SPV) of any
communication with respect  to  any Tax Matter (or pending or threatened Tax
Matter) relating to any Tax  period  beginning before the Closing Date. The
Buyer shall include with such  notification a complete copy of any written
communication received by the  Buyer  or any affiliate of the Buyer in
respect of such Tax Matter.

 

 

(l) The  Seller shall have the sole right to represent the interests of the
any SPA,  and  the right to employ counsel of its choice at its expense and
to make decisions  with respect to negotiation, contest or settlements in any
Tax Matter relating  to any Pre-Closing Tax Returns for any SPV, provided
that (i) the Seller  acknowledges and agrees in writing that the
indemnification provisions of  this  Section 18 apply to the Pre-Closing
Taxes in dispute, (ii) the Seller shall  permit the Buyer to participate in
such settlement or defense through counsel  chosen by the Buyer and at the
Buyer's expense, (iii) Seller shall keep the  Buyer advised as to the current
status and progress of such settlement or  defense, and (iv) the Seller shall
not, without the prior written consent  of the  Buyer (which shall not be
unreasonably withheld or delayed) settle or compromise  any such Tax Matter
if any such settlement or compromise could affect any  tax  period other
than a Pre-Closing Tax Period.

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

55  

 

 

 

 

 

 

(m) The  Buyer  and Seller shall jointly represent the interests of any SPV,
and shall jointly  employ mutually agreed counsel (with expenses divided in
the proportions  that  the Seller's Portion and the Buyer's Portion are of
the relevant Straddle Period  Tax) and shall jointly make decisions with
respect to negotiation, contest  or  settlements in any Tax Matter related
to any Straddle Period Tax  Return.

 

 

(n) Beginning  on the Closing Date, each of the Seller and the Buyer, on
behalf of itself  and  each Affiliate, respectively, agrees to use good
faith efforts to provide  the  other party hereto with such cooperation or
information as such other party  hereto reasonably shall request in
connection with the determination of any  payment or any calculations
described in this Agreement and the preparation  or  filing of any Pre-
Closing Tax Return or Straddle Period Tax Return. Such  cooperation and
information shall include preparing and submitting to the  Seller  (in a
time frame consistent with past practice), at Buyer's expense (other than 
Out-of-Pocket Expenses, which shall be paid by the Seller) all information 
within the control or possession of Buyer, any SPV or any Affiliate of any 
of  them that the Seller shall reasonably request, in such form as the
Seller  shall  reasonably request, to enable the Seller to prepare any Tax
Returns required  to  be filed by the Seller pursuant to this Section 18.

 

 

(o) Any  request for information or documents pursuant to this Section 18
shall be  made  by the requesting party in writing. The other party hereto
shall use reasonable  efforts to promptly provide the requested information.
Except as otherwise  provided in this Agreement, the requesting party shall
reimburse the other  party  for any Out-of-Pocket Expenses incurred by such
party in connection with  providing any information or documentation pursuant
to this clause (o). Upon  reasonable notice, each of the Seller and the Buyer
(at its own expense other  than Out-of-Pocket Expenses, which will be paid by
the Seller) shall make  its,  or shall cause its Affiliates, as applicable,
to make their, employees and  facilities available on a mutually convenient
basis to provide explanation  of  any documents or information provided
hereunder. Any information obtained  under  this provision shall be kept
confidential, except as otherwise reasonably  may be  necessary in
connection with the filing of Tax Returns or in conducting any  Tax  Matter.

 

 

(p) For  at  least three (3) years following the Closing Date, each party
hereto will  retain  such records, documents, accounting data and other
information (including  computer data) in its possession in the ordinary
course of business reasonably  necessary for (i) the preparation and filing
of all Pre-Closing Tax Returns  and  Straddle Period Tax Returns required to
be filed by, on behalf of, or with  respect to another party hereto, and (ii)
any Tax Matters relating to such  Pre-Closing Tax Returns, Straddle Period
Tax Returns, or to any Pre-Closing  Taxes payable by, on behalf of, or with
respect to, another party  hereto.
