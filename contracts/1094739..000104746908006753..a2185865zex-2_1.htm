            AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER

  

 THIS AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER is made and entered into as of May 15, 2008 by and among Finisar Corporation, a Delaware corporation (" _Finisar_ "), Fig Combination Corporation, a Delaware corporation and a wholly-owned subsidiary of Finisar (" _Sub_ "), and Optium Corporation, a Delaware corporation (" _Optium_ "). 

  

RECITALS

  

 A. The Boards of Directors of Finisar, Sub and Optium deem it advisable and in the best interests of each corporation and its respective stockholders that Finisar and Optium combine in order to advance the long-term business interests of Finisar and Optium; 

   

 B. The combination of Finisar and Optium shall be effected by the terms of this Agreement through a transaction in which Sub will merge with and into Optium (the " _Merger_ "); 

  

 C. Contemporaneously with the execution and delivery of this Agreement, and as a condition and inducement to Finisar\'s willingness to enter into this Agreement, certain stockholders of Optium have entered into Voting Agreements in the form attached hereto as _Exhibit A_ pursuant to which they have agreed to vote their shares in favor of the adoption and approval of the Merger (the " _Optium Voting Agreements_ "); 

   

 D. Contemporaneously with the execution and delivery of this Agreement, and as a condition and inducement to Optium\'s willingness to enter into this Agreement, certain stockholders of Finisar have entered into Voting Agreements in the form attached hereto as _Exhibit B_ pursuant to which they have agreed to vote their shares in favor of the adoption and approval of the Merger (the " _Finisar Voting Agreements_ "); and 

  

 E. For U.S. federal income tax purposes, it is intended that the Merger shall qualify as a tax-free reorganization within the meaning of Section 368(a)(1)(A) and (2)(E) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the " _Code_ "). 

  

 NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing and the respective representations, warranties, covenants and agreements set forth below, the parties agree as follows: 

  

ARTICLE I 
 THE MERGER

  

 Section 1.1 _ Effective Time of the Merger._ Subject to the provisions of this Agreement, a certificate of merger (the " _Certificate of Merger_ ") in such form as is required by the relevant provisions of the Delaware General Corporation Law (the " _DGCL_ ") shall be duly prepared and executed by the Surviving Corporation (as defined in Section 1.3) and thereafter delivered to the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware for filing, as provided in the DGCL, on the Closing Date (as defined in Section 1.2). The Merger shall become effective upon the filing of the Certificate of Merger with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware or at such later time as is agreed to by the parties and set forth in the Certificate of Merger (the " _Effective Time_ "). 

  

 Section 1.2 _ Closing._ The closing of the Merger (the " _Closing_ ") will take place at 1:00 p.m., Pacific Time, on a date to be specified by Finisar and Optium, which shall be no later than the first business day after satisfaction of the latest to occur of the conditions set forth in Sections 7.1, 7.2(b) (other than the delivery of the officers\' certificate referred to therein) and 7.3(b) (other than the delivery of the officers\' certificate referred to therein), provided that the other closing conditions set forth in Article VII have been satisfied or waived as provided in Article VII at or prior to the Closing (the " _Closing Date_ "), at the offices of DLA Piper US LLP, 2000 University Avenue, Palo Alto, CA 94303, unless another date or place is agreed to in writing by Finisar and Optium. 

        

 Section 1.3 _ Effects of the Merger._ 

  

 (a) At the Effective Time (i) Sub shall be merged with and into Optium, the separate existence of Sub shall cease and Optium shall continue as the surviving corporation (Sub and Optium are sometimes referred to below as the " _Constituent Corporations_ " and Optium is sometimes referred to below as the " _Surviving Corporation_ "), (ii) the Certificate of Incorporation of Optium, as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time (the " _Certificate of Incorporation_ "), shall be amended in its entirety to read as set forth on _Exhibit C_ hereto and, as so amended, shall be the Certificate of Incorporation of the Surviving Corporation until amended as provided by Law (as defined in Section 9.3) and such Certificate of Incorporation, and (iii) the Bylaws of Optium as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be amended and restated to conform to the Bylaws of Sub as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time. 

  

 (b) At and after the Effective Time, the effects of the Merger shall be as provided in the applicable provisions of the DGCL. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, and subject thereto, at the Effective Time, all property, rights, privileges, powers and franchises of Optium and Sub shall vest in the Surviving Corporation, and all debts, liabilities and duties of Optium and Sub shall become the debts, liabilities and duties of the Surviving Corporation. 

   

 Section 1.4 _ Directors and Officers._ The directors and officers of Sub immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be the initial directors and officers of the Surviving Corporation, each of whom will hold office in accordance with the Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws of the Surviving Corporation. 

  

ARTICLE II 
 CONVERSION OF SECURITIES

  

 Section 2.1 _ Conversion of Capital Stock._ As of the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of any holder of any shares of Common Stock, $.0001 par value, of Optium (" _Optium Common Stock_ ") or the holder of capital stock of Sub: 

  

  

 (a) _ Cancellation of Treasury Stock and Finisar-Owned Stock._ Any shares of Optium Common Stock that are held by Optium or any wholly-owned Subsidiary (as defined in Section 9.3) of Optium or held in Optium\'s treasury and any shares of Optium Common Stock that are owned by Finisar, Sub or any other wholly-owned Subsidiary of Finisar shall be cancelled and retired and shall cease to exist, and no stock of Finisar or other consideration shall be delivered in exchange therefor. 

   

 (b) _ Conversion of Optium Common Stock._ Subject to Section 2.2, each issued and outstanding share of Optium Common Stock (other than shares to be cancelled in accordance with Section 2.1(a)) shall be converted into the right to receive 6.262 fully paid and nonassessable shares of Common Stock, $.001 par value, of Finisar (" _Finisar Common Stock_ ") (the " _Exchange Ratio_ "). The Exchange Ratio shall be adjusted, as appropriate, to reflect any stock split, stock dividend or similar transaction effected with respect to Finisar Common Stock or Optium Common Stock between the date hereof and the Effective Time. All such shares of Optium Common Stock, when so converted, shall no longer be outstanding and shall automatically cease to exist, and each holder of a certificate representing any such shares shall cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except the right to receive the shares of Finisar Common Stock, and any cash in lieu of fractional shares of Finisar Common Stock, to be issued or paid in consideration therefor upon the surrender of such certificate in accordance with Section 2.2, without interest. 

  

 (c) _ Sub Common Stock._ Each issued and outstanding share of the common stock, $.001 par value, of Sub (" _Sub Common Stock_ ") shall be converted into one share of common stock of the Surviving Corporation. 

  

      

  

 (d) _ Optium Stock Options, RSUs and Warrants._ At the Effective Time, all then outstanding options to purchase Optium Common Stock (each an " _Optium Option_ ") issued under Optium\'s 2006 Stock Option and Incentive Plan and related Israeli Addendum to such plan and Optium\'s 2000 Stock Incentive Plan (collectively, the " _Optium Option Plans_ "), all then outstanding restricted stock units (" _RSUs_ ") representing the right to receive at a future date or dates shares of Optium Common Stock (each an " _Optium RSU Award_ "), and all then outstanding warrants to purchase Optium Common Stock (each an " _Optium Warrant_ "), not exercised as of the Effective Time will be assumed by Finisar in accordance with Section 6.13. 

  

  

 Section 2.2 _ Exchange of Certificates._ The procedures for exchanging outstanding shares of Optium Common Stock for Finisar Common Stock pursuant to the Merger are as follows: 

  

  

 (a) _ Exchange Agent; Deposit of Exchange Fund._ On or prior to the Closing Date, Finisar shall select a reputable bank or trust company reasonably acceptable to Optium (the " _Exchange Agent_ "). At or as promptly as practicable (and in any event within two (2) business days) after the Effective Time, Finisar shall deposit with the Exchange Agent, for the benefit of the holders of shares of Optium Common Stock, for exchange for their shares of Optium Common Stock in accordance with this Section 2.2 (i) certificates evidencing the shares of Finisar Common Stock issuable pursuant to Section 2.1(b) and (ii) cash in an amount sufficient to permit payment of cash in lieu of fractional shares pursuant to Section 2.2(f), together with any dividends or distributions with respect thereto (such shares and cash, the " _Exchange Fund_ "). 

  

 (b) _ Exchange Procedures._ As soon as reasonably practicable after the Effective Time, the Exchange Agent shall mail to each holder of record of a certificate or certificates which immediately prior to the Effective Time represented outstanding shares of Optium Common Stock (each a " _Certificate_ " and, collectively, the " _Certificates_ ") whose shares were converted pursuant to Section 2.1 into the right to receive shares of Finisar Common Stock (i) a letter of transmittal (which shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the Certificates shall pass, only upon delivery of the Certificates to the Exchange Agent and shall be in such form and have such other provisions as Finisar and Optium may reasonably specify) and (ii) instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the Certificates in exchange for certificates representing shares of Finisar Common Stock. Upon surrender of a Certificate for cancellation to the Exchange Agent or to such other agent or agents as may be appointed by Finisar, together with such letter of transmittal, duly executed, the holder of such Certificate shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor (A) a certificate representing the number of whole shares of Finisar Common Stock to which the holder is entitled pursuant to Section 2.1(b) and (B) cash (without interest) in lieu of fractional shares as provided in Section 2.2(f). The Certificate so surrendered shall immediately be cancelled. In the event of a transfer of ownership of Optium Common Stock which is not registered in the transfer records of Optium, a certificate representing the proper number of shares of Finisar Common Stock to which the registered holder is entitled may be issued to a transferee if the Certificate representing such Optium Common Stock is presented to the Exchange Agent, accompanied by all documents required to evidence and effect such transfer and by evidence that any applicable stock transfer taxes have been paid. Until surrendered as contemplated by this Section 2.2, each Certificate shall be deemed at any time after the Effective Time to represent only the right to receive upon such surrender the certificate representing shares of Finisar Common Stock (and cash in lieu of any fractional shares of Finisar Common Stock as contemplated by this Section 2.2). 

  

 (c) _ Lost, Destroyed or Stolen Certificates._ The instructions for effecting the surrender of the Certificates shall set forth procedures that must be taken by the holder of any Certificate that has been lost, destroyed or stolen. It shall be a condition to the right of such holder to receive a certificate representing shares of Finisar Common Stock as set forth in Section 2.2(b) that the Exchange Agent shall have received, along with the letter of transmittal, a duly executed lost 

  

      

  
  

certificate affidavit, including an agreement to indemnify Finisar, signed
exactly as the name or names of the registered holder or holders appeared on
the books of Finisar immediately prior to the Effective Time, together with
(i) such reasonable bond in an amount as Finisar or the Exchange Agent may
reasonably request and (ii) such other documents as Finisar or the Exchange
Agent may reasonably require in connection therewith.

  

 (d) _ Distributions with Respect to Unexchanged Shares._ No dividends or other distributions declared or made after the Effective Time with respect to Finisar Common Stock with a record date after the Effective Time shall be paid to the holder of any unsurrendered Certificate with respect to the shares of Finisar Common Stock represented thereby and no cash payment in lieu of fractional shares shall be paid to any such holder pursuant to Section 2.2(f) until the holder of record of such Certificate shall surrender such Certificate. Subject to the effect of applicable Law, following surrender of any such Certificate, there shall be paid to the record holder of the certificates representing whole shares of Finisar Common Stock issued in exchange therefor, without interest, (i) at the time of such surrender, the amount of any cash payable in lieu of a fractional share of Finisar Common Stock to which such holder is entitled pursuant to Section 2.2(f) and the amount of dividends or other distributions with a record date after the Effective Time previously paid with respect to such whole shares of Finisar Common Stock, and (ii) at the appropriate payment date, and without duplicating any payment made under clause (i) above, the amount of dividends or other distributions with a record date after the Effective Time but prior to surrender and a payment date subsequent to surrender payable with respect to such whole shares of Finisar Common Stock. 

  

 (e) _ No Further Ownership Rights in Optium Common Stock._ The shares of Finisar Common Stock issued upon the surrender for exchange of shares of Optium Common Stock in accordance with the terms hereof (including any cash paid pursuant to Sections 2.2(d) or (f)) shall be deemed to have been issued in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to such shares of Optium Common Stock, subject, however, to the Surviving Corporation\'s obligation to pay any dividends or make any other distributions with a record date prior to the Effective Time which may have been declared or made by Optium on such shares of Optium Common Stock in accordance with the terms of this Agreement on or prior to the date hereof and which remain unpaid at the Effective Time, and there shall be no further registration of transfers on the stock transfer books of the Surviving Corporation of the shares of Optium Common Stock which were outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time. If, after the Effective Time, Certificates are presented to the Surviving Corporation for any reason, they shall be cancelled and exchanged as provided in this Section 2.2. 

  

 (f) _ No Fractional Shares._ No certificate or scrip representing fractional shares of Finisar Common Stock shall be issued upon the surrender for exchange of Certificates, and such fractional share interests will not entitle the owner thereof to vote or to any rights of a stockholder of Finisar. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, each holder of shares of Optium Common Stock exchanged pursuant to the Merger who would otherwise have been entitled to receive a fraction of a share of Finisar Common Stock (after taking into account all Certificates delivered by such holder) shall receive, in lieu thereof, cash to the nearest whole cent (without interest) in an amount equal to such fractional part of a share of Finisar Common Stock multiplied by the last reported sale price of Finisar Common Stock, as reported on the NASDAQ Global Select Market, on the last trading day immediately preceding the date of the Effective Time. The parties acknowledge that payment of cash consideration in lieu of issuing fractional shares of Finisar Common Stock was not separately bargained for consideration but represents merely a mechanical rounding off for purposes of simplifying the administrative burden that would otherwise be caused by the issuance of fractional shares of Finisar Common Stock. 

  

      

  

 (g) _ Termination of Exchange Fund._ Any portion of the Exchange Fund which remains undistributed to the stockholders of Optium one hundred eighty (180) days after the Effective Time shall be delivered to Finisar, upon demand, and any stockholders of Optium who have not previously complied with this Section 2.2 shall thereafter look only to Finisar for payment of their claim for shares of Finisar Common Stock (including cash in lieu of any fractional shares), and any dividends or distributions with respect to Finisar Common Stock. 

  

 (h) _ No Liability._ To the fullest extent permitted by applicable Law, neither Finisar nor the Surviving Corporation shall be liable to any holder of shares of Optium Common Stock or Finisar Common Stock, as the case may be, for the delivery of such shares (or cash in lieu of fractional shares or dividends or distributions with respect thereto) to a public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar Law. 

  

 (i) _ Withholding._ Each of Finisar, the Surviving Corporation and the Exchange Agent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the consideration otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement to any holder of Optium Common Stock such amounts as are required to be deducted or withheld under the Code or any provision of state, local or foreign Tax Law with respect to the making of such payment (including withholding shares of Finisar Common Stock). Any such withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the holder of Optium Common Stock in respect of whom such deduction and withholding was made. 

  

  

 Section 2.3 _ Tax Consequences._ It is intended by the parties hereto that, for U.S. federal income tax purposes, the Merger shall constitute a reorganization within the meaning of Section 368(a)(1)(A) and (2)(E) of the Code and this Agreement shall constitute a "plan of reorganization" within the meaning of United States Treasury Regulations Sections 1.368-2(g) and 1.368-3(a). 

  

ARTICLE III 
 REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF OPTIUM

  

 As an inducement for Finisar and Sub to enter into this Agreement, Optium makes the following representations and warranties to Finisar and Sub, subject to the exceptions set forth in the disclosure schedule delivered by Optium to Finisar on or before the date of this Agreement (the " _Optium Disclosure Schedule_ "). The Optium Disclosure Schedule shall be arranged in paragraphs corresponding to the numbered and lettered Sections and subsections of this Article III; _provided_ ,  _however_ , that a matter disclosed in reference to any particular Section or subsection will be deemed to be disclosed for purposes of any other Sections or subsections of this Agreement, even if there is no express cross-reference, if the matter is disclosed in such a way to make its relevance to such other Sections or subsections readily apparent. 

  

 Section 3.1 _ Organization and Good Standing._ 

   

 (a) Optium and each of its Subsidiaries is a corporation or other legal entity duly organized, validly existing and in good standing under the Law of the jurisdiction of its organization, has all requisite corporate power to own, lease and operate its property and to carry on its business as now being conducted. Neither Optium nor any of its Subsidiaries is in violation of any of the provisions of its respective certificate of incorporation or bylaws or equivalent organizational documents. Optium and each of its Subsidiaries is duly qualified to do business and is in good standing as a foreign corporation in each other jurisdiction in which the failure to be so qualified would have a Material Adverse Effect (as defined in Section 9.3) on Optium. Optium has made available to Finisar a true, accurate and complete copy of the certificate of incorporation and bylaws or equivalent organizational documents, as applicable, of Optium and each of its Subsidiaries, each as amended to date (the " _Optium Charter Documents_ "), and each Optium Charter Document is in full force and effect, has not been amended or modified and has not been terminated, superseded or revoked.

confidentiality agreement with terms no less favorable to Optium than those
contained in the Mutual Non-Disclosure Agreement dated as of July 19, 2007
between Finisar and Optium (the " _Confidentiality Agreement_ ") and all
information delivered to such person or entity that has not previously been
made available to Finisar is made available to Finisar at the same time it is
made available to such person or entity.

  

 (b) Optium shall notify Finisar no later than twenty-four (24) hours after receipt by Optium (or its advisors) of any Optium Acquisition Proposal or any request for nonpublic information in connection with an Optium Acquisition Proposal or for access to the properties, books or records of Optium by any person or entity that informs Optium that it is considering making, or has made, an Optium Acquisition Proposal. Such notice shall be made orally and in writing and shall indicate in reasonable detail the identity of the offeror and the terms and conditions of such proposal, inquiry or contact. 

  

 (c) Except as specifically permitted in Section 6.1(a), Optium shall, and shall cause each of its Subsidiaries and Representatives to, immediately cease and terminate any existing solicitations, discussions, negotiations or other activity with any third party with respect to any Optium Acquisition Proposal or which could reasonably be expected to lead to an Optium Acquisition Proposal, and shall inform its Subsidiaries and Representatives which are engaged in any such solicitations, discussions, negotiations or other activity of Optium\'s obligations under this Section 6.1.

 (i) At any time prior to the receipt of the Optium Stockholder Approval, the Optium Board of Directors may, in response to an Optium Acquisition Proposal that the Optium Board of Directors determines in good faith (after consultation with its outside counsel and its financial advisor) constitutes an Optium Superior Proposal and that was unsolicited and made after the date hereof and that did not otherwise result from a breach of this Section 6.1, make an Optium Board Recommendation Change if the Optium Board of Directors has concluded in good faith, after consultation with its outside counsel, that, in light of such Optium Superior Proposal, the failure of the Optium Board of Directors to effect a Optium Board Recommendation Change and/or terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 8.1(f) would result in a breach of its fiduciary duties under applicable Law; _provided, however,_ that Optium shall not be entitled to exercise its right to make an Optium Board Recommendation Change pursuant to this sentence unless Optium has: (A) provided to Finisar three (3) business days\' prior written notice (such notice, a " _Notice of Optium Superior Proposal_ "), which notice shall not be deemed to be an Optium Board 

  

      

  

Recommendation Change, advising Finisar that the Optium Board of Directors
intends to take such action and specifying the reasons therefore, including
the then current material terms and conditions of any Optium Superior
Proposal that is the basis of the proposed action by the Optium Board of
Directors and the identity of the Person making the proposal (it being
understood and agreed that any material amendment to any term of any such
Optium Superior Proposal shall require a new Notice of Optium Superior
Proposal and a new three (3) business day period), (B) during such three (3)
business day period if requested by Finisar, Optium engaged in good faith
negotiations with Finisar to amend this Agreement in such a manner that any
Optium Acquisition Proposal which was determined to constitute an Optium
Superior Proposal no longer is an Optium Superior Proposal and (C) at the end
of such period such Optium Acquisition Proposal has not been withdrawn
and continues to constitute an Optium Superior Proposal (taking into account
any changes to the terms of this Agreement proposed by Finisar following a
Notice of Optium Superior Proposal, as a result of the negotiations required
by clause (B) or otherwise).

  

 (ii) Nothing contained in this Section 6.1(d) shall be deemed to (A) affect any other obligation of Optium under this Agreement (other than the obligation to recommend this Agreement set forth in Section 6.7) or (B) except upon a termination of this Agreement pursuant to Section 8.1, limit Optium\'s obligation to call, give notice of, convene and hold the Stockholder Meeting of Optium, regardless of whether the Optium Board of Directors has effected an Optium Board Recommendation Change.

 (i) " _Optium Acquisition Proposal_ " means (A) any proposal, indication of interest or offer with respect to a merger, consolidation, dissolution, liquidation, tender offer, recapitalization, reorganization, share exchange, business combination or similar transaction involving Optium or any of its Significant Subsidiaries (as defined in Section 9.3) or (B) any proposal or offer to acquire in any manner, directly or indirectly, 10% or more of the total voting power or of any class of equity securities of Optium or those of any of its Subsidiaries, or 10% or more of the consolidated total assets (including, without limitation, equity securities of its Subsidiaries) of Optium, in each case other than the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. 

  

 (ii) " _Optium Superior Proposal_ " means an unsolicited bona fide Optium Acquisition Proposal involving the acquisition of substantially all of the assets (on a consolidated basis) or more than 50% of the total voting power of the equity securities of Optium that the Optium Board of Directors determines in good faith, after consultation with Optium\'s outside legal counsel and financial advisor, to be more favorable from a financial point of view to the Optium stockholders than the Merger, taking into account all financial, regulatory, legal and other aspects of such Optium Acquisition Proposal including, without limitation, the likelihood of consummation in light of, among other things, whether or not fully committed financing is available.

any time prior to receipt of the Finisar Stockholder Approval, providing non-
public information to, or engaging or participating in discussions or
negotiations with, any person or entity in connection with an unsolicited
bona fide written Finisar Acquisition Proposal by such person or entity, if
and only to the extent that (A) the Board of Directors of Finisar (after
consultation with its financial advisors and outside legal counsel) determines
in good faith that such Finisar Acquisition Proposal, if accepted, is
reasonably likely to be consummated, taking into account all financial,
legal, regulatory and other aspects of such Finisar Acquisition Proposal and
the person making it, and that such Finisar Acquisition Proposal constitutes
or is reasonably likely to lead to a Finisar Superior Proposal (as defined in
Section 6.2(e)(ii)), (B) the Board of Directors of Finisar determines in good
faith (after consultation with and based upon the advice of outside legal
counsel) that failure to take such action would constitute a breach of the
Finisar Board of Directors\' fiduciary duties under applicable Law and (C)
prior to providing such non-public information to, or entering into
discussions or negotiations with, such person or entity, the Finisar Board of
Directors receives from such person or entity an executed confidentiality
agreement with terms no less favorable to Finisar than those contained in the

 (c) Except as specifically permitted in Section 6.2(a), Finisar shall, and shall cause each of its Subsidiaries and Representatives to, immediately cease and terminate any existing solicitations, discussions, negotiations or other activity with any third party with respect to any Finisar Acquisition Proposal or which could reasonably be expected to lead to a Finisar Acquisition Proposal, and shall inform its Subsidiaries and Representatives which are engaged in any such solicitations, discussions, negotiations or other activity of Finisar\'s obligations under this Section 6.2. Finisar shall promptly inform its Representatives who have been involved with or otherwise providing assistance in connection with the negotiation of this Agreement and the transactions contemplated by this Agreement of Finisar\'s obligations under this Section 6.2. Finisar shall promptly demand that any third party (and the legal, financial or other Representatives of any such third party) who has heretofore executed a confidentiality agreement with or for the benefit of Finisar or any of its Subsidiaries with respect to such party\'s consideration of a possible Finisar Acquisition Proposal promptly return or destroy (and Finisar shall use commercially reasonable efforts to cause any such destruction to be certified in writing by any such third party to Finisar) all confidential information heretofore made available by Finisar or any of its Subsidiaries or any of their legal, financial or other Representatives to such party or any of its legal, financial or other Representatives in accordance with the terms of the confidentiality agreement with such party.

Upon reasonable notice, Optium and Finisar shall each (and shall cause each of its Subsidiaries to) afford to the officers, employees, accountants, counsel and other Representatives of the other, access, during normal business hours during the period prior to the Effective Time or until the termination of this Agreement, to all its properties, books, contracts, commitments and records and, during such period, each of Optium and Finisar shall (and shall cause each of its Subsidiaries to) furnish promptly to the other (i) a copy of each report, schedule, registration statement and other document filed or received by it during such period pursuant to the requirements of federal securities Law and (ii) all other information concerning its business, properties and personnel as such other party may reasonably request; _provided_ , _however_ , that neither Optium nor Finisar nor any of their respective Subsidiaries shall be required to provide access to or to disclose information where such access or disclosure would materially interfere with the conduct of its business, contravene any Law or binding agreement entered into prior to the date of this Agreement or would reasonably be expected to violate or result in a loss or impairment of any attorney-client or work product privilege (it being understood and agreed that a party\'s right to limit access to certain information under this Section 6.6 shall not affect a determination of whether the closing conditions in Section 7.2(a) and Section 7.3(a) have been satisfied). Unless otherwise required by Law, the parties will hold any such information which is nonpublic in confidence in accordance with the Confidentiality Agreement. No information or knowledge obtained in any investigation pursuant to this Section 6.6 shall affect or be deemed to modify any representation or warranty contained in this Agreement or the conditions to the obligations of the parties to consummate the Merger. 

  

 Section 6.7 _ Stockholders\' Meetings; Recommendation_. Optium and Finisar each shall use its best efforts to cause a meeting of its respective stockholders (the " _Stockholders\' Meeting_ ") to be held as soon as reasonably practicable after the date hereof for the purpose, in the case of Optium, of obtaining the Optium Stockholder Approval, and, in the case of Finisar, of obtaining the Finisar Stockholder Approval (each, a " _Stockholder Proposal_ "). Except as set forth in Sections 6.1 and 6.2, respectively, each of the Boards of Directors of Optium and Finisar shall use its respective best efforts to obtain from its respective stockholders the approval of its respective Stockholder Proposal and shall recommend to its respective stockholders that they so vote at its respective Stockholders\' Meeting or any adjournment or postponement thereof and shall not withdraw, qualify or modify in any manner adverse to the other party such recommendation. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, if this Agreement is earlier terminated in accordance with its terms, neither Finisar nor Optium shall be required to submit its respective Stockholder Proposal for approval by its stockholders at its respective Stockholders\' Meeting. 

  

 Section 6.8 _ Legal Conditions to Merger_. 

  

 (a) Each of Finisar and Optium will take all reasonable actions necessary to comply promptly with all legal requirements which may be imposed on itself with respect to the Merger (which actions shall 

        
  

include, without limitation, furnishing all information required under the
HSR Act and in connection with applicable approvals of or filings with any
other Governmental Entity) and will promptly cooperate with and furnish
information to each other in connection with any such requirements imposed
upon either of them or any of their Subsidiaries in connection with the
Merger. Each of Finisar and Optium will, and will cause its Subsidiaries to,
(i) take all reasonable actions necessary to obtain (and will cooperate with
each other in obtaining) any consent, authorization, order or approval of, or
any exemption by, any Governmental Entity required to be obtained or made by
Finisar, Optium or any of their Subsidiaries in connection with the Merger
(any of the foregoing an " _Approval_ ") or the taking of any action
contemplated thereby or by this Agreement, (ii) diligently oppose or pursue
any rehearing, appeal or other challenge which may be available to it of any
refusal to issue any Approval or of any order or ruling of any Governmental
Entity which may adversely affect the ability of the parties hereto
to consummate the Merger or, except as permitted by Sections 6.1 and 6.2, to
take any action contemplated by any Approval or by this Agreement until such
time as such refusal to issue any Approval or any order or ruling has become
final and non-appealable, and (iii) diligently oppose any objections to,
appeals from or petitions to reconsider or reopen any Approval or the taking
of any action contemplated thereby or by this Agreement. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, neither Optium nor Finisar shall be required to agree, as a
condition to any Approval, to sell, license, dispose of, hold separate, or
operate in any specified manner any assets or businesses or Subsidiaries of
Finisar, Sub, Optium or the Surviving Corporation (or to require any such
party or any of their respective Subsidiaries or Affiliates to agree to any
of the foregoing).

  

 (b) Without limiting the generality of the foregoing provisions of Section 6.8(a), as soon as may be reasonably practicable following the execution and delivery of this Agreement, each of Finisar and Optium shall file with the Bureau of Competition of the FTC and the Antitrust Division of the DOJ a Notification and Report Form relating to this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby as required by the HSR Act, as well as comparable premerger notification filings, forms and submissions with any foreign Governmental Entity that may be required by the merger notification or control Laws of any applicable foreign jurisdiction. If any party hereto receives a request for additional information or documentary material from any such Governmental Entity with respect to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, then such party shall use best efforts to make, or cause to be made, as soon as reasonably practicable and after consultation with the other party, an appropriate response in compliance with such request. Each of Finisar and Optium shall promptly (i) cooperate and coordinate with the other in the making of, and supply the other with any information that may be required in order to effectuate, such filings or responses to requests for additional information or documentary material, (ii) promptly inform the other party or parties hereto, as the case may be, of any communication from any Governmental Entity regarding any of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, (iii) permit the other to review and discuss in advance, and consider in good faith the views of the other in connection with, any proposed written or material oral communication with any such Governmental Entity (which, at the request of either of the parties, shall be limited to outside antitrust counsel only), (iv) not participate in any meeting with any such Governmental Entity unless it consults with the other in advance and, to the extent permitted by such Governmental Entity, gives the other the opportunity to attend and participate thereat, and (v) furnish the other with copies of all correspondence, filings and communications (and memoranda setting forth the substance thereof) between it and any such Governmental Entity. 

   

 Section 6.9 _ Public Disclosure_. 

  

 (a) On the date this Agreement is executed (or if executed after the close of business, no later than the opening of the NASDAQ Global Market on the next day), Finisar and Optium shall issue a joint press release with respect to the execution hereof and the transactions contemplated hereby. Except to the extent not permitted under any applicable Law or any listing agreement with or rule of any regulatory body, national securities exchange or association, Finisar and Optium shall consult with 

        
  

each other before issuing any press release, making any other public
statement or scheduling any press conference or conference call with investors
or analysts with respect to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement.

  

 (b) Neither Finisar nor Optium shall issue any press release or other public statement concerning the transactions contemplated by this Agreement without first providing the other with a written copy of the text of such release or statement and obtaining the consent of the other to such release or statement, which consent will not be unreasonably withheld or delayed. The consent provided for in this Section 6.9(b) shall not be required if the delay would preclude the timely issuance of a press release or public statement required by Law or any applicable regulations. The provisions of this Section 6.9(b) shall not be construed as limiting the parties from communications consistent with the purposes of this Agreement, including but not limited to seeking the regulatory and stockholder approvals contemplated hereby. 

  

 Section 6.10 _ Tax-Free Reorganization_. Each of Finisar, Sub and Optium shall use all reasonable efforts to cause the Merger to be treated as a "reorganization" within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code. None of Finisar, Sub and Optium shall knowingly take any action, or fail to take any action, which action or failure to act would reasonably be expected to prevent the Merger from qualifying as a reorganization within the meaning of Code Section 368(a)(1)(A) and 368(a)(2)(E), and each shall file all Returns consistent with the treatment of the Merger as a reorganization within the meaning of Code Section 368(a)(1)(A) and 368(a)(2)(E). 

  

 Section 6.11 _ Stockholder Litigation_. If stockholder litigation is commenced against Optium or Finisar relating to the Merger or any other transactions contemplated hereby, the defending party shall give the other party the opportunity, subject to a customary joint defense agreement, to participate in, but not control, the defense or settlement of any such stockholder litigation by the defending party. 

   

 Section 6.12 _ NASDAQ Quotation_. Finisar shall cause the shares of Finisar Common Stock to be issued in the Merger to be approved for quotation on the NASDAQ Global Select Market, subject to official notice of issuance, prior to the Closing Date. 

  

 Section 6.13 _ Stock Plans, Options, Warrants, Employee Benefits_. 

  

 (a) At the Effective Time, each outstanding Optium Option, whether vested or unvested, shall be assumed by Finisar and converted into an option to acquire, on the same terms and conditions as were applicable under such Optium Option, a number of shares of Finisar Common Stock (rounded down to the nearest whole number) equal to the product of (1) the number of shares of Optium Common Stock purchasable pursuant to such Optium Option (without regard to vesting) immediately prior to the Effective Time and (2) the Exchange Ratio, at a price per share (rounded up to the nearest whole cent) equal to (i) the exercise price for the share of Optium Common Stock otherwise purchasable pursuant to such Optium Option (without regard to vesting) immediately prior to the Effective Time divided by (ii) the Exchange Ratio; _provided_ , _however_ , that in the case of any Optium Options to which Section 422 of the Code applies (" _incentive stock options_ "), the option price, the number of shares purchasable pursuant to such option and the terms and conditions of exercise of such option shall be calculated differently, if necessary, in order to comply with Section 424(a) of the Code and to avoid a "modification" of any Optium Option under Section 424(h) of the Code. In addition, any Optium Option converted pursuant to this section 6.13(a) shall be converted in a manner that complies with Section 409A of the Code (or an available exemption therefrom) and any guidance issued pursuant to Section 409A of the Code by the U.S. Department of Treasury. 

  

 (b) At the Effective Time, each Optium RSU Award which is outstanding and which has not been settled by the issuance of shares of Optium Common Stock immediately prior to the Effective Time shall cease to represent a right to receive upon settlement thereof shares of Optium Common Stock and shall be assumed by Finisar and converted into a right to receive upon settlement thereof shares of 

        
  

Finisar Common Stock in an amount determined as provided below (and each
converted RSU Award otherwise shall remain subject to the terms of Optium\'s
2006 Stock Option and Incentive Plan, and the applicable agreement, notice or
letter evidencing the grant of Optium RSU Award thereunder). The number of
shares of Finisar Common Stock to be subject to a converted RSU Award shall be
equal to the product of (x) the number of shares of Optium Common Stock
subject to the Optium RSU Award and (y) the Exchange Ratio, provided that any
fractional shares of Finisar Common Stock resulting from such multiplication
shall be rounded down to the nearest whole share. Prior to the Effective Time,
Optium shall take all action necessary to be taken by Optium in order to
effect the foregoing provisions of this Section.

  

 (c) As soon as reasonably practicable after the Effective Time, Finisar shall deliver to each holder of an Optium Option or an Optium RSU Award outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time an appropriate notice evidencing the assumption of Optium securities by Finisar as provided in Sections 6.13(a) and (b). Finisar shall comply with the terms of the Optium Option Plans and the agreements evidencing the Optium Options and the Optium RSU Awards, subject to the adjustments made pursuant to this Section, and shall ensure, to the extent required by, and subject to the provisions of each such plan and agreement, that Optium Options which qualified as incentive stock options immediately prior to the Effective Time will continue to qualify as incentive stock options after the Effective Time to the maximum extent permitted by Law. Each holder of a converted Optium Option or a converted Optium RSU Award shall be credited with such holder\'s service with Optium or its Subsidiaries for purposes of determining such holder\'s vesting rights under such converted Optium Option or Optium RSU Award, as applicable. 

   

 (d) Finisar shall take all corporate action necessary to reserve for issuance a sufficient number of shares of Finisar Common Stock for delivery upon the exercise of the Optium Options assumed in accordance with this Section 6.13. As soon as practicable after the Effective Time, and not more than fifteen (15) business days thereafter, Finisar shall file a registration statement on Form S-8 (or any successor or other appropriate form) with respect to the shares of Finisar Common Stock subject to the Optium Options and the Optium RSU Awards assumed pursuant to this Section 6.13 and shall use its reasonable efforts to maintain the effectiveness of such registration statement or registration statements (and maintain the current status of the prospectus or prospectuses contained therein) for so long as the Optium Options and the Optium RSU Awards remain outstanding. With respect to those individuals, if any, who subsequent to the Merger will be subject to the reporting requirements under Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act, where applicable, Finisar shall administer the Optium Options and the Optium RSU Awards assumed pursuant to this Section 6.13 in a manner that complies with Rule 16b-3 promulgated under the Exchange Act to the extent the Optium Options and Optium RSU Awards complied with such rule prior to the Merger. 

  

 (e) At the Effective Time, each outstanding Optium Warrant shall be assumed by Finisar and converted into a warrant to acquire, on the same terms and conditions as were applicable under such Optium Warrant, the same number of shares of Finisar Common Stock as the holder of such Optium Warrant would have been entitled to receive pursuant to the Merger had such holder exercised such Optium Warrant in full immediately prior to the Effective Time (rounded down to the nearest whole number), at a price per share (rounded up to the nearest whole cent) equal to (i) the aggregate exercise price for the shares of Finisar Common Stock otherwise purchasable pursuant to such Optium Warrant divided by (ii) the number of full shares of Finisar Common Stock deemed purchasable pursuant to such Optium Warrant in accordance with the foregoing. As soon as practicable after the Effective Time, Finisar shall deliver to the holders of the Optium Warrants appropriate notice setting forth such holders\' rights pursuant hereto and shall deliver to such holders, upon surrender of their Optium Warrants, new warrants (the " _Finisar Warrants_ ") evidencing such holders\' rights pursuant hereto. Finisar shall take all corporate action necessary to reserve for issuance a sufficient number of 

        
  

shares of Finisar Common Stock for delivery upon the exercise of the Finisar
Warrants in accordance with this Section 6.13.

  

 (f) Employees of Optium as of the Effective Time shall be permitted to participate in the Finisar Purchase Plan commencing on the first enrollment date of such plan following the Effective Time, subject to the eligibility provisions of such plan (with employees receiving credit, for purposes of such eligibility provisions, for service with Optium or Finisar). 

  

 (g) Finisar shall, and shall cause the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries to, provide each employee of the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries with benefits, including 401(k), deferred compensation, health and welfare and paid-time off benefits, which are no less favorable in the aggregate than those generally provided by Finisar to an employee of comparable rank and location. 

  

 (h) Except to the extent necessary to avoid duplication of benefits, to the extent that any employee of Optium or any of Optium\'s Subsidiaries becomes eligible to participate in any employee benefit plan of Finisar after the Effective Time, Finisar, the Surviving Corporation and their Subsidiaries, to the extent such employee benefit plan permits, shall credit such employee\'s service with Optium or its Subsidiaries for purposes of determining such employee\'s eligibility to participate in and vesting under, and for purposes of calculating the benefits under, such employee benefit plan. Finisar, the Surviving Corporation and their Subsidiaries will (i) waive all limitations as to preexisting conditions exclusions and waiting periods with respect to participation and coverage requirements applicable to any employee of Optium or any of Optium\'s Subsidiaries under any welfare plan that such employees may be eligible to participate in after the Effective Time, to the extent permitted by such plan, other than limitations or waiting periods that are already in effect with respect to such employees and that have not been satisfied as of the Effective Time under any welfare plan maintained for such employees immediately prior to the Effective Time, and (ii) provide each such employee with credit for any credit for any co-payment and deductibles paid prior to the Effective Time in satisfying any applicable deductible or out-of-pocket requirements under any welfare plan that such employees are eligible to participate in after the Effective Time, to the extent permitted by such plan. 

  

 Section 6.14 _ Brokers or Finders_. Each of Finisar and Optium represents, as to itself, its Subsidiaries and its Affiliates, that no agent, broker, investment banker, financial advisor or other firm or person is or will be entitled to any broker\'s or finder\'s fee or any other commission or similar fee in connection with any of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement except Morgan Stanley, whose fees and expenses will be paid by Optium in accordance with Optium\'s agreement with such firm, and Oppenheimer, whose fees and expenses will be paid by Finisar in accordance with Finisar\'s agreement with such firm, and each of Finisar and Optium agrees to indemnify and hold the other harmless from and against any and all claims, liabilities or obligations with respect to any other fees, commissions or expenses asserted by any person on the basis of any act or statement alleged to have been made by such party or its Affiliate. 

  

 Section 6.15 _ Indemnification of Directors and Officers_. 

   

 (a) Finisar shall cause the Surviving Corporation to indemnify, defend and hold harmless each person who is now, or has been at any time prior to the date of this Agreement or who becomes prior to the Effective Time, an officer, director or employee of Optium or any of its Subsidiaries (the " _Indemnified Parties_ ") against all losses, claims, damages, costs, expenses, liabilities or judgments or amounts that are paid in settlement with the approval of the indemnifying party (which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld) of or in connection with any claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation (each, a " _Proceeding_ ") based in whole or in part on or arising in whole or in part out of the fact that such person is or was a director, officer or employee of Optium or any of its Subsidiaries, whether pertaining to any matter existing or occurring at or prior to the Effective Time and whether asserted or claimed prior to, or at or after, the Effective Time (" _Indemnified Liabilities_ ") including, without limitation, all losses, claims, damages, costs, expenses, liabilities or judgments based in whole or 

        
  

in part on, or arising in whole or in part out of, or pertaining to this
Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby. Any Indemnified Party
wishing to claim indemnification under this Section 6.15, upon learning of
any such claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation, shall promptly
notify Finisar or the Surviving Corporation (but the failure so to notify
an indemnifying party shall not relieve it from any liability which it may
have under this Section 6.15 except to the extent such failure prejudices such
party), and, in connection with any request for an advancement of expenses,
shall deliver to Finisar and the Surviving Corporation an undertaking of the
type contemplated by Section 145(e) of the DGCL. An Indemnified Party
will cooperate reasonably with the Surviving Corporation, at the Surviving
Corporation\'s expense, in the defense of such matter, and the Surviving
Corporation shall have the right to control the defense of such matter and
shall retain only one set of legal counsel selected by the Surviving
Corporation and reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnified Party (plus one
local counsel, if necessary) to represent all Indemnified Parties with
respect to each such matter unless there is, under applicable standards of
professional conduct, a conflict on any significant issue between the
positions of any two or more Indemnified Parties, in which case such
additional counsel as may be required (as shall be reasonably determined by
the Indemnified Parties and the Surviving Corporation) may be retained by the
Indemnified Parties.

  

 (b) From and after the Effective Time, Finisar will cause the Surviving Corporation to honor in all respects the obligations of Optium pursuant to the Optium Charter Documents, as in effect as of the date hereof, and any indemnification agreement between Optium and any of Optium\'s directors and officers existing and in force as of the date of this Agreement and filed as an exhibit to the Optium SEC Filings. Finisar and the Surviving Corporation shall not, for a period of six (6) years from the Effective Time, amend, repeal or otherwise modify any such provisions in any manner that would adversely affect the rights thereunder of any individuals who, immediately prior to the Effective Time, were current or former directors, officers, or employees of the Acquired Companies unless such amendment, repeal or modification is required by applicable Law, and all rights to indemnification thereunder in respect of any claim asserted or made within such period shall continue until the final disposition or resolution of such claim. 

  

 (c) At or prior to the Effective Time, Optium shall purchase a "tail" directors\' and officers\' liability insurance policy (which by its terms shall survive the Merger) for its directors and officers, which shall provide such directors and officers with coverage for six (6) years following the Effective Time of not less than (or more than) the existing coverage under, and have other terms not materially less favorable on the whole to, the insured persons than the directors\' and officers\' liability insurance coverage presently maintained by Optium, so long as the aggregate premium is less than 225% of the aggregate annual premiums currently paid by Optium for such insurance. In the event that such amount is insufficient for such coverage, Optium may spend up to that amount to purchase such lesser coverage as may be obtained with such amount. Finisar shall, and shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, maintain such policy in full force and effect, and continue to honor the obligations thereunder. 

  

 (d) The provisions of this Section 6.15 are intended to be for the benefit of, and shall be enforceable by, each Indemnified Party, his or her heirs and Representatives, and may not be amended, altered or repealed without the written consent of any affected Indemnified Party. 

  

 Section 6.16 _ Additional Agreements; Reasonable Efforts_. Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, each of the parties agrees to use commercially reasonable efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all action and to do, or cause to be done, all things necessary, proper or advisable under applicable Law to consummate and make effective the transactions contemplated by this Agreement as promptly as commercially practicable. In case at any time after the Effective Time any further action is necessary or desirable to carry out the purposes of this Agreement or to vest the Surviving Corporation with full title to all properties, assets, rights, approvals, immunities and franchises of either of the Constituent Corporations, the proper officers and directors of each party to this Agreement shall take all such necessary action. 

       

              Section 6.17 _ Termination of 401(k)
Plans_. Effective no later than the last day of the payroll
period immediately preceding the Closing Date, Optium and its ERISA
Affiliates, as applicable, shall each terminate any and all plans intended to
include a Code Section 401(k) arrangement (collectively, the " _401(k) Plans_
") unless Finisar provides written notice to Optium that any 401(k) Plan shall
not be so terminated. Unless Finisar provides such written notice to Optium,
no later than seven (7) business days prior to the Closing Date, Optium shall
provide to Finisar (i) copies of duly adopted resolutions by Optium\'s Board
of Directors authorizing the termination of such 401(k) Plans and (ii) with
respect to each 401(k) Plan, an executed amendment to the 401(k) Plan
sufficient to assure compliance with all applicable requirements of the Code
and regulations thereunder so that the tax-qualified status of the 401(k) Plan
shall be maintained at the time of termination. The form and substance of
such resolutions and amendment shall be subject to the prior review and
approval of Finisar.

   

 Section 6.18 _ Finisar Board of Directors_. Effective at the Effective Time, Finisar shall increase the number of authorized members of its Board of Directors from seven (7) to nine (9). Finisar shall use its best efforts to obtain the resignation of a director of Finisar, if necessary, such that at the Effective Time, three (3) vacancies will exist on the Finisar Board of Directors. Subject to the fiduciary duties of its Board of Directors and the willingness and ability of the following individuals to serve, Finisar shall cause Morgan Jones, Eitan Gertel and Christopher Crespi currently members of the Optium Board of Directors (the " _Optium Director Designees_ "), to be appointed as Class I, Class II and Class III members of the Finisar Board of Directors, respectively, effective immediately after the Effective Time, and Finisar\'s Board of Directors has approved the addition of such individuals as directors of Finisar in such Classes immediately after the Effective Time. 

  

 Section 6.19 _ Finisar Executive Officers_. Prior to the Effective Time, the Finisar Board of Directors shall take such action as is necessary to confirm the appointment of Jerry S. Rawls to the office of Chairman of the Board of Finisar and Eitan Gertel to the office of Chief Executive Officer of Finisar, effective as of the Effective Time, in each case subject to the willingness and ability of such individuals to serve in such capacities. 

  

 Section 6.20 _ Notification of Certain Matters_. 

  

 (a) Optium shall give prompt notice to Finisar and Sub of any of the following: (i) any representation or warranty contained in Article III of this Agreement being untrue, inaccurate or incomplete when made, (ii) the occurrence of any event or development that would cause (or could reasonably be expected to cause) any representation or warranty contained in Article 3 to be untrue, inaccurate or incomplete at any time on or before the Effective Time, or (iii) any failure of Optium to comply with or satisfy any covenant, condition, or agreement to be complied with or satisfied by it hereunder. 

  

 (b) Finisar shall give prompt notice to Optium of any of the following: (i) any representation or warranty contained in Article IV of this Agreement being untrue, inaccurate or incomplete when made, (ii) the occurrence of any event or development that would cause (or could reasonably be expected to cause) any representation or warranty contained in Article 4 to be untrue, inaccurate or incomplete at any time on or before the Effective Time, or (iii) any failure of Finisar to comply with or satisfy any covenant, condition, or agreement to be complied with or satisfied by it hereunder. 

  

 (c) Notwithstanding the above, the delivery of any notice pursuant to this Section will not limit or otherwise affect the remedies available hereunder to the party receiving such notice or the conditions to such party\'s obligation to consummate the Merger. 

  

 Section 6.21 _ Exemption from Liability Under Section 16(b)_. Prior to the Effective Time, Finisar, Optium and their respective Boards of Directors shall adopt resolutions consistent with the interpretive guidance of the SEC and take any other actions as may be required, to the extent permitted under applicable Law, to cause any dispositions of Optium Common Stock (including derivative securities with respect to Optium Common Stock) or acquisitions of Finisar Common Stock (including derivative 

        
  

securities with respect to Finisar Common Stock) resulting from the
transactions contemplated hereby by each individual who is subject to the
reporting requirements of Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act to be exempt from
Section 16(b) of the Exchange Act under Rule 16b-3 promulgated under the
Exchange Act.

 (e) Optium shall have received a written opinion from Goodwin Procter LLP, counsel to Optium, in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to Optium and Finisar, to the effect that the Merger will constitute a "reorganization" within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code; provided, however, that if Goodwin Procter LLP does not render such opinion, this condition will nevertheless be satisfied if DLA Piper US LLP, counsel to Finisar, renders a written opinion to Finisar, in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to Optium, to the effect that the Merger will constitute a "reorganization" within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code. The issuance of such opinion shall be conditioned upon the receipt by such counsel of customary representation letters from each of Finisar and Sub, on the one hand, and Optium, on the other hand, in each case, in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to such counsel.

shall be true and correct in all respects (except in the case of Section 3.2

covenants, obligations or conditions contained in this Agreement. Any
agreement on the part of a party to this Agreement to any such extension or
waiver shall be valid only if set forth in a written instrument signed by an
authorized Representative on behalf of such party.
