---|--- 



   3.1. |

Subject to and in consideration of the Bidder announcing a firm intention to
make the Acquisition pursuant to the Rule 2.5 Announcement and subject to the
provisions of this Agreement, Elan agrees to pay to the Bidder, if any Bidder
Payment Event occurs, an amount equal to all documented, specific and
quantifiable third party costs and expenses incurred by the Bidder, or on its
behalf, for the purposes of, in preparation for, or in connection with the
Acquisition, including, but not limited to, exploratory work carried out in
contemplation of and in connection with the Acquisition, legal, financial and
commercial due diligence, arranging financing and engaging advisers to assist
in the process (the payments provided for in this Clause 3.1, the "Bidder
Reimbursement Payments"); provided that the gross amount  

---|--- 
 



6 in any event, exceed such sum as is equal to US$84,441,843 (Eighty four
million, four hundred forty-one thousand, eight hundred forty-three), being
1% of the total value attributable to the entire issued share capital of Elan
that is the subject of the Acquisition (but excluding, for the avoidance of
doubt, any interest in such share capital of Elan held by the Bidder or
any Associate of the Bidder) as set out in the Rule 2.5 Announcement (the
"Cap"). The amount of third party costs and expenses to be taken into account
for the purposes of the calculation of Bidder Reimbursement Payments and
which therefore could be payable by Elan to the Bidder under this Clause 3.1
will exclude any amounts in respect of VAT incurred by the Bidder attributable
to such third party costs and expenses to the extent that such amounts in
respect of VAT are recoverable or creditable by the Bidder (or any member of
the VAT Group of which the Bidder is a member). 
---|--- 



   3.2. | The "Bidder Payment Events" are where the Parties have issued
the Rule 2.5 Announcement and: 
---|--- 
 



     | (a) | the Transaction Agreement is terminated: 
---|---|--- 



     | (i) | by the Bidder for the reason that the Elan Board or any
committee thereof (A) withdraws, withholds, or qualifies or modifies in a
manner adverse to the Bidder, or proposes publicly to withdraw; withdrawn,
qualify or modify in a manner adverse to the Bidder; the Scheme Recommendation
or (B) approves, recommends or declares advisable, or proposes publicly to
approve, recommend or declare advisable, any Elan Alternative Proposal (it
being understood, for the avoidance of doubt, that the provision by Elan to
the Bidder of notice or information in connection with an Elan Alternative
Proposal or an Elan Superior Proposal, as required or expressly permitted by
the Transaction Agreement, shall not, in and of itself, satisfy this Clause
3.2(a)(i)); or 
---|---|--- 



     | (ii) | by Elan, at any time prior to obtaining Elan Shareholder
Approval, in order to enter into any agreement, understanding or arrangement
providing for an Elan Superior Proposal; or 
---|---|--- 



     | (b) | all of the following occur: 
---|---|--- 



     | (i) | prior to the Court Meeting, an Elan Alternative Proposal is
publicly disclosed or any person shall have publicly announced an intention
(whether or not conditional) to make an Elan Alternative Proposal and, in
each case, not publicly withdrawn without qualification at least three
Business Days before the date of the Court Meeting (it being understood that,
for purposes of this Clause 3.2(b)(i) and Clause 3.2(b)(iii) below,
references to "25%" and "75%" in the definition of Elan Alternative Proposal
shall be deemed to refer to "80%" and "20%", respectively); and 
---|---|--- 
 



     | (ii) | the Transaction Agreement is terminated by either Elan or
the Bidder for the reason that the Court Meeting or the EGM shall have been
completed and the Court Meeting Resolution or the EGM Resolutions, as
applicable, shall not have been approved by the requisite majorities; and 
---|---|--- 



     | (iii) | either (A) an Elan Alternative Proposal is consummated
within twelve months or (B) a definitive agreement providing for an Elan
Alternative Proposal is entered into within twelve months after such
termination (regardless of whether such Elan Alternative Proposal is the same
Elan Alternative Proposal referred to in Clause 3.2(b)(i)) and such Elan
Alternative Proposal is consummated, or  
---|---|--- 
 



7 ---|---|--- 



     | (i) | prior to the Court Meeting, an Elan Alternative Proposal is
publicly disclosed or any person shall have publicly announced an intention
(whether or not conditional) to make an Elan Alternative Proposal and, in
each case, not publicly withdrawn without qualification at the time the
Transaction Agreement is terminated under the circumstances specified in
Clause 3.2(c)(ii) (it being understood that, for purposes of this Clause
3.2(c)(i) and Clause 3.2(c)(iii) below, references to "25%" and "75%" in the
definition of Elan Alternative Proposal shall be deemed to refer to "80%" and
"20%" respectively); and  
---|---|--- 



     | (ii) | the Transaction Agreement is terminated by the Bidder for
the reason that Elan shall have breached or failed to perform in any material
respect any of its covenants or other agreements contained in the Transaction
Agreement or any of its representations or warranties set forth in the
Transaction Agreement are inaccurate, which breach or failure to perform or
inaccuracy (A) would result in a failure of any of the conditions to the
Scheme or of the other conditions to the Bidders obligations to effect the
Acquisition and (B) is not reasonably capable of being cured by the date that
is one year after the date of the Transaction Agreement, provided that, the
Bidder shall have given Elan written notice, delivered at least 30 days prior
to such termination, stating the Bidders intention to terminate the
Transaction Agreement for such reason and the basis for such termination;
and  
---|---|--- 



     | (iii) | either (A) an Elan Alternative Proposal is consummated
within twelve months, or (B) a definitive agreement providing for an Elan
Alternative Proposal is entered into, within twelve months after such
termination and such Elan Alternative Proposal is consummated (regardless of
whether such Elan Alternative Proposal is the same Elan Alternative Proposal
referred to in Clause 3.2(c)(i)).  
---|---|--- 



   3.3. | For purposes of Clause 3.2(b) and Clause 3.2(c), an Elan
Alternative Proposal shall not be deemed to have been publically withdrawn by
any Person if, within twelve months after termination of the Transaction
Agreement, Elan or any of its Subsidiaries enters into a definitive agreement
providing for, or the Elan Board or Elan approves or recommends to the Elan
Shareholders, or does not oppose, an Elan Alternative Proposal made by or on
behalf of such Person or its Affiliates, or such an Elan Alternative Proposal
is consummated. 
---|--- 



   3.4. | Each request by the Bidder for a Bidder Reimbursement Payment
shall be: 
---|--- 



     | (a) | submitted in writing to Elan no later than 30 calendar days
following the occurrence of any of the Bidder Payment Events; 
---|---|--- 
 



     | (b) | accompanied by written invoices or written documentation
supporting the request for a Bidder Reimbursement Payment; and 
---|---|--- 
 



     | (c) | subject to satisfactory compliance with Clause 3.4(b) and
the other provisions of this Agreement upon which a Bidder Reimbursement
Payment may be conditioned, satisfied in full by payment in full by Elan to
the Bidder in cleared, immediately available funds within 21 calendar days
following such receipt of such invoices or documentation. 
---|---|--- 
 



8 determines that any Bidder Reimbursement Payment is consideration for a
taxable supply and that Elan (or any member of a VAT Group of which Elan is a
member) is liable to account to a Tax Authority for VAT in respect of such
supply and that all or any part of such VAT is Irrecoverable VAT, then: 
---|--- 
 



     | 3.5.1. | the amount payable by Elan by way of any Bidder
Reimbursement Payment, together with any Irrecoverable VAT arising in respect
of the supply for which the payment is consideration, shall not exceed the
Cap; and 
---|---|--- 



     | 3.5.2. | to the extent that Elan has already paid an amount in
respect of any Bidder Reimbursement Payment which exceeds the amount described
in Clause 3.5.1 above, the Bidder shall repay to Elan the portion of the
Irrecoverable VAT in excess of the Cap. 
---|---|--- 



   4. | GENERAL
