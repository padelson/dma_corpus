terms and conditions of this Agreement and the applicable provisions of the
DGCL, Merger Sub will merge with and into Midco, the separate corporate
existence of Merger Sub shall cease, and Midco shall continue as the
surviving company after the Merger. The Merger will be consummated immediately
upon the filing of a Certificate of Merger with the Secretary of State of the
State of Delaware, or at such other time as may be agreed by the Buyer and
the Company in writing and specified in such filings (the " _Effective Time_
"). The effect of the Merger will be as provided in this Agreement, the
Certificate of Merger, and the applicable provisions of the DGCL. Without
limiting the generality of the foregoing, and subject thereto, at the
Effective Time, all of the property, rights, privileges, powers, franchises,
debts, liabilities, and duties of Merger Sub and Midco shall vest in Midco as
the surviving company following the Merger.

  



  

Section 2.2. _Governing Documents_. At the Effective Time, the Certificate of
Incorporation and Bylaws of Merger Sub shall become the Certificate of
Incorporation and Bylaws of the surviving company, except that the name of the
surviving company shall be "TGIF Midco, Inc."

  



  

Section 2.3. _Effect on Securities_. Subject to the terms and conditions of
this Agreement, by virtue of the Distribution, the Merger and this Agreement
and without any further action on the part of the Parties or the holders of
any of the securities of the Company or Midco, the following shall occur:

  



  

(a)  _Treatment of Company Convertible Securities_. In connection with the
Merger and effective as of the Distribution, each option (or portion thereof)
granted under Midco's 2014 Stock Option Plan (the " _2014 Plan_ ") that is
then outstanding and vested will be automatically cancelled, and in respect
of such cancellation the holder thereof shall be entitled to receive an
amount equal to (i) the excess, if any, of (A) the Per Share Merger
Consideration, over (B) the per share exercise price, multiplied by (ii) the
number of Midco Shares subject to such option (or portion thereof), such
payment to be paid in such mix of Cash Consideration and Merger Shares as
Midco's board of directors (or a committee thereof) shall determine consistent
with the 2014 Plan and  _Section 2.3(b)_ , subject to applicable tax
withholding, not later than the next payroll date following the
consummation of the Merger (or at such other time or times required by
Section 409A of the Code.) Any holder of options that are cancelled in
consideration for a payment as described in the preceding sentence shall be
treated as a Midco Equityholder for purposes of  _Section 2.7_ and shall be
entitled to receive Contingent Shares, or a cash payment in lieu of such
Contingent Shares, in accordance with this Agreement at the time set forth
_Section 2.7_. Effective as of the Distribution, each outstanding
option (other than the options described in the first sentence of this
_Section 2.3(a)_ ), warrant, convertible note, and other derivative security
of the Company and the Acquired Companies (collectively, the " _Company
Convertible Securities_ "), to the extent then unconverted or unexercised,
will be automatically cancelled without consideration and without any
liability to the Company. As of immediately prior to the Distribution, the
only securities of the Company outstanding shall be Company Units and the
only securities of Midco outstanding shall be Midco Shares.

  



   

10

 



    



  

(b)  _Conversion of Midco Shares_. Effective as of immediately following the
Distribution and immediately prior to the Merger, each Midco Share issued and
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time will be automatically
converted, at the Effective Time, into the right to receive the Per Share
Merger Consideration, with such mix of Cash Consideration and Merger Shares as
each Midco Equityholder elects (or is deemed to have elected) in accordance
with _Section 2.3(f)_ to be paid at Closing; _provided_ ,  _however_ , that
if the product of (i) $10.15 and (ii) the Merger Shares is less than forty
percent (40%) of the Merger Consideration payable at Closing, then, as
necessary to preserve the status of the Merger as a "reorganization" within
the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code, the portion of the Merger
Consideration payable upon the Closing that is elected by Midco
Equityholders to be paid in Cash Consideration shall be instead paid in Buyer
Common Stock so that the product of (x) $10.15 and (y) the Merger Shares is
equal to at least forty percent (40%) of the total Merger Consideration paid
on a cumulative basis to the Midco Equityholders under this Agreement, with
the determination of the adjustment to the mix of Cash Consideration and
Merger Shares for each Midco Equityholder to be within the equitable good
faith discretion of the Persons owning immediately prior to the Effective Time
at least two-thirds of the then outstanding Midco Shares.

  



  

(c)  _Cancellation of Treasury and Buyer-Owned Units_. Each Midco Share held
by Midco, Buyer or any Subsidiary of Midco or Buyer immediately prior to the
Effective Time shall be cancelled and extinguished without any conversion or
payment in respect thereof.

  



  

(d)  _Adjustments to Merger Consideration_. The number of shares of Buyer
Common Stock issuable as Merger Consideration shall be equitably adjusted to
reflect appropriately the effect of any share split, reverse share split,
share dividend (including any dividend or distribution of securities
convertible into shares of Buyer Common Stock), reorganization,
recapitalization, reclassification, combination, exchange of shares or other
like change with respect to shares of Buyer Common Stock occurring on or after
the date hereof but at or prior to the Effective Time (or, as it relates to
the Contingent Shares, prior to the date of issuance of such shares in
accordance with _Section 2.7_ ).

  



  

(e)  _Fractional Shares_. No fraction of a share of Buyer Common Stock will
be issued by virtue of the Merger, and each Person who would otherwise be
entitled to a fraction of a share of Buyer Common Stock any time Buyer Common
Stock is distributed to any such Person pursuant to this Agreement (after
aggregating all fractional shares of Buyer Common Stock that otherwise would
be received by such Person in connection with such distribution) shall, upon
compliance with this _Section 2.3_ , receive from Buyer, in lieu of such
fractional share, one (1) share of Buyer Common Stock.

  



   

11

 



    



  

(f)  _Exchange Procedures_. Each Company Equityholder that shall become a
Midco Equityholder upon consummation of the Distribution shall execute and
deliver to the Company and Midco a letter of transmittal, in the form
specified by the Company (each, a " _Letter of Transmittal_ " and
collectively, the " _Letters of Transmittal_ ") no later than fifteen (15)
Business Days after the date of this Agreement, which shall include such
Company Equityholder's election with respect to its desired mix (subject to
_Section 2.3(b)_ ) of Cash Consideration and Merger Shares. The Company shall
provide copies of all Letters of Transmittal received from such equityholders
to Buyer not later than sixteen (16) Business Days after the date of this
Agreement. At least two (2) Business Days prior to the Closing Date, Midco
shall deliver to the Buyer the Payment Schedule and all Letters of
Transmittal. At the Closing, each Midco Equityholder, each of whom shall have
executed and delivered to the Company and Midco a Letter of Transmittal,
shall receive the Per Share Merger Consideration in exchange for each Midco
Share held by such Midco Equityholder as of immediately prior to the Closing,
in each case as set forth opposite the name of such Midco Equityholder on the
Payment Schedule. The Company Representative shall update the Payment Schedule
to reflect the pro rata allocations among the Midco Equityholders of any
Contingent Shares that may be earned, and provide such updated Payment
Schedule to the Buyer at least two (2) Business Days prior to the payment
date for such additional consideration.

  



  

(g)  _Required Withholding_. Buyer shall be entitled to deduct and withhold
(or cause to be deducted and withheld) from any consideration payable or
otherwise deliverable pursuant to this Agreement such amounts as are required
to be deducted or withheld therefrom under the Code or under any provision of
state, local or foreign Tax law or under any other applicable Legal
Requirement. Buyer shall provide notice of any withholding that it intends to
make (or cause to be made) in connection with consideration payable or
otherwise deliverable pursuant to this Agreement (other than any withholding
required in connection with amounts properly treated as compensation for
applicable Tax purposes) at least fifteen (15) days prior to the date of the
relevant payment, and the Parties shall (and shall cause their Affiliates to)
cooperate to minimize or eliminate any potential withholding. To the extent
such amounts are so deducted or withheld consistent with the terms of this
_Section 2.3(g)_ , such amounts shall be treated for all purposes under this
Agreement as having been paid to the Person to whom such amounts would
otherwise have been paid.

  



  

(h)  _No Further Ownership Rights in Midco Shares_. The Merger Consideration
payable in accordance with the terms hereof shall be deemed to have been paid
in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to all Midco Shares and there
shall be no further registration of transfers on the records of Midco of
Midco Shares that were outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time.

  



  

Section 2.4. _The Closing_. The closing of the Contemplated Transactions (the
" _Closing_ ") will take place at 10:00 a.m. New York time at the offices of

the satisfaction or waiver of such conditions at Closing), or at such other
time and place as may be agreed to by the Buyer and the Company. Subject to
the provisions of _Article X_ of this Agreement, the failure to consummate
the Closing on the date and time determined pursuant to this _Section 2.4_
will not result in the termination of this Agreement and will not relieve any
Party of any obligation under this Agreement.

Section 2.5. _Deliveries at Closing_. At the Closing, each Party shall
deliver or cause to be delivered all of the certificates, instruments, and
other documents required to be delivered by such Party pursuant to _Article
VIII_ or _Article IX_ , as applicable.

  



  

Section 2.6. _Directors, Officers and Managing Members_. Effective on the
Closing Date, the directors and officers of the Buyer shall be as set forth
on _Schedule 2.6_.

  



  

Section 2.7. _Earnout_.

  



  

(a) Buyer will issue the Contingent Shares to the Midco Equityholders, pro
rata in accordance with the Payment Schedule, upon the first to occur of: (i)
the Buyer's annual EBITDA equals or exceeds $70 million, as reported in
Buyer's annual report on Form 10-K filed with the SEC (" _Form 10-K_ ") for
the year ended December 31, 2020, 2021 or 2022 or (ii) the last sales price
of the Buyer Common Stock equals or exceeds $15.00 per share (as adjusted for
stock splits, stock dividends, reorganizations, and recapitalizations) on any
twenty (20) trading days in a thirty (30) trading day period at any time
after the Closing Date and prior to December 31, 2022.

  



  

(b) As used herein, " _EBITDA_ " means with respect to any future period, as
determined in accordance with GAAP, the consolidated net earnings of Buyer,
before interest income or expense, income taxes, depreciation, amortization,
expenses arising solely from the Contemplated Transactions charged to income
in such future period, and, as reported in the Buyer's Form 10-K,
extraordinary one-time items and stock based compensation. The term "EBITDA"
(i) excludes any earnings from companies acquired by the Buyer after the
Closing Date, (ii) excludes any earnings from franchises acquired by the
Acquired Companies from the date hereof up to and including the Closing Date
or by the Buyer after the Closing Date (except in connection with
the Acquired Companies' planned acquisition of franchise stores as described
in _Section 5.1(b)(vii)_ of the Company Disclosure Schedule), in either case
net of the franchise fee income Buyer would have received if such franchise
had not been acquired, and (iii) includes any earnings from any company-owned
business sold to a franchisee after the Closing Date (but not double
counting franchise fee income received by the Buyer in respect thereof).

  



  

(c) The Contingent Shares shall be issued within five (5) Business Days
after, (i) in the case of the occurrence of the event described in _Section
2.7(a)(i)_ above, the Buyer files its Form 10-K for the fiscal year then
ended, or (ii) in the case of the occurrence of the event described in
_Section 2.7(a)(ii)_ above, the last trading day in such thirty-day period, in
the case of each of (i) and (ii) above, with no action being required on the
part of the Midco Equityholders.

  



  

(d) At all times while the Contingent Shares are earnable, Buyer shall use
commercially reasonable efforts to ensure that the Buyer Common Stock remains
listed on Nasdaq and Buyer shall keep available for issuance a sufficient
number of unissued shares of Buyer Common Stock to permit Buyer to satisfy
its issuance obligations set forth in this _Section 2.7_ and shall take all
actions required to increase the authorized number of shares of Buyer Common
Stock if at any time there shall be insufficient authorized unissued shares
to permit such reservation. If at any time while Contingent Shares are
earnable, Buyer pays a dividend on shares of Buyer Common Stock by the
issuance of additional shares of Buyer Common Stock, or effects a subdivision
or combination or consolidation of the outstanding shares of Buyer Common
Stock (by reclassification or otherwise) into a greater or lesser number of
shares of Buyer Common Stock, then in each such case, (i) the number of
Contingent Shares shall be adjusted by multiplying such amount by a fraction,
the numerator of which is the number of shares of Buyer Common Stock
(including any other shares so reclassified as Buyer Common Stock)
outstanding immediately after such event and the denominator of which is the
number of shares of Buyer Common Stock that were outstanding immediately
prior to such event, and (ii) the Buyer Common Stock price value set forth in
_Section 2.7(a)(ii)_ above shall be appropriately adjusted to provide to the
Midco Equityholders the same economic effect as contemplated by this
Agreement prior to such event.

  



   

13

 



    



  

(e) The Parties agree that issuance and delivery of the Contingent Shares
shall be treated by the Parties for income Tax purposes as an adjustment to
the Merger Consideration, except as otherwise required by Legal Requirements.

  



  

Section 2.8. _Facilitation Fee_. At the Closing, Cowen and Company, LLC or
its assigns shall be entitled to receive the amounts set forth below
(collectively, the " _Facilitation Fee_ "):

  



  

(a) an amount in cash equal to $3,800,000, payable by the Buyer by wire
transfer of immediately available funds to the account designated by Cowen
and Company, LLC;

  



  

(b) an aggregate of 796,875 Founder Shares, transferred from the Founders pro
rata; and

  



  

(c) an aggregate of up to an additional 478,125 Founder Shares transferred
from the Founders pro rata if the Buyer requests in writing assistance from
Cowen and Company, LLC or an Affiliate of the Company to locate additional
investors to purchase shares of Buyer Common Stock or otherwise secure
sufficient additional capital to enable Buyer to satisfy the Minimum Cash
Closing Condition, with the number of additional Founder Shares transferred
to be determined as follows: the _product_ of (i) 478,125 Founder Shares and
(ii) the _quotient_ of (x) the actual dollar amount of capital invested in
Buyer directly attributable to the efforts of Cowen and Company, LLC _divided
by_ (y) the Adjusted Minimum Cash Closing Amount.

  



  

 _provided_ ,  _that_ , for a period of one (1) year after the Closing, all
Founder Shares so transferred shall remain in escrow and continue to be
subject to the restrictions on transfer applicable to such shares as set forth
in the Final Prospectus.

  



  

Section 2.9. _Buyer Committee; Company Representative_.

  



  

(a) Prior to the Closing, the board of directors of Buyer shall appoint a
committee (" _Buyer Committee_ ") consisting of one or more of its then
members to act on behalf of Buyer to take all necessary actions and make all
decisions pursuant to this Agreement regarding matters related to the
Contemplated Transactions as may be required after the Closing Date. In the
event of a vacancy in the Buyer Committee, the board of directors of Buyer,
or after the consummation of the Merger, a majority of those Persons who
served on Buyer's board of directors immediately prior to the Closing Date,
shall appoint as a successor some other Person who would qualify as an
"independent" director of Buyer and who has not had any relationship with
the Company prior to the Closing.

  



   

14

 



    



  

(b) The Company Equityholders and the Midco Equityholders have designated
Rohit Manocha as the initial representative (the " _Company Representative_
") to represent the interests of the Company Equityholders and the Midco
Equityholders to take all necessary actions and make all decisions pursuant
to this Agreement after the date hereof, giving consents and approvals
hereunder, and making those determinations hereunder that are specifically
reserved to the Company Representative by the terms hereof. If such Person
ceases to serve in such capacity, for any reason, the Company (or, following
the Distribution and the Closing, those members of the board of directors of
Buyer who were members of the board of directors of the Company prior to the
Distribution) shall appoint his successor. The Company Representative shall
(i) have no liability to Buyer, the Company, any Acquired Company,
any Subsidiary or Affiliate of the foregoing or any equityholder of any of
the foregoing (including any Company Equityholder and any Midco Equityholder)
with respect to actions taken or omitted to be taken in his capacity as the
Company Representative, and (ii) be entitled to indemnification by the
Acquired Companies against any loss, liability, or expenses arising out of
actions taken or omitted to be taken in his capacity as the Company
Representative.

  



  

Section 2.10. _Distribution_. Effective immediately prior to the Effective
Time, the Company will distribute one hundred percent (100%) of the issued
and outstanding Midco Shares to the Company Equityholders, and the Company
Equityholders' ownership of such Midco Shares shall be reflected on the books
and records of Midco.

  



  

Section 2.11. _The Second Merger_. Immediately after the Effective Time and
subject to and upon the terms and conditions of this Agreement and the
applicable provisions of the DGCL, Midco will merge with and into the Buyer
(the direct parent of Midco), the separate corporate existence of Midco shall
cease, and the Buyer shall continue as the surviving company after the Second
Merger. The Second Merger will be consummated immediately upon the filing of
a Certificate of Merger with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware,
or at such other time as may be agreed by the Buyer and the Company in writing
and specified in such filings (the " _Second Merger Closing_ "). The effect
of the Second Merger will be as provided in this Agreement, the
Certificate of Merger, and the applicable provisions of the DGCL. Without
limiting the generality of the foregoing, and subject thereto, at the Second
Merger Closing, all of the property, rights, privileges, powers, franchises,
debts, liabilities, and duties of Midco shall vest in the Buyer. The Second
Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation and Amended and Restated
Bylaws of the Buyer, in the forms attached as _Exhibit B_ and _Exhibit C_
hereto, respectively, shall be the Organizational Documents of the surviving
company.

 REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES REGARDING 
 THE ACQUIRED COMPANIES

  



  

In order to induce the Buyer to enter into and perform this Agreement and to
consummate the Contemplated Transactions, the Company, for itself and on
behalf of the Acquired Companies, hereby represents and warrants to the Buyer
as follows, in each case except as set forth on the Company Disclosure

jurisdiction of organization. The Company and each of the Acquired Companies
is duly qualified to do business and is in good standing in each jurisdiction
in which it owns or leases Real Property or conducts business and is required
to so qualify except where the failure to so qualify has not had, and would
not reasonably be expected to have, a Material Adverse Effect. Each
jurisdiction in which the Company and the Acquired Companies are so licensed
or qualified is listed in _Section 3.1_ of the Company Disclosure Schedule.
The Company and each of the Acquired Companies has all requisite power and

and delivery of this Agreement by each of the Company and Midco and the
consummation by the Company and Midco of the Contemplated Transactions have
been, or will be, duly and validly authorized by all necessary corporate
action, and no other corporate proceedings on the part of the Company or
Midco are necessary to authorize this Agreement or to consummate the
Contemplated Transactions. This Agreement has been duly and validly executed
and delivered by the Company and Midco and, assuming due authorization,
execution, and delivery thereof by the other Parties, constitutes the legal
and binding obligation of the Company and Midco, enforceable against the
Company and Midco in accordance with its terms, except as may be limited by
bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization or other similar laws affecting the
enforcement of creditors' rights generally and by general principles of
equity.

Company or any of the Acquired Companies;

  



   

16

 



    



  

(b) result in a breach or violation of, or constitute a default (or an event

or require any action by (including any authorization, consent or approval)
or notice to, or increase any payment to, any Person under, any of the terms,
conditions or provisions of (i) any Disclosed Contract (except to the extent

action would not delay or impair the ability the Company to enter into this
Agreement or to consummate the Contemplated Transactions) or (ii) the
Organizational Documents of the Company or any of the Acquired Companies;

in violation of any preemptive or subscription rights, and are not subject to
any preemptive or subscription rights that will survive the Closing Date,

Equityholders have no obligation to make further payments for their purchase
of Company Units or contributions to the Company by reason of their ownership
of Company Units or their status as members of the Company. The Company has
no issued or outstanding Equity Interests other than such Equity Interests
that are set forth on _Section 3.5_ of the Company Disclosure Schedule, and
the Company does not hold any units of its Equity Interests in its treasury,

granted in agreements entered into in connection with the Reorganization that
will be terminated at or prior to Closing, or (ii) any warrants, equity
appreciation rights, phantom units, or other securities convertible into or
exercisable or exchangeable for any Equity Interests in the Company. Except
for the Contemplated Transactions, there is no Contractual Obligation to
which the Company is party, or provision in the Organizational Documents of
the Company, which obligates the Company to purchase, redeem or otherwise
acquire, or make any payment (including any dividend or distribution) in
respect of, any Equity Interest in the Company, except for obligations
included in agreements entered into in connection with the Reorganization that
will be terminated at or prior to Closing. The Company has not granted any
rights with respect to registration under the Securities Act of any
Equity Interests in the Company, except for rights granted in agreements
entered into in connection with the Reorganization that will be terminated at
or prior to Closing. There is no voting trust, rights plan, anti-takeover
plan, or other agreement or understanding to which the Company is a party or
by which the Company is bound with respect to any Equity Interests of the
Company, except as provided in agreements entered into in connection with the
Reorganization that will not survive Closing.

  



   

17

 



    



  

(iv) Except as set forth on _Section 3.5_ of the Company Disclosure Schedule,
neither the Company nor any Acquired Company has any outstanding bonds,
debentures, notes, or other obligations the holders of which have the right to
vote (or which are convertible into or exercisable or exchangeable for
securities having the right to vote) with the holders of Equity Interests of
the Company on any matter.

  



  

(v) No outstanding Equity Interests of the Company are unvested or subjected
to a repurchase option, risk of forfeiture, or other condition under any
applicable agreement with the Company, except as provided in agreements
entered into in connection with the Reorganization that will not survive
Closing, and which will be treated as set forth in _Section 2.3(a)_.

  



  

(b)  _Subsidiaries_. The Company has no direct or indirect Subsidiaries other
than those listed in _Section 3.5_ of the Company Disclosure Schedule. Except

owns all of the outstanding equity securities of the Subsidiaries, free and
clear of all Encumbrances other than Permitted Encumbrances, either directly
or indirectly through one or more other Subsidiaries; _provided_ , that
references in this sentence to the Company shall instead refer to Midco
following the Distribution. All of the issued and outstanding Equity Interests
of each Acquired Company (1) have been duly authorized and, if in a
corporation, are validly issued, fully paid and non-assessable, (2) are not
subject to any preemptive or subscription rights that will survive the
Closing Date, and (3) are not subject to any Encumbrances other than
Permitted Encumbrances. As of the date hereof, all of the issued and
outstanding Equity Interests of each Acquired Company are held, directly or
indirectly, of record by the Person(s) and in the amounts set forth on
_Section 3.5_ of the Company Disclosure Schedule. Each such Acquired Company
has no issued or outstanding Equity Interests other than such Equity
Interests that are set forth on _Section 3.5_ of the Company Disclosure
Schedule, and each Acquired Company does not hold any of its Equity Interests
in its treasury, in each case, as of the date hereof. No Acquired Company has
granted any preemptive rights or other similar rights in respect of any
Equity Interests in such Acquired Company, except for rights granted in
agreements entered into in connection with the Reorganization that will not
survive the Closing. In connection with the Contemplated Transactions, there
is no Contractual Obligation to which any Acquired Company is party, or
provision in the Organizational Documents of any such Acquired Company, which
obligates any such Acquired Company to purchase, redeem or otherwise acquire,
or make any payment (including any dividend or distribution) in respect of,
any Equity Interest in such Acquired Company, except as provided in
agreements entered into in connection with the Reorganization that will not
survive closing. Except as terminated prior to the Closing, no Acquired
Company has granted any rights with respect to registration under the
Securities Act of any Equity Interests in the Company. Except for its direct
and indirect Equity Interests in the Acquired Companies, the Company does not
own, directly or indirectly, any ownership, equity, profits or voting
interest in any Person or have any Contractual Obligation as of the date
hereof under which it may become obligated to make any future investment in
or capital contribution to any other entity.

  



   

18

 



    



  

Section 3.6. _Compliance_. The Company and each Acquired Company is in
compliance with all, and is not in violation of any, Legal Requirements with
respect to the conduct of its business, or the ownership or operation of its
business, and the businesses and activities of the Company and each Acquired
Company have not been and are not being conducted in violation of any Legal
Requirements, except, in each case, for failures to comply or violations
which, individually or in the aggregate, have not had and are not
reasonably likely to have a Material Adverse Effect. No written notice of
material non-compliance with any material Legal Requirement has been received
by the Company or any of the Acquired Companies (and the Company has no
Knowledge of any such notice delivered to any other Person). No Acquired
Company is in violation of any term of any Contractual Obligation to which it
is a party, except as would not, individually or in the aggregate, have a
Material Adverse Effect.

Company Disclosure Schedule identifies all patents, patent applications,

(c)  _IP Contracts_. _Section 3.11(c)_ of the Company Disclosure Schedule
identifies each Contractual Obligation the loss or disruption of which may be
reasonably expected to cause a Material Adverse Effect (i) under which any of
the Acquired Companies use or license Intellectual Property Rights that any
Person besides the Acquired Companies own other than off-the-shelf
software (the " _Inbound IP Contracts_ ") and (ii) under which any of the
Acquired Companies have granted to any Person any right or interest in any

(d)  _Company IP._ Except as set forth on _Section 3.11(d)_ of the Company
Disclosure Schedule, and as would not be reasonably expected to have a
Material Adverse Effect, the Acquired Companies own or otherwise have the
right to use all Intellectual Property Rights required or necessary for the
conduct of the Business, free and clear of all Encumbrances other than
Permitted Encumbrances. No Company Intellectual Property Rights are subject
to (i) any Action, Contractual Obligation, or Governmental Order that
restricts the use, transfer or licensing thereof by the Acquired Companies
(other than restrictions contained in the IP Contracts disclosed in _Section

fact or omit to state any material fact necessary to make the statements
therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not
misleading, then the Company shall promptly inform the Buyer of such
information, event or circumstance and the Buyer shall promptly file an

of director's recommendation that the holders of Buyer Common Stock vote in
favor of the adoption of this Agreement and the approval of the Contemplated
Transactions.

understandings with the Buyer (whether in the past, present or future), and
will not seek recourse against the Trust Fund at any time for any reason
whatsoever; _provided_ , that: (a) nothing herein shall serve to limit or
prohibit the Company's right to pursue a claim against the Buyer pursuant to
this Agreement for legal relief against monies or other assets of the Buyer
held outside the Trust Fund or for specific performance or other equitable
relief in connection with the Contemplated Transactions and (b) nothing
herein shall serve to limit or prohibit any claims that the Company may have

purpose of preventing or prevents the Company from so filing or pursuing any

been required to be disclosed under this Agreement, (c) gives such Party
any reason to believe that any of the conditions to the obligations of the

or the validity or enforceability of the offending term or provision in any

Section 11.9. _Jurisdiction; Venue; Service of Process_.

  



  

(a) _Jurisdiction_. Each of the Parties to this Agreement, by its execution
hereof, (i) hereby irrevocably submits to the exclusive jurisdiction of the
Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware or any United States District Court
located in the State of Delaware, or, if neither of such courts has subject
matter jurisdiction, any state court of the State of Delaware for the purpose
of any Action relating to or arising in whole or in part under or in
connection with this Agreement, the Registration Rights Agreement or the
Contemplated Transactions (in each case, whether in law or in equity, whether
in contract or in tort, by statute or otherwise), (ii) hereby waives to the
extent not prohibited by applicable Legal Requirements, and agrees not to
assert, by way of motion, as a defense or otherwise, in any such Action, any
claim that it is not subject personally to the jurisdiction of the above-named
courts, that its property is exempt or immune from attachment or execution,
that any such Action brought in one of the above-named courts should be
dismissed on grounds of _forum non conveniens_ , should be transferred or
removed to any court other than one of the above-named courts, or should be
stayed by reason of the pendency of some other Action in any other court other
than one of the above-named courts or that this Agreement, the Registration
Rights Agreement or the subject matter hereof or thereof may not be enforced
in or by such court and (iii) hereby agrees not to commence any such Action
other than before one of the above-named courts. Notwithstanding the previous
sentence, a Party may commence any Action in a court other than the above-
named courts solely for the purpose of enforcing an order or judgment issued
by one of the above-named courts.

  



    

69

 



    



  

(b) _Venue_. Each of the Parties to this Agreement agrees that for any Action
among any of the Parties relating to or arising in whole or in part under or
in connection with this Agreement, the Registration Rights Agreement or the
Contemplated Transactions (in each case, whether in law or in equity, whether
in contract or in tort, by statute or otherwise), such Party will bring such
Action only in the State of Delaware. Notwithstanding the previous sentence a
Party may commence any Action in a court other than the above-named
courts solely for the purpose of enforcing an order or judgment issued by one
of the above-named courts. Each Party hereto further waives any claim and
will not assert that venue should properly lie in any other location within
the selected jurisdiction.

  



  

(c) _Service of Process_. Each of the Parties to this Agreement hereby (i)
consents to service of process in any Action among any of the Parties hereto
relating to or arising in whole or in part under or in connection with this
Agreement, the Registration Rights Agreement or the Contemplated Transactions
(in each case, whether in law or in equity, whether in contract or in tort, by
statute or otherwise) in any manner permitted by Delaware law, (ii) agrees
that service of process made in accordance with clause (i) or made by
registered or certified mail, return receipt requested, at its address
specified pursuant to _Section 11.1_ , will constitute good and valid
service of process in any such Action and (iii) waives and agrees not to
assert (by way of motion, as a defense, or otherwise) in any such Action any
claim that service of process made in accordance with clause (i) or (ii) does
not constitute good and valid service of process.

  



  

Section 11.10. _Scope of Representations and Warranties_. Inclusion of a
matter on the Buyer Disclosure Schedule or Company Disclosure
Schedule, respectively, with respect to a representation or warranty which
addresses matters being material or having a Material Adverse Effect or Buyer
Material Adverse Effect, as the case may be, will not be deemed an indication
that such matter does, or may, be material or have a Material Adverse Effect
or Buyer Material Adverse Effect, as the case may be. Matters may be disclosed
on the Buyer Disclosure Schedule or Company Disclosure Schedule,
respectively, to this Agreement for purposes of information only.
Information disclosed in any Buyer Disclosure Schedule or Company Disclosure
Schedule will constitute a disclosure for all purposes under this Agreement
to the extent it is reasonably apparent that the information is relevant for
such other purposes, notwithstanding any reference to a specific section, and
all such information will be deemed to qualify the entire Agreement and not
just such section.

  



    

70

 



    



  

Section 11.11. _No Survival of Representations and Warranties_. The
representations and warranties of the Company, individually and on behalf of
the Acquired Companies, set forth in this Agreement or in any certificate,
statement or instrument delivered pursuant to this Agreement, shall terminate
at the Closing or, if earlier, upon termination of this Agreement in
accordance with its terms. The representations and warranties of the Buyer
and Merger Sub set forth in this Agreement or in any certificate, statement or
instrument delivered pursuant to this Agreement shall terminate at the
Closing or, if earlier, upon termination of this Agreement in accordance with
its terms. Prior to the Closing, the Buyer may, in its sole discretion, obtain
and bind a representation and warranty insurance policy (the " _R andW
Insurance Policy_") with respect to the representations and warranties of the
Company in  _Article III_ of this Agreement. The Buyer shall pay all of the
costs to obtain the RandW Insurance Policy. For the avoidance of doubt, the RandW
Insurance Policy, if any, shall be the Buyer's sole recourse for any breach of
the representations and warranties of the Company, individually and on behalf
of the Acquired Companies, set forth in this Agreement or in any
certificate, statement or instrument delivered pursuant to this Agreement.
Neither the Company Equityholders nor the Midco Equityholders shall have any
liability for any breach of any representation or warranty in this Agreement
or of any covenant of any other Person herein.

  



  

Section 11.12. _Waiver of Jury Trial_. TO THE EXTENT NOT PROHIBITED BY
APPLICABLE LEGAL REQUIREMENT THAT CANNOT BE WAIVED, THE PARTIES HEREBY WAIVE,
AND COVENANT THAT THEY WILL NOT ASSERT (WHETHER AS PLAINTIFF, DEFENDANT OR
OTHERWISE), ANY RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY ACTION ARISING IN WHOLE OR IN
PART UNDER OR IN CONNECTION WITH THIS AGREEMENT, THE REGISTRATION RIGHTS
AGREEMENT OR ANY OF THE CONTEMPLATED TRANSACTIONS, WHETHER NOW EXISTING OR
HEREAFTER ARISING, AND WHETHER SOUNDING IN CONTRACT, TORT OR OTHERWISE.
THE PARTIES AGREE THAT ANY OF THEM MAY FILE A COPY OF THIS PARAGRAPH WITH ANY
COURT AS WRITTEN EVIDENCE OF THE KNOWING, VOLUNTARY AND BARGAINED-FOR
AGREEMENT AMONG THE PARTIES IRREVOCABLY TO WAIVE THEIR RESPECTIVE RIGHTS TO
TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY ACTION WHATSOEVER BETWEEN OR AMONG THEM RELATING TO THIS
AGREEMENT, THE REGISTRATION RIGHTS AGREEMENT OR ANY OF THE CONTEMPLATED
TRANSACTIONS AND THAT SUCH ACTIONS WILL INSTEAD BE TRIED IN A COURT OF
COMPETENT JURISDICTION BY A JUDGE SITTING WITHOUT A JURY.

  



  

Section 11.13. _Specific Enforcement_. Each of the Parties hereto agrees that
irreparable harm for which monetary damages, even if available, would not be
an adequate remedy, would occur in the event that it does not fully and timely
perform its obligations under or in connection with this Agreement (including
failing to take such actions as are required of it hereunder to consummate
this Agreement and the Closing) in accordance with its terms. Each of the
Parties hereto acknowledges and agrees that (i) the other Parties will be
entitled to an injunction, specific performance or other equitable relief, to
prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and
provisions hereof, without proof of damages and without posting a bond, this
being in addition to any other remedy to which such other Parties are
entitled under this Agreement and (ii) the right to obtain an injunction,
specific performance, or other equitable relief is an integral part of the
Contemplated Transactions and without that right, none of the Parties would
have entered into this Agreement. In furtherance of the foregoing, the Parties
hereby further acknowledge and agree that prior to the Closing, the Company
shall be entitled to specific performance to cause Buyer to consummate the
Contemplated Transactions including to effect the Closing in accordance with
_Article II,_ on the terms and subject to the conditions in this Agreement.
Each of the Parties agrees that it will not oppose the granting of an
injunction, specific performance or other equitable relief on the basis that
(x) the Company has an adequate remedy at law or (y) an award of specific
performance is not an appropriate remedy for any reason at law or equity.

  



    

71

 



    



  

Section 11.14. _Non-Recourse_. This Agreement may only be enforced against,
and any Action that may be based upon, in respect of, arise under, out of or
by reason of, be connected with or relate in any manner to this Agreement, or
the negotiation, execution, performance or breach (whether willful,
intentional, unintentional or otherwise and whether sounding in contract, tort
or otherwise), of this Agreement, including, without limitation, any
representation or warranty made or alleged to have been made in, in connection
with or as an inducement to, this Agreement (each of such above-described
legal, equitable or other theories or sources of liability, a "
_Recourse Theory_ ") may only be made or asserted against (and are expressly
limited to) the Persons that are expressly identified as the Parties hereto
in the preamble to and signature pages of this Agreement and solely in their
capacities as such. No Person who is not a Party hereto (including, without
limitation, (a) any former, current or future direct or indirect equity
holder, controlling Person, management company, incorporator, member,
partner, manager, director, officer, employee, agent, Affiliate, attorney
or representative of, and any financial advisor or lender to (all above-
described Persons in this subclause (a), collectively, " _Affiliated Persons_
") a party hereto or any Affiliate of such party, and (b) any Affiliated
Persons of such Affiliated Persons but specifically excluding the parties
hereto will have any liability whatsoever in respect of, based upon or arising
out of any Recourse Theory. Without limiting the rights of any Party hereto
against the other Parties hereto as set forth herein, in no event will any
Party hereto, any of its Affiliates or any Person claiming by, through or on
behalf of any of them institute any Action under any Recourse Theory against
any non-Party.

2.1.1. _Request for Registration_. At any time and from time to time
following expiration of the Lock-Up Period, (i) a majority-in-interest of the
holders of Registrable Securities, or (ii) any of Cantor Fitzgerald and Co. ("
_Cantor_ "), Chardan Capital Markets, LLC (" _Chardan_ "), TriArtisan TGIF
Partners LLC, MJTA Associates III TGIF LLC (together with TriArtisan TGIF
Partners LLC, " _TriArtisan_ "), or MFP Partners, L.P. (" _MFP_ "), or any of
their respective transferees who have acquired at least 50% of the
Registrable Securities held by one of such parties on the date hereof and
executed a joinder to this Agreement, may make a written demand for
registration under the Securities Act of all or part of their Registrable
Securities (a " _Demand Registration_ "). Any Demand Registration shall
specify the number of shares of Registrable Securities proposed to be sold
and the intended method(s) of distribution thereof. The Company will notify
all holders of Registrable Securities of the demand, and each holder of
Registrable Securities who wishes to include all or a portion of such holder's
Registrable Securities in the Demand Registration (each such holder including
shares of Registrable Securities in such registration, a " _Demanding Holder_
") shall so notify the Company within twenty (20) days after the receipt by
the holder of the notice from the Company. Upon any such request, the
Demanding Holders shall be entitled to have their Registrable Securities
included in the Demand Registration, subject to Section 2.1.4 and the
provisos set forth in Section 3.1.1. The Company shall not be obligated to
effect more than an aggregate of five (5) Demand Registrations under this
Section 2.1.1 in respect of all Registrable Securities; provided, that each
of Cantor, Chardan, TriArtisan and MFP shall be entitled to make one (1)
Demand Registration.

  



  

2.1.2. _Effective Registration_. A registration will not count as a Demand
Registration until the Registration Statement filed with the Commission with
respect to such Demand Registration has been declared effective and the
Company has complied with all of its obligations under this Agreement with
respect thereto; provided, however, that if, after such Registration
Statement has been declared effective, the offering of Registrable Securities
pursuant to a Demand Registration is interfered with by any stop order or
injunction of the Commission or any other governmental agency or court, the
Registration Statement with respect to such Demand Registration will be deemed
not to have been declared effective, unless and until (i) such stop order or
injunction is removed, rescinded or otherwise terminated, and (ii) a
majority-in-interest of the Demanding Holders thereafter elect to continue the
offering; provided, further, that the Company shall not be obligated to file
a second Registration Statement until a Registration Statement that has been
filed is counted as a Demand Registration or is terminated.

  



    

95

 



    



  

2.1.3. _Underwritten Offering_. If a majority-in-interest of the Demanding
Holders so elect and such holders so advise the Company as part of their
written demand for a Demand Registration, the offering of such Registrable
Securities pursuant to such Demand Registration shall be in the form of an
underwritten offering. In such event, the right of any holder to include its
Registrable Securities in such registration shall be conditioned upon such
holder's participation as a selling shareholder in such underwritten offering
and the inclusion of such holder's Registrable Securities in the underwriting
to the extent provided herein. All Demanding Holders proposing to distribute
their Registrable Securities through such underwritten offering shall enter
into an underwriting agreement in customary form with the Underwriter or
Underwriters selected for such underwriting by a majority-in-interest of the
holders initiating the Demand Registration.

  



  

2.1.4. _Reduction of Offering_. If the managing Underwriter or Underwriters
for a Demand Registration that is to be an underwritten offering advises the
Company and the Demanding Holders in writing that the dollar amount or number
of shares of Registrable Securities which the Demanding Holders desire to
sell, taken together with all other shares of Common Stock or other securities
which the Company desires to sell and the shares of Common Stock, if any, as
to which registration has been requested pursuant to written contractual
piggy-back registration rights held by other stockholders of the Company who
desire to sell, exceeds the maximum dollar amount or maximum number of shares
that can be sold in such offering without adversely affecting the proposed
offering price, the timing, the distribution method, or the probability of
success of such offering (such maximum dollar amount or maximum number of
shares, as applicable, the " _Maximum Number of Shares_ "), then the Company
shall include in such registration: (i) first, the Registrable Securities
as to which Demand Registration has been requested by the Demanding Holders
(pro rata in accordance with the number of shares that each such Person has
requested be included in such registration, regardless of the number of shares
held by each such Person (such proportion is referred to herein as " _Pro
Rata_ ")) that can be sold without exceeding the Maximum Number of Shares;
(ii) second, to the extent that the Maximum Number of Shares has not been
reached under the foregoing clause (i), the shares of Common Stock or other
securities that the Company desires to sell that can be sold without exceeding
the Maximum Number of Shares; and (iii) third, to the extent that the Maximum
Number of Shares has not been reached under the foregoing clauses (i) and
(ii), the shares of Common Stock or other securities for the account of other
persons that the Company is obligated to register pursuant to other written
contractual arrangements with such persons and that can be sold without
exceeding the Maximum Number of Shares.

  



  

2.1.5. _Withdrawal_. If a majority-in-interest of the Demanding Holders
disapprove of the terms of any underwriting or are not entitled to include all
of their Registrable Securities in any offering, such majority-in-interest of
the Demanding Holders may elect to withdraw from such offering by giving
written notice to the Company and the managing Underwriter or Underwriters of
their request to withdraw prior to the effectiveness of the Registration
Statement filed with the Commission with respect to such Demand Registration.
If the majority-in-interest of the Demanding Holders withdraws from a
proposed offering relating to a Demand Registration, then such registration
shall not count as a Demand Registration provided for in Section 2.1.

  



    

96

 



    



  

2.1.6. _Other Registration Rights_. From and after the date hereof, the
Company will not, without the prior written consent of a majority-in-interest
of the holders of Registrable Securities, enter into or amend any agreement
with any current or future holder of any securities of the Company that would
allow such current or future holder to require the Company to include
securities in any registration statement filed by the Company for such holder
on a basis other than expressly subordinate to the rights of the holders of
Registrable Securities hereunder.

  



  

2.2. _Piggy-Back Registration_.

  



  

2.2.1. _Piggy-Back Rights_. If at any time after the expiration of the Lock-
Up Period the Company proposes to file a Registration Statement under the
Securities Act with respect to an offering of Equity Securities, or
securities or other obligations exercisable or exchangeable for, or
convertible into, Equity Securities, by the Company for its own account
and/or for shareholders of the Company for their account, other than a
Registration Statement (i) filed in connection with any employee stock option
or other benefit plan, (ii) for an exchange offer or offering of securities
solely to the Company's existing shareholders, (iii) for an offering of debt
that is convertible into equity securities of the Company (iv) for a dividend
reinvestment plan or (v) filed in connection with a business
combination transaction involving the Company, including a merger, asset
acquisition, share purchase, recapitalization, reorganization or
other similar type of transaction, then the Company shall (x) give written
notice of such proposed filing to the holders of Registrable Securities as
soon as practicable but in no event less than twenty (20) days before the
anticipated filing date, which notice shall describe the amount and type of
securities to be included in such offering, the intended method(s) of
distribution, and the name of the proposed managing Underwriter or
Underwriters, if any, of the offering, and (y) offer to the holders of
Registrable Securities in such notice the opportunity to register the sale of
such number of shares of Registrable Securities as such holders may
request in writing within twenty (20) days following receipt of such notice
(a " _Piggy-Back Registration_ "). The Company shall cause such Registrable
Securities to be included in such registration and shall use its best efforts
to cause the managing Underwriter or Underwriters of a proposed underwritten
offering to permit the Registrable Securities requested to be included in a
Piggy-Back Registration on the same terms and conditions as any similar
securities of the Company and to permit the sale or other disposition of such
Registrable Securities in accordance with the intended method(s) of
distribution thereof. All holders of Registrable Securities proposing to
distribute their securities through a Piggy-Back Registration that involves a
managing Underwriter or Underwriters shall enter into an underwriting
agreement in customary form with the Underwriter or Underwriters selected
for such Piggy-Back Registration.

  



    

97

 



    



  

2.2.2. _Reduction of Offering_. If the managing Underwriter or Underwriters
for a Piggy-Back Registration that is to be an underwritten offering advises
the Company and the holders of Registrable Securities in writing that the
dollar amount or number of shares of Common Stock which the Company
desires to sell, taken together with shares of Common Stock, if any, as to
which registration has been demanded pursuant to written
contractual arrangements with persons other than the holders of Registrable
Securities hereunder, the Registrable Securities as to which registration has
been requested under this Section 2.2, and the shares of Common Stock, if any,
as to which registration has been requested pursuant to the written
contractual piggy-back registration rights of other shareholders of the
Company, exceeds the Maximum Number of Shares, then the Company shall include
in any such registration:

  



  

a) If the registration is undertaken for the Company's account: (A) first,
the shares of Common Stock or other securities that the Company desires to
sell that can be sold without exceeding the Maximum Number of Shares; (B)
second, to the extent that the Maximum Number of Shares has not been reached
under the foregoing clause (A), the shares of Common Stock or other
securities, if any, comprised of Registrable Securities, as to which
registration has been requested pursuant to this Section 2.2, Pro Rata, that
can be sold without exceeding the Maximum Number of Shares; and (C) third, to
the extent that the Maximum Number of Shares has not been reached under the
foregoing clauses (A) and (B), the shares of Common Stock or other securities
for the account of other persons that the Company is obligated to
register pursuant to written contractual piggy-back registration rights with
such persons and that can be sold without exceeding the Maximum Number of
Shares;

  



  

b) If the registration is a "demand" registration undertaken at the demand of
persons other than any of the holders of Registrable Securities: (A) first,
the shares of Common Stock or other securities for the account of the
demanding persons that can be sold without exceeding the Maximum Number of
Shares; (B) second, to the extent that the Maximum Number of Shares has not
been reached under the foregoing clause (A), the shares of Common Stock or
other securities that the Company desires to sell that can be sold without
exceeding the Maximum Number of Shares; (C) third, to the extent that the
Maximum Number of Shares has not been reached under the foregoing clauses (A)
and (B), the shares of Common Stock or other securities comprised of
Registrable Securities, as to which registration has been requested pursuant
to this Section 2.2, Pro Rata, that can be sold without exceeding the Maximum
Number of Shares; and (D) fourth, to the extent that the Maximum Number of
Shares has not been reached under the foregoing clauses (A), (B) and (C), the
shares of Common Stock or other securities for the account of other persons
that the Company is obligated to register pursuant to other
written contractual arrangements with such persons and that can be sold
without exceeding the Maximum Number of Shares.

  



  

2.2.3. _Withdrawal_. Any holder of Registrable Securities may elect to
withdraw such holder's request for inclusion of Registrable Securities in any
Piggy-Back Registration by giving written notice to the Company of such
request to withdraw prior to the effectiveness of the applicable Registration
Statement. The Company (whether on its own determination or as the result of
a withdrawal by persons making a demand pursuant to written
contractual obligations) may withdraw a Registration Statement at any time
prior to the effectiveness of such Registration Statement.
Notwithstanding any such withdrawal, the Company shall pay all expenses
incurred by the holders of Registrable Securities in connection with
such Piggy-Back Registration as provided in Section 3.3.

  



    

98

 



    



  

2.2.4. _Registrations on Form S-3_. The holders of Registrable Securities may
at any time and from time to time following expiration of the Lock-Up Period
request in writing that the Company register the resale of any or all of such
Registrable Securities on Form S-3 or any similar short-form
registration which may be available at such time (" _Form S-3_ "). Upon
receipt of such written request, the Company will promptly give written
notice of the proposed registration to all other holders of Registrable
Securities, and, as soon as practicable thereafter, effect the registration
of all or such portion of such holder's or holders' Registrable Securities as
are specified in such request, together with all or such portion of the
Registrable Securities or other securities of the Company, if any, of any
other holder or holders joining in such request as are specified in a written
request given within twenty (20) days after receipt of such written notice
from the Company; provided, however, that the Company shall not be obligated
to effect any such registration pursuant to this Section 2.2: (i) if Form S-3
is not available for such offering; or (ii) if the holders of the Registrable
Securities, together with the holders of any other securities of the Company
entitled to inclusion in such registration, propose to sell Registrable
Securities and such other securities (if any) at any aggregate price to the
public of less than $500,000. Registrations effected pursuant to this Section
2.2 shall not be counted as Demand Registrations effected pursuant to Section
2.1.

  



  

3\. _REGISTRATION PROCEDURES_.

  



  

3.1. _Filings; Information_. Whenever the Company is required to effect the
registration of any Registrable Securities pursuant to Section 2, the Company
shall use its best efforts to effect the registration and sale of such
Registrable Securities in accordance with the intended method(s) of
distribution thereof as expeditiously as practicable, and in connection with
any such request:

  



  

3.1.1. _Filing Registration Statement_. The Company shall use its best
efforts to, as expeditiously as possible after receipt of a request for a
Demand Registration pursuant to Section 2.1, prepare and file with the

form shall be available for the sale of all Registrable Securities to be

distribution thereof, and shall use its best efforts to cause such
Registration Statement to become effective and use its best efforts to keep it
effective for the period required by Section 3.1.3; provided, however, that
the Company shall have the right to defer any Demand Registration for up to
thirty (30) days, and any Piggy Back Registration for such period as may be

Registration relates, in each case if the Company shall furnish to the holders

would be materially detrimental to the Company and its shareholders for such
Registration Statement to be effected at such time; provided

right set forth in the immediately preceding proviso more than twice in any

Statement (in each case including all exhibits thereto and documents
incorporated by reference therein), the prospectus included in such

method(s) of distribution set forth in such Registration Statement or such
securities have been withdrawn.

  



  

3.1.4. _Notification_. After the filing of a Registration Statement, the

Company shall take all actions required to prevent the entry of such stop
order or to remove it if entered); and (iv) any request by the Commission for
any amendment or supplement to such Registration Statement or any prospectus
relating thereto or for additional information or of the occurrence of an
event requiring the preparation of a supplement or amendment to such
prospectus so that, as thereafter delivered to the purchasers of the
securities covered by such Registration Statement, such prospectus will not
contain an untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material
fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein
not misleading, and promptly make available to the holders of Registrable
Securities included in such Registration Statement any such supplement
or amendment; except that before filing with the Commission a Registration
Statement or prospectus or any amendment or supplement thereto, including
documents incorporated by reference, the Company shall furnish to the holders
of Registrable Securities included in such Registration Statement and to the
legal counsel for any such holders, copies of all such documents proposed to
be filed sufficiently in advance of filing to provide such holders and legal
counsel with a reasonable opportunity to review such documents and comment
thereon, and the Company shall not file any Registration Statement or
prospectus or amendment or supplement thereto, including documents
incorporated by reference, to which such holders or their legal counsel shall
reasonably object.

  



  

3.1.5. _State Securities Laws Compliance_. The Company shall use its best
efforts to (i) register or qualify the Registrable Securities covered by the
Registration Statement under such securities or "blue sky" laws of such
jurisdictions in the United States as the holders of Registrable
Securities included in such Registration Statement (in light of their
intended plan of distribution) may request and (ii) take such
action necessary to cause such Registrable Securities covered by the
Registration Statement to be registered with or approved by such other
governmental authorities as may be necessary by virtue of the business and
operations of the Company and do any and all other acts and things that may
be necessary or advisable to enable the holders of Registrable Securities
included in such Registration Statement to consummate the disposition of such
Registrable Securities in such jurisdictions; provided, however, that the
Company shall not be required to qualify generally to do business in any
jurisdiction where it would not otherwise be required to qualify but for this

agreement which are made to or for the benefit of any Underwriters, to the
extent applicable, shall also be made to and for the benefit of the holders of
Registrable Securities included in such registration statement. No holder of
Registrable Securities included in such registration statement shall be
required to make any representations or warranties in the underwriting
agreement except, if applicable, with respect to such holder's organization,
good standing, authority, title to Registrable Securities, lack of conflict of
such sale with such holder's material agreements and organizational
documents, and with respect to written information relating to such holder
that such holder has furnished in writing expressly for inclusion in such
Registration Statement.

  



  

3.1.7. _Cooperation_. The principal executive officer of the Company, the
principal financial officer of the Company, the principal accounting officer

all other offering materials and related documents, and participation in
meetings with Underwriters, attorneys, accountants and potential investors.

holders of Registrable Securities included in such Registration Statement, any

documents and properties of the Company, as shall be necessary to enable them
to exercise their due diligence responsibility, and cause the Company's
officers, directors and employees to supply all information requested by any

the event no legal opinion is delivered to any Underwriter, the Company shall
furnish to each holder of Registrable Securities included in such Registration
Statement, at any time that such holder elects to use a prospectus, an
opinion of counsel to the Company to the effect that the

Registrable Securities included in any registration to be listed on such
exchanges or otherwise designated for trading in the same manner as similar
securities issued by the Company are then listed or designated or, if no
such similar securities are then listed or designated, in a manner
satisfactory to the holders of a majority of the Registrable
Securities included in such registration.

  



  

3.1.12. _Road Show_. If the registration involves the registration of
Registrable Securities involving gross proceeds in excess of $25,000,000, the

of the Company to participate in customary "road show" presentations that may
be reasonably requested by the Underwriter in any underwritten offering.

  



  

3.2. _Obligation to Suspend Distribution_. Upon receipt of any notice from
the Company of the happening of any event of the kind described in Section
3.1.4(iv), or, in the case of a resale registration on Form S-3 pursuant to
Section 2.3 hereof, upon any suspension by the Company, pursuant to a
written insider trading compliance program adopted by the Company's Board of
Directors, of the ability of all "insiders" covered by such program to
transact in the Company's securities because of the existence of material non-
public information, each holder of Registrable Securities included in any
registration shall immediately discontinue disposition of such
Registrable Securities pursuant to the Registration Statement covering such
Registrable Securities until such holder receives the supplemented or amended
prospectus contemplated by Section 3.1.4(iv) or the restriction on the ability
of "insiders" to transact in the Company's securities is removed, as
applicable, and, if so directed by the Company, each such holder will

4\. _INDEMNIFICATION AND CONTRIBUTION_.

  



  

4.1. _Indemnification by the Company_. The Company agrees to indemnify and
hold harmless each Investor and each other holder of Registrable Securities,
and each of their respective officers, employees, affiliates, directors,
partners, members, attorneys and agents, and each person, if any, who
controls an Investor and each other holder of Registrable Securities (within
the meaning of Section 15 of the Securities Act or Section 20 of the Exchange
Act) (each, an " _Investor Indemnified Party_ "), from and against any
expenses, losses, judgments, claims, damages or liabilities, whether joint or
several, arising out of or based upon any untrue statement (or
allegedly untrue statement) of a material fact contained in any Registration
Statement under which the sale of such Registrable Securities was registered
under the Securities Act, any preliminary prospectus, final prospectus or
summary prospectus contained in the Registration Statement, or any amendment
or supplement to such Registration Statement, or arising out of or based upon
any omission (or alleged omission) to state a material fact required to be
stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading,
or any violation by the Company of the Securities Act or any rule or
regulation promulgated thereunder applicable to the Company and relating to
action or inaction required of the Company in connection with any such
registration; and the Company shall promptly reimburse the Investor
Indemnified Party for any legal and any other expenses reasonably incurred by
such Investor Indemnified Party in connection with investigating and
defending any such expense, loss, judgment, claim, damage, liability or action
whether or not any such person is a party to any such claim or action and
including any and all legal and other expenses incurred in giving testimony
or furnishing documents in response to a subpoena or otherwise; provided,
however, that the Company will not be liable in any such case to the extent
that any such expense, loss, claim, damage or liability arises out of or is
based upon any untrue statement or allegedly untrue statement or omission or
alleged omission made in such Registration Statement, preliminary
prospectus, final prospectus, or summary prospectus, or any such amendment or
supplement, in reliance upon and in conformity with information furnished to
the Company, in writing, by such selling holder expressly for use therein. The
Company also shall indemnify any Underwriter of the Registrable Securities,
their officers, affiliates, directors, partners, members and agents and each
person who controls such Underwriter on substantially the same basis as that
of the indemnification provided above in this Section 4.1.

  



    

103

 



    



  

4.2. _Indemnification by Holders of Registrable Securities_. Subject to the
limitations set forth Section 4.4.3 hereof, each selling holder of Registrable
Securities will, in the event that any registration is being effected under
the Securities Act pursuant to this Agreement of any Registrable
Securities held by such selling holder, indemnify and hold harmless the
Company, each of its directors and officers and each Underwriter (if any),
and each other selling holder and each other person, if any, who controls
another selling holder or such Underwriter within the meaning of the
Securities Act, against any losses, claims, judgments, damages or liabilities,
whether joint or several, insofar as such losses, claims, judgments, damages
or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) arise out of or are based upon
any untrue statement or allegedly untrue statement of a material fact
contained in any Registration Statement under which the sale of
such Registrable Securities was registered under the Securities Act, any
preliminary prospectus, final prospectus or summary prospectus contained in
the Registration Statement, or any amendment or supplement to the Registration
Statement, or arise out of or are based upon any omission or the alleged
omission to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary
to make the statement therein not misleading, if the statement or omission
was made in reliance upon and in conformity with information furnished
in writing to the Company by such selling holder expressly for use therein,
and shall reimburse the Company, its directors and officers, and each other
selling holder or controlling person for any legal or other expenses
reasonably incurred by any of them in connection with investigation or
defending any such loss, claim, damage, liability or action. Each selling
holder's indemnification obligations hereunder shall be several and not joint
and shall be limited to the amount of any net proceeds actually received
by such selling holder.

  



  

4.3. _Conduct of Indemnification Proceeding_ s. Promptly after receipt by any
person of any notice of any loss, claim, damage or liability or any action in
respect of which indemnity may be sought pursuant to Section 4.1 or 4.2, such
person (the "Indemnified Party") shall, if a claim in respect thereof is to
be made against any other person for indemnification hereunder, notify such
other person (the "Indemnifying Party") in writing of the loss, claim,
judgment, damage, liability or action; provided, however, that the failure by
the Indemnified Party to notify the Indemnifying Party shall not relieve the
Indemnifying Party from any liability which the Indemnifying Party may
have to such Indemnified Party hereunder, except and solely to the extent the
Indemnifying Party is actually prejudiced by such failure. If the Indemnified
Party is seeking indemnification with respect to any claim or action brought
against the Indemnified Party, then the Indemnifying Party shall be entitled
to participate in such claim or action, and, to the extent that it wishes,
jointly with all other Indemnifying Parties, to assume control of the defense
thereof with counsel satisfactory to the Indemnified Party. After notice from
the Indemnifying Party to the Indemnified Party of its election to assume
control of the defense of such claim or action, the Indemnifying Party shall
not be liable to the Indemnified Party for any legal or other expenses
subsequently incurred by the Indemnified Party in connection with the defense
thereof other than reasonable costs of investigation; provided, however, that
in any action in which both the Indemnified Party and the Indemnifying Party
are named as defendants, the Indemnified Party shall have the right to employ
separate counsel (but no more than one such separate counsel) to represent the
Indemnified Party and its controlling persons who may be subject to liability
arising out of any claim in respect of which indemnity may be sought by the
Indemnified Party against the Indemnifying Party, with the fees and expenses
of such counsel to be paid by such Indemnifying Party if, based upon the
written advice of counsel of such Indemnified Party, representation of both
parties by the same counsel would be inappropriate due to actual or potential
differing interests between them. No Indemnifying Party shall, without the
prior written consent of the Indemnified Party, consent to entry of judgment
or effect any settlement of any claim or pending or threatened proceeding in
respect of which the Indemnified Party is or could have been a party and
indemnity could have been sought hereunder by such Indemnified Party, unless
such judgment or settlement includes an unconditional release of such
Indemnified Party from all liability arising out of such claim or proceeding.

  



    

104

 



    



  

4.4. _Contribution_.

  



  

4.4.1. If the indemnification provided for in the foregoing Sections 4.1, 4.2
and 4.3 is unavailable to any Indemnified Party in respect of any loss, claim,
damage, liability or action referred to herein, then each such Indemnifying
Party, in lieu of indemnifying such Indemnified Party, shall contribute to
the amount paid or payable by such Indemnified Party as a result of such loss,
claim, damage, liability or action in such proportion as is appropriate to
reflect the relative fault of the Indemnified Parties and the Indemnifying
Parties in connection with the actions or omissions which resulted in such
loss, claim, damage, liability or action, as well as any other relevant
equitable considerations. The relative fault of any Indemnified Party and any
Indemnifying Party shall be determined by reference to, among other
things, whether the untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or
the omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to
information supplied by such Indemnified Party or such Indemnifying Party and
the parties' relative intent, knowledge, access to information and
opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission.

  



  

4.4.2. The parties hereto agree that it would not be just and equitable if
contribution pursuant to this Section 4.4 were determined by pro rata
allocation or by any other method of allocation which does not take account
of the equitable considerations referred to in the immediately preceding
Section 4.4.1.

  



  

4.4.3. The amount paid or payable by an Indemnified Party as a result of any
loss, claim, damage, liability or action referred to in the immediately
preceding paragraph shall be deemed to include, subject to the limitations
set forth above, any legal or other expenses incurred by such Indemnified
Party in connection with investigating or defending any such action or claim.
Notwithstanding the provisions of this Section 4.4, no holder of
Registrable Securities shall be required to contribute any amount in excess
of the dollar amount of the net proceeds (after payment of any underwriting
fees, discounts, commissions or taxes) actually received by such holder from
the sale of Registrable Securities which gave rise to such contribution
obligation. No person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the
meaning of Section 11(f) of the Securities Act) with respect to any action
shall be entitled to contribution in such action from any person who was
not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation.

  



    

105

 



    



  

5\. _RULE 144_. The Company covenants that it shall file any reports required
to be filed by it under the Securities Act and the Exchange Act and shall take
such further action as the holders of Registrable Securities may reasonably
request, all to the extent required from time to time to enable such holders
to sell Registrable Securities without registration under the Securities Act
within the limitation of the exemptions provided by Rule 144 under the
Securities Act, as such Rules may be amended from time to time, or any similar
rule or regulation hereafter adopted by the Commission.

  



  

6\. _MISCELLANEOUS_.

  



  

6.1. _Other Registration Rights_. The Company represents and warrants that no
person other than the holders of the Registrable Securities has any right to
require the Company to register any shares of the Company's capital stock for
sale or to include shares of the Company's capital stock in any registration
filed by the Company for the sale of shares of capital stock for its own
account or for the account of any other person.

  



  

6.2. _Assignment; No Third Party Beneficiaries_. This Agreement and the
rights, duties and obligations of the Company hereunder may not be assigned or
delegated by the Company in whole or in part. This Agreement and the rights,
duties and obligations of the holders of Registrable Securities hereunder
may be freely assigned or delegated by such holder of Registrable Securities
in conjunction with and to the extent of any transfer of Registrable
Securities by any such holder; provided, that the transferee of such
Registrable Securities shall execute and deliver a joinder to this Agreement
in the form attached hereto as Exhibit A. This Agreement and the provisions
hereof shall be binding upon and shall inure to the benefit of each of the
parties and to the permitted assigns of the Investors who hereafter become
party to this Agreement by executing and delivering a joinder. This Agreement
is not intended to confer any rights or benefits on any persons that are not
party hereto, other than as expressly set forth in Article 4 and this Section
6.2.

  



  

6.3. _Notices_. All notices, demands, requests, consents, approvals or other
communications (collectively, " _Notices_ ") required or permitted to be
given hereunder or which are given with respect to this Agreement shall be in
writing and shall be personally served, delivered by reputable air courier
service with charges prepaid, or transmitted by hand delivery or email,
addressed as set forth below, or to such other address as such party shall
have specified most recently by written notice. Notice shall be deemed given
on the date of service or transmission if personally served or transmitted by
email; provided, that if such service or transmission is not on a business
day or is after normal business hours, then such notice shall be deemed given
on the next business day. Notice otherwise sent as provided herein shall be
deemed given on the next business day following timely delivery of such notice
to a reputable air courier service with an order for next-day delivery.
