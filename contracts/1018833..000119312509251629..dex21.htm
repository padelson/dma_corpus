1.2 _Closing_. The closing of the Merger (the " _Closing_ ") shall take place
at the offices of Shearman and Sterling LLP, 525 Market Street, 15th Floor, San

conditions), or at such other place, date and time as Company and Parent may
agree in writing.

1.3 _Effective Time_. On the Closing Date, immediately after the Closing, the
parties hereto shall cause the Merger to be consummated by filing a
certificate of merger (the " _Certificate of Merger_ ") with the Secretary of
State of the State of Delaware and make all other filings or recordings
required under the DGCL in connection with the Merger. The Merger shall become
effective at such time as the Certificate of Merger is duly filed with the
Secretary of State of the State of Delaware, or at such later time as Parent
and Company shall agree and shall specify in the Certificate of Merger (the
time the Merger becomes effective being the " _Effective Time_ ").

1.4 _Effects of the Merger; Further Action_. The effects of the Merger shall
be as provided in this Agreement and in the applicable provisions of the
DGCL. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, at the Effective Time,
all the property, rights, privileges, powers and franchises of Company and
Merger Sub shall vest in the Surviving Corporation, and all debts,
liabilities and duties of Company and Merger Sub shall become the debts,
liabilities and duties of the Surviving Corporation, all as provided under the
applicable Laws of the State of Delaware. If at any time after the Effective
Time any further action is necessary to vest in the Surviving Corporation the
title to all property or rights of Merger Sub or Company, the authorized
officers and directors of the Surviving Corporation are fully authorized in
the name of Merger Sub or Company, as the case may be, to take, and shall
take, any and all such lawful action.

1.5 _Certificate of Incorporation of the Surviving Corporation_. Subject to
Section 5.9 of this Agreement, at the Effective Time, the Fourth Amended and
Restated Certificate of Incorporation of Company, as in effect immediately
prior to the Effective Time, shall be the certificate of incorporation of the
Surviving Corporation until thereafter amended as provided therein or in
accordance with applicable Law.

1.6 _By-laws of the Surviving Corporation_. Subject to Section 5.9 of this
Agreement, at the Effective Time, the by-laws of Merger Sub, as in effect
immediately prior to the Effective Time, shall be the by-laws of the
Surviving Corporation until thereafter amended as provided therein, in the
certificate of incorporation or in accordance with applicable Law.

1.7 _Directors_. The Directors of Merger Sub immediately prior to the
Effective Time shall, from and after the Effective Time, be the directors of
the Surviving Corporation until their successors have been duly elected or
appointed and qualified or until their earlier death, resignation or removal
in accordance with the certificate of incorporation and the by-laws.

  

 

2 1.8 _Officers_. The officers of Merger Sub immediately prior to the Effective
Time shall, from and after the Effective Time, be the officers of the
Surviving Corporation until their successors have been duly elected or
appointed and qualified or until their earlier death, resignation or removal
in accordance with the certificate of incorporation and the by-laws.

_ARTICLE II_

_EFFECT OF THE MERGER ON CAPITAL STOCK; EXCHANGE OF CERTIFICATES_

2.1 _Effect on Capital Stock_. At the Effective Time, as a result of the
Merger and without any further action on the part of Company, Parent, Merger
Sub or any holder of any shares of capital stock of Company, Parent or Merger
Sub:

(a) _Merger Sub_. Each share of common stock, par value of $0.001 per share,
of Merger Sub issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time
shall be converted into and become one (1) validly issued, fully paid and
nonassessable share of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of the
Surviving Corporation and constitute the only outstanding shares of capital
stock of the Surviving Corporation. From and after the Effective Time, all
certificates representing the common stock of Merger Sub shall be deemed for
all purposes to represent the number of shares of common stock of the
Surviving Corporation into which they were converted in accordance with the
immediately preceding sentence.

(b) _Cancellation of Treasury Stock and Parent-Owned Stock_. Each Share or
Preferred Share that is owned directly or indirectly by Company as treasury
stock or by Parent, Merger Sub or any other Subsidiary (as defined in Section
3.1(a)) of Parent or Company immediately prior to the Effective Time (the "
_Cancelled Shares_ ") shall, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on
the part of the holder thereof, automatically be cancelled and shall cease to
exist, and no cash or other consideration shall be delivered in exchange
therefor.

(c) _Conversion of Company Capital Stock_.

(i) Subject to Section 2.1(b) and Section 2.3(a), each share of common stock,
par value $0.01 per share, of Company issued and outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective Time (such shares collectively, " _Common Shares_ " or
" _Shares_ " and each, a " _Common Share_ " or " _Share_ "), including any
Common Shares issued upon the conversion of any Preferred Shares (as defined
in Section 2.1(c)(ii)) into Common Shares by the holder thereof prior to the
Effective Time, in each case other than any Cancelled Shares (to the extent
provided in Section 2.1(b)) and any Dissenting Common Shares (as defined, and
to the extent provided in Section 2.3(a)), shall be cancelled and shall be
converted automatically into the right to receive from the Surviving
Corporation $8.50 per Common Share in cash, without interest (the " _Merger
Consideration_ ") payable to the holder thereof upon surrender in the manner
provided in Section 2.2(b) of the certificate or certificates (a "
_Certificate_ "), or of Common Shares not represented by certificates (" _Book
Entry Shares_ "), which in each case immediately prior to the Effective Time
evidenced such Shares.

(ii) Subject to Section 2.1(b) and 2.3(a), each share of Series A Cumulative
Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock (liquidation preference $25.00 per
share), par value $0.01 per share, of Company issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time (such shares collectively, "
_Preferred Shares_ " and each, a " _Preferred Share_ "), to the extent not
converted by the holder thereof into Shares prior to the Effective Time, other
than any Cancelled Shares (to the extent provided in Section 2.1(b)) and any
Dissenting Preferred Shares (as defined, and to the extent provided in
Section 2.3(a)), shall be cancelled and shall be converted automatically into
the 



 

3  right to receive from the Surviving Corporation $13.7097 per Preferred Share
in cash, without interest (the " _Preferred Merger Consideration_ ") payable
to the holder thereof upon surrender in the manner provided in Section 2.2(b)
of the certificate or certificates (a " _Preferred Certificate_ ") which
immediately prior to the Effective Time evidenced such Preferred Shares.

(d) _Stock Options; ESPP_. Prior to the Effective Time, Company shall take, or
shall cause to be taken, all actions necessary, including, without
limitation, the amendment of the Company Stock Plans (as defined in Section
3.1(b)) effective as of the Effective Time described in Section 2.1(d) of the
Company Disclosure Schedules (as defined in Section 3.1), to terminate (to
the extent applicable), effective as of the Effective Time, the Company Stock
Plans as to future grants and to cause each option to purchase Common Shares
(each, a " _Company Option_ ") outstanding immediately prior to the Effective
Time, whether vested or unvested, to be canceled at the Effective Time and to
thereafter represent the right to receive, at the Effective Time or as soon as
practicable thereafter, but in no event later than March 15, 2011, in
full satisfaction of the rights of the holder with respect thereto, an amount
in cash equal to (i) the product of (A) the number of Common Shares subject to
such Company Option immediately prior to the Effective Time, multiplied by (B)
the amount, if any, by which the Merger Consideration exceeds the exercise
price per share of Company Shares previously subject to such Company Option,
less (ii) such amounts as may be required to be withheld or deducted under the
Code or any provision of any other applicable Tax Law with respect to the
making of such payment. Immediately following the Effective Time, Parent shall
assume the Company Stock Plans and any rights, obligations and liabilities
(contingent or otherwise) of Company thereunder, with such assumption being
effective as of the Effective Time, and the Parent Board of Directors or a
committee thereof shall succeed to the authority and responsibility of the
Company Board of Directors or any committee thereof with respect to the
Company Stock Plans. In accordance with the terms of Companys 2008 Employee
Stock Purchase Plan (the " _ESPP_ "), immediately prior to the Effective Time,
the then-current "Purchase Interval" (as such term is defined in the ESPP),
if any, shall terminate and each participants payroll deductions for such
Purchase Interval shall be applied to the purchase of Common Shares at the
applicable purchase price and in accordance with the terms of the ESPP.

2.2 _Exchange of Share Certificates_.

(a) _Paying Agent_. Prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall designate a bank
or trust company to act as paying agent (the " _Paying Agent_ ") for the
payment of the Merger Consideration and Preferred Merger Consideration. At or
as soon as reasonably practicable following the Effective Time, Parent shall
deposit, or cause the Surviving Corporation to deposit, with the Paying
Agent, for the benefit of the holders of Certificates and Book Entry Shares,
an amount equal to the aggregate Merger Consideration, and for the benefit of
the holders of Preferred Certificates, an amount equal to the aggregate
Preferred Merger Consideration. The deposit made by Parent or Merger Sub, as
the case may be, pursuant to this Section 2.2(a) is hereinafter referred to as
the " _Exchange Fund_." Such funds shall be invested in Permitted Investments
by the Paying Agent as directed by the Surviving Corporation. Any interest or
other income resulting from such investment shall be paid to and be income of
Parent. The Exchange Fund shall not be used for any purpose that is
not expressly provided for in this Agreement. " _Permitted Investments_ "
shall mean (a) direct obligations of the United States, (b) obligations for
which the full faith and credit of the United States is pledged to provide
for the payment of principal and interest and (c) certificates of deposit or
demand deposits of a commercial bank having at least $1 billion in assets and
rated in one of two highest rating categories (without regard to refinements
within such rating categories) by Moodys Investors Services, Inc. or
Standard and Poors Ratings Group.



 

4 (b) _Exchange Procedures_.

(i) Promptly after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall cause
the Paying Agent to mail to each holder of record of a Certificate or Book
Entry Share (i) a letter of transmittal specifying that delivery of the
Certificates or Book Entry Shares shall be effected, and risk of loss and
title to the Certificates or Book Entry Shares, as applicable, shall pass,
only upon proper delivery of the Certificates (or affidavits of loss
reasonably satisfactory to the Surviving Corporation in lieu thereof) or Book
Entry Shares to the Paying Agent, such letter of transmittal to be in
customary form and have such other provisions as Parent may reasonably
specify, and (ii) instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the
Certificates or Book Entry Shares, as applicable, in exchange for the Merger
Consideration (such instructions shall include instructions for the payment
of the Merger Consideration to a Person other than the Person in whose name
the surrendered Certificate or Book Entry Share is registered on the transfer
books of Company, subject to the receipt of appropriate documentation for
such transfer). Upon surrender to the Paying Agent of a Certificate (or
evidence reasonably satisfactory to the Surviving Corporation of loss in lieu
thereof) or Book Entry Shares, as applicable, for cancellation together with
such letter of transmittal, duly completed and validly executed, and such
other documents as may reasonably be requested by the Paying Agent, the holder
of such Certificate or Book Entry Share shall be entitled to receive in
exchange therefor the Merger Consideration that such holder is entitled to
receive pursuant to this Article II, and the Certificate or Book Entry Share
so surrendered shall forthwith be cancelled; _provided_ , that in no event
will a holder of a Certificate or Book Entry Share be entitled to receive the
Merger Consideration if Merger Consideration was already paid with respect to
the Shares underlying such Certificate in connection with an affidavit of
loss. No interest will be paid or accrued on any amount payable upon due
surrender of the Certificates or Book Entry Shares. In the event of a transfer
of ownership of Common Shares that is not registered in the transfer records
of Company, payment may be issued to such a transferee if the Certificate or
Book Entry Share formerly representing such Common Shares is presented to the
Paying Agent, accompanied by all documents reasonably satisfactory to the
Surviving Corporation required to evidence and effect such transfer, and the
Person requesting such issuance pays any transfer or other taxes required by
reason of such payment to a Person other than the registered holder of such
Certificate or Book Entry Share or establishes to the satisfaction of Parent
and Company that such tax has been paid or is not applicable. All cash paid
upon the surrender of a Certificate or Book Entry Share in accordance with the
terms of this Section 2.2 shall be deemed to have been paid in full
satisfaction of all rights pertaining to the Common Shares formerly
represented by such Certificate or Book Entry Share.

(ii) Promptly after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall cause
the Paying Agent to mail to each holder of record of a Preferred Certificate
(i) a letter of transmittal specifying that delivery of the Preferred
Certificates shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the Preferred
Certificates shall pass, only upon proper delivery of the Preferred
Certificates (or affidavits of loss reasonably satisfactory to the Surviving
Corporation in lieu thereof) to the Paying Agent, such letter of transmittal
to be in customary form and have such other provisions as Parent may
reasonably specify, and (ii) instructions for use in effecting the surrender
of the Preferred Certificates in exchange for the Preferred Merger
Consideration (such instructions shall include instructions for the payment
of the Preferred Merger Consideration to a Person other than the Person in
whose name the surrendered Preferred Certificate is registered on the transfer
books of Company, subject to the receipt of appropriate documentation for
such transfer). Upon surrender to the Paying Agent of a Preferred Certificate
(or evidence reasonably satisfactory to the Surviving Corporation of loss in
lieu thereof) for cancellation together with such letter of transmittal, duly
completed and validly executed, and such other documents as may reasonably be
requested by the Paying Agent, the holder of such Preferred Certificate shall
be entitled to receive in exchange therefor the Preferred Merger Consideration
that such holder is entitled to receive pursuant to this Article II, and the
Preferred Certificate so surrendered shall forthwith be 



 

5  cancelled; _provided_ , that in no event will a holder of a Preferred
Certificate be entitled to receive the Preferred Merger Consideration if
Preferred Merger Consideration was already paid with respect to the Preferred
Shares underlying such Preferred Certificate in connection with an affidavit
of loss. No interest will be paid or accrued on any amount payable upon due
surrender of the Preferred Certificates. In the event of a transfer of
ownership of Preferred Shares that is not registered in the transfer records
of Company, payment may be issued to such a transferee if the Preferred
Certificate formerly representing such Preferred Shares is presented to the
Paying Agent, accompanied by all documents reasonably satisfactory to the
Surviving Corporation required to evidence and effect such transfer, and the
Person requesting such issuance pays any transfer or other taxes required by
reason of such payment to a Person other than the registered holder of such
Preferred Certificate or establishes to the satisfaction of Parent and Company
that such tax has been paid or is not applicable. All cash paid upon the
surrender of a Preferred Certificate in accordance with the terms of this
Section 2.2 shall be deemed to have been paid in full satisfaction of all
rights pertaining to the Preferred Shares formerly represented by such
Preferred Certificate.

(iii) For the purposes of this Agreement, the term " _Person_ " shall mean any
individual, corporation (including not-for-profit corporations), general or
limited partnership, limited liability company, joint venture, estate, trust,
association, organization, Governmental Entity (as defined in Section
3.1(d)(i)) or other entity of any kind or nature.

(c) _Transfers_. At the close of business on the day of the Effective Time,
the stock transfer books of Company shall be closed and thereafter there
shall be no further registration of transfers on the stock transfer books of
Company of Common Shares or Preferred Shares that were outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective Time. From and after the Effective Time, the holders
of Common Shares or Preferred Shares outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time shall cease to have any rights with respect to such Common
Shares or Preferred Shares except as otherwise provided herein or
by applicable Law.

(d) _Termination of Exchange Fund_. Any portion of the Exchange Fund relating
to the Merger Consideration or Preferred Merger Consideration that remains
unclaimed by the stockholders of Company one hundred and eighty (180) days
after the Effective Time shall be returned to Parent or the Surviving
Corporation. Any stockholders of Company who have not theretofore complied
with this Article II shall thereafter look only to the Surviving Corporation
for payment of the Merger Consideration or Preferred Merger Consideration, as
applicable, upon due surrender of their Certificates, Book Entry Shares or
Preferred Certificates (or affidavits of loss reasonably satisfactory to the
Surviving Corporation in lieu thereof), without any interest thereon.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, none of Parent, Merger Sub, the Surviving
Corporation, the Paying Agent or any other Person shall be liable to any
former holder of Common Shares or Preferred Shares or for any amount properly
delivered to a public official pursuant to applicable abandoned property,
escheat or similar Laws. If any Certificate, Book Entry Share or Preferred
Certificate has not been surrendered prior to five years after the Effective
Time (or immediately prior to such earlier date on which Merger Consideration
in respect of such Certificate or Book Entry Share, or Preferred Merger
Consideration in respect of such Preferred Certificate, as applicable, would
otherwise escheat to or become the property of any Governmental Entity) any
such Shares or Preferred Shares, cash, dividends or distributions in respect
of such Certificate, Book Entry Share or Preferred Certificate shall, to the
extent permitted by applicable Law, become the property of the Surviving
Corporation, free and clear of all claims or interest of any
Person previously entitled thereto.

(e) _Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates_. In the event that any
Certificate or Preferred Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or
destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the Person claiming
such Certificate or Preferred Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and,
if required by 



 

6  Parent, the posting by such Person of a bond reasonably satisfactory to the
Surviving Corporation as indemnity against any claim that may be made against
it with respect to such Certificate or Preferred Certificate, the Paying
Agent will issue in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate
the Merger Consideration upon due surrender of the Common Shares represented
by such Certificate pursuant to this Agreement, and the Paying Agent will
issue in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Preferred Certificate the
Preferred Merger Consideration upon due surrender of the Preferred Shares
represented by such Preferred Certificate pursuant to this Agreement.

(f) _Withholding Rights_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein,
each of Parent, Merger Sub, the Paying Agent and the Surviving Corporation
shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the consideration otherwise
payable to any Person pursuant to this Article II such amounts as it is
required to deduct and withhold with respect to the making of such payment
under provision of any federal, state, local or foreign Tax Law or under the
Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the " _Code_ "), and the rules and
regulations promulgated thereunder; _provided, however_ , that any holder of
Common Shares or Preferred Shares with respect to which such deduction or
withholding will be done shall be permitted to provide, in accordance with the
customary practices and procedures of the Paying Agent, any properly completed
forms or certificates which may reduce the amount of Tax that is required to
be so deducted or withheld. If Parent, Merger Sub, the Paying Agent or the
Surviving Corporation, as the case may be, so withholds amounts, such amounts
shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to
the holder of the Common Shares or Preferred Shares in respect of which
Parent, Merger Sub, the Paying Agent or the Surviving Corporation, as the case
may be, made such deduction and withholding.

2.3 _Dissenters  Rights_.

(a) Notwithstanding anything in any other Section of this Agreement to the
contrary, (a) Common Shares outstanding immediately prior to the Effective
Time and held by a holder who has not voted in favor of the Merger or
consented thereto in writing and who has demanded properly in writing
appraisal for such Common Shares in accordance with Section 262 of the DGCL
(collectively, the " _Dissenting Common Shares_ ") shall not be converted
into, or represent the right to receive, the Merger Consideration, unless such
holder fails to perfect or withdraws or otherwise loses his right to
appraisal, and (b) Preferred Shares outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time and held by a holder who has not voted in favor of the Merger
or consented thereto in writing and who has demanded properly in writing
appraisal for such Preferred Shares in accordance with Section 262 of the DGCL
(collectively, the " _Dissenting Preferred Shares_ " and, together with the
Dissenting Common Shares, the " _Dissenting Shares_ ") shall not be converted
into, or represent the right to receive, the Preferred Merger Consideration,
unless such holder fails to perfect or withdraws or otherwise loses his right
to appraisal. At the Effective Time, all Dissenting Shares shall no longer be
outstanding and shall automatically be cancelled and shall cease to exist, and
each holder of Dissenting Shares shall cease to have any rights with respect
thereto, except the right to receive, subject to and net of any applicable
withholding of Taxes, payment of the appraised value of such Dissenting Shares
held by them in accordance with the provisions of Section 262 of the DGCL.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, if any such holder shall fail to perfect or
otherwise shall waive, withdraw or lose the right to appraisal under Section
262 of the DGCL or a court of competent jurisdiction shall determine that
such holder is not entitled to the relief provided by Section 262 of the DGCL,
then the right of such holder to receive, subject to and net of any applicable
withholding of Taxes, payment of the appraised value of such Dissenting
Shares held by them in accordance with the provisions of Section 262 of the
DGCL shall cease and such Dissenting Shares, (x) if Dissenting Common Shares,
shall thereupon be deemed to have been converted into, and to have become
exchangeable for, as of the Effective Time, the right to receive the Merger
Consideration, without any interest thereon, upon surrender, in the manner
provided in Section 2.2, of the Certificate(s) or Book Entry Share(s) that
formerly evidenced such Dissenting Common Shares, and (y) if Dissenting
Preferred Shares, shall 



 

7  thereupon be deemed to have been converted into, and to have become
exchangeable for, as of the Effective Time, the right to receive the Preferred
Merger Consideration, without any interest thereon, upon surrender, in the
manner provided in Section 2.2, of the Preferred Certificate(s) that formerly
evidenced such Dissenting Preferred Shares.

(b) Company shall give Parent prompt notice of any demands for appraisal
received by Company, withdrawals of such demands and any other instruments
served on or otherwise received by Company pursuant to the DGCL, and Parent
shall have the right to direct all negotiations and proceedings with respect
to demands for appraisal under DGCL. Company shall not, except with the prior
written consent of Parent, make any payment with respect to any demands for
appraisal or offer to settle or settle any such demands.

2.4 _Adjustments to Prevent Dilution_. In the event that Company changes the
number of Common Shares or Preferred Shares or securities convertible or
exchangeable into or exercisable for Common Shares or Preferred Shares issued
and outstanding prior to the Effective Time as a result of a
reclassification, stock split (including a reverse stock split), stock
dividend or distribution, recapitalization, merger, subdivision, issuer tender
or exchange offer, or other similar transaction, the Merger Consideration and
Preferred Merger Consideration shall be equitably adjusted to reflect such
change.

_ARTICLE III _

_REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES_

3.1  _Representations and Warranties of Company_. Except as specifically set
forth in the disclosure schedules delivered to Parent by Company on or prior
to the date of this Agreement (the " _Company Disclosure Schedules_ "),
Company hereby represents and warrants to Parent and Merger Sub that:

(a) _Organization, Good Standing and Qualification_. Each of Company and its
Subsidiaries is a corporation duly organized, validly existing and in good
standing under the Laws of its respective jurisdiction of organization and has
all requisite corporate or similar power and authority to own and operate its
properties and assets and to carry on its business as currently conducted and
is qualified to do business and is in good standing as a foreign corporation
in each jurisdiction where the ownership or operation of its properties and
assets or conduct of its business requires such qualification, except where
the failure to be so qualified as a foreign corporation or be in good standing
would not be reasonably likely to, either individually or in the aggregate,
have a Company Material Adverse Effect (as defined herein). Company has
heretofore made available to Parent complete and correct copies of Companys
and each of its Subsidiaries certificate of incorporation and by-laws (or
comparable governing instruments), as amended. The certificate of
incorporation and by-laws (or comparable governing instruments) of each of
Company and its Subsidiaries so made available are in full force and effect.
Section 3.1(a) of the Company Disclosure Schedules sets forth a list of all
of the Subsidiaries of Company, the jurisdictions under which such
Subsidiaries are incorporated, and the percent of the equity interest therein
owned by Company and each other Subsidiary of Company, as applicable. Except

interest convertible into or exchangeable or exercisable for any equity or
similar interest in, any corporation, partnership, joint venture or other
business association or entity.

As used in this Agreement, the term " _Subsidiary_ " means, with respect to
Company, Parent or Merger Sub, as the case may be, any entity, whether
incorporated or unincorporated, of which at least a 



 

8  majority of the securities or ownership interests having by their terms

Persons performing similar functions is directly or indirectly owned or
controlled by such party or by one or more of its respective Subsidiaries or
by such party and any one or more of its respective Subsidiaries.

As used in this Agreement, the term " _Affiliate_ " shall mean, with respect
to any Person, any other Person directly or indirectly controlling,
controlled by, or under common control with, such Person; _provided_ , that,
for the purposes of this definition, "control" (including, with correlative
meanings, the terms "controlled by" and "under common control with"), as used
with respect to any Person, shall mean the possession, directly or indirectly,
of the power to direct or cause the direction of the management and policies
of such Person, whether through the ownership of voting securities, by
contract or otherwise.

As used in this Agreement, the term " _Company Material Adverse Effect_ "
means, any event, circumstance, occurrence, state of facts, change or effect
that, individually or in the aggregate with any other events, circumstances,
occurrences, states of facts, changes and effects, is or is reasonably
likely to be materially adverse to (a) the business, condition (financial or
otherwise), assets (tangible or intangible), liabilities (including contingent
liabilities) or results of operations of Company and its Subsidiaries taken as
a whole or (b) the ability of Company to consummate the Merger and the other
transactions contemplated hereby; _provided, however_ , that any such event,
circumstance, occurrence, state of facts, change or effect resulting from or
arising out of (i) changes in general economic or business conditions,
including changes in the U.S. securities markets, (ii) conditions generally
affecting the industry in which Company operates, (iii) acts of war (whether
declared or undeclared), sabotage, terrorism, military action or any
escalation or worsening thereof, (iv) any cancellation of or delays in
customer orders or work for clients, any reductions in sales, or any
disruption in licensor, vendor, partner or similar relationships or any loss
of employees, which Company can demonstrate in each case is primarily and
directly attributable to the execution of this Agreement, the announcement of
this Agreement or the pendency or consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby, (v) changes in United States generally
accepted accounting principles (" _U.S. GAAP_ ") or changes in the
interpretation of U.S. GAAP, or changes in the accounting rules and
regulations of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the " _SEC_ "),
(vi) any other action taken at the written request of Parent or Merger Sub,
(vii) any demand for appraisal under Section 262 of the DGCL made by holders
of Preferred Shares or Common Shares and any litigation brought or threatened
by holders of Preferred Shares or Common Shares to the extent asserting
allegations of breach of fiduciary duty relating to the approval of this
Agreement by the Board of Directors of Company or the Special Committee or
violations of securities Laws in connection with the Proxy Statement (as
defined herein), (viii) any changes in Law, or (ix) a decline in the trading
price or trading volume of Common Shares and any failure in and of itself by
Company to meet analysts published revenue or earnings predictions or any
internal or disseminated projections, forecasts or revenue or earnings
predictions for any period ending (or for which revenues or earnings are
released) on or after the date of this Agreement ( _provided_ that, the
underlying causes of any such decline or failure may be considered in
determining whether there has been a Company Material Effect), shall not be
considered when determining if a Company Material Adverse Effect has
occurred; except that, with respect to clauses (i), (ii), (iii), (v) or
(viii), in the event any such event, circumstance, occurrence, state of facts,
change or effect has had a disproportionate effect on Company and its
Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, compared to other Persons engaged in the
industry in which Company operates, such event, circumstance, occurrence,
state of facts, change or effect shall be considered in determining whether a
Company Material Adverse Effect has occurred.

As used in this Agreement, the term " _knowledge_ " or any similar formulation
of knowledge shall mean the actual knowledge after reasonable investigation
of, with respect to Company, those individuals set forth in Section 3.1(a) of
the Company Disclosure Schedules and, with respect to Parent, those

Schedules (as defined in Section 3.2).

financial statements included in or incorporated by reference into the Company
Reports filed after the date hereof will comply, in all material respects with
the applicable rules and regulations of the SEC with respect thereto. Each of
the consolidated balance sheets included in or incorporated by reference into
the Company Reports (including the related notes and schedules) presents, and
in the case of consolidated balance sheets included in or incorporated by
reference into Company Reports filed after the date hereof will present fairly
in all material respects, the financial position of Company and its
Subsidiaries as of its date, and each of the consolidated statements of
income and consolidated statements of cash flows included in or incorporated
by reference into the Company Reports (including any related notes and
schedules) presents, and in the case of consolidated statements of income
and consolidated statements of cash flows included in or incorporated by
reference into Company Reports filed after the date hereof will present,
fairly the results of operations, retained earnings and changes in financial
position, as the case may be, of Company and its Subsidiaries for the periods
set forth therein (subject, in the case of unaudited statements, to the
absence of notes and normal year-end audit adjustments), in each case in
accordance with U.S. GAAP consistently applied during the periods involved,
except as may be noted therein.

potentially involved in a Securities Investors Protection Act action
or claim) (collectively, " _Marketable Securities_ ") totaling $10.3 million,
and (z) Working Capital totaling $(27.4) million. " _Working Capital_ " means
(x) Companys current assets (as such term is defined under U.S. GAAP),
excluding Cash and Marketable Securities, minus (y) Companys current
liabilities (as such term is defined under U.S. GAAP), excluding current
liabilities with respect to all fees and expenses incurred by Company
in connection with this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby.
Current assets and current liabilities shall be calculated consistently with
the presentation of these items in the most recent Company Reports.

(iii) Company has heretofore furnished to Parent complete and correct copies

the SEC to all 



 

13  agreements, documents and other instruments that previously had been filed
by Company with the SEC and are currently in effect.

(iv) Company maintains and shall continue to maintain a standard system of
accounting established and administered in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Company

of, and all policies, manuals and other documents promulgating, such
internal accounting controls.

Companys disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Sections 13a-15(e)
and 15d-15(e) of the Exchange Act) effectively enable Company to comply with,
and the appropriate officers of Company to make all certifications
required under, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and the regulations promulgated
thereunder. Section 3.1(e)(v) of the Company Disclosure Schedules lists, and
Company has made available to Parent, complete and correct copies of, all
written descriptions of, and all policies, manuals and other documents
promulgating, such disclosure controls and procedures. As used in this Section
3.1(e), the term "file" shall be broadly construed to include any manner in
which a document or information is furnished, supplied or otherwise made
available to the SEC.

(f) _Disclosure Documents_. None of the information provided or to be
provided by Company or its Subsidiaries to be included or incorporated by
reference in (i) the Proxy Statement (as defined below) or (ii) any other
document to be filed with the SEC or any other Governmental Entity in
connection with the Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby
(the " _Other Filings_ ") will, at the respective times filed with the SEC or
other Governmental Entity and, in addition, in the case of the Proxy
Statement, at the date it or any amendment or supplement is mailed to
stockholders, and at the Effective Time, contain any untrue statement of a
material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein
or necessary in order to make the statements made therein, in light of the
circumstances under which they were made, not misleading. The Proxy Statement

Exchange Act and the rules and regulations thereunder, except that
no representation is made by Company with respect to statements made therein
based on information supplied by Parent or Merger Sub in writing specifically
for inclusion in the Proxy Statement. The letters to stockholders, notices of
meeting, proxy statement and forms of proxies to be distributed to
stockholders in connection with the Merger are collectively referred to herein
as the " _Proxy Statement_."

(g) _No Undisclosed Liabilities_. There are no liabilities or obligations of
Company or any of its Subsidiaries of any kind whatsoever in existence,
whether accrued, contingent, absolute, determined, determinable or otherwise,
other than: (i) liabilities or obligations disclosed and provided for in the
Company balance sheet as of September 30, 2009 (the " _Company Balance Sheet
Date_ ") included in the Company Reports filed prior to the date hereof (the "
_Company Balance Sheet_ ") or in the notes thereto; (ii) liabilities or
obligations incurred in the ordinary course of business consistent with past
practices since the Company Balance Sheet Date and prior to the date hereof ,
none of which individually (in the case of 



 

14  this clause (ii)) is material to the business, results of operations or
financial condition of Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, or
(iii) incurred after the date hereof and permitted under Section 4.1 hereof.

(h) _Absence of Certain Changes_. Since December 31, 2008 (the " _Audit Date_
"), (i) except as expressly contemplated by this Agreement, Company and its
Subsidiaries have conducted their business only in the ordinary course of such
business consistent with past practice, (ii) there has been no Company
Material Adverse Effect, and (iii) except as expressly contemplated by this
Agreement, none of Company or any of its Subsidiaries has taken any action
that, if taken after the date of this Agreement, would constitute a breach
of any of the covenants set forth in Section 4.1. Since the Audit Date,
except as provided for herein, there has not been any material increase in the
compensation payable or that could become payable by Company or any of its
Subsidiaries to officers or key employees or any material amendment of any of
the Company Compensation and Benefit Plans (as defined in Section 3.1(j))
other than increases or amendments in the ordinary course of business
consistent with past practice. 

(i) _Litigation_. There are no civil, criminal or administrative actions,
suits, claims, hearings, investigations, reviews or proceedings pending or,

Subsidiaries, except for those that (i) do not involve, in any individual
case, a claim for monetary damages in excess of $100,000 (one hundred
thousand dollars), (ii) would not be reasonably likely to materially prohibit
or restrict Company and its Subsidiaries from operating the business as they
have historically, or (iii) would not be reasonably likely,
either individually or in the aggregate, to have a Company Material Adverse
Effect. There is no (A) suit, action or proceeding pending, or, to the
knowledge of Company, threatened, against Company or any of its Subsidiaries
or (B) judgment, decree, injunction, ruling or order of any Governmental
Entity or arbitrator outstanding against Company or any of its Subsidiaries,
in either case that would be reasonably likely to have, individually or in the
aggregate, a material and adverse effect on the ability of Company to perform
its obligations hereunder or to consummate the Merger and the other
transactions contemplated hereby. To the knowledge of Company, no officer or
director of Company or any Subsidiary of Company is a defendant in any
material suit, claim, action, proceeding, arbitration or mediation in
connection with his or her status as an officer or director of Company or any
Subsidiary of Company. Neither Company nor any of its Subsidiaries nor any of
their respective properties or assets is or are subject to any judgments,
orders or decrees, except for those judgments, orders or decrees that would
not be reasonably likely to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Company
Material Adverse Effect. 

(j) _Employee Benefits_. The term " _Company Compensation and Benefit Plan_ "
shall mean any agreement, plan, policy or arrangement (including any
employment agreement) providing for bonus, deferred compensation, pension,
retirement, profit-sharing, thrift, savings, employee stock ownership, stock
bonus, stock purchase, change in control, retention, restricted stock, stock
option, termination, severance, compensation, commission, medical, health or
other compensation or benefit including, without limitation, each "employee
benefit plan" within the meaning of Section 3(3) of the Employee Retirement
Income Security Act of 1974, as amended (" _ERISA_ "), that covers employees
or former employees (" _Employees_ "), individual consultants or directors or
former directors of Company or any of its Subsidiaries; and any trust
agreement or insurance contract forming a part of such Company Compensation
and Benefit Plan. Section 3.1(j) of the Company Disclosure Schedules lists all
material Company Compensation and Benefit Plans of Company and its
Subsidiaries, and any Company Compensation and Benefit Plans containing
"change of control" or similar provisions therein are specifically identified
in Section 3.1(j) of the Company Disclosure Schedules. Company has
made available to Parent a copy of all material Company Compensation and
Benefit Plans, and all summaries and descriptions of such plan or the terms
thereof previously provided to Companys Employees.



 

15 (i) None of the Company Compensation and Benefit Plans is (i) a multiemployer
plan (within the meaning of Section 3(37) or 4001(a)(3) of ERISA) (a "
_Multiemployer Plan_ "), (ii) a single employer pension plan (within the
meaning of Section 4001(a)(15) of ERISA) for which Company or any Subsidiary
could incur liability under Section 4063 or 4064 of ERISA (a " _Multiple
Employer Plan_ "), or (iii) subject to Title IV or Section 302 of ERISA or
Sections 412 or 4971 of the Code. No liability under Title IV of ERISA has
been or is expected to be incurred by Company or any of its Subsidiaries.

(ii) All Company Compensation and Benefit Plans are and have been operated in
all material respects in accordance with their terms and the requirements of
all applicable Laws and, to the extent subject to ERISA and the Code, are in
compliance in all material respects with the applicable provisions of ERISA,
the Code and any other applicable Law. Each Company Compensation and Benefit
Plan that is an "employee pension benefit plan" within the meaning of Section
3(2) of ERISA (a " _Pension Plan_ ") and that is intended to be qualified
under Section 401(a) of the Code has timely received a favorable determination
letter from the U.S. Department of the Treasury, Internal Revenue Service
(the " _IRS_ "), and each trust established in connection with any Plan which
is intended to be exempt from federal income taxation under Section 501(a) of
the Code has received a determination letter from the IRS that it is so
exempt, and, to the knowledge of Company, nothing has occurred, whether by
action or failure to act, that would cause the loss of such qualification or
that would result in material costs to Company or any of its Subsidiaries
under the Internal Revenue Services Employee Plans Compliance Resolution
System. Each Company Compensation and Benefit Plan and each other arrangement
of Company or any of its Subsidiaries that is, or was, subject to Section 409A
of the Code was administered in reasonable, good faith compliance with the
requirements of Section 409A of the Code through December 31, 2008, and all
Company Compensation and Benefit Plans subject to Section 409A of the Code
that provide payment after December 31, 2008 and were in existence on such
date have been amended (if applicable) to comply with the requirements of the
final regulations under Section 409A of the Code. Neither Company nor any of
its Subsidiaries has elected to or is required to defer payment of amounts
from a foreign entity which will be subject to the provisions of Section 457A
of the Code. There is no pending or, to the knowledge of Company, threatened
litigation relating to the Company Compensation and Benefit Plans. Neither
Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has engaged in a transaction with respect
to any Pension Plan that would subject Company or any of its Subsidiaries to a
material tax or penalty imposed by either Section 4975 of the Code or Section
502(i) or Section 406 of ERISA.

(iii) All contributions, premiums or payments required to be made under the
terms of any Company Compensation and Benefit Plan have been timely made or
have been reflected on the most recent consolidated balance sheet filed or
incorporated by reference in Company Reports. Company and each of its
Subsidiaries have performed all obligations required to be performed by them
under, and are not in any respect in default under or in violation of, any
Company Compensation and Benefit Plan, and Company has no knowledge of any
material default or material violation by any other Person under any Company
Compensation and Benefit Plan. No action, suit or claim (excluding claims for
benefits incurred in the ordinary course) has been brought or is pending or,
to the knowledge of the Company, threatened against or with respect to any
Company Compensation and Benefit Plan or the assets or any fiduciary thereof
(in that Persons capacity as a fiduciary of such Benefit Plan). Company has
no knowledge of any audits, inquiries or proceedings pending or threatened by
the IRS, the U.S. Department of Labor (" _DOL_ "), or any other Governmental
Entity with respect to any Compensation and Benefit Plan, including, without
limitation, any investigations or proceedings regarding any material default
or material violation by any other Person under any Company Compensation and
Benefit Plan. Neither any Pension Plan nor any Multiple Employer Plan for
which Company or any Subsidiary 



 

16  has any liability has an "accumulated funding deficiency" within the meaning
of Section 431 and 432 of the Code or Section 305 of ERISA and no entity under
"common control" with Company within the meaning of Section 414 of the Code
(an " _ERISA Affiliate_ ") has an outstanding funding waiver. Neither Company
nor any of its Subsidiaries has provided, or is required to provide, security
to any Pension Plan or to any Multiple Employer Plan pursuant to Section
401(a)(29) of the Code.

(iv) Neither Company nor its Subsidiaries have any obligations for, or
liabilities with respect to, (x) retiree health, disability or life benefits
under any Company Compensation and Benefit Plan, except for benefits required
to be provided under Section 4980B of the Code or any other applicable Law
requiring continuation of health coverage, and (y) the Executive Long Term
Bonus Plan, which was terminated in accordance with its terms as of April 29,
2009.

(v) Except as may otherwise be disclosed in Section 3.1(j), of the Company
Disclosure Schedules, neither the negotiation and execution of this Agreement
nor the consummation of the Merger and the other transactions contemplated
hereby will (either alone or upon the occurrence of any additional or
subsequent events) constitute an event under any Company Compensation and
Benefit Plan or otherwise that will or may result in any payment (whether of
severance pay, compensation or otherwise), acceleration of payment,
forgiveness of indebtedness, vesting, distribution, increase in benefits or
obligation to fund benefits with respect to any employee or former employee
of Company or any of its Subsidiaries. There is no contract, agreement, plan
or arrangement with an employee or former employee of Company or any of its
Subsidiaries to which Company or any of its Subsidiaries is a party as of the
date of this Agreement that, individually or collectively and as a result of
the Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby (whether alone or
upon the occurrence of any additional or subsequent events) or otherwise,
would reasonably be likely to give rise to the payment of any amount that
would not be deductible pursuant to Sections 280G or 162(m) of the Code. No
Company Compensation and Benefits Plan provides for a "gross-up" or similar
payments in respect of any Taxes that may become payable under Section 409A,
457A or Section 4999(a) of the Code.

(vi) In addition to the foregoing, with respect to each Company Compensation
and Benefit Plan that is not subject to United States Law (a " _Non-U.S.
Benefit Plan_ "):

(A) all employer and employee contributions to each Non-U.S. Benefit Plan
required by Law or by the terms of such Non-U.S. Benefit Plan have been made,
or, if applicable, accrued in accordance with normal accounting practices;

(B) the fair market value of the assets of each funded Non-U.S. Benefit Plan,
the liability of each insurer for any Non-U.S. Benefit Plan funded through
insurance or the book reserve established for any Non-U.S. Benefit Plan,
together with any accrued contributions, is sufficient to procure or provide
for the benefits determined on any ongoing basis (actual or contingent)
accrued to the date of this Agreement with respect to all current and former
participants under such Non-U.S. Benefit Plan according to the actuarial
assumptions and valuations most recently used to determine employer
contributions to such Non-U.S. Benefit Plan; and

(C) each Non-U.S. Benefit Plan (x) required to be registered has been
registered and has been maintained in good standing with applicable regulatory
authorities and (y) is now and always has been operated in all material
respects in compliance with all applicable non-United States Laws.



 

17 (k) _Compliance with Laws_. The business of Company and its Subsidiaries is
not being conducted in violation of any United States or non-United States
federal, state or local law, statute, ordinance, code, rule, regulation,
judgment, order, injunction, decree, arbitration award, agency requirement,
license, authorization or permit of any Governmental Entity (individually, "
_Law_ " and collectively, " _Laws_ "), except for violations that would not be
reasonably likely to, either individually or in the aggregate, have a Company
Material Adverse Effect or prevent, or materially impair the ability of
Company to consummate the Merger and the other transactions contemplated
hereby. No investigation or review by any Governmental Entity with respect to
Company or any of its Subsidiaries is pending or, to the knowledge of
Company, threatened, nor has any Governmental Entity indicated in writing an
intention to conduct the same, except for those the outcome of which would not
be reasonably likely to, either individually or in the aggregate, have
a Company Material Adverse Effect or prevent, or materially impair the
ability of Company to consummate the Merger and the transactions contemplated
hereby. Company and each of its Subsidiaries has, or has applied for, all
permits, licenses, franchises, variances, exemptions, orders and other
governmental authorizations, consents and approvals from Governmental Entities
necessary to own, lease and operate its properties or to conduct its business
as currently conducted, except for those the absence of which would not be
reasonably likely to, either individually or in the aggregate, have a Company
Material Adverse Effect.

(l) _Anti-takeover Statutes_. Company and the Board of Directors of Company or
the Special Committee has taken all action necessary to exempt this Agreement,
the Merger, the Voting Agreements and the other transactions contemplated
hereby from the restrictions on business combinations with interested
stockholders set forth in Section 203 of the DGCL. No other state anti-
takeover statute or regulation is applicable to this Agreement, the Merger,
the Voting Agreements or the other transactions contemplated hereby.

(m) _Environmental Matters_.

aggregate, be reasonably likely to cause a Company Material Adverse Effect:

any written environmental claim, notice or request for information during the

approvals required under applicable Environmental Laws or known liability of
Company or any of its Subsidiaries under any applicable Environmental Law.

filed by each of them and all such filed Tax Returns are true, correct and
complete in all material respects; (B) (1) have timely paid all United States

asserted in writing, or within the knowledge of Company are due, with respect
to the incorrect or late filing of any Tax Return required to be filed by or
with respect to any of them on or before the Effective Time; and (C) with
respect to all Tax Returns filed by or with respect to any of them have not
waived any statute of limitations with respect to Taxes or agreed to any

(ii) Neither Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has received written notice
of any claim made by a Governmental Entity in a jurisdiction in which Company

(iv) The Company Balance Sheet reflects an adequate accrual for all material
Taxes payable by Company for taxable periods and portions thereof through the
Company Balance Sheet Date.

of its Subsidiaries has committed an unfair labor practice or any other
violation of Law relating to employee matters, including those related to
wages, hours, immigration and naturalization, collective bargaining,
occupational safety or health standards, employment discrimination, and the
payment and withholding of Taxes and other sums as required by the appropriate
Governmental Entity, nor has there been any labor strike, dispute, walk-out,
work stoppage, slow-down or lockout involving Company or any of its

consulting or independent contractor agreements with such individuals have
been made available to Parent or Parents legal advisor and are set forth on
Section 3.1(o) of the Company Disclosure Schedules.

rights to use, all Intellectual Property that is currently used in its
business, including the businesses of its Subsidiaries (such Intellectual
Property, together with all other Intellectual Property owned by Company or

_Company Intellectual Property Rights_ "). The Company Intellectual Property
Rights includes all of the Intellectual Property currently used in the

3.1(p)(i) of the Company Disclosure Schedules sets forth a schedule of all
Company Intellectual Property Rights registered or filed with any Governmental
Entity.

(ii) (A) The operation of Companys (and its Subsidiaries) business and the
use of Company Intellectual Property Rights by Company or its Subsidiaries
therein does not conflict 



 

20  with, infringe upon, violate or interfere with or constitute an
appropriation of any Intellectual Property of any other Person and there have

of Company or any of its Subsidiaries is in default or breach of any term of
any employment agreement, non-disclosure agreement, or agreement relating to

Intellectual Property Rights. To the knowledge of Company, no employee or
independent contractor of Company is obligated under any agreement,
or subject to any judgment, decree or order of any court or administrative
agency, or any other restriction, that would or may interfere with such
employee or contractor carrying out his or her duties for Company or that
would conflict with the conduct of Companys business. Company is not
utilizing any inventions of any employees of Company made, or any confidential
information (including trade secrets) of any third party to which such
employees were exposed, prior to their employment by Company. To the extent
that any Intellectual Property has been conceived, developed or created for
Company or any of its Subsidiaries by any Person, Company and/or such
Subsidiary, as applicable, have executed written agreements with such
Person with respect thereto transferring to Company and/or such Subsidiary
sufficient rights to use such Intellectual Property.

Agreement (and all associated documentation (" _Company IT Assets_ ") operate
and perform in all material respects in accordance with their documentation
and functional specifications and are adequate for the operation of the
businesses of Company and its Subsidiaries as currently conducted.

(vi) The operation of Company IT Assets by or on behalf of Company and/or its
Subsidiaries, the content thereof, and the use, collection, storage and
dissemination of personal data in connection therewith or otherwise in
connection with Companys business, have not violated, and are not in
violation of any applicable Laws, in any material respect. There is no action
or claim pending, asserted in writing or, to the knowledge of Company,
threatened by or against Company or any of its Subsidiaries alleging
a violation of any Persons privacy, personal or confidentiality rights under
any applicable Laws. With respect to all personal and user data gathered or
accessed in the course of the operation of Companys business, Company and
its Subsidiaries have at all times taken reasonable measures to protect such
personal data against loss and unauthorized access, use, modification,
disclosure or other misuse, and to the knowledge of Company there has been no
unauthorized access to or other misuse or unauthorized disclosure of such

(vii) There is outstanding no written claim against Company or any of its
Subsidiaries by any third party contesting the validity, enforceability or

Company Intellectual Property Rights. Company and/or one of its Subsidiaries
exclusively owns all 



 

21  Company Intellectual Property Rights free and clear of all Liens (other than

Intellectual Property Rights. Each of Company and its Subsidiaries generally
requires its employees, officers, consultants and contractors to execute

made available to Parent or Parents legal advisor, and all current and

obligation to deliver or make available the source code for any Company
Software to any third party other than third party escrow agents in

agreements that contain confidentiality or non-disclosure provisions. No event
has occurred and no circumstance or other condition exists that (with or
without notice or lapse of time) will, or could reasonably be expected to,
result in the release, delivery, license or disclosure (whether by a third
party escrow agent or otherwise) of any source code for any Company Software
to any Person who is not an employee, consultant, or independent contractor
of Company or any of its Subsidiaries.

(x) Section 3.1(p)(x) of the Company Disclosure Schedules (i) identifies all

distributed or is being used by Company or any of its Subsidiaries in
conjunction with any Public Software in a manner that would require that such
Company Software be disclosed or distributed by the Company in source code
form or made available at no charge. " _Public Software_ " means (x) any
software that contains, or is derived in any manner (in whole or in part)
from, any software that is distributed as open source software (e.g., Linux)

(xi) The transactions contemplated by this Agreement will not materially
alter, impair or otherwise affect any rights of Company or any of its
Subsidiaries in any Company Intellectual Property Rights. Neither this
Agreement nor the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, will result in
Company or any of its Subsidiaries being obligated to license any Company
Intellectual Property Rights to a third party, pay any royalties or other
material amounts, or accelerate the payment of any royalties or any other
material amounts, or offer any discounts, to any third party in excess of

licensed to Company on standard terms), setting forth for each such item all
licenses and similar agreements pursuant to which Company or any of its
Subsidiaries holds rights thereto (collectively, the " _Third Party Licenses_
" ). Neither Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has been subjected to an
audit of any kind in connection with any Third Party License in which a
material breach of such license or other agreement has been found by such
third party.

(xiii) All Company Software conforms in all material respects with the
specifications and applicable warranties for such Company Software. Neither
Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has any material liability or obligation

liability or obligation) other than liabilities, obligations or claims for
replacement or repair incurred or made in the ordinary course of business
consistent with past practice.

software licensed by Company from third parties contains any disabling codes

created, undocumented contaminant (a " _Contaminant_ ") that may, or may be
used to, access, modify, delete, damage or disable any third party systems or

Body and has not participated in the development or approval of any standards

in, or who contributed to, the creation or development of any Company
Software or Company Intellectual Property Rights, has to the knowledge of
Company performed services for any Governmental Entity, a university, college,
or other educational institution, or a research center, during a period of
time during which such employee, consultant or independent contractor was also

other authorized representatives, including financing sources and
their authorized representatives (collectively, " _Representatives_ "),
_provided_ that each such Person has executed a confidentiality agreement with

unreasonably interfere with the business or operations of Company; _provided_
that no investigation pursuant to this Section 5.1 shall affect or be deemed
to modify any representation or warranty made by Company, Parent or Merger Sub
in this Agreement. All requests for information made pursuant to this Section

as may be designated by an executive officer. All such information shall be
governed by the terms of the Confidentiality Agreement.

discussions), or otherwise cooperate with or assist or participate in, or
knowingly facilitate any such inquiries, proposals, offers, discussions or
negotiations or (ii) approve or recommend, or publicly propose to approve or
recommend, an Acquisition Proposal, or enter into any merger agreement, letter
of intent, agreement in principle, share purchase agreement, asset purchase

not knowingly, intentionally or materially breached this Section 5.2, (iii)
the Board of Directors of Company or the Special Committee determines in good
faith, after consultation with its financial advisors and outside counsel,

result in a Superior Proposal and (iv) after consultation with its outside
counsel, the Board of Directors of Company or the Special
Committee determines in good faith that failure to take such action would be
inconsistent with its fiduciary duties to the stockholders of Company under
applicable Law, then Company may (A) furnish information with respect to
Company and its Subsidiaries to the Person making such Acquisition Proposal
and (B) participate in discussions or negotiations with the Person making such
Acquisition Proposal regarding such Acquisition Proposal; _provided_ , that
Company (x) will not, and will not allow its Subsidiaries to, and will cause

Confidentiality Agreement with such Person and (y) will promptly provide or
make available to Parent any non-public information concerning Company or its

inquiry or request), including any material modifications thereto. Company
shall promptly (within 24 hours) notify Parent in the event that Company or
any of its Subsidiaries or its or their respective Representatives enters

35  any Person subsequent to the date of this Agreement except with respect to
an Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement as permitted or required pursuant to
this Section 5.2, and neither Company nor any of its Subsidiaries shall be a
party to any agreement that prohibits Company from providing or making

During the period beginning on the date of this Agreement and continuing until
the Effective Time, Company shall not, and shall cause each of its
Subsidiaries not to, terminate, waive, amend or modify any provision of, or

agreement (other than any confidentiality agreement that is not related to an

Company shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries to, enforce the provisions of
any such agreement.

(d) Notwithstanding anything in Section 5.2(a)(ii) to the contrary, the Board
of Directors of Company or the Special Committee may at any time prior to
obtaining the Company Requisite Vote, if it determines in good faith, after
consultation with outside counsel, that the failure to take such action
would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties to the stockholders of
Company under applicable Law: (x) withdraw, modify or qualify, or propose
publicly to withdraw, modify or qualify, in a manner adverse to Parent or
Merger Sub, the recommendation of the Board of Directors of Company and the
Special Committee that the holders of Common Shares adopt this Agreement and
approve the transactions contemplated hereby, including the Merger (the "
_Company Board Recommendation_ "); approve, recommend or endorse, or propose
publicly to approve, recommend or endorse, any Acquisition Proposal; or make
other statements that are reasonably calculated or expected to have the same
effect (any of the actions referred to in this clause (x) being a " _Change
of Board Recommendation_ "); and/or (y) if Company receives an Acquisition
Proposal which the Board of Directors of Company or the Special Committee
concludes in good faith, after consultation with outside counsel and its
financial advisors, constitutes a Superior Proposal, after considering all of
the adjustments to the terms of this Agreement which may be offered by Parent
including pursuant to clause (ii) below, terminate this Agreement and enter
into a definitive agreement with respect to such Superior Proposal (
_provided_ , that and in such event, Company concurrently enters into such
definitive agreement); _provided, however_ , that Company may not
terminate this Agreement pursuant to the foregoing clause (y), and any
purported termination pursuant to the foregoing clause (y) shall be void and
of no force or effect, unless in advance of or concurrently with such
termination Company pays the Termination Fee pursuant to Section 7.6, and
otherwise complies with the provisions of Article VII; and _provided further_
that neither the Board of Directors of Company nor the Special Committee may
withdraw, modify or amend the Company Board Recommendation in a manner
adverse to Parent pursuant to the foregoing clause (x) (in the case where the
Board of Directors of Company or the Special Committee is considering another
Acquisition Proposal) or terminate this Agreement pursuant to the foregoing
clause (y) unless (A) Company shall not have knowingly, intentionally or
materially breached this Section 5.2 and (B):

(i) Company shall have provided prior written notice to Parent at least five
(5) days in advance (the " _Notice Period_ ") of its intention to take such
action with respect to such Superior Proposal, which notice shall specify the
material terms and conditions of any such Superior Proposal (including the
identity of the party making such Superior Proposal), and shall have
contemporaneously provided a copy of the relevant proposed transaction
agreements with the party making such Superior Proposal and other material
documents, including the definitive agreement with respect to such
Superior Proposal (the " _Alternative Acquisition Agreement_ "); and

(ii) prior to effecting such Change of Board Recommendation or terminating
this Agreement to enter into a definitive agreement with respect to such
Superior Proposal, Company shall, and shall cause its financial and legal
advisors to, during the Notice Period, negotiate with Parent in good faith
(to the extent Parent desires to negotiate) to make such adjustments in the
terms and conditions of this Agreement so that such Acquisition Proposal
ceases to constitute a 



 

36  Superior Proposal. In the event of any material revisions to a Superior
Proposal (including, without limitation, any revision in price), Company shall
be required to deliver a new written notice to Parent and to again comply
with the requirements of Section 5.2(d)(i) with respect to such new written
notice except that the Notice Period with respect thereto shall be five (5)
days for the first such material revision to a Superior Proposal and three
(3) days for each subsequent material revision to a Superior Proposal
thereafter.

(e) Company agrees that any violations of the restrictions in this Section
5.2 by any Representative of Company or any of its Subsidiaries shall be
deemed to be a breach of this Section 5.2 by Company.

Directors of Company or the Special Committee from taking and disclosing to
the stockholders of Company a position contemplated by Rule 14e-2(a) and Rule
14d-9 promulgated under the Exchange Act, if such statement constitutes a
Change of Board Recommendation, then it shall have the effects of a Change of
Board Recommendation for all purposes under this Agreement.

(g) Company shall not take any action to exempt any Person (other than
Parent, Merger Sub and their respective Affiliates) from the restrictions on
"business combinations" contained in Section 203 of the DGCL (or any similar
provisions of any other Law) or otherwise cause such restrictions not to
apply.

(h) For purposes of this Agreement, (i) " _Acquisition Proposal_ " means
any inquiry, proposal or offer from any Person or group of Persons other than
Parent, Merger Sub or their respective Affiliates relating to any direct or

the net revenues of Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, or 15% or
more of any class of equity securities of Company or any of its Subsidiaries,
any tender offer or exchange offer that if consummated would result in any
Person or group of Persons beneficially owning 15% or more of any class of
equity securities of Company or any of its Subsidiaries, or any merger,
reorganization, consolidation, share exchange, business combination,
recapitalization, liquidation, dissolution or similar transaction involving
Company or any of its Subsidiaries whose business constitutes 15% or more of
the net revenues of Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, (ii) "
_Superior Proposal_ " means any bona fide Acquisition Proposal (except that
references to "15% or more" will be deemed to be references to "more than
85%") that (x) is on terms that the Board of Directors of Company or the
Special Committee has determined in its good faith judgment (after
consultation with its financial advisor and outside counsel and after taking
into account all legal, financial, regulatory and other aspects of the
proposal, including the financing terms thereof) is more favorable to
Companys stockholders from a financial point of view than the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement; and (y) which the Board of Directors of
Company or the Special Committee has determined in good faith (after
consultation with its financial advisor and outside counsel and after taking
into account all legal, financial, regulatory and other aspects of the
proposal) is reasonably capable of being consummated (taking into account the
financability of such proposal); _provided, however_ , that any such
Acquisition Proposal shall not be deemed to be a "Superior Proposal" if such
Acquisition Proposal is subject to a financing contingency and (iii) "
_Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement_ " means a confidentiality agreement
that contains confidentiality provisions that are in the aggregate no less
favorable to Company than those contained in the Confidentiality Agreement;
_provided_ , that any such confidentiality agreement and any related
agreements shall not include any provision calling for any exclusive right to
negotiate with such party or having the effect of prohibiting Company from
satisfying its obligations under this Agreement including providing the
required information pursuant to Section 5.2.

Section 5.2(d), the Proxy Statement shall include the Company Board
Recommendation. As promptly as practicable after the execution of
this Agreement, and in any event no later than twenty-five (25) days
following the date of this Agreement, Company shall file with the SEC the
preliminary Proxy Statement and, thereafter, shall use its reasonable best
efforts to have the preliminary Proxy Statement cleared by the SEC as
promptly as practicable; _provided, however_ , that Company shall furnish such
preliminary Proxy Statement to Parent and give Parent and its legal counsel a
reasonable opportunity to review such preliminary Proxy Statement prior to
filing with the SEC and shall accept all reasonable additions, deletions or
changes suggested by Parent in connection therewith. Company shall notify
Parent of the receipt of any comments from the SEC staff with respect to the
preliminary Proxy Statement and of any requests by the SEC for any amendment
or supplement thereto or for additional information and shall provide to
Parent as promptly as reasonably practicable, copies of all written
correspondence (and summaries of any oral comments) between Company or any
Representative of Company and the SEC with respect to the Proxy Statement.
Company shall provide Parent and its legal counsel with a reasonable
opportunity to review and comment on any proposed response to any comment of
the SEC staff and any amendment or supplement to each of the preliminary and
the definitive Proxy Statement prior to filing with the SEC and shall accept
all reasonable additions, deletions or changes suggested by Parent in
connection therewith. Parent and Merger Sub shall promptly provide Company
with such information as may be required to be included in the Proxy Statement
or as may be reasonably required to respond to any comment of the SEC staff.
After all the comments received from the SEC have been cleared by the SEC
staff and all information required to be contained in the Proxy Statement have
been included therein by Company, Company shall file the definitive Proxy
Statement with the SEC and cause the Proxy Statement to be disseminated
(including by electronic delivery if permitted) as promptly as reasonably
practicable, to its stockholders of record, as of the record date established
by the Board of Directors of Company or the Special Committee. Each of the
parties hereto shall correct promptly, any information provided by it to be
used specifically in the Proxy Statement, if required, that shall have become
false or misleading in any material respect and shall take all steps necessary
to file with the SEC and have cleared by the SEC any amendment or supplement
to the Proxy Statement so as to correct the same and to cause the Proxy
Statement as so corrected to be disseminated to the stockholders of Company,
in each case to the extent required by applicable Law.

(b) Company and Parent shall cooperate with each other in order to lift any
injunctions or remove any other impediment to the consummation of the
transactions contemplated herein.



 

39 (c) Company shall take all action necessary in accordance with the DGCL and
its certificate of incorporation and by-laws to duly call, give notice of,
convene and hold a meeting of the holders of Common Shares as promptly as
reasonably practicable following the date of this Agreement (and in any event,
no later than forty (40) days after the filing of the definitive Proxy
Statement with the SEC) for the purpose of obtaining the Company Requisite
Vote (the " _Company Meeting_ ") and, except in the event of a Change of Board
Recommendation specifically permitted by Section 5.2(d), Company shall
include in the Proxy Statement the Company Board Recommendation. Except in the
event of a Change of Board Recommendation specifically permitted by Section
5.2(d), the Board of Directors of Company and the Special Committee shall use
their reasonable best efforts to obtain from the holders of Common Shares the
Company Requisite Vote in favor of the adoption of this Agreement, and the
Board of Directors of Company and the Special Committee shall publicly
reaffirm the Company Board Recommendation within 48 hours after any such
request by Parent. Unless this Agreement is validly terminated in accordance
with its terms pursuant to Article VII, Company shall submit this Agreement to
the holders of Common Shares at the Company Meeting even if its Board of
Directors shall have withdrawn, modified or qualified the Company Board
Recommendation or otherwise effected a Change of Board Recommendation or
proposed or announced any intention to do so.

(d) Unless this Agreement is validly terminated in accordance with its terms
pursuant to Article VII, neither the commencement, disclosure, announcement
or submission to Company of an Acquisition Proposal (whether or not a Superior
Proposal), nor any furnishing of information, discussions or negotiations with
respect thereto, nor any decision or action by the Board of Directors of
Company to effect a Change of Board Recommendation shall give Company any
right to delay, defer or adjourn the Company Meeting. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, Company may adjourn or postpone the Company Meeting with the
consent of Parent (and shall so adjourn or postpone the Company Meeting if
requested to do so by Parent) to the extent necessary to ensure that any
required supplement or amendment to the Proxy Statement is provided to
Companys stockholders or, if as of the time the Company Meeting is scheduled
(as set forth in the Proxy Statement), there are insufficient Common Shares
represented (either in person or by proxy) to constitute a quorum necessary to
conduct the business of the Company Meeting. 

5.6 _Stock Exchange De-listing_. Parent shall, or shall cause the Surviving

thereafter, subject to Section 5.2, Company and Parent each shall consult with

hereby and prior to making any filings with any third party and/or any

purposes, including eligibility to participate, vesting, benefit accrual,
vacation entitlement and severance benefits) for service with Company or the
Company Subsidiaries (or predecessor employers to the extent Company provides
such past service credit) under the comparable employee benefit plans,
programs and policies of Parent or the Surviving Corporation, as applicable,
in which such employees 



 

40  become participants, except to the extent to which such service credit would
result in the duplication of benefit accrual for the same period of service.

(b) Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to assume and honor in
accordance with their terms all Company Compensation and Benefit Plans
applicable to employees of Company and each of its Subsidiaries to the extent
specifically listed on Section 3.1(j) of Company Disclosure Schedules,
including, without limitation, those employment agreements with certain key
executives of Company disclosed on Section 5.8(b) of the Company Disclosure
Schedule (the " _Executive Employment Agreements_ "), subject (i) in each case
to the amendment and termination provisions of those Company Compensation and
Benefit Plans and (ii) in the case of the Executive Employment Agreements to
the Executive Waivers being in full force and effect at the Effective Time.

(c) Nothing contained in this Agreement shall confer upon any employee any
right with respect to continuance of employment by Parent, the Surviving
Corporation or Company, nor shall anything herein interfere with the right of
any of them to terminate the employment of any employee at any time, with or
without cause, or restrict Parent, the Surviving Corporation or Company in the
exercise of its independent business judgment in modifying any of the terms
and conditions of the employment of any employee following the Effective Time.
Nothing in this Agreement shall create any third party beneficiary rights in
any employee or other Person not a signatory to this Agreement, any
beneficiary or dependents thereof, or any collective bargaining
representative thereof, with respect to the compensation, terms and conditions
of employment and benefits that may be provided to any employee or under any
benefit plan. Nothing contained in this Agreement shall amend, or be deemed
to amend, any Company Compensation and Benefit Plan or limit in any way
Parents, the Surviving Corporations, or Companys ability to amend or
terminate any Company Compensation and Benefit Plan at any time.

5.9 _Indemnification; Directors  and Officers Insurance_.

(a) The Surviving Corporation shall indemnify, hold harmless and advance
expenses, to the fullest extent required pursuant to the indemnity agreements
of Company identified on Section 5.9 of the Company Disclosure Schedules (the

incorporation and by-laws of the Surviving Corporation, each present
and former director and officer of Company and its Subsidiaries

actually incurred in connection with any claim, action, suit, proceeding or
investigation, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative,
arising out of or pertaining to matters existing or occurring at or prior to

contemplated hereby, _provided_ the Person to whom expenses are advanced
provides an undertaking to repay such advances if it is ultimately determined
that such Person is not entitled to indemnification.

(b) Company shall maintain its existing officers and directors liability
insurance (" _D andO Insurance_") coverage for Companys directors and officers
for a period of six (6) years after the Effective Time or cause to be obtained
at the Effective Time "tail" insurance policies with a claims period of at
least six (6) years from the Effective Time, so long as the annual premium
therefor is not in excess of 175% of the last annual premium paid prior to the
date hereof (which last annual premium Company represents and warrants to be
$276,000 in the aggregate).

(c) The certificate of incorporation and by-laws of the Surviving Corporation
shall include provisions for exculpation of director liability, advancement of
expenses and indemnification no less favorable than as set forth in Companys
certificate of incorporation and by-laws in effect on the date hereof for six
(6) years after the Effective Time.



 

41 (d) The rights of each Indemnified Party under this Section 5.9 shall be in
addition to any right such Person might have under the certificate of
incorporation or by-laws of Company or any of its Subsidiaries, or under
applicable Law (including the DGCL) or under any agreement of any Indemnified
Party with Company or any of its Subsidiaries. The provisions of this Section
5.9 are intended to be for the benefit of, and shall be enforceable by, each
of the Indemnified Parties, their respective heirs and representatives.

5.10 _Expenses_. Subject to Section 7.6, whether or not the Merger is

incurring such expense, except that each of Company and Parent shall bear and
pay one-half of the costs and expenses incurred in connection with the
filing, printing and mailing of the Proxy Statement, if any (including any
SEC filing fees), and with the filing of any notifications required to be made
with the Federal Trade Commission or the Department of Justice under the HSR
Act.

5.11 _Takeover Statute_. If any Takeover Statute is or may become applicable
to the Merger, any Voting Agreement or the other transactions contemplated
hereby, each of Parent, Company and Merger Sub and their respective Board of
Directors (including, in the case of Company, the Special Committee) shall
grant such approvals and take such actions as are necessary so that
the transactions contemplated hereby may be consummated as promptly as
practicable hereafter on the terms contemplated hereby and otherwise act to
eliminate or minimize the effects of such statute or regulation on such
transactions. " _Takeover Statute_ " shall mean any restrictive provision of
any applicable "fair price," "moratorium," "control share acquisition,"
"interested stockholder" or other similar anti takeover Law,
including Section 203 of the DGCL.

5.12 _Section 16 Matters_. Prior to the Effective Time, Parent and Company

may be abandoned by action of the Board of Directors of Company or the Special
Committee if:

(a) at any time prior to obtaining the Company Requisite Vote, the Board of
Directors of Company or the Special Committee approves or enters into an
Alternative Acquisition Agreement; _provided, however_ , that (i) Company may
not effect such termination unless Company is not then in material breach of

be effective unless Company shall at or prior to the time of such termination

any approval of the matters presented in connection with the Merger by the
stockholders of Company, Parent or Merger Sub shall have breached or failed to
perform any of its representations, warranties, covenants or agreements
contained in this Agreement, which breach or failure to perform (1) would
result in a failure of a condition set forth in Section 6.1 or Section 6.2 and

have given Parent written notice, delivered at least thirty (30) days prior
to such termination (or such shorter number of days as may exist between the

or any Excluded Owner individually acquiring an additional five percent (5%)
or more of the outstanding Common Shares; or

(d) Company shall have breached or failed to perform any of its

with no liability on the part of Company, Parent or Merger Sub, other than the
provisions of Section 7.6 (and any other provision herein related to fees and
expenses), this Section 7.5 and Article VIII, which provisions shall survive

subject to the last sentence of Section 7.6(a) and the last sentence of
Section 7.6(c) and the last two sentences of Section 7.6(d)) shall relieve any
party hereto of any liability or damages resulting from any willful or knowing
breach of a covenant contained in this Agreement prior to the date of such
termination or alter the provisions of the Confidentiality Agreement. As used
in this Section 7.5 and Section 7.6(d), a "knowing breach" of a covenant means
either (i) a breach that is expressly attributable to a party as provided
herein, such as to Company under Section 5.2(e), or (ii) a breach that a party
did not subjectively think was permissible hereunder, that the party thought
was an intentional breach on a subjective level, or which is an action in
reckless disregard (determined under New York law) for the genuine rights of
the other party with respect to the other partys rights hereunder.

7.6 _Fees and Expenses_.

(a) In the event that:

(i) Company terminates this Agreement pursuant to Section 7.3(a); or

(ii) Parent terminates this Agreement pursuant to Section 7.4(a) or Section
7.4(b):

then, in any such event Company shall pay Parent substantially simultaneously
(or if the payment is pursuant to Section 7.6(a)(ii) promptly (but in
no event later than one (1) Business Day) after the first of such events
shall have occurred) a fee of $4,000,000 (Four Million Dollars) (the "
_Termination Fee_ "), by wire transfer of same day funds to an account
previously designated in writing by Parent or Merger Sub. 



 

46  Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement to the contrary,
Parents and Merger Subs sole and exclusive remedy, including on account of
punitive damages, in the circumstances in which the Termination Fee is
payable pursuant to Section 7.6(a) shall be payment of the Termination Fee in
accordance with the terms hereof, and Parent and Merger Sub shall be precluded
from any other remedy against Company and its Affiliates, at law or in equity
or otherwise.

(b) (i) In the event that (A) either Parent or Company terminates
this Agreement pursuant to Section 7.2(a) or, subject to the penultimate
sentence of Section 7.6(c), Section 7.2(b), or Parent terminates this
Agreement pursuant to Section 7.4(c) or Section 7.4(d), and (B) in any such
case an Acquisition Proposal shall have been publicly announced and not
withdrawn, or otherwise become publicly known after the date of this
Agreement, and, (C) within twelve (12) months after such termination, Company
either enters into a definitive agreement relating to an Acquisition Proposal
(which, for the purposes of clause (C) of this Section 7.6(b), shall have the
meaning set forth in Section 5.2(h), except that "50%" shall be substituted
for "15%" throughout such definition) or an Acquisition Proposal is
consummated, then, in any such event Company shall pay Parent the Termination
Fee, less any Parent Expenses paid previously by Company pursuant to Section
7.6(b)(ii), not later than the later of two (2) Business Days after the
announcement or completion of such transaction, by wire transfer of same day
funds to an account previously designated in writing by Parent or Merger Sub;
and

(ii) In the event that either Parent or Company terminates this Agreement
pursuant to Section 7.2(a) or Section 7.2(b), or Parent terminates this
Agreement pursuant to Section 7.4(d), and neither Parent nor Merger Sub is in
material breach of its material covenants and agreements contained in this
Agreement, then, in such event Company shall reimburse each of Parent and
Merger Sub (not later than three (3) Business Days after submission thereof)
for all out-of-pocket expenses and fees actually incurred by Parent, Merger
Sub and their Affiliates in connection with this Agreement and the
transactions contemplated hereby and all prior negotiations between Company
and Parent, Merger Sub and their Affiliates (including in each case the actual
fees of legal, accounting and financial advisors, consultants and travel and
lodging expenses of employees of Parent, Merger Sub and their Affiliates
engaged in such transactions), up to $800,000 (Eight Hundred Thousand Dollars)
in the aggregate (" _Parent Expenses_ "), by wire transfer of same day funds
to an account previously designated in writing by Parent or Merger Sub.

(c) In the event that:

(i) Company terminates this Agreement pursuant to Section 7.3(b); or

(ii) either Parent or Company terminates this Agreement pursuant to Section
7.2(b):

and in either such case all of the conditions to Parents and Merger Subs
obligation to effect the Merger set forth in Section 6.1 and Section 6.3
shall have been satisfied as if the date of such satisfaction was the Closing
Date (the " _Company Obligations_ "), and the Effective Time shall not have
occurred due to a breach of this Agreement by Parent or Merger Sub (which,
for purposes of this Section 7.6(c) shall be deemed to have occurred if Parent
has not closed as of the Termination Date and all of the Company Obligations
have been satisfied as of the Business Day prior to the Termination
Date), then Parent shall pay Company a fee of $4,500,000 (Four Million Five
Hundred Thousand Dollars) (the " _Parent Fee_ "), by wire transfer of same day
funds to an account previously designated in writing by Company not later than
three (3) Business Days after such event of termination. In the event that
the Parent Fee is paid under this Agreement, Parents rights to the
Termination Fee under Section 7.6(b) shall be terminated. Notwithstanding any
other provision of this Agreement to the contrary, Companys sole and
exclusive remedy, including on account of punitive damages and for willful and
knowing breach of this Agreement, 



 

47  shall be payment of the Parent Fee in accordance with the terms hereof and
of the Limited Guarantee, and Company shall be precluded from any other remedy
against Parent, Merger Sub, the Sponsors and their respective Affiliates, at
law or in equity or otherwise.

(d) The parties hereto acknowledge that the agreements contained in Section
7.6 are an integral part of the Transactions, and that, without this agreement
the parties would not have entered into this Agreement; accordingly, if either
party fails to promptly pay any amounts due pursuant to Section 7.6, and in
order to obtain such payment the other party commences a suit which results in
a judgment against the other party for payment of all or a portion of the
Termination Fee, Parent Expenses or the Parent Fee, as applicable, the non-
prevailing party shall pay to the prevailing party its costs and expenses
(including its reasonable attorneys fees) incurred in connection with such
suit, together with interest from the date of termination of this Agreement on
the amounts owed at the prime rate in effect from time to time and quoted in
_The Wall Street Journal_ during such period. The payment of the Termination
Fee or the Parent Fee, as applicable, shall be the sole and exclusive remedy,
including on account of punitive damages, of a party with respect to the
facts and circumstances giving rise to such payment obligation except to the
extent such facts or circumstances constitute or arise from willful or knowing
breach of the other partys obligations (subject to the last sentence of
Section 7.6(a) and the last sentence of Section 7.6(c) and the last two
sentences of this Section 7.6(d)). The parties acknowledge and agree that the
Termination Fee and the Parent Fee constitute liquidated damages and are not
a penalty. The Termination Fee provided for in this Section 7.6 is payable
whether or not there has been a breach of this Agreement. In no event, whether
or not this Agreement has been terminated pursuant to any provision hereof,
shall Parent, Merger Sub, the Sponsors or any of their respective Affiliates,
either individually or in the aggregate, be subject to any liability in excess
of the Parent Fee for any or all losses or damages relating to or arising out
of this Agreement or the Limited Guarantee or the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement and the Limited Guarantee, including breaches by Parent or
Merger Sub of any representations, warranties, covenants or agreements
contained in this Agreement, and in no event shall Company seek equitable
relief or seek to recover any money damages in excess of such amount from
Parent, Merger Sub, the Sponsors or any of their respective Affiliates. In no
event, whether or not this Agreement has been terminated pursuant to any
provision hereof, shall Company or any of its Affiliates, either individually
or in the aggregate, be subject to any liability in excess of the Termination
Fee for any or all losses or damages relating to or arising out of this
Agreement or the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including
breaches by Company of any representations, warranties, covenants or
agreements contained in this Agreement, except in connection with any willful
or knowing breach of this Agreement or any breach of Companys obligations
under Section 5.2.
