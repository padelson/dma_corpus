Effective Time (other than shares canceled in accordance with _Section_ __ _
3.2(a)(ii)_) shall be automatically converted into the right to receive a
number of shares or, subject to _Section_ __ _ 3.4_, a fraction of a share,
of RMT Partner Common Stock equal to the Exchange Ratio, subject to
adjustment in accordance with _Section_ __ _ 3.2(a)(iv)_ and _Section_ __ _
3.2(d)_.

 

(ii) Each share of Spinco Common Stock held by Spinco as treasury stock or by
Remainco (other than shares of Spinco Common Stock held for the sole benefit
of Persons other than a member of the Remainco Group), in each case, following
the Distribution and immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be canceled
and shall cease to exist and no stock or other consideration shall be issued
or delivered in exchange therefor.

(iii) Each share of Spinco Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective Time, when converted in accordance with this _Section_

and shall cease to exist, and each holder of such shares shall cease to have

change with respect to RMT Partner Common Stock or Spinco Common Stock having

__ _ 3.2(a)(iv)_ shall be construed to permit Remainco, Spinco or RMT Partner

29

    

(b) _Merger Sub Common Stock_. At the Effective Time, each share of common
stock, par value $0.01 per share, of Merger Sub (" _Merger Sub Common Stock_

following the consummation of the Merger (including (i) any instruments that
are treated as equity for U.S. federal income Tax purposes and (ii) any

received in the Merger by holders of Spinco Common Stock immediately prior to
the Effective Time with respect to Qualified Spinco Common Stock pursuant to
_Section_ __ _ 3.2(a)(i)_ represents the Threshold Percentage. The Parties
agree that this _Section_ __ _ 3.2(d)_ is intended to ensure that the Merger
does not cause Section 355(e) of the Code to apply to the Distribution, and
that this _Section_ __ _ 3.2(d)_ shall be interpreted consistently therewith,
including with respect to any calculation of the Threshold Percentage.

 

Section 3.3 Distribution of RMT Partner Common Stock.

 

(a) _Distribution Agent_. Pursuant to Article IV of the Separation and
Distribution Agreement, the Exchange Agent (as defined below, and acting as

shares of Spinco Common Stock distributed in the Distribution. Such shares of
Spinco Common Stock shall be converted into shares of RMT Partner Common Stock
in accordance with the terms of this _Section_ __ _ 3.3_.

 

(b) _Exchange Agent_. Prior to the Effective Time, Remainco shall appoint the
agent set forth on Section 3.3(b) of the Spinco Disclosure Schedule as
exchange agent in the Merger (the " _Exchange Agent_ ") pursuant to a
customary exchange agent agreement (to which Remainco, Spinco and RMT Partner
shall be parties) providing for, among other things, the matters set forth in
this _Section_ __ _ 3.3_ and otherwise reasonably satisfactory to the
parties. Prior to or at the Effective Time, RMT Partner shall deposit or cause
to be deposited with the Exchange Agent, for the benefit of Persons who

distribution in accordance with this _Article III_ , through the Exchange
Agent, shares of RMT Partner Common Stock in book-entry form representing the
shares of RMT Partner Common Stock issuable pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 3.2_

distributions with respect thereto pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 3.3(d)_ and

instructions which shall be delivered from RMT Partner to the Exchange Agent
immediately following the Effective Time, deliver the RMT Partner Common Stock
contemplated to be issued pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 3.2_ from the shares of
RMT Partner Common Stock held in the Exchange Fund. If RMT Partner deposits
such shares into the Exchange Fund prior to the Effective Time and the Merger
is not consummated, the Exchange Agent shall promptly return such shares to
RMT Partner. If for any reason the Exchange Fund is inadequate to deliver all
shares of RMT Partner Common Stock in respect of the conversion of shares of
Spinco Common Stock for shares of RMT Partner Common Stock pursuant to
_Section_ __ _ 3.2(a)(i)_, RMT Partner shall take all steps necessary to, at
or prior to the Effective Time, deposit in trust with the Exchange Agent
additional shares of RMT Partner Common Stock sufficient to make all such
deliveries. The Exchange Fund shall not be used for any other purpose.

shares of RMT Partner Common Stock, as contemplated by  _Section_ __ _ 3.4_,
together with any dividends or other distributions pursuant to _Section_ __ _
3.3(d)_). The Exchange Agent shall not be entitled to vote or exercise any
rights of ownership with respect to RMT Partner Common Stock held by it from
time to time hereunder, except that it shall receive and hold all dividends or
other distributions paid or distributed with respect thereto for the account
of the Persons entitled thereto.

 

(ii) From and after the Effective Time, any shares formerly representing
shares of Spinco Common Stock will represent only the right to receive shares
of RMT Partner Common Stock (and cash in lieu of any fractional share of RMT
Partner Common Stock as contemplated by _Section_ __ _ 3.4_ and any dividends
or other distributions pursuant to  _Section_ __ _ 3.3(d)_).

(d) _Distributions with Respect to Undistributed Shares_. No dividends or
other distributions declared or made with respect to RMT Partner Common Stock
with a record date after the Effective Time shall be paid or otherwise
delivered to the former holders of Spinco Common Stock with respect to any
shares of RMT Partner Common Stock that are not able to be distributed by the
Exchange Agent to such holder promptly after the Effective Time, whether due
to a legal impediment to such distribution or otherwise. Subject to the effect
of applicable Laws, following the distribution of any such previously
undistributed shares of RMT Partner Common Stock, there shall be paid to the
record holder of such shares of RMT Partner Common Stock, without interest,
(i) at the time of the distribution, to the extent not previously paid, the
amount of cash payable in lieu of fractional shares of RMT Partner Common
Stock to which such holder is entitled pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 3.4_ and
the amount of dividends or other distributions with a record date after the
Effective Time theretofore paid with respect to such whole shares of RMT
Partner Common Stock, and (ii) at the appropriate payment date therefor, the
amount of dividends or other distributions with a record date after
the Effective Time but prior to the distribution of such shares of RMT
Partner Common Stock and a payment date subsequent to the distribution of such
shares of RMT Partner Common Stock payable with respect to such whole shares
of RMT Partner Common Stock. RMT Partner shall deposit in the Exchange Fund
all such dividends and distributions.

(including proceeds of any investment thereof, if any) that remains

anniversary of the Merger shall, subject to any abandoned property,
escheat or similar Law, be delivered to RMT Partner, upon demand, and any
former holders of Spinco Common Stock who have not theretofore received shares
of RMT Partner Common Stock in accordance with this _Article III_ shall

consideration to which they are entitled pursuant to _Section_ __ _
3.2(a)(i)_, any cash in lieu of fractional shares of RMT Partner Common Stock
to which they may be entitled pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 3.4_ and any
dividends or other distributions with respect to the RMT Partner Common Stock
to which they may be entitled pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 3.3(d)_ (subject to
any abandoned property, escheat or similar law).

(f) _No Liability_. None of Remainco, Spinco, RMT Partner, Merger Sub, the
Surviving Corporation or the Exchange Agent shall be liable to any Person for
any portion of the Exchange Fund (or dividends or distributions with respect
to RMT Partner Common Stock) or any cash properly delivered to a public
official in accordance with any applicable abandoned property, escheat or
similar Law.

(g) _No Appraisal Rights_. In accordance with Section 262 of the DGCL, no
appraisal rights shall be available to holders of Spinco Common Stock in
connection with the Merger.

(h) _Spinco Stock Transfer Books_. From and after the Effective Time, the

Section 3.4 Fractional Shares.

 

(a) No certificates or scrip representing fractional shares of RMT Partner
Common Stock or book-entry credit of the same shall be issued to any holder
of Spinco Common Stock upon the conversion of Spinco Common Stock, and such
fractional share interests will not entitle the owner thereof to vote, or to
any other rights of a stockholder of RMT Partner. All fractional shares of RMT
Partner Common Stock that a holder of shares of Spinco Common Stock would
otherwise be entitled to receive as a result of the Merger shall be aggregated
by the Exchange Agent. The Exchange Agent shall cause the whole shares
obtained thereby to be sold on behalf of such holders of shares of Spinco
Common Stock that would otherwise be entitled to receive such fractional
shares of RMT Partner Common Stock pursuant to the Merger, in the open market
or otherwise, in each case at then-prevailing market prices, and in no case
later than five (5) Business Days after the time of the Merger. The Exchange
Agent shall make available the net proceeds thereof, subject to the deduction
of the amount of any withholding Taxes and brokerage charges, commissions and
conveyance and similar Taxes, on a _pro rata_ basis, without interest, as soon
as practicable to the holders of Spinco Common Stock that would otherwise be
entitled to receive such fractional shares of RMT Partner Common
Stock pursuant to the Merger. Until the proceeds of such sale or sales have
been distributed to the holders of Spinco Common Stock, the Exchange Agent
shall hold such proceeds in trust for the holders of Spinco Common Stock that
would otherwise be entitled to receive such fractional shares of RMT Partner
Common Stock pursuant to the Merger.

 



32

    

(b) Remainco, Spinco, RMT Partner and Merger Sub acknowledge that payment of
the cash consideration in lieu of issuing fractional shares of RMT Partner
Common Stock was not separately bargained-for consideration but merely
represents a mechanical rounding off for purposes of avoiding the expense and
inconvenience to RMT Partner that would otherwise be caused by the issuance
of fractional shares of RMT Partner Common Stock.

Section 5.7 Remainco Internal Controls. Remainco maintains disclosure controls

disclosed by Remainco with respect to the Spinco Business is reported on a
timely basis to the individuals responsible for the preparation of Remaincos
filings with the SEC and other public disclosure documents. Remaincos
management has completed an assessment of the effectiveness of Remaincos
internal control over financial reporting in compliance with the requirements
of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act for the fiscal year ended December
31, 2018, and such assessment concluded that such internal control system was
effective. Remaincos independent registered public accountant has issued (and
not subsequently withdrawn or qualified) an attestation report concluding
that Remainco maintained effective internal control over financial reporting
as of December 31, 2018. Remaincos internal control over financial reporting
(as defined in Rule 13a-15 or 15d-15, as applicable, under the Exchange Act)
is effective in providing reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of
financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external
purposes in accordance with GAAP and includes policies and procedures that (i)
pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and
fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of Remainco,
(ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary
to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with GAAP, and
that receipts and expenditures of Remainco are being made only in accordance
with authorizations of management and directors of Remainco and (iii) provide
reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized
acquisition, use or disposition of Remaincos assets that could have a
material effect on its financial statements. Remainco has disclosed, based on
its most recent evaluation of internal controls prior to the date hereof, to
Remaincos auditors and the audit committee of the Remainco Board (i) any
significant deficiencies or material weaknesses in the design or operation of
its internal controls over financial reporting which are reasonably likely to
adversely affect Remaincos ability to record, process, summarize and report
financial information with respect to the Spinco Business and (ii) any fraud,
whether or not material, that involves management or other employees who have
a significant role in Remaincos internal control over financial
reporting with respect to the Spinco Business.

Section 5.8 Conversion Equity Awards. Section 5.8 of the Spinco Disclosure
Schedule sets forth a true, correct and complete list of all Conversion Equity
Awards outstanding as of December 9, 2019, and held by a Spinco Employee (each
as identified as of the date hereof), specifying for each holder, on a
holder-by-holder basis: (i) the number of shares subject to each such
Conversion Equity Award (assuming target achievement for any Remainco PSU
Award (as defined in the Employee Matters Agreement)), (ii) the grant date of
each such Conversion Equity Award, (iii) the exercise price for each such
Conversion Equity Award, to the extent applicable, (iv) the portion of such
Conversion Equity Award that is unvested and vested (treating restricted stock
units as unvested for this purpose even if no longer subject to a continued
service requirement), (v) the vesting schedule for such Conversion Equity
Award, (vi) the expiration date of each such Conversion Equity Award, to the
extent applicable, (vii) the Remainco Stock Plan pursuant to which the
Conversion Equity Award was granted and (viii) for each Remainco Option (as
defined in the Employee Matters Agreement), whether such option is a
nonqualified stock option or incentive stock option. With respect to each
grant of Conversion Equity Awards, each such grant was made substantially in
accordance with the terms of the Remainco Stock Plans, applicable securities
Laws, and all other applicable Law, including any applicable stock exchange
listing requirements and rules. Since December 9, 2019 no grant of any
Conversion Equity Award has been made.

Spinco Business had been operated on a stand-alone basis during such periods.

Statements and the Subsequent Audited Spinco Financial Statements will
reflect certain cost allocations, including of Remainco corporate assets and
liabilities, made that may not reflect what would have been incurred if the
Spinco Business had been a standalone business. The Audited Financial

Remainco Benefit Plans) or any trusts related thereto and no event
has occurred that would reasonably be expected to give rise to any such
claim, except where such claims would not reasonably be expected to have,

48

    

(d) Each Spinco Benefit Plan and each Remainco Benefit Plan that is intended
to be qualified under Section 401(a) of the Code has received or is
reasonably expected to receive a favorable determination letter from the IRS
or is entitled to rely on an advisory or opinion letter from the IRS, and, to
the knowledge of Remainco, nothing has occurred that would reasonably be
expected to result in the revocation of such favorable determination letter.

(e) No Spinco Benefit Plan is (i) an "employee pension benefit plan" (within
the meaning of Section 3(2) of ERISA) that is subject to Title IV or Section
302 of ERISA or Section 412 of the Code, nor has Spinco, any of its ERISA
Affiliates or any Remainco Entity sponsored, maintained or contributed to any
such plan in the six (6) years prior to the date hereof for the benefit of any
Spinco Employee or former employee of any Spinco Entities that would
reasonably be expected to result in a material liability to Spinco, (ii) a
"multiple employer plan" (within the meaning of Section 413 of the Code) or
(iii) a "multiple employer welfare arrangement" (within the meaning of Section
3(40) of ERISA).

(f) Except as would not reasonably be expected to, individually or in the
aggregate, result in any material liability to any Spinco Entity, with
respect to the Spinco Employees or former employees of any of the Spinco
Entities (including Former Spinco Business Employees), no Spinco Benefit Plan

Code that has not been satisfied in full and no condition exists that would
reasonably be expected to result in Spinco incurring any such liability
thereunder or (ii) has incurred any Withdrawal Liability that has not been
satisfied in full, in each case, except as would not reasonably be expected to
have, individually or in the aggregate, a Spinco Material Adverse Effect.

(h) Except as required by applicable Law or _Article IV_ hereof, neither the
execution and delivery of this Agreement or the other Transaction Documents
nor the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby
(either alone or in conjunction with any other event) would, except as
required solely by reason of applicable Law or as provided in the Employee
Matters Agreement, (i) result in, cause the vesting, exercisability or
delivery of, or increase the amount or value of, any material payment, right
or other benefit becoming due to any Spinco Employee, Former Spinco Business
Employee or any other current or former director or employee of any of the
Spinco Entities under any Spinco Benefit Plan, Remainco Benefit Plan or
otherwise, (ii) materially increase any benefits otherwise payable under
any Spinco Benefit Plan, Remainco Benefit Plan or otherwise, or (iii) result
in any material acceleration of the time of payment, funding or vesting under

49

    

(i) Neither the execution and delivery of this Agreement or the other
Transaction Documents nor the consummation of the transactions contemplated
hereby or thereby (either alone or in conjunction with any other event) would
result in the payment by Spinco or any of the Spinco Entities or Remainco of
any amount that would, individually or in combination with any other such
payment, constitute an "excess parachute payment" within the meaning of
Section 280G(b)(1) of the Code or any equivalent applicable Law. No Spinco
Benefit Plan or Remainco Benefit Plan provides for the gross-up or
reimbursement of Taxes under Section 409A or 4999 of the Code.

(j) Except as would not reasonably be expected to have, individually or in
the aggregate, a Spinco Material Adverse Effect, each Spinco Benefit Plan that

United States or that is subject to the Laws of a jurisdiction outside of the
United States (each, a " _Non-U.S. Spinco Benefit Plan_") and, to the extent
reasonably expected to result in liability to any of the Spinco
Entities, each Remainco Benefit Plan that is mandated by applicable Law or by
a Governmental Authority outside of the United States or that is subject to

qualify for special Tax treatment, meets all the requirements for such
treatment, (ii) if required to be registered has been registered and has been
maintained in good standing with applicable Law and the applicable

good standing of such Non-U.S. Spinco Benefit Plan (and, to the extent
reasonably expected to result in material liability to Spinco, such Remainco
Benefit Plan), and (iii) is funded, book-reserved or secured by an insurance
policy to the extent required by the terms of the applicable Non-U.S.
Spinco Benefit Plan or Remainco Benefit Plan or applicable Law, based on

are pending or, to the knowledge of Remainco, threatened with respect to the
foregoing. Except as would not reasonably be expected to have, individually or
in the aggregate, a Spinco Material Adverse Effect, each individual who
renders services to the Spinco Entities who is classified as an independent

received from the SEC staff with respect to the RMT Partner SEC Documents. As

furnish any form, report, registration statement, prospectus or other document

to the Securities Act) or, if amended, as of the date of (and giving effect
to) the last such amendment, the RMT Partner SEC Documents complied in all
material respects with the applicable requirements of the Exchange Act and
the Securities Act, and complied in all material respects with accounting
standards applicable thereto, and did not contain any untrue statement of a
material fact or omit to state a material fact required to be stated therein
or necessary to make the statements made therein, in the light of the
circumstances under which they were made, not misleading.

 

(b) Each of the consolidated balance sheets included in or incorporated by
reference into the RMT Partner SEC Documents (including the related notes and
schedules) fairly presents, in all material respects, the consolidated
financial position of RMT Partner and its Subsidiaries as of its date, and
each of the consolidated statements of operations, cash flows and changes
in shareholders equity included in or incorporated by reference into the RMT
Partner SEC Documents (including any related notes and schedules) fairly
presents, in all material respects, the results of operations, cash flows or
changes in shareholders equity, as the case may be, of RMT Partner and its
Subsidiaries for the periods set forth therein, in each case in accordance

10-Q or Form 8-K under the Exchange Act, (b) normal year-end audit
adjustments which have not been and are not expected to be material and (c)
any other adjustments stated therein or in the notes thereto).

 

(c) There are no Liabilities of RMT Partner or any of its Subsidiaries of any
nature required to be reflected on, or reserved against in, a balance sheet
of RMT Partner or in the notes thereto prepared in accordance with GAAP,
except for (a) Liabilities reflected or reserved for on the consolidated
balance sheet of RMT Partner or described in the notes thereto, in each
case included in RMT Partners annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended
December 31, 2018 or RMT Partners quarterly report on Form 10-Q for the

69

    

(e) RMT Partner maintains disclosure controls and procedures required by Rule
13a-15 or 15d-15 under the Exchange Act. Such disclosure controls and
procedures are designed to provide reasonable assurance that all information
required to be disclosed by RMT Partner is reported on a timely basis to the
individuals responsible for the preparation of RMT Partners filings with the
SEC and other public disclosure documents. RMT Partners management has
completed an assessment of the effectiveness of RMT Partners internal
control over financial reporting in compliance with the requirements of
Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act for the fiscal year ended December 31,
2018, and such assessment concluded that such internal control system was
effective. RMT Partners independent registered public accountant has issued
(and not subsequently withdrawn or qualified) an attestation report concluding
that RMT Partner maintained effective internal control over financial
reporting as of December 31, 2018. RMT Partners internal control over
financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15 or 15d-15, as applicable, under
the Exchange Act) is effective in providing reasonable assurance regarding the
reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements
for external purposes in accordance with GAAP and includes policies and
procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable
detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the
assets of RMT Partner, (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions
are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in
accordance with GAAP, and that receipts and expenditures of RMT Partner are
being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors
of RMT Partner and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or
timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of RMT
Partners assets that could have a material effect on its financial
statements. RMT Partner has disclosed, based on its most recent evaluation of
internal controls prior to the date hereof, to RMT Partners auditors and the
audit committee of the RMT Partner Board (i) any significant deficiencies or
material weaknesses in the design or operation of its internal controls over
financial reporting which are reasonably likely to adversely affect RMT
Partners ability to record, process, summarize and report
financial information and (ii) any fraud, whether or not material, that
involves management or other employees who have a significant role in RMT
Partners internal control over financial reporting.

 

Section 7.9 Litigation and Proceedings. (a) There are no Actions pending or,
to the knowledge of RMT Partner, threatened before or by any Governmental
Authority against RMT Partner or any RMT Partner Subsidiary that would
reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a RMT
Partner Material Adverse Effect and (b) there is no continuing Governmental
Order to which RMT Partner or any RMT Partner Subsidiary is a party or by
which any of them are bound that would reasonably be expected to have,
individually or in the aggregate, a RMT Partner Material Adverse Effect.

RMT Partner, oral, notice from any Governmental Authority asserting any
violation of or failure to comply with, or an investigation with respect to

Matters Agreement, (i) result in, cause the vesting, exercisability or
delivery of, or increase the amount or value of, any material payment, right
or other benefit becoming due to any current or former director or employee of
any of the RMT Partner Entities under any RMT Partner Benefit Plan or
otherwise, (ii) materially increase any benefits otherwise payable under any

hereby or thereby (either alone or in conjunction with any other event) would
result in the payment by RMT Partner or any of the RMT Partner Entities of any
amount that would, individually or in combination with any other such
payment, constitute an "excess parachute payment" within the meaning of
Section 280G(b)(1) of the Code or any equivalent applicable Law. No RMT
Partner Benefit Plan provides for the gross-up or reimbursement of Taxes under

such treatment, (ii) if required to be registered has been registered and has

From and after the date hereof and until the Second Merger occurs, each Party
shall use its reasonable best efforts to ensure that the Contribution, the

Merger qualify for the Intended Tax Treatment and shall not knowingly take any
action, cause or permit any action to be taken, fail to take any action or
cause any action to fail to be taken, which action or failure to act could

the Merger or the Second Merger from qualifying for the Intended Tax
Treatment.

 



98

    

(b) RMT Partner and Remainco shall cooperate and use their respective
reasonable best efforts in order for Remainco to obtain the opinion of

customary representations and assumptions set forth or referred to in such
opinion and the Tax Representation Letters (provided that RMT Partner shall
have a reasonable opportunity to review and comment on such Tax Representation
Letters, and that any such comments shall be considered in good faith), to

Merger and the Second Merger will qualify for the Intended Tax Treatment (such
opinion of Remaincos Tax Counsel, the " _Remainco Tax Opinion_ ").

RMT Partner nor any of its Subsidiaries shall engage in any material internal
reorganization or restructuring transaction in connection with or in
anticipation of the Merger without the prior written consent of Remainco (such
consent not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed) unless such
internal reorganizations or restructurings (i) are not reasonably expected to
result in material liabilities (including Taxes) to RMT Partner, Spinco or any
of their respective Subsidiaries, (ii) are not otherwise reasonably expected
to have a material adverse impact on the Tax liabilities or effective Tax rate
of Spinco or any of the Spinco Subsidiaries after the Merger or (iii) are in

Disclosure Schedule. Each of the Parties shall provide the other Parties (and
their Representatives) with a reasonable opportunity to review and comment on
the Securities Filings (or any amendment or supplement thereto) prior to the
filing of any such document with the SEC. None of the Securities Filings nor
any amendment or supplement thereto shall be filed or mailed to stockholders
without the written consent of all of the Parties (such consent not to be
unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned). For the avoidance of doubt,
any ordinary course communications filed pursuant to Rule 425 under
the Securities Act or any other disclosures or statements with respect to the
Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby and in the Transaction
Documents contained in any filing required under securities Laws, other than
the Securities Filings, shall be subject to _Section_ __ _ 8.21_.

(e) If at any time prior to the Effective Time any information relating to any
of the Parties, or any of their respective Affiliates, officers or directors,
should be discovered by such Party which should be set forth in an amendment
or supplement to any of the Securities Filings so that any of such documents
would not include any misstatement of a material fact or omit to state any
material fact necessary to make the statements therein, in the light of the
circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, the Party that
discovers such information shall promptly notify the other Parties and, to
the extent required by applicable Law, an appropriate amendment or supplement
describing such information shall be filed promptly with the SEC and

being referred to as the " _Debt Financing_ "), (ii) negotiate definitive
agreements with respect to the Debt Financing, on the terms and conditions
contained in the Spinco Commitment Letter or on such other terms as are

Financing, the " _Debt Financing Agreements_ ", and with respect to the
Permanent Financing, the " _Permanent Financing Agreements_ "; collectively,
the " _Financing Agreements_ "), (iii) materially comply with the obligations
that are set forth in the Spinco Commitment Letter and the Financing

debt financing and/or (y) commitments in respect of other long term debt from
the same and/or alternative bona fide third-party financing sources (any such
financing, the " _Permanent Financing_ " and, together with the Debt

(or more favorable to Spinco than) the conditions precedent set forth in the

consultation in good faith with RMT Partner, and, with respect to any
Alternative Financing (as defined below) that is in the form of the Permanent
Financing, at the direction of RMT Partner) shall arrange and obtain promptly
any such portion from the same or alternative sources, in an amount

and reasonable in light of then-prevailing market terms, (ii) none of Spinco,
RMT Partner or any of their respective Affiliates shall agree, or be required

other transactions contemplated hereby, would result in Spinco having a Below
Investment Grade Rating, (iii) the terms and conditions of the Alternative
Financing shall not be materially less favorable, taken as a whole, to Spinco
or RMT Partner than those in the Spinco Commitment Letter as in effect on the
date hereof and (iv) none of Spinco or any of its Affiliates shall agree
(without the consent of RMT Partner (such consent not to be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned or delayed)) to any Alternative Financing that would

106

    

(c) Each of Spinco and RMT Partner shall give the other Party prompt written
notice upon it obtaining knowledge of (i) any material breach (or threatened

rise to any material breach or default) by any party to the Spinco Commitment
Letter or the Permanent Financing Agreements, as applicable, (ii) any actual
or threatened withdrawal, repudiation or termination of the Financing by any
of the Financing Sources and (iii) any material dispute or disagreement

information pursuant to clauses (i), (ii) or (iii) that would waive the
protection of attorney-client or similar privilege if Spinco or RMT Partner
shall have used reasonable best efforts to disclose such information in a way
that would not waive such privilege. Neither Spinco nor RMT Partner shall,
without the prior written consent of the other Party, amend, modify,
supplement, restate, substitute, replace, terminate, or agree to any waiver
under the Spinco Commitment Letter or the Permanent Financing Agreements, as
applicable, in a manner that (i) reduces the aggregate amount of the Financing
such that the aggregate funds that would be available to Spinco on the date of
Distribution would not be sufficient to provide the funds required to satisfy
the Spinco Special Cash Payment, (ii) adds or expands on the conditions
precedent to the funding of the Financing as set forth in the Spinco
Commitment Letter as in effect on the date hereof or the Permanent Financing
Agreements, as applicable, in a manner that could materially delay or prevent
or make materially less likely the funding of the Financing on the date of
Distribution or (iii) materially adversely affects the ability of Spinco to
enforce its rights against the Spinco Lenders under the Spinco Commitment
Letter as in effect on the date hereof or against the Financing Sources with
respect to the Permanent Financing under the Permanent Financing Agreements,
as applicable; _provided_ that notwithstanding the foregoing, Spinco may (in
consultation with RMT Partner) (i) implement or exercise any of the "market
flex" provisions exercised by the Spinco Lenders in accordance with the
Spinco Commitment Letter as of the date hereof or any Permanent Financing
Commitment Letter or (ii) amend and restate the Spinco Commitment Letter or
any Permanent Financing Commitment Letter or otherwise execute joinder
agreements to the Spinco Commitment Letter solely to add additional Spinco
Lenders.

material furnished by any Party or its Representatives thereunder and
hereunder and that nothing in this _Section_ __ _ 8.8_ shall require Remainco
to provide access to any of its businesses or any information other than with
respect to the Spinco Business, and in no event shall Remainco be required to
provide any information relating to any Remainco Assets or any Remainco
Liabilities. The Confidentiality Agreement shall survive any termination of
this Agreement. In furtherance and not in limitation of the limitations set
forth in the Confidentiality Agreement, with respect thereto, RMT Partner
shall not, and shall cause its Representatives not to, contact any of the
employees, customers, distributors or suppliers of any Remainco Entity or
Spinco Entity in connection with, or for the purposes of, the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, whether in person or by telephone, mail, or
other means of communication, without the specific prior written authorization
of Remainco. All requests for such access to any Party shall be made to such
Party or its designated Representative.

Section 8.9 DandO Indemnification and Insurance.

 

(a) For a period of six (6) years from the Closing Date, RMT Partner agrees
that it shall cause the Spinco Entities to) indemnify and hold harmless each
present and former director and officer of any Spinco Entity (the "
_Indemnified Parties_ ") against any costs or expenses (including reasonable
attorneys fees), judgments, fines, Losses, claims, damages or liabilities
incurred in connection with any claim, action, suit, proceeding or
investigation arising out of or pertaining to matters existing or occurring at
or prior to the Closing (including those matters pertaining to this Agreement,
the Transaction Documents and the transactions contemplated hereby and
thereby), whether asserted or claimed prior to, at or after the Effective
Time, to the fullest extent that Remainco or any of its Subsidiaries
(including the Spinco Entities), as the case may be, would have been
permitted under Law and their respective Organizational Documents in effect on
the date hereof to indemnify such Person (including promptly advancing
expenses as incurred in accordance with and to the fullest extent permitted
under such Organizational Documents; provided that such Indemnified Party
agrees in advance to return any such funds to which a court of competent
jurisdiction has determined in a final, nonappealable judgment such
Indemnified Party is not ultimately entitled).

(b) RMT Partner shall cause the Spinco Entities to procure (i) prepaid, non-
cancelable six (6)-year "tail" insurance commencing on the Closing Date
containing terms no less favorable in the aggregate to the Indemnified Parties
(including as to coverage and amounts) than the terms of the directors and
officers liability insurance covering the Indemnified Parties who are, or at
any time prior to the Closing were, covered by the directors and officers
liability insurance of Remainco or any of its Subsidiaries (including the
Spinco Entities) with respect to matters existing or occurring at or prior to
the Effective Time (including those matters pertaining to this Agreement, the
Transaction Documents and the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby),
(ii) an endorsement under RMT Partners existing directors and officers
liability insurance to provide such coverage or (iii) separate directors and
officers liability insurance, with appropriate retroactive dates, providing
such coverage. Notwithstanding the foregoing, RMT Partner shall not be
required to pay annual premiums in excess of 250% of the last annual premium
paid by Remainco prior to the date hereof (the " _Premium Cap_ "), and if the
amount of the premium necessary to maintain such insurance described in this
_Section_ __ _ 8.9(b)_ would at any time exceed the Premium Cap, then RMT
Partner shall cause to be maintained policies of insurance coverage which
provide the maximum coverage available at an annual premium equal to the
Premium Cap. If any claim is asserted or made within such six (6)-year period,
then the insurance required to be maintained under this  _Section_ __ _ 8.9_
shall be continued in respect of such claim until the final disposition
thereof.

 



112

    

(c) Notwithstanding anything contained in this Agreement to the contrary,
this  _Section_ __ _ 8.9_ shall survive the consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby and shall be binding, jointly and severally, on all
successors and assigns of RMT Partner and Spinco and is intended to be for the
benefit of, and will be enforceable by, each present and former director and
officer of any Spinco Entity and his or her heirs and representatives. In the
event that RMT Partner or Spinco or any of their respective successors or
assigns consolidates with or merges into any other Person and shall not be
the continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation or
merger or transfers or conveys all or substantially all of its assets to any
Person, then, and in each such case, proper provision shall be made so that
the successors and assigns of RMT Partner and Spinco, as the case may be,
shall succeed to the obligations set forth in this _Section_ __ _ 8.9_.

 

Section 8.10 No Solicitation.

 

(a) Except as permitted by this _Section_ __ _ 8.10_, RMT Partner agrees
that, from and after the date hereof, it shall (i) immediately cease and
terminate, and cause its Subsidiaries and all of its and its Subsidiaries
respective Representatives to cease and terminate, any discussions or
negotiations with any other Person (other than Remainco or its Affiliates)
regarding any Competing Proposal, (ii) promptly request, or cause to be
requested, that each Person that has received confidential information within
the twelve (12) month period prior to the date hereof in connection with
a possible Competing Proposal return to RMT Partner or destroy all such
confidential information heretofore furnished to such Person by or on behalf
of RMT Partner or any of its Subsidiaries and promptly prohibit any access by
any Person (other than Remainco and its Representatives) to any physical or
electronic data room relating to a possible Competing Proposal and (iii) not
grant any waiver or release under or knowingly fail to enforce any
confidentiality, standstill or similar agreement in respect of a proposed
Competing Proposal, provided that, solely with respect to clause (iii), prior
to the time the RMT Partner Shareholder Approval is obtained, but not after,
RMT Partner may take any action described in clause (iii) to the extent (x)
necessary to permit a Person to make, on a confidential basis, a Competing
Proposal, conditioned upon such person agreeing to disclosure of such
Competing Proposal to Remainco, in each case as contemplated by this 
_Section_ __ _ 8.10_ and (y) the RMT Partner Board concludes in good faith
(after consultation with its outside financial advisor and outside legal
counsel) that a failure to take any action described in clause (iii) could be
inconsistent with the RMT Partner directors fiduciary duties to RMT Partners
shareholders under applicable Law. From and after the date hereof, except as
otherwise permitted by this _Section_ __ _ 8.10_, RMT Partner shall not,
directly or indirectly, nor shall RMT Partner authorize or permit its
Subsidiaries or authorize or knowingly permit its or their respective
Representatives to, directly or indirectly, (1) solicit, initiate or

(including by way of furnishing nonpublic information), or engage in, continue
or otherwise participate in discussions or negotiations regarding, any
inquiry, proposal or offer, or the making, submission or announcement of any
inquiry, proposal or offer (including any inquiry, proposal or offer to its
shareholders) which constitutes or would be reasonably expected to lead to a
Competing Proposal (except to notify such Person of the existence of the
provisions of this _Section_ __ _ 8.10_), (2) furnish any nonpublic or
confidential information or afford access to properties, books or records to
any Person in connection with or for the purpose of soliciting or knowingly
encouraging or facilitating a Competing Proposal, (3) take any action to make
the provisions of any "fair price," "moratorium," "control share acquisition,"
"business combination" or other similar anti-takeover statute or regulation
(including any transaction under, or a third party becoming an "interested
shareholder" under, Section 912 of the New York Business Corporation Law)
inapplicable to any person (other than Remainco and its Affiliates) or to any
transactions constituting or contemplated by a Competing Proposal, (4) approve
or recommend, or propose to approve or recommend, or execute or enter into any
letter of intent, memorandum of understanding, agreement in principle, merger
agreement, acquisition agreement, stock purchase agreement, asset purchase
agreement or stock exchange, option agreement, joint venture agreement,
partnership agreement or other similar agreement (whether written or oral,
binding or nonbinding) relating to a Competing Proposal or that would
reasonably be expected to lead to a Competing Proposal or that would require
RMT Partner to abandon or fail to consummate the Merger and the
other transactions contemplated by this Agreement (other than an Acceptable
Confidentiality Agreement entered into in accordance with _Section_ __ _
8.10(b)_) (a " _RMT Partner Acquisition Agreement_ "), or (5)
propose publicly or agree to do any of the foregoing. Without limiting the
generality of the foregoing, RMT Partner acknowledges and agrees that, in the
event any officer, director or financial advisor of RMT Partner takes any
action that if taken by RMT Partner would be a breach of this _Section_ __ _
8.10_, the taking of such action by such officer, director or financial
advisor shall be deemed to constitute a breach of this _Section_ __ _ 8.10_
by RMT Partner. In furtherance of its obligations hereunder, to the extent
that RMT Partner has knowledge that any Representative of RMT Partner has
taken an action that, if taken by the RMT Partner, would violate the
restrictions set forth in this  _Section_ __ _ 8.10_, then RMT Partner shall
promptly instruct such Representative to cease such action.



 



113

    

(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in the provisions of 
_Section_ __ _ 8.10(a)_ or any other provision of this Agreement, if an
unsolicited, _bona fide_ Competing Proposal is submitted in writing to RMT
Partner by a third Person or group after the date hereof, then prior to
(but not after) the occurrence of the RMT Partner Shareholder Approval, RMT
Partner may, directly or indirectly through its Representatives, (i) furnish
information and access to such Person or group and its Representatives (for so
long as such Competing Proposal has not been withdrawn) and (ii) participate
in discussions and negotiate with such Person concerning any such unsolicited
Competing Proposal, in the case of clauses (i) and (ii) if and only if, (A)
the submission of such Competing Proposal did not result from or arise in
connection with a material breach of this _Section_ __ _ 8.10_, (B) the RMT
Partner Board concludes, after consultation with its outside legal counsel
and financial advisors, that such Competing Proposal constitutes or would be
reasonably likely to constitute or result in a Superior Proposal, (C) RMT
Partner receives from the Person or group making such Competing Proposal an
executed Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement, and (D) the RMT Partner Board
determines in good faith (after consultation with its outside legal counsel
and financial advisors) that the failure to take such action could be
inconsistent with the RMT Partner directors fiduciary duties to RMT
Partners shareholders under applicable Law. Remainco shall be entitled to
receive an executed copy of any such Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement and
notification of the determination set forth in clause (B) above and the
identity of such Person promptly (and in any event within twenty-four (24)
hours) after the RMT Partner Board makes the determination in clause (B)
above. RMT Partner shall promptly provide or make available to Remainco any
information concerning RMT Partner and any of its Subsidiaries that is
provided to the Person or group making such Competing Proposal or its
Representatives which was not previously provided or made available to
Remainco.

 



114

    

(c) Except as expressly permitted by this _Section_ __ _ 8.10(c)_, the
RMT Partner Board shall make the RMT Partner Recommendation, and unless
permitted by this _Section_ __ _ 8.10(c)_, neither the RMT Partner Board nor
any committee thereof shall (i) (A) withhold, withdraw, modify or qualify,
or propose to withhold, withdraw, modify or qualify, in any manner adverse to
Remainco, Spinco or their respective Affiliates, the approval of this
Agreement or the RMT Partner Recommendation, (B) recommend, adopt or approve,
or propose publicly to recommend, adopt or approve, any Competing Proposal,
(C) refrain from recommending against (and re-affirming the RMT Partner
Recommendation) any Competing Proposal that is a tender offer or
exchange offer within ten (10) Business Days after the commencement thereof
or (D) resolve or publicly propose or agree to do any of the foregoing (any
action described in this clause (i) being referred to as a " _RMT Partner
Change in Recommendation_ ") or (ii) approve, endorse or recommend, or
propose publicly to approve, endorse or recommend, or allow RMT Partner or any
of its Subsidiaries to execute or enter into, a RMT Partner Acquisition
Agreement or (iii) resolve, agree or publicly propose to do any of the
foregoing. Notwithstanding the foregoing but subject to RMT Partners
compliance with the provisions of _Section_ __ _ 8.10(d)_, if the RMT Partner
Board has determined in good faith, after consultation with its outside legal
counsel and financial advisors, that a Competing Proposal made after the date
hereof that did not result from a material breach of any of the provisions of
this  _Section_ __ _ 8.10_ constitutes a Superior Proposal, the RMT Partner
Board may make a RMT Partner Change in Recommendation if all of the following
conditions are met: (x) the RMT Partner Shareholder Approval has not
been obtained; (y) (1) RMT Partner gives Remainco written notice (a "
_Superior Proposal Notice_ ") at least four (4) Business Days prior to taking
such action, which notice advises Remainco of the intention of the RMT
Partner Board to take such action, specifies the material terms and
conditions of such Competing Proposal, identifies the Person making such
Competing Proposal and includes a copy of the proposed RMT Partner Acquisition
Agreement (if any) for such Competing Proposal ( _provided_ that if there is
any material change, material amendment or material modification to the terms
or status of such Competing Proposal, RMT Partner will provide a subsequent
notice to Remainco of such changes, amendments or modifications and not take
any such action prior to the second (2nd) Business Day following a subsequent
notice to Remainco of such changes) (it being understood that there may be
multiple extensions of such notice period), (2) during a period of four (4)
Business Days following Remaincos receipt of a Superior Proposal Notice (or,
in the event of a new Superior Proposal Notice as a result of any such
amendment or modification, an extension of two (2) additional Business Days),
if requested by Remainco, RMT Partner and its Representatives shall have
negotiated with Remainco and its Representatives in good faith with respect to
any revisions or adjustments proposed by Remainco to the terms and conditions
of this Agreement; and (z) if applicable, at the end of such applicable four
(4)- or two (2)-Business Day period, the RMT Partner Board, after considering
in good faith any such revisions or adjustments to the terms and conditions of
this Agreement that Remainco, prior to the expiration of such applicable
period, shall have irrevocably offered in writing, continues to determine in
good faith (after consultation with its outside legal counsel and financial
advisors) that the Competing Proposal constitutes a Superior Proposal and
that failure to make such RMT Partner Change in Recommendation could be
inconsistent with the RMT Partner directors fiduciary duties to RMT Partners
shareholders under applicable Law.

 

(d) In furtherance and not in limitation of the foregoing, in the event RMT
Partner or its Representatives receives a Competing Proposal, any inquiry,
proposal or indication of interest that is or would reasonably be expected to
lead to a Competing Proposal, any request for nonpublic information relating
to RMT Partner or any of its Subsidiaries or for access to the properties,
books or records of RMT Partner or any of its Subsidiaries by any Person or
group that has made or, to the knowledge of RMT Partner, would reasonably be
expected to make a Competing Proposal, or any request for discussions or
negotiations in respect of any Competing Proposal, RMT Partner will (i) as
promptly as practicable (and in no event later than twenty-four (24) hours
after knowledge of receipt by RMT Partner or any of its Subsidiaries or any of
its or their Representatives of any such Competing Proposal, inquiry,
proposal, indication of interest or request) notify (which notice may be
provided orally and confirmed in writing and shall identify the Person or
group making such Competing Proposal, inquiry, proposal, indication
of interest or request and set forth the material terms thereof (including a
true, complete and un-redacted copy of such Competing Proposal if it is in
writing, if any)) Remainco thereof and (ii) keep Remainco reasonably and
promptly informed of the status and material terms of (including with respect
to changes to the status or material terms of) any such Competing Proposal,
inquiry, proposal, indication of interest or request. Without limiting the
generality of the preceding sentence, RMT Partner shall provide to Remainco as
promptly as practicable after receipt or delivery thereof (and in any event
within 24 hours of receipt or delivery) copies of all documentation comprising
such Competing Proposal or other documentation that is material to
understanding such Competing Proposal received by RMT Partner or any
Subsidiary of RMT Partner or any of its or their Representatives from the
Person or group making a Competing Proposal (or such Persons
Representatives) and of all material documentation provided by RMT Partner or
any Subsidiary of RMT Partner or its or their Representatives to the Person or
group making a Competing Proposal (or such Persons Representatives) that
comprises any counterproposal or any other material substantive response by
RMT Partner (to the extent such counterproposal or substantive response is
permitted under this _Section_ __ _ 8.10_) to the Person or group making
such Competing Proposal (or such Persons Representatives). RMT Partner shall
not, and shall cause its Subsidiaries not to, enter into any confidentiality
or other agreement with any Person subsequent to the date of this Agreement
that prohibits RMT Partner from providing such information to Remainco.

 



115

    

(e) Subject to Remaincos rights under _Article IX_ , nothing in this 
_Section_ __ _ 8.10_ shall prohibit the RMT Partner Board from taking and
disclosing to RMT Partners shareholders a position contemplated by Rule
14e-2(a), Rule 14d-9 (including any "stop, look and listen" communication
pursuant to Rule 14d-9(f)) or Item 1012(a) of Regulation M-A promulgated
under the Exchange Act, or other applicable Law; _provided_ , _however_ , that
no disclosure that would amount to a RMT Partner Change in Recommendation
shall be permitted, made or taken other than in accordance with  _Section_ __
_ 8.10(c)_.

For purposes of this Agreement:

 

(i) " _Competing Proposal_ " means, other than from Remainco or any of its
Subsidiaries, any inquiry, proposal or offer for, or indication of interest
from any Person with respect to, or that would reasonably be expected to lead

direct or indirect acquisition, exclusive license or purchase of any business
or assets of RMT Partner or any of its Subsidiaries that, individually or in
the aggregate, constitutes 15% or more of the net revenues, net income or
assets of RMT Partner and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, (B) direct or
indirect acquisition or purchase of 15% or more of any class of equity
securities, or Interests representing 15% or more of the outstanding voting

power, of RMT Partner, or (D) merger, consolidation, business combination,
share exchange, joint venture, partnership, recapitalization, liquidation,

(ii) " _Superior Proposal_ " means any _bona fide_ , written Competing
Proposal received after the date hereof that the RMT Partner Board determines
in good faith (after consultation with its outside financial advisor and
outside legal counsel) (x) is reasonably likely to be consummated
in accordance with its terms and (y) if consummated, would be more favorable
to the RMT Partners stockholders from a financial point of view than the
Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby, in each case taking
into account the financial (including the availability of financing and any
financing terms), legal, regulatory, timing, risk of consummation and other
aspects of such Competing Proposal (including the Person or group making the
Competing Proposal) and of this Agreement (including any changes to the terms
of this Agreement offered by Remainco in response to a Competing Proposal in
accordance with _Section_ __ _ 8.10_); _provided_ , however, that for
purposes of the definition of "Superior Proposal" references to "15%" in the
definition of "Competing Proposal" shall be deemed to be references to 50%.

 

(f) Remainco agrees that, from and after the date hereof, it shall (i)
immediately cease and terminate, and cause its Subsidiaries and all of its
and its Subsidiaries respective Representatives to cease and terminate, any
discussions or negotiations with any other Person (other than RMT Partner or

promptly request, or cause to be requested, that each Person that has
received confidential information within the twelve (12) month period prior to

or otherwise participate in discussions or negotiations regarding, any
inquiry, proposal or offer, or the making, submission or announcement of any
inquiry, proposal or offer (including any inquiry, proposal or offer to its
shareholders) which constitutes or would be reasonably expected to lead to a
Competing Spinco Proposal (except to notify such Person of the existence of
the provisions of this _Section_ __ _ 8.10_(f)), (2) furnish any nonpublic or
confidential information or afford access to properties, books or records to
any Person in connection with or for the purpose of soliciting or knowingly

reasonably be expected to lead to a Competing Spinco Proposal or that would
require Remainco or Spinco to abandon or fail to consummate the Merger and the
other transactions contemplated by this Agreement or (4) propose publicly or
agree to do any of the foregoing. Without limiting the generality of the
foregoing, Remainco acknowledges and agrees that, in the event any officer,
director or financial advisor of Remainco takes any action that if taken by

such action by such officer, director or financial advisor shall be deemed to
constitute a breach of this  _Section_ __ _ 8.10_(f) by Remainco. In
furtherance of its obligations hereunder, to the extent that Remainco has
knowledge that any Representative of Remainco has taken an action that, if
taken by Remainco, would violate the restrictions set forth in this _Section_
__ _ 8.10_(f), then Remainco shall promptly instruct such Representative to
cease such action.

Organizational Documents or (b) any "fair price," "moratorium," "business
combination," or "control share acquisition" statute or other similar statute
or regulation is or shall become applicable to the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement, RMT Partner and the RMT Partner Board and/or Spinco and the
Spinco Board shall use reasonable best efforts to grant such approvals and
take such actions as are necessary so that the transactions contemplated
hereby may be consummated as promptly as practicable on the terms contemplated
hereby and shall otherwise act to minimize the effects of any such
restriction, statute or regulation on the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement.

Section 8.20 Further Actions.

 

(a) Except as otherwise expressly provided in this Agreement, the Parties
shall, and shall cause their respective Affiliates to, use their respective
commercially reasonable efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all appropriate
action, to do, or cause to be done, and to assist and cooperate with the other
Parties in doing, all things necessary, proper or advisable under this
Agreement or applicable Law as may be required to carry out the provisions of
this Agreement and to consummate and make effective the Merger and the other
transactions contemplated hereby and by the Transaction Documents (other than
with respect to the matters covered in _Section_ __ _ 8.6_, which shall be
governed by the provisions of _Section_ __ _ 8.6_ and any Consents required
in connection with the Separation, which shall solely be governed by
the Separation and Distribution Agreement). In furtherance and not in
limitation of the foregoing, each Party shall use commercially reasonable
efforts to obtain all consents, approvals or waivers from third parties
necessary in connection with the Merger (other than with respect to the
matters covered in _Section_ __ _ 8.6_, which shall be governed by the
provisions of _Section_ __ _ 8.6_ and any Consents required in connection
with the Separation, which shall solely be governed by the Separation and
Distribution Agreement); _provided_ that, none of RMT Partner, Remainco or
Spinco or any of their respective Affiliates shall be required to commence any
litigation or offer or pay any money or otherwise grant any accommodation
(financial or otherwise) to any third party with respect to the foregoing. The
failure to obtain any consents, approvals or waivers from third parties shall
not in and of itself constitute a breach of this Agreement; _provided_ that
the foregoing shall not preclude consideration of a Partys efforts in
pursuing such consent, approval or waiver for purposes of determining
compliance with this _Section_ __ _ 8.20_.

 

(b) The Parties agree that, with respect to certain matters relating to the
Corteva Letter Agreement and PFAS Substances set forth on Schedule 8.20(b) of
the Spinco Disclosure Schedule, the procedures and agreements set forth on
Schedule 8.20(b) of the Spinco Disclosure Schedule shall govern.

 

Section 8.21 Public Announcements. From and after the date hereof until the
Closing, Remainco and RMT Partner shall consult in good faith with each other
before issuing any press release, having any communication with the press or
making any other public statement (including any press conference or
conference call with investors or analysts) with respect to the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement or the other Transaction Documents, and shall
not issue any such press release, have such communication or make any such
public statement prior to such consultation (to the extent not previously
issued or made in accordance with this Agreement), except in each case (i) as
either Remainco or RMT Partner may reasonably determine is required by
applicable Law or Governmental Order or any listing arrangement with or rule
of the NYSE or other applicable stock exchange, (ii) where such press release
or other public statements are consistent with previous press releases, public
disclosures or public statements issued or made in accordance with this
Agreement (including any filings with the SEC), (iii) for any such press
release, communication with the press or other public statement by RMT Partner
with respect to any RMT Partner Change in Recommendation made in accordance
with this Agreement, any Competing Proposal or as otherwise permitted by
_Section_ __ _ 8.10_ or (iv) as provided in the French Offer Letter. In
furtherance and not in limitation of the foregoing, to the extent applicable,
as part of any consultation between the Parties (solely to the extent such
consultation is required), a draft of such press release, communication or
public statement shall be shared and any comments provided shall be considered
in good faith.

Section 8.22 Financial Information.

 

(a) Remainco shall engage its auditors to perform an audit of the financial
statements of (x) the Spinco Business and (y) to the extent required by
applicable Law, Spinco (before giving effect to the Separation). Remainco will
provide RMT Partner with the audited combined and consolidated financial
statements of (i) the Spinco Business and (ii) to the extent required by
applicable Law, Spinco (before giving effect to the Separation) (except that
for Spinco, only an opening balance sheet shall be required), including the
combined and consolidated balance sheets of (1) the Spinco Business and (2)
to the extent required by applicable Law, Spinco (before giving effect to the
Separation) as of the Required Periods, and the combined and consolidated
statements of earnings, cash flows and parent equity of (A) the Spinco
Business and (B) to the extent required by applicable Law, Spinco (before
giving effect to the Separation) for the years ended of the Required Periods,
together with an audit report, without qualification or exception thereto, on
the financial statements from the independent accountants for the Spinco
Business and Spinco (collectively, the " _Audited Financial Statements_ ") (it
being understood, however, that the Spinco Business has not been operating
historically as a separate "standalone" entity and, therefore, the Audited
Financial Statements will reflect certain cost and other allocations made that
may not reflect what would have been incurred if the Spinco Business had been
a standalone business). Remainco shall deliver the Audited Financial
Statements prepared on a GAAP basis as promptly as reasonably practicable
after the date hereof (it being acknowledged that Remainco intends to deliver
such Audited Financial Statements in accordance with the targeted timeline
outlined in Section 8.22(a) of the Spinco Disclosure Schedule). Remainco will,
as promptly as practicable, procure, at its expense, the delivery of the
consents of the independent accountants required to be filed with the
RMT Partner Registration Statement.

(b) Remainco shall, from the date hereof until the Closing Date, deliver to
RMT Partner, (i) as promptly as reasonably practicable after the end of any
fiscal quarter (other than any fourth fiscal quarter) ending after the date
hereof copies of the unaudited combined balance sheet of the Spinco Business
as of the Required Periods and the related unaudited combined statements of
income, comprehensive income, equity and cash flows of the Spinco Business for
the Required Periods, together with comparable financial statements for the
corresponding periods of the prior fiscal year, in each case, to the extent
required to be included or incorporated by reference in the Securities Filings
(collectively, the " _Subsequent Unaudited Spinco Financial Statements_ "),
which Subsequent Unaudited Spinco Financial Statements shall have been
reviewed by the independent accountant for Spinco in accordance with the
procedures specified by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United
States) in AS 4105, _Reviews of Interim Financial Information_ , and (i)
following the delivery of the Audited Financial Statements and for periods
subsequent thereto, as promptly as reasonably practicable after the end of
each fiscal year, copies of (1) the audited combined balance sheet of the
Spinco Business as of the end of each fiscal year of Spinco and the related
audited combined statements of income, comprehensive income, equity and cash
flows of the Spinco Business for such fiscal year, together with comparable
financial statements for the prior fiscal year, in each case, to the extent
required to be included or incorporated by reference in the Securities Filings
and subject to the requirements thereof and Spincos determination of its
fiscal year as permitted in accordance therewith (collectively, the "
_Subsequent Audited Spinco Financial Statements_ ") and (2) an audit report,
without qualification or exception thereto, on each of the Subsequent Audited
Spinco Financial Statements from the independent accountant for Spinco.

 



122

    

(c) In connection with the filing of the Securities Filings, as well as the
Financing, Remainco shall use its commercially reasonable efforts prior to
and after the Closing to (i) cooperate with RMT Partner in connection with RMT
Partners preparation of pro forma financial statements that comply with the
rules and regulations of the SEC to the extent required for the Securities
Filings, including the requirements of Regulation S-X, and for the twelve (12)
month period ending on the last day of the most recently completed four
fiscal quarter period for which financial statements have been delivered
pursuant to this Section 8.22, and (ii) provide and make reasonably available
upon reasonable notice and during regular business hours the
appropriate senior management employees of Remainco to discuss the materials
prepared and delivered pursuant to this Section 8.22(c).

(d) The obligations of Remainco and Spinco in this Agreement to provide
certain financial statements and financial information for inclusion in the
Securities Filings shall at all times be subject to the requirements of
applicable Law. The requirements of applicable Law shall at all times be
determined by reference to applicable Law as modified by Section 8.22 of the
Spinco Disclosure Schedule, and no action taken by Remainco in accordance with
Section 8.22 of the Spinco Disclosure Schedule shall be considered
inconsistent with or violative of applicable Law or any of Remainco and
Spincos obligations with respect to the Securities Filings, in each case,
under the terms of this Agreement. To the extent that, after the date of
this Agreement, any Governmental Authority, after consultation with Remainco,
determines any item set forth in Section 8.22 of the Spinco Disclosure
Schedule is not permitted by applicable Law, Section 8.22 of the Spinco
Disclosure Schedule shall be deemed modified to remove or modify such item so
as to be consistent with the determination of such Governmental Authority, and
no previous action by Remainco or Spinco in connection with the former item
shall be considered to be a breach of any of their obligations under this
Agreement.

Section 8.23 French Works Council.

 

(a) The Parties acknowledge that, under French labor laws, one or more works
councils of Remainco and/or one or more of its Subsidiaries that own French
Spinco Assets or directly conduct the French Spinco Business will need to be
informed and consulted with respect to the offer made by Spinco to acquire the
French Spinco Assets and the French Spinco Business and assume the French
Spinco Liabilities (each as defined in the Separation and Distribution
Agreement) and that Spinco has made an irrevocable offer, as more fully in
described in the offer letter attached to the Separation and Distribution
Agreement (and subject to the conditions set forth therein) to acquire the
French Spinco Assets and French Spinco Business and assume the French Spinco
Liabilities.

 



123

    

(b) If the consummation of the acquisition of the French Spinco Assets and
French Spinco Business and assumption of the French Spinco Liabilities is
unable to occur concurrently with or prior to the Separation, the Distribution
or the Closing in connection with obligations under the French labor laws, (a
" _Delayed French Closing_ "), the failure of the French Spinco Assets or
French Spinco Business to be acquired by Spinco prior to such times or of the
French Spinco Liabilities to be assumed by Spinco prior to such times shall
not give rise to any failure of the conditions in _Article IX_ of this
Agreement. If the conditions of _Article IX_ of this Agreement are otherwise
satisfied Closing shall proceed in accordance with the terms of this Agreement
notwithstanding any Delayed French Closing. Remainco and RMT Partner
acknowledge and agree that the conditions to the transfer of the French Spinco
Assets and French Spinco Business and assumption of the French Spinco
Liabilities set forth in the French Offer Letter from Spinco (i) may be
satisfied after the conditions to the Internal Reorganization and the
Distribution contained in the Separation and Distribution Agreement, and the
conditions set forth in _Article IX_ of this Agreement, are satisfied and (ii)
are the only conditions applicable to the transfer of the French Spinco
Assets and French Spinco Business and assumption of the French Spinco
Liabilities. A Delayed French Closing shall not result in any change to the
consideration payable pursuant to the terms of this Agreement. In the event
of any Delayed French Closing, the provisions of _Article VIII_ applicable to
the French Spinco Business that would otherwise have terminated as of the
Effective Time pursuant to  _Section_ __ _ 11.3_ shall continue in full
force and effect solely with respect to the French Spinco Business until the
earlier of the (x) the Delayed French Closing or (y) the rejection of the
irrevocable offer made by Spinco with respect to the French Spinco Business
as set forth in the French Offer Letter; _provided_ that, for the avoidance
doubt, under no circumstances will any failure to comply with _Article VIII_
hereof with respect to the French Spinco Business following the Closing have
any effect on the earlier Closing hereunder and upon occurrence of the Delayed
French Closing _Section_ __ _ 11.3_ shall be deemed to apply with respect to
_Article VIII_ as it relates to the French Spinco Business as if the
"Effective Time" was the date of the Delayed French Closing.

(c) Notwithstanding the fact that, as set forth in _Section_ __ _ 2.14_ of
the Separation and Distribution Agreement, unless and until Remainco (or its
relevant Subsidiaries) has executed and delivered to Spinco the France
Acceptance Notice (as defined in the Separation and Distribution Agreement),
the French Spinco Assets, the French Spinco Business and the French Spinco
Liabilities will not be considered to constitute part of the Spinco Assets,
Spinco Business or Spinco Liabilities respectively under the Separation and
Distribution Agreement, the French Spinco Assets, the French Spinco Business
and the French Spinco Liabilities shall be considered, at all times, part of
the Spinco Assets, Spinco Business and Spinco Liabilities as such terms are
used in this Agreement (including in _Article VI_ and _Article VIII_ hereof).

 

Section 8.24 Disclosure Schedules. Remainco and Spinco may update, amend,
modify or make additions to  _Sections_ _6.2_ and _6.7_ of the Spinco
Disclosure Schedule to reflect any necessary changes to such Section as a
result of any update, modification or supplement to the Separation Plan made
in accordance with the Separation and Distribution Agreement. Any such
updates, amendments, modifications or additions to the Spinco Disclosure
Schedule shall be deemed to have cured any inaccuracy in or breach of any
representation or warranty made in this Agreement.

 



124

    

Section 8.25 Notice of Certain Matters. Subject to applicable Law, each Party
shall give prompt notice to the other Party of (a) the occurrence or non-
occurrence of any event that has resulted or would reasonably be expected to
result in any condition set forth in _Section_ __ _ 9.2_ or _Section_ __ _
9.3_ not being satisfied, and (b) any notice or other communication received
from any Governmental Authority in connection with this Agreement, the Merger
or the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement, or from any Person
alleging that the consent of such Person is or may be required in connection
with the Merger or the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement or
the Transaction Documents, if the subject matter of such notice or other
communication or the failure of such party to obtain such consent would
reasonably be expected to impair in any material respect the ability of either
Party to perform its obligations under this Agreement or materially impede or
materially delay the consummation of the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated hereby (provided that any breach of this _Section_ __ _ 8.25_
shall not be deemed to constitute the failure of any condition set forth in
_Section_ __ _ 9.2(a)_ or _Section_ __ _ 9.3(a)_, in each case, unless the
underlying Effect would independently result in a failure of the conditions
set forth in  _Section_ __ _ 9.2(a)_ or _Section_ __ _ 9.3(a)_).
Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, no such
notification shall, in and of itself, affect the representations, warranties,
covenants or agreements of the Parties or the conditions to the obligations
of the parties hereunder.

Section 8.26 Completion of Other Transaction Documents.

(a) If, within forty-five (45) Business Days following delivery of the
Audited Financial Statements (the " _Target Completion Date_ "), Spinco or
RMT Partner identifies any service that is or was provided to the Spinco
Business by Remainco or any of its Subsidiaries at any time during the period
commencing twelve (12) months prior to the date hereof until the Target
Completion Date (the " _Services Period_ ") (other than any service provided
by Dow or Corteva, or an assignee of Dow or Corteva, whether provided prior
to, on or after, the "Effective Time" as such term is defined in the DWDP
SDA), either directly or indirectly through third-party service providers,
which service (i) Remainco or its Subsidiaries continue to provide to the
Spinco Business with respect to any operations, businesses or divisions of
the Remainco Group and (ii) Spinco or RMT Partner reasonably believes is
necessary for the operation or conduct of the Spinco Business following the
Closing in substantially the same manner as the Spinco Business was operated
or conducted during the Services Period (such service, a " _Remainco Provided
Eligible Service_ "), then promptly following a written notice from Spinco or
RMT Partner to Remainco to such effect, which written notice shall describe
such Remainco Provided Eligible Service, the Parties shall promptly provide
for such Remainco Provided Eligible Service to be included in the services
schedule on Exhibit A to the Transition Services Agreement pursuant to which
Remainco will provide services to Spinco and its Subsidiaries (the " _Remainco
Provider TSA_ ") such that Remainco or its Subsidiaries will provide (or
arrange for the provision of) such Remainco Provided Eligible Service
to Spinco and its Subsidiaries in accordance with the terms of the Remainco
Provider TSA and the parties shall negotiate in good faith to enter into a
service level agreement (" _SLA_ ") in connection with such Remainco Provided
Eligible Service, on terms not inconsistent with those in the Remainco
Provider TSA as a whole; provided, that no service listed on Exhibit C to the
Form of Transition Services Agreement as an "Intentionally Omitted Service" or
related to the excluded items set forth in Section 6.28 of the Spinco
Disclosure Schedule shall be deemed a Remainco Provided Eligible Service;
_provided_ , _further_ , that, if RMT Partner believes in good faith that
Spinco will not be in a reasonable position to procure or provide such
service itself, including through RMT Partner, by the Closing Date, RMT
Partner shall deliver notice to the Separation Committee (as defined in the
Separation and Distribution Agreement) and the Separation Committee shall
discuss and consider in good faith the provision and implementation of such
Intentionally Omitted Service for the benefit of RMT Partner and/or Spinco.

 



125

    

(b) If, prior to the Target Completion Date, Remainco identifies any service
that is or was provided to the Remainco Business by Spinco or any of its
Subsidiaries at any time during the Services Period, either directly or
indirectly through third-party service providers, which service (i) Spinco or
its Subsidiaries continue to provide to the Remainco Business with respect to
any operations, businesses or divisions of the Spinco Group and (ii) Remainco
reasonably believes is necessary for the operation or conduct of the Remainco
Business following the Closing in substantially the same manner as the
Remainco Business was operated or conducted during the Services Period (such
service, a " _Spinco Provided Eligible Service_ "), then promptly following a
written notice from Remainco to Spinco and RMT Partner to such effect, which
written notice shall describe such Spinco Provided Eligible Service, the
Parties shall promptly provide for such Spinco Provided Eligible Service to be
included in the services schedule on Exhibit A to the Transition
Services Agreement pursuant to which Spinco will provide services to Remainco
(the " _Spinco Provider TSA_ ") such that Spinco or its Subsidiaries will
provide (or arrange for the provision of) such Spinco Provided Eligible
Service to Remainco and its Subsidiaries in accordance with the terms of the
Spinco Provider TSA and the parties shall negotiate in good faith to enter
into an SLA in connection with such Spinco Provided Eligible Service on terms
not inconsistent with those in the Spinco Provider TSA as a whole.

(c) The SLAs described in _Section_ __ _ 8.26(a)_ and  _Section_ __ _
8.26(b)_ shall be in the form of Exhibit B to the Form of Transition Services
Agreement, shall be attached as Exhibit B to the applicable Transition
Services Agreement, and shall describe in reasonable detail the nature,
scope, service period(s), service fees, and other terms applicable to such
service. The compensation associated with any such service shall be determined
in accordance with the terms set forth in the Form of Transition Services
Agreement. 

(d) Each of the Parties shall use reasonable best efforts and shall cooperate
in good faith to (i) identify and agree upon any Remainco Provided Eligible
Services and Spinco Provided Eligible Services to be listed on Exhibit A to
the Remainco Provider TSA and the Spinco Provider TSA, as applicable, (ii)
negotiate in good faith and agree upon the terms of such service listed on
Exhibit A to the Remainco Provider TSA or Spinco Provider TSA, and any related
SLA, in each case to the Remainco Provider TSA or the Spinco Provider TSA in
respect of any agreed upon Remainco Provided Eligible Services and Spinco
Provided Eligible Services, and (iii) finalize the Remainco Provider TSA and
the Spinco Provider TSA (noting that, other than such exhibits as described in
clause (i) and (ii) hereof, the terms of the Remainco Provider TSA and the
Spinco Provider TSA shall be those set forth in the Form of Transition
Services Agreement other than the necessary adjustment of names to reflect the
providing and receiving parties and any other changes mutually agreed by the
Parties), in each case, prior to the Target Completion Date. Each of the
Parties shall use reasonable best efforts and shall cooperate in good faith to
cause the execution and delivery of the Remainco Provider TSA and the Spinco
Provider TSA, to the extent applicable, on or prior to the Closing Date.

 



126

    

(e) If Exhibit A and the related SLAs on Exhibit B of either of the Remainco
Provider TSA or the Spinco Provider TSA are not finalized and mutually agreed
by the Parties by the Target Completion Date, the finalization of such terms
(including whether any requested service is in fact a Remainco Provided
Eligible Service or a Spinco Provided Eligible Service) shall be escalated to
appropriate senior executive officers of each of Remainco and RMT Partner for
resolution.

(f) If the services to be included on and relevant terms of Exhibit A and the
related SLAs on Exhibit B of either of the Remainco Provider TSA or the Spinco
Provider TSA are not finalized and mutually agreed by the Parties within
thirty (30) days after the Target Completion Date, each of Remainco and RMT
Partner shall, within fifty (50) days after the Target Completion Date, select
one arbitrator to resolve any remaining disputed terms (which arbitrator need
not be neutral and independent of such appointing party, but shall not be a
current or former director, officer or employee of such party). If any party
fails to appoint an arbitrator within ten (10) days thereafter, such
arbitrator shall, at any partys request, be appointed by the American
Arbitration Association (the " _AAA_ "). The two arbitrators so selected shall
select a third arbitrator, who will chair the arbitral tribunal. If the two
party-appointed arbitrators fail to mutually agree upon the selection of the
chair within ten (10) days of the appointment of the second of these party-
appointed arbitrators, then, within fifteen (15) days of the appointment of
the second of these party-appointed arbitrators, the two party-appointed
arbitrators will agree upon and submit to the AAA a list of no less than three
and no more than five candidates to chair the panel, and the AAA will select
an arbitrator from such list to chair the arbitral tribunal. If the two
party-appointed arbitrators fail to submit a list to the AAA within the time
period specified herein, or if they otherwise fail to appoint a chair within
the time period specified herein, then the chair shall, at any partys
request, be appointed by the AAA. The chair will be neutral and independent of
each party. The seat of the arbitration will be New York, New York.

 

(g) Within 15 days of the constitution of the arbitral tribunal in accordance
with _Section_ __ _ 8.26(f)_, Remainco and RMT Partner will (i) jointly
submit to the arbitrators a list of services the provision of which is in
dispute (the " _Disputed Services List_ ") and (ii) with respect to any
services where either the provision of such service is in dispute or where
the provision of such service is agreed but the terms thereof are in dispute,
each of Remainco and RMT Partner shall submit the proposed terms for the
provision of such service in the form of which they would be appended to
the applicable Transition Services Agreement (with such proposed terms at all
times developed in accordance with the terms and conditions of the Form of
Transition Services Agreement). Each of Remainco and RMT Partner may provide a
written briefing accompanying their submission of no more than 1 pages per
service. The arbitral tribunal will also hold a telephonic or in-person one-
day hearing promptly after submission of such materials. The arbitral
tribunal shall within 15 days of the hearing render a decision (A) setting
forth which services from the Disputed Services List will be provided and (B)
to the extent a service is to be provided (whether by decision of the
arbitrators or prior agreement of the Parties), selecting either the terms of
a service submitted by Remainco or submitted by RMT Partner, in each case to
reflect the final SLA to be attached to Exhibit B of the Remainco Provider
TSA or the Spinco Provider TSA, as applicable, and with such agreements to
constitute the final versions to be executed by the parties thereto at or
prior to the Spinco Distribution. The decision of the arbitral tribunal, which
shall be governed by the Federal Arbitration Act, 9 U.S.C. § 1 et seq., shall
be final and binding upon the Parties to the fullest extent permitted by
applicable law and may be enforced in any court having jurisdiction. The
Parties will execute the Remainco Provider TSA and Spinco Provider TSA, as
applicable, reflecting the decision of the arbitral tribunal, as promptly as
practicable following the arbitral tribunals rendering of the decision, but
in no event later than the Spinco Distribution.

 



127

    

(h) The arbitral tribunal agrees to (and the parties agree to cause the
arbitral tribunal to) abide by the provisions of this _Section_ __ _ 8.26_.
The arbitral tribunal shall render its decision based on (x) with respect to
whether any service is to be provided, the criteria defining a Remainco
Provided Eligible Service and a Spinco Eligible Service in _Section_ __ _
8.26(a)_ and _Section_ __ _ 8.26(b)_ above and whether such service is indeed
eligible for provision in accordance with such criteria and (y) with respect
to the terms of any service included in the relevant SLA, primarily on the
terms and conditions of the Form of Transition Services Agreement and
secondarily on the basis of what is reasonable and customary for services of
the type in dispute and in transactions of this kind. The arbitral tribunal
shall apply the substantive law of the State of Delaware.

Section 8.27 Certain Other Ancillary Agreements.

(a) Promptly following execution of this Agreement, Remainco, Spinco and RMT
Partner will prepare initial drafts of the definitive Ancillary Agreements,
including those set forth on Section 8.27(a) of the Spinco Disclosure
Schedule, on terms that are customary for agreements of this nature. Remainco
agrees to, and shall cause Spinco to, and RMT Partner agrees to, and shall
cause its Subsidiaries to, execute any such Ancillary Agreement on the terms
mutually agreed by Remainco, Spinco and RMT Partner, acting reasonably and in
good faith, or on the terms finally decided pursuant to an arbitration
proceeding in accordance with this _Section_ __ _ 8.27_.

(b) Remainco, Spinco and RMT Partner shall use reasonable best efforts and
shall cooperate in good faith to finalize the terms of the Ancillary
Agreements within one hundred fifty (150) days of the date hereof.

 

(c) If the terms of any Ancillary Agreement are not finalized and mutually
agreed with RMT Partner within one hundred fifty (150) days of the date
hereof, the finalization of such terms shall be escalated to appropriate
senior executive officers of each of Remainco and RMT Partner for resolution.

 

(d) If the terms of the Ancillary Agreement are not finalized and mutually
agreed with RMT Partner within one hundred eighty (180) days of the date
hereof, Remainco and RMT Partner shall, within two hundred ten (210) days of
the date hereof, select one arbitrator to resolve any remaining disputed terms
(which arbitrator need not be neutral and independent of such appointing
party, but shall not be a current or former director, officer or employee of
such party). If any party fails to appoint an arbitrator within ten (10) days
thereafter, such arbitrator shall, at any partys request, be appointed by the
AAA. The two arbitrators so selected shall select a third arbitrator, who
will chair the arbitral tribunal. If the two party-appointed arbitrators fail
to mutually agree upon the selection of the chair within ten (10) days of the
appointment of the second of these party-appointed arbitrators, then, within
fifteen (15) days of the appointment of the second of these party-appointed
arbitrators, the two party-appointed arbitrators will agree upon and submit to
the AAA a list of no less than three (3) and no more than five (5) candidates
to chair the panel, and the AAA will select an arbitrator from such list to
chair the arbitral tribunal. If the two party-appointed arbitrators fail to
submit a list to the AAA within the time period specified herein, or if they
otherwise fail to appoint a chair within the time period specified herein,
then the chair shall, at any partys request, be appointed by the AAA. The
chair will be neutral and independent of each party. The seat of the
arbitration will be New York, New York.

 



128

    

(e) Within fifteen (15) days of the selection of an arbitration panel in
accordance with _Section_ __ _ 8.27(d),_ Remainco and RMT Partner will
submit to the arbitrators the most recent drafts of any Ancillary Agreement
which is not finalized at such time, reflecting the status of the parties
negotiations and a list of open issues and written descriptions of each
partys position with respect to each open issue. The arbitrators will also
hold a telephone or in-person one-day hearing promptly after submission of
such materials. The arbitrators shall within 15 days of the receipt of such
material render a decision with respect to each point of disagreement between
the parties. Such decision will be binding and nonappealable and sufficiently
clear to allow the parties to draft the disputed provisions of the applicable
agreement. Remainco agrees to, and shall cause Spinco to, and RMT Partner
agrees to, and shall cause its Subsidiaries to, finalize any remaining terms
and execute the applicable Ancillary Agreement as promptly as practicable
following the arbitrators decision but in no event later than the Separation.
The arbitral tribunal shall apply the substantive law of the State of
Delaware.

(f) Each arbitrator will render his or her decision based primarily on the
terms and principles set forth in the this Agreement and the Separation and
Distribution Agreement and secondarily on customary provisions for agreements
of this nature.

 

(g) If the applicable parties are unable to reach agreement on any Ancillary
Agreement, or any schedules thereto, such that a definitive agreement is not
executed and delivered at the time of the Closing, the Closing shall not be
delayed and the accuracy of the representations and warranties set forth in
_Section_ __ _ 6.28_ of this Agreement, for purposes of the fulfillment of
the closing conditions set forth in _Section_ __ _ 9.3_ of this Agreement,
shall in no event be affected by any failure to execute any Ancillary
Agreement. The Parties shall continue to use reasonable best efforts
to execute and deliver any definitive agreement that was not executed at or
prior to the Closing to the extent identified by either party prior to the
Closing, which, for the avoidance of doubt, shall utilize the dispute
resolution provision set forth in _Section_ __ _ 8.27(d)_ and _Section_ __ _
8.27(e)_.

transactions contemplated hereby may be abandoned at any time prior to the
Closing Date, whether before or after the RMT Partner Shareholder Approval:

(a) by mutual written agreement of Remainco and RMT Partner;

(b) by Remainco or RMT Partner, if any final and non-appealable Legal
Restraint is in effect which permanently prohibits, enjoins, restrains or
otherwise makes illegal the consummation of the Merger; _provided_ that the
right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 10.1(b)_
shall not be available to any Party whose action or failure to perform any of
its obligations under this Agreement proximately contributed to the enactment
or issuance of any such Law;

 

(c) by Remainco or RMT Partner, if the Closing shall not have occurred on or
prior to March 15, 2021 (the " _Initial Outside Date_ "); _provided_ ,
_however_ , that the right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this
_Section_ __ _ 10.1(c)_ shall not be available to any Party whose action or
failure to comply with its obligations under this Agreement or the
Transaction Documents has proximately contributed to the failure of the
Closing to occur on or prior to such date; _provided_ _,_ _further_ , that (x)
if on the Initial Outside Date one or both of the conditions to Closing set
forth in _Section_ __ _ 9.1(a)_ or _Section_ __ _ 9.1(g)_ (but for purposes
of _Section_ __ _ 9.1(g)_ only if failure to fulfill such condition is
attributable to a Competition Law) shall not have been fulfilled but all
other conditions to Closing set forth in _Article IX_ shall have been
satisfied or waived, as applicable (except for the conditions set forth in
_Section_ __ _ 9.1(b)_ and  _Section_ __ _ 9.1(c)_ and those conditions
which by their nature are to be satisfied at the Closing; _provided_ that such
conditions shall then be capable of being satisfied if the Closing were to
take place on such date), then the Initial Outside Date shall automatically
be extended to June 15, 2021(the " _Extended Outside Date_ "). As used in this
Agreement, the term " _Outside Date_ " shall mean the Initial Outside Date,
unless the Initial Outside Date has been extended pursuant to the foregoing
proviso, in which case, the term " _Outside Date_ " shall mean the date to
which the Outside Date has been extended;

 

(d) by RMT Partner, upon written notice to Remainco, in the event of a breach
of any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement on the part of
Remainco or any of its Subsidiaries, such that the conditions set forth in
_Section_ __ _ 9.3_ would not be capable of being satisfied, and which breach
is not cured by Remainco or its Subsidiaries by the date that is sixty (60)
days following delivery of written notice by RMT Partner to Remainco;
_provided_ , _however_ , that RMT Partner shall not be permitted to terminate
this Agreement pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 10.1(d)_ at any time prior to
the Initial Outside Date (and, at such time, only if such breach remains
uncured as of such date) if, prior to the date that is sixty (60) days
following RMT Partners delivery of such written notice, Remainco shall
have delivered to RMT Partner a certificate signed by a senior officer of
Remainco certifying that Remainco has determined in good faith (after
consultation with its outside legal counsel) that such breach is reasonably
expected to be cured prior to the Initial Outside Date;

 



133

    

(e) by Remainco, upon written notice to RMT Partner, in the event of a breach
of any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement contained in this
Agreement on the part of any of the RMT Partner Entities, such that the
conditions specified in _Section_ __ _ 9.2_ would not be capable of being
satisfied, and which breach is not cured by the date that is sixty (60) days
following the delivery of written notice by Remainco to RMT Partner;
_provided_ , _however_ that if Remainco shall have delivered an officers
certificate pursuant to  _Section_ __ _ 10.1(d)_, then Remainco shall not be
permitted to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this _Section_ __ _
10.1(e)_ at any time prior to the earlier of (i) the Business Day occurring
two (2) Business Days after the Initial Outside Date and (ii) the date

Partner Shareholders Meeting pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 8.5(b)_); _provided_
that the right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this  _Section_ __ _
10.1(f)_ shall not be available to RMT Partner if any action or failure to
perform any of its obligations under this Agreement is the primary cause of,
or primarily resulted in, the failure to obtain the RMT Partner Shareholder
Approval;

(g) by Remainco, prior to receipt of the RMT Partner Shareholder Approval, if
(i) the RMT Partner Board (or any committee thereof) shall have effected
(whether by resolution or public announcement) a RMT Partner Change in
Recommendation or (ii) if after the receipt and public disclosure of a
Competing Proposal, the RMT Partner Board shall have failed to publicly
reaffirm the RMT Partner Recommendation within ten (10) Business Days of such
public disclosure (and if the RMT Partner Shareholders Meeting is scheduled to
be held within ten (10) Business Days, then within two (2) Business Days of
such public disclosure); or

(h) by Remainco, prior to receipt of the RMT Partner Shareholder Approval, if
RMT Partner shall have breached in any material respect any of its
obligations under _Section_ __ _ 8.5_ or _Section_ __ _ 8.10_.

 

Section 10.2 Effect of Termination. In the event of termination of this
Agreement pursuant to  _Section_ __ _ 10.1_, this Agreement shall forthwith
become null and void and have no effect, without any Liability on the part of
any Party; _provided_ , _however_ , that no such termination shall relieve any
Party of any liability or damages resulting from fraud or Willful Breach;
_provided_ , _further_ , that the second and third sentences of _Section_ __ _
8.8_, this _Section_ __ _ 10.2_,  _Section_ __ _ 10.3_ and _Article XI_
hereof shall survive any termination of this Agreement. The Confidentiality
Agreement shall not be affected by a termination of this Agreement and shall

(a) Except as otherwise provided in the Separation and Distribution Agreement
or this Agreement, including this  _Section_ __ _ 10.3_, and except for (i)

RMT Partner in the event that this Agreement is terminated in accordance with
its terms or if the Closing occurs. The fees and expenses in clause (iv)
above shall be borne (A) entirely by Spinco if the Closing occurs, and (B)
equally by Remainco and RMT Partner if the Agreement terminates; _provided_

_Section_ __ _ 10.1(e)_, the fees and expenses in clause (iv) shall be borne
entirely by RMT Partner.



 



134

    

(b) RMT Partner shall pay to Remainco, by way of compensation, $521.5 million
(the " _Termination Payment_ "), by wire transfer of immediately available
funds (in U.S. dollars) to an account or accounts specified by Remainco, if
this Agreement is terminated as follows:

 

(i) if this Agreement is terminated pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 10.1(g)_ or 
_Section_ __ _ 10.1(h)_, then RMT Partner shall pay, or cause to be paid, the

(ii) if (x) this Agreement is terminated (1) by Remainco or RMT Partner
pursuant to (A) _ Section_ __ _ 10.1(c)_ or (B) _ Section_ __ _ 10.1(f)_
or (2) by Remainco pursuant _Section_ __ _ 10.1(e)_, (y) prior to such
termination, in the case of subclause (x)(1)(B) of this clause (ii), a
Competing Proposal shall have been publicly announced or otherwise becomes
publicly known after the date of this Agreement and prior to the RMT Partner
Shareholder Approval, or, in the case of clause (x)(1)(A) and (x)(2) of
this subclause (ii), a Competing Proposal shall have been publicly announced
or otherwise becomes publicly known or shall have been communicated to the RMT
Partner Board after the date of this Agreement and prior to such termination,
and (z) on or prior to the date that is twelve (12) months after the date of
such termination, a Competing Proposal is consummated or RMT Partner enters
into a definitive written agreement in respect of a Competing Proposal (which
need not be the same Competing Proposal referred to in clause (y)), then RMT
Partner shall be obligated to pay the Termination Payment on the third (3rd)
Business Day following the earlier of the date RMT Partner enters into a
definitive agreement in respect of or consummates such Competing Proposal;
_provided_ that, solely for purposes of this _Section_ __ _ 10.3(b)(ii)_, the
term " _Competing Proposal_ " shall have the meaning set forth in  _Section_
__ _ 8.10(e)_(i), except that all references to 15% shall be changed to 50%.

(c) In the event this Agreement is terminated by either Remainco or RMT
Partner pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 10.1(f)_, then RMT Partner shall pay to
Remainco (by wire transfer of immediately available funds promptly following
delivery by Remainco to RMT Partner of a written statement setting forth the
amount of the Remainco Expenses, including specifying the portion of Remainco
Expenses paid to each vendor on a vendor-by-vendor basis), all reasonable
out-of-pocket costs, fees and expenses incurred by Remainco (and, for the
avoidance of doubt, Spinco) in connection with this Agreement and
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including any costs, fees
and expenses allocated and paid by Remainco pursuant to _Section_ __ _
10.3(a)_ (the " _Remainco Expenses_ "); _provided_ that RMT Partner shall not
be obligated to pay the Remainco Expenses in excess of $75 million; _provided_
, _further_ , that any payment of the Remainco Expenses shall not affect
Remaincos right to receive any Termination Payment otherwise due under
_Section_ __ _ 10.3(b)_, but shall reduce, on a dollar-for-dollar basis, any
Termination Payment that becomes due and payable under  _Section_ __ _
10.3(b)_.

 



135

    

(d) In the event that, following delivery of the officers certificate
contemplated by Section 10.1(d), this Agreement is terminated (i) by RMT
Partner pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 10.1(d)_ or (ii) by Remainco or RMT
Partner pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 10.1(b)_,  _Section_ __ _ 10.1(c)_ or
_Section_ __ _ 10.1(f)_ and, in either case, Remainco failed to cure the
breach specified such officers certificate prior to such termination, then
Remainco shall pay to RMT Partner (by wire transfer of immediately available
funds promptly following delivery by RMT Partner to Remainco of a written
statement setting forth the amount of RMT Partner Expenses, including
specifying the portion of RMT Partner Expenses paid to each vendor on a
vendor-by-vendor basis), an amount equal to all reasonable out-of-
pocket costs, fees and expenses incurred by RMT Partner in connection with
this Agreement and the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement (the " _RMT Partner Expenses_ ");
_provided_  that Remainco shall not be obligated to pay the RMT Partner
Expenses in excess of $75 million.

(e) In the event of the valid termination of this Agreement in accordance
with this _Article X_ under circumstances in which the Termination Payment is
payable pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 10.3_, it is agreed that the
Termination Payment is not a penalty, but rather is liquidated damages in a
reasonable amount that will compensate Remainco and Spinco in the
circumstances in which such Termination Payment is payable for the efforts and
resources expended and opportunities foregone while negotiating this
Agreement, the Separation and Distribution Agreement and the other Transaction
Documents and in reliance on this Agreement and on the expectation of the
consummation of the Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby
and by the Transaction Documents, which amount would otherwise be impossible
to calculate with precision. Except with respect to claims resulting from
fraud or Willful Breach by the RMT Partner Entities, payment of any
Termination Payment shall constitute the sole and exclusive remedy of
Remainco and its Subsidiaries against the RMT Partner Entities, their
respective Subsidiaries and Affiliates, the Spinco Lenders, the other
Financing Sources and each of their respective Representatives, in
circumstances where the Termination Payment is payable under this Agreement
and the Termination Payment is paid. For the avoidance of doubt, the payment
by RMT Partner of the Termination Payment shall not relieve the RMT Partner
Entities, their respective Subsidiaries and Affiliates from any liability or
damages resulting from fraud or Willful Breach. Each Party agrees that the
agreements contained in this _Section_ __ _ 10.3_ are an integral part of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and that, without these
agreements, the Parties would not enter into this Agreement. Accordingly, if
RMT Partner fails to pay any amounts due under this _Section_ __ _ 10.3_ and,
in order to obtain such payment, Remainco commences a suit that results in a
judgment against RMT Partner for such amounts, RMT Partner shall pay interest
on such amounts from the date payment of such amounts was due to the date of
actual payment at a rate per annum equal to the Prime Rate in effect from
time to time for the relevant period, together with the costs and expenses of
Remainco (including reasonable legal fees and expenses) in connection with
such suit.

 



136

    

(f) The Parties acknowledge and agree that in no event shall RMT Partner be
required to pay more than one Termination Payment, even if a Termination
Payment may be payable under more than one provision of this Agreement at the
same time or at different times and upon the occurrence of different events.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this _Section_ __ _
10.3_ or elsewhere in this Agreement, in the event this Agreement is
terminated by RMT Partner for any reason at a time when Remainco would have
the right to terminate this Agreement, Remainco shall be entitled to receipt
of any Termination Payment that would have been (or would have subsequently
become) payable had Remainco terminated this Agreement at such time.

waiver by any of the Parties of any breach hereunder shall be deemed to extend
to any prior or subsequent breach hereunder or affect in any way any rights
arising by virtue of any prior or subsequent such occurrence. The failure or
delay of any Party to assert any of its rights hereunder or otherwise shall
not constitute a waiver of such rights. No waiver by any of the Parties of any
of the provisions hereof shall be effective unless explicitly set forth in
writing and executed by the Party sought to be charged with such waiver.

applicable Financing Agreement provide their prior written consent to such
amendment or modification.

Section 11.6 Governing Law; Jurisdiction; WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL.

 

(a) This Agreement and any dispute arising out of, in connection with or
relating to this Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance
with the Laws of the State of Delaware, without giving effect to the conflicts
of laws principles thereof.

(b) From the date hereof until Closing, each Party hereby irrevocably and
unconditionally submits to the exclusive jurisdiction of the Court of Chancery
of the State of Delaware or, if such court shall not have jurisdiction, the
United States District Court for the District of Delaware (or, if such court
shall not have jurisdiction, any state court in the state of Delaware), and
any appellate court from any appeal thereof, in any Action arising out of or
relating to this Agreement or the Transaction Documents or the transactions
contemplated hereby, and each Party hereby irrevocably and unconditionally (i)
agrees not to commence any such Action except in such courts, (ii) agrees that

Delaware or such other courts and (iv) waives, to the fullest extent permitted
by Law, the defense of an inconvenient forum to the maintenance of such Action
in the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware or such other courts.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, each
Party on behalf of itself and its controlled Affiliates: (i) agrees that it
will not bring or support any legal proceeding against any of the Spinco
Lenders or any of the other Financing Sources in any way relating to the
Financing in any forum other than the federal and New York state courts
located in the Borough of Manhattan within the City of New York; (ii) agrees
that, except as specifically set forth in the Spinco Commitment Letter or the
other Financing Agreements, all claims or causes of action (whether at law, in
equity, in contract, in tort or otherwise) against any of the Spinco Lenders
or any of the other Financing Sources relating to this Agreement, the Merger,
or any of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or the performance
of services related hereto, including any dispute arising out of or relating
in any way to the Financing, shall be exclusively governed by and construed
in accordance with the internal Laws of the State of New York; (iii) agrees to
waive and hereby waives, irrevocably and unconditionally, any right to a trial
by jury in any such legal action, suit or proceeding against any of the
Spinco Lenders or any of the other Financing Sources relating to the
Financing; and (iv) agrees to waive and hereby waives, to the fullest extent
permitted by applicable Law, any objection which such Party may now or
hereafter have to the laying of venue of, and the defense of an inconvenient
forum to the maintenance of, any such legal action, suit or proceeding against
any of the Spinco Lenders or any of the other Financing Sources relating to
the Financing in any such court. Each Party agrees that a final judgment in
any such Action shall be conclusive and may be enforced in other jurisdictions
by suit on the judgment or in any other manner provided by Law. Each
Party irrevocably consents to service of process in the manner provided for
notices in _Section_ __ _ 11.4_. Nothing in this Agreement will affect the
right of any Party to serve process in any other manner permitted by Law. From
and after the Closing, other than any Action expressly related to the
performance of the Parties under this Agreement (which shall continue to be
governed by this _Section_ __ _ 11.6_) any Action regarding the Separation
and Distribution Agreement or any Transaction Document shall be resolved in
accordance with the terms thereof.

 



139

    

(c) EACH PARTY HEREBY IRREVOCABLY AND UNCONDITIONALLY WAIVES ANY RIGHT SUCH
PARTY MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN RESPECT OF ANY ACTION DIRECTLY OR
INDIRECTLY ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT, ANY OF THE
TRANSACTION DOCUMENTS OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY OR THEREBY
(INCLUDING ANY FINANCING). EACH PARTY CERTIFIES AND ACKNOWLEDGES THAT (I) NO
REPRESENTATIVE, AGENT OR ATTORNEY OF ANY OTHER PARTY HAS REPRESENTED,
EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE, THAT SUCH OTHER PARTY WOULD NOT, IN THE EVENT OF
LITIGATION, SEEK TO ENFORCE THE FOREGOING WAIVER, (II) EACH SUCH
PARTY UNDERSTANDS AND HAS CONSIDERED THE IMPLICATIONS OF THIS WAIVER, (III)
EACH SUCH PARTY MAKES THIS WAIVER VOLUNTARILY AND (IV) EACH SUCH PARTY HAS
BEEN INDUCED TO ENTER INTO THIS AGREEMENT BY, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE MUTUAL
WAIVERS AND CERTIFICATIONS IN THIS _SECTION_ __ _ 11.6(c)_.

Section 11.7 Assignment; Parties in Interest; Non-Parties.

(a) No Party may assign its rights or delegate its duties under
this Agreement without the written consent of the other Parties and any
attempted assignment or delegation in breach of this _Section_ __ _ 11.7_
shall be null and void; provided, however, that Spinco may collaterally assign
its rights (but not obligations) under this Agreement to any of the Spinco
Lenders or any Lender Related Party or other financing source. The provisions
of this Agreement and the obligations and rights hereunder shall be binding
upon, inure to the benefit of and be enforceable by (and against) the Parties
and their respective successors and permitted transferees and assigns. Nothing
expressed or implied in this Agreement is intended or shall be construed to
confer upon or give any Person, other than the Parties, any rights or
remedies under or by reason of this Agreement, except as provided in _Section_
__ _ 8.9_ and this _Section_ __ _ 11.7_ (which is intended to be for the
benefit of the Persons covered thereby and may be enforced by such Persons).

 



140

    

(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, it is hereby
agreed and acknowledged that this Agreement may only be enforced against, and
any claims of action that may be based upon, arise out of or relate to this
Agreement or the negotiation, execution or performance of this Agreement may
only be made against, the Parties hereto, and no former, current or future
Affiliates, officers, directors, managers, employees, equityholders, Spinco
Lenders or other Financing Sources, managers, members, partners, agents or
representatives of any Party, in each case, who is not a Party to this
Agreement, shall have any liability for any obligations of the Parties hereto
or for any claim based on, in respect of, or by reason of, the transactions
contemplated hereby. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Spinco Lenders and
the other Financing Sources are third-party beneficiaries of Section __ _
10.3(e)_, _Section_ __ _ 11.5(b)_, _Section_ __ _ 11.6(b)_, _Section_ __ _
11.6(c)_ and this  _Section_ __ _ 11.7_. This _Section_ __ _ 11.7(b)_ shall
not affect (a) the rights of the Persons party to the Spinco Commitment Letter
to enforce the Spinco Commitment Letter in accordance with its terms; or (b)
the rights and obligations of the Parties hereto set forth in _Section_ __ _
8.7_.

 

Section 11.8 Title and Headings. Titles and headings to sections herein are
inserted for the convenience of reference only and are not intended to be a
part of or to affect the meaning or interpretation of this Agreement.

 

Section 11.9 Specific Performance. The Parties acknowledge and agree that
irreparable harm would occur in the event that the Parties do not perform any
provision of this Agreement (or, prior to the Closing, any Transaction
Document) in accordance with its specific terms or otherwise breach this
Agreement (or, prior to the Closing, any Transaction Document) and the
remedies at law for any breach or threatened (whether or not in writing)
breach of this Agreement (or, prior to the Closing, any Transaction Document),
including monetary damages, are inadequate compensation for any Loss.
Accordingly, in the event of any actual or threatened (whether or not in
writing) default in, or breach of, any of the terms, conditions and provisions
of this Agreement (or, prior to the Closing, any Transaction Document), the
Parties agree that the Party to this Agreement who is thereby aggrieved shall
have the right to specific performance and injunctive or other equitable
relief of its or their rights under this Agreement or, if they are Party to a
Transaction Document, such Transaction Document, without the necessity of
proving actual damages or the inadequacy of monetary damages as a remedy, in
addition to any other remedy to which such Party is entitled at law or in
equity. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the Parties
hereto agree that each Party shall be entitled to enforce specifically the
other Parties obligations to consummate the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement (including the obligation to consummate the Closing and the
obligations with respect to the Financing), in addition to any and all other
rights and remedies at law or in equity, and all such rights and remedies
shall be cumulative, if the conditions set forth in _Article IX_ have been
satisfied (other than the conditions set forth in _Section_ __ _ 9.1(b)_ and
_Section_ __ _ 9.1(c)_ and those conditions which by their nature are to be
satisfied at the Closing) or waived (where permissible under applicable Law).
The Parties agree that any defense in any Action for specific performance
that a remedy at law would be adequate is hereby waived, and that any
requirements for the securing or posting of any bond with such remedy are
hereby waived.

 



141

    

Section 11.10 Severability. In the event any one or more of the provisions
contained in this Agreement or any Transaction Document, or the application of
any provision to any Person or circumstance, should be held invalid, illegal
or unenforceable in any respect, the validity, legality and enforceability
of the remaining provisions contained herein and therein shall not be
affected or impaired thereby. The Parties shall endeavor in good-faith
negotiations to replace the invalid, illegal or unenforceable provisions with
valid, legal and enforceable provisions, the economic effect of which comes
as close as possible to that of the invalid, illegal or unenforceable
provisions and, to the extent necessary, shall amend or otherwise modify this
Agreement to replace any provision contained herein that is held invalid,
illegal or unenforceable with a valid, legal and enforceable provision giving
effect to the intent of the Parties.
