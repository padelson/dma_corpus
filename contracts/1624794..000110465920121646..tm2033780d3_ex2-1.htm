" _Seller_ " and collectively, " _Sellers_ ") and, solely for purposes of
_Sections 1.8_ , _6.5(d)_  and _13.18_ , CSW Industrials, Inc., a Delaware
corporation (" _Parent_ "). The parties hereto are individually each a "
_Party_ " and collectively the " _Parties_." _Exhibit A_ contains definitions
of certain terms used in this Agreement.

  



  

RECITALS

  



  

A. Sellers collectively own all of the shares of common stock, no par
value, of the Company set forth opposite their respective names on _Annex I_
hereto (the " _Shares_ "), which Shares represent all of the issued and
outstanding Equity Interests of the Company.

  



  

B. Sellers each desire to sell, and Buyer desires to purchase, the
Shares for the consideration, on the terms and subject to the conditions set
forth in this Agreement.

  



  

C. Concurrently with the execution and delivery of this Agreement, as a
condition to Buyer's willingness to enter into this Agreement, Yongki Yi and
Tony Yi are each entering into consulting agreements with Buyer (the "
_Consulting Agreements_ "), which Consulting Agreements shall be effective
upon the Closing.

  



  

D. Prior to the Closing, Sellers and Parent shall enter into the
Registration Rights Agreement (defined below) providing for certain
registration rights of Sellers with respect to the Parent Stock acquired by
Sellers as partial consideration for the sale of the Shares hereunder.

  



  

AGREEMENT

  



  

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing premises and the
representations, warranties and agreements contained herein, and intending to
be legally bound hereby, the Parties agree as follows:

  



  

ARTICLE 1 _ 
 PURCHASE AND SALE; THE CLOSING_

  



  

1.1 _Purchase and Sale of the Shares_. On the terms and subject to the
conditions of this Agreement, at the Closing, Sellers shall sell, transfer
and deliver the Shares to Buyer, and Buyer shall purchase the Shares from
Sellers.

  



  

1.2 _Purchase Price_. Subject to adjustment as provided in _ARTICLE 2_ ,
the aggregate purchase price for the Shares shall be $284,000,000 in cash
(the " _Unadjusted Cash Consideration_ "), plus or minus any Net Adjustment

" _Stock Consideration_ "). The number of shares of Parent Stock comprising
the Stock Consideration shall be equitably adjusted in the event of a

 | -5-| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

1.3 _Tax Withholding_. Buyer shall be entitled to deduct and withhold
from the amounts payable pursuant to this Agreement such amounts as Buyer is
required to deduct and withhold with respect to the making of such payments
under any provision of U.S. federal, state, local or foreign Tax Law and
instead shall pay such amount to the applicable Governmental Authority. Before
making any such deduction or withholding, Buyer shall use reasonable best
efforts to give Seller Representative notice of the intention to make such
deduction or withholding at least three Business Days prior to making any such
deduction or withholding (except in the case of any withholding required as a
result of a failure to deliver a non-foreign seller affidavit as set forth in
_Section 1.5(a)(vi)_ or any withholding on compensatory payments made in
connection with this Agreement), and such notice shall include the authority,
basis and method of calculation for the proposed deduction or withholding, in
order for Seller Representative to assist the applicable payee in obtaining
reduction of, or relief from, such deduction or withholding to the extent
allowed under Law. To the extent that amounts are properly so withheld by
Buyer and paid to the applicable Governmental Authority, such
amounts withheld shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as
having been paid to the recipient in respect of which such deduction and
withholding was made by Buyer.

  



  

1.4 _Closing_. The consummation of the sale of the Shares (the "
_Closing_ ") shall occur on the third Business Day after the last of the
conditions set forth in _ARTICLE 9_ and _ARTICLE 10_ (other than those
conditions that, by their terms, cannot be satisfied until the Closing but
which are capable of being satisfied at the Closing) has been satisfied or
waived. The Closing shall be held virtually (via the exchange of executed
documents and other deliverables by PDF or other means of electronic
delivery) rather than in-person. The date on which the Closing is actually
held is referred to herein as the " _Closing Date_ ". The sale of the Shares
shall be deemed (for corporate, tax, accounting and all other purposes) to
take place and to be effective at 11:59 p.m. (Venue time) on the Closing Date
(the " _Effective Time_ "), except as may otherwise be expressly provided
herein.

shall cause the Transfer Agent to record, for each Seller, such Seller's
ownership on Parent's books and records of the number of shares of Parent
Stock equal to such Seller's Pro Rata Share multiplied by the aggregate Stock
Consideration and to make appropriate notations regarding the applicable
restrictions on transfer of such Parent Stock. Each Seller will cooperate
with Buyer as reasonably requested by Buyer to furnish Parent and the
Transfer Agent information concerning each such Seller that may be required or
reasonably requested in connection with the actions contemplated by this
_Section 1.8_.

  



  

ARTICLE 2 _ 
 PURCHASE PRICE ADJUSTMENT_

  



  

2.1 _Estimated Closing Working Capital, Cash, Indebtedness, and
Seller Transaction Expenses_. At least five Business Days prior to
the Closing Date, Sellers shall cause the Company to prepare and deliver to
Buyer a statement (the " _Estimated Closing Statement_ ") of: (a) the
estimated amount of the Closing Working Capital (the " _Estimated
Closing Working Capital_ "), and the Estimated Closing Working Capital
Surplus or the Estimated Closing Working Capital Deficiency, as the case may
be, (b) the estimated amount of the Closing Cash (the " _Estimated
Closing Cash_ "), (c) the estimated amount of the Closing Indebtedness (the "
_Estimated Closing Indebtedness_ "), and (d) the estimated amount of the
Seller Transaction Expenses (the " _Estimated Seller Transaction Expenses_
"), in each case, prepared in good faith based on the Company's books and
records and other available information, together with reasonable supporting
detail and, in the case of the Estimated Closing Working Capital, in
accordance with the principles set forth on _Exhibit E_ and the example of
Working Capital set forth on _Annex II_. Buyer shall be entitled to comment
on the Estimated Closing Statement and Sellers shall consider in good faith
any such comments. If Buyer and Sellers are unable to resolve any comments
with respect to the Estimated Closing Statement, the comments shall not delay
the Closing and the amounts in dispute shall be calculated as set forth in the
Estimated Closing Statement provided by the Company. Immediately prior to the
Closing, an itemized physical count of the inventory of the Group Companies
will be conducted by Buyer utilizing an independent third-party inventory
counter mutually agreed upon between Buyer and Seller Representative ("
_Inventory Count_ "). The Group Companies and Sellers shall have the right to
have present for such Inventory Count such Representatives as they deem
reasonably necessary to monitor such process. The independent third-party
inventory counter shall deliver to Buyer and Seller Representative a report
showing the results of the Inventory Count, which results shall be binding on
Buyer and Sellers solely with respect to the count for each item
of inventory. For purposes of determining Closing Working Capital pursuant to
this _ARTICLE 2_ , and notwithstanding anything contained in the example of
Working Capital set forth on _Annex II_ , the value of the inventory of the
Group Companies as of immediately prior to the Closing shall be determined in
accordance with the principles set forth on _Exhibit E_ using the Inventory
Count conducted pursuant to this _Section 2.1_. The costs and expenses
incurred in connection with the Inventory Count shall be borne equally by
Buyer, on the one hand, and Sellers, on the other hand.

  



  

   

 | -9-| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

2.2 _Buyer Closing Statement_. Within 90 days following the Closing
Date, Buyer shall cause the Company to prepare and deliver to Seller
Representative a consolidated balance sheet of the Group Companies as of the
Effective Time and a statement (together, with the balance sheet, the "
_Buyer Closing Statement_ ") of Buyer's calculations of the following
amounts: (a) the Closing Working Capital, (b) the Closing Cash, (c) the
Closing Indebtedness, and (d) the Seller Transaction Expenses.
Notwithstanding anything contained herein to the contrary, the amounts set
forth on the Buyer Closing Statement shall not reflect any purchase
accounting adjustments as a result of the Transactions. After the due date for
the Buyer Closing Statement, Buyer may not object to any item in the
Estimated Closing Statement or change any amount set forth in the Buyer
Closing Statement, and any matter from the Estimated Closing Statement not
changed in the Buyer Closing Statement shall be deemed accepted by, and final
and binding upon, Buyer.

  



  

2.3 _Disagreement and Resolution_.

  



  

(a) During the Review Period, Buyer shall provide Seller
Representative with reasonable access, during normal business hours upon
reasonable advance notice and in such a manner as not to unreasonably
interfere with the normal conduct of each Group Company's operations, to all
books and records (including work papers to the extent permitted by the access
policies of Buyer's and each Group Company's accountants, as applicable) and
appropriate personnel of the Group Companies to enable Seller
Representative to determine the Closing Cash, Closing Indebtedness, Seller
Transaction Expenses and Closing Working Capital and to evaluate the accuracy
of the Buyer Closing Statement, and Buyer shall respond promptly and in good
faith and as fully and accurately as is reasonably practicable to inquiries
from Seller Representative related to such review. Buyer shall provide access
to the books and records of the Group Companies electronically and transmit
financial statements, general journals and trial balances of the Group
Companies in such formats as they are prepared on the date of this Agreement
to the extent reasonable and available. If Seller Representative disagrees
with any portion of the Buyer Closing Statement, then Seller Representative
shall notify Buyer in writing of such disagreement within the Review Period,
which notice shall describe the nature of any such disagreement in reasonable
detail and identify the specific items involved and the dollar amount, if
known, of each such disagreement. After the Review Period, Seller
Representative may not introduce additional disagreements with respect to any
item in the Buyer Closing Statement or increase the amount of
any disagreement, and any item not so identified shall be deemed to be agreed
to by the Parties and will be final and binding.

(b) Buyer and Seller Representative shall use their respective
reasonable best efforts to resolve any disagreements pertaining to the Buyer
Closing Statement; however, if Buyer and Seller Representative are unable to
resolve all disagreements identified by Seller Representative pursuant to
_Section 2.3(a)_ within 30 days after delivery to Buyer of written notice of
such disagreements, then such disagreements shall be submitted for final and
binding resolution to a Neutral Accounting Firm to resolve such disagreements
(the " _Accounting Expert_ "). During such 30-day period, each side shall
notify the other side of the Neutral Accounting Firm that such side proposes
to be the Accounting Expert. At the end of such 30-day period: (i) if one
side has failed to timely notify the other side in accordance with the
previous sentence, then the other side's proposed Neutral Accounting Firm
shall act as the Accounting Expert (assuming that the other side
provided timely notice in accordance with the previous sentence); (ii) if
both sides have mutually agreed on a Neutral Accounting Firm to act as the
Accounting Expert, then such Neutral Accounting Firm shall be the Accounting
Expert; (iii) if Buyer and Seller Representative are unable to agree on a
Neutral Accounting Firm to act as the Accounting Expert and each Party has
timely proposed a Neutral Accounting Firm in accordance with the previous
sentence, then the two proposed Neutral Accounting Firms together shall
select a third Neutral Accounting Firm within five days to act as the
Accounting Expert. Each Party shall be permitted to present a supporting
brief to the Accounting Expert (which supporting brief shall also be
concurrently provided to the other Party) within 10 days following the
appointment of the Accounting Expert. Within five days following receipt of a
supporting brief, the receiving Party may present a responsive brief to the
Accounting Expert (which responsive brief shall also be concurrently provided
to the other Party). No discovery will be permitted and no arbitration hearing
will be held. The Accounting Expert shall only consider the briefs of the
parties, and shall not conduct any independent review, in determining those
items and amounts disputed by the parties, and the Accounting Expert shall
consider only those items and amounts which are identified by the parties as
being in dispute. The Accounting Expert may ask specific written questions
or request specific historical documents from Buyer or Seller Representative
to clarify its understanding of the submissions (and any document provided by
Buyer or Seller Representative to the Accounting Expert shall also be
concurrently provided to the other Party). The Accounting Expert shall
resolve the dispute by selecting either the position of Buyer or
Seller Representative (and may not propose or make any alternative position)
for each item that is subject to the Accounting Expert's determination and
must resolve the matter in accordance with the terms and provisions of this
Agreement. The Accounting Expert shall deliver to Buyer and Seller
Representative, as promptly as practicable and in any event within 90 days
after its appointment, a written report setting forth the resolution of any
such disagreement determined in accordance with the terms of this Agreement.
The determination of the Accounting Expert shall be final, binding and non-
appealable absent fraud or malfeasance. All fees of the Accounting Expert
shall be allocated between Buyer, on the one hand, and Sellers, on the other
hand, such that the amount paid by Sellers bears the same proportion that the
aggregate dollar amount unsuccessfully disputed by Seller Representative (on
behalf of Sellers) bears to the total dollar amount of the disputed items
that were submitted for resolution to the Accounting Expert, and Buyer shall
pay the balance. For purposes of illustration only, if the Net Adjustment
Amount in favor of Sellers is proposed to be $1,000 by Seller Representative
and $900 by Buyer and such Net Adjustment Amount is ultimately determined by
the Accounting Expert to be $960, then Sellers would bear 40% of the fees of
the Accounting Expert and Buyer would bear 60%, because the amount disputed
was $100 and the amount unsuccessfully disputed by Seller Representative (on
behalf of Sellers) was $40. Any fees of the Accounting Expert to be paid by
Sellers shall be paid by Sellers in accordance with each Seller's Pro Rata
Share.

financial reporting that is designed, and is sufficient, to
provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting
and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in
accordance with GAAP, which includes policies and procedures that: (i) pertain
to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and
fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the Group
Companies; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as
necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with
GAAP, and that receipts and expenditures of the Group Companies are being made
only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the
Group Companies; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention
or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the
assets of the Group Companies that could have a material effect on the
consolidated financial statements of the Group Companies. To the Knowledge of
the Company, there are no material weaknesses in the design or operation of
such internal control over financial reporting that are reasonably likely to
adversely affect the Company's ability to record, process, summarize and
report financial data. To the Knowledge of the Company, there are no internal
or governmental inquiries or investigations pending or threatened regarding
any accounting practices of any Group Company, any malfeasance by a director
of any Group Company, or an employee of the Group Company at a level of Vice
President or above.

  



  

(c) No Group Company is a party to, or has any commitment to become a
party to, any joint venture, off-balance sheet partnership or any similar
Contract, including any Contract relating to any transaction or relationship
between or among any Group Company, on the one hand, and any unconsolidated
Affiliate, including any structured finance, special purpose or limited
purpose entity or Person, on the other hand, or any "off-balance sheet
arrangements" (as defined in Item 303(a) of Regulation S-K of the Securities
Act), where the result, purpose or effect of such Contract is to avoid
disclosure of any material transaction involving, or material liabilities of,
any Group Company in the Financial Statements.

  



  

4.7 _Transactions with Affiliates_. _Section 4.7_ of the Disclosure
Schedule sets forth a true, correct and complete list of all business
relationships or Contracts existing as of the date hereof between a Group
Company, on the one hand, and any of its Affiliates, officers or directors of
a Group Company, or any Seller or Affiliates of such Seller, on the other
hand. Except as set forth in _Section 4.7_ of the Disclosure Schedule, none
of Sellers or any of their respective Affiliates (other than the Group
Companies) or any of their respective directors, officers or employees: (a) is
party to any transaction with any Group Company or (b) has any ownership
interest in any property (real, personal or mixed), tangible or intangible,
which is used in the operation of the businesses of any Group Company (other

operation of the businesses of any Group Company).

  



  

4.8 _Tangible Personal Property; Sufficiency of Assets_.

  



  

(a) The Group Companies have good and valid legal title to, or a
valid leasehold interest in, each item of tangible personal property and
other assets owned or purported to be owned by the Group Companies or
reflected on the Most Recent Financial Statements (except as sold or disposed
of subsequent to the date thereof in the ordinary course of business), in each
case free and clear of any and all Encumbrances.

  



  

   

 | -19-| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

(b) The businesses of the Group Companies are conducted only through
the Group Companies. The assets and personal property, tangible and
intangible, currently owned or purported to be owned, leased, licensed, used
or held for use by the Group Companies are sufficient in all material
respects for the operation of the businesses of the Group Companies as
presently conducted. As of the Closing, a Group Company will lease, own,
license, use or hold for use all of the assets or personal property,
tangible or intangible, utilized in the operation of the businesses of the
Group Companies as presently conducted. All tangible personal property and
assets of the Group Companies (except as sold or disposed of subsequent to the
date of the Most Recent Financial Statements in the ordinary course of
business) that, individually or in the aggregate, are material to
the operation of the businesses of the Group Companies as currently
conducted, are, in all material respects, in good working condition (ordinary
wear and tear excepted), except to the extent specifically and adequately
reserved for, written off or written down in the Most Recent Financial
Statements. None of the material tangible personal property and material
assets of the Group Companies have been (i) operated or maintained other than
in the ordinary course of business or (ii) adversely affected in any way as a
result of any fire, explosion, earthquake, disaster, flood, erosion, accident
or other similar casualty, whether or not covered by insurance. The Group
Companies have made all capital expenditures in the ordinary course of
business, and none of the Group Companies has reduced or otherwise delayed any
capital expenditures specifically in contemplation of the execution of this
Agreement and the consummation of the Transactions. Since the Reference Date,
there has not been any significant interruption of operations of the
businesses of the Group Companies due to inadequate maintenance of such
tangible property.

  



  

4.9 _No Undisclosed Liabilities; Indebtedness_.

  



  

(a) No Group Company has any material liabilities except for (i)
liabilities specifically and adequately disclosed, reflected or reserved

Family Trust as a Seller hereunder shall be reduced by an amount equal to the
outstanding principal balance and interest of the outstanding director loan
payable by Yongki Yi to the Company as of the Closing Date (the " _Yongki
Director Loan Balance_ ") and (b) UKJ, LLC as a Seller hereunder shall be
reduced by an amount equal to the outstanding principal balance and interest
of the outstanding director loan payable by Tony Yi to the Company as of the
Closing Date (the " _Tony Director Loan Balance_ ") (the aggregate of such
balances, the " _Director Loan Balances_ "). At least five Business Days
prior to the Closing Date, the Company shall deliver a written statement to
Buyer setting forth the true and correct Tony Director Loan Balance and
Yongki Director Loan Balance. The Parties agree that: (x) for U.S. federal and
applicable state and local income tax purposes: (i) Tony Yi and Yongki Yi
shall be treated as having repaid the Tony Director Loan Balance and Yongki
Director Loan Balance, respectively, in full immediately prior to the Closing;
(ii) the 2014 Yi Family Trust shall be treated as having (A) received an
amount equal to the Yongki Director Loan Balance in partial consideration of
the 2014 Yi Family Trust's Shares and (B) distributed an amount equal to the
Yongki Director Loan Balance to Yongki Yi; and (iii) UKJ, LLC shall be
treated as having (A) received an amount equal to the Tony Director Loan
Balance in partial consideration of UKJ, LLC's Shares and (B) distributed an
amount equal to the Tony Director Loan Balance to Tony Yi; and (y) for
purposes of calculating the Closing Cash and the funds paid at the Closing,
an amount equal to the Director Loan Balances shall be added to the Closing
Cash (i.e., to account for the fact that the Director Loan Balances were
deemed to be paid back to the Company in cash prior to the Closing). For
purposes of illustration only, _Schedule 6.14_ sets forth an example of how
the Director Loan Balances would be treated at Closing, as well as the
resulting change in proceeds to Sellers and Closing Cash.

  



  

ARTICLE 7 _ 
 OTHER AGREEMENTS_

  



  

7.1 _RWI Policy_. Buyer has delivered to Seller Representative
evidence that Buyer has obtained (i.e., bound and incepted as of the date
hereof) at its sole expense a conditional binder from the insurance company
identified therein committing to issue, and Buyer shall cause to be in effect
at the Closing, a representation and warranty insurance policy covering the
representations and warranties given by Sellers under this Agreement, the
Company's Tax liabilities for the Pre-Closing Tax Period, and the other
matters (if any) covered by such policy (the " _RWI Policy_ "). Buyer shall
cause the RWI Policy to include a provision whereby the insurer expressly
waives, and irrevocably agrees not to pursue, directly or indirectly,
any subrogation rights against any Seller or any Affiliate thereof, or any
current or former equityholders, directors, managers, officers or employees
of any of the foregoing with respect to any claim made by any insured
thereunder, which waiver any Seller may enforce directly against the insurer
of the RWI Policy, other than in the event of Fraud committed by a Seller
in the making of the representations set forth in _ARTICLE 3_ or _ARTICLE 4_.
Buyer shall not waive, amend, modify or otherwise revise this subrogation
provision under the RWI Policy, or allow such provision to be waived, amended,
modified or otherwise revised by any other Person without the consent of
Sellers. Buyer shall be solely responsible for all fees, expenses or other
obligations in connection with the RWI Policy. Buyer shall (a) comply with and
maintain the RWI Policy in full force and effect, (b) pay when due all
premiums, fees, costs and Taxes payable thereunder and (c) take all
reasonable actions within its control to satisfy on a timely basis all
conditions necessary for the issuance of or continuance of coverage under the
RWI Policy. Buyer and its Affiliates shall not knowingly take actions that
would cause such policy to be (x) amended or waived in a manner that would
have a negative and adverse impact on Sellers without the prior written
consent of Sellers or (y) terminated or cancelled.

7.2   _Non-Competition; Non-Solicitation; Non-Disparagement_.

  



  

(a)  During the period beginning on the Closing Date and ending
on the fifth anniversary of the Closing Date, each Seller agrees that such
Seller shall not, nor shall it permit its Affiliates to, either directly or
indirectly (individually, or through or on behalf of another Person):

  



  

(i)  establish, engage, own, manage, operate or control, or
participate in the establishment, ownership, management, operation or control
of, or be a director, officer, manager, employee, salesman, agent or
representative of, or be a consultant to, any Person that competes with the
businesses of the Group Companies as currently conducted in the Restricted
Territory; _provided_ , _however_ , that such Person shall not be prohibited
from owning up to 3% of the outstanding equity securities of a company that is
publicly traded on a national securities exchange or in the over the counter
market so long as such Person has no active participation in connection with
the business of such company;

  



  

(ii)  hire, solicit, encourage or induce or attempt to induce
any employee of a Group Company to leave the employment of such Group
Company, or to become employed by or to enter into a business relationship
with any other Person; _provided_ , _however_ , that a general solicitation
not specifically targeted at the employees of a Group Company shall not be a
violation of this clause (ii); or

  



  

(iii)  except as required in the normal course of duties for its
business, request, knowingly induce or knowingly attempt to limit or
influence any customer, employee, supplier or other business entity to limit
or curtail in any material respect or cancel or terminate any business it
transacts with, or products or services it provides to or receives from the
Group Companies.

  



  

(b) Each Seller agrees that such Seller shall not, nor shall its
Affiliates, at any time, intentionally disparage in any material
respect Parent, Buyer, the Group Companies, any Affiliate of the foregoing,
any of its or their respective businesses, members or Representatives, or the
reputation of any of the foregoing Persons. Buyer shall not, nor shall its
Affiliates, at any time, intentionally disparage in any material respect any
Seller, any of its Affiliates or any of its or their respective businesses,
managers, equity holders or Representatives, or the reputation of any of the
foregoing Persons. This _Section 7.2(b)_ shall not apply to (i)
testimony obtained through subpoena or (ii) any information provided pursuant
to an investigation by any Governmental Authority.

  



  

   

-47-

 



    



     

(c)   If, at the time of enforcement of the covenants contained
in this _Section 7.2_ (the " _Restrictive Covenants_ "), a court shall hold
that the duration, scope or area restrictions stated herein are unreasonable
under the circumstances then existing, Buyer and each Seller agree that the
maximum duration, scope or area reasonable under such circumstances shall be
substituted for the stated duration, scope or area and that the court shall
be allowed and directed to revise the restrictions contained herein to cover
the maximum period, scope and area permitted by applicable Law. Each Party has
consulted with legal counsel regarding the Restrictive Covenants and based on
such consultation has determined and hereby acknowledges that the Restrictive
Covenants are reasonable in terms of duration, scope and areas restrictions
and are necessary to protect the goodwill of the Group Companies and their
businesses and the substantial investment in such businesses and the Group
Companies made by Buyer. Each Party further agrees that it will not challenge
the reasonableness of the duration, scope and area restrictions in any Action
with respect to the Restrictive Covenants, regardless of who initiates such
Action.

  



  

7.3   _Release_. Effective as of the Closing, (a) each Seller
hereby irrevocably waives, releases and discharges, and shall cause its
respective Affiliates not to assert, in its, his or her capacity as a direct
or indirect equityholder of the Group Companies, to the fullest extent
permitted by applicable Law, any claims, or take or bring any Actions, against
the Group Companies or any of their directors, officers or managers and (b)
Buyer, as agent for each Group Company following the Closing, hereby
irrevocably waives, releases and discharges, to the fullest extent permitted
by applicable Law, any claims, and shall not take or bring any Actions,
against any Sellers in their capacity as a director, officer or manager of the
Group Companies, in each case in relation to any and all liabilities and
other obligations of whatever kind or nature, in Law, equity or otherwise,
arising from, connected or related to, caused by or based on any facts,
conduct, activities, agreements, transactions, events or occurrences known or
unknown, of any type that existed, occurred, happened, arose or transpired
from the beginning of time through the Closing Date; _provided_ ,  _however_
, that nothing in this _Section 7.3_ shall affect rights or obligations under
this Agreement or any Ancillary Document or the indemnification obligations
of a Group Company to any Seller in such Seller's capacity as director,
officer or manager under such Group Company's organizational documents made
available to Buyer prior to the date of this Agreement. The Parties
acknowledge that the Laws of many states (including Section 1542 of the
California Civil Code) provide substantially the following: "A GENERAL
RELEASE DOES NOT EXTEND TO CLAIMS THAT THE CREDITOR OR RELEASING PARTY DOES
NOT KNOW OR SUSPECT TO EXIST IN HIS OR HER FAVOR AT THE TIME OF EXECUTING THE
RELEASE AND THAT, IF KNOWN BY HIM OR HER, WOULD HAVE MATERIALLY AFFECTED HIS
OR HER SETTLEMENT WITH THE DEBTOR OR RELEASED PARTY." The Parties acknowledge
that such provisions are designed to protect a party from waiving claims
which it does not know exist or may exist. Nonetheless, the Parties hereby
agree that, effective as of the Closing Date, the Parties shall be deemed to
waive any such provision of state, local and foreign Law.

  



  

   

-48-

 



    



  

7.4   _Access to Records after the Closing_.

  



  

(a) For a period of seven years after the Closing Date, to the
extent permitted by applicable Law, Sellers shall have reasonable access to
all of the books and records of the Group Companies, solely to the extent that
such access is required for a proper purpose by a Seller in connection with
matters relating to or affected by the operations of the Group Companies prior
to the Closing Date, including the preparation of a Seller's financial
reports, and the defense or prosecution of litigation (including arbitration
or mediation) concerning the businesses of the Group Companies prior to the
Closing (other than legal proceedings between any Seller, on the one hand,
and Buyer or its Affiliates, on the other hand). Such access shall
be afforded by Buyer upon receipt of reasonable advance written notice from
such Seller, during normal business hours and may not unreasonably interfere
with the conduct of Buyer's or its Affiliates' (including the Group
Companies') businesses. A Seller seeking access shall be solely responsible
for any costs or expenses incurred by such Seller seeking access pursuant to
this _Section 7.4_. If any such books or records, or any other documents which
Sellers have the right to have access to pursuant to this _Section 7.4_ are
produced by Buyer or the Group Companies to an actual or potentially adverse
party (e.g., in litigation or in connection with a government investigation),
Buyer shall endeavor to as promptly as reasonably practicable make all such
books, records and/or documents produced available for inspection and copying
by Sellers concurrently with the production of such books, records and/or
documents. In addition, if Buyer or a Group Company shall desire to dispose
of any of such books or records prior to the expiration of such seven year
period, Buyer shall, prior to such disposition, give Sellers a reasonable
opportunity to segregate and remove such books and records as Sellers may
select for good reason shown and Sellers shall pay all reasonable expenses of
Buyer in connection therewith.

  



  

(b)  Any Seller may retain copies of any Contracts, documents or
records: (i) which relate to properties or activities of such Seller, unless
such Contracts, documents and records also relate to the properties or
activities of a Group Company, or (ii) which are required to be retained
pursuant to any legal requirement or are subject to the attorney-client
privilege, or for financial reporting purposes, for Tax purposes or for legal
defense or prosecution purposes, and may retain electronic records of such
information on computer hard drives and other electronic media.

  



  

7.5   _Fidelity Charitable_. Notwithstanding anything herein or
in any Ancillary Document to the contrary, each Party acknowledges that
Fidelity Charitable is a public charity and agrees that Fidelity Charitable is
not (a) making any representations or warranties in this Agreement or in any
Ancillary Document other than those set forth in _ARTICLE 3_ or (b) agreeing
to any covenants, including those set forth in _Sections 7.2_ , _8.1(a)_
(including in respect of Sellers' responsibility for costs and expenses
relating to the Seller Returns) and _11.2_ of this Agreement. In no event
shall Buyer or any Affiliate thereof be entitled to bring any claims or
pursue any other recourse, at law or in equity, from or against Fidelity
Charitable arising from or relating to this Agreement or any Ancillary
Document or through state, federal or local Laws, except to the extent
related to the transfer to Buyer of good title to all the Shares owned by
Fidelity Charitable free and clear of all Encumbrances in accordance with the
terms of this Agreement. Each of Elizabeth Chong, Andrew Yi, Yongki Yi and
Tony Yi shall be jointly and severally responsible for Fidelity Charitable's
representations and warranties in _ARTICLE 3_ and _ARTICLE 4_ and its
covenants contained in this Agreement, and shall bear Fidelity Charitable's
share of any associated liability arising with respect thereto.

ARTICLE 8

     

 _TAX MATTERS_

  



  

8.1   _Tax Returns_.

  



  

(a)  Seller Representative, at Sellers' sole cost and expense,
shall engage RSM to prepare or cause to be prepared all Tax Returns that are
first due by or on behalf of any Group Company (taking into account extensions
validly obtained) after the Closing Date that relate to a taxable period
ending on or before the Closing Date (the " _Seller Returns_ ") and such
Seller Returns shall be prepared in a manner consistent with past practice of
such Group Company unless a different treatment of any item is required by
applicable Law. Seller Representative shall permit Buyer to review and comment
on each such Seller Return that relates to income Taxes at least 30 days
prior to the filing date with respect to such Seller Return (taking into
account extensions validly obtained), and in the case of any other Seller
Return, Seller Representative shall provide such Seller Returns to Buyer for
its review and comment as soon as practicable but in no event later than 10
days prior to the filing date with respect to such Seller Return (taking into
account extensions validly obtained). Seller Representative shall incorporate
any reasonable revisions provided prior to the due date for a Seller Return
(taking into account extensions validly obtained) by Buyer to
Seller Representative in writing with respect to a Seller Return.
Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, none of Buyer or
its Representatives shall be required to sign or file any Seller Return if
Buyer or its Representative believes in good faith that a position reflected
on such Seller Return is not supportable at a "more likely than not" or
greater level of comfort. If Seller Representative and Buyer are unable to
resolve any such dispute at least 10 days prior to the due date
(including applicable extensions) for filing any such Seller Return, the
dispute will be referred to the Accounting Expert for resolution in
accordance with the provisions of _Section 8.13_.

  



  

(b) Buyer, at its sole cost and expense, shall prepare and
timely file (or cause the applicable Group Company to prepare and
timely file) all Tax Returns that relate to a Straddle Period (the " _Buyer
Returns_ "), and such Buyer Returns shall be prepared on a basis consistent
with those prepared for prior taxable periods, unless a different treatment of
any item is required by applicable Law (including Section 482 of the Code).
Buyer shall (i) provide Seller Representative with a copy of such completed
Buyer Return at least 30 days prior to the due date for filing such Buyer
Return (taking into account extensions validly obtained), (ii) cause any
deductions arising from the payment of Seller Transaction Expenses to
be reflected in the Pre-Closing Tax Period to the extent that such amounts
are deductible at a more-likely-than-not or greater level of comfort in a
Pre-Closing Tax Period (and shall not be allocated to a Post-Closing Tax
Period under the "next day" rule of Treasury Regulations Section
1.1502-76(b)(1)(ii)(B) (or make any similar election or ratably
allocate items under any corresponding provision of state, local or foreign
Law)), (iii) incorporate any reasonable comments provided by Seller
Representative with respect to such Tax Return that are supportable at a more-
likely-than-not or greater level of comfort under applicable Law and that are
provided no fewer than 3 days from the due date for filing such Tax Return
(taking into account extensions validly obtained), and (iv) not file any such
Tax Return without first obtaining Seller's prior written consent (not to be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed). If Seller Representative and
Buyer are unable to resolve any such dispute at least 10 days prior to the
due date (including applicable extensions) for filing any such Buyer Return,
the dispute will be referred to the Accounting Expert for resolution in
accordance with the provisions of _Section 8.13_. For the avoidance of doubt,
nothing in this _Section 8.1_ shall permit Seller Representative to review (x)
any Tax Return of Parent or any of its Affiliates (other than a Group
Company) or (y) any Tax Return of a consolidated, combined, unitary, or
affiliated Tax group of which Parent or Buyer is a member, provided, however,
that if a Group Company joins such a consolidated, combined, unitary or
affiliated Tax group, then Buyer shall provide pro forma Tax Returns relating
to such Group Company for Seller Representative's review consistent with this
_Section 8.1(b)_.

  



  

   

-50-

 



    



  

8.2   _Straddle Periods_. For purposes of apportioning liability
for Taxes of a Group Company (other than Transfer Taxes and Vietnamese
Capital Transaction Taxes) in connection with any Straddle Period: (a) in the
case of Taxes based upon or related to income or receipts (including any
Taxes imposed on the Company under Section 951 and Section 951A of the Code
with respect to any Group Company that is a "controlled foreign corporation"
within the meaning of Section 957(a) of the Code), the amount of any such
Taxes allocable to the portion of the taxable period ending on the Closing
Date shall be determined based on an interim closing of the books of the
applicable Group Company as of the close of business on the Closing Date; and
(b) in the case of Taxes other than Taxes described in clause (a), the amount
of such Taxes allocable to the portion of the taxable period ending on the
Closing Date shall be the product of (i) the amount of such Taxes for the
entire period and (ii) a fraction the numerator of which is the number of
calendar days in the period ending with the Closing Date and the denominator
of which is the number of calendar days in the entire period; _provided_ ,
that (A) the amount of Taxes allocated to a Pre-Closing Tax Period shall
not be increased or otherwise adversely affected by any items, events or
transactions outside of the ordinary course of business occurring on the
Closing Date after the Closing or following the Closing Date, (B) all
deductions arising from the payment of Seller Transaction Expenses shall be
allocated exclusively to the portion of the Straddle Period ending on the
Closing Date and (C) any employer payroll Taxes arising with respect to a
Pre-Closing Tax Period that have been deferred pursuant to the CARES Act or
any other corresponding or similar provision of other Law with respect to
Taxes shall be allocated to the Pre-Closing Tax Period.

  



  

8.3   _Post-Closing Actions_. Unless (x) Buyer first obtains the
prior written consent of Seller Representative (not to be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned or delayed, which consent shall be deemed to be
unreasonably withheld if the action is required by applicable Law), (y)
permitted by _Section 8.1_ or (z) Buyer waives its right to indemnification
from Sellers under  _Section 11.2_ for any Losses arising as a result of such
action, following the Closing, Buyer shall not, and shall not permit any of
its Affiliates to: (a) file or amend or otherwise modify any Tax Return of a
Group Company relating to a Pre-Closing Tax Period or Straddle Period; (b)
make or change any Tax election or accounting method or practice with respect
to, or that has retroactive effect to, any Pre-Closing Tax Period of any
Group Company; (c) enter into any voluntary disclosure Tax program, Contract,
or arrangement with any Governmental Authority regarding any Taxes of any
Group Company for a Pre-Closing Tax Period or Straddle Period; or (d) make an
election pursuant to Section 338 of the Code (or similar provisions of state,
local or foreign Law) with respect to the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement.

  



  

   

-51-

 



    



  

8.4 _Amended Tax Returns_. As promptly as practicable following
the date hereof (and in any event prior to the Closing), Sellers shall (a)
file amended U.S. federal and applicable state income Tax Returns of the
Company for its taxable periods ending December 31, 2018 and December 31,
2019 (such Tax Returns, the " _Amended Tax Returns_ "), which Amended Tax
Returns (including any forms or schedules attached thereto) shall be updated
to reflect (i) any amounts that the Company was required to include in its
gross income under Section 951 of the Code or Section 951A of the Code (or any
similar provision of state or local Law) and any deductions available to the
Company under Section 250(a)(1)(B) of the Code (or any similar provision
of state or local Law), and (ii) any other changes that are necessary to
cause each Amended Tax Return to be substantially complete for purposes of
Section 6501(c)(8) of the Code (or any corresponding provision of state or
local Law), and (b) pay or cause to be paid all Taxes shown as due on each
such Amended Tax Return (including any penalties and interest payable
with respect to such Amended Tax Return). No fewer than 15 days prior to the
date of the filing of an Amended Tax Return, Seller (A) shall provide to
Buyer copies of the completed Amended Tax Return and (B) shall incorporate any
reasonable comments provided by Buyer with respect to the Amended Tax Return
(including any other changes that are necessary to cause each Amended Tax
Return to be substantially complete for purposes of Section 6501(c)(8) of the
Code (or any corresponding provision of state or local Law)). For the
avoidance of doubt, (x) any unpaid expenses incurred by the Company in
connection with the preparation of the Amended Tax Returns shall be included
in the calculation of Seller Transaction Expenses and (y) if a Governmental
Authority ultimately determines that the amount of Taxes payable by the
Company (including Taxes arising under Section 951 or Section 951A of the
Code) with respect to its taxable year ending on December 31, 2018 or December
31, 2019, as the case may be, exceeds the amount of Taxes shown as due on the
Amended Tax Return, the amount of Losses incurred by the Buyer Indemnitees as
a result of such determination shall be treated as Excluded Taxes that are
indemnifiable pursuant to _Section 11.2_.

  



  

8.5 _Refunds_. Following the Closing, Buyer shall cause the
Group Companies to pay to Seller Representative for further distribution
to Sellers any and all refunds (or any credits in lieu thereof) of Taxes
(including interest thereon if any received from any Governmental Authority
with respect to such refund) that are attributable to a Pre-Closing Tax Period
and that are received by Buyer or any of its Affiliates (including, following
the Closing, the Group Companies) after the Closing Date (less any reasonable
expenses and Taxes incurred by Buyer or any of its Affiliates (including,
following the Closing, the Group Companies) in receiving such refund) (a "
_Tax Refund_ "), except to the extent that such Tax Refund (a) arises as the
result of a carryback of a loss or other Tax benefit from a Post-Closing Tax
Period or (b) was reflected as an asset in the final calculation of Closing
Working Capital. Any Tax Refund shall be paid to Seller Representative no more
than 10 days following the receipt thereof by Buyer or any of its Affiliates.
Seller Representative shall be entitled to pursue, at Sellers' sole cost and
expense, any Tax Refunds; _provided_ , that: (i) Seller Representative shall
permit Buyer to review each claim for refund, amended Tax Return or other
filing required to obtain any Tax Refund at least 15 days prior to filing;
(ii) notwithstanding anything in clause (iii) of this proviso to the contrary,
neither Buyer nor any of its Affiliates (nor any of their respective
employees or officers) shall be required to sign or file any claim for
refund, amended Tax Return, or other filing described in clause (i) of this
proviso if a position taken on such claim for refund, amended Tax Return or
other filing is not supportable at a more-likely-than-not or higher level of
comfort; and (iii) to the extent that the assistance of Buyer or any of its
Affiliates (including, following the Closing, the Group Companies)
is necessary in order to obtain any Tax Refund, at Seller Representative's
written request (and at the sole expense of Sellers), Buyer shall, and shall
cause its Affiliates (including, following the Closing, the Group Companies)
to, assist Seller Representative in obtaining any Tax Refund (except, for the
avoidance of doubt, (A) preparing any data or other information used in
connection with a claim for refund, amended Tax Return or other filing or (B)
reviewing or analyzing any data or other information used in connection with
a claim for refund, amended Tax Return or other filing, which, in each case,
shall be the responsibility of Seller Representative). If a Tax Refund that
was previously paid to Seller Representative pursuant to this _Section 8.5_
is subsequently reduced, disallowed or otherwise required to be returned to a
Governmental Authority, any amounts due by Buyer or any of its Affiliates
(including, following the Closing, the Group Companies) as a result of the
reduction or disallowance of such Tax Refund shall be treated as Excluded
Taxes for which Sellers shall be responsible under _Section 11.2_.

  



  

   

-52-

 



    



  

8.6   _Contests_.

  



  

(a) Following the Closing, Buyer or the Group Companies shall
promptly notify Seller Representative in writing of the receipt of any
written proposed assessment or the commencement of any Tax audit, demand,
claim or administrative or judicial proceeding that relates to the Taxes of
any Group Company (a " _Contest_ "), if: (i) such Contest relates to a Pre-
Closing Tax Period or Straddle Period; and (ii) such Contest, if determined
adversely to the taxpayer or after the lapse of time, could be grounds
for indemnification under _Section 11.2_; _provided_ , that the failure to
so notify Seller Representative of the receipt of the proposed written
assessment or the commencement of any Contest shall not relieve Sellers of
their indemnification obligations under _Section 11.2_, unless (and then
solely to the extent that) Sellers were actually and materially prejudiced
by such failure.

  



  

(b)  In the case of any Contest that relates to any Pre-Closing
Tax Period (other than a Straddle Period), except (x) as otherwise provided
in _Section 8.6(e)_ or (y) if Sellers would not be liable for any Losses
arising as a result of such Contest under  _Section 11.2_ (taking into
account the RWI Policy and the limitations on indemnification set forth in
_ARTICLE 11_ ), Seller Representative shall have the right, at Sellers' sole
cost and expense, to elect to control the conduct of such Contest; 
_provided_ , that: (i) Seller Representative shall acknowledge in writing, on
behalf of Sellers, the indemnification obligations of Sellers with respect to
the full amount of any Losses under _Section 11.2_ (other than Losses
attributable to Taxes to the extent included in the final calculation of
Closing Indebtedness or Closing Working Capital or to the extent Buyer
recovers for all such Losses under the RWI Policy) that may arise as a result
of the Contest before Seller Representative may control such Contest; (ii)
Seller Representative shall elect to control such Contest within the time
period set forth in _Section 8.6(d)_; (iii) Seller Representative shall
diligently defend the Group Companies in connection with such Contest (
_provided_ , for the avoidance of doubt, Seller Representative's decision to
settle such Contest shall not be deemed to constitute a failure to diligently
defend the Group Companies in connection with a Contest); (iv) Buyer shall be
entitled to participate (at its own expense) in such Contest; (v) Seller
Representative shall provide Buyer with a timely and reasonably detailed
account of each phase of such Contest; (vi) Seller Representative shall
consult with Buyer and offer Buyer an opportunity to comment before
submitting any written materials prepared or furnished in connection with
such Contest, and shall consider in good faith any reasonable
comments provided by Buyer; and (vii) Seller Representative shall not settle
such Contest without first obtaining Buyer's prior written consent (which
consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned) if such
settlement could increase the Taxes of Buyer or any of its Affiliates
(including, following the Closing, the Group Companies) in a Post-Closing Tax
Period.

  



  

   

-53-

 



    



  

(c)  Buyer shall control any Contest if (i) such Contest relates
to a Pre-Closing Tax Period and Buyer is entitled to control such Contest in
accordance with _Section 8.6(e)_ or (ii) such Contest relates to a Straddle
Period; _provided_ that, unless Sellers would not be liable for any Losses
arising as a result of such Contest under _Section 11.2_ (taking into
account the RWI Policy and the limitations on indemnification set forth in
_ARTICLE 11_ ): (A) Buyer shall provide the Seller Representative with a
timely and reasonably detailed account of each phase of such Contest; (B)
Buyer shall consult with Seller Representative before taking any significant
action in connection with such Contest; (C) Buyer shall consult with Seller
Representative and offer Seller Representative an opportunity to comment
before submitting any written materials prepared or furnished in connection
with such Contest, and shall consider in good faith any reasonable comments
provided by Seller Representative; (D) Seller Representative shall be
entitled to participate (at Sellers' own expense) in such Contest; and (E)
Buyer shall not settle such Contest without Seller Representative's prior
written consent (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, delayed or
conditioned).

  



  

(d)  If Seller Representative elects to direct a Contest
described in _Section 8.6(b)_, Seller Representative shall, within 20 days
of receipt of the notice described in _Section 8.6(a)_ , notify Buyer of its
intent to do so; _provided_ ,  _however_ , that, if either applicable Law or
the applicable Governmental Authority requires a Group Company to respond
(either orally or in writing) within such 20 day period, Buyer shall (i)
notify Seller Representative of the obligation to respond as promptly as
possible and (ii) if Seller Representative does not elect to control the claim
prior to the time that the response is due, cause the applicable Group
Company to timely respond to the Governmental Authority; _provided_ ,
_further_ , that prior to responding to the applicable Governmental
Authority, Buyer shall consult with Seller Representative and offer Seller
Representative a reasonable opportunity to comment on the proposed response.

  



  

(e)  Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary,
Buyer shall have the exclusive right to control any Contest if: (i) such
Contest could not be grounds for indemnification pursuant to _Section 11.2_;
(ii) the assumption of the defense by Seller Representative would cause a
Buyer Indemnitee to lose coverage under the RWI Policy; (iii) Seller
Representative fails to (A) acknowledge the indemnification obligations of
Sellers with respect to the full amount of any Losses (other than

the operations of the Group Companies and that was controlled or owned (in
all cases, either individually or acting together) by any Seller or any of its
respective Affiliates and not included in the assets owned by the Group
Companies, such Seller will (or will cause its Affiliate to), within five
Business Days of the request of Buyer, convey to the Group Company as
designated by Buyer, at no additional cost to Buyer, all of the rights,
title and interests of such Person (or relevant Affiliate) in relation to
such asset. Each Seller further agrees that all such assets so transferred to
a Group Company pursuant to this _Section 13.7_ will be free and clear of any
Encumbrances (other than Permitted Encumbrances), and that each
representation, warranty, covenant and indemnity of Sellers in this Agreement
that applied to the tangible property also will apply to such asset.

  



  

13.8   _Entire Agreement_. This Agreement and the Ancillary Documents
are intended by the Parties as a final expression of their agreement and
intended to be a complete and exclusive statement of the agreement and
understanding of the Parties in respect of the subject matter contained
herein and therein. There are no restrictions, promises, warranties or
undertakings, other than those set forth or referred to herein or therein.
This Agreement and the Ancillary Documents supersede all prior agreements
and understandings between the Parties with respect to such subject matter.
The Parties have voluntarily agreed to define their rights, liabilities and
obligations respecting the subject matter hereof exclusively in contract
pursuant to the express terms and provisions of this Agreement and the
Ancillary Documents, and the Parties expressly disclaim that they are owed any
duties or are entitled to any remedies not expressly set forth in this
Agreement or the Ancillary Documents. Each Party further acknowledges that,
in entering into this Agreement, it has not relied on, and shall have no
right or remedy in respect of, and hereby expressly disclaims, any statement,
representation, assurance or warranty (whether made negligently or innocently)
other than as expressly set out in this Agreement and the Ancillary
Documents.

  



  

13.9 _Amendments and Waivers_. Except as expressly permitted
hereunder, any term or provision of this Agreement may be amended,
modified, supplemented or waived if, and only if, such amendment,
modification or waiver is in writing and signed, in the case of an amendment
or modification, by Buyer and Seller Representative (and, for the avoidance of
doubt, not an email or series of emails), or in the case of a waiver, by the
Party against whom the waiver is to be effective. No failure or delay by
any Party in exercising any right, power or privilege hereunder shall operate
as a waiver thereof nor shall any single or partial exercise thereof preclude
any other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right,
power or privilege.

13.10   _Assignment; No Third Party Beneficiary_. The rights of a Party
under this Agreement (other than its right to receive payment) shall not be
assignable by such Party without the written consent of the other Parties.
This Agreement shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the Parties
and their respective successors and permitted assigns. Nothing in this
Agreement, expressed or implied, is intended or shall be construed to confer
upon any Person other than the Parties any right, remedy or claim under or by
reason of this Agreement; _provided_ , that the Buyer Indemnitees are intended
to be third party beneficiaries of _ARTICLE 11_. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, Buyer and, after the Closing, the Group Companies, shall be
permitted to assign this Agreement and their rights and obligations
hereunder, in whole or in part, without the prior written consent of the
other Parties to (a) an Affiliate of such Person, (b) such Person's financing
sources as collateral security and (c) in connection with a sale of all or
substantially all of the assets or business of such Person; _provided_ that no
such assignment shall relieve Buyer of any of its obligations hereunder.

  



  

13.11   _Partial Invalidity_. Wherever possible, each provision hereof
shall be interpreted in such a manner as to be effective and valid under Law.
In case any one or more of the provisions contained herein shall, for any
reason, be held to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable in any respect, such
provision or provisions shall be ineffective to the extent, but only to the
extent, of such invalidity, illegality or unenforceability, without
invalidating the remainder of such invalid, illegal or unenforceable
provision or provisions or any other provisions hereof, unless such a
construction would be unreasonable. If any provision of this Agreement is so
broad as to be unenforceable, the provision shall be interpreted to be only so
broad as would be enforceable.

  



  

13.12   _Execution in Counterparts_. This Agreement and each document to
be executed and delivered pursuant to this Agreement (including the Ancillary
Documents) may be executed and delivered in counterpart signature pages
executed and delivered via email with scan attachment, or any electronic
signature complying with the U.S. federal ESIGN Act of 2000 (including
DocuSign) shall be as effective as delivery of a manually executed
counterpart of this Agreement, except as otherwise prohibited by Law in
the case of documents to be filed with Governmental Authorities.

  



  

13.13   _Interpretation_.

  



  

(a)  Each Party acknowledges that it has consulted with, or has been
afforded the opportunity to consult with, counsel of its own choosing in
connection with the drafting, negotiation and execution of this Agreement and
that it enters into this Agreement of its own free will and as its
independent act. The language used in this Agreement has been chosen
collectively by the Parties to express their mutual intent, so no Party shall
be deemed the drafter of this Agreement. No rule of construction shall be
applied against or in favor of any Party, and the Parties all waive any
statute, principle or rule of law to the contrary.

(b)   The Disclosure Schedule shall be construed with and as an
integral part of this Agreement to the same extent as if it were set forth
verbatim herein. Neither the specification of any dollar amount in any
representation or warranty contained in this Agreement nor the inclusion of
any specific item in the Disclosure Schedule is intended to imply that such
amount, or higher or lower amounts, or the item so included or other items,
are or are not material, and no Party shall use the fact of the setting forth
of any such amount or the inclusion of any such item in any dispute or
controversy between the Parties as to whether any obligation, item or matter
not described herein or included in the Disclosure Schedule is or is not
material for purposes of this Agreement. Unless this Agreement provides
otherwise, neither the specification of any item or matter in any
representation or warranty contained in this Agreement nor the inclusion of
any specific item in the Disclosure Schedule is intended to imply that such
item or matter, or other items or matters, are or are not in the ordinary
course of business, and no Party shall use the fact of the setting forth or
the inclusion of any such item or matter in any dispute or controversy between
the Parties as to whether any obligation, item or matter not described herein
or included in the Disclosure Schedule is or is not in the ordinary course of
business for purposes of this Agreement. Each Section in the Disclosure
Schedule shall be deemed to qualify the corresponding Section of this
Agreement and any other Section of this Agreement to which the application of
such disclosure is reasonably apparent on the face of such disclosure. It is
specifically acknowledged that the Disclosure Schedule may expressly provide
exceptions to a particular Section of _ARTICLE 3_ or _ARTICLE 4_
notwithstanding that the Section does not state "except as set forth in
_Section  ' '_ of the Disclosure Schedule" or words of similar effect.
Any Contract that is referred to in the Disclosure Schedule shall be deemed
incorporated in its entirety as if included in the Disclosure
Schedule verbatim to the extent made available to Buyer.

Group Companies_.

  



  

(a)  Each Party agrees, on its own behalf and on behalf of its
Affiliates and Representatives, that SMRH may serve as counsel to Sellers, on
the one hand, and any Group Company, on the other hand, in connection with the
negotiation, preparation, execution and delivery of this Agreement and the
Ancillary Documents and the consummation of the Transactions, and that,
following consummation of the Transactions, SMRH may serve as counsel to
Sellers or their respective Representatives (including, for the avoidance
of doubt, Seller Representative), in connection with any Action arising out
of or relating to this Agreement, the Ancillary Documents and the
Transactions notwithstanding such prior representation of either of the Group
Companies, and each Party consents thereto and waives any actual or potential
conflict of interest arising therefrom, and each Party shall cause its
Affiliates (including, in the case of Buyer after the Closing, the Group
Companies) and Representatives to consent to waive any actual or potential
conflict of interest arising from such representation.

Affiliates' respective successors and assigns, hereby irrevocably
and unconditionally acknowledges and agrees that, other than in the case of
Fraud, all attorney-client privileged communications between any Seller,

acknowledged by Buyer and the Group Companies that such excess remitted
payments belong to Sellers.

Sellers hereby designate Yongki Yi to serve as the sole and
exclusive representative of Sellers (" _Seller Representative_ ") from and
after the Closing Date with respect to those provisions of this Agreement or
the Escrow Agreement that contemplate action by Seller Representative;
_provided_ , _however_ , that if Yongki Yi at any time is unable, due to

(c)  Service by Seller Representative shall be without compensation

Representative as specifically provided herein and the indemnification
provided in _Section 13.16(d)_ of this Agreement.

  



  

(d)  Whether or not the Transactions are consummated, each Seller

directors/managers, employees and agents, based on each Seller's Pro Rata
Share, from and against any and all actions, causes of Action, suits, losses,
liabilities, damages and expenses (including reasonable legal fees and
expenses of counsel to Seller Representative), except to the extent that any
thereof result from the applicable Seller's own gross negligence or willful
misconduct, as determined by a court of competent jurisdiction. Without
limitation of the foregoing, each Seller shall reimburse Seller Representative
upon demand for such Seller's Pro Rata Share of any costs or out-of-pocket
expenses (including reasonable legal fees and expenses of counsel to Seller
Representative) incurred by Seller Representative in connection with the
preparation, execution, delivery, administration, modification, amendment or
enforcement (whether through negotiations, legal proceedings or otherwise) of,
or legal advice in respect of rights or responsibilities, or any document
contemplated by or referred to herein, to the extent that
Seller Representative is not reimbursed through the Reserve Account or
otherwise by Sellers for such expenses. This _Section 13.16(d)_  shall
survive the Closing, expiration or termination of the Agreement and the
resignation or replacement of Seller Representative.

  



  

(e)  Buyer shall be entitled to rely upon any actions taken by
Seller Representative as the duly authorized action of Seller Representative
on behalf of each Seller with respect to any matters set forth in this
Agreement or the Escrow Agreement.

  



  

13.17   _Enforcement of Agreement_. Each Party acknowledges and agrees
that the other Parties would be irreparably damaged if any of the provisions
of this Agreement are not performed in accordance with their specific terms
and that any breach of this Agreement by any Party may not be adequately
compensated by monetary damages alone. Accordingly, in the event of a breach
by any Party of any provision of this Agreement, in addition to any other
legal or equitable remedy that the other Parties may have, the Parties shall
be entitled to enforce any provision of this Agreement by a decree of specific
performance and to temporary, preliminary and permanent injunctive relief to
prevent breaches or threatened breaches of any provision of this Agreement.
Further, the Parties hereby waive any claim or defense that there is an
adequate remedy at law for such breaches or threatened breaches. Seeking
specific performance or temporary, preliminary or permanent injunctive relief
shall not be an election of remedies and shall not limit the obligation of
the Party breaching or threatening breach to indemnify under this Agreement.

13.18   _Parent Company Guaranty_.

  



  

(a)  To induce Sellers to enter into this Agreement, Parent hereby
agrees to cause Buyer to perform all of its obligations as and when due under
this Agreement and the Ancillary Documents and hereby further absolutely,
unconditionally and irrevocably guarantees to Sellers the due and punctual
payment by, and performance and discharge of, all of the obligations of Buyer
pursuant to this Agreement and the Ancillary Documents (the " _Guaranteed
Buyer Obligations_ "). The liability of Parent as aforesaid shall not be
released or diminished by any arrangements or alterations of terms (whether of
this Agreement or any other agreement or certificate contemplated hereby) or
any forbearance, neglect or delay in seeking performance of the payment
obligations hereby imposed or any granting of time for such payment. Parent
hereby waives all defenses otherwise available to a guarantor or surety other
than Fraud, payment and performance in full, and accord and satisfaction
pursuant to a mutually executed instrument, and further waives presentment,
demand of performance, any right to require any proceeding first against
Buyer, protest, notice and all demands whatsoever in connection with the
performance of its obligations hereunder. Parent agrees that it will not, and
will cause its Affiliates not to, institute or maintain any Action asserting,
or asserting as a defense that, its guaranty hereunder is illegal, invalid or
unenforceable in accordance with its terms.

  



  

(b)  This guarantee is to be a continuing security of Sellers for
the Guaranteed Buyer Obligations that may be owed by Buyer. This guarantee
shall continue to be effective or be reinstated, as the case may be, if at any
time Buyer fails to perform or pay any of the Guaranteed Buyer Obligations.
This is a guarantee of performance and payment and not of collection only.

  



  

(c)  Parent hereby makes, as of the date hereof and as of the
Closing Date, the representations and warranties set forth in _Section 5.1_
(Organization and Power), _Section 5.2_ (Authority and Enforceability),
_Section 5.3_ (Conflicts) and _Section 5.4_ (No Litigation) as to itself.

  



  

(d)  Each Party acknowledges and agrees that this _Section 13.18_
is an integral and essential part of the Transactions and no Party would have
entered into this Agreement, nor would it have entered into the Ancillary
Documents, without the benefit of the guaranty set forth in this _Section
13.18_, and each Party has relied on the execution of this Agreement by
Parent as set forth on this signature page hereto in that regard. Parent
acknowledges that it will receive substantial direct and indirect benefits
from the Transactions.
