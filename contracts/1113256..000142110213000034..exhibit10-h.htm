order to satisfy any of the conditions of Closing set forth herein. 



Section 7.7 Entire Agreement. This Agreement sets forth all of the premises,

with respect to the subject matter hereof, and shall supersede all prior

ARTICLE VIII



Section 8.1 Dispute Resolution. The Parties shall make their best efforts in
order to settle any disputes arising out of the execution, performance or
interpretation of this Agreement by means of bona fide negotiations. If,
within thirty (30) days of the receipt by any Party of a notice of dispute
from any other Parties (the "Notice of Dispute"), the Parties do not mutually
agree on a solution, then the dispute shall be settled by final and binding
arbitration, as provided below.

Section 8.1.1. Arbitration. The arbitration shall be conducted in accordance
with the rules of the CCBC, in force at the date of the request for
arbitration. The court of arbitration will be composed by three arbitrators,
of which one will be appointed by the requesting Party(ies) within 20 days of
the request for arbitration, one by the requested Party(ies) within 20 days of
the request for arbitration, and the third, who shall chair the arbitral
tribunal, will be chosen by the arbitrators appointed by the two Parties,
within 20 days as of the appointment of the later-appointed arbitrator, or in
case the arbitrators are incapable to appoint the third arbitrator, by the
president of CCBC. Any arbitrator not timely appointed shall be appointed by
the CCBC. The seat of the arbitration will be the city of Sao Paulo, State of
Sao Paulo, Brazil. The official language of the arbitration will be English.
The award will be pronounced in the Portuguese language and the arbitrators
shall not decide based on the equity principle. The arbitration award will be
final and binding on the Parties and their successors, and may be executed in
any court having jurisdiction thereof. The costs of the arbitration, including
attorney's fees, shall be borne by the losing Party(ies), except if the
Parties agree or the arbitrators decide differently. In case that the
arbitration decision is partially favorable to any or all of the Parties
involved in the arbitration, the arbitrators shall allocate the arbitration
costs between the losing Parties. The Parties waive any right of appeal.
Notwithstanding the provisions above, the Parties elect the Courts of the city
of Sao Paulo, State of Sao Paulo, as the court with exclusive jurisdiction to
obtain provisional reliefs, including preliminary injunctions and interim
measures, to protect rights prior to the confirmation of the arbitral
tribunal, as well as in other situations authorized by Law No. 9,307/96. Even
in cases in which a provisional relief has been requested or obtained, the
merit of the conflict shall always be decided by the arbitrators. The Parties
undertake not to disclose (and not to allow the disclosure of) any information
related to such arbitration (including information regarding its existence),
except if (i) the disclosure of such information is required by law or
regulation; (ii) the disclosure of such information is requested by a governmental authority or by
order of a court with competent jurisdiction; or (iii) such information are
made available to the general public by any means other than by disclosure by
the Parties or their respective affiliates. It is agreed that each Party may
disclose such information to its affiliates and representatives, and may
discuss such information with other parties and its representatives, limiting
the access to such information to the respective representatives that have the
need to examine them in good faith, and that have been informed by the
respective Party of the confidential nature of such information.















IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the Parties hereto execute this Agreement in five (5)
identical counterparts, along with the undersigned two (2) witnesses.
