from time to time after the Effective Time, any dividends or other
distributions, if any, to which the holders of Eligible Shares may be entitled
pursuant to _Section 2.2(c)_ with both a record and payment date after the
Effective Time and prior to the surrender of such Eligible Shares or pursuant
to _Section 5.10(c)_.

 



6  Such shares of Parent Common Stock, cash in lieu of any fractional shares
payable pursuant to _Section 2.2(e)_ and the amount of any dividends or other
distributions deposited with the Exchange Agent pursuant to this _Section
2.2(a)_ are referred to collectively in this Agreement as the " _Exchange
Fund_ ". The Exchange Fund shall not be used for any purpose other than for
the purpose provided for in this Agreement and shall be held in trust for the
benefit of the holders of Eligible Shares. In the event that the Exchange Fund
shall be insufficient to make the payments contemplated by this _Section_ __ _
2.2_, Parent shall promptly deposit, or cause to be deposited, additional
funds with the Exchange Agent in an amount sufficient to make such payments.
Funds made available to the Exchange Agent shall be invested by the Exchange
Agent, as directed by Parent, in short-term obligations of, or short-term
obligations fully guaranteed as to principal and interest by, the United
States of America with maturities of no more than thirty (30) days or in
commercial paper obligations rated P1 or A-1 or better by Moodys Investors
Service, Inc. or Standard and Poors Corporation, pending payment thereof by the
Exchange Agent to the holders of Eligible Shares pursuant to this  _Section_
__ _ 2.2_; _provided_ , that no investment of such deposited funds shall
relieve Parent, the Surviving Company or the Exchange Agent from promptly
making the payments required by this  _Section_ __ _ 2.2_, and following any
losses from any such investment, Parent shall promptly provide additional
funds to the Exchange Agent, for the benefit of the holders of Eligible
Shares, in the amount of such losses (but only to the extent such losses
result in the Exchange Fund being less than the amounts that remain payable to
the holders of Eligible Shares under this _Section_ __ _ 2.2_), which
additional funds will be held and disbursed in the same manner as funds
initially deposited with the Exchange Agent to make the payments contemplated
by this _Section_ __ _ 2.2_. Any interest or income produced by such
investments will be payable to Merger Sub or Parent, as Parent directs.
Parent shall direct the Exchange Agent to hold the Exchange Fund for the
benefit of the former holders of Eligible Shares and to make payments from the
Exchange Fund in accordance with this _Section_ __ _ 2.2_.

 

(b) _Exchange Procedures_.

 

(i) Promptly after the Effective Time (and in any event within five Business
Days thereafter), the Surviving Company shall cause the Exchange Agent to
mail to each holder of record of Eligible Shares that are evidenced by a
Company Certificate notice advising such holders of the effectiveness of the
Merger, including (A) appropriate transmittal materials specifying that
delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to Company
Certificates shall pass, only upon delivery of Company Certificates (or
affidavits of loss in lieu of Company Certificates, as provided in _Section_
__ _ 2.7_) to the Exchange Agent (the " _Letter of Transmittal_ "), and (B)
instructions for surrendering Company Certificates (or affidavits of loss in
lieu of Company Certificates, as provided in _Section_ __ _ 2.7_) to the
Exchange Agent in exchange for the Merger Consideration, cash in lieu of
fractional shares of Parent Common Stock, if any, to be issued or paid in
consideration therefor, and any dividends or other distributions, in each
case, to which such holders are entitled pursuant to the terms of this
Agreement. Payment of the Merger Consideration, cash in lieu of fractional
shares of Parent Common Stock, if any, to be issued or paid in consideration
therefor and any dividends or other distributions, in each case to which such
holders are entitled pursuant to the terms of this Agreement with respect to
Company Book-Entry Shares shall be made promptly following the Effective Time
without any action on the part of the person in whose name such Company Book-
Entry Shares are registered.

 



7 (ii) No interest will be paid or accrued on any amount payable upon due
surrender of Eligible Shares, and any Company Certificate or ledger entry
relating to Company Book-Entry Shares formerly representing shares of Company
Common Stock that have been so surrendered shall be cancelled by the Exchange
Agent.

 

(iii) In the event of a transfer of ownership of certificated Eligible Shares
that is not registered in the transfer records of the Company, the number of
whole shares of Parent Common Stock that such holder is entitled to receive
pursuant to _Section 2.1(a)_, together with an amount (if any) in immediately
available funds (or, if no wire transfer instructions are provided, a check,
and in each case, after deducting any required Tax withholdings as provided in
_Section 2.2(h)_ ) of cash in lieu of fractional shares to be paid upon due
surrender of the Company Certificate pursuant to _Section 2.2(e)_ and
any dividends or other distributions in respect thereof in accordance with
_Section 2.2(c)_ or _Section 5.10(c)_ , may be issued or paid to such a
transferee if the Company Certificate formerly representing such Eligible
Shares is presented to the Exchange Agent, accompanied by all documents
required to evidence and effect such transfer and to evidence that any
applicable transfer and other similar Taxes have been paid, in each case, in
form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the Exchange Agent and the
Surviving Company. Payment of the Merger Consideration (and any cash in lieu
of fractional shares or dividends or other distributions payable thereon) with
respect to Company Book-Entry Shares shall only be made to the Person in
whose name such Company Book-Entry Shares are registered in the stock transfer
books of the Company. Until surrendered as contemplated by this _Section
2.2(b)_ , each Company Certificate and Company Book-Entry Share shall be
deemed at any time at or after the Effective Time to represent only the right
to receive the Merger Consideration in accordance with this _Article II_,
including any amount payable in cash in lieu of fractional shares in
accordance with _Section 2.2(e)_ , and any dividends or other distributions
in accordance with _Section 2.2(c)_ or _Section 5.10(c)_ , in each case
without interest.

 

(c) _Distributions with Respect to Unexchanged Shares_. Whenever a dividend or
other distribution is authorized by the Board of Directors of Parent and
declared by Parent in respect of Parent Common Stock, the record date for
which is after the Effective Time, that declaration shall include dividends or
other distributions in respect of all shares issuable pursuant to this
Agreement. With respect to Eligible Shares represented by a Company
Certificate, no dividends or other distributions in respect of Parent Common
Stock shall be paid to any holder of any unsurrendered Eligible Share until
the Company Certificate (or affidavit of loss in lieu of the Company
Certificate as provided in _Section_ __ _ 2.7_) is surrendered for exchange
in accordance with this _Article II_. Subject to applicable Laws, following
such surrender, there shall be issued or paid to the holder of record of the
whole shares of Parent Common Stock issued in exchange for Eligible Shares in
accordance with this _Article II_ , without interest, (i) at the time of such
surrender, the dividends or other distributions with a record date after the
Effective Time theretofore payable with respect to such whole shares of Parent
Common Stock and not paid and (ii) at the appropriate payment date, the
dividends or other distributions payable with respect to such whole shares of
Parent Common Stock with a record date after the Effective Time but with a
payment date subsequent to surrender.

 



8 (d) _Transfers_.

 

(i) From and after the Effective Time, there shall be no transfers on the
stock transfer books of the Company of the shares of Company Common Stock
that were outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time. From and after
the Effective Time, the holders of Company Certificates or Company Book-Entry
Shares outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall cease to have
any rights with respect to such shares of Company Common Stock, except as
otherwise provided in this Agreement or by applicable Law. If, after the
Effective Time, Company Certificates or Company Book-Entry Shares are
presented to the Surviving Company for any reason, they shall be cancelled
and exchanged as provided in this Agreement.

(ii) From and after the Partnership Merger Effective Time, there shall be no
transfers on the transfer books of the Company OP of the partnership interests
of the Company OP that were outstanding immediately prior to the Partnership
Merger Effective Time. From and after the Partnership Merger Effective Time,
the holders of partnership interests of the Company OP outstanding immediately
prior to the Partnership Merger Effective Time shall cease to have any rights
with respect to such partnership interests, except as otherwise provided in
this Agreement or by applicable Law. If, after the Partnership Merger
Effective Time, certificates, if any, evidencing partnership interests of the
Company OP are presented to the Surviving Partnership for any reason, they
shall be cancelled as provided in this Agreement.

(e) _No Fractional Shares_. Notwithstanding any other provision of this
Agreement to the contrary, no fractional shares of Parent Common Stock shall
be issued upon the conversion of Eligible Shares pursuant to this Agreement.
Any holder of Eligible Shares otherwise entitled to receive a fractional share
of Parent Common Stock but for this _Section 2.2(e)_ shall be entitled to
receive, upon surrender of the applicable Eligible Shares, a cash payment,
without interest, in lieu of any fractional share, equal to the product
obtained by multiplying (i) the fractional share interest to which such
holder (after taking into account all shares of Company Common Stock held at
the Effective Time by such holder) would otherwise be entitled by (ii) the
closing price on the NASDAQ Global Select Market (" _NASDAQ_ "), as reported
in _The Wall Street Journal_ , for a share of Parent Common Stock on the last
trading day immediately preceding the Closing Date. No holder of Eligible
Shares shall be entitled by virtue of the right to receive cash in lieu of
fractional shares of Parent Common Stock described in this _Section 2.2(e)_ to
any dividends, voting rights or any other rights in respect of any fractional
share of Parent Common Stock. The payment of cash in lieu of fractional
shares of Parent Common Stock is not a separately bargained-for consideration
and solely represents a mechanical rounding-off of the fractions in
the exchange.

(f) _Termination of Exchange Fund_. Any portion of the Exchange Fund that
remains undistributed to holders of Eligible Shares on the first anniversary
of the Effective Time shall be delivered to Parent, upon demand, and any
former stockholders of the Company who have not theretofore complied with this
_Article II_ shall thereafter look only to Parent for delivery of any shares
of Parent Common Stock and any payment of cash and any dividends and other
distributions in respect thereof payable or issuable pursuant to _Section
2.1(a)_ , _Section 2.2(c)_ , _Section 2.2(e)_ and _Section 5.10(c)_ , in each
case, without any interest thereon and subject to applicable abandoned
property, escheat or similar Laws.

 



9 (g) _No Liability_. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the
contrary, none of the Surviving Company, Parent, the Exchange Agent or any
other Person shall be liable to any former holder of shares of Company Common
Stock for any amount properly delivered to a public official pursuant to
applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar Laws. Any portion of the
Exchange Fund that remains undistributed to the holders of Eligible Shares
immediately prior to the time at which the Exchange Fund would otherwise
escheat to, or become property of, any Governmental Entity, shall, to the
extent permitted by Law, become the property of Parent, free and clear of all
claims or interest of any Person previously entitled thereto.

 

(h) _Withholding_. Each of Parent, the Company, the Exchange Agent and the
Surviving Company shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from any payment
made pursuant to this Agreement such amounts as it is required by Law to
deduct and withhold with respect to the making of such payment. To the extent
an amount is so deducted and withheld, the amount withheld shall be treated
for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the Person in
respect of which such deduction and withholding was made.

Surviving Company shall consider or be advised that any deeds, bills of sale,

Section 2.4 _Treatment of Company Equity Awards_.

 

(a) _Company Stock Options_. As of the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger
and without any action on the part of the Parties or any holders thereof,
each option to purchase shares of Company Common Stock granted under the
Company Equity Plans (each, a " _Company Stock Option_ "), whether vested or
unvested, that is outstanding and unexercised as of immediately prior to the
Effective Time shall vest in full (if not already vested) and be assumed by
Parent and shall be converted into an option (a " _Parent Stock Option_ ") to
purchase a number of shares of Parent Common Stock equal to the
product (rounded down to the nearest whole share) of (i) the number of shares
of Company Common Stock subject to such Company Stock Option as of immediately
prior to the Effective Time and (ii) the Exchange Ratio, at an exercise price
per share of Parent Common Stock (rounded up to the nearest cent) equal to
the exercise price per share of Company Common Stock under such Company Stock
Option immediately prior to the Effective Time divided by the Exchange Ratio.
Except as otherwise provided in this _Section 2.4(a)_ , each Company Stock
Option assumed and converted into a Parent Stock Option pursuant to this
_Section 2.4(a)_ shall continue to have, and shall be subject to, the same
terms and conditions as applied to the corresponding Company Stock Option as
of immediately prior to the Effective Time. Notwithstanding the foregoing, (A)
in the case of any Company Stock Option to which Section 421 of the Code
applies as of the Effective Time (after taking into account the effect of any
accelerated vesting thereof, if applicable) by reason of its qualification
under Section 422 of the Code, the exercise price, the number of shares of
Parent Common Stock subject to such option and the terms and conditions of
exercise of such option shall be determined in a manner consistent with the
requirements of Section 424(a) of the Code and (B) in the case of any Company
Stock Option to which Section 421 of the Code does not apply as of
the Effective Time (after taking into account the effect of any accelerated
vesting thereof, if applicable), the exercise price, the number of shares of
Parent Common Stock subject to such option and the terms and conditions of
exercise of each Company Stock Option shall be determined in a manner
consistent with the requirements of Section 409A of the Code.

(b) _Company Restricted Stock Awards_. As of the Effective Time, by virtue of
the Merger and without any action on the part of the Parties or any holders
thereof, each outstanding share of Company Common Stock granted under the

restriction as of immediately prior to the Effective Time (each, a " _Company
Restricted Stock Award_ ") shall vest in full and shall, subject to _Section
2.2(h)_, 

 



11  be converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration and the
right, if any, to receive cash in lieu of fractional shares into which the
shares subject to such Company Restricted Stock Award have been converted in
the same manner as provided under _Section_ __ _ 2.1_ and _Section 2.2(e)_
and any dividends or other distributions pursuant to _Section 2.2(c)_ or

(c) _Company Restricted Stock Unit Awards_. As of the Effective Time, by
virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of the Parties or any

Stock granted under the Company Equity Plans (each, a " _Company
Restricted Stock Unit Award_ ") that is outstanding as of immediately prior
to the Effective Time shall vest in full (if not already vested) (it being
acknowledged that any Company Restricted Stock Unit Award subject to
performance-based vesting terms (each, a " _Company Performance Stock Unit
Award_ ") shall vest at the greater of (1) 100% of the target number of shares
of Company Common Stock subject to such Company Performance Stock Unit Award
as of immediately prior to the Effective Time and (2) the number of shares of
Company Common Stock subject to such Company Performance Stock Unit Award as
of immediately prior to the Effective Time that is eligible to be paid to the
holder based on actual performance as determined as of the last trading day
immediately prior to the Effective Time pursuant to the terms of the Company
Equity Plans and the award agreement entered into thereunder evidencing such
Company Performance Stock Unit Award). Each Company Restricted Stock Unit
Award shall be assumed by Parent and shall be converted into a stock unit
award with respect to a number of whole shares of Parent Common Stock (rounded
to the nearest whole share) (each, a " _Parent Restricted Stock Unit Award_
") equal to the product of (i) the number of shares of Company Common Stock
subject to such Company Restricted Stock Unit Award as of immediately prior to
the Effective Time and (ii) the Exchange Ratio. The amount of any
cash dividends or other distributions previously credited (but not paid) to
the holder thereof in respect of such Company Restricted Stock Unit Award
shall be paid to the holder thereof in cash within ten Business Days following
the Effective Time. Except as otherwise provided in this _Section 2.4(c)_ ,
each Company Restricted Stock Unit Award assumed and converted into a Parent
Restricted Stock Unit Award pursuant to this _Section 2.4(c)_ shall continue

vested) and be assumed by Parent and shall be converted into a stock unit
award with respect to a number of whole shares of Parent Common Stock

Award_ ") equal to the product of (i) the number of shares of Company Common
Stock subject to such Company Deferred Stock Unit Award as of immediately
prior to the Effective Time and (ii) the Exchange Ratio. Except as otherwise
provided in this _Section 2.4(d)_, each Company Deferred Stock Unit Award

this _Section 2.4(d)_ shall continue to have, and shall be subject to, the
same terms and conditions as applied to the corresponding Company Deferred
Stock Unit Award as of immediately prior to the Effective Time, and shall be
settled on the same settlement date or dates applicable to such Company
Deferred Stock Unit Award.

REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES

 

Section 3.1 _Representations and Warranties of the Company_. The following
representations and warranties by the Company are qualified in their entirety
by reference to the disclosures (x) in the Company SEC Documents (excluding
any disclosures under the captions "Risk Factors" or "Forward Looking
Statements" or any other disclosures contained therein to the extent they are
predictive, cautionary or forward-looking in nature) filed on or after August
17, 2015 and prior to the date hereof (and then (i) only to the extent that
the relevance of any disclosed event, item or occurrence in such Company SEC
Documents to a matter covered by a representation or warranty set forth in
this _Section_ __ _ 3.1_ is reasonably apparent on its face as to matters and
items which are the subject of such representation or warranty and (ii) other

_Section 3.1(b)_, which matters shall only be qualified by specific
disclosure in the corresponding section of the Company Disclosure Letter);

the Company represents and warrants to Parent and Merger Sub that:

 

(a) _Organization, Standing and Power_.

 

(i) The Company is a corporation duly organized, validly existing and in good
standing under the laws of the State of Delaware. The Company has the
requisite corporate power and authority to own, lease and operate its

except where the failure to have such corporate power or authority would not

Material Adverse Effect. Each Subsidiary of the Company is duly organized,
validly existing and in good standing under the laws of the jurisdiction of
its organization and has requisite corporate, partnership or limited
liability company (as the case may be) power and authority to own, lease and
operate its properties and assets and to carry on its business as presently
conducted, except where the failure to be so organized, validly existing or
in good standing, or to have such power or authority, would not reasonably be
expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Company Material Adverse
Effect. The Company and each of its Subsidiaries is duly qualified as
a foreign corporation or other entity to do business and is in good standing
in each jurisdiction where the ownership, leasing or operation of its
properties or assets or the nature of its activities makes such qualification
necessary, except for such failures to be so qualified or to be in good
standing as would not reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the
aggregate, a Company Material Adverse Effect. The Company has previously made
available to Parent true and complete copies of the articles or certificates
of incorporation, certificates of formation, charter, bylaws, limited
liability company agreements, certificates of partnership, bylaws, partnership
agreement or other similar organizational documents (" _Organizational
Documents_ "), as applicable, of the Company and its Significant Subsidiaries,
in each case as in effect as of the date hereof. The Companys Organizational
Documents are in full force and effect and the Company is not in violation of
any of its Organizational Documents. All issued and outstanding shares of
capital stock of, or other equity interests in the Company OP and any
Significant Subsidiary of the Company are wholly owned, directly or
indirectly, by the Company free and clear of all Liens (other than
limitations on transfer and other restrictions imposed by federal or state
securities Laws), and all shares of capital stock of, or other equity
interests in, each such Subsidiary of the Company have been duly authorized
and validly issued and are fully paid, nonassessable and free of preemptive
rights.

(ii) _Section 3.1(a)(ii)_ of the Company Disclosure Letter sets forth a true,
correct and complete list of each Subsidiary of the Company, together with the
jurisdiction of organization or incorporation, as the case may be, of each
such Subsidiary, and the status of such Subsidiary for U.S. federal income
tax purposes as a REIT, a "qualified REIT subsidiary" within the meaning of
Section 856(i)(2) of the Code, a "taxable REIT subsidiary" within the meaning
of Section 856(l) of the Code, a partnership, or an entity that is
disregarded as an entity separate from its owner under Treasury Regulations
Section 301.7701-3. The Organizational Documents of all Significant
Subsidiaries of the Company are in full force and effect and the Significant
Subsidiaries of the Company are not in violation of any of their respective
Organizational Documents in any material respect.

 



15 (iii) All issued and outstanding shares of capital stock of, or other equity
interests in, each Subsidiary of the Company (other than the Company OP and
any Significant Subsidiary of the Company, which are addressed in _clause (i)_
above) are wholly owned, directly or indirectly, by the Company free and clear
of all Liens (other than limitations on transfer and other restrictions
imposed by federal or state securities Laws), and all shares of capital stock
of, or other equity interests in, each such Subsidiary of the Company have
been duly authorized and validly issued and are fully paid, nonassessable and
free of preemptive rights.

warranty set forth in this _Section_ __ _ 3.2_ is reasonably apparent on its
face as to matters and items which are the subject of such representation or

Disclosure Letter_ "). Each disclosure set forth in the Parent Disclosure
Letter shall qualify the Section to which it corresponds and any other Section
to the extent the applicability of the disclosure to each other Section is

to the foregoing, Parent and Merger Sub, on a joint and several basis,
represent and warrant to the Company that:

(a)  _Organization, Standing and Power_.

(i) Parent is a corporation duly organized, validly existing and in good
standing under the laws of the State of Maryland. Parent has the requisite
corporate power and authority to own, lease and operate its properties and
assets and to carry on its business as presently conducted except where the
failure to have such corporate power or authority would not reasonably be
expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Parent Material Adverse
Effect. Merger Sub is a limited liability company duly organized, validly
existing and in good standing under the laws of the State of Delaware and has
requisite limited liability company power and authority to own, lease and
operate its properties and assets and to carry on its business as presently

in good standing under the laws of the jurisdiction of its organization and
has requisite corporate, partnership or limited liability company (as the case
may be) power and authority to

 



37  own, lease and operate its properties and assets and to carry on its
business as presently conducted, except where the failure to be so organized,
validly existing or in good standing, or to have such power or authority,
would not reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a
Parent Material Adverse Effect. Parent and each of its Subsidiaries is duly
qualified as a foreign corporation or other entity to do business and is in
good standing in each jurisdiction where the ownership, leasing or operation
of its properties or assets or the nature of its activities makes such
qualification necessary, except for such failures to be so qualified or to be
in good standing as would not reasonably be expected to have, individually or
in the aggregate, a Parent Material Adverse Effect. Parent has previously made
available to the Company true and complete copies of the Organizational
Documents, as applicable, of Parent, Merger Sub and its Significant
Subsidiaries, in each case as in effect as of the date hereof. Parents
Organizational Documents are in full force and effect, and Parent is not in
violation of any of its Organizational Documents. Merger Subs Organizational
Documents are in full force and effect, and Merger Sub is not in violation of
any of its Organizational Documents. All issued and outstanding shares of

indirectly, by Parent free and clear of all Liens (other than limitations on
transfer and other restrictions imposed by federal or state securities Laws),
and all shares of capital stock of, or other equity interests in, each such
Subsidiary of Parent have been duly authorized and validly issued and are
fully paid, nonassessable and free of preemptive rights (other than in the
case of the Parent OP, preemptive rights of the Parent OP GP).

(ii) _Section 3.2(a)(ii)_ of the Parent Disclosure Letter sets forth a true,
correct and complete list of each Subsidiary of Parent, together with the
jurisdiction of organization or incorporation, as the case may be, of each
such Subsidiary, and the status of such Subsidiary for U.S. federal income tax
purposes as a REIT, a "qualified REIT subsidiary" within the meaning of
Section 856(i)(2) of the Code, a "taxable REIT subsidiary" within the meaning
of Section 856(l) of the Code, a partnership, or an entity that is disregarded
as an entity separate from its owner under Treasury Regulations Section
301.7701-3. The Organizational Documents of all Significant Subsidiaries of
Parent are in full force and effect and the Significant Subsidiaries of Parent
are not in violation of any of their respective Organizational Documents in
any material respect.

(iii) All issued and outstanding shares of capital stock of, or other equity
interests in, each Subsidiary of Parent (other than the Parent OP and any
Significant Subsidiary of Parent, which are addressed in _clause (i)_ above)
are wholly owned, directly or indirectly, by Parent free and clear of all
Liens (other than limitations on transfer and other restrictions imposed by
federal or state securities Laws), and all shares of capital stock of, or
other equity interests in, each such Subsidiary of Parent have been duly
authorized and validly issued and are fully paid, nonassessable and free of
preemptive rights.

(iv) Parent (directly or indirectly) owns beneficially and of record all of
the outstanding limited liability company interests in Merger Sub and is the

(iii) Parent has established and maintains a system of internal control over
financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a15(f) and 15d15(f) of the

disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a15(e) and
15d15(e) of the Exchange Act) to provide reasonable assurance that all
information required to be disclosed by Parent in the reports that it files or
submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized
and reported within the time periods specified in the SECs rules and forms
and is accumulated and communicated to Parents management as appropriate to
allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure and (y) has disclosed,
based on its most recent evaluation of internal control over financial
reporting, to the Company, Parents outside auditors and the audit committee

financial reporting which are reasonably likely to adversely affect Parents
ability to record, process, summarize and report financial information and (2)
any fraud, whether or not material, that involves management or other
employees who have a significant role in Parents internal control over
financial reporting. Since December 31, 2014, any material change in internal
control over financial reporting required to be disclosed in any Parent SEC
Document has been so disclosed.

(iv) Since December 31, 2014, neither Parent nor any of its Subsidiaries nor,
to the knowledge of Parent, any Representative of Parent or any of its

obligations arising out of this Agreement or the transactions contemplated
hereby; (D) for future performance under any Contracts to which Parent or any
of its Subsidiaries is a party or bound; and (E) liabilities or obligations
that would not reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the

commitment to become a party to, any "off balance sheet arrangements" (as
defined in Item 303(a) of Regulation S-K of the SEC), where the result,

transaction involving, or material liabilities of, Parent or any Subsidiary of
Parent or any of their financial statements.

 

(e) _Information Supplied_. None of the information supplied or to be supplied
by Parent or Merger Sub for inclusion or incorporation by reference in (i)
the Form S-4 will, at the time the Form S-4 is filed with the SEC and at the
time it becomes effective under the Securities Act, contain any
untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact
required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not
misleading, or (ii) the Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus will, at the date of
mailing to stockholders and at the times of the meetings of stockholders to
be held in connection with the Merger, contain any untrue statement of a
material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein
or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of the
circumstances under which they were made, not misleading. The Form S-4 and the
Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus will comply as to form as to Parent and
Merger Sub in all material respects with the requirements of the Securities
Act, the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations of the SEC promulgated
thereunder. No representation or warranty is made by Parent or Merger Sub with
respect to statements made in the Form S-4 or the Joint Proxy
Statement/Prospectus or incorporated by reference therein based on information
supplied by the Company for inclusion or incorporation by reference in the

(f) _Compliance with Laws_. Parent and each of its Subsidiaries are in, and
have since December 31, 2014 been in, compliance with all Laws applicable to
any of them or their respective operations, except to the extent that failure
to comply would not reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the
aggregate, a Parent Material Adverse Effect. Neither Parent nor any of its
Subsidiaries has received any written notice since December 31, 2014,
asserting a failure to comply with any such Law, the subject of which written
notice has not been resolved, except for such failures as would not reasonably
be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Parent Material
Adverse Effect. Neither Parent nor any of its Subsidiaries nor, to

or any of its Subsidiaries has (i) used any corporate funds for any unlawful
contributions, gifts, entertainment or other unlawful expenses related to
political activity, (ii) made any unlawful payment to any foreign or domestic
government official or employee or (iii) made any unlawful bribe, rebate,

taken as a whole.

such), which have had or would reasonably be expected to have, individually or
in the aggregate, a Parent Material Adverse Effect. There is no Order of any
Governmental Entity or arbitrator outstanding against Parent or any of its
Subsidiaries or any of their respective properties or assets which have had or
would reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a

Legal Proceeding pending, or to the knowledge of Parent, threatened against
Parent or any of its Subsidiaries nor is there any Order against Parent or
any of its Subsidiaries, in each case, that would reasonably be expected to
prevent or materially impair or delay the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement.

caused to be filed) all Tax Returns required to have been filed by it (taking
into account any extensions actually received), and all such Tax Returns are

(aa) _Financing_.

(i) Parent has delivered to the Company true and complete copies of the
executed commitment letter (together with the term sheet and any other
annexes, exhibits, schedules and other attachments thereto), dated as of the
date hereof (the " _Debt Commitment Letter_ ") from the financial
institutions and other lenders (the " _Lenders_ ") identified therein,
pursuant to which the Lenders have committed, subject only to the terms and
subject to the conditions set forth therein, to lend the amounts set forth
therein (the " _Financing_ "). Parent has also delivered to the Company true
and complete copies of any fee letter (with only the fee amounts and pricing
caps (none of which individually or in the aggregate would reduce the amount
of the Financing or adversely affect the availability of the Financing or
delay or prevent the Closing or make the funding of the Financing less likely
to occur) redacted) relating to the Debt Commitment Letter (any such fee
letter, a " _Fee Letter_ ") and any engagement letters or other agreements
relating to the Financing.

(ii) As of the date hereof, the Debt Commitment Letter is in full force and
effect and has not been withdrawn, terminated or rescinded or, except as

modified) in any respect. The Debt Commitment Letter, in the form delivered to
the Company, is a legal, valid and binding obligation of Parent and, to the
knowledge of Parent, the other parties thereto, enforceable against such
parties in accordance with its terms (subject to the applicable Bankruptcy and

arrangements (except for any Fee Letters, engagement letters with respect to
the Financing and any other agreements, each of which have been delivered to
the Company in accordance with the provisions of this _Section 3.2(aa)_ )
relating to the Debt Commitment Letter. No event has occurred which, with or
without notice, lapse of time or both, would constitute a default or breach on
the part of Parent under any term, or a failure of any condition, of the Debt
Commitment Letter or otherwise result in any portion of the Financing
contemplated thereby being unavailable at the Closing. Assuming the accuracy
of the representations and warranties set forth in _Section_ __ _ 3.1_, the
satisfaction of the conditions precedent to Parents obligations hereunder and
the performance in all material respects by the Company of its obligations
under this Agreement, Parent (A) has no reason to believe that it would not be
able to satisfy on a timely basis any term or condition of the Debt Commitment
Letter required to be satisfied by it and (B) is not aware of any fact,
occurrence or condition that makes any of the assumptions or statements set
forth in the Debt Commitment Letter inaccurate or that would reasonably be
expected to cause the Debt Commitment Letter to be terminated or ineffective.
Parent has fully paid any and all commitment fees or other fees required by
the Debt Commitment Letter that were due to be paid on or before the date of
this Agreement. There are no conditions precedent or other contingencies
related to the funding or investing, as applicable, of the full amount of the
Financing, other than as expressly set forth in the Debt Commitment Letter.

Representations and Warranties_. Each of Parent and Merger Sub has conducted

access to personnel, properties, premises and records of the Company and the
Subsidiaries of the Company for such purposes. In entering into this
Agreement, each of Parent and Merger Sub has not been induced by and has not

implied, made by the Company, any of its Subsidiaries, or any of their
respective affiliates, shareholders, controlling persons, trustees or
Representatives that are not expressly set forth in _Section_ __ _ 3.1_ of
this Agreement, whether or not such representations, warranties or statements
were made in writing or orally. Except for the representations and warranties
expressly set forth in _Section_ __ _ 3.1_ of this Agreement, (a) the Company
does not make, and has not made, any representations or warranties relating
to itself or its business or otherwise in connection with the Mergers, (b) no
Person has been authorized by the Company to make any representation or
warranty relating to itself or its business or otherwise in connection with
the Mergers, and if made, such representation or warranty must not be relied
upon by Parent or Merger Sub as having been authorized by such party and (c)
any estimates, projections, predictions, data, financial information,
memoranda, presentations or any other materials or information provided or
addressed to Parent and Merger Sub or any of their respective Representatives
are not and shall not be deemed to be or include representations or warranties
unless any such materials or information is the subject of an express

ADDITIONAL AGREEMENTS

 

Section 5.1 _Preparation of Joint Proxy Statement; Stockholders Meetings_.

 

(a) As promptly as reasonably practicable following the date of this
Agreement, Parent and the Company shall cooperate in preparing and
shall cause to be filed with the SEC mutually acceptable proxy materials
which shall constitute the joint proxy statement/prospectus relating to the
matters to be submitted to the Company stockholders at the Company
Stockholders Meeting and to the Parent stockholders at the Parent
Stockholders Meeting (such joint proxy statement/prospectus, and any
amendments or supplements thereto, the " _Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus_
"), and Parent shall prepare and file with the SEC a registration statement
on Form S-4 (of which the Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus shall be included
as a prospectus) with respect to the Parent Stock Issuance (such Form S-4,
and any amendments or supplements thereto, the " _Form S-4_"). Each of Parent
and the Company shall furnish all information required to be disclosed in the
Form S-4 and Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus concerning itself, its
Affiliates and the holders of its capital stock to the other, including all
information necessary for the preparation of pro forma financial statements,
and provide such other assistance as may be reasonably requested in connection
with the preparation, filing and distribution of the Form S-4 and Joint Proxy
Statement/Prospectus. Prior to filing the Form S-4 (or any amendment or
supplement thereto) or filing or mailing the Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus
(or any amendment or supplement thereto) or responding to any comments of the
SEC with respect thereto, each of Parent and the Company shall cooperate and
provide the other a reasonable opportunity to review and comment on such
document or response. No filing of, or amendment or supplement to, the
Form S-4 or the Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus will be made by Parent or
the Company, as applicable, without the others prior consent (which shall not
be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned). Including as described in
_Section 5.1(a)_ of the Company Disclosure Letter, Parent and the Company
shall use reasonable best efforts to have the Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus
cleared by the SEC and the Form S-4 declared effective by the SEC and to keep
the Form S-4 effective as long as is necessary to consummate the Merger and
the transactions contemplated thereby (including the Parent Stock Issuance).
Parent and the Company shall, as promptly as practicable after receipt
thereof, provide the other Party with copies of any written comments and
advise the other Party of any oral comments with respect to the Joint Proxy
Statement/Prospectus or the Form S-4 received from the SEC. Each Party shall
use its reasonable best efforts to take any action required to be taken under
any applicable state securities Laws in connection with the Merger, and each
Party shall furnish all information concerning it, its Affiliates and the
holders of its capital stock as may be reasonably requested in connection with
any such action. Each Party will advise the other Party, promptly after it
receives notice thereof, of the time when the Form S-4 has become effective,
the issuance of any stop order, the suspension of the qualification of the
Parent Common Stock issuable in connection with the Merger for offering or
sale in any jurisdiction, or any request by the SEC for amendment of the Joint
Proxy Statement/Prospectus or the Form S-4. If, at any time prior to the
Effective Time, any information relating to any of the Parties, or their
respective Affiliates, officers or directors, should be discovered by either
Party which should be set forth in an amendment or supplement to any of the
Form S-4 or the Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus so that such documents would
not include any misstatement of a material fact or omit to state any material
fact necessary to make the statements therein, in light 

 



71  of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, then the
Party that discovers such information shall promptly notify the other Party
and, to the extent required by Law, an appropriate amendment or supplement
describing such information shall be promptly filed with the SEC, after the
other party has had a reasonable opportunity to review and comment thereon,
and, to the extent required by applicable Law, disseminated to the respective
stockholders of Parent and the Company. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary in this Section 5.1, nothing in this _Section_ __ _ 5.1_ shall
prohibit the Company or Parent from making any filing of any Quarterly Report
on Form 10-Q, Annual Report on Form 10-K or Current Report on Form 8-K
required pursuant to the Exchange Act. 

(b) The Company shall duly take all lawful action to call, give notice of,
convene and hold a meeting of its stockholders as promptly as practicable
(and in any event within 45 days) following the date upon which the Form S-4
becomes effective (the " _Company Stockholders Meeting_ ") for the purpose of
obtaining the Company Required Vote. Unless a Change in Company
Recommendation has occurred in accordance with _Section_ __ _ 5.4_, the
Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to obtain from the stockholders
of the Company the Company Required Vote. Unless a Change in Company
Recommendation has occurred in accordance with _Section_ __ _ 5.4_, the
Company and the Board of Directors of the Company will recommend to its
stockholders adoption of this Agreement and the Company shall cause the Joint
Proxy Statement/Prospectus and the Form S-4 to include such recommendation.
Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this _Section 5.1(b)_ , if, on the
date for which the Company Stockholders Meeting is scheduled, (i) there are
insufficient shares of Company Common Stock represented (either in person or
by proxy) to constitute a quorum necessary to conduct the business of the
Company Stockholder Meeting or the Company has not received proxies
representing a sufficient number of shares of Company Common Stock to obtain
the Company Required Vote, whether or not a quorum is present or (ii)
additional time is needed for the filing and dissemination of any
supplemental or amended disclosure document that the Companys board of
directors has determined in good faith (after consultation with the Companys
outside legal counsel) is necessary or required to be filed and disseminated
under applicable Laws, the Company shall have the right to (and at the
request of Parent shall) make one or more successive postponements or
adjournments of the Company Stockholders Meeting; _provided_ that unless
otherwise agreed to by the Parties, the Company Stockholders Meeting shall
not be postponed or adjourned to a date that is more than 30 days after the
date for which the Company Stockholders Meeting was originally scheduled
(excluding any adjournments or postponements required by applicable Law).
Nothing contained in this Agreement (absent termination of this Agreement in
accordance with its terms) shall be deemed to relieve the Company of its
obligation to submit this Agreement to its stockholders for a vote on the
adoption thereof. The Company agrees that, unless this Agreement shall have
been terminated in accordance with _Section_ __ _ 7.1_, its obligation to
hold the Company Stockholders Meeting pursuant to this  _Section_ __ _ 5.1_
shall not be affected by the commencement, public proposal, public disclosure
or communication to the Company or its Board of Directors of any Acquisition
Proposal, by any Change in Company Recommendation or by any development,
fact, circumstance or change that would give rise to a right to make a Change
in Company Recommendation.

(c) Parent shall duly take all lawful action to call, give notice of, convene
and hold a meeting of its stockholders as promptly as practicable (and in any
event within 45 days) following the date upon which the Form S-4 becomes
effective (the " _Parent Stockholders_

 



72   _Meeting_ ") for the purpose of obtaining the Parent Required Vote. Unless
a Change in Parent Recommendation has occurred in accordance with _Section_ __
_ 5.4_, Parent shall use its reasonable best efforts to obtain from the
stockholders of Parent the Parent Required Vote. Unless a Change in Parent
Recommendation has occurred in accordance with _Section_ __ _ 5.4_, Parent
and the Board of Directors of Parent will recommend to its stockholders
approval of the Parent Stock Issuance and Parent shall cause the Joint Proxy
Statement/Prospectus and the Form S-4 to include such
recommendation. Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this _Section
5.1(c)_ if, on a date for which the Parent Stockholders Meeting is scheduled,
(i) there are insufficient shares of Parent Common Stock represented (either
in person or by proxy) to constitute a quorum necessary to conduct the
business of the Parent Stockholder Meeting or Parent has not received proxies
representing a sufficient number of shares of Parent Common Stock to obtain
the Parent Required Vote, whether or not a quorum is present or (ii)
(additional time is needed for the filing and dissemination of any
supplemental or amended disclosure document that the Parents board of
directors has determined in good faith (after consultation with the
Parents outside legal counsel) is necessary or required to be filed and
disseminated under applicable Laws Parent shall have the right to (and at the
request of the Company shall) make one or more successive postponements or
adjournments of the Parent Stockholders Meeting; _provided_ that unless
otherwise agreed to by the Parties, the Parent Stockholders Meeting shall not
be postponed or adjourned to a date that is (i) more than 30 days after the
date for which the Parent Stockholders Meeting was originally scheduled
(excluding any postponements or adjournments required by applicable Law) or
(ii) 90 days after the record date for the Parent Stockholders Meeting,
whichever is earlier. Nothing contained in this Agreement (absent termination
of this Agreement in accordance with its terms) shall be deemed to relieve
Parent of its obligation to submit the Parent Stock Issuance to its
stockholders for a vote on the approval thereof. Parent agrees that, unless
this Agreement shall have been terminated in accordance with _Section_ __ _
7.1_, its obligation to hold the Parent Stockholders Meeting pursuant to this
_Section_ __ _ 5.1_ shall not be affected by the commencement,
public proposal, public disclosure or communication to Parent or its Board of
Directors of any Acquisition Proposal, by any Change in Parent Recommendation
or by any development, fact, circumstance or change that would give rise to a
right to make a Change in Parent Recommendation.

(d) Each of Parent and the Company shall cooperate and use their reasonable
best efforts to cause the Parent Stockholders Meeting and the Company
Stockholders Meeting to be held at the same date and, subject to the terms and
conditions of this _Section_ __ _ 5.1_, as soon as reasonably practicable
after the date of this Agreement.

 

Section 5.2 _Access to Information_. From and after the date of this Agreement

request of the other Party, each of Parent and the Company shall (and shall
cause each of their respective Subsidiaries to) afford to the Representatives
of the other, reasonable access, during normal business hours in such a manner
as not to unreasonably interfere with the operation of any business conducted
by the other Party, to all its properties (other than for purposes
of invasive testing), books, contracts, records and Representatives;
_provided_ that all such access shall be coordinated through the disclosing
Party or its Representatives in accordance with such procedures as they may
reasonably establish. Neither Party nor any of its Subsidiaries shall be
required to provide access to or to disclose information where such access or
disclosure would (i) violate or prejudice the rights of its

 



73  tenants, operators, service providers or development or joint venture
partners, (ii) result in a competitor of such disclosing Party receiving
information that is competitively sensitive (provided that in the case of
information to be provided to Parent or the Company each Party will attempt to
establish a clean team process to share such materials in a commercially
reasonable manner), (iii) jeopardize the attorney-client privilege of the
institution in possession or control of such information or (iv) contravene
any Law or binding agreement (including any confidentiality obligation)
entered into prior to the date of this Agreement. Parent and the Company will
make appropriate substitute disclosure arrangements under circumstances in
which the restrictions of the preceding sentence apply. No such investigation
by either Parent or the Company shall affect the representations and
warranties of the other. The terms of the Confidentiality Agreement shall
apply to any information and access provided pursuant to this _Section_ __ _
5.2_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this _Section_ __
_ 5.2_, neither Parent nor the Company shall (and Parent and the Company
shall ensure that their respective Affiliates and Representatives do not)
conduct, without the prior written consent of the Company or Parent,
respectively, any environmental investigation at any real property owned or
leased by the Company or Parent, respectively, that involves any sampling or
other intrusive investigation of air, surface water, groundwater or soil at
such real property. The foregoing provisions of this  _Section_ __ _ 5.2_
shall not apply to any access rights relating to the Financing (which rights
are addressed in _Section_ __ _ 5.13_).

Governmental Entity, (iii) supply as promptly as reasonably practicable any
additional information and documentary material that may be requested

with any Governmental Entity, or from any other Person alleging that the
consent of such person (or another Person) is or may be required in
connection with the Merger or the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, and consider in good faith the views of the other Party and keep
the other Party reasonably informed of the status of matters related to
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including furnishing the
other Party with any written notices or other communications received by such
Party from, or given by such Party to, any Governmental Entity and of any
communication received or given in connection with any proceeding by a
private party, in each case regarding any of the transactions contemplated
hereby, except that any materials concerning one Partys valuation of the
other Party may be redacted; and (iii) permit the other Party to review in
draft any proposed substantive or other non-ministerial communication to be
submitted by it to any Governmental Entity with reasonable time and
opportunity to comment, and consult with each other in advance of any in-

by a private party, with any other Person, and, to the extent permitted by the
applicable Governmental Entity or Person, not agree to participate in any
meeting or substantive or other non-ministerial discussion with any
Governmental Entity relating to any filings or investigations concerning this

Laws. In furtherance of the foregoing, prior to being exchanged with the other
Party, any materials may be redacted (x) as necessary to comply with
contractual arrangements entered into prior to the date of this Agreement or
applicable Laws, and (y) as necessary to address reasonable attorney-client or

defending any lawsuits or other legal proceedings, whether judicial or
administrative, challenging this Agreement or the consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby (including seeking to have any stay,
temporary restraining order or preliminary injunction entered by any court or
other Governmental Entity vacated or reversed).

(d) Parent and the Company shall reasonably cooperate with each other and use
their respective reasonable best efforts to take such actions as the other
may reasonably request to obtain any consents from any third parties
(excluding any Governmental Entity) as may be reasonably required to
consummate the Merger or the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement; _provided_ that Parent and the Company shall not be required to,
and shall not without the other Partys written approval (not to be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed), incur any material expenses
or liabilities or make any material concessions to such third party in order
to obtain such consents.

 



75 (e) Each of the Company, the Board of Directors of the Company, Parent and the
Board of Directors of Parent shall, if any state takeover statute or similar
statute becomes applicable to this Agreement, the Merger, or any other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, use all reasonable best efforts
to ensure that the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, including the Parent Stock Issuance, may be consummated as promptly
as practicable on the terms contemplated hereby and otherwise to minimize the
effect of such statute or regulation on this Agreement, the Merger and the
other transactions contemplated hereby.

the Company (including the Debt Refinancings) (all of which are addressed in 
_Section_ __ _ 5.13_). Nothing in this _Section_ __ _ 5.3_ shall prevent or
limit the ability of Parent or the Company to take any action permitted under

(a) Each of the Company and Parent agrees that it shall not, it shall cause
its Subsidiaries and its and their respective directors and officers not to,

made or submitted an Acquisition Proposal (or its advisors) to the Company or
its Representatives or Parent or its Representatives, as the case may be,
solely for the purpose of clarifying the proposal and any material terms
thereof and the conditions to consummation, so as to determine whether such
Acquisition Proposal would reasonably be expected to result in a Superior
Proposal.

 



76 (b) (i) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, prior to
its receipt of the Company Required Vote (in the case of the Company) or the
Parent Required Vote (in the case of Parent), in response to a _bona fide_

non-public information regarding the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or
Parent or any of its Subsidiaries, respectively, without first entering into
a confidentiality agreement with the Person who has made such Acquisition
Proposal having provisions that are no less favorable to such Party than those

Company, make any notices, and provide any tax opinion or related
documentation, to Ventas to the extent required by the Tax Matters Agreement
in connection with any such Acquisition Proposal; _provided_ that prior to

Board of Directors of the Company or the Board of Directors of Parent, as
applicable, determines in good faith that based on the information then
available, such Acquisition Proposal either constitutes a Superior Proposal or

Proposal is referred to as a " _Qualifying Acquisition Proposal_."
The Company or Parent, as applicable, shall provide the other with a copy of

the Parent Stock Issuance (a " _Change in Parent Recommendation_ ").

(iv) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary (but subject
to this _Section 5.4(b)(iv)_ ), prior to its receipt of the Company Required
Vote (in the case of the Company) or the Parent Required Vote (in the case of
Parent), in response to a Qualifying Acquisition Proposal, the Board of
Directors of the Company or Board of Directors of Parent, as applicable, may
make a Change in Company Recommendation or a Change in Parent Recommendation

Party advising such other Party that the notifying Party intends to take such
action and specifying in reasonable detail the reasons therefor, including
the terms and conditions of any such Superior Proposal that is the basis of
the proposed action (a " _Notice of Superior Proposal Recommendation Change_
") (it being agreed that neither the delivery of such notice by the Company
or Parent, as the case may be, nor any public announcement of the delivery of
such notice that the Company or Parent, as the case may be, determines that it
is required to make under applicable Law shall constitute a Change in
Company Recommendation or Change in Parent Recommendation, as the case may
be, unless and until the Board of Directors of the Company or Parent, as the
case may be, shall have failed to, within twenty-four (24) hours after such
five day period (or three day period, as applicable), publicly announce that
it is recommending this Agreement and the Merger or the Parent Stock Issuance,
as applicable (taking into account any adjustment or modification of the terms
of this Agreement and the Merger agreed to by the parties hereto in writing))
(it being understood that any amendment to any material term of such Superior
Proposal (including any change in the form or amount of consideration) shall
require a new Notice of Superior Proposal

the case of the Company) or the Parent Required Vote (in the case of Parent)
the Board of Directors of the Company or Board of Directors of Parent,
as applicable, may make a Change in Company Recommendation or a Change in
Parent Recommendation, as applicable, if and only if (A) a material change or
development has occurred or arisen after the date of this Agreement that was
neither known to nor reasonably foreseeable as of the date of this Agreement
by such Partys Board of Directors (and which change or development does not
involve or relate to an Acquisition Proposal and, with respect to a Change in
Parent Recommendation, any such change or development is not Parents or
Parent OPs ability, or perceived likelihood, to effect or obtain the
Financing or the Debt Refinancings), (B) the Board of Directors of the Company
or the Board of Directors of Parent, as applicable, has determined in good
faith (after consultation with outside legal counsel) that failure to do so
would be inconsistent with the applicable boards duties under applicable Law,
(C) five calendar days shall have elapsed since the time the Party proposing
to take such action has given written notice to the other Party advising such
other Party that the notifying Party intends to take such action and
specifying in reasonable detail the reasons therefor, (it being agreed that

announce that it is recommending this Agreement and the Merger (taking into
account any adjustment or modification of the terms of this Agreement and the
Merger agreed to by the parties hereto in writing)), (D) during such five-

Agreement proposed by the other Party) that failure to do so would be
inconsistent with the applicable boards duties under applicable Law.

 

(vi) Nothing contained in this _Section_ __ _ 5.4_ shall prohibit the Board
of Directors of the Company or the Board of Directors of Parent, as
applicable, from: (A) taking and disclosing to the stockholders of the Company

Period_ "), Parent shall provide, or shall cause to be provided, to each
employee of the Company and its Subsidiaries who continues to be employed by
Parent or its Subsidiaries following the Effective Time (the " _Continuing
Employees_ "), for so long as such Continuing Employee is employed following
the Effective Time, (i) an annual base salary or wage rate that is no less
favorable to such Continuing Employee than the annual base salary or wage rate
provided to such Continuing Employee immediately prior to the Effective Time;
(ii) an annual cash bonus opportunity that is no less than the annual cash
bonus opportunity that was provided to such Continuing Employee immediately
prior to the Effective Time; (iii) long-term equity incentive opportunities
that are no less favorable than those provided to similarly situated employees
of Parent and its Subsidiaries; and (iv) other employee benefits (excluding
long-term equity incentive opportunities) that are no less favorable in the
aggregate than those provided to similarly situated employees of Parent and
its Subsidiaries, _provided_ that, for purposes of this clause (iv), the
employee benefits generally provided to employees of the Company and
its Subsidiaries as of immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be
deemed to be no less favorable in the aggregate to those provided to similarly
situated employees of Parent and its Subsidiaries, it being understood that
the Continuing Employees may commence participation in the "employee benefit
plans," as defined in Section 3(3) of ERISA (whether or not subject to ERISA),
maintained by Parent or any of its Subsidiaries (collectively, the " _New
Plans_ ") at such times as are determined by Parent. For the avoidance of
doubt, nothing in this Agreement shall require Parent or any of its
Subsidiaries to employ any Person.

 



80 (b) For purposes of any New Plans providing benefits to any Continuing
Employees after the Effective Time, Parent shall, or shall cause its
applicable Subsidiary to: (i) waive all pre-existing conditions, exclusions
and waiting periods with respect to participation and coverage

or exclusions would apply under the analogous Company Benefit Plan; (ii)
provide each Continuing Employee and his or her eligible dependents under any
New Plan with credit for any co-payments and deductibles paid during the
portion of the plan year of the corresponding Company Benefit Plan ending on
the date such Continuing Employees participation in the New Plan begins (to
the same extent that such credit was given under the analogous Company Benefit
Plan prior to the date that the Continuing Employee first participates in the
New Plan) in satisfying any applicable deductible or out-of-pocket
requirements under the New Plan; and (iii) recognize all service of the
Continuing Employees with the Company and its Subsidiaries, for all purposes
in any New Plan in which such employees may be eligible to participate after
the Effective Time to the same extent such service was taken into account
under the analogous Company Benefit Plan prior to the date that
the Continuing Employee first participates in the New Plan; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that the foregoing clause (iii) shall not apply (A) to the extent
it would result in duplication of benefits, or (B) for any purpose with
respect to any defined benefit pension plan, postretirement welfare plan or
any New Plan under which similarly situated employees of Parent and its
Subsidiaries do not receive credit for prior service or that is grandfathered
or frozen, either with respect to level of benefits or participation.

(c) If requested by Parent not less than ten Business Days before the Closing
Date, the Company shall adopt board resolutions and take such corporate
action as is necessary to terminate the Company Benefit Plans that are Tax-
qualified defined contribution plans with a cash or deferred arrangement
under Section 401(k) of the Code (collectively, the " _Company Qualified DC
Plan_ "), effective as of the day prior to the Closing Date but contingent on
the occurrence of the Closing. The form and substance of such resolutions and
any other actions taken in connection with the foregoing termination shall be
subject to the review and approval of Parent. Upon the distribution of the
assets in the accounts under the Company Qualified DC Plan to the
participants, Parent shall permit such participants who are then actively
employed by Parent or its Subsidiaries to make rollover contributions of
"eligible rollover distributions" (within the meaning of Section 401(a)(31) of
the Code), in the form of cash or promissory notes, from the Company
Qualified DC Plan to the applicable Tax-qualified defined contribution plans
of Parent or its Subsidiaries.

the Parties. No current or former director, officer, employee or other
service provider or any other person shall be a third-party beneficiary of
this Agreement, and nothing herein shall be construed as an amendment to any
Parent Benefit Plan, Company Benefit Plan or other compensation or benefit
plan or arrangement for any purpose. Without limiting the generality of the
foregoing in this _Section_ __ _ 5.6_, nothing contained in this Agreement
shall otherwise obligate Parent, the Company or any of their
respective Affiliates to (i) maintain any particular Benefit Plan or (ii)
retain the employment or services of any current or former director, employee
or other service provider.

 



81 Section 5.7 _Fees and Expenses_. Whether or not the Merger is consummated, all

to be increased from five to eight directors and the Company Designees to be
elected as members of the Board of Directors of Parent, filling the three
vacancies created by the increase in the size of the Board of Directors of

successor is duly elected and qualified or their earlier death, resignation or
removal.

(a) At and after the Effective Time, Parent shall, and shall cause the
Surviving Company to, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable Law,
indemnify and hold harmless each past and present director or officer of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries and each Person serving, or who has served,
at the request of the Company as a director, officer, manager, employee,
trustee or agent of another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or
other enterprise (collectively, the " _Indemnified Parties_ ") against any
costs or expenses (including advancing attorneys fees and expenses in advance
of the final disposition of any actual or threatened claim, suit, proceeding
or investigation to each Indemnified Party), judgments, fines, losses, claims,
damages, liabilities and amounts paid in settlement in connection with any
actual or threatened claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation,
whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative arising out of (i)
actions or omissions occurring at or prior to the Effective Time (and whether
asserted or claimed prior to, at or after the Effective Time) to the extent
that they are based on or arise out of the fact that such person is or was a
director or officer of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or is or was
serving at the request of the Company as a director, officer, manager,
employee, trustee or agent of another corporation, partnership, joint venture,
trust or other enterprise or (ii) to the extent they are based on or arise out
of or pertain to the transactions contemplated hereby, including the Merger,
whether asserted or claimed prior to, at or after the Effective Time, and
including any expenses incurred in enforcing such persons rights under this
_Section_ __ _ 5.9_; ( _provided_ such Indemnified Party agrees in advance
to return any such funds to which a court of competent jurisdiction has
determined in a final, nonappealable judgment such Indemnified Party is not
ultimately entitled), in each case to the same extent that the Company or its
Subsidiaries would have been required to do so pursuant to the Organizational
Documents of the Company or its Subsidiaries, as applicable. Notwithstanding
anything herein to the contrary, if any Indemnified Party notifies the
Surviving Company on or prior to the sixth anniversary of the Effective Time
of a matter in respect of which such Person may seek indemnification pursuant
to this _Section_ __ _ 5.9_, the provisions of this _Section_ __ _ 5.9_
shall continue in effect with respect to such matter until the final
disposition of all claims, actions, investigations, suits and proceedings
relating thereto.

 

(b) For six years after the Effective Time, Parent shall, (i) except to the
extent such agreement provides for an earlier termination, cause to be
maintained in effect the provisions regarding elimination of liability,
indemnification and advancement of expenses in any agreements (other than
insurance contracts) of the Company and its Subsidiaries with any 

 



82  Indemnified Party that are in existence on the date of this Agreement, to
the extent such agreements have been made available to Parent prior to the
date of this Agreement and (ii) not amend, modify or repeal such provisions
in any manner that would materially and adversely affect the rights or
protections thereunder of any such Indemnified Party in respect of acts or
omissions occurring or alleged to have occurred at or prior to the Effective
Time (including acts or omissions occurring in connection with the adoption of
this Agreement and the consummation of the Merger).

 

(c) Prior to the Effective Time, in consultation with Parent as provided in
this _Section 5.9(c)_ , the Company shall be permitted to, and if the Company
fails to do so, Parent shall, obtain and fully pay the premium for a six-year
prepaid "tail" policy for the extension of the directors and officers
liability coverage of the Companys existing directors and officers
liability insurance policies and fiduciary liability insurance policies, in
each case for a claims reporting or discovery period of six years from and
after the Effective Time, on terms and conditions providing coverage
retentions, limits and other material terms substantially equivalent to the
current policies of directors and officers liability insurance and fiduciary
liability insurance maintained by the Company with respect to matters arising
on or before the Effective Time, covering without limitation the transactions
contemplated hereby; _provided_ , _however_ , that the Company shall, in
cooperation with Parent, use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain the
most favorable pricing and most comprehensive coverage reasonably available
for such "tail" policy and neither the Company nor Parent shall commit or
spend on such "tail" policy more than 300% of the last aggregate annual
premium paid by the Company prior to the date of this Agreement for the
Companys current policies of directors and officers liability insurance and
fiduciary liability insurance (the " _Base Amount_ "), and if the cost of
such "tail" policy would otherwise exceed the Base Amount, the Company shall
be permitted to, or in the case of Parent, shall, purchase as much coverage as
reasonably practicable for the Base Amount. After the Effective Time, Parent
shall cause such "tail" policy to be maintained in full force and effect, for
its full term, and shall honor all of its obligations thereunder, and no Party
shall have any other obligation to purchase or pay for any
insurance hereunder. The Company shall in good faith cooperate and consult
with Parent prior to the Effective Time with respect to the procurement of
such "tail" policy, including with respect to the selection of the broker,
available policy price and coverage options, and shall in good faith consider
Parents recommendations with respect thereto. If the Company and Parent for
any reason fail to obtain such "tail" insurance policy as of the Effective
Time, Parent shall (i) maintain in effect for a period of at least six (6)
years from and after the Effective Time (and for so long thereafter as any
claims brought before the end of such six-year period thereunder are being
adjudicated) the directors and officers liability coverage in place as of
the date hereof with terms, conditions, retentions and limits of liability
that are at least as favorable as provided in the Companys existing
policies as of the date hereof, or (ii) purchase comparable directors and
officers liability coverage for such six-year period (and for so long
thereafter as any claims brought before the end of such six-year period
thereunder are being adjudicated) with terms, conditions, retentions and
limits of liability that are at least as favorable as provided in the
Companys existing policies as of the date hereof; provided, however, in each
case, in no event shall Parent be required to commit or spend more than the
Base Amount on any such directors and officers liability coverage.

 

(d) If Parent or any of its successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or
merges into any other Person and shall not be the continuing or surviving
company or entity of

 



83  such consolidation or merger, or (ii) transfers or conveys all or
substantially all of its properties and assets to any Person, then, and in
each such case, to the extent necessary, proper provision shall be made so
that the successors and assigns of Parent shall assume the obligations set
forth in this _Section_ __ _ 5.9_.

 

(e) The provisions of this _Section_ __ _ 5.9_ (i) are intended to be for the
benefit of, and shall be enforceable by, each Indemnified Party, and (ii) are
in addition to, and not in substitution for, any other rights to
indemnification or contribution that any such person may have by contract or
otherwise.

 

Section 5.10 _Dividends_.

 

(a) Each of the Company and Parent shall declare a dividend to their
respective common stockholders, the record date, and payment date (to
the extent practicable), for which shall be the close of business on the last
Business Day prior to the Closing Date (the " _Closing Dividend Date_ "),
subject to funds being legally available therefor. The per share dividend
amount payable by the Company shall be an amount equal to (i) the per share
amount of the Companys most recent quarterly dividend, multiplied by the
number of days elapsed since such last dividend payment date through and
including the Closing Dividend Date, and divided by the actual number of days
in the calendar quarter in which such dividend is declared, plus (ii) an
additional amount per share (the " _Additional Dividend Amount_ "), if any,
necessary so that the aggregate dividend payable by the Company is equal to
the Minimum Distribution Dividend. The per share dividend amount payable by
Parent to holders of shares of Parent Common Stock shall be an amount equal to
(A) the per share amount of Parents most recent quarterly dividend on the
Parent Common Stock, multiplied by the number of days elapsed since such last
dividend payment date through and including the Closing Dividend Date, and
divided by the actual number of days in the calendar quarter in which such
dividend is declared, plus (B) the Additional Dividend Amount (on a per share
basis), if any, divided by the Exchange Ratio. If the Company determines it is
necessary to declare the Additional Dividend Amount, the Company shall notify
Parent in writing of such determination at least ten Business Days prior to
the Company Stockholders Meeting.

(b) If the Company determines that it is necessary to declare a Special
Company Distribution in accordance with _Section 4.1(b)(iv)_ or if Parent
determines that it is necessary to declare a Special Parent Distribution in
accordance with _Section 4.2(b)(iv)_ , the Company or Parent, as applicable,
shall notify Parent or the Company, as the case may be, in writing at least
ten Business Days prior to the Company Stockholders Meeting and the Parent
Stockholders Meeting, as applicable, and such other Party shall be entitled
to declare a dividend per share payable (i) in the case of the Company, to
holders of shares of Company Common Stock, in an amount per share equal to the
product of (A) the Special Parent Distribution declared by Parent with
respect to each share of Parent Common Stock and (B) the Exchange Ratio and
(ii) in the case of Parent, to holders of shares of Parent Common Stock, in an
amount per share equal to the quotient obtained by dividing (x) the Special
Company Distribution declared by the Company with respect to each share of
Company Common Stock by (y) the Exchange Ratio. The record date and payment
date for any dividend payable pursuant to this  _Section_ __ _ 5.10_ shall
be the Closing Dividend Date.

 



84 (c) In the event that a dividend or other distribution with respect to the
shares of Company Common Stock permitted under the terms of this Agreement
has (i) a record date prior to the Effective Time and (ii) has not been paid
as of the Effective Time, the holders of shares of Company Common Stock shall
be entitled to receive such dividend or other distribution pursuant to and in
accordance with _Section_ __ _ 2.2_, without duplication.

 

Section 5.11 _Public Announcements_. Except (a) for communications consistent
with the final form of joint press release announcing the Merger and the
investor presentation given to investors on the date of announcement of the
Merger, (b) as may be required by applicable Law or by obligations pursuant to
any listing agreement with or rules of the NYSE or NASDAQ or (c) subject to
_Section_ __ _ 5.4_, in connection with or relating to an Acquisition
Proposal received by Parent or the Company, the Company and Parent shall
consult with each other, and provide meaningful opportunity for review and
give due consideration to reasonable comment by the other Party, prior to
issuing any press releases or other public written communications or otherwise
making planned public statements with respect to the Merger and the
other transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

Section 5.12 _Tax Matters_.

 

(a) The Company and Parent shall use their respective reasonable best efforts
to cause the Merger to qualify as a "reorganization" within the meaning of
Section 368(a) of the Code.

(b) [Reserved.]

 

(c) Parent and the Company shall take the actions described in _Section
5.12(c)_ of the Company Disclosure Letter.

 

(d) The Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to (i) obtain the
Company 368 Opinion and the Parent REIT Opinion, (ii) assist Parent in
obtaining the Company REIT Opinion and the Parent 368 Opinion, (iii) deliver
to Sidley Austin LLP (or, if other legal counsel will render the Company 368
Opinion, such other legal counsel) and Fried, Frank, Harris, Shriver
and Jacobson LLP (or, if other legal counsel will render the Parent 368
Opinion, such other legal counsel), officers certificates, dated as of the
Closing Date (and similar certificates dated as of the effective date of the
Form S-4 if necessary), signed by an officer of the Company, containing
representations of the Company requested by legal counsel in rendering the
Company 368 Opinion or the Parent 368 Opinion, or in connection with the Form
S-4 (the " _Company 368 Representation Letters_ ") and (iv) deliver to Sidley
Austin LLP (or, if other legal counsel will render the Company REIT Opinion,
such other legal counsel) and Fried, Frank, Harris, Shriver and Jacobson LLP
(or, if other legal counsel will render the Parent REIT Opinion, such other
legal counsel) officers certificates, dated as of the Closing Date (and
similar certificates dated as of the effective date of the Form S-4 if
necessary), signed by an officer of the Company, containing representations of
the Company requested by legal counsel in rendering the Company REIT Opinion
or the Parent REIT Opinion, or in connection with the Form S-4 (the "
_Company REIT Representation Letters_ "). If the legal counsel initially
selected by the Company to render the Company 368 Opinion is unable to render
either such opinion but Parents legal counsel is able to render the Parent
368 Opinion, then the Company shall use its

 



85  reasonable best efforts in good faith to engage another nationally
recognized legal counsel reasonably acceptable to the Company that is able to
render the Company 368 Opinion. If the legal counsel initially selected by
the Company to render the Company REIT Opinion is unable to render such
opinion but Parents legal counsel is able to render the Parent REIT Opinion,
then the Company shall use its reasonable best efforts in good faith to
engage another nationally recognized legal counsel reasonably acceptable to
the Company and Parent that is able to render the Company REIT Opinion.

 

(e) Parent shall use its reasonable best efforts to (i) obtain the Parent 368
Opinion, (ii) assist the Company in obtaining the Parent REIT Opinion and the
Company 368 Opinion, (iii) deliver to Fried, Frank, Harris, Shriver and Jacobson
LLP (or, if other legal counsel will render the Parent 368 Opinion, such other
legal counsel) and Sidley Austin LLP (or, if other legal counsel will render
the Company 368 Opinion, such other legal counsel) officers certificates,
dated as of the Closing Date (and similar certificates dated as of the
effective date of the Form S-4 if necessary), signed by an officer of Parent,
containing representations of Parent requested by legal counsel in rendering
the Parent 368 Opinion or the Company 368 Opinion (the " _Parent
368 Representation Letters_ "), and (iv) deliver to Fried, Frank, Harris,
Shriver and Jacobson LLP (or, if other legal counsel will render the Parent REIT
Opinion, such other legal counsel) and Sidley Austin LLP (or, if other
legal counsel will render the Company REIT Opinion, such other legal counsel)
officers certificates, dated as of the Closing Date (and similar certificates
dated as of the effective date of the Form S-4 if necessary), signed by an
officer of Parent, containing representations of Parent requested by legal
counsel in rendering the Parent REIT Opinion or the Company REIT Opinion, or
in connection with the Form S-4 (the " _Parent REIT Representation Letters_
"). If the legal counsel initially selected by Parent to render the Parent 368
Opinion is unable to render such opinion but the Companys legal counsel is
able to render the Company 368 Opinion, then Parent shall use its reasonable
best efforts in good faith to engage another nationally recognized legal
counsel reasonably acceptable to Parent that is able to render the Parent 368
Opinion. If the legal counsel initially selected by Parent to render the
Parent REIT Opinion is unable to render such opinion but the Companys legal
counsel is able to render the Company REIT Opinion, then Parent shall use its
reasonable best efforts in good faith to engage another nationally recognized
legal counsel reasonably acceptable to Parent and the Company that is able to
render the Parent REIT Opinion.

 

Section 5.13 _Financing_.

 

(a) _Parent_ __ _s Obligations to Obtain Financing_.

 

(i) No later than immediately prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall (A)
provide the Company with immediately available funds in an amount sufficient
to repay in full as of the Effective Time all of the Specified Company
Indebtedness (including any prepayment fees or other penalties that would be
payable in connection with any such repayment) in accordance with the terms
thereof the " _Debt Repayments_ ") and (B)(1) enter into the Amended and
Restated Parent Facilities and (2) cause such Amended and Restated Parent
Facilities to be in full force and effect and no default, breach or event of
default to have occurred thereunder or any event that, with or without
notice, lapse of time or both, would (or would reasonably be expected to) give
rise to any default or breach (the " _Debt_ _Recastings_ " and, together with
the Debt Repayments, the " _Debt_ _Refinancings_ "). Parent acknowledges and
agrees

 



86  that its obligations to take the actions required by this _Section
5.13(a)(i)_ are not conditioned upon the receipt by Parent of the Financing.

 

(ii) Parent and Merger Sub shall use their commercially reasonable efforts to
arrange and obtain the Financing not later than the time the Specified
Company Indebtedness issued or borrowed pursuant to any Specified Company
Contract is to be repaid, on the terms and conditions (including, to the
extent applicable, the "flex" provisions) described in the Debt Commitment
Letter (for purposes of this _Section_ __ _ 5.13_, the Debt Commitment
Letter shall include any Fee Letter), including using commercially reasonable
efforts to (A) enter into definitive agreements with respect to the Debt
Commitment Letter on the terms and conditions (as such terms may be modified
or adjusted in accordance with the terms of, and within the limits of the flex
provisions contained in any Fee Letter) contemplated by the Debt Commitment
Letter (the " _Definitive Debt Financing Agreements_ "), (B) satisfy (or
obtain a waiver of) on a timely basis all conditions, including with respect
to the payment of any commitment, engagement or placement fees, applicable to
Parent and within Parents control in the Debt Commitment Letter and the
Definitive Debt Financing Agreements, (C) consummate and cause the Lenders to
consummate the Financing at or prior to Closing if and to the extent any
Specified Company Contract relating to any Specified Company Indebtedness is
or will become in breach or default (with or without notice, lapse of time or
both) at the time of the Closing as a result of the Mergers and (D) enforce
its rights under the Debt Commitment Letter and the Definitive Debt Financing
Agreements. Parent shall not agree to any amendments or modifications to, or
grant any waivers of, any condition or other provision under the Debt
Commitment Letter or the Definitive Debt Financing Agreements without the
prior written consent of the Company (not to be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed), other than any amendment to add lenders, lead
arrangers, bookrunners, syndication agents or similar entities who had not
executed the Debt Commitment Letter as of the date hereof and other than
amendments, modifications or waivers to the Debt Commitment Letters or the
Definitive Debt Financing Agreements if such amendment, modification or waiver
would not (and could not be reasonably expected to) (A) reduce the aggregate
amount of the Financing (including by changing the amount of fees to be paid
or original issue discount of the Financing or similar fee), (B) impose new or
additional conditions, or otherwise amend, modify or expand any conditions,
to the receipt of the Financing, (C) delay or prevent the Closing or the Debt
Refinancings, (D) make the funding of the Financing (or satisfaction of the
conditions to obtaining any of the Financing) less likely to occur or (E)
adversely impact the ability of Parent to enforce its rights against the other
parties to the Debt Commitment Letter or the Definitive Debt Financing
Agreements. Parent shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to
maintain in effect the Debt Commitment Letter, including any Definitive Debt
Financing Agreements, in each case in accordance with their terms, until the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement are consummated. Parent shall
cause to be provided all notices required to be provided pursuant to the Debt
Commitment Letter in accordance with terms and notice periods contemplated
thereby (it being acknowledged and agreed that Parent shall provide the notice
contemplated by Paragraph 10 of Exhibit C to the Debt Commitment Letter no
later than the tenth calendar day following the day on which the SEC declares
the Form S-4 effective). Except as otherwise contemplated by the Debt
Commitment Letter, Parent shall not release or consent to the termination of
the obligations of the Lenders under the Debt Commitment Letter or the
Definitive Debt Financing Agreements, unless (A) all of the Specified Company
Debt Agreement Amendments have been obtained and are in full force and effect
or (B) Parent has entered into the Amended and Restated Parent

 



87  Facilities which provide sufficient commitments, borrowing capacity or
availability to repay in full (including any prepayment fees or other
penalties that would be payable in connection with any such repayment) the
Specified Company Indebtedness for which Specified Company Debt Agreement
Amendments at such times have not been obtained or have been obtained but are
not in full force and effect. Parent shall fully pay any and all
commitment fees or other fees required by the Debt Commitment Letter or the
Fee Letter to be paid after the date of this Agreement in accordance with the
terms and time periods contemplated thereby.

 

(iii) Parent shall not, without the prior written consent of the Company, (not
to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed), prior to or in
connection with the Closing, permit or arrange any debt financing to which the
Company or any Subsidiary of the Company will be a party or by which any of
their respective assets shall be subject or bound, other than the Financing
and the Amended and Restated Parent Facilities. If any portion of the
Financing becomes unavailable on the terms and conditions (including any
"flex" provisions) contemplated in the Debt Commitment Letter, Parent shall
use its commercially reasonable efforts to, as promptly as practicable
following the occurrence of such event but no later than the third (3rd)
Business Day immediately preceding the Outside Date, arrange and obtain from
alternative sources of debt financing an amount sufficient to satisfy the
Financing, on terms and conditions (including any "flex" provisions) that are
at least as favorable to Parent and the Company in the aggregate as those
contained in the Debt Commitment Letter, which shall not expand upon the
conditions precedent or contingencies to the funding on the Closing Date of
the Financing as set forth in the Debt Commitment Letter in effect on the date
hereof or otherwise adversely affect the ability or likelihood of Parent
to timely consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. The new
debt commitment letter and fee letter entered into in connection with such
alternative financing are referred to, respectively, as a " _New Debt
Commitment Letter_ " and a " _New Fee Letter_." In the event Parent enters
into any such New Debt Commitment Letter, (A) Parent shall promptly provide
the Company with true, correct and complete copies thereof, (B) any
reference in this Agreement to the " _Financing_ " shall mean the debt
financing contemplated by the Debt Commitment Letter as modified pursuant to
this clause (iii), and (C) any reference in this Agreement to the " _Debt
Commitment Letter_ " (and any definition incorporating the term " _Debt
Commitment Letter_ ," including the definition of Definitive Debt Financing
Agreements) shall be deemed to include the Debt Commitment Letter and any Fee
Letter to the extent not superseded by a New Debt Commitment Letter or New
Fee Letter, as the case may be, at the time in question and any New Debt
Commitment Letter or New Fee Letter to the extent then in effect.

 

(iv) Parent shall, and shall cause its Representatives to, keep the Company
informed as promptly as practicable in reasonable detail of the status of its
efforts to arrange the Financing and the Amended and Restated Parent
Facilities and substantially concurrently provide to the Company copies of all
documents provided to or received from the Lenders or otherwise related to
the Financing or the Amended and Restated Parent Facilities. Parent shall
give the Company a reasonable opportunity to comment on, and shall consider in
good faith any comments made by the Company on, any proposed amendments to the
Debt Commitment Letter or the Definitive Debt Financing Agreements or the
Amended and Restated Parent Facilities and all proposed drafts of the
Definitive Debt Financing Agreements and the Amended and Restated Parent
Facilities. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, Parent shall
(A) furnish the Company complete, correct and executed copies of any
amendments to the

 



88  Financing Commitments, the Definitive Debt Financing Agreements and the
Amended and Restated Parent Facilities promptly upon their execution and (B)
give the Company prompt written notice (1) of any default or breach (or any
event that, with or without notice, lapse of time or both, would (or could
reasonably be expected to) give rise to any default or breach) by any party
under any of the Debt Commitment Letter, the Definitive Debt Financing
Agreements or the Amended and Restated Parent Facilities of which Parent or
Merger Sub becomes aware, (2) of any termination of the Debt Commitment
Letter, the Definitive Debt Financing Agreements or the Amended and
Restated Parent Facilities, (3) of the receipt of any written notice or other
communication from any person with respect to any (I) actual or potential
default, breach, termination or repudiation of the Debt Commitment Letter, the
Definitive Debt Financing Agreements or the Amended and Restated Parent
Facilities or any provision thereof, in each case by any party thereto, or
(II) material dispute or disagreement between or among any parties to any Debt
Commitment Letter, the Definitive Debt Financing Agreements or the Amended
and Restated Parent Facilities, and (D) if for any reason Parent believes in
good faith that it will not be able to obtain all or any portion of the
Financing on the terms, in the manner or from the sources contemplated by the
Debt Commitment Letter or the Definitive Debt Financing Agreements, as the
case may be, or enter into the Amended and Restated Parent Facilities.

 

(v) In the event that the Commitments (as defined in the Debt Commitment
Letter) with respect to the Bridge Facility (as defined in the
Debt Commitment Letter) are reduced as contemplated under clauses (a) through
(c) of the Section titled "Mandatory Repayments and Commitment Reductions" in
Exhibit B of the Debt Commitment Letter, Parent shall cause the proceeds
received by Parent or its Subsidiaries that results in such reduction (the
"Reduction Proceeds") to be held as restricted cash for the purpose of
repaying the Specified Company Indebtedness, such that there are no conditions
or restrictions on Parents ability to use such proceeds for such purpose
(including any restriction as to which a Subsidiary of Parent is subject, to
the extent such restriction prohibits such Subsidiary from transferring,
directly or indirectly, such proceeds to Parent). To the extent any of such
Reduction Proceeds were generated from securities or Indebtedness that has a
scheduled redemption or mandatory redemption or put right (other than
customary change of control redemption or put rights), Parent shall ensure
that such scheduled redemption shall not be scheduled to occur prior to, and
such right shall not be exercisable prior to, a date that is earlier than the
Outside Date. For the avoidance of doubt, the foregoing restrictions shall
not apply with respect to Commitments which have been reduced pursuant to
clause (d) the Section titled "Mandatory Repayments and Commitment Reductions"
in Exhibit B of the Debt Commitment Letter. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, Parent shall not be required to hold Reduction Proceeds as
restricted cash for the purpose of repaying the Specified Company Indebtedness
to the extent that such Reduction Proceeds exceed the amount of the Specified
Company Indebtedness for which the Requisite Consents (as defined in the Debt
Commitment Letter) have not been obtained. In addition, Parent shall have no
obligation to hold any Reduction Proceeds as restricted cash for the purpose
of repaying the Specified Company Indebtedness if (A) all of the Specified
Company Debt Agreement Amendments have been obtained and are in full force and
effect or (B) Parent has entered into the Amended and Restated Parent
Facilities which provide sufficient commitments, borrowing capacity or
availability to repay in full (including any prepayment fees or other
penalties that would be payable in connection with any such repayment) the
Specified Company Indebtedness for which Specified Company Debt
Agreement Amendments at such times have not been obtained or have been
obtained but are not in full force and effect.

 



89 (b) _Company Financing Cooperation_. The Company shall, and shall cause its
Subsidiaries to, and shall use commercially reasonable efforts to cause its
and their Representatives to, use commercially reasonable efforts to, at
Parents expense, provide such cooperation reasonably requested by Parent in
connection with the Financing and Debt Refinancing (including, without
limitation, assumptions, guarantees, amendments, supplements, modifications,
refinancings, replacements, repayments, terminations or prepayments of
existing financing arrangements) as Parent may reasonably determine necessary
or advisable in connection with the completion of the Financing and Debt
Refinancing. Such cooperation shall include using commercially reasonable
efforts to (A) participate in a reasonable number of meetings, calls,
rating agency and other presentations, drafting sessions, roadshows and due
diligence sessions in connection with the Financing and Debt Refinancing, (B)
assist Parent with Parents efforts to obtain ratings in respect of Parent and
public ratings in respect of any debt issued or borrowed as part of any
financing arrangements, or assumed or intended to remain outstanding following
the consummation of the Mergers, from Fitch Ratings, Inc., Standard and Poors
Financial Services LLC and Moodys Investor Services, Inc., (C) provide
reasonable and timely assistance with the preparation by Parent of materials
for presentations, offering memoranda, prospectuses, bank information
memoranda and similar documents required in connection with such financing
arrangements, and materials for rating agency presentations for any financing
arrangements, (D) (1) furnish Parent the historical financial information of
the Company specified in paragraph 7 in Exhibit C of the Debt Commitment
Letter as in effect on the date hereof (the " _Required Information_ ") and
(2) furnish Parent and its potential financing sources as promptly as
reasonably practicable such historical information as may be reasonably
necessary for the Required Information to remain Compliant and such other
pertinent historical financial and other customary information (including
assistance in Parents preparing projections, financial statements, forecasts
and other forward-looking information) to the extent reasonably requested by
Parent in connection with the preparation by Parent of customary information
to be used for the Financing; (E) cause its independent registered
public accounting firm (1) to cooperate with Parent in connection with any
financing arrangements, including, to the extent applicable, by providing
customary "comfort letters" (including customary "negative assurances")
and (2) to provide customary assistance with the due diligence activities of
Parent and the financing sources and the preparation by Parent of any
customary pro forma financial statements, and customary consents to the
inclusion of audit reports in any relevant marketing materials, registration
statements and related government filings; (F) attempt to ensure that any
financing arrangements benefit from the existing lending relationships of the
Company and its Subsidiaries; (G) obtain such consents, approvals and
authorizations from third parties required in connection with the Financing
and Debt Refinancing which may be reasonably requested by Parent; (H) assist
with the preparation of customary definitive financing documentation as may
be reasonably requested by Parent, including pledge and security documents,
guarantees, instruments, copies of any existing surveys, UCC financing
statements, filings, security agreements, control agreements, title insurance
and other matters ancillary to, or required in connection with, the Financing
and Debt Refinancing (and delivering stock certificates for certificated
securities and (with transfer powers executed in blank) of the Company and its
domestic Subsidiaries to the extent required on the Closing Date by the terms
of any financing arrangements) (it being understood and agreed that all
solvency or similar certificates shall be executed and delivered by officers
of Parent); (I) cause officers of the Company and its Subsidiaries to
participate in the negotiation of the Definitive Debt Financing Agreements and

 



90  the Debt Refinancing and (J) to the extent requested in writing at least ten
Business Days prior to the Closing, deliver at least three Business Days prior
to the Closing all documentation and other information with respect to the
Company and its Subsidiaries that are required by regulatory authorities under
applicable "know-your-customer" rules and regulations, including the USA
PATRIOT Act.

 

(c) The Company shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries to, at Parents sole
expense, use commercially reasonable efforts to, as soon as reasonably
practicable after (and not prior to) the receipt of a written request from
Parent to do so, on the terms and conditions specified by Parent (provided
that such terms are reasonably acceptable to the Company) and in compliance
with all applicable terms and conditions of the Company Debt Agreements, seek
the Specified Company Debt Agreement Amendments on terms that are reasonably
acceptable to the Company, in each case, subject to the occurrence of the
Closing (any such transaction, a " _Debt Transaction_ "). The Company shall
not be required to take any action in respect of any Debt Transaction until
Parent shall have provided the Company with drafts of the necessary
documentation required in connection with such Debt Transaction in a form
reasonably satisfactory to the Company (collectively, the " _Debt Transaction
Documents_ ") at least three Business Days prior to the date of such requested
action. The Company shall use commercially reasonable efforts to, and shall
cause its Subsidiaries to use commercially reasonable efforts to, cause its
and their respective Representatives to provide commercially reasonable
cooperation and assistance reasonably requested by Parent in connection with
the Debt Transactions (it being understood and agreed that the Company shall
not be required to enter into or approve, prior to the Closing, any Debt
Transaction Documents or effect any Debt Transactions the effectiveness of
which is not expressly conditioned on the Closing). It is understood and
agreed that a failure to effectuate any Debt Transaction shall not constitute
a failure by the Company to satisfy its obligations under this _Section
5.13(c)_. 

(d) The Company shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries to, at the sole
expense of Parent, after (and not prior to) the receipt of a written request

termination pursuant to _Section 7.1(k)_ , such Acquisition Proposal shall not
have been publicly withdrawn least three Business Days prior to the date of
the Parent Stockholders Meeting), (B) thereafter this Agreement is terminated
(1) by Parent or the Company pursuant to _Section 7.1(c)_ (if the

 



100  Parent Required Vote has not theretofore been obtained) or _Section 7.1(k)_
or (2) by the Company pursuant to _Section 7.1(h)_ or _Section 7.1(d)(ii)_
and (C) before the date that is twelve months after the date of such
termination, Parent consummates any Acquisition Proposal or enters into any
definitive agreement to effect any Acquisition Agreement, then Parent shall,
on the earlier of (I) the date on which such Acquisition Proposal is
consummated and (II) the date on which such Acquisition Agreement is entered
into, pay to the Company the Parent Termination Fee less the amount of any
Company Expense Reimbursement previously paid to the Company (if any)
pursuant to _Section 7.2(c)(iv)_ ( _provided_ that, for purposes of clause (C)
above, each reference to "20%" in the definitions of "Acquisition Proposal"
and "Acquisition Agreement" shall be deemed to be a reference to "50%").

(iii) In the event that Parent terminates this Agreement pursuant to
_Section 7.1(g)_ , Parent shall pay the Company the Parent Termination Fee
prior to or substantially concurrently with such termination.

(iv) In the event that Parent or the Company terminates this Agreement
pursuant to _Sections 7.1(k)_ , then Parent shall pay to the Company the
Company Expense Reimbursement; _provided_ that the payment by Parent of the
Company Expense Reimbursement shall not relieve Parent of any subsequent
obligation to pay the Parent Termination Fee pursuant to _Section 7.2(c)(ii)_.

 

(d) In no event shall this _Section_ __ _ 7.2_ require (i) the Company to pay
the Company Termination Fee on more than one occasion or (ii) Parent to pay
the Parent Termination Fee on more than one occasion.

(e) Each of the Parties acknowledges that the agreements contained in this
_Section_ __ _ 7.2_ are an integral part of the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement, and that, without these agreements, the Parties would not
enter into this Agreement. Accordingly, if either the Company or Parent fails
to pay all amounts due to Parent or the Company, as applicable, under this
_Section_ __ _ 7.2_ on the dates specified, then either the Company or
Parent, as applicable, shall pay all costs and expenses (including legal fees
and expenses) incurred by such other Party in connection with any action or
proceeding (including the filing of any lawsuit) taken by it to collect such
unpaid amounts, together with interest on such unpaid amounts at the prime
lending rate prevailing at such time, as published in _The Wall Street
Journal_ , from the date such amounts were required to be paid until the date
actually received by such other Party. Each of the Parties acknowledges that
each of the Parent Expense Reimbursement, the Company Expense Reimbursement,
the Parent Termination Fee and the Company Termination Fee is not a penalty,
but rather are liquidated damages in a reasonable amount that will compensate
a Party in the circumstances in which such amounts are due and payable, which
amounts would otherwise be impossible to calculate with precision.

(f) The " _Company_ _Termination Fee_ " shall be an amount equal to the
lesser of (i) $38,500,000 (the " _Company Base Amount_ ") and (ii) the maximum
amount, if any, that can be paid to Parent without causing it to fail to meet
the requirements of Sections 856(c)(2) and (3) of the Code (the " _REIT
Requirements_ ") for such year determined as if (A) the payment of such amount
did not constitute Qualifying Income, and (B) Parent has 0.5% of its gross
income from unknown sources during such year which was not Qualifying Income
(in addition to any known

 



101  or anticipated income of Parent which was not Qualifying Income), in each
case as determined by independent accountants to Parent. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, in the event Parent receives Tax Guidance providing that Parents
receipt of the Company Base Amount would either constitute Qualifying Income
or would be excluded from gross income within the meaning of the REIT
Requirements, the Company Termination Fee shall be an amount equal to the
Company Base Amount and the Company shall, upon receiving notice that Parent
has received the Tax Guidance, pay to Parent the unpaid Company Base Amount
within five Business Days. In the event that Parent is not able to receive the
full Company Base Amount due to the above limitations, the Company shall
place the unpaid amount in escrow by wire transfer within three days of
termination and shall not release any portion thereof to Parent unless and
until Parent receives either one or a combination of the following once or
more often: (x) a letter from Parents independent accountants indicating the
maximum amount that can be paid at that time to Parent without causing Parent
to fail to meet the REIT Requirements (calculated as described above) or (y)
the Tax Guidance, in either of which events the Company shall pay to Parent
the lesser of the unpaid Company Base Amount or the maximum amount stated in
the letter referred to in clause (x) above within five Business Days after
the Company has been notified thereof. The obligation of the Company to pay
any unpaid portion of the Company Termination Fee shall terminate on the
December 31 following the date which is five years from the date of this
Agreement. Amounts remaining in escrow after the obligation of the Company to
pay the Company Termination Fee terminates shall be released to the Company. "
_Qualifying Income_ " shall mean income described in
Sections 856(c)(2)(A)(H) and 856(c)(3)(A)(I) of the Code. " _Tax Guidance_
" shall mean a reasoned opinion from outside counsel or a ruling from the IRS.

 

(g) The " _Parent Termination Fee_ " shall be an amount equal to the lesser of
(i) $38,500,000 (the " _Parent Base Amount_ ") and (ii) the maximum amount,
if any, that can be paid to the Company without causing it to fail to meet the
REIT Requirements for such year determined as if (A) the payment of such
amount did not constitute Qualifying Income, and (B) the Company has 0.5% of
its gross income from unknown sources during such year which was not
Qualifying Income (in addition to any known or anticipated income of the
Company which was not Qualifying Income), in each case as determined by
independent accountants to the Company. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the
event the Company receives Tax Guidance providing that the Companys receipt
of the Parent Base Amount would either constitute Qualifying Income or would
be excluded from gross income within the meaning of the REIT Requirements, the
Parent Termination Fee shall be an amount equal to the Parent Base Amount and
Parent shall, upon receiving notice that the Company has received the Tax
Guidance, pay to the Company the unpaid Parent Base Amount within five
Business Days. In the event that the Company is not able to receive the full
Parent Base Amount due to the above limitations, Parent shall place the unpaid
amount in escrow by wire transfer within three days of termination and shall
not release any portion thereof to the Company unless and until the Company
receives either one or a combination of the following once or more often: (x)
a letter from the Companys independent accountants indicating the maximum
amount that can be paid at that time to the Company without causing the
Company to fail to meet the REIT Requirements (calculated as described above)
or (y) the Tax Guidance, in either of which events Parent shall pay to the
Company the lesser of the unpaid Parent Base Amount or the maximum amount
stated in the letter referred to in clause (x) above within five Business Days
after Parent has been notified thereof. The obligation of Parent to pay any
unpaid portion of the Parent Termination Fee shall terminate on the December
31 following the date which is five years from the date of this

 



102  Agreement. Amounts remaining in escrow after the obligation of Parent to pay
the Parent Termination Fee terminates shall be released to Parent.

 

(h) The " _Parent Expense Reimbursement_ " shall be an amount equal to the
lesser of (i) the reasonable and documented out-of-pocket expenses incurred by
Parent in connection with this Agreement and the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement, in an amount not to exceed $15,000,000 (the " _Parent Expense
Reimbursement Base Amount_ ") and (ii) the maximum amount, if any, that can be
paid to Parent without causing it to fail to meet the REIT Requirements for
such year determined as if (A) the payment of such amount did not constitute
Qualifying Income, and (B) Parent has 0.5% of its gross income from unknown
sources during such year which was not Qualifying Income (in addition to any
known or anticipated income of Parent which was not Qualifying Income), in
each case as determined by independent accountants to Parent. Notwithstanding
the foregoing, in the event Parent receives Tax Guidance providing that
Parents receipt of the Parent Expense Reimbursement Base Amount would
either constitute Qualifying Income or would be excluded from gross income
within the meaning of the REIT Requirements, the Parent Expense Reimbursement
shall be an amount equal to the Parent Expense Reimbursement Base Amount and
the Company shall, upon receiving notice that Parent has received the Tax
Guidance, pay to Parent the unpaid Parent Expense Reimbursement Base Amount
within five Business Days. In the event that Parent is not able to receive the
full Parent Expense Reimbursement Base Amount due to the above limitations,
the Company shall place the unpaid amount in escrow by wire transfer within
three days of termination and shall not release any portion thereof to Parent
unless and until Parent receives either one or a combination of the following
once or more often: (x) a letter from Parents independent accountants
indicating the maximum amount that can be paid at that time to Parent without
causing Parent to fail to meet the REIT Requirements (calculated as described
above) or (y) the Tax Guidance, in either of which events the Company shall
pay to Parent the lesser of the unpaid Parent Expense Reimbursement Base
Amount or the maximum amount stated in the letter referred to in clause (x)
above within five Business Days after the Company has been notified thereof.
The obligation of the Company to pay any unpaid portion of the Parent Expense
Reimbursement shall terminate on the December 31 following the date which is
five years from the date of this Agreement. Amounts remaining in escrow after
the obligation of the Company to pay the Parent Expense Reimbursement
terminates shall be released to the Company.

 

(i) The " _Company Expense Reimbursement_ " shall be an amount equal to the
lesser of (i) the reasonable and documented out-of-pocket expenses incurred by
the Company in connection with this Agreement and the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, in an amount not to exceed $15,000,000 (the "
_Company Expense Reimbursement Base Amount_ ") and (ii) the maximum amount, if
any, that can be paid to the Company without causing it to fail to meet the
REIT Requirements for such year determined as if (A) the payment of such
amount did not constitute Qualifying Income, and (B) the Company has 0.5% of
its gross income from unknown sources during such year which was not
Qualifying Income (in addition to any known or anticipated income of the
Company which was not Qualifying Income), in each case as determined by
independent accountants to the Company. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the
event the Company receives Tax Guidance providing that the Companys receipt
of the Company Expense Reimbursement Base Amount would either constitute
Qualifying Income or would be excluded from gross income within the meaning of
the REIT Requirements, the

 



103  Company Expense Reimbursement shall be an amount equal to the Company
Expense Reimbursement Base Amount and Parent shall, upon receiving notice that
the Company has received the Tax Guidance, pay to the Company the unpaid
Company Expense Reimbursement Base Amount within five Business Days. In the
event that the Company is not able to receive the full Company Expense
Reimbursement Base Amount due to the above limitations, Parent shall
place the unpaid amount in escrow by wire transfer within three days of
termination and shall not release any portion thereof to the Company unless
and until the Company receives either one or a combination of the following
once or more often: (x) a letter from the Companys independent accountants
indicating the maximum amount that can be paid at that time to the Company
without causing the Company to fail to meet the REIT Requirements (calculated
as described above) or (y) the Tax Guidance, in either of which events Parent
shall pay to the Company the lesser of the unpaid Company Expense
Reimbursement Base Amount or the maximum amount stated in the letter referred
to in clause (x) above within five Business Days after Parent has been
notified thereof. The obligation of Parent to pay any unpaid portion of the
Company Expense Reimbursement shall terminate on the December 31 following the
date which is five years from the date of this Agreement. Amounts remaining
in escrow after the obligation of Parent to pay the Company Expense
Reimbursement terminates shall be released to Parent.

Sections, Exhibits or Schedules, such reference shall be to a Section of or
Exhibit or Schedule to this

 



105  Agreement unless otherwise indicated. The table of contents and headings
contained in this Agreement are for reference purposes only and shall not
affect in any way the meaning or interpretation of this Agreement. Whenever
the words "include," "includes" or "including" are used in this Agreement,
they shall be deemed to be followed by the words "without limitation." The
words "made available" in this Agreement shall mean that the information or
documents referred to have been provided to the receiving Party no later than
5:00 p.m. (California time) on the date which is one day prior to the date of
this Agreement by being posted in the electronic data room established by the
disclosing Party, or, in the case of any documents filed with the SEC, filed
by the disclosing Party at least two Business Days prior to the date of this

Agreement. Any pronoun shall include the corresponding masculine, feminine

Signatures to this Agreement transmitted by facsimile transmission, by

Section 8.6 _Entire Agreement; No Third-Party Beneficiaries_. This Agreement
(including the documents and the instruments referred to herein), together
with the Confidentiality Agreement, constitutes the entire agreement and
supersedes all prior agreements and understandings, both written and oral,
between the Parties with respect to the subject matter hereof. Except
as provided in _Section 5.9(e)_, this Agreement is not intended to confer
upon any Person other than the Parties any rights or remedies hereunder.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, each Financing Source in connection with the
Financing or the Debt Commitment Letter is an express third party beneficiary
of _Sections 8.2_ , _8.7_ , _8.11_ , _8.12_ , and this _8.6_ (and any
provision or definition of this Agreement to the extent a modification, waiver
or termination of such provision would modify the substance of any of the
foregoing provisions) and may enforce such sections directly.

Section 8.7  _Governing Law_.

(a) This Agreement, and all claims or causes of actions (whether at law, in
equity, in contract or in tort) that may be based upon, arise out of, or
relate to this Agreement, the negotiation, execution or performance of this
Agreement, or the transactions contemplated by

 



106  this Agreement, shall be governed by, and construed in accordance with, the
laws of the State of Delaware, without giving effect to conflicts-of-laws
principles (whether of the State of Delaware or any other jurisdiction that
would cause the application of the Laws of any jurisdiction other than
the State of Delaware).

(b) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, each party hereto
acknowledges and irrevocably agrees:

 

(i) that any action, claim, cause of action or suit (in contract or in tort or
otherwise), inquiry, proceeding or investigation involving any Financing
Source arising out of, or relating to, the transactions contemplated hereby,
any Financing or the performance of services thereunder or related thereto
(collectively, a " _Proceeding_ ") shall be subject to the
exclusive jurisdiction of the Supreme Court of the State of New York, County
of New York, Borough of Manhattan, or if under applicable Law exclusive
jurisdiction is vested in the federal courts, the United States District Court
for the Southern District of New York (and the appellate courts thereof) and
each party hereto submits for itself and its property with respect to any such
Proceeding to the exclusive jurisdiction of such court;

 

(ii) not to bring or permit any of their Affiliates to bring or support anyone
else in bringing any Proceeding in any other court;

 

(iii) that service of process, summons, notice or document by registered mail
addressed to them at their respective addresses provided in  _Section_ __ _
8.3_ shall be effective service of process against it for any such Proceeding
brought in any such court;

 

(iv) to waive and hereby waives, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable
Law, any objection which it may now or hereafter have to the laying of venue
of, and the defense of an inconvenient forum to the maintenance of, any such
Proceeding in any such court; and

(v) that a final judgment in any Proceeding shall be conclusive and may be
enforced in other jurisdictions by suit on the judgment or in any other manner
provided by applicable Law. Nothing in this paragraph shall affect or
eliminate any right to serve process in any other manner permitted by
applicable Laws.

Section 8.8 _Severability_. Any term or provision (or part thereof) of this
Agreement which is invalid or unenforceable in any jurisdiction shall, as to
that jurisdiction, be ineffective to the extent of such invalidity or
unenforceability and, unless the effect of such invalidity or unenforceability
would prevent the Parties from realizing the major portion of the economic
benefits of the Merger that they currently anticipate obtaining therefrom,
shall not render invalid or unenforceable the remaining terms and provisions
(or parts thereof) of this Agreement or affect the validity or enforceability
of any of the terms or provisions (or parts thereof) of this Agreement in any
other jurisdiction. If any term or provision (or part thereof) of this
Agreement is so broad as to be unenforceable, the provision shall be
interpreted to be only so broad as is enforceable.

Section 8.9 _Assignment_. Neither this Agreement nor any of the rights,
interests or obligations of the Parties hereunder shall be assigned by any of
the Parties (whether by operation

 



107  of law or otherwise) without the prior written consent of the other Party,
and any attempt to make any such assignment without such consent shall be null
and void, provided, however, that Merger Sub may assign, in its sole
discretion and without the consent of the Company, any or all of its rights,
interests and obligations hereunder to one or more direct or indirect wholly-
owned Subsidiaries of Parent. Subject to the preceding sentence, this
Agreement will be binding upon, inure to the benefit of and be enforceable by
the Parties and their respective successors and permitted assigns.

proceedings arising out of or relating to this Agreement, the negotiation,
execution or performance of this Agreement, or the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement, except as provided in _Section 8.7(b)_ above, shall be

Castle County and any state appellate court therefrom (or, if the Delaware
Court of Chancery declines to accept jurisdiction over any matter, any other
Delaware state or federal court), and each of the parties hereby
irrevocably submits to the exclusive jurisdiction of the aforesaid courts for
itself and with respect to its property, generally and unconditionally, with
regard to any such Legal Proceeding arising out of or relating to this
Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby. Each of the parties agrees
not to commence any such Legal Proceeding except as and in the courts
described above in Delaware, other than actions in any court of competent
jurisdiction to enforce any judgment, decree or award rendered by any such
court in Delaware as described in this Agreement. Each of the parties further
agrees that notice delivered as provided in this Agreement shall constitute
sufficient service of process for purposes of any Legal Proceeding brought by
any party or its affiliates or successors or assigns, and the parties further
waive any argument that such service is insufficient. Each of the parties
hereby irrevocably and unconditionally waives, and agrees not to assert, by
way of motion or as a defense, counterclaim or otherwise, in any Legal
Proceeding arising out of or relating to this Agreement or the transactions
contemplated hereby, (i) any claim that it is not personally subject to the
jurisdiction of the courts in Delaware as described in this Agreement for any
reason (other than a failure to serve process as described in the immediately
preceding sentence), (ii) that it or its property is exempt or immune from
jurisdiction of any such court or from any legal process commenced in such
courts (whether through service of notice, attachment prior to judgment,
attachment in aid of execution of judgment, execution of judgment or
otherwise) and (iii) that (A) the Legal Proceeding in any such court is
brought in an inconvenient forum, (B) the venue of such Legal Proceeding is
improper or (C) this Agreement, or the subject matter of this Agreement, may
not be enforced in or by such courts.

 

Section 8.11 _Enforcement_ _; Remedies_.

 

(a) Except as otherwise provided herein, any and all remedies herein expressly
conferred upon a Party will be deemed cumulative with and not exclusive of
any other remedy conferred hereby, or by Law or equity upon such Party, and
the exercise by a Party of any one remedy will not preclude the exercise of
any other remedy.

 

(b) The Parties agree that irreparable damage would occur in the event that
any provisions of this Agreement is not performed in accordance with its
specific terms or is otherwise breached. Prior to the termination of this
Agreement pursuant to _Article VII_, the non-breaching Party shall be
entitled to an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of this

 



108  Agreement by any other Party and to specifically enforce the terms and
provisions of this Agreement.

 

(c) The Parties right of specific enforcement is an integral part of the
Merger and other transactions contemplated by this Agreement and each Party
hereby waives any objections to the grant of the equitable remedy of specific
performance to prevent or restrain breaches of this Agreement by any other
Party (including any objection on the basis that there is an adequate remedy
at Law or that an award of specific performance is not an appropriate remedy
for any reason at Law or equity), and each Party shall be entitled to an
injunction or injunctions and to specifically enforce the terms and provisions
of this Agreement to prevent or restrain breaches or threatened breaches of,
or to enforce compliance with, the covenants and obligations of such Party
under this Agreement all in accordance with the terms of this _Section_ __ _
8.11_. In the event that any Party seeks an injunction or injunctions to
prevent breaches of this Agreement, or to enforce specifically the terms and
provisions of this Agreement, such Party shall not be required to provide any
bond or other security in connection with such order or injunction.

Section 8.12 _WAIVER_ _OF JURY TRIAL_. EACH PARTY HEREBY IRREVOCABLY AND
UNCONDITIONALLY WAIVES ANY RIGHT IT MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN RESPECT OF
ANY LITIGATION DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS
AGREEMENT, THE NEGOTIATION, EXECUTION OR PERFORMANCE OF THIS AGREEMENT, ANY
FINANCING (OR AGAINST ANY FINANCING SOURCE) OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED
BY THIS AGREEMENT. EACH PARTY CERTIFIES AND ACKNOWLEDGES THAT (A) NO
REPRESENTATIVE, AGENT OR ATTORNEY OF ANY OTHER PARTY HAS REPRESENTED,
EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE, THAT SUCH OTHER PARTY WOULD NOT, IN THE EVENT
OF LITIGATION, SEEK TO ENFORCE SUCH WAIVERS, (B) IT UNDERSTANDS AND HAS
CONSIDERED THE IMPLICATIONS OF SUCH WAIVERS, (C) IT MAKES SUCH WAIVERS
VOLUNTARILY, AND (D) IT HAS BEEN INDUCED TO ENTER INTO THIS AGREEMENT BY,
AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE MUTUAL WAIVERS AND CERTIFICATIONS IN THIS _SECTION
8.12_.

Section 8.13 _Financing Sources_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
contained herein, the Company (on behalf of itself and its Affiliates and each
officer, director, employee, member, manager, partner, controlling person,
advisor, attorney, agent and representative thereof (as each of the

_Members_ ").

The Member desires to form a limited liability company pursuant to the laws of
the State of Delaware. Accordingly, in consideration of the covenants
contained herein, it is agreed as follows:

_ARTICLE I_

 

 _ORGANIZATION_

 

1.1. Formation. The Member, by execution of this Agreement, hereby forms a
limited liability company pursuant to and in accordance with the Delaware

the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware, which filing is hereby
ratified and approved. Upon the filing of the Certificate of Formation with
the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware, his powers as an "authorized
person" of the Company ceased, and the Managing Member (as defined in 
_Section_ __ _ 3.1.1_) and each Officer (as defined in _Section_ __ _
3.1.3_) thereupon became a designated "authorized person" of the Company and
shall continue as the designated "authorized person" of the Company within
the meaning of the Act. The Managing Member or any Officer, as an "authorized
person" of the Company within the meaning of the Act, shall execute, deliver
and file, or cause the execution, delivery and filing of, all certificates
(and any amendments and/or restatements thereof) required or permitted by the
Act to be filed with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware. Pursuant
to Section 18-201(d) of the Act, this Agreement shall be effective as of the
time of the filing of the Certificate of Formation of the company with the
Office of the Delaware Secretary of State on May 4, 2017.

1.3. Name. The name of the Company is "PR Sub, LLC".

 

1.4. Purpose; Powers. The purpose of the Company is to engage in any lawful
activity for which a limited liability company may be formed under the Act.
The Company, and the Managing Member and the Officers on behalf of the
Company, (i) shall have and exercise all powers necessary, convenient or
incidental to accomplish its purposes as set forth in this  _Section_ __ _
2_,  and (ii) shall have and exercise all of the powers and rights conferred upon
limited liability companies formed pursuant to the Act.

 

1.5. Principal Office. The principal office of the Company shall be located at

the event the registered agent ceases to act as such for any reason or the
registered office shall change, the Managing Member shall promptly designate a
replacement registered agent or registered office through an appropriate
filing with the Delaware Secretary of State.

1.7. Qualification in Other Jurisdictions. The Managing Member shall cause
the Company to be qualified, formed or registered under assumed or fictitious
names statutes or similar laws in each jurisdiction in which the Company

written notice

 



2  stating the place, date and time of such meeting shall be given to each
Member not less than five (5) business days before the date of the meeting.
Attendance of a Member at a meeting shall constitute a waiver of notice of
such meeting, except when the Member attends for the express purpose of
objecting at the beginning of the meeting to the transaction of any business
because the meeting is not lawfully called or convened. The holders of at
least a majority of the Percentage Interests of all Members, represented in
person or by proxy, shall constitute a quorum at all meetings of the Members.

transmission or by any other means permitted by law, by Members having not
less than the minimum Percentage Interests that would be necessary
to authorize or take such action at a meeting at which all Percentage
Interests entitled to vote thereon were present and voted. Prompt notice of
the taking of the action without a meeting by less than unanimous written
consent shall be given to the Members that have not consented in writing. Any
action taken by written consent of the Members shall have the same force and
effect as if taken by the Members at a meeting thereof.

 

 _ARTICLE III_

 

 _MANAGEMENT_

3.1. Managing Member.

3.1.1. _Management by Member._ The business and affairs of the Company shall
be managed by Parent, as the initial managing member of the Company (and each
successor that is appointed as the Managing Member in accordance with this
Agreement, each in its capacity as a managing member of the Company, being
referred to herein as a "Managing Member"), and all decisions to be made on
behalf of the Company and, unless otherwise provided herein, all actions to be
taken on behalf of the Company shall be made or taken by the Managing Member
and no other person or entity shall have the power or authority under this
Agreement to make any decisions or take any actions on behalf of the Company.
The Managing Member shall have the power to do any and all acts necessary,
convenient or incidental to or for the furtherance of the purposes described
herein, including all powers, statutory or otherwise. To the extent of its
powers set forth in this Agreement, the Managing Member is an agent of the
Company for the purpose of the Companys business, and the actions of
the Managing Member taken in accordance with such powers set forth in this
Agreement shall bind the Company. Notwithstanding any other provision of this
Agreement, the Manager Member is authorized to execute and deliver any
document on behalf of the Company without any vote or consent of any other
Member, person or entity. Without limiting the foregoing, the Managing Member
shall have the sole authority to execute and/or deliver, in furtherance of the
Company business, any deed of trust, promissory note, bill of sale, contract
or other instrument purporting to convey, exchange or encumber any Company
asset. The Managing Member shall not be removed or replaced and its duties
shall not be limited by any action taken by or on behalf of any other Member,
other than upon the affirmative vote of at least a majority of the Percentage
Interests of all Members. The Managing Member or the Members may call a
meeting of the Members from time to time in accordance with  _Section_ __ _
2.3_.

 



3 3.1.2. _Right to Rely on the Managing Members_. Any person or entity dealing
with the Company may rely upon a certificate signed by the Managing Member as
to:

(A) the identity of the Managing Member and the Members;

 

(B) the existence or nonexistence of any fact or facts, which constitute a
condition precedent to acts by the Managing Member or which are in any other
manner germane to the affairs of the Company;

(C) the persons or entities who are authorized to execute and deliver
any instrument or document of the Company; or

(D) any act or failure to act by the Company or any other matter whatsoever
involving the Company or any Member.

3.1.3. _Officers and Related Persons_. The Managing Member may, from time to
time as it deems advisable, appoint officers of the Company (the " _Officers_
") and assign in writing any titles (including, without limitation, President,
Chief Executive Officer, Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer,
Chief Investment Officer, Vice President, Secretary and Treasurer) to any
such person. Unless the Managing Member decides otherwise, if the title
assigned to an Officer is one commonly used for officers of a business
corporation formed under the General Corporation Law of the State of
Delaware, the assignment of such title shall constitute the delegation to such
person of the authorities and duties that are normally associated with that
office. Any delegation pursuant to this  _Section_ __ _ 3.1.3_ may be
revoked at any time by the Managing Member. An Officer may be removed with or
without cause at any time by the Manager Member. The Managing Member may
delegate to any Officer any of the Managing Members powers under this
Agreement, including, without limitation, the power to bind the Company. All
Officers of the Company have the power, acting individually or jointly, to
represent and bind the Company in all matters as provided in this Agreement
or in a resolution of the Managing Member. All instruments, contracts,
agreements and documents executed by such Officers in their capacities as
officers of the Company shall be valid and binding on the Company.

 

 _ARTICLE IV_

Member. A Member may, at any time, make or cause a loan to be made to the
Company in any amount and on those terms upon which the Company and the Member
shall agree.

 

4.2. Interest on and Return of Capital Contributions. No interest shall accrue
on any capital contribution and no Member shall have the right to withdraw or
be repaid any capital contribution except as otherwise provided in this
Agreement. If a Member is entitled to receive a return of a capital
contribution, the Company may subject to the Act, in the sole discretion of
the Managing Member, distribute cash, notes, property, or a combination
thereof to the Member in return of the capital contribution.

 



4 4.3. Distributions. Each distribution to a Member of cash or other assets of
the Company shall be made in accordance with their respective Percentage
Interests in such amounts and at such times as shall be determined by the
approval of the Managing Member. Unless the Managing Member otherwise
establishes, the Companys distribution of assets to a Member shall be valued
on the basis of the fair market value of such assets, which may be determined
by an independent appraiser who shall be selected by the Managing Member.
Notwithstanding any provision to the contrary contained in this Agreement,
the Company shall not make a distribution to a Member on account of its
interest in the Company if such distribution would violate the Act or other
applicable law.

 

4.4. Tax Treatment. Each Member will treat its share of the profits and losses
of the Company as its own profits and losses for federal income tax purposes
and state income tax purposes where applicable. Unless otherwise determined by

execution of a counterpart to this Agreement, automatically be admitted to the
Company as a member of the Company effective as of such sale, transfer, or
other disposition pursuant to the exercise of foreclosure rights, be admitted

written consent of the Managing Member.

discretion. A person or entity shall be admitted to the Company as an

7.1. Limited Liability. Except as otherwise provided by the Act, the debts,
obligations and liabilities of the Company, whether arising in contract, tort

Covered Person reasonably believes are within such other persons or entitys
professional or expert competence, including information, opinions, reports
or statements as to the value and amount of the assets, liabilities, profits
or losses of the Company, or the value and amount of assets or reserves or
contracts, agreements or other undertakings that would be sufficient to
pay claims and obligations of the Company or to make reasonable provision to
pay such claims and obligations, or any other facts pertinent to the existence
and amount of assets from which distributions to Members or creditors might
properly be paid. 

7.3. Indemnification. To the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, a
Covered Person shall be entitled to indemnification from the Company for any
loss, damage or claim incurred by such Covered Person by reason of any act or

indemnities, regardless of whether the Company would have the power to
indemnify such person or entity against such liability under the provisions
of this Agreement. The Managing Member and the Company may enter into
indemnity contracts with Covered Persons and such other persons or entities as
the Managing Member shall determine and may adopt written procedures pursuant
to which arrangements are made for the advancement of expenses and the
funding of obligations under _Section_ __ _ 7.4_ and containing such other

initiated, whether or not such ventures are competitive with the Company, and
the doctrine of corporate opportunity, or any analogous doctrine, shall not
apply to any Member. To the fullest extent permitted by law and
notwithstanding any duty (including any fiduciary duty) otherwise existing at

Member) pursues or acquires for, or directs such opportunity to another person
or entity or does not communicate such opportunity or information to the
Company. To the fullest extent permitted by law, neither the Company nor any
Member (including the Managing Member) shall have any rights or obligations
by virtue of this Agreement or the relationship created hereby in or to such

Company, shall not be deemed wrongful, improper or the breach of any duty
(fiduciary or otherwise) to the Company or any Member (including the Managing
Member) or any other person or entity otherwise bound by this Agreement
existing at law, in equity or otherwise.
