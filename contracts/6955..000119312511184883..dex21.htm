W. Monroe Street, Chicago, IL 60606, at 9:00 a.m. (local time) on the later

deemed to have been taken and executed simultaneously as of 12:01 A.M. on the
Closing Date and no proceedings will be deemed to have been taken nor
documents executed or delivered until all have been taken, executed and

11 2.5 _Adjustment Amount_.

 

(a) As soon as reasonably practicable following the Closing Date, and in any
event within sixty (60) calendar days thereof, Buyer shall prepare and
deliver to Seller a statement (the "Closing Date Statement") of the Net
Working Capital as of the close of business on the day immediately preceding
the Closing Date, determined in accordance with the Accounting Principles and
without giving effect to the consummation of the Acquisition or any financing
transactions in connection therewith ("Closing Date Net Working Capital") and
of the Closing Cash, together with related supporting schedules, calculations
and documentation. A sample Closing Date Statement is attached hereto as
_Exhibit D_ for illustrative purposes only. Following the Closing, Buyer shall
provide Seller and its representatives access to the records, properties and
personnel of the Company and its Subsidiaries relating to the preparation of
the Closing Date Statement and shall cause the personnel of the Company and
its Subsidiaries to reasonably cooperate with Seller in connection with
its review of the Closing Date Statement.

(b) If Seller shall disagree with the calculation of Closing Date Net Working
Capital and/or Closing Cash, it shall notify Buyer of such disagreement in
writing (the "Sellers Objection"), setting forth in reasonable detail the
particulars of such disagreement, within thirty (30) days after its receipt
of the Closing Date Statement. In the event that Seller does not provide such
a notice of disagreement within such thirty (30)-day period, Seller shall be
deemed to have accepted the Closing Date Statement and the calculation of
Closing Date Net Working Capital and Closing Cash delivered by Buyer, which
shall be final, binding and conclusive for all purposes hereunder. In the
event any such notice of disagreement is timely provided, Buyer and Seller
shall use reasonable best efforts for a period of thirty (30) days (or such
longer period as they may mutually agree) to resolve any disagreements with
respect to the calculations of Closing Date Net Working Capital and Closing
Cash. If, at the end of such period, they are unable to resolve such
disagreements, then Ernst and Young (or such independent accounting or financial
consulting firm of recognized national standing as may be mutually selected by
Buyer and Seller) (the "Auditor") shall resolve any remaining disagreements.
The Auditor shall be instructed only to resolve all outstanding disagreements
relating to the calculation of the Closing Date Net Working Capital and
Closing Cash. The Auditor shall investigate only those items which are
in dispute and shall not assign a value to any item that is (A) greater than
the greatest value for such item claimed by either of Buyer or Seller or (B)
lower than the lowest value for such item claimed by either of Buyer or
Seller. The Auditors determination shall be based only upon written
submissions by Buyer and Seller, and not upon an independent review by the
Auditor. The Parties shall instruct the Auditor to render its determination
within thirty (30) days of the referral of such matter thereto, and the
determination of the Auditor shall be final, binding and non-appealable upon
all parties for all purposes of this Agreement. None of Seller, Buyer or the
Company shall have any ex parte communications or meetings with the Auditor
without the prior consent of Buyer (in the case of Seller) or Seller (in the
case of Buyer or the Company), other than pursuant to a request therefor from
the Auditor. If Seller delivers a Sellers Objection, the fees, costs and
expenses of the Auditor shall be paid (i) by the Seller if the items covered
thereby are resolved in favor of Buyer or (ii) by Buyer if the items covered
thereby are resolved in favor of the Sellers Objection. If the
items referred to therein are resolved in part in favor of the Sellers
Objection and in part in favor of Buyer, such fees, costs and expenses shall
be allocated between Seller and Buyer in inverse proportion as Seller and
Buyer may prevail on matters resolved by the Auditor, which proportionate
allocations shall be determined by the

 



12  Auditor; provided, however, that neither Seller nor Buyer shall be
considered the prevailing party with respect to any matter resolved by the
Auditor if Sellers Objection giving rise thereto resulted from Buyers
failure to provide Seller with the records, properties, personnel and auditors
back-up or supporting data relating to the preparation of the Closing Date
Statement reasonably requested by Seller in accordance with this Section 2.5.
The date on which Closing Date Net Working Capital and Closing Cash are
finally determined in accordance with this Section 2.5(b) is hereinafter
referred to as the "Determination Date."

 

(c) The "Adjustment Amount," which may be positive or negative, shall mean the
Purchase Price _minus_ the Closing Payment.

(d) If the Adjustment Amount is a positive number, then, promptly following
the Determination Date, and in any event within five (5) Business Days of the
Determination Date, Buyer shall pay to Seller, by wire transfer of immediately
available funds to the account designated pursuant to Section 2.3, an amount
equal to such Adjustment Amount together with interest thereon at the
Applicable Rate, accrued and calculated on the basis of the actual number of
days elapsed over 360, from the Closing Date until the date of distribution.
If the Adjustment Amount is a negative number, then, promptly following the
Determination Date, and in any event within five (5) Business Days of the
Determination Date, the Escrow Agent shall pay to Buyer, by wire transfer of
immediately available funds, out of the Escrow Funds an amount equal to the
lesser of (i) the absolute value of such Adjustment Amount (the "Repayment
Amount") (together with any interest thereon at the Applicable Rate, accrued
and calculated on the basis of the actual number of days elapsed over 360,
from the Closing Date until the date of distribution) and (ii) $2,000,000. If
the Repayment Amount exceeds $2,000,000, Seller shall pay the amount of the
excess to Buyer, by wire transfer of immediately available funds. If the
Adjustment Amount results in a Repayment Amount, each of Buyer and Seller
shall promptly execute joint written instructions to the Escrow Agent
instructing the Escrow Agent to disburse the Escrow Funds in accordance with
this Section 2.5(d).

Material Adverse Effect. The execution, delivery and performance by the
Company of this Agreement and the other Company

Agreement does not, and the consummation of the transactions contemplated

any other Persons intellectual property rights). To the Knowledge of the
Company, no other Person has interfered with, infringed upon, misappropriated,
or otherwise come into conflict with any Intellectual Property rights of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries. There are no pending or, to the Knowledge
of the Company, threatened claims against any the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries or any employees or independent contractors thereof alleging that
any of the Intellectual Property infringes on or conflicts with the rights of
any other Person. Each employee of the Company and its Subsidiaries set forth

plan as defined in Sections 3(1) and 3(2) of the Employee Retirement Income
Security Act of 1974, as amended and the regulations promulgated thereunder
(collectively, "ERISA"), including plans that provide retirement income or
result in a deferral of income by employees for periods extending to
termination of employment or beyond, and plans that provide medical,
surgical, or hospital care benefits or benefits in the event of sickness,
accident, disability, death, or unemployment,

 



17  and (b) all other material employee benefit agreements or arrangements,
whether or not subject to ERISA, including deferred compensation plans,
incentive plans, bonus plans or arrangements, stock option plans, stock
purchase plans, stock award plans, golden parachute agreements, severance pay
plans, dependent care plans, cafeteria plans, employee assistance programs,
scholarship programs, employment contracts, vacation policies, and other
similar plans, agreements, and arrangements that are currently in effect, or
have been approved by the Company before the date hereof but are not yet
effective, for the benefit of current or former directors, officers, employees
(or their beneficiaries) of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or to
which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is a sponsor, a contributor or a
party or by which it is bound. All Plans are listed in Section 3.11(a) of the
Disclosure Schedule. The Company has made available to Buyer true and
complete copies of all written Plans and true and fair descriptions of all
unwritten Plans.

(b) Each Plan is in compliance in all material respects with its terms and
with ERISA and other applicable laws.

(c) Except as disclosed in Section 3.11(c) of the Disclosure Schedule, (i) no
Plan is or has ever been covered by Title IV of ERISA or subject to Section
412 of the Code, and (ii) neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has
contributed to or been obligated to contribute to any plan subject to Title IV

Subsidiaries related to the withdrawal from any Plan is fully accrued on the
Balance Sheet.

(d) Each Plan that is intended to qualify under Section 401(a) of the Code
has an opinion letter or determination letter from the IRS as to its qualified
status under Section 401(a) of the Code on which it can rely. To the Companys
Knowledge, no facts have occurred that if known by the IRS would reasonably
be expected to result in disqualification of any of those plans. To the
Knowledge of the Company, no non-exempt "prohibited transaction" (as defined
in Section 4975 of the Code or Section 406 of ERISA) has occurred which
involves the assets of any Plan which would subject the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries to the Tax or penalty on prohibited transactions imposed by
Section 4975 of the Code or the sanctions imposed under Title I of ERISA.

 

(e) All premiums required to be paid, all benefits, expenses and other amounts

made to or under the Plans will have been paid, made, or accrued as of the
Closing Date for all services on or prior to the Closing Date.

(f) Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has maintained or
contributed, or been required to contribute, to any Plan providing medical,

the Company and its Subsidiaries will give Buyer and its agents and authorized
representatives (including prospective lenders) reasonable access to all
offices, facilities, books and records, officers, employees and advisors
(including audit and tax working papers prepared by its independent
accountants, provided that Buyer will execute releases reasonably requested by
the independent accountants if requested to do so) of the Company and its
Subsidiaries as Buyer may reasonably request during normal business hours;
provided, however, that any such access shall be conducted in a manner not to
unreasonably interfere with the business or operations of the Company.

(b) Any information provided to or obtained by Buyer pursuant to
paragraph (a) above shall be subject to the Confidentiality Agreement dated
February 3, 2011, between the Robert W. Baird and Co. and Buyer (the
"Confidentiality Agreement"), and shall be held by Buyer in accordance with
and be subject to the terms of the Confidentiality Agreement. Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary herein, the terms and provisions of the
Confidentiality Agreement shall survive the termination of this Agreement in
accordance with the terms therein. In the event of the termination of this
Agreement for any reason, Buyer shall comply with the terms and provisions of
the Confidentiality Agreement, including returning or destroying all
Evaluation Material and not soliciting employees of the Company or its
Subsidiaries.

 



29 6.3 _Reasonable Best Efforts_. Subject to the terms and conditions of this
Agreement, each of the parties hereto will use its reasonable best efforts to
take, or cause to be taken, all actions, and to do, or cause to be done, all
things necessary, proper or advisable under applicable laws and regulations to
consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. The Company will
use its reasonable best efforts to deliver to Buyer a commitment for an ALTA
Owners Standard Coverage Title Insurance Policy with respect to all Owned
Real Property, issued by Chicago Title Insurance Company (the "Title
Company"), insuring the Companys fee simple title, free and clear of all
Liens other than Real Estate Permitted Liens in each Owned Real Property in
such amounts as reasonably determined by Buyer (but, in the case of the Real
Property located in Wisconsin, in the amount of $2,500,000) (the "Real
Property Title Policies"). The Company shall fund the premium for the Real
Property Title Policies at or prior to the Closing, provide the Title Company
with a standard Owners Title Affidavit dated the date of the Closing, and
provide releases, in recordable form, to the Title Company, sufficient to
release all monetary liens which are not Permitted Liens.

6.4 _Consents_. The Company and Buyer will each use its reasonable best
efforts to obtain all licenses, permits, authorizations, consents and
approvals of all third parties and Governmental Authorities necessary in
connection with the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement prior to the Closing. The parties hereto will reasonably coordinate
and cooperate with each other in exchanging such information and assistance as
any of the parties hereto may reasonably request in connection with the
foregoing.

6.5 _Public Announcements_. The parties hereto shall not issue any report,
statement or press release or otherwise make any public statement with respect
to this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby without prior
consultation with and approval of the other parties, except as may be required
by law, in which case such party shall advise the other parties and discuss
the contents of the disclosure before issuing any such report, statement or
press release. Following the execution and delivery of this Agreement, Buyer
may make such public disclosure as required or deemed appropriate by Buyer,
subject to the consent of Seller, not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed;
provided that, if Buyer is required by the SEC to include a copy of this
Agreement as an exhibit to an SEC filing, such filing will be redacted in the
form attached as _Exhibit G_ , provided, that if the SEC requires disclosure
of any redacted provision, the Parties shall coordinate to limit such
disclosure to the extent reasonably possible.

6.6 _Filings and Authorizations; Consummation_. (a) Each of the parties
hereto shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to file or supply, cause
to be filed or supplied, all filings and information required to be filed or
supplied pursuant to the HSR Act to consummate the transactions contemplated
herein not provided prior to the date hereof. The parties hereto shall
reasonably coordinate and cooperate with one another in exchanging such
information and supplying such reasonable assistance as may be reasonably
requested by each in connection with the foregoing.

(b) Each of the parties hereto shall promptly inform the other party of any
material communication between itself and any Governmental Authority with
respect to the transactions contemplated hereby. If any party receives any
formal or informal request for supplemental information or
documentary material from any Governmental Authority with respect to the
transactions contemplated hereby, then such party shall use commercially
reasonable efforts to cause to be made, as soon as reasonably practical, a
response in compliance with such request.

 



30 (c) Without limiting the foregoing, Buyer shall use commercially reasonable
efforts to cooperate in good faith with all Governmental Authorities and to
avoid, prevent, eliminate or remove the actual or threatened commencement of
any proceeding in any forum by or on behalf of any Governmental Authority or
the issuance of any Order that would delay, enjoin, prevent, restrain or
otherwise prohibit the consummation of the Merger.

(d) The Buyer and Seller shall each be liable for and pay 50% of all
applicable fees relating to the HSR filings contemplated by this Agreement.

6.7  _Notice of Events_. (a) During the period from the date hereof to the
Closing Date or the earlier termination of this Agreement, Seller shall
promptly notify Buyer in writing if, to the Companys Knowledge, there shall
be (i) the occurrence or non-occurrence of any event which has caused any of
its or the Companys representations or warranties contained herein to be
untrue or inaccurate in any material respect and (ii) any material failure on
the part of the Company or the Seller to comply with or satisfy any covenant,
condition or agreement to be complied with or satisfied by it hereunder.
Should any such event, fact or condition require any change to the Disclosure
Schedule, Seller shall promptly deliver to Buyer a supplement to the
Disclosure Schedule providing a reasonably detailed description of such
change. In the event that Seller delivers one or more supplements to the
Disclosure Schedule pursuant to this Section 6.7(a) that reflect any events,
facts or conditions that first occur or arise after the date of this Agreement
which individually or in the aggregate would cause the condition set forth in
Section 7.2(a) or 7.2(g) not to be satisfied, Buyer shall have the right to
terminate this Agreement by written notice to that effect (specifying the
basis for such termination); provided that, if Buyer does not exercise such
right to terminate this Agreement, (i) Buyer will be deemed to have accepted
such supplements to the Disclosure Schedule, (ii) the delivery of any such
supplement will be deemed to have cured any misrepresentation or breach of
warranty that otherwise might have existed hereunder by reason of such events,
fact or condition and (iii) from and after the Closing Date, Buyer will not
have any claim for indemnification for any such events, facts or conditions.

(b) During the period from the date hereof to the Closing Date or the earlier
termination of this Agreement, Buyer shall promptly notify the Seller in
writing if Buyer becomes aware of (i) the occurrence or non-occurrence of any
event or the existence of any fact or condition that would cause or constitute
a breach of any of its representations or warranties had any such
representation or warranty been made as of the time of Buyers discovery of
such event, fact or condition and (ii) any material failure on its part to
comply with or satisfy any covenant, condition or agreement to be complied
with or satisfied by it hereunder.

 

6.8 _Officer and Director Indemnification and Insurance_. (a) Prior to the
Closing, the Company shall convert and fully pay for the Companys existing
directors and officers liability insurance coverage for the Companys
directors and officers (each, a "DandO Indemnified Person") to a run-off policy
which shall provide such directors and officers with coverage for six (6)
years following the Closing of not less than the existing coverage under, and
have other terms not materially less favorable to the insured persons than,
the directors and 

 



31  officers liability insurance coverage presently maintained by the Company
(the "Run-Off Policy"). From and after the Closing Date until the sixth
anniversary thereof, the Buyer and the Company shall not, without the written
consent of the Seller, take any action to (i) cancel, amend or shorten the
term of the Run-Off Policy or (ii) amend or terminate the indemnification
provisions of the organizational documents as in effect immediately prior to
the Closing in any manner that would be reasonably expected to be adverse to
any former officer or director of the Company or its Subsidiaries. The rights
of each DandO Indemnified Person under this Section 6.8 shall survive the
Closing and are intended to benefit, and shall be enforceable by, each DandO
Indemnified Person.

(b) If after the Closing the Company (i) consolidates with or merges into any
other Person and shall not be the continuing or surviving corporation or
entity of such consolidation or merger, or (ii) transfers or conveys all or
substantially all of its properties and assets to any Person, then, and in
each such case, to the extent necessary, proper provision shall be made so
that the successors and assigns of the Company shall assume the obligations
set forth in this Section 6.8.

6.9 _Tax Covenants_. (a) All Tax Returns of the Company and its Subsidiaries
not required to be filed on or before the date hereof (i) will, to the extent
required to be filed on or before the Closing Date, be filed when due in
accordance with all Applicable Laws, and (ii) as of the time of filing, will
be correct and complete in all material respects. The Company and its
Subsidiaries shall timely pay the amount of Taxes shown as due on the Tax
Returns that are filed pursuant to this Section 6.9(a).

 

(b) Buyer shall prepare or cause to be prepared and file or cause to be filed
all Tax Returns for the Company and its Subsidiaries that are filed after the
Closing Date. Buyer shall provide a copy of each Tax Return for any period
that begins on or prior to the Closing Date to the Parent prior to the
deadline for filing each such Tax Return, shall give the Parent no less than
14 days to review any such Tax Return and shall make any changes reasonably
requested by the Parent with respect to the period prior to the Closing.
Buyer, Company and its Subsidiaries, and Seller shall cooperate fully, as and
to the extent reasonably requested by the other Party, in connection with the
filing of Tax Returns pursuant to this Section 6.9(b) and any audit,
litigation or other proceeding with respect to Taxes.

 

(c) As provided herein, Seller will be entitled to the economic benefit of any
tax deductions that arise or become available as a result of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, including deductions attributable to the
exercise or payment of options, any transaction bonuses or other like
payments, Selling Expenses and other transaction fees and any write-offs
of capitalized expenses in connection with any debt discharged ("Transaction
Deductions"). Buyer and the Company agree that the Company and its
Subsidiaries shall carry back any net operating loss, capital loss and credit
from the tax period that ends on the Closing Date to prior taxable years to
the extent permitted by law (using any available short-form or accelerated
procedures (including filing IRS Form 1139 and any corresponding form for
applicable state, local and foreign tax purposes) and filing amended Tax
Returns to the extent necessary) and obtain any potential Tax refunds related
thereto. Such refund, to the extent attributable to the Transaction
Deductions, shall be paid to the Seller within 5 days of receipt thereof. If
the Company or its Subsidiaries have a net operating loss for federal or state
income

 



32  Tax purposes for the period or portion thereof ending on the Closing Date
(calculated on a closing of the books method) and such net operating loss
actually reduces Buyers federal or state income Tax liability, the Tax
benefit so realized by Buyer to the extent attributable to Transaction
Deductions shall be for the account of Seller and shall be paid by the Buyer,
the Company or its Subsidiaries to Seller within 10 Business Days of filing
of the applicable Tax Return in which such benefit is realized.

(d) Any refund, rebate, abatement, credit or other recovery of Taxes of the
Company or its Subsidiaries (including under Section 6.9(c)) and any interest
thereon paid by the applicable taxing authority to the Company and its
Subsidiaries (less any Taxes, costs or expenses incurred by the Company and
its Subsidiaries with respect thereto) (collectively, a "Tax Refund") with
respect to all taxable years or periods that end on or before the Closing Date
(including the pre-Closing portion of the year that includes the Closing Date
(as determined on a closing of the books basis) shall be for the account of
the Seller, and shall be paid by the Company and its Subsidiaries, to the
Seller.

(e) Except as provided in Section 6.9(c), without the prior written consent of
the Seller which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed, or as
otherwise required by Applicable Law, after the Closing neither the Company
or any of its Subsidiaries shall file any amended Tax Return with respect to
any period that ends on or before the Closing Date, if in any such case such
action would have the effect of increasing the indemnification obligations of
Seller.

6.10 _No Solicitation or Negotiation_. Each of the Seller and the Company
agrees that between the date of this Agreement and the earlier of (a) the
Closing and (b) the termination of this Agreement, none of the Seller, the
Company or its Subsidiaries will (i) solicit, initiate, consider, encourage or
accept any other proposals or offers from any Person (A) relating to any
acquisition or purchase of all or any portion of the equity of the Company or
its Subsidiaries or all or a substantial portion of the assets of the Company
or its Subsidiaries, (B) to enter into any merger, consolidation or other
business combination with the Company or its Subsidiaries or (C) to enter into
a recapitalization, reorganization or any other extraordinary business
transaction involving or otherwise relating to the Company or its
Subsidiaries or (ii) participate in any discussions, conversations,
negotiations and other communications regarding, or furnish to any other
Person any information with respect to, or otherwise cooperate in any way,
assist or participate in, facilitate or encourage any effort or attempt by any
other Person to seek to do any of the foregoing. Seller, the Company and its
Subsidiaries immediately shall cease and cause to be terminated, and shall
cause the Company and its Subsidiaries to cease and terminate, all existing
discussions, conversations, negotiations and other communications with any
Persons conducted heretofore with respect to any of the foregoing.

 

6.11 _Payoff Letters_. On or prior to the third Business Day prior to the
Closing Date, the Company shall deliver to Buyer copies of all Payoff Letters
for all unpaid Company Debt and Selling Expenses.

6.12 _Management Agreement_. At or prior to the Closing, but after the
payment of any Selling Expenses as contemplated by Section 2.3(a)(iii) of this
Agreement, Seller and the Company shall take such action as may be necessary
to cause the Management Agreement to be 

 



33  terminated without any penalty, cost or consideration to be payable or
incurred by the Company and all payments thereunder to be made prior to the
Closing and for the parties thereto to release and waive any and all claims
that any of them may have against the Company under the Management Agreement
as of the Closing; provided that such termination and release shall be
effected in a manner so that all indemnification obligations of the Company
thereunder shall survive such termination and release.

6.13 _Resignation of Directors_. At the Closing, Seller shall deliver to
Buyer evidence of the resignation of all directors of the Company (other than
those designated by Buyer to the Company prior to the Closing) at the Closing.

6.14 _Litigation Support_. So long as any Party actively is contesting or
defending against any Action in connection with (a) the Acquisition or (b) any
fact, situation, circumstance, status, condition, activity, practice, plan,
occurrence, event, incident, action, failure to act, or transaction
attributable to the period prior to the Closing Date involving any the Company
or any of its Subsidiaries, each other Party will cooperate with such Party
and such Partys counsel in the contest or defense, make available their
personnel, and provide such testimony and access to their books and records as
shall be reasonably necessary in connection with the contest or defense, at
the sole cost and expense of the contesting or defending Party (unless the
contesting or defending Party is entitled to indemnification therefor under
Section 9.2); _provided_ , that the defending Party shall not be
responsible for any of such costs or expenses incurred by any other Party
that are not out-of-pocket costs or expenses paid or payable to a third party.

6.15 _Non-Solicitation_. Seller hereby agrees that, during the period
beginning on, and ending [***] after, the Closing Date, Seller shall not:

 

(a) solicit for employment or employ any Person who is an employee of,
consultant to or agent of any of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries as of
the Closing Date (other than Persons terminated without cause by such entity)
or induce or attempt to induce or encourage others to induce or attempt to
induce any such Person to (i) terminate such Persons employment with such
employer (in the case of an employee) or cease providing its services to such
entity (in the case of a consultant or sales or other commercial
representative), provided, that nothing herein shall prevent (x) general
solicitations through advertising or similar means which are not specifically
directed at employees of, consultants to or agents of any of the Company or
its Subsidiaries or (y) solicitations through any means of any employee,
consultant or agent of any of the Company or its Subsidiaries whose
relationship with such entity is terminated by such entity, nor prohibit the
hiring of any such Person responding to such solicitations; or

 

(b) divert, solicit or attempt to divert or solicit, or assist or encourage
any Person in diverting, soliciting or attempting to divert any customer or
supplier prior to the Closing Date of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
to or for any competitor or supplier of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
in connection with or with respect to the provision of any products
or services competitive with those products and services provided by the
Company of any of it Subsidiaries prior to the Closing Date.

 



 

***Confidential Treatment Requested

34 6.16 _Employees_.

 

(a) The Buyer agrees that it or its Subsidiaries shall, for a period of at
least twelve months following the Closing Date, provide to the employees of
the Company and its Subsidiaries as of the Closing Date who are not covered by
a collective bargaining agreement and who remain employed by the Company or
its Subsidiary during such period (collectively, the "Continuing Employees"),
benefits (excluding base salary, wages, bonuses and incentives) that are
reasonably comparable in the aggregate to the benefits provided by the Company
and its Subsidiaries to such Continuing Employees immediately prior to
the date hereof. All Continuing Employees who are eligible for the 2011
Company approved bonus plan as of the date hereof and as of the Closing Date
shall continue to be eligible thereunder after the Closing Date in accordance
with the terms of such plan; provided, that, nothing herein shall be deemed
to be a guaranty of continued employment during such period. The Buyer agrees
that it or its Subsidiaries shall offer employment after the Closing to the
people listed on Section 6.16 of the Disclosure Schedule (such employees, the
"China Employees") and will initially provide such employees with (i) a rate
of base salary or wages and bonus opportunity that is not less favorable than
the rate of base salary or wages and bonus opportunity paid by to such
employees immediately prior to the date hereof as set forth in Section 6.16 of
the Disclosure Schedule, (ii) with other benefits that are substantially
similar in the aggregate to the benefits provided to such employees
immediately prior to the date hereof as set forth in Section 6.16 of the
Disclosure Schedule. Seller agrees that until the earlier of (a) six (6)
months from the Closing Date and (b) the date each China Employee is no
longer employed by the Buyer or any of its Subsidiaries, it will provide to
each China Employee office space and office and technology related services
(other than any benefits related services) to the extent such services relate
to such China Employees employment with Buyer and were provided by Seller
(or a Person affiliated with Seller) in connection with such China Employees
employment with Seller (or a Person affiliated with Seller) prior to the
Closing, without charge or cost to the Company or its Subsidiaries.

(b) With respect to the 401(k) plan, health benefits program and vacation
policy maintained by the Buyer or any of its Subsidiaries following the
Closing and in which any of the Continuing Employees participate (the "Buyer
Plans"), for purposes of determining eligibility to participate and vesting
purposes (but not for accrual of benefits other than determining the level of
vacation pay accrual), service with the Company and its Subsidiaries shall be
treated as service with the Buyer and or its Subsidiaries, except to the
extent such service credit would result in any duplication of benefits. Each
applicable Buyer Plan shall waive eligibility waiting periods, evidence of
insurability requirements and pre-existing condition limitations. To the
extent applicable in the plan year that contains the Effective Time, the
Continuing Employees shall be given credit under the applicable Buyer Plan for
amounts paid prior to the Effective Time during the calendar year in which the
Effective Time occurs under a corresponding benefit plan for purposes of
applying deductibles, co-payments and out of pocket maximums, as though such
amounts had been paid in accordance with the terms and conditions of the Buyer
Plan.

IX. _SURVIVAL OF REPRESENTATIONS, WARRANTIES AND COVENANTS; INDEMNIFICATION_

9.1 _Survival of Representations and Warranties and Covenants_. The
representations and warranties (i) of the Company contained in Sections [***]
and of the Seller in [***] (collectively, the "Special Representations") and
(ii) of the Buyer contained in Sections [***] shall [***]. Each
representation and warranty of the Company contained in Section [***] shall
survive the Closing and continue in full force and effect until the date which
is [***] from the Closing Date. Each representation and warranty of
the Company contained in Section [***] shall survive the Closing and continue
in full force and effect until the date which is [***] from the Closing Date.
All other representations and warranties of the Company, Seller and Buyer
contained in this Agreement will survive the Closing and will continue in
full force and effect until the expiration of [***] after the Closing Date (in
each instance, the end date of the applicable survival period is herein
referred to as the "Survival Expiration Date"). No claim for indemnification
relating to the representations or warranties contained in this Agreement may
be asserted pursuant to this Agreement unless such claim is asserted in

Seller, the Company, or the Buyer set forth herein shall survive until [***].
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the covenants set forth in Section [***] shall

9.2 _Indemnification_. (a) Subject to Sections 6.7 and 9.4, Buyer and its
officers, directors, partners, employees, agents and affiliates, including,
after the Closing, the Company and its Subsidiaries (collectively, the "Buyer

extent of a claim after the Closing, solely from the Escrow Funds during the
period such funds are held by the Escrow Agent), for any and all Damages to
the extent attributable to (i) any breach of any representation or warranty
the Company or Seller have made in this Agreement as of the date hereof or as
of the Closing (all of which for purposes of this Section 9.2 shall be deemed
to have been made as of the Closing Date) or the certificate referred to in
Section 7.2(c) or (ii) any breach, violation or default by the Company or
Seller of any covenant, agreement or obligation in this Agreement
(collectively, the claims made under clauses (i) and (ii), "Buyer Claims").

"Seller Indemnified Parties") harmless for any and all Damages to the extent

***Confidential Treatment Requested

38  been made as of the Closing Date) or the certificate referred to in Section

agreement or obligation of Buyer in this Agreement (collectively, the claims
made under clauses (i) and (ii), "Sellers Claims").

9.3  _Indemnification Claim Procedures_. If any Action is commenced or
threatened that may give rise to a claim for indemnification (an
"Indemnification Claim") by any Person entitled to indemnification under this
Agreement (each, an "Indemnified Party"), then such Indemnified Party will
promptly give written notice to the Indemnitor and provide the Indemnitor with
all relevant information respecting such matter that is in the possession of
the Indemnified Party. Failure to notify the Indemnitor will not relieve the
Indemnitor of any liability that it may have to the Indemnified Party, except
to the extent the defense of such Action is materially and irrevocably
prejudiced by the Indemnified Partys failure to give such notice. An
Indemnitor may elect, by notice to the Indemnified Party within thirty (30)
days to assume and thereafter conduct the defense of any Action subject to any
such Indemnification Claim with counsel of the Indemnitors choice and to
settle or compromise any such Action, and each Indemnified Party shall
cooperate in all respects with the conduct of such defense by the Indemnitor
and/or the settlement of such Action by the Indemnitor; provided, however,
that the Indemnitor will not approve of the entry of any judgment or order or
enter into any settlement or compromise with respect to the Indemnification
Claim without the Indemnified Partys prior written approval (which must not
be unreasonably withheld or delayed). If the Indemnified Party gives an
Indemnitor notice of an Indemnification Claim and the Indemnitor does not,
within thirty (30) days after such notice is given, give notice to the
Indemnified Party of its election to assume the defense of the Action or
Actions subject to such Indemnification Claim and thereafter promptly assumes
such defense, then the Indemnified Party may conduct the defense of such
Action; _provided_ , _however_ , that the Indemnified Party will not agree to
the entry of any judgment or enter into any settlement or compromise with
respect to the Action or Actions subject to any such Indemnification Claim
without the prior written consent of the Indemnitor (which consent shall not
be unreasonably withheld). A claim for any matter not involving a third party
may be asserted by written notice to the Party from whom indemnification is
sought; _provided_ , _however_ , that any Indemnification Claim in respect of
any actual or alleged breach of representation or warranty contained herein
must be asserted prior to the Survival Expiration Date.

9.4 _Limitations on Indemnification Liability_. Any claims an Indemnified
Party makes under this Section IX will be limited as follows:

 

(a) _Indemnification Cap_. Notwithstanding any provision hereof to the
contrary, after the Closing, the aggregate amount of Damages for which Buyer
Indemnified Parties shall be entitled to indemnification pursuant to this
Section IX for breaches of representations and warranties will not exceed
[***]; _provided_ , _however_ , that such limitation shall not apply
with respect to (i) any Damages resulting from or relating to any breach
[***] and (ii) any action [***]. Notwithstanding the limitations set forth in
the preceding sentences, in no event (other than fraud) shall the Sellers
aggregate Liability for indemnification pursuant to this Agreement [***].
[***].

(b) _Claims Basket_. Notwithstanding any provision hereof to the contrary,
(i) Buyer Indemnified Parties shall not be entitled to indemnification
pursuant to this Section IX

 



 

***Confidential Treatment Requested

39  with respect to any individual claim for indemnification for breach of a
representation or warranty, other than for breach of the warranty in clause
(i) of Section 3.8(d) prior to the delivery of the Real Property Title
Policies, unless and until the amount of Damages incurred by Buyer Indemnified
Parties that are the subject of such individual claim exceeds [***] (the "Per
Claim Basket") and (ii) Buyer Indemnified Parties shall only be entitled to
indemnification pursuant to this Section IX for breach of a representation or
warranty, other than for breach of the warranty in clause (i) of Section
3.8(d) prior to the delivery of the Real Property Title Policies, to the
extent the aggregate amount of all Damages incurred by Buyer Indemnified
Parties for which Buyer Indemnified Parties are entitled to indemnification
pursuant to this Section IX exceeds [***] (the "Basket Amount"), and Buyer
Indemnified Parties shall only be entitled to indemnification for such Damages
to the extent such Damages exceed the Basket Amount. Notwithstanding any
provision hereof to the contrary, (i) the Seller Indemnified Parties shall
not be entitled to indemnification pursuant to this Section IX with respect to
any claim for indemnification unless and until the amount of Damages incurred
by the Seller Indemnified Parties that are the subject of such claim
exceeds the Per Claim Basket and (ii) the Seller Indemnified Parties shall
only be entitled to indemnification pursuant to this Section IX to the extent
the aggregate amount of all Damages incurred by the Seller Indemnified Parties
for which the Seller Indemnified Parties are entitled to indemnification
pursuant to this Section IX exceeds the Basket Amount, and the Seller
Indemnified Parties shall only be entitled to indemnification for such Damages
to the extent such Damages exceed the Basket Amount.

(c) _Damages Net of Insurance Proceeds, Tax Benefits and Other Third-Party
Recoveries_. Notwithstanding any provision in this Agreement to the contrary,
all Damages for which any Indemnified Party would otherwise be entitled to
indemnification under this Section IX shall be reduced by the amount of
insurance proceeds, Tax benefits and other third-party recoveries (other than
with respect to indemnification payments) which any Indemnified Party receives
or obtains in respect of any Damages incurred by such Indemnified Party. In
the event any Indemnified Party is entitled to any insurance proceeds, Tax
benefits or any third-party recoveries (other than with respect to
indemnification payments) in respect of any Damages for which such Indemnified
Party is entitled to indemnification pursuant to this Section IX, such
Indemnified Party shall use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain,
receive or realize such proceeds, benefits, payments or recoveries. In the
event that any such insurance proceeds, Tax benefits or other third-party
recoveries are realized by an Indemnified Party subsequent to receipt by such
Indemnified Party of any indemnification payment hereunder in respect of the
claims to which such insurance proceeds, Tax benefits other third-party
recoveries relate, appropriate refunds shall be made promptly by the relevant
Indemnified Parties of all or the relevant portion of such indemnification
payment.

(d) _Assignment of Claims_. If any Indemnified Party receives any
indemnification payment pursuant to this Section IX, at the election of the
Indemnitor, such Indemnified Party shall assign to the Indemnitor all of its
claims for recovery against third Persons as to such Damages, whether by the
Companys insurance coverage, contribution claims, subrogation or otherwise.

9.5  _Expenses_. Notwithstanding anything set forth herein to the contrary,
if the indemnifying party controlling the defense of an Indemnification Claim
is the Seller, the Sellers costs and expenses incurred in connection with
such defense shall be reimbursed to the Seller

 



 

***Confidential Treatment Requested

40  from the Escrow Funds. In such event, the Seller shall notify the Buyer and
the Escrow Agent in writing of the Sellerss costs and expenses incurred in
connection with such defense (an "Expense Notice"). The failure by the Seller
to promptly deliver an Expense Notice shall not adversely affect the Sellers
right to reimbursement from the Escrow Amount, except to the extent the Buyer
is materially prejudiced thereby. If, by 5:00 p.m. New York time on the 30th
day following receipt by the Buyer of an Expense Notice, the Seller and the
Escrow Agent have not received from the Buyer notice in writing that the Buyer
objects to the claim set forth in the Expense Notice (an "Expense Dispute"),
the Escrow Agent shall pay to the Seller from the Escrow Funds the amount set
forth in the Expense Notice. If the Buyer timely delivers an Expense Dispute
to the Seller, the Buyer on the one hand and the Seller shall promptly meet
and use their reasonable efforts to settle the dispute as to whether and to
what extent the Seller is entitled to reimbursement from the Escrow Funds.
Following an agreement by the Buyer and the Seller regarding reimbursement
from the Escrow Funds, the Buyer and the Seller shall deliver a joint written
instruction to the Escrow Agent, setting forth such agreement and instructing
the Escrow Agent to release funds from the Escrow Funds in the agreed amount.

 

9.6 _Mitigation of Damages_. An Indemnified Party shall use its reasonable
best efforts to mitigate any Damages for which it is entitled to
indemnification pursuant to this Section IX.

9.7 _Indemnification Adjustment_. All amounts paid with respect to
Indemnification Claims under this Agreement shall be treated by the parties
hereto for all Tax purposes as adjustments to the Purchase Price.

9.8 _Sole and Exclusive Remedy_. In the absence of fraud and except for
equitable relief, after the Closing, the indemnification provisions contained
in this Section IX will constitute the sole and exclusive recourse and remedy
of the parties for monetary damages with respect to any breach of any of the
representations, warranties or covenants contained in this Agreement with
respect to any Buyer Claims or Sellers Claims, other than with respect to
fraud on the part of any Seller. The provisions of this Section IX will not
however restrict the right of any party to seek specific performance or other
equitable remedies in connections with any breach of any of the covenants
contained in this Agreement.

9.9 _Release of Escrow_. The Escrow Amount shall be held and invested by the
Escrow Agent in accordance with the terms of the Escrow Agreement, which
shall specify that (i) the Escrow Funds in excess of [***] shall be released
to the Seller on the fifth Business Day following the [***]; provided,
however, that if any claim by an Indemnified Party pursuant to Section IX
shall have been properly asserted by any Buyer Indemnified Party pursuant to
this Agreement on or prior to the Survival Expiration Date and remains pending
on the Survival Expiration Date (any such claim, a "Pending Claim"), (a) the
Escrow Funds released to the Seller on such date shall be the amount of Escrow
Funds in excess of [***] then held by the Escrow Agent, _minus_ the aggregate
amount of such Pending Claim and (b) any Escrow Funds in excess of [***]
following the Survival Expiration Date in respect of any such Pending Claim
shall be released to the Seller upon resolution or (if applicable)
satisfaction of such Pending Claim and (ii) the remaining Escrow Funds, other
than any funds held in escrow related to any Pending Claims, shall be released
to the Seller on the fifth Business Day following [***]; provided, however,
that if any claim by an Indemnified Party pursuant to Section IX shall have

 



 

***Confidential Treatment Requested

41  been properly asserted by any Buyer Indemnified Party pursuant to this
Agreement on or prior to the second anniversary of the Closing Date and
remains pending on such date, (a) the Escrow Funds released to the Seller on
the fifth Business Day following [***] shall be the remaining Escrow Funds
_minus_ the aggregate amount of such claim and (b) any Escrow Funds following
such date in respect of any such claim shall be released to the Seller upon
resolution or (if applicable) satisfaction of such claim. Each of Buyer and
the Seller shall from time to time submit joint written instructions to the
Escrow Agent instructing the Escrow Agent to distribute the Escrow Funds in
accordance with this Section 9.9 and the Escrow Agreement.

9.10 _Tax Indemnification_. Notwithstanding any provision herein to the
contrary, Seller shall indemnify the Company, its Subsidiaries and Buyer and
hold them harmless from and against (without duplication), any loss, claim,
liability, expense, or other damage attributable to (i) all Taxes (or the
non-payment thereof) of Company and its Subsidiaries for all taxable periods
ending on or before the Closing Date and the portion thereof through the end
of the Closing Date for any taxable period that includes but does not end on
the Closing Date (the "Pre-Closing Tax Period"), and (ii) any and all Taxes
of any person (other than the Company and its Subsidiaries) imposed on the
Company and its Subsidiaries as a transferee or successor, by contract
or pursuant to law, rule, or regulation, which Taxes relate to an event or
transaction occurring before the Closing. In the case of any taxable period
that includes (but does not end on) the Closing Date (a "Straddle Period"),
the amount of any Taxes based on or measured by income, receipts, or payroll
of the Company and its Subsidiaries for the Pre-Closing Tax Period shall be
determined based on an interim closing of the books as of the close of
business on the Closing Date (and for such purpose, the taxable period of any
partnership or other pass-through entity in which the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries holds a beneficial interest shall be deemed to terminate at such
time) and the amount of other Taxes of Company and its Subsidiaries for a
Straddle Period that relates to the Pre-Closing Period shall be deemed to be
the amount of such Tax for the entire taxable period multiplied by a fraction
the numerator of which is the number of days in the taxable period ending on
the Closing Date and the denominator of which is the number of days in such
Straddle Period. [***].

and present, direct and indirect equityholders, officers, managers, directors,
predecessors, successors, assigns, and employees (other than those Persons who

Releasees") of and from any and all charges, complaints, claims, liabilities,
obligations, promises, agreements, controversies, damages, actions, causes of
action, suits, rights, demands, costs, losses, debts and expenses (including
attorneys fees and costs actually incurred) of any kind or nature whatsoever
that relate to or arise out of (i) the direct or indirect ownership of the
Company by the Seller and the American Securities Funds, (ii) any management
or similar services provided by the Selling Entity Releasees in connection
with such ownership and (iii) any other actions taken by the Selling Entity
Releasees in connection with the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, in law,

known, from the beginning of the world to the Closing Date, and (b)
acknowledges and agrees that such Releasing Party is expressly waiving all
such claims, even those the Releasing Party may not know or suspect to exist,
which if known may have materially affected the decision to provide this
Release, and (c) waives any rights of such Releasing Party under applicable
Law that provide to the contrary, other than (i) with respect to any act of

Persons acting on their behalf to not) assert any claim or cause of action
against the Seller, or hold Seller liable with respect thereto, except with

sentence.

 

10.16 _Specific Performance_. The parties hereto hereby acknowledge and agree

adequate remedy. Accordingly, each of the parties hereto hereby consents to
the granting of equitable relief (including specific performance and
injunctive relief) by any court of competent jurisdiction to enforce and
partys obligations hereunder. The parties further agree to waive any
requirement for the securing or posting of any bond in connection with the

to perform this Agreement.

director of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries in any matter involving
this Agreement or any other agreements or transactions contemplated hereby
(including any litigation, arbitration, mediation or other proceeding), by
Kaye Scholer LLP. Buyer and the Company further agree that, as to all
communications between Kaye Scholer LLP, the Company and Seller that relate in
any way to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, the

Seller and may be controlled by Seller, and shall not pass to or be claimed
or controlled by the Company; provided that the Seller shall not waive such
attorney/client privilege other than to the extent appropriate in connection
with the enforcement or defense of their respective rights or obligations
existing under this Agreement and the other agreements referred to herein.
