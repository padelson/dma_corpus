copies of: (i)&nbsp;the executed commitment letter, dated as of September&nbsp;8, 2010 between Buyer,
Deutsche Bank AG New York Branch, Deutsche Bank AG Cayman Islands Branch, Deutsche Bank Securities
Inc., UBS Securities LLC and UBS Loan Finance LLC, related term sheets and any &#147;market flex&#148;
provisions applicable to such commitments (the &#147;<I>Debt Financing Commitment</I>&#148;), pursuant to which,
upon the terms and subject solely to the conditions set forth therein, Deutsche Bank AG New York
Branch, Deutsche Bank AG Cayman Islands Branch, Deutsche Bank Securities Inc., UBS Securities LLC
and UBS Loan Finance LLC have agreed to lend the amounts set forth therein for the purpose of
funding the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (the &#147;<I>Debt Financing</I>&#148;); and (ii)&nbsp;the
executed equity commitment letter, dated as of September&nbsp;8, 2010 among Buyer and the Guarantors
(the &#147;<I>Equity Financing Commitment</I>&#148; and together with the Debt Financing Commitment, the &#147;<I>Financing
Commitments</I>&#148;), pursuant to which, upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth therein,
the Guarantors have committed to invest the cash amount set forth in its Equity Financing
Commitment (the &#147;<I>Equity Financing</I>&#148; and together with the Debt Financing, the &#147;<I>Financing</I>&#148;). None of
the Financing Commitments has been amended or modified prior to the date of this Agreement, and, as
of the date hereof, the respective commitments contained in the Financing Commitments have not been
withdrawn, terminated or rescinded in any respect. As of the date hereof, there are no other
agreements, side letters or arrangements to which Buyer, Intermediate or Merger Sub is a party
relating to any of the Financing Commitments that could adversely affect the availability or the
amount of the gross proceeds of the Financing. As of the date hereof, the Financing Commitments
are in full force and effect and constitute the legal, valid and binding obligations of each of
Buyer (with respect to the Equity Financing Commitment), Buyer (with respect to the Debt Financing
Commitment) and, to the knowledge of Buyer, the other parties thereto. Other than as expressly set
forth in the Financing Commitments, there are no conditions precedent related to the funding of the
full net proceeds of the Financing (including any &#147;market flex&#148; provisions) under any agreement
relating to the Financing to which Buyer or any of its Affiliates is a party that would, or would
reasonably be expected to, (a)&nbsp;impair the validity of the Financing Commitments, (b)&nbsp;reduce the
aggregate amount of the Financing or (c)&nbsp;materially delay or prevent the Closing. Assuming
performance by the Company of its obligations under this Agreement and the accuracy of the
representations and warranties of the Company set forth in this Agreement, upon receipt of the
proceeds contemplated by the Financing Commitments, together with the available cash and cash
equivalents of the Company and its Subsidiaries, Buyer, Intermediate and Merger Sub will have
access at the Effective Time to sufficient cash funds to pay all amounts contemplated by this
Agreement to be paid by them, to redeem or refinance any Funded Indebtedness that is to be redeemed
or refinanced at Closing, and to perform their respective obligations hereunder. As of the date
hereof, no event has occurred which would constitute a breach or default (or with notice or lapse
of time or both would constitute a default) by Buyer under the Financing Commitments, or, to the
knowledge of Buyer, the other parties to the Financing Commitments. Buyer has fully paid or caused
to be fully paid all commitment fees or other fees required to be paid on or prior to the date
hereof pursuant to the Financing Commitments.

be paid to the Company by wire transfer of same day funds an amount equal to $70,000,000 (the
&#147;<I>Buyer Termination Fee</I>&#148;). Solely for purposes of establishing the basis for the amount thereof,
and without in any way increasing the amount of the Buyer Termination Fee or expanding the
circumstances in which the Buyer Termination Fee is to be paid, it is agreed that the Buyer
Termination Fee is liquidated damages, and not a penalty, and the payment of the Buyer Termination
Fee in the circumstances specified herein is supported by due and sufficient consideration
(including the fact that the holders of Stock immediately prior to the Effective Time would not be
entitled to receive the Per Share Merger Consideration at the Effective Time). While, subject to
Section&nbsp;8.5(d), the Company may pursue both a grant of specific performance under Section&nbsp;9.9(b)
and the payment of the Buyer Termination Fee under this Section&nbsp;8.5, under no circumstances shall
the Company be permitted or entitled to receive both a grant of specific performance and monetary
damages in connection with this Agreement or any termination of this Agreement, including all or
any portion of the Buyer Termination Fee.
