W I T N E S S E T H:

 

WHEREAS, it is proposed that Acquisition Sub shall commence a tender offer

being hereinafter referred to as the "Offer Price"), all upon the terms and
subject to the conditions set forth herein;

WHEREAS, it is also proposed that, as soon as practicable following the
consummation of the Offer, Acquisition Sub will merge with and into the
Company (the "Merger") in accordance with the General Corporation Law of the
State of Delaware (the "DGCL") and each share of Company Common Stock that is
not tendered and accepted pursuant to the Offer (other than Cancelled Company
Shares and Dissenting Company Shares) will thereupon be cancelled and
converted into the right to receive cash in an amount equal to the Offer
Price, and the Company will survive the Merger as a wholly-owned subsidiary of
Parent, all upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth herein;

 

WHEREAS, the Merger will be governed by Section 251(h) of the DGCL and will be

collectively, the "Support Agreements") pursuant to which the signatories
thereto are agreeing to tender their Company Common Stock into the Offer and
to take (and refrain from taking) certain other actions in connection with

writing and who shall have properly and validly perfected their
statutory rights of appraisal in respect of such shares of Company Common
Stock in accordance with Section 262 of the DGCL (collectively, "Dissenting

converted into, and to have become exchangeable for, as of the Effective Time,
the right to receive the Merger Consideration, without interest thereon, upon
surrender of the certificate or certificates that formerly evidenced
such shares of Company Common Stock in the manner provided in _Section_ __ _
2.8_.

(ii) The Company shall give Parent (A) prompt notice of any demands for
appraisal received by the Company, withdrawals of such demands, and any other
instruments served pursuant to Delaware Law and received by the Company in
respect of Dissenting Company Shares and (B) the opportunity to direct all
negotiations and proceedings with respect to demands for appraisal under
Delaware Law in respect of Dissenting Company Shares. The Company shall not,
except with the prior written consent of Parent, voluntarily make any payment
with respect to any demands for appraisal, or settle or offer to settle any
such demands for payment, in respect of Dissenting Company Shares.

 



-11- (d) _Company Options_. Effective as of the Effective Time, each Company
Option (or portion thereof) that is outstanding as of immediately prior to the
Effective Time, whether vested or unvested, shall, without any action on the
part of Parent, Acquisition Sub, the Company or the holder thereof, be
cancelled and converted into and shall become a right to receive an amount in
cash, without interest, equal to (i) the amount of the Merger Consideration (
_less_ the exercise price per share attributable to such Company Option)
_multiplied_   _by_ (ii) the total number of shares of Company Common Stock
issuable upon exercise in full of such Company Option (the "Option
Consideration"). Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement,
with respect to Company Options for which the exercise price per share
attributable to such Company Options is equal to or greater than the Merger
Consideration, those Company Options shall be cancelled on the Effective Time
without any cash payment being made in respect thereof. The payments of the
Option Consideration will be subject to all required withholdings and the
amount of cash each holder of Company Options is entitled to receive pursuant
to the terms and conditions of this _Section 2.7(d)_ for the Company Options
held by such holder shall be rounded to the nearest cent on a Company Option
grant by Company Option grant basis and, (x) with respect to the Vested

Company RSUs outstanding as of immediately prior to the Effective Time,
whether vested or unvested, shall, without any action on the part of Parent,
Acquisition Sub, the Company or the holder thereof, be cancelled and converted
into and will become a right to receive an amount in cash, without interest,
equal to (i) the amount of the Merger Consideration _multiplied_ _by_ (ii) the
total number of outstanding Company RSUs subject to such award (the "Company
RSU Consideration"). The payments of the Company RSU Consideration will be
subject to all required withholdings and the amount of cash each holder of
Company RSUs is entitled to receive pursuant to the terms and conditions of
this _Section 2.7(e)_ for the Company RSUs held by such holder shall be
rounded to the nearest cent on a Company RSU award by Company RSU award basis
and, (x) with respect to the Vested Company RSUs, shall be payable in
accordance with _Section 2.7(g)(ii)_ and (y) with respect to the Unvested
Company Options, shall be payable in accordance with _Section 2.7(g)(iii)_.

(f) _Employee Stock Purchase Plan_. Effective as of no later than
immediately preceding the Effective Time, the Company shall have terminated
the Company ESPP. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company Board (or, if
appropriate, any committee administering the Companys ESPP) shall adopt such
resolutions with respect to the Company ESPP to provide that (i) all
outstanding purchase rights under the Company ESPP shall automatically be
exercised, in accordance with the terms of the Company ESPP, prior to the
Effective Time (the "Final Purchase"), (ii) the Company ESPP shall terminate
with such purchase and no further purchase rights are granted under the
Company ESPP thereafter, (iii) each individual participating in the Company
ESPP shall not be permitted (x) to increase the amount of his or her rate of

not participating in the Company ESPP as of the date of this Agreement may
commence participation in the Company ESPP following the date of this
Agreement. All shares of Company Common Stock purchased in the Final Purchase
shall be cancelled at the Effective Time and converted into the right to
receive the Merger Consideration in accordance with the terms and conditions
of this Agreement.

(g) _Implementation_.

 

(i) _Company Board Approval_. The Company Board or a committee thereof
shall pass resolutions to effect the transactions contemplated by _Sections_
_2.7(d)_ , _2.7(e)_ , _2.7(f)_ and _2.7(g)_ under the Company Stock Plans,
Company ESPP, all Company Option agreements, all Company RSU agreements, and
any other plan or arrangement of the Company.

 



-12- (ii) _Payment for Vested Company Options and Vested Company RSUs_. At or
prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall, to the extent such payments cannot
be satisfied with cash resources held by the Company and its Subsidiaries at
the Effective Time, deposit (or cause to be deposited) with the Company, by
wire transfer of immediately available funds, the aggregate of (A) the
portion of the Option Consideration owed to all holders of Vested Company
Options and (B) the portion of the Company RSU Consideration owed to all
holders of Vested Company RSUs. No later than the second Company payroll date
following the Effective Time (such date, the "Payroll Date"), the applicable
holders of Vested Company Options and Vested Company RSUs shall receive a
payment from the Company or the Surviving Corporation, through its payroll
system or payroll provider (with respect to Employee Options and RSUs) or
through its accounts payable system (with respect to Non-Employee Options
and RSUs), of all amounts required to be paid to such holders in respect of
such Vested Company Options or Vested Company RSUs that are cancelled and
converted pursuant to _Section_ _s_ __ _ 2.7(d)_ or _2.7(e)_ , as
applicable. The Surviving Corporation shall issue a check for amounts payable
in respect of Non-Employee Options and RSUs to such holder, which check shall
be sent by overnight courier to such holder promptly following the Payroll
Date (but in no event more than three Business Days thereafter).

(iii) _Payment for Unvested Company Options and Unvested Company RSUs_.
The Option Consideration owed to holders Unvested Company Options and the
payout of cash pursuant to _Section 2.7(d)_ for Unvested Company Options, and
the Company RSU Consideration owed to holders of Unvested Company RSUs and
the payout of cash pursuant to _Section 2.7(e)_ , in each case only to the
extent that such Unvested Company Option or Unvested Company RSU is
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time, shall be subject to the
same restrictions and vesting arrangements (including the continued employment
or services of the holder) that were applicable to such Unvested Company
Options and Unvested Company RSUs, as applicable, immediately prior to or at
the Effective Time. The Option Consideration or Company RSU Consideration
otherwise owed pursuant to _Section 2.7(d)_ and _Section 2.7(e)_ for Unvested
Company Options and Unvested Company RSUs, respectively, in each case only to
the extent outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (collectively,
the "Unvested Cash"), shall not automatically be payable by Parent or the
Surviving Corporation at the Effective Time, and shall instead become payable
by Parent or the Surviving Corporation no later than the second payroll date
(each such date, a "Unvested Payroll Date") following the date that such
Unvested Company Options or Unvested Company RSUs, as applicable, would have
become vested under the vesting schedule in place for such Company Options or
Company RSUs immediately prior to or at the Effective Time (subject to the
restrictions and other terms of such vesting schedule, including continued
employment of the holder of such Unvested Company Options or Unvested Company
RSUs). Notwithstanding the foregoing, if any Continuing Employee is terminated
by Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any Affiliate of Parent, prior to the
one year anniversary of the Effective Time and for any reason other than
Cause, such holder of Unvested Company Options or Unvested Company RSUs shall
be entitled to receive, payable on the second payroll date following such
termination, the greater of the Unvested Cash attributable to such Unvested
Company Option or Unvested Company RSU (A) had such Unvested Company Option or
Unvested Company RSU vested until the one (1) year anniversary of the
Effective Time and (B) had the vesting accelerated pursuant to
existing acceleration provisions with respect to such Unvested Company Option
or Unvested Company RSU disclosed on _Section 3.6(b)(ii)_ of the Company
Disclosure Letter. All payments of the Unvested Cash will be subject to all
required withholdings and shall be paid without interest and shall be paid by
Parent or the Surviving Corporation in accordance with substantially the same
procedures as the payment of Vested Company Options and Vested Company RSUs
set forth in _Section 2.7(g)(ii)_. No Unvested Cash, or right thereto, may be
pledged, encumbered, sold, assigned or transferred (including any transfer by
operation of law), by any Person, other than Parent, or be taken or

 



-13-  reached by any legal or equitable process in satisfaction of any liability
of such Person, prior to the distribution to such Person of such Unvested Cash
in accordance with this Agreement. Parent, the Company and the Surviving
Corporation intend that the payments of the Unvested Cash shall be deemed an
assumption of the Unvested Company Options and the Unvested Company RSUs for
purposes of Subsection 14(c) of the Companys 2011 Equity Incentive Plan, as
amended.

2.8 _Exchange of Certificates_.

 

(a) _Payment Agent_. Prior to the Acceptance Time, Parent shall, at its
sole cost and expense, select a bank or trust company reasonably acceptable
to the Company to act as the payment agent for the Merger (the "Payment
Agent").

 

(b) _Exchange Fund_. At the Closing, Parent shall deposit (or cause to be
deposited) with the Payment Agent, for payment to the holders of shares of
Company Common Stock pursuant to the provisions of this _Article_ __ _ II_,
an amount of cash equal to the aggregate consideration to which holders of
Company Common Stock become entitled under this _Article_ __ _ II_. Until
disbursed in accordance with the terms and conditions of this Agreement, such
funds shall be invested by the Payment Agent, as directed by Parent or the
Surviving Corporation, in obligations of or guaranteed by the United States
of America or obligations of an agency of the United States of America which
are backed by the full faith and credit of the United States of America (such
cash amount being referred to herein as the "Exchange Fund"). Any interest
and other income resulting from such investments shall be paid to Parent. To
the extent that there are any losses with respect to any investments of the
Exchange Fund, or the Exchange Fund diminishes for any reason below the level
required for the Payment Agent to promptly pay the cash amounts contemplated
by this _Article_ __ _ II_, Parent shall, or shall cause the Surviving
Corporation to, promptly replace or restore the cash in the Exchange Fund so
as to ensure that the Exchange Fund is at all times maintained at a level
sufficient for the Payment Agent to make such payments contemplated by this
_Article_ __ _ II_.

 

(c) _Payment Procedures_. Promptly following the Effective Time, Parent
and the Surviving Corporation shall cause the Payment Agent to mail to each
holder of record (as of immediately prior to the Effective Time) of (i) a
certificate or certificates (the "Certificates") which immediately prior to
the Effective Time represented outstanding shares of Company Common Stock and
(ii) book-entry security entitlements to or other uncertificated shares of
Company Common Stock (the "Uncertificated Shares"), in each case, whose shares
were converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration pursuant to
_Section_ __ _ 2.7_ (A) a letter of transmittal in customary form (which
shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to
the Certificates shall pass, only upon delivery of the Certificates to the
Payment Agent), and/or (B) instructions for use in effecting the surrender of
the Certificates and Uncertificated Shares in exchange for the Merger
Consideration payable in respect thereof pursuant to the provisions of this
_Article_ __ _ II_. Upon surrender of Certificates for cancellation to the
Payment Agent or to such other agent or agents as may be appointed by Parent,
together with such letter of transmittal, duly completed and validly executed
in accordance with the instructions thereto, the holders of such Certificates
shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor an amount in cash equal to
the product obtained by multiplying (x) the aggregate number of shares of
Company Common Stock represented by such Certificate that were converted into
the right to receive the Merger Consideration pursuant to _Section_ __ _
2.7_, by (y) the Merger Consideration (less any applicable withholding taxes
payable in respect thereof), and the Certificates so surrendered shall
forthwith be cancelled. Upon receipt of an "agents message" by the Payment
Agent (or such other evidence, if any, of transfer as the Payment Agent may
reasonably request) in the case of a book-entry transfer of Uncertificated
Shares, the holders of such Uncertificated Shares shall be entitled to receive
in exchange therefor an amount in cash equal to the product obtained
by multiplying (x) the aggregate number of shares of Company Common Stock
represented by such holders transferred Uncertificated Shares that were
converted into the right to

 



-14-  receive the Merger Consideration pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 2.7_, by (y)
the Merger Consideration (less any applicable withholding taxes payable in
respect thereof), and the transferred Uncertificated Shares so surrendered
shall forthwith be cancelled. The Payment Agent shall accept such Certificates
and transferred Uncertificated Shares upon compliance with such reasonable
terms and conditions as the Payment Agent may impose to effect an orderly
exchange thereof in accordance with normal exchange practices. No interest
shall be paid or accrued for the benefit of holders of the Certificates and
Uncertificated Shares on the Merger Consideration payable upon the surrender
of such Certificates and Uncertificated Shares pursuant to this _Section_ __ _
2.8_. Until so surrendered, outstanding Certificates and Uncertificated Shares
shall be deemed from and after the Effective Time, to evidence only the right
to receive the Merger Consideration, without interest thereon, payable in
respect thereof pursuant to the provisions of this _Article_ __ _ II_.

 

(d) _Transfers of Ownership_. In the event that a transfer of ownership of
shares of Company Common Stock is not registered in the stock transfer books
or ledger of the Company, or if the Merger Consideration is to be paid in a
name other than that in which the Certificates or Uncertificated Shares
surrendered in exchange therefor are registered in the stock transfer books
or ledger of the Company, the Merger Consideration may be paid to a Person
other than the Person in whose name the Certificate or Uncertificated Share so
surrendered is registered in the stock transfer books or ledger of the
Company only if such Certificate or Uncertificated Shares is properly
endorsed and otherwise in proper form for surrender and transfer and the
Person requesting such payment has paid to Parent (or any agent designated by
Parent) any transfer taxes required by reason of the payment of the Merger
Consideration to a Person other than the registered holder of such Certificate
or Uncertificated Shares, or established to the satisfaction of Parent (or any
agent designated by Parent) that such transfer taxes have been paid or are
otherwise not payable.

(e) _Required Withholding_. Each of the Payment Agent,
Parent, Acquisition Sub and the Surviving Corporation shall be entitled to
deduct and withhold from any cash amounts payable pursuant to this Agreement
such amounts as are required to be deducted or withheld therefrom under
applicable Laws. To the extent that such amounts are so deducted, withheld
and remitted to the applicable Governmental Authority or other Person in
accordance with applicable Law, such amounts shall be treated for all purposes
under this Agreement as having been paid to the Person to whom such amounts
would otherwise have been paid.

(f) _No Liability_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in
this Agreement, none of the Payment Agent, Parent, the Surviving Corporation
nor any other party hereto shall be liable to a holder of shares of Company
Common Stock for any amount properly paid to a public official pursuant to
any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar Law.

(g) _Distribution of Exchange Fund to Parent_. Any portion of the
Exchange Fund that remains undistributed to the holders of the Certificates or
Uncertificated Shares on the date that is twelve (12) months after the
Effective Time shall be delivered to Parent upon demand, and any holders of
shares of Company Common Stock that were issued and outstanding immediately
prior to the Merger who have not theretofore surrendered their Certificates or
Uncertificated Shares representing such shares of Company Common Stock
for exchange pursuant to the provisions of this _Section_ __ _ 2.8_ shall
thereafter look for payment of the Merger Consideration payable in respect of
the shares of Company Common Stock represented by such Certificates
or Uncertificated Shares solely to Parent and the Surviving Corporation, as
general creditors thereof, for any claim to the applicable Merger
Consideration to which such holders may be entitled pursuant to the provisions
of this  _Article_ __ _ II_.

2.9 _No Further Ownership Rights in Company Common Stock_. From and after
the Effective Time, all shares of Company Common Stock shall no longer be
outstanding and shall automatically be

 



-15-  cancelled, retired and cease to exist, and each holder of a Certificate or
Uncertificated Shares theretofore representing any shares of Company Common
Stock shall cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except the right
to receive the Merger Consideration payable therefor upon the surrender
thereof in accordance with the provisions of _Section_ __ _ 2.8_. The Merger
Consideration paid in accordance with the terms of this _Article_ __ _ II_
shall be deemed to have been paid in full satisfaction of all rights
pertaining to such shares of the Company Common Stock. From and after the
Effective Time, there shall be no further registration of transfers on the
records of the Surviving Corporation of shares of Company Common Stock that
were issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time, other
than transfers to reflect, in accordance with customary settlement
procedures, trades effected prior to the Effective Time. If, after the
Effective Time, Certificates or Uncertificated Shares are presented to the
Surviving Corporation for any reason, they shall be cancelled and exchanged as
provided in this  _Article_ __ _ II_.

2.10 _Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates_. In the event that any
Certificates shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, the Payment Agent
shall issue in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificates, upon
the making of an affidavit of that fact by the holder thereof, the Merger
Consideration payable in respect thereof pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 2.7_;
_provided_ that Parent or the Payment Agent may, in its discretion and as
condition to the payment of such Merger Consideration, require the owners of
such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificates to deliver a bond in such
customary amount as it may direct as indemnity against any claim that may be
made against Parent, the Surviving Corporation or the Payment Agent with
respect to the Certificates alleged to have been lost, stolen or destroyed.

2.11 _Necessary Further Action_ _s_. If, at any time after the Effective
Time, any further action is necessary or desirable to carry out the purposes
of this Agreement and to vest the Surviving Corporation with full right, title
and possession to all assets, property, rights, privileges, powers and
franchises of the Company and Acquisition Sub, the directors and officers of
the Company and Acquisition Sub shall take all such lawful and necessary
action.

 

ARTICLE III

 

REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF THE COMPANY

 

Except (i) as disclosed in the letter delivered by the Company to Parent on

and any other disclosures contained or referenced therein of information,
factors or risks that are predictive, cautionary or forward-looking in
nature), the Company hereby represents and warrants to Parent and Acquisition
Sub as follows:

3.1 _Organization; Good Standing_. The Company is a corporation duly
incorporated, validly existing and in good standing under Delaware Law, and
has the requisite corporate power and authority to conduct its business as it
is presently being conducted and to own, lease or operate its properties
and assets. The Company is duly qualified to do business and is in good
standing in each jurisdiction where the character of its properties owned or
leased or the nature of its activities make such qualification necessary (to
the extent the "good standing" concept is applicable in the case of any
jurisdiction outside the United States), except where the failure to be so
qualified or in good standing would not have, individually or in the
aggregate, a Company Material Adverse Effect. The Company is not in violation
of its certificate of incorporation or bylaws.

3.2 _Corporate Power; Enforceability_. The Company has the requisite
corporate power and authority to execute and deliver this Agreement, to
perform its covenants and obligations hereunder and,

contemplated hereby. The execution and delivery by the Company of this
Agreement, the performance by the Company of its covenants and obligations
hereunder and the consummation by the Company of the transactions contemplated
hereby have been duly authorized by all necessary corporate action on the
part of the Company, and no additional corporate proceedings on the part of
the Company are necessary to authorize the execution and delivery by the
Company of this Agreement, the performance by the Company of its covenants
and obligations hereunder or the consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby, assuming the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
are consummated in accordance with Section 251(h) of the DGCL. This Agreement
has been duly executed and delivered by the Company and, assuming the due
authorization, execution and delivery by Parent and Acquisition Sub,
constitutes a legal, valid and binding obligation of the Company, enforceable
against the Company in accordance with its terms, except that such
enforceability (a) may be limited by applicable bankruptcy, insolvency,
reorganization, moratorium and other similar Laws affecting or relating to
creditors rights generally, and (b) is subject to general principles of
equity (the "Enforceability Limitations").

3.3 _Requisite Stockholder _ _Approval_. The affirmative vote of the
holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of Company Common Stock (the
"Requisite Stockholder Approval") is the only vote of the holders of any class
or series of Company Capital Stock that, absent Section 251(h) of the DGCL,
would have been necessary under applicable Law and the Companys certificate
of incorporation and bylaws to adopt this Agreement and consummate the Merger.

 

3.4 _Non-Contravention_. The execution and delivery by the Company
of this Agreement, the performance by the Company of its covenants and
obligations hereunder and the consummation by the Company of the transactions
contemplated hereby do not and will not (a) violate or conflict with any
provision of the certificate of incorporation or bylaws of the Company, (b)
subject to obtaining such Consents set forth in _Section_ __ _ 3.4_ of the
Company Disclosure Letter, violate, conflict with, or result in the breach of
or constitute a default (or an event which with notice or lapse of time or
both would become a default) under, or result in the termination of, or
accelerate the performance required by, or result in a right of termination or
acceleration under, any Material Contract, (c) assuming the Consents referred
to in _Section_ __ _ 3.5_ are obtained or made and, in the case of the
consummation of the Merger, subject to obtaining the Requisite Stockholder
Approval, violate or conflict with any Law or Order applicable to the Company
or any of its Subsidiaries or by which any of their properties or assets are
bound, or (d) result in the creation of any Lien (other than Permitted Liens)
upon any of the properties or assets of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries, except in the case of each of clauses (b), (c) and (d) above,
for such violations, conflicts, defaults, terminations, accelerations or Liens
which would not reasonably be expected to (i) be material to the Company and
its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole or (ii) prevent or materially delay beyond
the Termination Date the consummation of the Offer or the Merger.

 

3.5 _Required Governmental Approvals_. No consent, approval, Order or
authorization of, filing or registration with, or notification to (any of the
foregoing being referred to herein as a "Consent"), any Governmental Authority

with the execution and delivery by the Company of this Agreement, the
performance by the Company of its covenants and obligations hereunder and the
consummation by the Company of the transactions contemplated hereby, except

Secretary of State of the State of Delaware and such filings with Governmental
Authorities to satisfy the applicable Laws of states in which the Company and
its Subsidiaries are qualified to do business, (b) such filings and approvals
as may be required by any federal or state securities Laws, including
compliance with any applicable requirements of the Exchange Act, (c) Consents
required under, and compliance with any other applicable requirements of the
HSR Act and any applicable foreign Antitrust Laws, and (d) such other
Consents, the failure of which to obtain would

 



-17-  not be reasonably be expected to (i) be material to the Company and its
Subsidiaries, taken as a whole or (ii) prevent or materially delay beyond the
Termination Date the consummation of the Offer or the Merger.

determines in good faith (after consultation with outside legal counsel) that
the failure to take such action would reasonably be expected to be
inconsistent with its fiduciary duties.

Proposal Notice (or Proposal Amendment Notice) continues to be a Superior
Proposal; or

Company Board Recommendation Change if and only if: (A) the Company Board
and/or any authorized committee thereof shall have determined in good faith
(after consultation with outside legal counsel) that the failure to make a

constitute a Company Board Recommendation Change for purposes of this
Agreement); (C) if requested by Parent, the Company shall have made its
Representatives available to discuss with Parents Representatives any
proposed modifications to the terms and conditions of this Agreement during
the period beginning at 5:00 p.m. Pacific Time on the day of delivery by the

thereof shall have determined in good faith, after considering the terms of
such offer by Parent, that the failure to make a Company Board Recommendation
Change in light of such Intervening Event would still reasonably be expected
to be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties.

(b) Nothing in this Agreement shall prohibit the Company Board and/or any
authorized committee thereof from (i) taking and disclosing to the Company
Stockholders a position contemplated by Rule 14e-2(a) under the Exchange Act
or complying with the provisions of Rule 14d-9 promulgated under the Exchange
Act, and (ii) making any disclosure to the Company Stockholders that the
Company Board and/or any authorized committee thereof determines in good
faith (after consultation with its outside legal counsel) that the failure to
make such disclosure would reasonably be expected to be inconsistent with its
fiduciary duties; _provided_ that, in either such case, any such statement(s)
or disclosures made by the Company Board and/or any authorized committee
thereof will be subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement,
including the provisions of _Article_ __ _ VII_.

 

6.4 _Public Statements and Disclosure_. Neither the Company, on the one
hand, nor Parent and Acquisition Sub, on the other hand, shall issue any
public release or make any public announcement concerning this Agreement or
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement without the prior written
consent of the other (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed), except as such release or announcement may be
required by applicable Law or the rules or regulations of any applicable
securities exchange or regulatory or Governmental Authority to which the
relevant party is

  



-44-  subject or submits, wherever situated, in which case the party required to
make the release or announcement shall use its reasonable best efforts to
allow the other party or parties hereto reasonable time to comment on such
release or announcement in advance of such issuance (it being understood that
the final form and content of any such release or announcement, as well as the
timing of any such release or announcement, shall be at the final discretion
of the disclosing party); _provided_ , _however_ , that the restrictions set
forth in this _Section_ __ _ 6.4_ shall not apply to any release or
announcement made or proposed to be made by the Company pursuant to _Section
6.3(a)_ or with respect to an Acquisition Proposal or a Company Board
Recommendation Change.

 

6.5 _Anti-Takeover Laws_. In the event that any state anti-takeover or
other similar Law is or becomes applicable to this Agreement or any of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, the Company, Parent and
Acquisition Sub shall use their respective reasonable best efforts to ensure
that the transactions contemplated by this Agreement may be consummated as
promptly as practicable on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth
in this Agreement and otherwise to minimize the effect of such Law on this
Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby.

 

6.6 _Access_. At all times during the period commencing with the execution
and delivery of this Agreement and continuing until the earlier to occur of
the termination of this Agreement pursuant to _Article_ __ _ VII_ and the
Effective Time, the Company shall afford Parent and its financial advisors,
business consultants, legal counsel, accountants and other agents and
representatives reasonable access during normal business hours, upon
reasonable notice, to the properties, books and records and personnel of the
Company; _provided_ , _however_ , that the Company may restrict or otherwise
prohibit access to any documents or information to the extent that (i) any
applicable Law requires the Company to restrict or otherwise prohibit access
to such documents or information or (ii) access to such documents or
information would give rise to a material risk of waiving any attorney-client
privilege, work product doctrine or other applicable privilege applicable to
such documents or information; and _provided_ _further_ , _however_ , that
no information or knowledge obtained by Parent in any investigation conducted
pursuant to the access contemplated by this _Section_ __ _ 6.6_ shall affect
or be deemed to modify any representation or warranty of the Company set
forth in this Agreement or otherwise impair the rights and remedies available
to Parent and Acquisition Sub hereunder. In the event that the Company does
not provide access or information in reliance on the preceding sentence, it
shall use its reasonable best efforts to communicate the applicable
information to Parent in a way that would not violate the applicable Law,
Contract or obligation or to waive such a privilege. Any investigation
conducted pursuant to the access contemplated by this  _Section_ __ _ 6.6_
shall be conducted in a manner that does not unreasonably interfere with the
conduct of the business of the Company and its Subsidiaries or create a risk
of damage or destruction to any property or assets of the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries. Any access to the properties of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries shall be subject to the terms and conditions of any applicable
Lease and the Companys reasonable security measures and
insurance requirements and shall not include the right to perform Phase 1 or
Phase 2 environmental assessments or other invasive testing. The terms and
conditions of the Confidentiality Agreement shall apply to any information
obtained by Parent or any of its financial advisors, business consultants,
legal counsel, accountants and other agents and representatives in connection
with any investigation conducted pursuant to the access contemplated by this
_Section_ __ _ 6.6_. Nothing in this _Section_ __ _ 6.6_ or elsewhere in
this Agreement shall be construed to require the Company, any of its
Subsidiaries or any Representatives of any of the foregoing to prepare any
reports, analyses, appraisals, opinions or other information.

6.7 _Section_ __ _ 16(b) Exemption_. The Company shall take all
actions reasonably necessary to cause the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement and any other dispositions of equity securities of the Company
(including derivative securities) in connection with the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement by each individual who is a director or
officer of the Company subject to the reporting requirements of Section 16(a)
of the Exchange Act to be exempt under Rule 16b-3 promulgated under the
Exchange Act.

 



-45- 6.8 _Directors_ __ _and Officers_ __ _ Indemnification and Insurance_.

(a) The Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries shall (and Parent shall
cause the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries to) honor and fulfill in
all respects the obligations of the Company and its Subsidiaries under any and
all (i) indemnification agreements that are in effect as of the date hereof
between the Company or any of its Subsidiaries and any of their respective
current or former directors and officers (the "Indemnified Persons") and (ii)
indemnification, expense advancement and exculpation provisions in
any certificate of incorporate or bylaws or comparable organizational
document of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries in effect on the date of
this Agreement. In addition, during the period commencing at the Effective
Time and ending on the sixth (6th) anniversary of the Effective Time, the
Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries shall (and Parent shall cause the
Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries to) cause the certificates of
incorporation and bylaws (and other similar organizational documents) of the
Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries to contain provisions with respect
to indemnification, exculpation and the advancement of expenses that are at
least as favorable as the indemnification, exculpation and advancement of
expenses provisions contained in the certificates of incorporation and bylaws
(or other similar organizational documents) of the Company and its
Subsidiaries as of the date hereof, and during such six-year period, such
provisions shall not be repealed, amended or otherwise modified in any manner
except as required by applicable Law.

 

(b) During the period commencing at the Effective Time and ending on the
sixth (6th) anniversary of the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation
shall (and Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to) maintain in effect
the Companys current directors and officers liability insurance ("DandO
Insurance") in respect of acts or omissions occurring at or prior to the
Effective Time, covering each person covered by the DandO Insurance, on terms
with respect to the coverage and amounts that are equivalent to those of the
DandO Insurance; _provided_ ,  _however_ , that in satisfying its obligations
under this _Section_ __ _ 6.8(b)_, Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall
not be obligated to pay annual premiums in excess of three hundred percent
(300%) of the amount paid by the Company for coverage for its last full
fiscal year (such three hundred percent (300%) amount, the "Maximum Annual
Premium") (which premiums the Company represents and warrants to be as set
forth in  _Section_ __ _ 6.8(b)_ of the Company Disclosure Letter);
_provided_ , _however_ , that, if the annual premiums of such insurance
coverage exceed such amount, Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall be
obligated to obtain a policy with the greatest coverage available for a cost
not exceeding the Maximum Annual Premium. Prior to the Effective Time,
notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement, the
Company may purchase a six-year "tail" prepaid policy on the DandO Insurance. In
the event that the Company elects to purchase such a "tail" policy prior to
the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall (and Parent shall cause
the Surviving Corporation to) maintain such "tail" policy in full force and
effect and continue to honor their respective obligations thereunder, in lieu
of all other obligations of Parent and the Surviving Corporation under the
first sentence of this _Section_ __ _ 6.8(b)_ for so long as such "tail"
policy shall be maintained in full force and effect.

 

(c) If Parent or the Surviving Corporation or any of its successors or
assigns shall (i) consolidate with or merge into any other Person and shall
not be the continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation
or merger, or (ii) transfer all or substantially all of its properties and
assets to any Person, then, and in each such case, proper provisions shall be
made so that the successors and assigns of the Surviving Corporation shall
assume all of the obligations of Parent and the Surviving Corporation set
forth in this _Section_ __ _ 6.8_.

 



-46- (d) The obligations set forth in this  _Section_ __ _ 6.8_ shall not be
terminated, amended or otherwise modified in any manner that adversely affects
any Indemnified Person (or any other person who is a beneficiary under the DandO
Insurance or the "tail" policy referred to in _Section_ __ _ 6.8(b)_ (and
their heirs and representatives)) without the prior written consent of such
affected Indemnified Person or other person who is a beneficiary under the DandO
Insurance or the "tail" policy referred to in _Section_ __ _ 6.8(b)_ (and
their heirs and representatives). Each of the Indemnified Persons or other
persons who are beneficiaries under the DandO Insurance or the "tail"
policy referred to in _Section_ __ _ 6.8(b)_ (and their heirs and
representatives) are intended to be third party beneficiaries of this
_Section_ __ _ 6.8_, with full rights of enforcement as if a party thereto.
The rights of the Indemnified Persons (and other persons who are
beneficiaries under the DandO Insurance or the "tail" policy referred to in
_Section_ __ _ 6.8(b)_ (and their heirs and representatives)) under this 
_Section_ __ _ 6.8_ shall be in addition to, and not in substitution for, any
other rights that such persons may have under the certificates of
incorporation, bylaws or other equivalent organizational documents, any and
all indemnification agreements of or entered into by the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries, or applicable Law (whether at law or in equity).

 

(e) The obligations and liability of Parent, the Surviving Corporation and
their respective Subsidiaries under this  _Section_ __ _ 6.8_ shall be joint
and several.

(f) Nothing in this Agreement is intended to, shall be construed to or
shall release, waive or impair any rights to directors and officers
insurance claims under any policy that is or has been in existence with
respect to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries for any of their respective
directors, officers or other employees, it being understood and agreed that
the indemnification provided for in this _Section_ __ _ 6.8_ is not prior to
or in substitution for any such claims under such policies.

 

6.9 _Employee Matters_.

 

(a) Unless Parent provides written notice to the Company that such 401(k)
plan(s) shall not be terminated no later than ten (10) Business Days prior to
the Acceptance Time, the Company shall terminate any and all 401(k) plans
maintained by the Company or any ERISA Affiliates, as well as such other
benefit plans as Parent may designate in writing no later than ten (10)
Business Days prior to the Acceptance Time, in each case effective as of the
day immediately preceding the date the Company becomes a member of the same
Controlled Group of Corporations (as defined in Section 414(b) of the Code)
as Parent (the "401(k) Termination Date"). The Company shall provide Parent
evidence that such plans have been terminated pursuant to resolutions of the
Company Board or the board of directors of its Subsidiaries, as applicable.
If the 401(k) plan(s) described in this section have been terminated as of the
401(k) Termination Date, Parent shall permit Continuing Employees to roll over
their account balances (including loan notes) to a 401(k) plan of Parent or
an Affiliate.

(b) During the period commencing at the Effective Time and ending one (1)
year following the Effective Time, Parent shall cause the Surviving
Corporation or one of its Subsidiaries or Affiliates to provide each
Continuing Employee with (a) a base salary (or hourly wage rate, as the case
may be) no less favorable than the base salary (or hourly wage rate) in
effect with respect to such Continuing Employee immediately prior to the
Effective Time (which base salary (or hourly wage rate) may be increased in
the sole discretion of Parent in order to reflect any reduction
in automobile-related benefits or cell phone reimbursements as in effect
immediately prior to the Effective Time); and (b) employee benefits (other
than defined benefit pension benefits, severance benefits and equity-based
benefits) of the Surviving Corporation or any of its Subsidiaries or
Affiliates on a basis no less favorable in the aggregate than those provided
to similarly situated employees of Parent (or any applicable Subsidiary or
Affiliate). Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation or one of its
Subsidiaries or Affiliates to provide each Continuing Employee with fiscal
2017 bonus and/or commission opportunities that, in all cases, are no less
than favorable than the fiscal 2017 bonus and/or commission opportunities in
effect with respect to such Continuing Employee immediately prior to the
Effective Time.

 



-47- (c) To the extent that a benefit plan is made available to any
Continuing Employee at or after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation
and its Subsidiaries and Affiliates shall (and Parent shall cause the
Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries and Affiliates to) make
commercially reasonable efforts to cause to be granted to such Continuing
Employee credit for all service with the Company and its Subsidiaries and any
predecessor employer prior to the Effective Time for purposes of eligibility
to participate, vesting and entitlement to benefits where length of service
is relevant (including for purposes of vacation, sick time or paid time off
accrual and severance pay entitlement); _provided_ , _however_ , that such
service shall not be credited to the extent that it would result in
duplication of coverage or benefits. In addition, and without limiting the
generality of the foregoing, the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries
and Affiliates shall (and Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation and its
Subsidiaries and Affiliates to) make commercially reasonable efforts to cause
the following to occur: (i) each Continuing Employee shall be immediately
eligible to participate, without any waiting period, in any and all employee
benefit plans sponsored by the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries and
Affiliates (other than the Company Plans) (such plans, collectively, the "New
Plans") to the extent that coverage pursuant to any such New Plan replaces
coverage pursuant to a comparable Company Plan in which such Continuing
Employee participates immediately before the Effective Time and/or immediately
before the Effective Time (such plans, collectively, the "Old Plans"); (ii)
for purposes of each New Plan providing medical, dental, pharmaceutical,
vision or disability benefits to any Continuing Employee, all waiting periods,
pre-existing condition exclusions, evidence of insurability requirements and
actively-at-work or similar requirements of such New Plan will be waived for
such Continuing Employee and his or her covered dependents, and any eligible
expenses incurred by such Continuing Employee and his or her covered
dependents during the portion of the plan year of the Old Plan ending on the
date that such Continuing Employees participation in the corresponding New
Plan begins to be given full credit pursuant to such New Plan for purposes of
satisfying all deductible, coinsurance and maximum out-of-pocket requirements
applicable to such Continuing Employee and his or her covered dependents for
the applicable plan year as if such amounts had been paid in accordance with
such New Plan; and (iii) credit the accounts of such Continuing Employees
pursuant to any New Plan that is a flexible spending plan with any unused
balance in the account of such Continuing Employee. Any vacation or paid time
off accrued but unused by a Continuing Employee as of immediately prior to the
Effective Time shall be credited to such Continuing Employee following the
Effective Time. For purposes hereof, "Company Plans" shall mean the Employee
Plans and any other employee benefit plans or other compensation or severance
arrangements, excluding equity-based compensation and individual
employment agreements of the Company or the Surviving Corporation.

(d) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement,
no provision of this Agreement shall be deemed to (i) guarantee employment for
any period of time for, or preclude the ability of Parent, the Surviving
Corporation or their Subsidiaries to terminate, any Continuing Employee
for any reason, or (ii) subject to the limitations and requirements
specifically set forth in this _Section_ __ _ 6.9_, require Parent, the
Surviving Corporation or any of their Subsidiaries to continue any Company
Plan or prevent the amendment, modification or termination thereof after the
Effective Time. No provision of this Agreement shall create any third party
beneficiary rights in any employee of the Company or any Company Subsidiary,
any beneficiary or dependents thereof, or any collective bargaining
representative thereof, with respect to the compensation, terms and conditions
of employment and benefits that may be provided to any employee of the Company
or any of its Subsidiaries by Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any of
their Affiliates or under any benefit plan which any of them may maintain, or
otherwise. No provision of this Agreement shall operate as an amendment to any
benefit plan maintained by the Company or Parent or their
respective Subsidiaries.

 



-48- 6.10 _Rule 14d-10 Matters_. The parties acknowledge that certain payments
have been made or are to be made and certain benefits have been granted or are
to be granted according to employment compensation, severance and other
employee benefit plans of the Company, including the Employee Plans
(collectively, the "Arrangements"), to certain Company Stockholders and
holders of other Company Securities (collectively, the "Covered
Securityholders"). The Compensation Committee of the Company Board (the
"Company Compensation Committee") (A) at a meeting to be held prior to the
Acceptance Time, will duly adopt resolutions approving as an "employment
compensation, severance or other employee benefit arrangement" within the
meaning of Rule 14d-10(d)(1) under the Exchange Act (an "Employment
Compensation Arrangement") (1) each Arrangement presented to the Company
Compensation Committee on or prior to the date hereof, (2) the treatment of
the Company Options and Company RSUs, as applicable, in accordance with the
terms set forth in this Agreement, and (3) the terms of _Section_ __ _ 6.8_
and _Section_ __ _ 6.9_, and (B) will take all other actions necessary to
satisfy the requirements of the non-exclusive safe harbor under Rule
14d-10(d)(2) under the Exchange Act with respect to the foregoing
arrangements. Each member of the Company Compensation Committee is an
"independent director" in accordance with the requirements of Rule
14d-10(d)(2) under the Exchange Act.

(a) At all times during the period commencing with the execution and
delivery of this Agreement and continuing until the earlier to occur of the
termination of this Agreement pursuant to _Article_ __ _ VII_ and the
Effective Time, the Company shall give prompt notice to Parent and Acquisition
Sub upon becoming aware that any representation or warranty made by it in
this Agreement has become untrue or inaccurate in any material respect, or of
any failure of the Company to comply with or satisfy in any material respect
any covenant, condition or agreement to be complied with or satisfied by it
under this Agreement, in any such case if and only to the extent that such
untruth or inaccuracy, or such failure, would reasonably be expected to cause
any of the conditions to the obligations of Parent and Acquisition Sub to
consummate the transactions contemplated hereby set forth in _Sections
1.1(b)(iii)(B)_ and _1.1(b)(iii)(C)_ to fail to be satisfied at the then
scheduled expiration of the Offer; _provided_ that no such notification shall
affect or be deemed to modify any representation or warranty of the Company
set forth in this Agreement or the conditions to the obligations of Parent and
Acquisition Sub to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
or the remedies available to the parties hereunder; and _provided_ _further_
that the terms and conditions of the Confidentiality Agreement shall apply to
any information provided to Parent pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 6.12(a)_.

 

(b) At all times during the period commencing with the execution and
delivery of this Agreement and continuing until the earlier to occur of the
termination of this Agreement pursuant to _Article_ __ _ VII_ and the
Effective Time, Parent shall give prompt notice to the Company upon becoming
aware that any representation or warranty made by Parent or Acquisition Sub
in this Agreement has become untrue or inaccurate in any material respect, or
of any failure of Parent or Acquisition Sub to comply with or satisfy in any
material respect any covenant, condition or agreement to be complied with or
satisfied by it under this Agreement, in any such case if and only to the
extent that such untruth or inaccuracy, or such failure, would reasonably be
expected to prevent or materially delay the consummation of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement (including the Offer and the Merger) or the
ability of Parent and Acquisition Sub to fully perform their respective
covenants and obligations under this Agreement; _provided_ , _however_ , that
no such notification shall affect or be deemed to modify any representation
or warranty of Parent or Acquisition Sub set forth in this Agreement or the
conditions

 



-49-  to the obligations of the Company to consummate the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement or the remedies available to the parties
hereunder; and _provided_ _further_ that the terms and conditions of the
Confidentiality Agreement shall apply to any information provided to the
Company pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 6.12(b)_.

 

6.13 _Certain Litigation_. The Company shall promptly advise Parent of any
litigation commenced after the date hereof against the Company or any of its
directors (in their capacity as such) by any Company Stockholders (on their
own behalf or on behalf of the Company) relating to this Agreement or the
transactions contemplated hereby, and shall keep Parent reasonably informed
regarding any such litigation. The Company shall give Parent the opportunity
to consult with the Company regarding the defense or settlement of any such
stockholder litigation and shall consider Parents views with respect to such
stockholder litigation. The Company shall give Parent the opportunity to
participate at Parents expense in in the defense or settlement of any such
litigation against the Company or any of its directors. The Company shall not
settle or make an offer to settle any litigation against the Company or any
director by any stockholder relating to this Agreement, the Offer or the
Merger, without the prior written consent of Parent.

Superior Proposal; (ii) the Company Board and/or any authorized committee

to such Superior Proposal would reasonably be expected to be inconsistent
with its fiduciary duties; (iii) the Company shall have notified Parent in

terms of this Agreement (which is set forth in a definitive written amendment
to this Agreement executed by Parent and Acquisition Sub and delivered to the

effect); or

 

(f) by Parent, in the event that (i) the Company Board or any authorized

terminated by Parent or the Company pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 7.1(b)_
solely as a result of the failure to satisfy the Minimum Condition prior to
such termination; (B) following the execution and delivery of this Agreement
and prior to the termination of this Agreement pursuant to _Section_ __ _
7.1(b)_ solely as a result of the failure to satisfy the Minimum Condition
prior to such termination, a Competing Acquisition Transaction shall have been
publicly announced or shall have become publicly disclosed and, in either
case, shall not have been withdrawn or otherwise abandoned; and (C) within
twelve (12) months following the termination of this Agreement pursuant to
_Section_ __ _ 7.1(b)_ solely as a result of the failure to satisfy the
Minimum Condition prior to such termination, the Competing Acquisition
Transaction referenced in the preceding clause (B) is consummated or a binding
definitive agreement for such Competing Acquisition Transaction shall be
entered into by the Company and the counterparty within such twelve-month
period and such transaction shall subsequently be consummated. For purposes of
the foregoing, a "Competing Acquisition Transaction" shall have the same
meaning as an "Acquisition Transaction" except that all references therein to
"more than twenty percent (20%)" shall be deemed to be references to "a
majority."

 

(ii) In the event that this Agreement is terminated by the Company pursuant
to  _Section_ __ _ 7.1(e)_, the Company shall pay to Parent the Termination
Fee, by wire transfer of immediately available funds to an account or accounts
designated in writing by Parent, as a condition to the effectiveness of
such termination.

 



-52- (iii) In the event that this Agreement is terminated by Parent pursuant to
_Section_ __ _ 7.1(f)_, the Company shall pay to Parent the Termination Fee,
by wire transfer of immediately available funds to an account or accounts
designated in writing by Parent, within two (2) Business Days after demand by
Parent.

(c) _Single Payment Only_. The parties hereto acknowledge and hereby agree
that in no event shall the Company be required to pay the Termination Fee on
more than one occasion, whether or not such termination fee may be payable
under more than one provision of this Agreement at the same or at different
times and the occurrence of different events.

(d) _Liquidated Damages_. Each of the Company, Parent and Acquisition Sub
acknowledges and agrees that (i) the agreements contained in this _Section_
__ _ 7.3_ are an integral part of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, (ii) the Termination Fee is not a penalty, but is liquidated
damages, in a reasonable amount that will compensate Parent in the
circumstances in which such fee is payable for the efforts and resources
expended and opportunities foregone while negotiating this Agreement and in
reliance on this Agreement and on the expectation of the consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby, which amount would otherwise be impossible
to calculate with precision, (iii) subject to clause _(b)_ of _Section_ __ _
7.2_, in the event that Parent shall receive the Termination Fee, none of
Parent, Acquisition Sub, any of their respective Affiliates or any other
Person shall be entitled to bring or maintain any other claim, action or
proceeding against the Company or any of its Affiliates arising out of this
Agreement, any of the transactions contemplated hereby or any matters forming
the basis of the termination of this Agreement triggering the payment of such
Termination Fee, and (iv) without these agreements, neither the Company
nor Parent would have entered into this Agreement; accordingly, if the
Company fails to timely pay any amount due pursuant to this _Section_ __ _
7.3_ and, in order to obtain such payment, Parent commences a suit that
results in a judgment against the non-paying party for the payment of any
amount set forth in this _Section_ __ _ 7.3_, the non-paying shall pay the
other party its costs and expenses in connection with such suit, together
with interest on such amount at the annual rate of five percent (5%) plus the
prime rate as published in _The_ _Wall_ _Street_ _Journal_ in effect on the
date such payment was required to be made through the date such payment was
actually received, or such lesser rate as is the maximum permitted by
applicable Law.

 

7.4 _Amendment_. Subject to applicable Law and subject to the other
provisions of this Agreement, this Agreement may be amended by the parties
hereto at any time by execution of an instrument in writing signed on behalf
of each of Parent, Acquisition Sub and the Company; _provided_ , _however_ ,
that in the event that this Agreement has been adopted by the Company
Stockholders in accordance with Delaware Law, no amendment shall be made to
this Agreement that requires the approval of such Company Stockholders under
Delaware Law without such approval.

 

7.5 _Extension; Waiver_. At any time and from time to time prior to the
Effective Time, any party or parties hereto may, to the extent legally
allowed and except as otherwise set forth herein, (a) extend the time for the
performance of any of the obligations or other acts of the other party or
parties hereto, as applicable, (b) waive any inaccuracies in the
representations and warranties made to such party or parties hereto contained
herein or in any document delivered pursuant hereto and (c) waive compliance
with any of the agreements or conditions for the benefit of such party or
parties hereto contained herein. Any agreement on the part of a party or
parties hereto to any such extension or waiver shall be valid only if set
forth in an instrument in writing signed on behalf of such party or parties,
as applicable. Any delay in exercising any right under this Agreement shall
not constitute a waiver of such right.

rights, interests, or obligations hereunder without the prior written approval
of the other parties; _provided_ that, in connection with any financing
arrangements, Parent and Acquisition Sub may assign all or any portion of
their rights under this Agreement, or delegate all or any portion of their

hereunder. Subject to the preceding sentence, this Agreement shall be binding
upon and shall inure to the benefit of the parties hereto and their respective
successors and permitted assigns.

8.6 _Confidentiality_. Parent, Acquisition Sub and the Company hereby
acknowledge that Parents Affiliate, Aurea Software, Inc., and the Company
have previously executed a Confidentiality Agreement, made as of January 11,
2017 (as amended, the "Confidentiality Agreement"), which will continue in
full force and effect in accordance with its terms. Parent and Acquisition
Sub each hereby acknowledges that it has received, and may continue to
receive, Evaluation Material (as defined in the Confidentiality Agreement) and
agrees to be bound by the provisions of the Confidentiality Agreement (and
the Company shall be entitled to enforce the provisions of the Confidentiality
Agreement against each of them) as though it were a direct party thereto and
Aurea Software, Inc. thereunder.

 

8.7 _Entire Agreement_. This Agreement and the documents and instruments
and other agreements among the parties hereto as contemplated by or referred
to herein, including the Company Disclosure Letter, the Annexes hereto, and
the Confidentiality Agreement, constitute the entire agreement among the
parties with respect to the subject matter hereof and supersede all prior
agreements and understandings, both written and oral, among the parties with
respect to the subject matter hereof; _provided_ , _however_ , the
Confidentiality Agreement shall not be superseded, shall survive
any termination of this Agreement and shall continue in full force and effect
until the earlier to occur of (a) the Effective Time and (b) the date on which
the Confidentiality Agreement expires in accordance with its terms or is
validly terminated by the parties thereto.

 



-56- 8.8 _No Third Party Beneficiaries_. This Agreement is not intended to,
and shall not, confer upon any other Person any rights or remedies hereunder,
except (a) as set forth in or contemplated by the terms and provisions of
_Section_ __ _ 6.8_, (b) from and after the Acceptance Time, the rights of
holders of shares of the Company Common Stock and other Company Securities to

the application thereof, becomes or is declared by a court of competent
jurisdiction to be illegal, void or unenforceable, the remainder of this
Agreement will continue in full force and effect and the application of such
provision to other persons or circumstances will be interpreted so as
reasonably to effect the intent of the parties hereto. The parties further
agree to replace such void or unenforceable provision of this Agreement with a
valid and enforceable provision that will achieve, to the extent possible, the
economic, business and other purposes of such void or unenforceable
provision.

8.10 _Remedies_.

 

(a) Subject to _Sections 7.3(b)_ through _(d)_ , and except as otherwise
provided herein, any and all remedies herein expressly conferred upon a party
will be deemed cumulative with and not exclusive of any other remedy conferred
hereby, or by law or equity upon such party, and the exercise by a party of
any one remedy will not preclude the exercise of any other remedy.

(b) The parties hereto hereby agree that irreparable damage would occur in
the event that any provision of this Agreement were not performed in
accordance with its specific terms or were otherwise breached, and that money
damages or other legal remedies would not be an adequate remedy for any such
damages. Accordingly, the parties hereto acknowledge and hereby agree that in
the event of any breach or threatened breach by the Company, on the one hand,
or Parent or Acquisition Sub, on the other hand, of any of their respective
covenants or obligations set forth in this Agreement, the Company, on the one
hand, and Parent and Acquisition Sub, on the other hand, shall be entitled to
an injunction or injunctions to prevent or restrain breaches or threatened
breaches of this Agreement by the other (as applicable), and to
specifically enforce the terms and provisions of this Agreement to prevent
breaches or threatened breaches of, or to enforce compliance with, the
covenants and obligations of the other under this Agreement and to thereafter
cause the Merger and the transactions contemplated by this Agreement to be
consummated. The Company, on the one hand, and Parent and Acquisition Sub, on
the other hand hereby agree not to raise any objections to the availability of
the equitable remedy of specific performance to prevent or restrain breaches
or threatened breaches of this Agreement by such party (or parties), and to
specifically enforce the terms and provisions of this Agreement to prevent
breaches or threatened breaches of, or to enforce compliance with,
the covenants and obligations of such party (or parties) under this
Agreement. Any party seeking an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches
of this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions of this
Agreement shall not be required to provide any bond or other security in
connection with any such order or injunction. The parties hereto further agree
that (x) by seeking the remedies provided for in this _Section 8.10(b)_ , a
party shall not in any respect waive its right to seek any other form of
relief that may be available to a party under this Agreement (including
monetary damages) in the event that this Agreement has been terminated or in
the event that the remedies provided for in this  _Section 8.10(b)_ are not
available or otherwise are not granted and (y) nothing set forth in this
_Section 8.10(b)_ shall require any party hereto to institute any proceeding

 



-57-  for (or limit any partys right to institute any proceeding for) specific
performance under this _Section 8.10(b)_ prior or as a condition to exercising
any termination right under  _Article_ __ _ VIII_ (and pursuing damages
after such termination), nor shall the commencement of any Legal Proceeding
pursuant to this _Section 8.10(b)_ or anything set forth in this _Section
8.10(b)_ restrict or limit any partys right to terminate this Agreement in
accordance with the terms of _Article_ __ _ VIII_ or pursue any other
remedies under this Agreement that may be available then or thereafter.

 

8.11 _Governing Law_. This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in
accordance with the Laws of the State of Delaware, regardless of the Laws
that might otherwise govern under applicable principles of conflicts of law
thereof.

 

8.12 _Consent to Jurisdiction_. Each of the parties hereto (i) irrevocably
consents to the service of the summons and complaint and any other process in
any action or proceeding relating to the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement for and on behalf of itself or any of its properties or assets, in
accordance with _Section_ __ 8.4 or in such other manner as may be permitted
by applicable Law, and nothing in this Section 8.12 shall affect the right of
any party to serve legal process in any other manner permitted by applicable
Law; (ii) irrevocably and unconditionally consents and submits itself and its
properties and assets in any action or proceeding to the exclusive
jurisdiction of the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware (or, only if
the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware declines to accept or does not
have jurisdiction over a particular matter, any federal or other state court
within the State of Delaware) in the event any dispute or controversy arises
out of this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby, or for
recognition and enforcement of any judgment in respect thereof; (iii) agrees
that it will not attempt to deny or defeat such personal jurisdiction by
motion or other request for leave from any such court; (iv) agrees that
any actions or proceedings arising in connection with this Agreement or the
transactions contemplated hereby shall be brought, tried and determined only
in the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware (or, only if the Court of
Chancery of the State of Delaware declines to accept or does not have
jurisdiction over a particular matter, any federal or other state court within
the State of Delaware); (v) waives any objection that it may now or hereafter
have to the venue of any such action or proceeding in any such court or that
such action or proceeding was brought in an inconvenient court and agrees not
to plead or claim the same; and (vi) agrees that it will not bring any action
relating to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby
in any court other than the aforesaid courts. Each of Parent, Acquisition Sub
and the Company agrees that a final judgment in any action or proceeding in
such courts as provided above shall be conclusive and may be enforced in
other jurisdictions by suit on the judgment or in any other manner provided by
applicable Law.

 

8.13 _WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL_. EACH OF PARENT, ACQUISITION SUB AND THE
COMPANY HEREBY IRREVOCABLY WAIVES ALL RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY ACTION,
PROCEEDING OR COUNTERCLAIM (WHETHER BASED ON CONTRACT, TORT OR OTHERWISE)

ACQUISITION SUB OR THE COMPANY IN THE NEGOTIATION, ADMINISTRATION,
PERFORMANCE AND ENFORCEMENT HEREOF.

8.14 _Company Disclosure Letter Matters_.

 

(a) The information contained in this Agreement and in the Company
Disclosure Letter is disclosed solely for purposes of this Agreement, and no

violation of Law or breach of Contract, or (ii) that such information is
material or that such information is required to be referred to or disclosed
under this Agreement.

 



-58- (b) The parties hereto agree that the disclosure set forth in
any particular section or subsection of the Company Disclosure Letter shall

of) (i) the representations and warranties (or covenants, as applicable) of
the Company that are set forth in the corresponding Section or subsection of
this Agreement, and (ii) any other representations and warranties (or
covenants, as applicable) of the Company that are set forth in this Agreement,
but, in the case of this clause (ii), only if the relevance of that
disclosure as an exception to (or a disclosure for purposes of) such other
representations and warranties (or covenants, as applicable) is reasonably
apparent on the face of such disclosure.

 

8.15 _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed in one or more
counterparts, all of which shall be considered one and the same agreement and
shall become effective when one or more counterparts have been signed by each
of the parties and delivered to the other party, including by email or
