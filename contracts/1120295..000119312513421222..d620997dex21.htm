1.6 _Shareholders  Rights upon Merger_.

 

(a) Upon consummation of the Merger, certificates that immediately prior to
the Effective Time represented outstanding Shares (the " _Certificates_ ")
shall cease to represent any rights with respect thereto, and, subject to
applicable Law and this Agreement, the Certificates shall only represent the
right to receive the applicable portion of the Merger Consideration payable

right to receive the applicable portion, if any, of the Merger Consideration
payable hereunder with respect to such Shares at or after the Effective Time.
Holders of Dissenting Shares shall be entitled only to such rights as are
granted by Chapter 13 of CGCL. If, after the Effective Time, such holder fails

Consideration payable with respect to such Shares hereunder upon surrender of

-5-  each Company Option that is outstanding immediately prior to the Effective
Time, whether or not exercisable or vested, will, by virtue of the Merger and
without the need for any further action on the part of the holder thereof,
cease to be an option to purchase shares of Common Stock and be cancelled in
exchange for the right to receive an amount of cash equal to (x) in the case
of Company Options held by the individuals listed on  _Schedule 1.7(a)-2_ ("
_Senior Management_ "), the product obtained by multiplying (1) (A) the Per
Share Common Closing Amount less the per share exercise price of the Company
Option, plus (B) the Per Share Common Adjustment Amount (if any), plus (C)
the Per Share Common Escrow Amount (if any), by (2) the number of Shares
subject thereto or (y) in the case of the Company Options held by individuals
other than Senior Management (the " _Non-Management Company Options_ "), the
product obtained by multiplying (1) (A) the Per Share Non-Management Option
Holder Closing Amount (as hereinafter defined) less the per share exercise
price of the Company Option, plus (B) the Per Share Common Adjustment Amount
(if any), by (2) the number of Shares subject thereto, in each case as more
fully set forth on _Schedule 1.7(b)_. The " _Per Share Non-Management Option
Holder Closing Amount_ " means the Per Share Common Closing Amount plus the
Per Share Common Escrow Amount. Notwithstanding the foregoing, payment of any
portion of the Escrow Amount and the Adjustment Amount, if any, to the holders
of Company Options shall be made on the same schedule and under the same
terms and conditions as apply to any payment of the Escrow Amount and the
Adjustment Amount, if any, to the Shareholders generally but no later than
five years after the Effective Time in accordance with U.S. Treas. Reg.
Section 1.409A-3(i)(5)(iv)(A) and less applicable Taxes required to be
withheld with respect to such payments; _provided_ , _however_ , that the
payment of any portion of the Escrow Amount with respect to the Company
Options shall be paid by the Escrow Agent to the Company to be distributed to
such holders subject to any applicable Taxes required to be withheld with
respect to such payments. As promptly as practicable following the Closing,
the Company shall pay to each holder of Company Options the portion of the
Initial Merger Consideration to which he or she is entitled pursuant to this
Section 1.7(a), less applicable Taxes required to be withheld with respect to
such payments. Prior to paying such holder of Company Options his or her
respective portion of the Merger Consideration, the Company shall obtain from
each holder of Company Options an Option Cancellation Agreement.

 

(b) _Further Actions_. Subject to, and without limitation of, the foregoing
provisions of this Section 1.7, the Company shall take all actions necessary
or appropriate so that prior to or at the Effective Time, (i) all options,
warrants and other securities convertible into capital stock of the Company
and other rights to purchase or otherwise acquire capital stock of
the Company shall be canceled or terminated or expire by their terms, and
(ii) any plan, program or arrangement providing for the issuance or grant of
any interest in respect of the capital stock of the Company shall be
terminated, provided that any such termination will comply with the
provisions of Code Section 409A, if applicable.

or shall cause to be deposited no later than one Business Day after the
Closing Date, with a payment agent selected by Parent with the Companys prior
approval, which shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed (the " _Payment
Agent_ "), for the benefit of the holders of Shares, cash necessary to pay the
Initial Merger Consideration to such holders of Shares to be paid in
connection with the Merger (such cash being hereinafter referred to as the "
_Payment Fund_ ," it being understood that any and all interest earned on
funds deposited therein pending payment shall be turned over to Parent). The
Payment Agent shall, pursuant to irrevocable instructions, make the payments
provided for in this Section 1.10 and the Payment Fund shall not be used for
any other purpose.

(b) Parent will cause the Payment Agent, within five Business Days after the
Closing Date, to deliver to each holder of record of a Certificate that
immediately prior to the Effective Time represented outstanding Shares at the
address set forth opposite such holders name on _Schedule 1.10(b)_ (as
updated from time to time in writing by the Company) a letter of transmittal
and instructions for use in effecting a surrender of the Certificates in
exchange for its respective portion of the Merger Consideration in the form
attached hereto as _Exhibit E_ (a " _Letter of Transmittal_ "). Upon surrender
of a Certificate for cancellation to the Payment Agent together with the
submission of a duly completed and validly executed Letter of Transmittal to
the Payment Agent, the holder of the Shares to which such Letter of
Transmittal relates shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor cash
(without interest), representing such holders respective portion of the
Merger Consideration calculated in accordance with, and payable when and as
provided in, this Agreement, less applicable Taxes required to be withheld
with respect to such payments. Following the Effective Time and pending
a Shareholders submission of a Letter of Transmittal, each such holder will
be deemed, for all purposes, to hold an irrevocable right to receive that
amount of consideration equal to his, her or its respective portion of the
Merger Consideration into which such holders Shares shall have been so
converted in accordance with this Agreement.

(c) Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company may provide to certain holders
of Shares the Letter of Transmittal and other documentation described above
prior to the Effective Time, and any such holder that surrenders a Certificate
to the Payment Agent together 

 



-9-  with such Letter of Transmittal, duly completed and validly executed in
accordance with the instructions thereto, and such other documents as may be
reasonably required by the Payment Agent, at or prior to Closing shall be
entitled to receive, and the Payment Agent shall pay promptly after the
Effective Time, cash (without interest), representing such holders respective
portion of the Merger Consideration calculated in accordance with, and
payable when and as provided in, this Agreement, less applicable Taxes
required to be withheld with respect to such payments.

 

(d) Parent shall cause the Payment Agent to deliver, no later than five
Business Days after submission of a properly completed and duly executed
Letter of Transmittal by a Shareholder, cash (without interest), representing
such holders respective portion of the Initial Merger Consideration
calculated and payable in accordance with this Agreement.

 

(e) At or after the Effective Time, there shall be no transfers on the
transfer books of the Company of the Shares that were outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective Time.

(f) Any portion of the Payment Fund that remains unclaimed by a holder of
Shares six months after the Effective Time shall be delivered to Parent and
any such holder who has not returned a Letter of Transmittal in accordance
with this Section 1.10 prior to that time shall thereafter look only to Parent
for payment of such holders portion of the Initial Merger Consideration.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, none of Parent,
the Surviving Company, the Representative or any other party hereto shall be
liable to any Person for any amount properly paid to a public official
pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar Law. Any
amounts remaining unclaimed by holders of Shares two years after the Effective
Time (or such earlier date immediately prior to such time when the
amounts would otherwise escheat to or become property of any Governmental
Authority) shall become, to the extent permitted by applicable Law, the
property of Parent free and clear of any claims or interest of any Person
previously entitled thereto.

 

1.11 _Post-Closing Adjustment to Merger Consideration_.

 

(a) " _Net Working Capital_ " means, as of 12:01 a.m., Pacific Standard Time,
on the Closing Date, the excess of the current assets of the Company
(excluding any Cash, Tax receivables and deferred Tax assets of the Company)
over the current liabilities of the Company (excluding any deferred Tax
liabilities, Indebtedness and Company Transaction Expenses and including
any current and long-term deferred revenues), in each case as reflected on
the balance sheet of the Company as of such date. For the avoidance of doubt,
current liabilities will include an accrual for all bonuses required to be
paid under the Companys 2013 employee bonus plan (or otherwise) and an
accrual for commissions and for statutory liabilities related to the Companys
employees. For purposes of this definition, current liabilities shall exclude
Taxes of the Company arising from the 338(h)(10) Election (as defined in
Section 7.7(g)) or the payment of the Gross Up (as defined in Section 7.7(h)).
For purposes of the Closing Balance Sheet and the determination of Net Working
Capital, whether estimated or final, the amount accrued for the contingent
payment liability under the Australian Purchase Agreement (as defined herein)
shall be equal to $900,000.

 



-10- (b) _Pre-Closing Estimates_. At least two Business Days prior to the Closing
Date, the Company or the Representative shall deliver to Parent a statement
setting forth the calculation of an estimate as of the Closing Date of (i) the
Closing Net Working Capital (the " _Estimated Closing Net Working Capital_
"), (ii) the Indebtedness (the " _Estimated Indebtedness_ "), (iii) the Cash
(the " _Estimated Cash_ ") and (iv) the Company Transaction Expenses (such
statement being, the " _Good Faith Statement_ "). The Good Faith Statement
shall be prepared by the Company in good faith, in a reasonable manner and in
accordance with the accounting principles set forth on _Schedule 1.11(c),_
consistently applied, and shall have been approved by the Companys Board of
Directors. Parent shall have reasonable access to copies of the working papers
of the Company prepared or used in connection with the Companys preparation
of the Good Faith Statement. Parent shall have an opportunity to review with
representatives of the Company and object to all or any part of the Good Faith
Statement, such review to be reasonably prompt and any objection to be
reasonable and made in good faith. If the Estimated Closing Net Working
Capital is greater than $6,818,000 (the " _Target Net Working Capital_ "),
then the Initial Merger Consideration payable at the Closing pursuant to
Sections 1.4 and 1.9(b) shall be increased by an amount equal to the amount
by which the Estimated Closing Net Working Capital exceeds the Target Net
Working Capital. If the Estimated Closing Net Working Capital is less than the
Target Net Working Capital, then the Initial Merger Consideration payable at
the Closing pursuant to Sections 1.4 and 1.9(b) shall be reduced by an amount
equal to the amount by which the Target Net Working Capital exceeds the
Estimated Closing Net Working Capital. The Initial Merger Consideration
payable at the Closing pursuant to Sections 1.4 and 1.9(b) shall also be
reduced by an amount equal to the Estimated Indebtedness, if any. The Initial
Merger Consideration payable at the Closing pursuant to Sections 1.4 and
1.9(b) shall be increased by an amount equal to the Estimated Cash, if any.

(c) _Delivery of the Closing Balance Sheet, Closing Statement of Cash and
Closing Statement of Indebtedness_. As soon as reasonably practicable
following the Closing Date, and in any event within 90 calendar days
thereafter, Parent shall deliver to the Representative, (i) a balance sheet of
the Company as of 12:01 a.m., Pacific Standard Time, on the Closing Date (the
" _Closing Balance Sheet_ "), (ii) a calculation of Net Working Capital of the
Company prepared by Parent as of 12:01 a.m., Pacific Standard Time, on the
Closing Date, determined using the Closing Balance Sheet (the " _Closing Net
Working Capital_ "), (iii) a statement reflecting the Indebtedness of the
Company immediately prior to the Closing (the " _Closing Statement of
Indebtedness_ "), (iv) a statement reflecting the Company Transaction
Expenses immediately prior to the Closing (the " _Closing Statement of Company
Transaction Expenses_ ") and (v) a statement reflecting the Cash of the
Company immediately prior to the Closing (the " _Closing Statement of Cash_
") using the methodology set forth on _Schedule 1.11(c)_. The total amount of
Indebtedness on the Closing Statement of Indebtedness shall be the " _Closing
Indebtedness_." The total amount of Cash on the Closing Statement of Cash
shall be the " _Closing Cash_." The total amount of the Company Transaction
Expenses on the Closing Statement of Cash shall be the " _Closing Company
Transaction Expenses_." For purposes of preparing the Closing Balance Sheet
and the calculation of Closing Net Working Capital, Parent shall, or shall
cause the Surviving Company to, take, within a reasonable period of time
following the Closing, a physical count of the inventory of the Surviving
Company. Designees of the Representative may observe the taking of such
physical count. The Closing Balance Sheet shall be prepared in accordance with
United States generally accepted accounting principles (" _GAAP_ ") applied
in a

 



-11-  manner consistent with the accounting principles applied in the preparation
of the Annual Financial Statements (as hereinafter defined) of the Company
and, where applicable, using the methodology described on _Schedule 1.11(c)_.
To the extent there is any inconsistency between the methodology of GAAP
applied in a manner consistent with the accounting principles applied in the
preparation of the Annual Financial Statements and the methodology described
on _Schedule 1.11(c)_ , the methodology described on _Schedule 1.11(c)_ shall
supersede and be the basis on which the Closing Balance Sheet is prepared.

 

(d) _Audit Rights; Agreement upon the Closing Net Working Capital, Closing
Indebtedness, Closing Company Transaction Expenses and Closing Cash_. Upon
delivery of the Closing Balance Sheet, the Closing Statement of Indebtedness,
the Closing Statement of Cash and the Closing Statement of Company Transaction
Expenses, Parent shall provide the Representative and its
accountants reasonable access to the accountants and accounting records of
the Company and shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to provide the
Representative with reasonable access to any and all working papers prepared
by the Company or Parent related to the preparation of the Closing Balance
Sheet, the Closing Statement of Indebtedness, the Closing Statement of Company
Transaction Expenses and the Closing Statement of Cash, and the calculation of
Closing Net Working Capital, Closing Indebtedness, Closing Company
Transaction Expenses and Closing Cash. If the Representative disagrees with
the calculation of the Closing Net Working Capital as not being in accordance
with GAAP consistent with the Audited Financial Statements and/or, as
applicable, _Schedule 1.11(c)_, or the calculation of Closing Indebtedness or
Closing Cash as not being in accordance with the principles set forth on
_Schedule 1.11(c)_ , or, in each case, as having computational errors, the
Representative must notify Parent of such disagreement in writing, setting
forth in reasonable detail the particulars of such disagreement, within 30
days after its receipt of the Closing Balance Sheet and the calculation of
Closing Net Working Capital or the Closing Statement of Indebtedness and the
calculation of Closing Indebtedness or the Closing Statement of Company
Transaction Expenses and the calculation of Closing Company Transaction
Expenses or the Closing Statement of Cash and the calculation of Closing
Cash, as the case may be ("Dispute Notice"). In the event that the
Representative does not provide a Dispute Notice within such 30 day period,
the Representative shall be deemed to have accepted the Closing Balance Sheet
and the calculation of Closing Net Working Capital set forth therein and/or
the Closing Statement of Indebtedness and the calculation of Closing
Indebtedness set forth therein and/or the Closing Statement of Company
Transaction Expenses and the calculation of Closing Company Transaction
Expenses set forth therein and/or the Closing Statement of Cash and the
calculation of Closing Cash set forth therein, each as delivered by Parent,
which shall then be final, binding and conclusive for all purposes hereunder.
In the event a Dispute Notice is timely provided, Parent and the
Representative shall use commercially reasonable efforts for a period of 30
days (or such longer period as they may mutually agree) to resolve any
disagreements with respect to the preparation of the Closing Balance Sheet
and/or the calculation of Closing Net Working Capital and/or the Closing
Statement of Indebtedness and/or the Closing Statement of Company Transaction
Expenses and/or calculation of Closing Indebtedness or the Closing Statement
of Cash and/or calculation of Closing Cash, as the case may be. If, at the end
of such period, they are unable to resolve such disagreements, then Parent and
the Representative shall mutually select an independent accounting firm of
recognized national standing (the " _Auditor_ ") to act as a referee to
resolve any remaining disagreements. The Auditor shall determine as promptly
as practicable, 

 



-12-  but in any event within 30 calendar days after the date on which such
dispute is referred to the Auditor, based solely on the terms of this
Agreement, any remaining disputes. Each of Parent and the Representative (or
their respective designees) shall be permitted to submit a proposed Closing
Balance Sheet, Closing Statement of Indebtedness, Closing Statement of Company
Transaction Expenses or Closing Statement of Cash, as the case may be and
applicable supporting documentation and to make a presentation to the Auditor
in connection with the resolution of any such disagreements, and, without the
mutual agreement of Parent and the Representative, the Auditor shall not rely
on or consider any other documents, materials, presentations or evidence
(other than the plain language of the Agreement) in making its determination.
It is the intent of the Parties that the process set forth in this Section
1.11(d) and the activities of the Auditor in connection herewith are not (and
should not be considered to be or treated as) an arbitration proceeding or
similar arbitral process and that no formal arbitration rules should be
followed (including, in particular, but without limitation, rules with
respect to procedures and discovery). The fees and expenses of the Auditor
incurred in connection with its review and resolution of any disputes shall be
allocated between Parent, on one hand, and the Representative, on the other,
by the Auditor in proportion to the extent either of such Parties did not
prevail in the aggregate on items in dispute on their respective Closing
Balance Sheets, Closing Statements of Indebtedness, Closing Statements of
Company Transaction Expenses or Closing Statements of Cash, as the case may
be; _provided,_ that such fees and expenses shall not include, so long as a
Party complies with the procedures of this Section, the other Partys outside
counsel, accounting or other fees. The determination of the Auditor shall be
final, conclusive and binding on the Parties. The amounts of the Closing Net
Working Capital, Closing Indebtedness, Closing Company Transaction Expenses
and Closing Cash as finally determined in accordance with the terms of this
Section 1.11 shall be referred to as the " _Final Closing Net Working Capital_
", " _Final Closing Indebtedness_ ", " _Final Closing Company
Transaction Expenses_ " and " _Final Closing Cash_ ," respectively. The date
on which the Final Closing Net Working Capital, Final Closing Indebtedness,
Final Closing Company Transaction Expenses and Final Closing Cash are all
finally determined in accordance with this Section 1.11(d) (or the latest
date on which any of such calculation is finally determined) is hereinafter
referred to as, the " _Determination Date_."

 

(e) _Definitions_. The following terms shall have the following meanings:

 

(i) " _Cash Adjustment Amount_ ," which may be positive or negative, means (A)
the Final Closing Cash,  _minus_ (B) the Estimated Cash.

(ii) " _Company Transaction Expenses Adjustment Amount_ ," which may be
positive or negative, means (A) the Final Closing Company Transaction
Expenses, _minus_ (B) the Estimated Company Transaction Expenses, each
expressed as a negative number.

 

(iii) " _Indebtedness Adjustment Amount_ ," which may be positive or negative,
means (A) the Final Closing Indebtedness, _minus_ (B) the Estimated
Indebtedness, each expressed as a negative number.

 



-13- (iv) " _Working Capital Adjustment Amount_ ," which may be positive or
negative, means (A) the Final Closing Net Working Capital, _minus_ (B) the
Estimated Closing Net Working Capital.

For purposes of convenience only, the Parties agree that upon the final
determination of the Indebtedness Adjustment Amount, Company Transaction
Expenses Adjustment Amount, Cash Adjustment Amount and the Working Capital
Adjustment Amount, such amounts shall be aggregated for the purpose of paying
the Adjustment Amount (as defined below) to Parent or the Representative, as
the case may be. The sum of the Indebtedness Adjustment Amount, the Company
Transaction Expenses Adjustment Amount, the Cash Adjustment Amount and the
Working Capital Adjustment Amount shall be the " _Adjustment Amount_ ". For
example, if the Indebtedness Adjustment Amount equals negative $1,000,000
(i.e., such amount is owed to Parent), the Company Transaction
Expenses Adjustment Amount equals negative $1,000,000 (i.e., such amount is
owed to Parent), the Cash Adjustment Amount equals positive $500,000 (i.e.,
such amount is owed to the Securityholders) and the Working Capital Adjustment
Amount equals positive $100,000 (i.e., such amount is owed to the
Securityholders), each as finally determined, then the Adjustment Amount would
be negative $1,400,000, and such amount would be owed to Parent in accordance
with the terms of this Section 1.11.

 

(f) _Positive Adjustment Payment_. If the Adjustment Amount is a positive
number, then, promptly following the Determination Date, and in any event
within five Business Days of the Determination Date, Parent shall deposit (by
wire transfer of immediately available funds) the Adjustment Amount (other
than the portion of the Adjustment Amount allocable to the Dissenting Shares
and the Company Options, which shall be payable to such holders by the
Company subject to any applicable Law or backup or other withholding
requirements) in such bank account(s) as may be designated by the
Representative, for distribution to the Shareholders (other than any
Shareholder who holds Dissenting Shares), without interest.

(g) _Negative Adjustment Payment_. If the Adjustment Amount is a negative
number, then, promptly following the Determination Date, and in any event
within five Business Days of the Determination Date, Parent and the
Representative shall cause the Escrow Agent to pay (by wire transfer
of immediately available funds) to Parent out of the Escrow Amount an amount
equal to the lesser of (A) the Adjustment Amount, together with any interest
earned on that portion of the Escrow Amount equal to the Adjustment Amount, or
(B) the full amount of the Escrow Amount, together with any interest earned
thereon.

For purposes of this Agreement, " _Indebtedness_ " shall mean, without
duplication (i) all outstanding liabilities for borrowed money and debt, (ii)
that portion of obligations with respect to capital leases that is properly
classified as a liability on a balance sheet in conformity with GAAP, (iii)
notes payable and drafts accepted representing extensions of credit whether or

indebtedness for money borrowed by a third party, (v) all amounts drawn under
outstanding letters of credit, (vi) all deferred compensation obligations,
including (A) all payment obligations under any non-qualified deferred
compensation plans and (B) any

retirement liabilities of the Company and its Subsidiaries as required to be
measured under SFAS 87 or SFAS 106 at the transaction date, (vii) all costs,
liabilities and obligations incurred in connection with or arising out of a
change of control of the Company; (viii) dividends payable on any Shares,
regardless of whether or not accrued, (ix) all costs and obligations of the
Company or any Subsidiary resulting from any claims made by the Companys or
its Subsidiaries current or former Shareholders or other equity holders, (x)
liability for any Taxes for any Tax period (or portion thereof) ending on or
before the Closing Date or as a result of the transactions contemplated
hereby, excluding additional taxes incurred as a result of the 338(h)(10)
Election other than such taxes due as a result of Section 1374 of the Code,
if any (xi) all outstanding liabilities under the Loan Agreement dated October
5, 2012 by and between Bank of America, N.A. (" _Bank_ ") and the Company,
(xii) any and all current and installment payment obligations pursuant to the
Share Sale and Purchase Deed dated October 20, 2011 by and among Net Optics

Urquhart, David Crawford Stuart Britt and Jane Margaret Britt, as amended by
that certain Deed of Variation  Share Sale and Purchase Deed dated October

David Crawford Stuart Britt and Jane Margaret Britt and Net Optics Australia
Pty Ltd, dated as of October 20, 2011, (xiii) all liabilities under or
pursuant to the Facility Offer between St. George Bank Limited and nMetrics
Pty Ltd dated April 4, 2007 and related Guarantee and Indemnity given by
Stephen John Urquhart and David Crawford Stuart Britt dated April 18, 2007 and

_Identified Debt_ "), and (xiv) all interest, any premiums payable or any
other costs or charges (including any prepayment penalties) on any
instruments or obligations described in clauses (i) through (xiii) hereof, all
as the same may be payable upon the complete and final payoff thereof,
regardless of whether such payoff occurs prior to, simultaneous with or
following the Closing. For purposes of this Agreement, " _Cash_ "shall mean
cash or cash equivalents (including marketable securities) of the Company and
its Subsidiaries, including all checks received by the Company or its
Subsidiaries but not yet cashed as of the Effective Time, net of all "cut" but
uncashed checks issued by the Company or its Subsidiaries that are outstanding
as of the Effective Time (to the extent not included as a current liability
in Net Working Capital). Any monetary conversion of a foreign currency to U.S.
Dollars shall be calculated using the applicable exchange rates set forth in
The Wall Street Journal, Eastern Edition, on the Closing Date.

1.12 _Escrow_.

 

(a) _Escrow Account_. On the Closing Date, Parent shall pay (or cause to be
paid), by wire transfer of immediately available funds, the Escrow Amount to
the Escrow Agent, to be held in escrow to satisfy, at least in part, any
claims by (i) Parent for satisfaction of any post-closing adjustment pursuant
to Section 1.11, (ii) any Parent Indemnified Person for any indemnification
claim pursuant to Section 8.2, or (iii) any Parent Indemnified Person pursuant
to this Agreement or in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby
(the " _Escrow Account_ "). The Escrow Agent shall hold and invest the Escrow
Amount in accordance with the terms of the Escrow Agreement and all interest
and earnings from the investment and

 



-15-  reinvestment of the Escrow Amount shall be added to the Escrow Account. The
Parties agree for all Tax purposes that: (i) the right of the Significant
Securityholders to the Escrow Amount shall be treated as deferred purchase
price eligible for installment sale treatment under Section 453 of the Code
and any corresponding provisions of state, local or non-U.S. law, as
appropriate, (ii) interest may be imputed on such amount, as required by
Section 483 or 1274 of the Code, and (iii) Parent shall be treated as the
owner of the Escrow Amount and all interest and earnings earned from the
investment and reinvestment of the Escrow Amount, or portion thereof, shall
be allocable to Parent pursuant to Section 468B(g) of the Code and Proposed
Treasury Regulations section 1.468B-8.

(b) _The Representative_. Upon any claim for indemnification pursuant to
Section 8.2, the Representative shall serve as the designated representative
of the Securityholders and Significant Securityholders for purposes of
receiving notices, contesting claims, and authorizing payments for such
claims. If the Securityholders and/or Significant Securityholders become
obligated (whether through mutual agreement between Parent and the
Representative, as a result of a final non-appealable judicial determination
or otherwise finally determined in accordance with the terms hereof or the
terms of the Escrow Agreement) to provide an adjustment, indemnification or
another payment pursuant to or in accordance with the terms of this
Agreement, Parent and the Representative shall, if necessary for the release
of funds from the Escrow Account, promptly execute joint written instructions
to the Escrow Agent to disburse the appropriate amount from the Escrow Account
in accordance with the terms of this Agreement and the Escrow Agreement.

(c) _Representative Expense Account_. At Closing, Parent shall withhold
the Representative Expense Amount from the Merger Consideration otherwise
payable pursuant to Section 1.4 and shall pay the Representative Expense
Amount to an account, separate from the Escrow Account, designated by the
Representative. The Representative Expense Amount shall be held, used and
disbursed by or at the direction of the Representative for the purpose of
paying fees and satisfying expenses of the Representative incurred in
connection with the discharge of its duties under this Agreement or the
Escrow Agreement, including the costs and expenses incurred by the
Representative in defending against any claim or liability in performing his
duties on behalf of the Securityholders. The Representative shall have the
right to recover all costs and expenses incurred hereunder from the
Representative Expense Amount as such costs and expenses arise. If any of the
Representative Expense Amount remains after the Representative has discharged
its duties under this Agreement, the Representative shall pay to each
Securityholder an amount equal to such Securityholders Percentage of such
excess. At all times, Securityholders shall be treated for all Tax purposes as
the owners of the Representative Expense Amount and all interest and earnings
thereon, if any.

(d) _Remaining Balance in Escrow Account_. Upon the expiration of the 9-month
period following the Closing Date, Parent and the Representative shall cause
the Escrow Agent (in accordance with the terms of the Escrow Agreement) to pay
(by wire transfer of immediately available funds) to the account(s) designated
by the Representative, any amounts in the Escrow Account in excess of the
amount equal to (i) eleven million eight hundred seventy-five thousand dollars
($11,875,000) (the " _Remaining Escrow Amount_ ") plus (ii) any interest
earned on the Remaining Escrow Amount, for distribution to the Significant
Securityholders in

 



-16-  accordance with the terms of the Escrow Agreement; _provided_ , _however_ ,
(A) that to the extent all or a portion of such excess amount has been claimed
by Parent to be owed to a Parent Indemnified Person, such claimed amount
shall not be paid by the Escrow Agent on such date and (B) that any amounts
payable to the Significant Securityholders with respect to Company Options
shall be paid to the Company or Parent for distribution to such Significant
Securityholders subject to any applicable Tax withholding requirements. On the
later of (i) the expiration of the 15-month period following the Closing Date
and (ii) March 31, 2015, Parent and the Representative shall cause the Escrow
Agent (in accordance with the terms of the Escrow Agreement) to pay (by wire
transfer of immediately available funds) to the account(s) designated by the
Representative, any remaining amounts in the Escrow Account (which have not
then been claimed by Parent to be owed to a Parent Indemnified Person),
together with any interest earned on any such amount, for distribution to the
Significant Securityholders in accordance with the terms of the
Escrow Agreement; _provided_ , _however_ , that any amounts payable to the
Significant Securityholders with respect to Company Options shall be paid to
the Company or Parent for distribution to such Significant Securityholders
subject to any applicable Tax withholding requirements.

(e) _Merger Consideration Adjustments_. Except for any interest amount(s) paid
thereon, any amounts distributed to Parent pursuant to the provisions of this
Section 1.12 shall be deemed to be and treated for all purposes as adjustments
to the Merger Consideration.

 

1.13 _Company Transaction Expenses_.

 

(a) _Estimated Company Transaction Expenses_. At least two Business Days prior
to the Closing Date, in accordance with Section 1.11(b), the Representative
shall provide to Parent an estimate (which estimate shall include such
reserves as the Representative determines in good faith to be appropriate for
any expenses that are not then known or determinable) on  _Schedule 1.13(a)_
of the Company Transaction Expenses (the " _Estimated Company Transaction
Expenses_ "). For purposes of this Agreement, " _Company Transaction Expenses_
" means all expenses incurred or to be incurred by the Company, its
Subsidiaries, the Securityholders and the Representative on behalf of the
Company, its Subsidiaries, the Securityholders or the Representative in
connection with the preparation, negotiation and execution of this Agreement
and the Escrow Agreement and/or the consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby (including, without limitation, the Merger), including,
but not limited to, all accounting, legal, investment banking and commercial
banking fees and expenses related thereto. For the avoidance of doubt,
Company Transaction Expenses shall exclude the fees and costs paid or payable
to the Companys auditors related to the review of the Interim Financials,
which shall be paid directly by Parent.

Parent shall pay (by wire transfer of immediately available funds): (i) to
Dorsey and Whitney LLP, the amount indicated in the Estimated Company

amounts paid under clauses (i)

 



-17-  through (ii) above, which the Representative shall use to promptly pay (and
in any event within five Business Days) the Estimated Company Transaction
Expenses, other than, or in addition to, those referenced in clauses (i)
through (ii) above.

(c) _Responsibility_. In no event shall Parent, the Company or, from and
after the Closing, the Surviving Company be responsible for payment of Company
Transaction Expenses and the Parties acknowledge that the payment of the
Estimated Company Transaction Expenses out of the Initial Cash Merger
Consideration by Parent as indicated in Section 1.4 is for convenience only
and in no way reflects any liability of Parent, the Company or, from and after
the Closing, the Surviving Company for the Company Transaction Expenses.

 

1.14 _Organizational Documents of the Surviving Company_. The Amended and
Restated Articles of Incorporation and Bylaws of the Surviving Company shall

the Surviving Company, effective as of the Effective Time, until their
successors shall have been duly elected and qualified or until their
earlier death, resignation or removal.

Actions_.

 

(a) Charlotte Matityahu has been appointed as the true and lawful attorney-in-
fact of each of (i) the Securityholders and (ii) the Significant
Securityholders for all matters in connection with this Agreement and the
Escrow Agreement (the " _Representative_ ") pursuant to and by virtue of the
requisite approval of this Agreement by the Securityholders.
The Representative (1) will act on behalf of the Securityholders with respect
to all matters requiring action by the Securityholders under this Agreement

Securityholders and/or Significant Securityholders under this Agreement or the
Escrow Agreement and may take any action contemplated by this Agreement or the
Escrow Agreement. By giving notice to the Representative in the
manner provided by Section 10.1, Parent shall be deemed to have given notice
to all Securityholders. By giving notice to the Representative in the manner
provided by Section 10.1, Parent shall be deemed to have given notice to all
Significant Securityholders. Any action taken by the Representative may be
considered by Parent to be the action of the Securityholder(s) and/or
Significant Securityholders, as applicable, for whom such action was taken for
all purposes of this Agreement or the Escrow Agreement.

(c) The Representative shall have the authority to determine, in his or her
sole judgment, and to make all other decisions required to be made by the
Securityholders in connection with the calculation of any Adjustment Amounts
described in Section 1.11 here,

 



-18-  including whether to retain counsel or other expert advice (and to select
that counsel or expert) to protect the Securityholders interests, subject to
Section 1.11, including without limitation whether to accept or dispute such
Adjustment Amounts.

(d) In the event that Parent or a Parent Indemnified Party gives notice to
the Representative of a claim for which indemnification may be sought, the

judgment, whether to retain counsel (and to select that counsel) to protect
the Securityholders and/or Significant Securityholders interests, subject
to Section 8.5, whether to consent to indemnification and to make all other
decisions required to be made by the Securityholders and/or
Significant Securityholders pursuant to this Agreement or the Escrow
Agreement, including without limitation whether to consent or withhold his or
her consent to any settlement or compromise of a claim.

 

(e) The Representative shall not be liable to any Securityholder for any act
or omission taken pursuant to or in conjunction with this Agreement, except
for his or her own gross negligence or willful misconduct. The Securityholders
shall indemnify and hold the Representative, and each successor thereof,
harmless from any and all liability and expenses (including,
without limitation, counsel fees) which may arise out of any action taken or
omitted by him or her as Representative in accordance with this Agreement or
the Escrow Agreement, as the same may be amended, modified or supplemented,
except such liability and expense as may result from the gross negligence or
willful misconduct of the Representative.

(f) The Representative agrees that within a commercially reasonable time
after receipt of notice of a claim, he or she shall give each Securityholder
and/or Significant Securityholder, as applicable, notice of the same and shall
from time to time keep the Securityholders and/or
Significant Securityholders, as applicable, apprised as to developments with
respect to such claim. Such notices shall be sent to the Securityholders at
their respective addresses as may be communicated to the Representative in
writing by the Securityholders. 

1.17 _Settlement of Cash; Payment of Indebtedness_. The Company and its
Subsidiaries shall pay in full at Closing the Identified Debt. The Company
shall use commercially reasonable efforts to cause all Cash of the Company as
of Closing to be used on or prior to the Closing Date, to the greatest extent
possible, to pay off any other Indebtedness of the Company, including
any interest and penalties in connection therewith. Any Cash or Indebtedness
remaining at the Company as of immediately following the Closing that was not
taken into account in calculating the Initial Merger Consideration shall
result in an adjustment to the Merger Consideration as provided in Section
1.4.

referred to herein specifically as a " _Non-U.S. Benefit Plan_ "")). True,
correct and complete copies of each Plan (and, if applicable, related trusts,
custodial arrangements or funding agreements or insurance policies) and all
amendments thereto have been made available to Parent along with, to the
extent applicable with respect to a Plan, a current summary plan description
(including any summaries of material modification), the three most recent
annual reports (Form 5500 including without limitation, all schedules thereto,
all financial statements with attached opinions of independent accountants,
and all actuarial reports), tax returns (Form 990) prepared in connection with
any such Plan or underlying trust, IRS determination letters and any
outstanding requests for a determination letter, all administrative services
agreements, HIPAA policies and procedures and HIPAA notices of privacy
practices and any policies and/or procedures used in Plan administration.
Other than amendments provided to Parent, no amendments have been made to or
promised with respect to any Plans. There are no negotiations, demands or
proposals which are pending or threatened or which have been made since the
Companys inception or any such Subsidiarys inception which concern matters
now covered, or that would be covered, by the foregoing Plans.

(b) Each Plan and each Plan-related trust agreement, annuity contract or
other funding instrument complies with and has been administered, operated and
maintained in compliance with its terms and in compliance with, and the
Company and its Subsidiaries, and their respective directors,
officers, employees and plan fiduciaries do not have any direct or indirect
liability under, the requirements prescribed by any and all federal, state and
local laws, statutes, orders, rules and regulations, including but not limited
to, the Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1985, as amended ("
_COBRA_ "), the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act, as
amendment (" _HIPAA_ "), the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as
amended (" _PPACA_ "), Section 1862(b)(4)(A)(i) of the Social Security Act,
ERISA and the Code, or any other Law applicable to such Plan. No events have
occurred with respect to any Plan that could result in any liabilities to the
Company, including payment or assessment by or against the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries of any excise taxes under Sections 4972, 4975, 4976, 4977,
4979, 4980B, 4980D, 4980E or 5000 of the Code.

 

(c) Each Plan that is intended to qualify under Section 401(a) or Section
509(c)(9) of the Code has received a favorable determination letter from the
Internal Revenue Service (a copy of which has been provided to Parent) or may
rely on the opinion letter issued to the prototype sponsor of the Plan
document and related trusts have been determined to be exempt from taxation.
Nothing has occurred that would cause, and no Action is pending or, to the
Companys knowledge, threatened, which could result in the loss of such
exemption or qualification. There are no outstanding defaults or violations by
any sponsor or fiduciary of any Plan or ERISA Plan and no Taxes, penalties or
fees are owing, other than Taxes and fees not yet

 



-53-  payable. There have been no improper withdrawals or transfers of assets from
any Plan or ERISA Plan or the trust or other funding media relating thereto
and none of the Shareholders, the Company or any of its Subsidiaries are or
have been in breach of any fiduciary obligation with respect to the
administration of any Plan or ERISA Plan or the trust or other funding media
relating thereto.

 

(d) Each Plan and related trust agreement, annuity contract or other funding
instrument is legal, valid and binding and in full force and effect, and
there are no defaults thereunder. None of the rights of the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries thereunder will be impaired by the consummation of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and all of the rights of the
Company and its Subsidiaries thereunder will be enforceable by Parent at or
after the Closing without the consent or agreement of any other party.

(e) Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries (i) has ever made, or has
ever been obligated to make any contributions to any multi-employer plan (as
defined in ERISA) or a Plan which is subject to the provisions of Title IV of
ERISA, (ii) has been a member of a controlled group which contributed to or
has had an obligation to contribute to any such plans and (iii) has been under
common control with an employer which contributed to or has had an obligation
to contribute to any such plans.

(f) Within the six-year period ending on the Closing Date, neither the Company
nor any of its Subsidiaries has terminated or taken action to terminate, in
part or in whole, any employee benefit plan, as defined in ERISA Section 3(3).

(g) Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries or other "disqualified
person" or "party in interest" (as defined in Section 4975(e)(2) of the Code
and Section 3(14) of ERISA, respectively) has engaged in any transactions in
connection with any Plan that would result in the imposition of a penalty
pursuant to Section 502(i) of ERISA or a tax pursuant to Section 4975 of the
Code. Except as set forth on _Schedule 2.24(g)_ , neither the Company nor any
of its Subsidiaries has any liability or obligation to provide life, medical
or other welfare benefits to former or retired employees, other than as
required by COBRA.

 

(h) With respect to any Plan which is a welfare plan as defined in Section
3(1) of ERISA: (i) each such welfare plan which is intended to meet the
requirements for tax-favored treatment under Subchapter B of Chapter 1 of the
Code meets such requirements (and a copy of the ruling letter with respect to
any Voluntary Employees Beneficiary Association of a Plan has been provided
to Parent); and (ii) there is no disqualified benefit (as such term is defined
in Code Section 4976(b)) which would subject the Company, its Subsidiaries or
Parent to a tax under Code Section 4976(a).

 

(i) Full payment has been made of all amounts due under each of the Plans and
to each person employed or formerly employed by the Company that are required
under the terms of the Plans, and all obligations regarding the Plans required
to be satisfied prior to the date hereof have been satisfied. Each of the
Company and its Subsidiaries has made all required allocations to pension
funds or management insurance pursuant to its employment agreements

 



-54-  during the entire employment period of its employees. The Company and its
Subsidiaries have not made any contributions to any defined benefits plan.

 

(j) Except as set forth on _Schedule 2.24(j)_ , all contributions with respect
to the Plans for all periods ending prior to the Closing Date (including
periods from the first day of the current plan year to the Closing Date) will
be made prior to the Closing Date by the Company and all members of the
controlled group in accordance with past practice. All contributions to the
Plans have been made on a timely basis in accordance with all applicable Law,
including but not limited to ERISA and the Code.

(k) All insurance premiums have been paid in full, subject only to normal
retrospective adjustments in the ordinary course, to the extent applicable to
the Plans for policy years or other applicable policy periods ending on or
before the Closing Date.

 

(l) There is no pending or threatened legal action, proceeding or
investigation, suit, grievance, arbitration or other manner of litigation,
or claim against or involving any Plan described in _Schedule 2.24(a)_ hereof
and, to the Companys knowledge, no facts exist that would give rise to any
legal action, proceeding or investigation, suit, grievance, arbitration or
other manner of litigation, or claim, other than routine claim for benefits.
Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has any liability by virtue of
its being a member of a controlled group with a person who has liability under
the Code or ERISA.

 

(m) All expenses and liabilities relating to all of the Plans described on
_Schedule 2.24_ have been, and will be on the Closing Date, fully and
properly accrued on the books and records of the Company and its Subsidiaries
and fairly represent the financial conditions of such Plans in accordance with
GAAP. For the three most recent fiscal years for which an annual report has
been filed, the Plans have either qualified for a waiver of examination and
report of an independent public account under 29 C.F.R. 2520.104-46 or the
special rule set forth in 29.C.F.R. 2520.103-1(d).

 

(n) Each Plan (including any Plan covering former employees and/or retirees of
the Company and its Subsidiaries) may be unilaterally amended, varied,
modified or terminated in whole or in part by the Company, its Subsidiaries or
Parent on or at any time after the Closing Date, and the Company or its
Subsidiaries may take contribution holidays or withdraw surplus from each
Plan, subject only to approvals required by applicable Law and the terms of
such Plan.

(o) Each plan, agreement or arrangement which provides for the deferral of
compensation subject to Code Section 409A is, and has been since January 1,
2009, properly documented in writing in accordance with the Treasury
Regulations promulgated thereunder and has, since January 1, 2009,
been operated in compliance with such provisions in effect from time to time
since such date. No employee or former employee of the Company is subject to
any tax or penalty under Code Section 409A due to a documentary or operational
failure thereunder.

(p) Except as set forth in _Schedule 2.24(p)_ , the consummation of the
transaction contemplated by this Agreement, other than by reason of actions
taken by Parent

 



-55-  following the Closing, will not (i) entitle any current or former employee
of the Company or its Subsidiaries to severance pay, unemployment compensation
or any other payment, (ii) accelerate the time of payment or vesting, or
increase the amount of any compensation due to any current or former employee
of the Company or its Subsidiaries, or (iii) give rise to the payment of any
amount that would not be deductible pursuant to Code Section 280G.

(q) All statutory and nonstatutory options granted under any compensation plan
sponsored or maintained by the Company or its Subsidiaries which were
scheduled to vest on or after January 1, 2005, reflect an exercise price of at
least the fair market value of the underlying common stock as of the date of
grant.

 

(r) Prior to Closing, each Shareholder who has amounts owed to the Company
pursuant to one or more promissory notes or other evidences of indebtedness
arising from a loan or loans provided by the Company for purposes of
facilitating the exercise of one or more Company Options has paid in full the
entire amount of such outstanding owed amounts, including any accrued
interest, to the Company in a cash lump sum payment.

(s) Each Non-U.S. Benefit Plan complies with and has been administered,
operated and maintained in compliance with its terms and in compliance with
all applicable international and local Laws and is in good standing with
applicable Governmental Authorities. Each Non-U.S. Benefit Plan that is
required to be funded is fully funded, and with respect to all other Non-U.S.
Benefit Plans, adequate reserves therefor have been established on the
accounting statements of the applicable Company or Subsidiary entity. All
employer and employee contributions to each Non-U.S. Benefit Plan have been
made, or, if applicable, accrued in accordance with normal accounting
practices as required by applicable Law or by the terms of such Non-U.S.
Benefit Plan. No liability or obligation of the Company or its Subsidiaries
exists with respect to any Non-U.S. Benefit Plan.

2.25 _Overtime, Back Wages, Vacation and Minimum Wage_. No present or former
employee of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries has given notice to the

case with the date such claim was made, the amount claimed, the disposition or
status of such claim (including settlement or judgment amount), and the amount
of attorneys fees incurred in connection with such claim. The aggregate loss
and expense (including out-of-pocket expenses) attributable to all product

unless and to the extent with respect to clauses (i), (ii), (iii) or (iv),
such change, event, circumstance, or development (a) specifically affects or
relates to (or has the effect of specifically affecting or relating to) the
Company, or (b) is materially and disproportionately adverse to the Company as

Disclosure Schedule, or (ii) that is necessary to correct any information in
such Disclosure Schedule that is inaccurate on account of the occurrence of
an event described in subsection (i). No such supplemental information shall

condition precedent in Section 7.3) or negate any indemnity hereunder.

 

5.4 _Access to Information_. To the maximum extent permitted by applicable Law
and subject to the Non-Disclosure Agreement dated as of May 31, 2013 between

furnish promptly to Parent all other information concerning the Companys and
its Subsidiaries business, properties and personnel as Parent may reasonably
request, provided that no investigation pursuant to this Section 5.4 shall
affect or modify any representation or warranty or any liability with respect
thereto. Parent shall hold, and shall cause its officers, employees,
accountants, counsel, financial advisors and other representatives
and Affiliates to hold, any nonpublic information in accordance with the
terms of the Confidentiality Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing
provisions of this Section 5.4, (a) the Company shall not be required to take
any action that would, in the good faith judgment of the Company, constitute
a waiver of the attorney-client or similar privilege held by the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries or violate confidentiality obligations owing to Third
Parties; provided, however, that the Company shall make a good faith effort
to accommodate any request from Parent for access or information pursuant to
this Section in a manner that does not result in such a waiver or violation,
(b) Parent shall not have access to personnel records of the Company relating
to individual performance or evaluation records, medical histories or other
information if such disclosure by the Company would violate any applicable
federal, state or local law and (c) any access to the Companys properties

requirements and shall not include the right to perform any "invasive"
testing. In addition, Parent shall not contact any personnel or customers of

information. During the term of this Agreement, none of the Company, any of

unsolicited bona fide Acquisition Proposal that the Board of Directors of the
Company reasonably believes (after considering the advice of a financial
advisor of nationally recognized reputation and outside legal counsel) will
lead to a Superior Proposal, (ii) thereafter furnish to such Third Party
nonpublic information relating to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
pursuant to a confidentiality agreement with terms no less favorable to the
Company than those contained in the Confidentiality Agreement (a copy of which
shall be provided, promptly after its execution, for informational purposes
only to Parent); provided that all such information (to the extent that such
information has not been previously provided or made available to Parent) is
provided or made available to Parent, as the case may be, prior to
or substantially concurrently with the time it is provided or made available
to such Third Party) and (iii) following receipt of a Superior Proposal after
the date of this Agreement, make an Adverse Recommendation Change, but in each
case referred to in the foregoing clauses (i) through (iii) only if the Board
of Directors of the Company determines in good faith by a majority vote, after
considering advice from outside legal counsel to the Company, that the failure
to take such action is inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under
Applicable Law.

-71-  Company shall continue to advise Parent after taking such action of the
status and terms of any discussions and negotiations with the Third Party. In
addition, the Company shall notify Parent promptly (but in no event later
than 24 hours) after receipt by the Company (or any of its Subsidiaries or

Subsidiaries by any Third Party that may be considering making, or has made,
an Acquisition Proposal, which notice shall be provided orally and in writing
and shall identify the Third Party making, and the terms and conditions of,
any such Acquisition Proposal, indication or request (including any changes
thereto). The Company shall keep Parent fully informed, on a current basis,
of the status and details of any such Acquisition Proposal, indication or
request (including any changes thereto) and shall promptly (but in no event

Proposal for all of the outstanding Shares on terms that the Board of

and conditions of the Acquisition Proposal would result in a transaction (i)
that if consummated, is materially more favorable to Shareholders from a
financial point of view than the Merger or, if applicable, any proposal by
Parent to amend the terms of this Agreement taking into account all the terms
and conditions of such proposal and this Agreement (including the expected
timing and likelihood of consummation, taking into account any governmental
and other approval requirements), (ii) that is reasonably capable of being
completed on the terms proposed, taking into account the identity of the
person making the proposal, any approval requirements and all

Party shall issue any such press release, make any such statement or
communication or schedule any such press conference or conference call without
the consent of the other Party.

7.6 _Further Assurances_. From and after the Closing, the Parties shall do
such acts and execute such documents and instruments as may be reasonably
required to make effective the transactions contemplated hereby.

7.7 _Taxes_.

 

(a) All stamp, transfer, documentary, sales, use, withholding, registration
and other such Taxes, levies and fees, including any penalties and interest,
and all conveyance fees, recording charges and other fees and charges incurred
by the Company or its Subsidiary directly or indirectly in connection with
consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement shall be paid
by the Securityholders when due, regardless of whether such Taxes are imposed
on the Company, a Subsidiary, Surviving Company, or Parent. The Representative
(on behalf of the Securityholders) will, at its own expense, file all
necessary Tax Returns and other documentation with respect to all such Taxes,
fees and charges, and if required by applicable Law, Parent will join in the
execution of any such Tax Returns and other documentation. Each Securityholder
shall remain liable for any Taxes imposed on him as a result of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

(b) Representative shall prepare or cause to be prepared (in a manner
consistent with the Companys past practice except as otherwise required by
applicable Tax Law), and timely file or cause to be filed, at the Significant
Securityholders cost and expense, all Income Tax Returns of the Company and
its Subsidiaries for any Tax year or period ending on or before the Closing
Date that are due after the Closing Date (" _Pre-Closing Period_ ").
Representative shall provide Parent with a draft of any such proposed
Tax Return for any Pre-Closing Period (" _Pre-Closing Period Income Tax
Returns_ ") in a form ready for filing no less than 30 days prior to the due
date of such Pre-Closing Period Income Tax Return, including any extensions of
time to file in effect. Representative shall consider in good faith any
comments or proposed revisions to any such Pre-Closing Period Income Tax
Return that Parent submits to Representative in writing no later than ten days
following the Parents receipt of such Pre-Closing Period Income Tax Return
and incorporate any comments or proposed revisions if Parent reasonably
believes that filing such Pre-Closing Period Income Tax Return without such
comments or proposed revisions may subject Parent to penalties or additions
to Tax. All Taxes payable with respect to the Tax Returns to be filed pursuant
to this Section 7.7(b) (excluding additional taxes incurred as a result of the
338(h)(10) Election other than such taxes due as a result of Section 1374 of
the Code, if any) shall be borne by the Significant Securityholders and

 



-79-  paid to Parent no later than seven Business Days prior to the due date for
filing such Tax Returns to the extent such Taxes are not reflected in the
Final Closing Indebtedness. Parent shall cause Company to timely file all Tax
Returns described in this Section 7.7(b) and remit the corresponding Taxes
reflected thereon to the appropriate Tax authorities.

 

(c) Parent shall prepare or cause to be prepared, and file or cause to be
filed, all Tax Returns of the Company and its Subsidiaries and the Surviving
Company for (x) any Pre-Closing Period that is not a Pre-Closing Period Income
Tax Return and (y) for any Tax year or period beginning on or before and
ending after the Closing Date (a " _Straddle Period_ "). Parent shall provide
to the Representative a draft of each such Tax Return to the extent the Tax
liability on such Tax Return exceeds the accrual for Taxes on the Closing
Balance Sheet no later than (i) 30 days prior to the due date of each such
Tax Return, that relates to Income Taxes, or (ii) 5 days prior to the due
date of each such Tax Return that does not relate to Income Taxes. Parent
shall revise such Tax Returns to reflect Representatives comments and
proposed revisions that are provided no later than 2 days prior to the
applicable due date, unless Parent believes in good faith that such comments
and revisions are materially detrimental to Parent. Any disputes between
Parent and the Representatives with respect to such Tax Returns and
Representatives comments thereto shall be resolved by the Auditor in a manner
similar to that described in Section 1.10(b). If a Tax Return as filed does
not conform to the Auditors determination, Parent will amend any applicable
Tax Return. The Representative shall pay to Parent within seven Business Days
after the date on which Taxes are paid for any Straddle Period, an amount
equal to the portion of such Taxes for the portion of such Straddle Period
ending on the Closing Date, except to the extent such Taxes are reflected in
the Final Closing Indebtedness. For the purposes of this Section 7.7(c), in
the case of any Taxes that are imposed on a periodic basis and are payable
with respect to a Straddle Period, the portion of such Taxes for the portion
of such Straddle Period ending on the Closing Date shall (i) in the case of
any Taxes other than an Income Tax, be deemed to be the amount of such Taxes
for the entire Straddle Period multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of
which is the number of days in the Straddle Period ending on the Closing Date,
and the denominator of which is the number of days in the entire Straddle
Period, and (ii) in the case of any Income Tax, be deemed to be equal to the
amount that would be payable if the relevant Tax period ended on the Closing
Date pursuant to an interim closing-of-the-books. Any credits or refunds
relating to a Straddle Period shall be taken into account as though the
relevant Tax period ended on the Closing Date. All determinations necessary to
give effect to the allocations described in this Section 7.7(c) shall be made
in a manner consistent with the prior practice of the Company, except for
changes required by Law. Such Tax Returns shall be prepared in a manner
consistent with the prior practices of the Company, provided that such prior
practices are in accordance with applicable Law. For purposes of any amount
that is required to be included under Section 951(a) of the Code for the
Company or its Subsidiaries with respect to a Straddle Period, the amount of
income required to be included under Section 951(a) of the Code for the
portion of the Straddle Period ending on the Closing Date (the " _Pre-Closing
Section 951 Amount_" ) shall be determined based on an interim closing-of-
the-books as of the end of the Closing Date (and for such purpose, the taxable
period of any pass-through entity in which the Company or its Subsidiaries
holds a beneficial interest shall be deemed to terminate at such time);
provided that the calculation of the Pre-Closing Section 951 Amount shall
include the concepts set forth in Section 951(a)(2)(B) of the Code.

 



-80- (d) The Representative and Parent agree to furnish or cause to be furnished to
each other, upon request, as promptly as practical, such information
(including reasonable access to books and records, Tax Returns and Tax
filings) and assistance as is reasonably necessary for the filing of any Tax
Return, the conduct of any Tax audit, and for the prosecution or defense of
any claim, suit or proceeding relating to any Tax matter. The Representative
and Parent shall cooperate with each other in the conduct of any Tax audit or
other Tax proceedings and each shall execute and deliver such powers of
attorney and other documents as are necessary to carry out the intent of this
Section 7.7. Any Tax audit or other Tax proceeding shall be deemed to be a
Third-Person Claim subject to the procedures set forth in Section 8.5 of
this Agreement.

(e) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary, the Parties agree that all
transactions occurring on the Closing Date shall be reported in a Pre-Closing
Period Tax Return to the extent permitted by Treasury Regulations section
1.1502-76(b)(1)(ii)(B).

(f) Prior to the Closing Date, the Company shall terminate any intercompany
agreements or obligations, if any, and settle any intercompany accounts
between or among any of the Company and its Subsidiaries and satisfy the
covenant set forth in Section 5.14. 

(g) Each Shareholder covenants and agrees to join with Parent to make an
election pursuant to Section 338(h)(10) of the Code (and any comparable
election under state, local or non-U.S. Law) (" _338(h)(10) Election_ "), to
execute any and all documents, take all actions, and file such forms
(including IRS Form 8023) as necessary to effectuate such election.
Parent shall prepare an allocation of the Merger Consideration and
liabilities of the Company among the Companys assets and covenants contained
in the Securityholder Non-Competition Agreement in accordance with Sections
1060 and 338 of the Code, which allocation shall be provided to the
Representative for the Representatives review, subject to the allocation for
the Securityholder Non-Competition Agreement which is set forth on Schedule
7.7(g). If the Parties agree as to such allocation, the Parties shall report
for all Tax purposes (including without limitation report on IRS Form 8883)
the allocation of the Merger Consideration and liabilities of the Company in a
manner consistent with this Section 7.7(g) and such allocation and shall take
no Tax position contrary thereto.

(h) Parent shall pay an amount (the " _Gross Up_ "), calculated in accordance
with Schedule 7.7(h), to each Shareholder to compensate such Shareholder for
the tax cost solely attributable to the increased liability for U.S. federal
and state income tax and, if applicable, corporate level state taxes (if
payable by the Shareholders or Significant Securityholders pursuant to this
Agreement), as a result of (i) the Section 338(h)(10) Election and (ii) an
additional amount to satisfy the federal and state tax liability resulting
from the receipt of the amount described in clause (i) of this Section
7.7(h); provided, however, that (i) the Gross Up shall be net of any Tax
benefit received by the Shareholders with respect to the cashing out of the
Company Options pursuant to Section 1.7(a) and other costs arising from the
transactions contemplated hereby but only after such benefit is first used to
offset any salaries or other ordinary income received from the Company by the
Shareholders and (ii) the Gross Up shall be determined under the assumption
that each Shareholders sole source of income or loss is with respect to its
ownership of Shares of the Company. Shareholders shall deliver to the Parent
within thirty (30) days after the Closing Date a detailed computation of the
Gross Up and such

 



-81- other schedules and information that may be relevant to such computation for
Parents approval, which shall not be unreasonably withheld. Such computation
shall be determined by using the highest blended federal and California state
tax rate applicable to individuals, and take into account the state taxes
applicable to corporations. In the event that the amount in clause (i) is
negative, no amount under clause (ii) shall be payable. Should the 338(h)(10)
Election be audited and, in turn, a reallocation by the Internal Revenue
Service results in the imposition of additional Taxes upon the Shareholders,
the foregoing calculation shall be adjusted. Parent shall promptly pay to
Shareholders the Gross Up in order to allow timely payment of the applicable
Taxes. Parent hereby agrees to file the Tax Returns of the Company and
the Shareholders agree to file their respective Tax Returns in a manner
consistent with the Gross Up. The Gross Up shall be treated as an adjustment
to Merger Consideration for all Tax purposes to the extent permitted by Law.

 

(i) The Company and Shareholders shall not revoke the Companys election to be
taxed as an S corporation within the meaning of Sections 1361 and 1362 of the
Code or any other corresponding provision of state or local law. The Company
and Shareholders shall not take or allow any action (other than the sale of
the Shares pursuant to this Agreement) that would result in the
termination of the Companys status as a validly electing S corporation
within the meaning of Sections 1361 and 1362 of the Code.

(j) If any Tax authority determines or proposes to determine that the Company
did not have a valid election in effect under Section 1362(a) of the Code to
be treated as an S corporation as of the Closing Date (without regard to the
transfer of Shares under this Agreement), the Sellers shall cooperate with
Parent, and use their reasonable best efforts, to obtain from the IRS a waiver
of the termination and reinstatement of such S corporation status through the
Closing Date pursuant to Section 1362(f) (or any similar relief available
with respect to state and local income taxation). In the event of such a
challenge to the S corporation status of the Company, the Shareholders shall
promptly take all reasonable steps pursuant to Section 1362(f)(3) of the
Code, and shall make such adjustments as may be required by the IRS pursuant
to Section 1362(f)(4) as a condition of obtaining such waiver and
reinstatement of S corporation status through the Closing Date (and any
similar adjustments required under analogous state and local tax provisions).
The Shareholders shall bear the entire expense of procuring the waiver and
reinstatement of S corporation status of the Company described above,
including the legal, accounting and Tax costs of taking such steps and of
making such adjustments as may be reasonably required.

(k) Neither the Company nor its Shareholders shall settle or otherwise
resolve a proposed Tax adjustment that relates to any Tax period (or portion
thereof) ending on or before the Closing Date in a manner that would increase
the Tax liability of Parent, the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, or an
Affiliate of any of the foregoing, in a Tax period (or portion thereof) ending
after the Closing Date without the prior written consent of Parent, which
consent shall not be unreasonably withheld.

 

(l) None of the Parent, the Company or any Affiliate thereof shall settle or
otherwise resolve a proposed Tax adjustment that relates to any Tax period
(or portion thereof) ending after the Closing Date in a manner that would
increase the Tax liability of the

 



-82-  Shareholders in a Tax period (or portion thereof) ending on or before the
Closing Date without the prior written consent of the Shareholders, which
consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, but only to the extent such
proposed Tax adjustment relates to Taxes for which Parent would otherwise be
indemnified pursuant to Section 8.2(a)(vii).

ancillary document;

 

(iii) any Indebtedness of the Company immediately prior to the Closing, but
only to the extent not taken into account in determining the Merger
Consideration;

(iv) any Company Transaction Expenses, but only to the extent not taken into
account in determining the Merger Consideration;

(v) any claims made by current or former holders of any equity or debt of
the Company (including, without limitation, the holders of any Common Stock
or any options or warrants to purchase equity or debt of the Company) of any
kind or nature whatsoever, in such capacity as an equity or debt holder or any
other capacity, in each case whether absolute or contingent, liquidated or
unliquidated, known or unknown, and whether arising under any agreement or
understanding (other than those of the Shareholders arising under this
Agreement or any of the other agreements executed and delivered by Parent in
connection herewith) or otherwise at law or equity (other than claims for
which the facts or circumstances giving rise to such claim first occur
following the Effective Time);

 

(vi) any claims for appraisal or dissenters rights with respect to any Shares
under CGCL or any other applicable Law; or 

(vii) Taxes of the Company or any Subsidiary, or their liability, if any (for

payable with respect to Taxes claimed or assessed against the Company for any
Tax period (or portion thereof) ending on or before the Closing Date or as a
result of the transactions contemplated hereby (to the extent such Taxes are
not reflected in the Final Closing Indebtedness);

 

(viii) the matters set forth on Schedule 8.2(a)(viii) (the " _Scheduled
Indemnity Matters_ ").

 

(b) In consideration of the Parents agreement to pay the Merger
Consideration, the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby and
other good and valuable consideration (the receipt and sufficiency of which is
hereby agreed to and acknowledged), by execution of the Side Agreements, the
Significant Securityholders shall severally and not jointly indemnify and hold
harmless each of the Parent Indemnified Persons from and against, and each
Significant Securityholder shall thereby waive any claim for contribution or
indemnity from any of the Parent Indemnified Persons with respect to such
Significant Securityholders Percentage of, any Indemnified Losses incurred
or to be incurred by any of the Parent Indemnified Persons resulting from,
arising out of, Section 8.2(a)(i) through

 



-84-  Section 8.2(a)(vii) or fraud, willful misconduct or intentional
misrepresentation. For purposes of this Agreement, the term " _Percentage_ "
means, with respect to each Significant Securityholder, the amount calculated
as follows and expressed as a percentage: the aggregate Merger Consideration
which such Significant Securityholder is entitled to receive (including Merger
Consideration payable to Significant Securityholders pursuant to Section 1.7)
hereunder divided by the aggregate Merger Consideration payable to all
Significant Securityholders hereunder (including Merger Consideration payable
to Significant Securityholders pursuant to Section 1.7). Any amounts owed to
Parent Indemnified Persons for such Indemnified Losses shall first be paid out
of the Escrow Account in accordance with the Escrow Agreement and then, to the
extent that such Indemnified Losses exceed the then available balance in the
Escrow Account or indemnification for such Indemnified Losses is due after
termination of the Escrow Account, pursuant to this Section 8.2(b). Except for
Indemnified Losses resulting from, arising out of, or directly or indirectly
connected to fraud, willful misconduct or intentional misrepresentation, a
Significant Securityholders obligations under this Section 8.2(b) shall not
exceed the aggregate amount of Merger Consideration paid or payable to
such Significant Securityholder.

(c) By execution of a Side Agreement, Letter of Transmittal and/or Option
Cancellation Agreement, each Securityholder shall severally and not jointly
hold the Parent Indemnified Persons harmless and indemnify each of them from
and against, and each Securityholder waives any claim for contribution or
indemnity from any of the Parent Indemnified Persons (including the Surviving
Company and the Company) with respect to, any and all Indemnified Losses
incurred or to be incurred by any of them resulting from or arising out of:

 

(i) any breach of any representation or warranty made by such Securityholder
in such Side Agreement, Letter of Transmittal and/or Option Cancellation
Agreement, it being agreed and acknowledged that with respect to this Section
8.2(c)(i) each Securityholder is providing indemnity only with respect to
breaches of representations and warranties made by such Securityholder in
such Side Agreement Letter of Transmittal and/or Option Cancellation Agreement
and not those of any other Securityholder in any other Side Agreement, Letter
of Transmittal and/or Option Cancellation Agreement and that
each Securityholder shall be liable under this Section 8.2(c)(i) only for the
Indemnified Losses for which such Securityholder is providing indemnity under
this Section 8.2(c)(i), without being limited to such Securityholders
percentage thereof and no other Securityholder shall be liable for any such
Indemnified Losses; or

(ii) any nonfulfillment, nonperformance, nonobservance or other breach or
violation, or default in performance, by such Securityholder of any covenant
or agreement of such Securityholder contained in such Side Agreement, Letter
of Transmittal and/or Option Cancellation Agreement it being agreed and
acknowledged that with respect to this Section 8.2(c)(ii) each Securityholder
is providing indemnity only with respect to the nonfulfillment,
nonperformance, nonobservance or other breach or violation, or default in
performance, of the covenants and agreements made by such Securityholder in
such Side Agreement, Letter of Transmittal and/or Option Cancellation
Agreement and not with respect to those of any other Securityholders in any
other Side 

 



-85-  Agreement, Letter of Transmittal and/or Option Cancellation Agreement and
that each Securityholder shall be liable under this Section 8.2(c)(ii) only
for the Indemnified Losses for which such Securityholder is providing
indemnity under this Section 8.2(c)(ii), without being limited to such
Securityholders percentage thereof and no other Securityholder shall be
liable for any such Indemnified Losses.

 

(d) Prior to the Closing, the Parent Indemnified Persons shall be entitled to
recover any Indemnified Losses to which they are entitled hereunder from the
Company under this Agreement or from the Securityholders under this Agreement
and the Side Agreements, Letters of Transmittal and/or Option Cancellation
Agreements. From and after the Closing, the Parent Indemnified Parties
shall be entitled to recover any Indemnified Losses to which they are
entitled hereunder from the Escrow Account or pursuant to the Side Agreements,
Letters of Transmittal and/or Option Cancellation Agreements.

 

(e) For all Tax purposes, all indemnification payments under this Article 8
shall be treated by the Parties as adjustments to the Merger Consideration to
the extent permitted by applicable Law.

(f) For the avoidance of doubt, a Parent Indemnified Person shall be entitled
to recover any Indemnified Losses under Section 8.2(a)(viii) even if such
Indemnified Losses may also be recovered under Section 8.2(a)(i); provided,
that any Indemnified Losses satisfied by virtue of a claim made under Section
8.2(a)(viii) shall not be counted against the Indemnification Threshold.

8.3 _Indemnification of the Significant Securityholders_. Subject to the
limitations contained in this Article 8, Parent shall hold the Significant
Securityholders, and the members, directors, officers, partners, employees,
successors, assigns, representatives and agents of each of them in their
capacities as such (the " _Securityholders Indemnified Persons_ ") harmless
and indemnify each of them from and against any and all Indemnified Losses
incurred or to be incurred by any of them, resulting from or arising out of:

(a) any breach of any representation or warranty made by Parent in this
Agreement or any ancillary document; or

 

(b) any nonfulfillment, nonperformance, nonobservance or other breach or
violation, or default in performance, by Parent of any covenant or agreement
of Parent contained in this Agreement, the Escrow Agreement or any ancillary
document.

8.4 _Notice of Claim_. In the event that Parent seeks indemnification on
behalf of a Parent Indemnified Person, or the Representative or a Significant
Securityholder seeks indemnification on behalf of a Securityholder Indemnified
Person, in each case other than a Third Person Claim, such Party seeking
indemnification (the " _Indemnified Party_ ") shall give reasonably prompt
written notice in accordance with Section 10.1 to the indemnifying Party (the
" _Indemnifying Party_ ") specifying the facts constituting the basis for
such claim and the amount, to the extent known, of the claim asserted;
_provided_ , _however_ , that the right of a Person to be indemnified
hereunder shall not be adversely affected by a failure to give such notice
unless, and

 



-86-  then only to the extent that, an Indemnifying Party is actually and
materially damaged and prejudiced thereby. Subject to the terms of this
Agreement, the Indemnifying Party shall pay (by wire transfer of immediately
available funds) the amount of any valid claim not more than 30 days after the
Indemnified Party provides notice to the Indemnifying Party of such amount.
For purposes of this Article 8, the Representative has the full authority to
act on behalf of the Securityholders, the Significant Securityholders and the
Securityholder Indemnified Persons as either an Indemnifying Party or the
Indemnified Party, provided that as set forth in this Agreement, Parent shall
be deemed to have given notice to all Securityholders and Significant
Securityholders pursuant to giving notice to the Representative.

8.5  _Right to Contest Claims of Third Persons_.

(a) If an Indemnified Party is entitled to indemnification hereunder because
of a claim asserted by any claimant other than an Indemnified Person
hereunder (a " _Third Person_ "), the Indemnified Party shall give the
Indemnifying Party reasonably prompt notice thereof after such assertion is
actually known to the Indemnified Party; provided, however, that the right of
a Person to be indemnified hereunder in respect of claims made by a Third
Person shall not be adversely affected by a failure to give such notice
unless, and then only to the extent that, an Indemnifying Party is actually
and materially prejudiced thereby. Except as otherwise provided in this
Section 8.5, the Indemnifying Party shall then have the right, upon written
notice to the Indemnified Party (a " _Defense Notice_ ") within 30 days after
receipt from the Indemnified Party of notice of such claim, and using counsel
reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnified Party, to investigate, contest, or
settle the claim alleged by such Third Person (a " _Third Person Claim_ "),
provided that the Indemnifying Party has unconditionally acknowledged to the
Indemnified Party in writing its obligation to indemnify the Persons to be
indemnified hereunder with respect to such Third Person Claim and to
discharge any cost or expense arising out of such investigation, contest or
settlement. The Indemnified Party may thereafter participate in (but not
control) the defense of any such Third Person Claim with its own counsel at
its own expense, unless separate representation is necessary to avoid a
conflict of interest, in which case such representation shall be at the
expense of the Indemnifying Party. Unless and until the Indemnifying Party so
acknowledges its obligation to indemnify, the Indemnified Party shall have
the right, at its option, to assume and control defense of the matter and to
demand and receive from the Indemnifying Party, subject to the Indemnifying
Partys right to dispute its obligation to indemnify the Indemnified Party,
the full amount of the reasonable costs of defense. In the event that the
Indemnifying Party shall fail to give the Defense Notice within said 30 day
period, (i) the Indemnified Party shall be entitled to have the control over
said defense and settlement of the subject claim, (ii) the Indemnifying Party
will cooperate with and make available to the Indemnified Party such
assistance and materials as it may reasonably request, (iii) the Indemnifying
Party shall have the right at its expense to participate in the defense
assisted by counsel of its own choosing, and (iv) the Indemnifying Party, if
it is required to provide indemnification under this Agreement, will be liable
for all costs and settlement amounts paid or incurred in connection
therewith.

(b) In the event that the Indemnifying Party delivers a Defense Notice with
respect to such Third Person Claim within 30 days after receipt thereof and
thereby elects to conduct the defense of the subject claim, (i) the
Indemnifying Party shall be entitled to have

 



-87- control over said defense and, subject to the provisions set forth below,
settlement of the subject claim, (ii) the Indemnified Party will cooperate
with and make available to the Indemnifying Party such assistance and
materials as it may reasonably request, and (iii) the Indemnified Party shall
have the rights at its expense to participate in the defense assisted by
counsel of its own choosing. In such an event, the Indemnifying Party will not
settle the subject claim without the prior written consent of the Indemnified
Party, which consent will not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or
delayed unless (i) there is no finding or admission of any violation of Law or
any violation of the rights of any Person, (ii) the sole relief provided is
monetary damages that are paid in full by the Indemnifying Party, and (iii)
the Indemnified Party shall have no liability with respect to any compromise
or settlement of such Third Person Claims effected without its consent, in
which cases the consent of the Indemnified Party shall not be required.

 

(c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Section 8.5,
the Indemnifying Party shall not be entitled to control, but may participate
in, and the Indemnified Party shall be entitled to have sole control,
including the right to select defense counsel, over the defense or settlement
of any claim (i) that seeks a temporary restraining order, a preliminary
or permanent injunction or specific performance against the Indemnified
Party, (ii) that involves criminal allegations against the Indemnified Party,
(iii) that, if unsuccessful, (A) would set a precedent that would materially
interfere with, or have a material adverse effect on, the business or
financial condition of the Indemnified Party or (B) would reasonably be
expected to exceed the then available balance of the Escrow Account, as
mutually determined by the Indemnifying Party and the Indemnified Party or,
if such a determination is not made within 15 days after the date on which the
Indemnified Party responds to the Defense Notice by asserting its rights under
this Section 8.5(c), in accordance with its reasonable judgment, (iv) subject
to clause (iii)(B) above, that imposes liability on the part of the
Indemnified Party for which the Indemnified Party is not entitled to
indemnification hereunder, or (v) in the case of the Parent Indemnified
Persons, that is subject to a claim for indemnification under Section
8.2(a)(v). In such event, the Indemnifying Party will still be subject to its
obligations hereunder, but the Indemnified Party will not settle the subject
claim without the prior written consent of the Indemnifying Party, which
consent will not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed.

8.6  _Limitations on Indemnity_.

(a) From and after the Closing, the Parent Indemnified Persons shall not be
entitled to indemnification in respect of any Indemnified Losses pursuant to
Section 8.2(a)(i) resulting from or arising out of breaches of the
representations and warranties contained in Article 2 of this Agreement unless
and until such Indemnified Losses exceed $750,000 in the aggregate (the "
_Indemnification Threshold_ ") at which point the Parent Indemnified Persons
shall be entitled to indemnification in respect of all such Indemnified Losses
relating back to the first dollar; provided, however, the Indemnification
Threshold limitation shall not apply in any manner whatsoever to the extent
the breach results from fraud, willful misconduct or intentional
misrepresentation.

 

(b) From and after the Closing, Parent shall have no obligation to indemnify
Securityholder Indemnified Persons in respect of Indemnified Losses pursuant
to Section 8.3(a) unless and until such Indemnified Losses exceed the
Indemnification Threshold at which point

 



-88-  the Parent Indemnified Persons shall be entitled to indemnification in
respect of all such Indemnified Losses relating back to the first dollar.

 

(c) From and after the Closing, the aggregate amount of Indemnified Losses
that may be recovered by the Parent Indemnified Persons under Section
8.2(a)(i) shall not exceed $28,500,000 (the " _Cap_ "); provided, however,
that notwithstanding the foregoing, (i) the Cap shall not apply to the
aggregate amount of Indemnified Losses that may be recovered by the Parent
Indemnified Persons for any breach of any representation or warranty made by
the Company in Section 2.14 (Intellectual Property), which shall be subject to
a cap of $38,000,000, (ii) the Cap shall not apply to the aggregate amount of
Indemnified Losses that may be recovered by the Parent Indemnified Persons for
any breach of any representation or warranty made by the Company in Section
2.1 (Organization, Qualification and Power), Section 2.2
(Subsidiaries), Section 2.3 (Capitalization and Related Matters), Section 2.4
(Enforceability; Noncontravention), Section 2.8 (Taxes), and the
representations and warranties of the Securityholders under Section 3.1 (which
are made pursuant to the Side Agreements, Letters of Transmittal and Option
Cancellation Agreements) (collectively, the " _Fundamental Reps_ ") and
intentional misrepresentation, which shall be subject to a cap of the Merger
Consideration, and (iii) the Cap shall not apply in any manner whatsoever to
the extent the breach results from fraud or willful misconduct. The indemnity
payments for breaches of the representations and warranties shall first be
recovered by the Parent Indemnified Persons from any available balance in the
Escrow Account.

(d) From and after the Closing, the aggregate amount of Indemnified Losses
that may be recovered by the Parent Indemnified Persons under Section 8.2(c)
shall not exceed the aggregate amount of Merger Consideration paid or payable
to such Significant Securityholder; provided, however, such limitation shall
not apply in any manner whatsoever to the extent the breach results from
fraud, willful misconduct or intentional misrepresentation.

(e) From and after the Closing, the aggregate amount of Indemnified Losses
that may be recovered by the Securityholder Indemnified Persons under Section
8.3(a) shall not exceed the Cap.

 

(f) The Securityholders shall not have any claim for contribution from or
against the Surviving Company as a result of any indemnification or other
payments made by any of the Securityholders to any of the Parent Indemnified
Persons pursuant to this Agreement.

(g) No information or knowledge acquired, or investigations conducted, by
Parent or its representatives, of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or
otherwise, shall in any way limit, or constitute a waiver of, or a defense to,
any claim for indemnification by Parent or any Parent Indemnified Person
under this Agreement.

(h) The amount of any Losses claimed by any Indemnified Person hereunder shall
be reduced by any Tax benefits (net of Tax costs) when and as actually
recognized in cash (assuming such Tax items are recognized on January 1 of the
year in which such Tax items are taken into account) or savings recognizable
by any Indemnified Person that are attributable to

 



-89-  such Losses. In the event this Section 8.6(h) applies to multiple Tax years,
the Parties shall negotiate in good faith to determine the net Losses payable
in a lump sum.

 

8.7 _Exclusive Remedies_. Anything contained in this Agreement to the contrary
notwithstanding, the indemnification rights set forth in this Article 8, all
of which are subject to the terms, limitations, and restrictions of this
Article 8, shall be the exclusive remedy after Closing for monetary damages
sustained as a result of a breach of a representation or warranty or
covenant under this Agreement, except that the foregoing shall not apply to
fraud, willful misconduct or intentional misrepresentation. In addition, such
limitations set forth in this Article 8 shall not impair the rights of any of
the Parties: (a) to seek non-monetary equitable relief, including (without
limitation) specific performance or injunctive relief to redress any default
or breach of this Agreement, including for the provisions of Article 5 hereof;
or (b) to seek enforcement, collection, damages, or such non-monetary
equitable relief to redress any default or breach of any other agreement to be
delivered at or prior to Closing hereunder. In connection with the seeking of
any non-monetary equitable relief, each of the Parties acknowledges and
agrees that the other Parties hereto would be damaged irreparably in the event
any of the provisions of this Agreement are not performed in accordance with
their specific terms or otherwise are breached. Accordingly, each of the
Parties hereto agrees the other Parties hereto shall be entitled to an
injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of the provisions of this
Agreement and to enforce specifically this Agreement and the terms and
provisions hereof in accordance with Section 10.9 hereof.

Parent (or its Affiliates) incident or relating to the negotiation,
preparation and execution of this Agreement and the transactions contemplated
hereby, and the performance by Parent of its obligations hereunder, including

(b) If a Payment Event occurs pursuant to any of Sections 9.1(iii), 9.1(iv),
or 9.1(v), the Company shall (i) pay Parent (by wire transfer of immediately
available funds) simultaneously with the occurrence of such Payment Event, a
fee equal to $9,500,000 (the " _Termination Fee_ "), and (ii) reimburse Parent
(by wire transfer of immediately available funds), simultaneously with the
occurrence of such Payment Event, for all out-of-pocket costs and expenses
incurred by or on behalf of Parent (or its Affiliates) incident or relating to
the negotiation, preparation and execution of this Agreement, the
Side Agreements, the Letters of Transmittal, and the transactions
contemplated hereby and thereby, and the performance by Parent of its
obligations hereunder, including, without limitation, the fees and expenses of
counsel, accountants, experts, financial advisors and other representatives.

(c) The Company acknowledges that the agreements contained in this Section
10.6 are an integral part of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
and that, without these agreements, Parent and Acquisition Subsidiary would
not enter into this Agreement. Accordingly, if the Company fails promptly to
pay any amount due to Parent pursuant to this Section 10.6, it shall also pay
any costs and expenses (including attorneys fees) incurred by or on behalf of
Parent (or its Affiliates) in connection with a legal action to enforce this
Agreement that results in a judgment against the Company for such amount or
