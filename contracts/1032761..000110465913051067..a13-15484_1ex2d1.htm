conditions set forth in this Agreement, pursuant to which each outstanding

Directors_ ") has unanimously (i) approved this Agreement, the Merger and the

and its stockholders (the " _Company Common Stockholders_ ") and (iii)
resolved to recommend the adoption of this Agreement by the Company Common
Stockholders.

 



 

WHEREAS, concurrently with the execution of this Agreement, and as a condition

of the date hereof, with Parent, pursuant to which, among other things, such
Company Common Stockholders have agreed to vote such Company Common
Stockholders shares of Company Common Stock in favor of the adoption of this
Agreement and against any competing proposals.

      
 

 



 

 **AGREEMENT**

 



 

NOW THEREFORE, in consideration of the representations, warranties, covenants
and agreements contained in this Agreement, the parties hereto hereby agree as
follows:

 



 

 **ARTICLE I**

 

 ** **

 

 **THE MERGER**

 



 

Section 1.1 _The Merger_. Subject to the terms and conditions of this
Agreement, at the Effective Time, the Company and Parent shall consummate the
Merger pursuant to which (i) Merger Sub shall be merged with and into the
Company and the separate corporate existence of Merger Sub shall thereupon
cease, (ii) the Company shall be the successor or surviving corporation in the
Merger and (iii) the separate corporate existence of the Company with all its
rights, privileges, immunities, powers and franchises shall continue
unaffected by the Merger. The Merger shall have the effects set forth in the
DGCL.

 



 

Section 1.2 _Closing_. Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement,
the Closing will take place at 10:00 a.m., local time, at the offices of
Kirkland and Ellis LLP, 300 N. LaSalle Street, Chicago, Illinois 60654, on the
third (3rd) Business Day after the satisfaction or waiver of the conditions
(other than those conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied at the
Closing, but subject to the fulfillment or waiver of those conditions) set
forth in _Article VI_, or another time, date or place as is agreed to in
writing by the parties hereto (the date on which the Closing occurs, the "
_Closing Date_ ").

 



 

Section 1.3 _Effective Time_. On the Closing Date and upon the terms and
subject to the conditions hereof, the Certificate of Merger shall be delivered
for filing with the Delaware Secretary. The Merger shall become effective at
the Effective Time.

 



 

Section 1.4 _Conversion of the Shares_. At the Effective Time, by virtue of
the Merger and without any action on the part of Parent, Merger Sub, the
Company or the holders of any of the following securities:

 



 

(a) Except as provided in _Section 1.4(d)_, each share of Company Common
Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time
(excluding Dissenter Shares) shall be cancelled and shall by virtue of the
Merger and without any action on the part of the holder thereof be converted
automatically into the right to receive $20.00 in cash, without interest
thereon (the " _Merger Consideration_ "), upon surrender of the Certificate
representing such share of Company Common Stock as provided in _Article II_.
All such shares of Company Common Stock, when so converted, shall no longer be
outstanding and shall automatically be cancelled and retired and shall cease
to exist, and each holder of a Certificate theretofore representing such
shares of Company Common Stock shall cease to have any rights with respect
thereto, except the right to receive the Merger Consideration into which such
shares of Company Common Stock have been converted, as provided herein.

 



      
 

 



 

(b) Each share of Company Common Stock that is owned by the Company (or any
Subsidiary of the Company) as treasury stock or otherwise and each share of
Company Common Stock owned by Parent or any of its Affiliates shall be
cancelled and retired and cease to exist and no payment or distribution shall
be made with respect thereto.

 



 

(c) Each share of common stock of Merger Sub issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be converted into and become one
validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable share of common stock, $0.001 par
value per share, of the Surviving Corporation and shall constitute the only
outstanding shares of capital stock of the Surviving Corporation.

 



 

(d) If, between the date hereof and the Effective Time, the outstanding shares
of Company Common Stock shall have been changed into a different number of
shares or a different class, solely by reason of any stock dividend,
subdivision, reclassification, recapitalization, split, reverse split,
combination or exchange of shares or any other similar transaction, the Merger
Consideration shall be correspondingly adjusted to reflect such stock
dividend, subdivision, reclassification, recapitalization, split, reverse
split, combination or exchange of shares or any other similar transaction and
to provide to the holders of Company Common Stock the same economic effect as
contemplated by this Agreement prior to such action.

 



 

Section 1.5 _Organizational Documents_.

 



 

(a) At the Effective Time, the Certificate of Incorporation of the Surviving
Corporation shall be amended and restated in its entirety to be the same as
the Certificate of Incorporation of Merger Sub, as in effect immediately prior
to the Effective Time, except that such Certificate of Incorporation shall (i)
be amended to change the name of the Surviving Corporation to "Keynote
Systems, Inc." and (ii) comply with _Section 5.9(a)_. Thereafter, the
Certificate of Incorporation of the Surviving Corporation may only be amended
in accordance with its terms, _Section 5.9_ and as provided by Law.

 



 

(b) At the Effective Time, the Bylaws of Merger Sub as in effect immediately
prior to the Effective Time shall be the Bylaws of the Surviving Corporation
(except that (i) all references to Merger Sub in the Bylaws of the Surviving
Corporation shall be amended to refer to "Keynote Systems, Inc." and (ii) such
Bylaws shall comply with _Section 5.9(a)_). Thereafter, the Bylaws of the
Surviving Corporation may only be amended or repealed in accordance with their
terms and the Certificate of Incorporation of the Surviving Corporation and as
provided by Law.

 



 

Section 1.6 _Directors and Officers of the Surviving Corporation_. The Company
shall cause to be delivered to Parent, at the Closing, resignations of all the
directors of the Company to be effective upon the Effective Time. At the
Effective Time, the directors of Merger Sub and the officers of the Company
shall continue in office as the directors and officers, respectively, of the
Surviving Corporation, and such directors and officers shall hold office in
accordance with and subject to the Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws of
the Surviving Corporation.

 



      
 

 



 

Section 1.7 _Company Options; Company RSUs; ESPP and Company Restricted
Stock_.

 



 

(a) _Termination of Company Equity Incentive Plan_. Except as otherwise agreed
to by the parties hereto in writing, (i) the Company Equity Incentive Plan
shall terminate as of the Effective Time and the provisions in any other plan,
program or arrangement providing for the issuance or grant of any other
interest in respect of the capital stock of the Company or any Subsidiary
thereof shall be cancelled as of the Effective Time and (ii) the Company shall
ensure that following the Effective Time no participant in the Company Equity
Incentive Plan or other plans, programs or arrangements shall have any right
thereunder to acquire any equity securities of the Company, the Surviving
Corporation or any Subsidiary thereof.

 



 

(b) _Company Common Stock Options_. Immediately prior to, and contingent upon
the consummation of, the Closing, each unvested Company Common Stock Option
shall immediately vest and become exercisable. At the Effective Time, each
outstanding Company Common Stock Option (including those subject to
acceleration pursuant to the immediately preceding sentence), shall be
cancelled, (i) in the case of a Company Common Stock Option having a per share
exercise price less than the Merger Consideration, for the right to receive
from the Surviving Corporation for each share of Company Common Stock subject
to such Company Common Stock Option immediately prior to the Effective Time an
amount (subject to any applicable withholding Tax) in cash (without interest
thereon) equal to the product of (A) the number of shares of Company Common
Stock subject to such Company Common Stock Option immediately prior to the
Effective Time and (B) the amount by which the Merger Consideration exceeds
the per share exercise price of such Company Common Stock Option, and Parent
shall, or shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, pay to the holders of such
Company Stock Options such amount as soon as practicable after the Effective
Time in accordance with _Section 2.1_, or (ii) in the case of any Company
Common Stock Option having a per share exercise price equal to or greater than
the Merger Consideration, without the payment of cash or issuance of other
securities in respect thereof. The cancellation of a Company Common Stock
Option as provided in the immediately preceding sentence shall be deemed a
release of any and all rights the holder thereof had or may have had in
respect of such Company Common Stock Option. Prior to the Effective Time, the
Company shall deliver to the holders of Company Common Stock Options notices,
in form and substance reasonably acceptable to Parent, setting forth such
holders rights pursuant to this Agreement.

 



 

(c) _Company RSUs_. At the Effective Time, each Company RSU, whether vested or
unvested, that has not been settled into shares of Company Common Stock prior
to the Effective Time shall become fully vested and cancelled, for the right
to receive from the Surviving Corporation for each share of Company Common
Stock subject to such Company RSU immediately prior to the Effective Time an
amount (subject to any applicable withholding Tax) in cash (without interest
thereon) equal to the product of (i) the number of shares of Company Common
Stock subject to such Company RSU immediately prior to the Effective Time
without regard to vesting and (ii) the Merger Consideration to each share, and
Parent shall, or shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, pay to the holders
of such Company RSUs such amount as soon as practicable after the Effective
Time in accordance with _Section 2.1_. The cancellation of a Company RSU as
provided in the immediately preceding sentence shall be deemed a release of
any and all rights the holder thereof had or may have had in respect of such
Company RSU. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall deliver to the
holders of Company RSUs notices, in form and substance reasonably acceptable
to Parent, setting forth such holders rights pursuant to this Agreement.

 



      
 

 



 

(d) _Company Restricted Stock_. At the Effective Time, each share of Company
Restricted Stock, whether vested or unvested, that is outstanding immediately
prior thereto shall become fully vested and all restrictions and repurchase
rights thereon shall lapse and all such shares of Company Restricted Stock
shall be converted automatically into the right to receive at the Effective
Time an amount in cash (without interest thereon) in U.S. dollars equal to the
product of (i) the total number of such shares of Company Restricted Stock
without regard to vesting and (ii) the Merger Consideration.

 



 

(e) _Employee Stock Purchase Plan_. As soon as practicable following the date
hereof, the Company Board of Directors (or, if appropriate, any committee
administering the ESPP) shall adopt such resolutions or take such other
actions as may be required to provide that, with respect to the ESPP: (i) each
individual participating in the Offering (as defined in the ESPP) in progress
as of the date hereof (the " _Final Offering_ ") shall not be permitted (x) to
increase the amount of his or her rate of payroll contributions thereunder
from the rate in effect when the Final Offering commenced or (y) to make
separate non-payroll contributions to the ESPP on or following the date
hereof, (ii) no individual who is not participating in the ESPP as of the date
hereof may commence participation in the ESPP following the date hereof, (iii)
the Final Offering shall end on (and the final Purchase Date (as defined in
the ESPP) shall be) the earlier to occur of July 31, 2013 and a date that is
five (5) calendar days prior to the Effective Time, (iv) each ESPP
participants accumulated contributions under the ESPP shall be used to
purchase shares of Company Common Stock in accordance with the terms of the
ESPP as of the end of the Final Offering, (v) the ESPP shall terminate the
date immediately prior to the date of the Effective Time and no further rights
shall be granted or exercised under the ESPP thereafter and (vi) no new
Offering Periods (as defined in the ESPP) shall be commenced after the date
hereof. _Section 1.7(e)_ of the Company Disclosure Letter sets forth: (A) the
aggregate number of shares of Company Common Stock to be purchased under the
ESPP, and (B) the aggregate purchase price for such shares under the ESPP (in
each case assuming for this purpose that the Merger Consideration is the Fair
Market Value (as defined in the ESPP) of Company Common Stock on the Purchase
Date (as defined in the ESPP) and the Purchase Date is the date prior to the
date of this Agreement), as determined in accordance with the immediately
preceding sentence. All shares of Company Common Stock purchased in the Final
Offering shall be cancelled at the Effective Time and converted into the right
to receive the Merger Consideration in accordance with the terms and
conditions of this Agreement.

 



      
 

 



 

Section 1.8 _Dissenter Shares_. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to
the contrary, if any Dissenting Stockholder shall demand to be paid the "fair
value" of its Dissenter Shares, as provided in Section 262 of the DGCL, such
Dissenter Shares shall not be converted into or exchangeable for the right to
receive the Merger Consideration (except as provided in this _Section 1.8_)
and shall entitle such Dissenting Stockholder only to payment of the fair
value of such Dissenter Shares, in accordance with Section 262 of the DGCL,
unless and until such Dissenting Stockholder withdraws (in accordance with
Section 262 of the DGCL) or effectively loses the right to dissent. The

Section 2.1 _Paying Agent_. At the Closing, Parent shall deposit, or shall
cause to be deposited, with a bank or trust company designated by Parent and
reasonably satisfactory to the Company (the " _Paying Agent_ "), for the
benefit of the holders of shares of Company Common Stock, for exchange in
accordance with this _Article II_, through the Paying Agent, cash in U.S.
dollars in an amount sufficient to pay the aggregate amount of the Merger
Consideration (such cash being hereinafter referred to as the " _Exchange
Fund_ ") payable pursuant to _Article I_ in exchange for outstanding shares
of Company Common Stock (but not, for the avoidance of doubt, for payments in
respect of Company Common Stock Options, Company RSUs or Company Restricted
Stock, which shall be paid by the Company through its payroll system as soon
as practicable (and in any case no later than the second payroll date)
following the Closing unless otherwise agreed to by Parent). The Paying Agent

_Article I_ in exchange for outstanding shares of Company Common Stock out of
the Exchange Fund. The Exchange Fund shall be invested by the Paying Agent as
directed by Parent; _provided_ that: (i) no such investment or losses thereon

Service, Inc. or Standard and Poors Corporation, respectively, or in
certificates of deposit, bank repurchase agreements or bankers acceptances of
commercial banks with capital exceeding $1 billion (based on the most recent
financial statements of such bank that are then publicly available). Any net
profit resulting from, or interest or income produced by, such investments
shall be payable to the Surviving Corporation or Parent, and any amounts in
excess of the amounts payable pursuant to _Article I_ shall be promptly
returned to the Surviving Corporation or Parent, in each case as directed by
Parent. The Exchange Fund shall not be used for any other purpose.

 



       
 

 



 

Section 2.2 _Exchange Procedures_. Promptly following the Effective Time (but
in no event later than three (3) Business Days following the Effective Time),
Parent shall instruct the Paying Agent to mail to each holder of record of a
certificate or certificates that immediately prior to the Effective Time
represented outstanding shares of Company Common Stock (" _Certificates_ ," it
being understood that any references herein to " _Certificates_ " shall be
deemed to include references to book-entry account statements relating to the
ownership of shares of Company Common Stock) and whose shares of Company
Common Stock have been converted into the right to receive Merger
Consideration pursuant to _Article I_ (excluding, for the avoidance of doubt,
the Company, Parent, Merger Sub, any Subsidiary of the Company or Parent or
holders of Dissenter Shares who have not subsequently withdrawn or lost their
rights of appraisal) (i) a letter of transmittal in customary form and with
such other provisions as Parent may reasonably determine (which shall specify
that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the
Certificates shall pass, only upon proper delivery of Certificates to the
Paying Agent) and (ii) instructions for use in effecting the surrender of
Certificates in exchange for the Merger Consideration. Upon surrender of a
Certificate for cancellation to the Paying Agent together with such letter of
transmittal, properly completed and duly executed, and such other documents as
may be reasonably required pursuant to such instructions (or, if such shares
are held in book-entry or other uncertificated form, upon the entry through a
book-entry transfer agent of the surrender of such shares on a book-entry
account statement), the holder of such Certificate shall be entitled to
receive in exchange therefor the Merger Consideration that such holder has the
right to receive in respect of the shares of Company Common Stock formerly
represented by such Certificate, and the Certificate so surrendered shall
forthwith be cancelled. No interest will be paid or accrued on any Merger
Consideration payable to holders of Certificates. In the event of a transfer
of ownership of shares of Company Common Stock that is not registered in the
transfer records of the Company, the Merger Consideration may be issued to a
transferee if the Certificate representing such shares of Company Common Stock
is presented to the Paying Agent, accompanied by all documents required to
evidence and effect such transfer and by evidence that any applicable stock
transfer Taxes have been paid. Until surrendered as contemplated by this
_Article II_, each Certificate shall be deemed at any time after the
Effective Time to represent only the right to receive upon such surrender the
Merger Consideration or the right to demand to be paid the "fair value" of the
shares represented thereby as contemplated by _Section 1.8_.

 



 

Section 2.3 _Further Rights in Company Common Stock_. All Merger Consideration
paid in accordance with the terms hereof shall be deemed to have been issued
in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to the shares of Company Common
Stock in respect of which such Merger Consideration was paid.

 



 

Section 2.4 _Termination of Exchange Fund_. Any portion of the Exchange Fund
that remains undistributed to the holders of Company Common Stock for nine (9)
months after the Effective Time shall be delivered to the Surviving
Corporation upon demand, and any Company Common Stockholders who have not
theretofore complied with this _Article II_ shall thereafter look only to the
Surviving Corporation for the Merger Consideration, without any interest
thereon.

 



      
 

 



 

Section 2.5 _No Liability_. None of Parent, the Company or the Surviving
Corporation shall be liable to any Company Common Stockholder for any cash
from the Exchange Fund delivered to a public official pursuant to any
abandoned property, escheat or similar Law.

 



 

Section 2.6 _Lost Certificates_. If any Certificate shall have been lost,
stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the
Person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if
required by Parent, the posting by such Person of a bond, in such reasonable
and customary amount as Parent may direct, as indemnity against any claim that
may be made against it with respect to such lost, stolen or destroyed
Certificate, the Paying Agent will issue in exchange for such lost, stolen or
destroyed Certificate the Merger Consideration without any interest thereon.

 



 

Section 2.7 _No Further Dividends_. No dividends or other distributions with
respect to capital stock of the Surviving Corporation with a record date on or
after the Effective Time shall be paid to the holder of any unsurrendered
Certificates.

 



 

Section 2.8 _Withholding of Tax_. Parent, the Surviving Corporation, any
Affiliate thereof or the Paying Agent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold
from the consideration otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement to any
holder of shares of Company Common Stock, Company Common Stock Options,
Company RSUs and/or Company Restricted Stock such amount as Parent, the
Surviving Corporation, any Affiliate thereof or the Paying Agent is required
to deduct and withhold with respect to the making of such payment under the
Code or any provision of state, local or foreign Tax Law. To the extent that
amounts are so withheld by the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent, such
withheld amounts shall be (i) paid over to the applicable Governmental Entity
in accordance with applicable Law or Order and (ii) treated for all purposes
of this Agreement as having been paid to the former holder of a Certificate,
Company Common Stock Option or Company RSU in respect of which such deduction
and withholding was made.

any Third Party, any rights or immunities under, any Company Intellectual
Property or any other license requiring the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
to disclose source code to any of the Company Products, grant rights to
redistribute the Company Products, grant patent non-asserts or patent
licenses, or otherwise grant any rights no specifically granted in the

any of its Subsidiaries or any person acting on their behalf. To the Knowledge
of the Company, there has been no unauthorized theft or disclosure of any
Source Code of a Company Product.

(b) Except as expressly set forth in the Financing Commitments, there are no
conditions precedent to the obligations of the Lender or the Sponsor to
provide the Financing or any contingencies that would permit the Lender or the
Sponsor to reduce the total amount of the Financing. Assuming the satisfaction
of the conditions set forth _Sections 6.1_ and _6.2_ and the performance by
the Company of its obligations under this Agreement, Parent does not have any
reason to believe that it will be unable to satisfy fully and unconditionally
on a timely basis all conditions and terms to be satisfied by it in any of the
Financing Commitments on or prior to the Closing Date, nor does Parent have
knowledge that the Lender or the Sponsor will not perform any of its
respective obligations thereunder.

 



      
 

 



 

(c) The Financing Commitments are in full force and effect as of the date
hereof and are the legal, valid and binding obligations of Parent and Merger
Sub and, to the knowledge of Parent, of the other parties thereto, in
accordance with the terms and conditions thereof, subject to the Bankruptcy
and Equity Exception. No event has occurred that, with or without notice,
lapse of time, or both, would reasonably be expected to constitute a default
or breach or a failure to satisfy a condition precedent on the part of Parent
or, to the knowledge of Parent, any other party to the Financing Commitments,
under any of the Financing Commitments. Parent shall have paid in full any and
all commitment fees and other fees required to be paid pursuant to the terms
of the Financing Commitments as and when due. Neither Financing Commitment has
been modified, amended or altered as of the date hereof, neither Financing
Commitment will be amended, modified or altered at any time through the
Closing, except as permitted by _Section 4.5(d)_, none of the respective
commitments under any Financing Commitment have been withdrawn or rescinded in
any respect and neither the Lender nor the Sponsor has threatened to withdraw
or rescind any of the Equity Financing or the Debt Financing, respectively.

 



 

(d) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, all or a
portion of the Debt Financing Commitment may, in accordance with the
provisions of this Agreement, be superseded at the option of Parent after the
date hereof but prior to the Effective Time by instruments (the " _Alternative
Financing Commitments_ ") replacing the existing Debt Financing Commitment;
_provided_ that any Alternative Financing Commitment shall comply with all
limitations on amendments, modifications and replacements of the Debt
Financing Commitment set forth in the first sentence of _Section 5.12(c)_ and
shall not contain conditions to the receipt of such Debt Financing that are
materially less favorable, in the aggregate, to Parent (as determined in the
reasonable judgment of Parent) than the terms of the Debt Financing Commitment
such Alternative Financing Commitment is replacing. In the event all or a
portion of the Debt Financing Commitment is superseded after the date hereof,
(x) the term " _Financing Commitments_ " as used herein shall be deemed to
include the Financing Commitments that are not so superseded at the time in
question and the Alternative Financing Commitments to the extent then in
effect, and (y) the term " _Debt Financing_ " as used herein shall mean the
debt financing contemplated by the Financing Commitments as modified pursuant
to the foregoing clause (x).

 



 

(e) Assuming the Financing Commitments are funded, Parent and Merger Sub will
have at and after the Closing funds (after netting out applicable, fees,
expenses, original issue discount and similar premiums and charges and after
giving effect to the maximum amount of flex (including original issue discount
flex) provided under the Debt Financing Commitment and the Fee Letter)
sufficient to pay all of the amounts payable under _Article I_ or otherwise
in connection with the Merger and fees and expenses associated with the
consummation of the Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby.

 



 

(f) Parents obligation to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby is
not contingent on Parents ability to obtain the Financing prior to
consummating the Merger.

 



       
 

 



 

Section 4.6 _Limited Guarantee_. Parent has provided to the Company a true and
complete copy of the Limited Guarantee. The Limited Guarantee is in full force
and effect as of the date hereof and constitutes a valid and binding
obligation of the Sponsor enforceable against the Sponsor in accordance with
its terms, subject the Bankruptcy and Equity Exception. No event has occurred
that, with or without notice, lapse of time or both, would or would reasonably
be expected to constitute a default or breach on the part of the Sponsor under
the Limited Guarantee.

 



 

Section 4.7 _Brokers_. No broker, finder or investment banker is entitled to
any brokerage, finders or other fee or commission in connection with this
Agreement, the Merger or the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement
based upon arrangements made by or on behalf of Parent or Merger Sub or any of
their respective directors, officers or employees, for which the Company may
become liable.

 



 

Section 4.8 _Merger Sub_. As of the date hereof, the authorized capital stock
of Merger Sub consists of 1,000 shares of common stock, par value $0.001 per
share, all of which shares are validly issued and outstanding. All of the
issued and outstanding capital stock of Merger Sub is, and at the Effective
Time will be, owned by Parent. Merger Sub was formed solely for the purpose of
engaging in the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and, prior to the
Effective Time, Merger Sub will have engaged in no business and have no
Liabilities or obligations other than in connection with the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement.

 



 

Section 4.9 _Solvency_. As of the Effective Time and immediately after giving
effect to all of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including
the Merger, the Financing and all payments contemplated by this Agreement in
connection with the Merger (including payment of all amounts payable under
_Article I_ in connection with or as a result of the Merger) and payment of
all related fees and expenses of Parent, Merger Sub, the Company and their
respective Subsidiaries in connection therewith, and assuming the accuracy as
of the Effective Time in all material respects of those representations and
warranties of the Company set forth in _Article III_ that relate to the
subject matter of clauses (i) through (iii) of this _Section 4.9_ (including
_Section 3.8_): (i) the amount of the "fair saleable value" of the assets of
each of the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, will
exceed (A) the value of all Liabilities of the Surviving Corporation and such
Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, including contingent and other Liabilities
(whether or not reflected in a balance sheet prepared in accordance with
GAAP), and (B) the amount that will be required to pay the probable
Liabilities of the Surviving Corporation and such Subsidiaries on their
existing debts as such debts become absolute and matured, (ii) each of the
Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries will not have an unreasonably small
amount of capital for the operation of the businesses in which it is engaged
or proposed to be engaged and (iii) each of the Surviving Corporation and its
Subsidiaries will be able to pay its Liabilities, including contingent and
other Liabilities, as they mature. For purposes of the foregoing, "not have an
unreasonably small amount of capital for the operation of the businesses in
which it is engaged or proposed to be engaged" and "able to pay its
liabilities, including contingent and other liabilities, as they mature" means
that such Person will be able to generate enough cash from operations, asset
dispositions or refinancing, or a combination thereof, to meet its obligations
as they become due.

or to be supplied, by or on behalf of Parent or Merger Sub for inclusion in
the Proxy Statement or any other documents to be filed by Parent, Merger Sub
or the Company with the SEC or any other Governmental Entity in connection
with the Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby, will, on the
date of its filing or, in the case of the Proxy Statement, at the date it is
mailed to Company Common Stockholders and at the time of the Stockholders
Meeting, contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any
material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the
statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made,
not misleading. If at any time prior to the Effective Time any event with
respect to Parent or Merger Sub shall occur that is required to be described
in the Proxy Statement, Parent shall promptly disclose such event to the
Company. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Parent makes no representation or
warranty with respect to any information supplied by the Company that is
contained in any of the foregoing documents.

 



 

Section 4.11 _Stockholder, Labor and Employee Matters_. Other than the Voting
Agreements, neither Parent nor Merger Sub has: (i) entered into any employment
agreement, or made or entered into any formal or informal arrangements or

stockholders, directors, officers or employees, or any other Contract with
such Persons relating to this Agreement, the Merger or any of the other
transactions contemplated hereby, (ii) offered employment to any of the
Companys stockholders, directors, officers or employees, (iii) had
discussions with any of the Companys stockholders, directors, officers or
employees regarding the future terms of their employment after the Closing or
(iv) sold, or offered to sell, any direct or indirect equity interest in the
Company to any of the Companys stockholders, directors, officers or

their respective Subsidiaries or Affiliates "owns" (as defined in Section 203
of the DGCL), directly or indirectly (including pursuant to a derivatives
contract), any shares of Company Common Stock or other securities convertible

(b) Without limiting the foregoing, (i) each of the Company, Parent and Merger
Sub shall use its reasonable best efforts to make promptly (and in any event

required to be or should be obtained from other parties to loan agreements or
other Contracts material to the Companys business in connection with the

Affiliates freedom of action with respect to, or ability to retain, any of
their businesses, product lines or assets, or otherwise limit Parents or its
Affiliates ability to receive the full benefits of this Agreement. In no
event shall Parent or Merger Sub be required to (nor will the Company, without
Parents consent, which may be withheld at Parents sole discretion) pay any
fee, penalty or other consideration to any third party for any consent or
approval required for the consummation of the transaction contemplated by this

case may be, and otherwise take such other commercially reasonable and lawful
actions to eliminate or minimize the effects of such statute, and any
regulations promulgated thereunder, on such transactions.

 



 

Section 5.4 _Proxy_.

 



 

(a) _Proxy Statement_. As promptly as practicable after the date hereof, the
Company shall prepare the Proxy Statement and the Company shall cause the

Advisor will receive upon consummation of the Merger, and the conditions for
the payment of such fees and other considerations), the opinion referred to in
_Section 3.19_ and the basis for rendering such opinion.

 



 

(b) _SEC Comments_. The Company, after consultation with Parent, will use its
reasonable best efforts to respond as promptly as practicable to any comments
made by the SEC with respect to the Proxy Statement. The Company will advise
Parent, promptly after it receives notice thereof, of any request by the SEC
for amendment of the Proxy Statement or comments thereon and responses thereto
or requests by the SEC for additional information and will promptly supply
Parent with copies of all correspondence between the Company or any of the
Company Representatives, on the one hand, and the SEC or its staff, on the
other hand, with respect to the Proxy Statement or the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement. Prior to filing or mailing the Proxy Statement
or filing any other required filings (or, in each case, any amendment or
supplement thereto) or responding to any comments of the SEC with respect
thereto, the Company shall provide Parent with an opportunity to review and
comment on such document or response and shall include in such document or
response comments reasonably proposed by Parent. As promptly as practicable
after the clearance (which shall include upon expiration of the ten- (10) day
period after filing in the event the SEC does not review the Proxy Statement)
of the Proxy Statement by the SEC (the " _SEC Clearance Date_ "), the Company
shall mail the Proxy Statement and all other proxy materials to the holders of
shares of Company Common Stock and, if necessary in order to comply with
applicable securities Law, after the Proxy Statement shall have been so
mailed, promptly circulate amended, supplemental or supplemented proxy
material, and, if required in connection therewith, re-solicit proxies.

 



      
 

 



 

(c) _Information Supplied_. Each of Parent and the Company agrees, as to it
and its Affiliates and Representatives, that none of the information supplied
or to be supplied by Parent or the Company, as applicable, expressly for
inclusion or incorporation by reference in the Proxy Statement or any other
documents filed or to be filed with the SEC in connection with the
transactions contemplated hereby, will, as of the time such documents (or any
amendment thereof or supplement thereto) are mailed to the holders of shares
of Company Common Stock and at the time of the Stockholders Meeting, contain
any untrue statement of a material fact, or omit to state any material fact
required to be stated therein in order to make the statements therein, in
light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading. Each of
Parent, Merger Sub and the Company further agrees that all documents that such
party is responsible for filing with the SEC in connection with the Merger
will comply as to form and substance in all material respects with the
applicable requirements of the Securities Act, the Exchange Act and any other
applicable Law and will not contain any untrue statement of a material fact,
or omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein in order to
make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they
were made, not misleading. If at any time prior to the Effective Time, any
event or circumstance relating to Parent or Merger Sub, or their respective
officers or directors, should be discovered by Parent that should be set forth
in an amendment or a supplement to the Proxy Statement, Parent shall promptly
inform the Company and, if requested by Parent, the Company shall amend or
supplement the Proxy Statement promptly to disclose such event or
circumstance. If at any time prior to the Effective Time, any event or
circumstance relating to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, or their
respective officers or directors, should be discovered by the Company that
should be set forth in an amendment or a supplement to the Proxy Statement,
the Company shall promptly inform Parent and, if requested by Parent, the
Company shall amend or supplement the Proxy Statement promptly to disclose
such event or circumstance.

 



       
 

 



 

Section 5.5 _Stockholders Meeting_.

 



 

(a) The Company shall duly call, give notice of and hold the Stockholders
Meeting as promptly as practicable following the date on which the Proxy
Statement is mailed to the Company Common Stockholders; _provided_ that,
without the prior written consent of Parent, (i) the Stockholders Meeting
shall not be held later than thirty (30) calendar days after the SEC Clearance
Date and (ii) the Company may not adjourn or postpone the Stockholders
Meeting; _provided_ that nothing herein shall prevent the Company from
postponing or adjourning the Stockholders Meeting (x) if there are holders of
insufficient shares of the Company Common Stock present or represented by a
proxy at the Stockholders Meeting to constitute a quorum at the Stockholders
Meeting, (y) if the Company is required to postpone or adjourn the
Stockholders Meeting by an Order or a request from the SEC or its staff or (z)
to the extent necessary to ensure that any supplement or amendment to the
Proxy Statement that is required by applicable Law is timely provided to the
holders of the Company Common Stock prior to the vote at the Stockholders
Meeting.

 



 

(b) The Company shall establish a record date for purposes of determining
Company Common Stockholders entitled to notice of and vote at the Stockholders
Meeting (the " _Record Date_ "). Once the Company has established the Record
Date, the Company shall not change such Record Date or establish a different
record date for the Stockholders Meeting without the prior written consent of
Parent. In the event that the date of the Stockholders Meeting as originally
called is for any reason adjourned or postponed or otherwise delayed, the
Company agrees that unless Parent shall have otherwise approved in writing
(such approval not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed), it
shall implement such adjournment or postponement or other delay in such a way
that the Company does not establish a new Record Date for the Stockholders
Meeting, as so adjourned, postponed or delayed, except as required by
applicable Law.

 



 

(c) Subject to _Section 5.6_, at the Stockholders Meeting, the Company Board
of Directors shall make the Company Recommendation and, unless there has been
a Company Adverse Recommendation Change, the Company shall take all reasonable
lawful action to solicit the Company Required Vote. Notwithstanding any
Company Adverse Recommendation Change, unless this Agreement is validly
terminated pursuant to, and in accordance with _Article VII_, this Agreement
shall be submitted to the Company Common Stockholders for the purpose of
obtaining the Company Required Vote. The Company shall, upon the reasonable
request of Parent, advise Parent at least on a daily basis on each of the last
ten (10) Business Days prior to the date of the Stockholders Meeting, as to
the aggregate tally of the proxies received by the Company with respect to the
Company Required Vote. Without the prior written consent of Parent, the
adoption of this Agreement shall be the only matter (other than procedural
matters) that the Company shall propose to be acted on by the Company Common
Stockholders at the Stockholders Meeting.

 



      
 

 



 

Section 5.6 _No Solicitation of Transactions_.

 



 

(a) Within one (1) Business Day following the date hereof, the Company will
instruct and cause its Subsidiaries and its and their respective
Representatives to immediately cease all discussions and negotiations with any
Persons that may be ongoing with respect to an Acquisition Proposal, and
deliver a written notice to each such Person to the effect that the Company is
ending all discussions and negotiations with such Person with respect to any
Acquisition Proposal and such notice shall also request such Person to
promptly return or destroy all confidential information concerning the Company
and its Subsidiaries made available to such Person in connection with a
potential Acquisition Proposal. From the date hereof until the earlier of the
Effective Time or the termination of this Agreement, the Company will not and
will not authorize or permit any Subsidiary, or Representative to, directly or
indirectly:

 



 

(A) initiate, solicit, propose, knowingly encourage (including by providing
information) or take any action to knowingly facilitate any inquiries or the
making of any proposal or offer that constitutes, or would reasonably be
expected to lead to, an Acquisition Proposal;

 



 

(B) engage in, continue or otherwise participate in any discussions (other
than to refer to this Agreement) or negotiations regarding, or provide any
information or data concerning the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to any
Person relating to, any Acquisition Proposal or any proposal or offer that
would reasonably be expected to lead to an Acquisition Proposal;

 



 

(C) grant any waiver, amendment or release under any standstill or
confidentiality agreement or Section 203 of the DGCL ( _provided_ that the
Company shall not be required to enforce, and shall be permitted to waive, any
provision that prohibits or purports to prohibit a confidential proposal being
made to the Company Board of Directors (directly or indirectly through the
Companys Representatives) or would restrict the Companys rights under this
Agreement);

 



 

(D) approve, endorse, recommend or execute or enter into any letter of intent,
agreement in principle, merger agreement, acquisition agreement or other
similar agreement (which, for the avoidance of doubt, excludes any Acceptable
Confidentiality Agreement) relating to an Acquisition Proposal or any proposal
or offer that would reasonably be expected to lead to an Acquisition Proposal,
or that contradicts this Agreement or requires the Company to abandon this
Agreement; or

 



 

(E) resolve, propose or agree to do any of the foregoing.

 



 

(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in _Section 5.6(a)_,
at any time prior to, but not after, obtaining the Company Required Vote, the
Company may:

 



 

(i) provide information in response to a request therefor to a Third Party who
has made a _bona fide_ written Acquisition Proposal after the date hereof that
was not solicited in material violation of this _Section 5.6_ if and only if,
prior to providing such information, the Company has received from such Third
Party so requesting such information an executed Acceptable Confidentiality
Agreement; _provided_ that the Company shall promptly (and in any event within
24 hours) make available to Parent any material information concerning the
Company and its Subsidiaries that is provided to such Third Party making such
Acquisition Proposal that is given such access and that was not previously
made available to Parent or the Parent Representatives; or

 



      
 

 



 

(ii) engage or participate in any discussions or negotiations with an Third
Party who has made such an unsolicited _bona fide_ written Acquisition
Proposal;

 



 

 _provided_ that, prior to taking any action described in _Section 5.6(b)(i)_
or _Section 5.6(b)(ii)_, (A) the Company Board of Directors shall have
determined in good faith, after consultation with outside legal counsel, that
failure to take such action would be inconsistent with the directors
fiduciary duties under applicable Law, and (B) the Company Board of Directors
shall have determined in good faith, based on the information then available
and after consultation with its independent financial advisor and outside
legal counsel, that such Acquisition Proposal either constitutes a Superior
Proposal or would reasonably be expected to result in a Superior Proposal;
_provided_ , _further_ , that the Company and its Representatives may contact
such Third Party to clarify the terms and conditions of such Acquisition
Proposal prior to making any such determinations.

 



 

(c) Except as expressly provided by _Section 5.6(d)_, _Section 5.6(e)_ or
_Section 5.6(f)_, at any time after the date hereof, neither the Company
Board of Directors nor any committee thereof nor any of the directors, whether
acting in their individual capacity or as a director, shall:

 



 

(i) (A) withhold, withdraw, qualify or modify (or publicly propose or resolve
to withhold, withdraw, qualify or modify), in a manner adverse to Parent or
the Merger Sub, the Company Recommendation with respect to the Merger, (B)
adopt, approve or recommend to the Company Common Stockholders or propose to
adopt, approve or recommend to the Company Common Stockholders an Acquisition
Proposal, (C) fail to make a Required Reaffirmation within five (5) Business
Days after Parent so requests in writing; provided that such failure shall not
be a Company Adverse Recommendation Change if the Company shall have
previously made a Required Reaffirmation on two (2) or more occasions or
within the thirty (30) days immediately preceding such request; _provided_ ,
_further_ , that such failure shall not be a Company Adverse Recommendation
Change if there shall not have been, at the time of such request, a publicly
announced Acquisition Proposal that has not been withdrawn or substantial
market rumors with respect to a potential Acquisition Proposal, (D) fail to
recommend against any Acquisition Proposal subject to Regulation 14D under the
Exchange Act in a Solicitation/Recommendation Statement on Schedule 14D-9
within ten (10) Business Days after the commencement of such Acquisition
Proposal or (E) fail to include the Company Recommendation in the Proxy
Statement (any action described in clauses (A) through (E), a " _Company
Adverse Recommendation Change_ "); or

 



      
 

 



 

(ii) cause or permit the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to enter into any
Acquisition Agreement relating to any Acquisition Proposal.

 



 

(d) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement, at
any time prior to obtaining the Company Required Vote, if the Company has
received a _bona fide_ written Acquisition Proposal from any Person that is
not withdrawn and that the Company Board of Directors concludes in good faith
constitutes a Superior Proposal, then (x) the Company Board of Directors may
effect a Company Adverse Recommendation Change with respect to such Superior
Proposal, or (y) the Company Board of Directors may authorize the Company to
terminate this Agreement to enter into an Alternative Acquisition Agreement
with respect to such Superior Proposal, if and only if:

 



 

(i) the Company Board of Directors determines in good faith, after
consultation with its independent financial advisor and outside legal counsel,
that failure to do so would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under
applicable Law;

 



 

(ii) the Company shall have complied in all material respects with its
obligations under this _Section 5.6_ with respect to such Acquisition
Proposal;

 



 

(iii) the Company shall have provided prior written notice to Parent at least
four (4) Business Days in advance (the " _Notice Period_ "), to the effect
that the Company Board of Directors has received a _bona fide_ written
Acquisition Proposal that is not withdrawn and that the Company Board of
Directors concludes in good faith constitutes a Superior Proposal and, absent
any revision to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, the Company Board
of Directors has resolved to effect a Company Adverse Recommendation Change
and/or to terminate this Agreement pursuant to _Section 7.1(d)_, which notice
shall specify the basis for such Company Adverse Recommendation Change and/or
termination, including the identity of the party making the Superior Proposal
and the material terms thereof; and

 



 

(A) prior to effecting such Company Adverse Recommendation Change or
termination, the Company shall, and shall cause their financial and legal
advisors to, during the Notice Period, negotiate with Parent and the Parent
Representatives in good faith (to the extent Parent desires to negotiate) to
make such adjustments in the terms and conditions of this Agreement, so that
such Acquisition Proposal would cease to constitute a Superior Proposal;
_provided_ that in the event of any material revisions to the Acquisition
Proposal that the Company Board of Directors has determined to be a Superior
Proposal, the Company shall be required to deliver a new written notice to
Parent and to comply with the requirements of this _Section 5.6_ (including
this _Section 5.6(d)_) with respect to such new written notice; _provided_ ,
_further_ , that the Notice Period with respect to such new written notice
shall expire upon the end of the second (2nd) Business Day after the delivery
of such new written notice; and

 



      
 

 



 

(B) any such termination shall be in accordance with _Section 7.1(e)_,
including the payment of the Company Termination Fee in accordance with
_Section 7.2(b)_.

 



 

(e) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement, at
any time prior to obtaining the Company Required Vote, the Company Board of
Directors may, in response to a material development or change in material
circumstances not relating to any Acquisition Proposal, which development or
change first occurred or arose after the date hereof and the existence and
material consequences of which development or change were not known by the
Company Board of Directors at or prior to the date hereof (such material
development or change in circumstances, an " _Intervening Event_ "), make a
Company Adverse Recommendation Change if the Company Board of Directors
determines in good faith, after consultation with its financial advisor and
outside legal counsel, that, in light of such Intervening Event, the failure
of the Company Board of Directors to effect such a Company Adverse
Recommendation Change would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under
applicable Law; _provided_ that the Company Board of Directors shall not be
entitled to exercise its right to make a Company Adverse Recommendation Change
pursuant to this _Section 5.6(e)_ unless the Company has (i) provided to
Parent at least four (4) Business Days prior written notice (unless the
Intervening Event arises fewer than four (4) Business Days prior to the
Stockholders Meeting, in which case such notice shall be given as promptly as
practicable prior to the Stockholders Meeting), which notice shall set forth
in reasonable detail the basis for such Company Adverse Recommendation Change,
and (ii) during such four (4) Business Day period, if requested by Parent,
engaged in good faith negotiations with Parent to make such adjustments in the
terms and conditions of this Agreement in such a manner that obviates the need
for a Company Adverse Recommendation Change as a result of such Intervening
Event.

 



 

(f) Nothing contained in this _Section 5.6_ shall be deemed to prohibit the
Company or the Company Board of Directors from (i) complying with its
disclosure obligations under U.S. federal or state Law with regard to an
Acquisition Proposal or this Agreement, including taking and disclosing to its
stockholders a position contemplated by Rule 14d-9 or Rule 14e-2(a) under the
Exchange Act (or any similar communication to Company Common Stockholders),
_provided_ that the Company shall not effect or disclose pursuant to such
rules or otherwise a position that constitutes a Company Adverse
Recommendation Change unless otherwise specifically permitted by this _Section
5.6_, or (ii) making any "stop-look-and-listen" communication or similar
communication of the type contemplated by Rule 14d-9(f) under the Exchange
Act.

 



 

(g) The Company agrees that it will promptly (and, in any event, within 24
hours) notify Parent if any proposals or offers with respect to an Acquisition
Proposal are received by, or any non-public information is requested from, or
any discussions or negotiations are sought to be initiated or continued with,
the Company or any of its Representatives from or by, respectively, any Third
Party indicating, in connection with such notice, the identity of the Person
or group of Persons making such offer or proposal, and the material terms and
conditions of any proposals or offers (including, if applicable, copies of any
written requests, proposals or offers, including proposed agreements) and
thereafter shall keep Parent reasonably informed, on a prompt basis, of the
status and terms of any such proposals or offers (including any amendments
thereto) and any material change in the status of any such discussions or
negotiations.

 



      
 

 



 

(h) The Company agrees that in the event any of its Representatives takes any
action that, if taken by the Company, would constitute a breach of this
_Section 5.6_, then the Company shall be deemed to be in breach of this
_Section 5.6_.

 



 

Section 5.7 _Public Announcements_. The initial press release relating to this
Agreement shall be a joint press release issued by the Company and Parent, and
thereafter the Company and Parent shall consult with each other before issuing
any press release or otherwise making any public statements with respect to
this Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated by the Transaction
Documents and shall not issue any such press release or make any such public
statement without the prior consent of the other parties hereto, which consent
shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed; _provided_ that a party hereto
may, without the prior consent of the other parties hereto, issue such press
release or make such public statement as may be required by Law or Order or
the applicable rules of the Nasdaq if it has used its commercially reasonable
efforts to consult with the other parties hereto and to obtain such partys
consent but has been unable to do so prior to the time such press release or
public statement is so required to be issued or made.

 



 

Section 5.8 _Litigation_. Without limiting the obligations of the parties
hereto in _Section 5.3_, each of Parent, Merger Sub and the Company agrees to
use its commercially reasonable efforts to defend any lawsuits or other legal
proceedings, whether judicial or administrative, challenging, or seeking
damages or other relief as a result of, the Merger, this Agreement or the
transactions contemplated by the Transaction Documents, including seeking to
have any Order adversely affecting the ability of the parties hereto to
consummate the transactions contemplated by the Transaction Documents entered
by any court or other Governmental Entity promptly vacated or reversed;
_provided_ that, without limiting _Section 5.1(b)(xxv)_, the Company shall
give Parent the right to review and comment on all material filings or
responses to be made by the Company in connection with any Merger Litigation,
and the right to consult on the settlement with respect to such Merger
Litigation, and the Company will in good faith take such comments into
account.

 



 

Section 5.9 _Directors  and Officers Indemnification and Insurance_.

 



 

(a) For a period of six (6) years from and after the Effective Time, the
Surviving Corporation shall indemnify, advance expenses to, and hold harmless
all past and present officers and directors of the Company (" _Indemnified
Persons_ ") to the same extent and in the same manner such persons are
indemnified as of the date hereof by the Company pursuant to any
indemnification agreements between such Indemnified Persons and the Company,
the DGCL, the Company Certificate of Incorporation and the Company Bylaws for
acts or omissions occurring at or prior to the Effective Time; _provided_ that
in the case of advancement of expenses, any person to whom expenses are
advanced provides an undertaking, to the extent required by the DGCL, to repay
such advance if it is ultimately determined that such person is not entitled
to indemnification. The Certificate of Incorporation and the Bylaws of the
Surviving Corporation will contain provisions with respect to exculpation,
advancement and indemnification that are at least as favorable to the
Indemnified Persons as those contained in the Company Certificate of
Incorporation and the Company Bylaws as in effect on the date hereof, which
provisions will not be amended, repealed or otherwise modified for a period of
not less than six years from the Effective Time in any manner that would
adversely affect the rights thereunder of individuals who, immediately prior
to the Effective Time, were directors, officers, employees or agents of the
Company, unless such a modification is required by Law.

 



      
 

 



 

(b) From the Effective Time until the sixth (6th) anniversary of the Effective
Time, Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall maintain in effect, for the
benefit of the Indemnified Persons with respect to their acts and omissions as
directors, officers, employees or agents of the Company occurring prior to the
Effective Time, the existing policy of directors and officers liability
insurance maintained by the Company as of the date hereof in the form
delivered by the Company to Parent prior to the date hereof (the " _Existing D
andO Policy_"), to the extent that directors and officers liability insurance
coverage is commercially available; _provided_ that: (i) Parent and the
Surviving Corporation may substitute for the Existing DandO Policy a policy or
policies of comparable coverage, including a "tail" insurance policy; and (ii)
the Surviving Corporation shall not be required to pay annual premiums for the
Existing DandO Policy (or for any substitute or "tail" policies) in excess of
$600,000 (the " _Maximum Premium_ "). In the event any future annual premiums
for the Existing DandO Policy (or any substitute policies) exceed the Maximum
Premium, the Surviving Corporation shall be entitled to reduce the amount of
coverage of the Existing DandO Policy (or any substitute or "tail" policies) to
the amount of coverage that can be obtained for a premium equal to the Maximum
Premium.

 



 

(c) The rights set forth in this _Section 5.9_ are in addition to, and not in
limitation of, and Parent shall, and shall cause the Surviving Corporation to,
enforce and honor, to the fullest extent permitted by Law for a period of six
(6) years from the Effective Time, the rights otherwise available to the
current officers and directors of the Company and its Subsidiaries by Law,
charter, bylaw or Contract, and shall operate for the benefit of, and shall be
enforceable by, each of the Indemnified Persons and their Representatives.

 



 

(d) In the event Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any of their respective
successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any other Person
and shall not be the continuing or surviving corporation or entity in such
consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers all or substantially all of its
properties and assets to any Person, then, and in either such case, proper
provision shall be made so that the successors and assigns of Parent or the
Surviving Corporation, as the case may be, shall assume the obligations set
forth in this _Section 5.9_.

 



      
 

 



 

Section 5.10 _Conveyance Taxes_. The Company and Parent shall cooperate in the
preparation, execution and filing of all returns, questionnaires, applications
or other documents regarding any real property transfer or gains, sales, use,
transfer, value added, stock transfer and stamp taxes, any transfer,
recording, registration and other fees, and any similar taxes that become
payable in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
that are required or permitted to be filed on or before the Effective Time.

 



 

Section 5.11 _Delisting_. Each of the parties hereto agrees to cooperate with
each other in taking, or causing to be taken, all actions necessary to delist
the Company Common Stock from the Nasdaq and terminate registration under the
Exchange Act; _provided_ that such delisting and termination shall not be
effective until or after the Effective Time.

 



 

Section 5.12 _Financing_.

 



 

(a) Parent shall use its reasonable best efforts to: (i) negotiate and execute
definitive agreements (the " _Definitive Debt Agreements_ ") with respect to
the Debt Financing on the terms and conditions contemplated by the Debt
Financing Commitment or, to the extent the financing contemplated by the Debt
Financing Commitment is not available to Parent, on terms that do not contain
any conditions to the receipt of such Debt Financing that are materially less
favorable, in the aggregate, to Parent and the Company (as determined in the
reasonable judgment of Parent, and with such determination based in part on
the relevant closing conditions) than the terms of the Debt Financing
Commitment and subject to the additional limitations set forth in _Section
5.12(c)_, (ii) satisfy on a timely basis all conditions set forth in the Debt
Financing Commitment (and the Definitive Debt Agreements) applicable to Parent
and Merger Sub that are within their control, (iii) obtain, at or prior to the
Closing Date, the financing necessary such that Parent and Merger Sub, in
either case, will have at and after the Closing funds sufficient to pay all of
the amounts payable under _Article I_ or otherwise in connection with the
Merger and all fees and expenses of the parties hereto associated with the
consummation of the Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby and
(iv) comply with Parents and Merger Subs obligations under the Debt
Financing Commitment (and the Definitive Debt Agreements) and not take or fail
to take any action that would reasonably be expected to prevent or delay the
availability of the Financing on the terms and conditions contemplated by the
Financing Commitments. In the event that all conditions contained in the
Financing Commitments (other than, with respect to the Debt Financing, the
availability of the Equity Financing) have been satisfied, Parent shall use
its reasonable best efforts to cause the Lenders and the Sponsor to fund the
Financing on the Closing Date, including, in the event of a breach or default
by the other parties thereto, by enforcing in a timely manner its rights
(including by seeking specific performance of the other parties thereto) under
the Financing Commitments and/or the applicable definitive agreements
therefor. If any portion of the Debt Financing becomes unavailable or if
Parent becomes aware of any event or circumstance that would, or would
reasonably be expected to, make any portion of the Debt Financing to become
unavailable, in each case, on the terms and conditions contemplated in the
Debt Financing Commitments, Parent shall use its reasonable best efforts to
arrange to obtain alternative financing from alternative sources on terms that
comply with the limitations on amendments, modifications and replacements of
the Debt Financing Commitment set forth in the first sentence of _Section
5.12(c)_, and in an amount sufficient, together with the Equity Financing to
pay all of the amounts payable under _Article I_ or otherwise in connection
with the Merger and all fees and expenses relating to the consummation of the
Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby, as promptly as
practicable following the occurrence of such event. Parent shall give the
Company prompt notice of any material breach by any party to the Financing
Commitments of which Parent becomes aware or any termination of the Financing
Commitments.

 



      
 

 



 

(b) Prior to the Closing, the Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to
provide all cooperation reasonably requested by Parent, and to cause its
Subsidiaries and Representatives to so cooperate, in connection with the
arrangement of the Debt Financing, including by: (i) furnishing Parent and its
financing sources as promptly as practicable with financial and other
pertinent information regarding the Company and its Subsidiaries required
under the Debt Financing Commitment, as may be reasonably requested in writing
by Parent, including all financial statements and projections and other
pertinent information required by the Debt Financing Commitment and reasonably
requested in writing by Parent (other than information for which the Company
is dependent on information to be provided by Parent to the Company in order
to prepare such financial statements and projections, unless such information
is provided to the Company by Parent or the Lender or any of their respective
Representatives at least five (5) Business Days prior to the date required to
be delivered by the Company), (ii) participating in a reasonable number
meetings, presentations, road shows, due diligence sessions, drafting sessions
and sessions with rating agencies, (iii) assisting with the preparation of
materials for rating agency presentations, confidential information memoranda
and similar documents required in connection with the Financing and (iv)
executing and delivering any pledge and security documents, currency or
interest hedging arrangements, other definitive financing documents, or other
certificates, legal opinions or documents as may be reasonably requested by
Parent or otherwise reasonably facilitating the pledging of collateral (
_provided_ that such documents will not take effect until the Effective Time);
_provided_ that nothing herein shall require such cooperation to the extent it
would unreasonably interfere with the business or operations of the Company or
its Subsidiaries; _provided_ , _further_ , that, notwithstanding the
foregoing, no obligations of the Company, its Subsidiaries or their respective
Affiliates or Representatives under any agreement, document or instrument
executed or delivered by the Company, its Subsidiaries or their respective
Affiliates or Representatives pursuant to the Companys obligations under this
_Section 5.12(b)_ shall be effective until the Effective Time, and the
Company Board of Directors shall not be required to pass resolutions or
consents to approve the Debt Financing; _provided_ , _further_ , that nothing
herein shall require such assistance to the extent it would require the
Company to pay (or to agree to pay) any fees, reimburse any expenses, incur
any liability or give any indemnities prior to the Effective Time for which it
is not promptly reimbursed or indemnified. If the Closing does not occur,
Parent shall indemnify and hold harmless the Company and its Subsidiaries and
their respective Representatives for and against any and all losses actually
suffered or incurred by them in connection with the arrangement of the Debt
Financing, any action taken by them at the request of Parent pursuant to this
_Section 5.12(b)_ and any information utilized in connection therewith (other
than information provided by the Company or its Subsidiaries). All non-public
or otherwise confidential information regarding the Company or its
Subsidiaries obtained by Parent or its Representatives pursuant to this
_Section 5.12_ shall be kept confidential in accordance with the
Confidentiality Agreement.

 



      
 

 



 

(c) Neither Parent nor Merger Sub shall amend, modify, alter, waive, replace
or agree to amend, modify, alter, waive or replace (in any case whether by
action or inaction and including by entering into the Definitive Debt
Agreements or obtaining any Alternative Financing Commitment) any term of the
Financing Commitments (or, if entered into, the Definitive Debt Agreements) if
such amendment, modification, alteration, waiver or replacement (x) reduces
the aggregate amount of the Financing (including by increasing the amount of
fees to be paid or original issue discount of the Debt Financing unless the
Equity Financing is increased by a corresponding amount and after giving
effect to the exercise of any lender flex provisions provided under the Debt
Financing Commitment and the Fee Letter) beyond the amount necessary for
Parent and Merger Sub to sufficiently pay all of the amounts payable under
_Article I_ or otherwise in connection with the Merger and all fees and
expenses relating to the consummation of the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated thereby or (y) imposes new or additional conditions or otherwise
expands, amends or modifies any of the conditions to the receipt of the
Financing in a manner that would reasonably be expected to (I) delay or
prevent the Closing Date, (II) make the funding of the Financing (or
satisfaction of the conditions to obtaining the Financing) less likely to
occur or (III) adversely impact the ability of Parent or Merger Sub, as
applicable, to enforce its rights against other parties to the Financing
Commitments or the definitive agreements with respect thereto, and each of
Parent and Merger Sub shall use its reasonable best efforts to take, or cause
to be taken, all actions and to do, or cause to be done, all things necessary,
proper or advisable to arrange and obtain the Financing on the terms and
conditions described in the Financing Commitments (including any lender flex
provisions contained in the Fee Letter), including using its reasonable best
efforts to (i) maintain in effect the Financing Commitments and, following
execution thereof, the Definitive Debt Agreements, (ii) satisfy on a timely
basis all conditions applicable to the Parent and Merger Sub to obtaining the
Debt Financing at the Closing set forth therein that are within its control,
(iii) enter into the Definitive Debt Agreements on the terms and conditions
contemplated by the Debt Financing Commitment (other than changes to such
terms and conditions as a result of the exercise of any lender flex provisions
contained in the Fee Letter or other changes that comply with the limitations
set forth in the first sentence of this _Section 5.12(c)_) and provide copies
of such definitive agreements to the Company and (iv) upon satisfaction of the
conditions set forth in the Financing Commitments, consummate the Financing at
or prior to the Closing. In the event any portion of the Debt Financing
becomes unavailable or if Parent becomes aware of any event or circumstance
that would, or would reasonably be expected to, make any portion of the Debt
Financing unavailable, in each case on the terms and conditions contemplated
in the Debt Financing Commitment (including any lender flex provisions
contained in the Fee Letter and other than changes to such terms and
conditions that, in each case, do not reduce the aggregate committed amount
beyond the amount necessary for Parent and Merger Sub to sufficiently pay all
of the amounts payable under _Article I_ or otherwise in connection with the
Merger and all fees and expenses relating to the consummation of the Merger
and the other transactions contemplated thereby, or the conditionality of, the
Debt Financing Commitment), Parent shall promptly notify the Company (and in
any event within one (1) Business Day thereof) and shall use its reasonable
best efforts to arrange to obtain alternative financing from alternative
sources on terms that comply with the limitations on amendments, modifications
and replacements of the Debt Financing Commitment set forth in the first
sentence of this _Section 5.12(c)_ and in an amount sufficient to pay all of
the amounts payable under _Article I_ or otherwise in connection with the
Merger and all fees and expenses relating to the consummation of the Merger
and the other transactions contemplated hereby, as promptly as practicable
following the occurrence of such event.

 



       
 

 



 

(d) Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall take any and all actions
reasonably necessary to ensure that any distributions by the Surviving
Corporation to the Company Common Stockholders in connection with this
Agreement, if any, shall be made in compliance with the DGCL and without any
liability to the Indemnified Parties or the Company Common Stockholders under
the DGCL.

 



 

(e) At the Closing, Parent shall provide to Fenwick and West LLP, counsel to the
Company, Federal Reserve Wire Network reference numbers reflecting the funding
to Parent of amounts dispersed to Parent (or one or more of Parents
Subsidiaries) pursuant to the Financing.

 



 

Section 5.13 _Section 16 Matters_. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company
shall, and shall be permitted to, take all such steps as may reasonably be
necessary to cause the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including
any dispositions of shares of Company Common Stock (including any Company
Common Stock Options, Company RSUs or shares of Company Restricted Stock) by
each Person who is or will be subject to the reporting requirements of Section
16(a) of the Exchange Act with respect to the Company, to be exempt under Rule
16b-3 under the Exchange Act.

 



 

Section 5.14 _Section 280G Matters_. Parent and Merger Sub shall use their
respective commercially reasonable efforts to mitigate any "parachute
payments" (within the meaning of Section 280G of the Code) to "disqualified
individuals" (within the meaning of Section 280G of the Code) of the Company,
which efforts may include analyses with respect to reasonable compensation and
the valuation of noncompetition agreements; _provided_ that none of Parent,
any Subsidiary of Parent and the Company shall be required to gross-up or
otherwise reimburse any such individual for any excess Tax liability relating
to any such "parachute payments."

 



 

Section 5.15 _Employee Benefits_.

 



 

(a) During the one-year period commencing at the Effective Time, Parent shall
provide to the employees of the Company and its Subsidiaries who remain
employed by the Company or its Subsidiaries in the United States (the "
_Continuing Employees_ ") compensation and benefits (but excluding any equity-
based compensation) that are in the aggregate not materially less favorable
than the compensation and benefits (but excluding any equity-based
compensation) being provided to the Continuing Employees immediately prior to
the Effective Time under the Company Benefit Plans. Each Continuing Employee
shall, to the extent permitted by applicable Law, receive full credit for
purposes of eligibility and vesting. With respect to any health benefit plans
maintained by Parent for the benefit of the Continuing Employees located in
the United States, subject to any applicable plan provisions, contractual
requirements or applicable Law, Parent shall: (i) use commercially reasonable
efforts to cause to be waived any eligibility requirements or pre-existing
condition limitations in the plan year in which the Effective Time occurs, to
the extent satisfied or waived under a similar Company Benefit Plan as of the
Effective Time and (ii) give effect, in determining any deductible maximum
out-of-pocket limitations in the plan year in which the Effective Time occurs,
to amounts paid by such Continuing Employees with respect to substantially
similar plans maintained by the Company or its Subsidiaries during the plan
year in which the Effective Time occurs.

 



      
 

 



 

(b) Nothing in this Agreement shall be deemed to (i) require or guarantee
employment for any period of time for, or preclude the ability of Parent or
the Surviving Corporation or any of their Affiliates to terminate, any
Continuing Employee at any time and for any or no reason, (ii) require Parent
or the Surviving Corporation to establish or continue any benefit or
compensation plan, program, agreement or arrangement or prevent the amendment,
modification or termination thereof at any time, or (iii) establish or amend
any benefit or compensation plan, program, agreement or arrangement. The
parties hereto acknowledge and agree that this _Section 5.15_ is included in
this Agreement for the sole benefit of the parties hereto, and that nothing in
this Agreement, whether express or implied, shall be construed to create any
third-party beneficiary or other rights in any other Person, including any
employees or former employees of the Company, any of its Subsidiaries or
Affiliates or any Continuing Employee, or any dependent or beneficiary
thereof, other than the parties hereto.

The party desiring to terminate this Agreement pursuant to subsection _(b)_ ,
_(c)_ , _(d)_ , _(e)_ , _(f)_ , _(g)_ , _(h)_ , _(i)_ or _(j)_ of this
_Section 7.1_ shall give written notice of such termination to the other

(b) _Company Termination Fee_.

 



 

(i) If this Agreement is terminated (A) by the Company pursuant to _Section

Expenses previously paid to Parent pursuant to _Section 7.2(c)_, if any) by
wire transfer of immediately available funds ( _it being understood and
agreed_ that Parent shall provide the Company with the applicable account
information promptly upon request therefor); _provided_ that, in the case of a
termination pursuant to clause (C), prior to such termination an Acquisition
Proposal shall have been announced, or otherwise made publicly known, and not
withdrawn; _provided_ , _further_ , that in the case of a termination pursuant

(ii) For the avoidance of doubt, in no event shall the Company be obligated to
pay, or cause to be paid, the Company Termination Fee on more than one
occasion.

 



 

(iii) Subject to _Section 8.8_, if the Company becomes obligated to pay the
Company Termination Fee pursuant to this _Section 7.2(b)_, Parent and Merger
Sub agree that Parents right to receive the Company Termination Fee from the
Company shall be Parents and Merger Subs sole and exclusive remedy against
the Company and the Company Group and, upon payment of the Company Termination
Fee, neither the Company nor any member of the Company Group shall have any
liability or obligation to Parent or Merger Sub relating to or arising out of
this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby.

 



 

(c) _Expense Reimbursement_. In the event this Agreement is terminated under
_Section 7.1(g)_ (Company Breach) due to a willful breach by the Company,
then the Company shall, following receipt of an invoice therefor, promptly (in
any event within two (2) Business Days) pay up to $2,000,000 of Parents
reasonable and documented out-of-pocket fees and expenses (including legal
fees and expenses) incurred by Parent and its Affiliates on or prior to the
termination of this Agreement in connection with the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement (including the Financing) (the " _Parent Expenses_ "), by
wire transfer of same day funds to one or more accounts designated by Parent;
_provided_ that the existence of circumstances that could require the Company
Termination Fee to become subsequently payable by the Company pursuant to
_Section 7.2(b)_ shall not relieve the Company of its obligations to pay the
Parent Expenses pursuant to this _Section 7.2(c)_; _provided_ , _further_ ,
that the payment by the Company of Parent Expenses pursuant to this _Section
7.2(c)_ shall not relieve the Company of any subsequent obligation to pay the
Company Termination Fee pursuant to _Section 7.2(b)_ except to the extent
indicated in _Section 7.2(b)_.

 



      
 

 



 

(d) _Parent Termination Fee_.

 



 

(i) In the event (A) the conditions to Closing set forth in _Section 6.1_ and
_Section 6.2_ have been satisfied or waived (other than those conditions that
by their nature are to be satisfied at the Closing and that would be capable
of being satisfied if there were a Closing), (B) Parent fails to complete the
Closing and (C) the Company terminates this Agreement pursuant to _Section
7.1(h)_ (Parent Breach) or _Section 7.1(i)_ (Failure to Close) by sending a
notice of termination that includes a demand, which demand shall be
irrevocable, to receive the Parent Termination Fee. Parent shall pay or cause
to be paid the Parent Termination Fee to the Company promptly, and in any
event within two (2) Business Days following such termination, by wire
transfer of immediately available funds ( _it being understood and agreed_
that the Company shall provide Parent with the applicable account information
promptly upon request therefor). Notwithstanding the foregoing, and without
limiting the Companys right to seek specific performance pursuant to _Section
8.8_, and other than in the case of fraud, the Companys right to receive the
Parent Termination Fee pursuant to this _Section 7.2(d)(i)_ shall be of no
further force or effect if the Company makes any demand or claim for damages
suffered as a result of the failure of the Merger to be consummated or for a
breach or failure to perform hereunder under the Limited Guarantee or
otherwise in any Action against any member of the Parent Group other than for
the payment of the Parent Termination Fee.

 



 

(ii) For the avoidance of doubt, in no event shall Parent be obligated to pay,
or cause to be paid, the Parent Termination Fee on more than one occasion.

 



 

(iii) Subject to _Section 8.8_, if Parent becomes obligated to pay the Parent
Termination Fee pursuant to this _Section 7.2(d)_, the Company agrees that
its right to receive the Parent Termination Fee from Parent or from the
Sponsor pursuant to the Limited Guarantee shall be its sole and exclusive
remedy against Parent and the Parent Group and, upon payment of the Parent
Termination Fee, neither Parent nor any member of the Parent Group shall have
any liability or obligation to the Company relating to or arising out of this
Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby.

 



 

(e) _Acknowledgment_. The parties hereto acknowledge that (i) the agreements
contained in this _Section 7.2_ are an integral part of the transactions
contemplated in this Agreement, (ii) the damages resulting from termination of
this Agreement under circumstances where a Company Termination Fee or Parent
Termination Fee is payable are uncertain and incapable of accurate calculation
and therefore, the amounts payable pursuant to _Section 7.2(b)_ or _Section
7.2(d)_ are not a penalty but rather constitute liquidated damages in a
reasonable amount that will compensate Parent or the Company, as the case may
be, for the efforts and resources expended and opportunities foregone while
negotiating this Agreement and in reliance on this Agreement and on the
expectation of the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby and
(iii) without the agreements contained in this _Section 7.2_, the parties
hereto would not have entered into this Agreement.

 



      
 

 



 

Section 7.3 _Effect of Termination_. In the event of termination of this
Agreement by either the Company or Parent as provided in _Section 7.1_, this
Agreement shall forthwith become void and have no effect, without any
liability or obligation on the part of Parent and Merger Sub or the Company,
except that the provisions of _Section 7.1_, _Section 7.2_, this _Section
7.3_ and _Article VIII_ (and the defined terms referenced therein) shall
survive such termination.

 



 

Section 7.4 _Amendment_. This Agreement may be amended by the parties hereto
in writing by action of their respective Boards of Directors at any time
before or after the Company Required Vote has been obtained and prior to the
filing of the Certificate of Merger with the Delaware Secretary; _provided_
that, after the Company Required Vote shall have been obtained, no such
amendment, modification or supplement shall be made that by Law requires the
further approval of the Company Common Stockholders without such further
approval. This Agreement may not be amended, changed or supplemented or
otherwise modified except by an instrument in writing signed on behalf of all
of the parties hereto.

 



 

Section 7.5 _Extension; Waiver_. At any time prior to the Effective Time, each
of the Company, Parent and Merger Sub may (i) extend the time for the
performance of any of the obligations or other acts of the other party, (ii)
waive any inaccuracies in the representations and warranties of the other
party contained in this Agreement or in any document delivered pursuant to
this Agreement or (iii) subject to the provisions of _Section 7.4_, waive
compliance with any of the agreements or conditions of the other parties
contained in this Agreement. Any agreement on the part of a party to any such
extension or waiver shall be valid only if set forth in an instrument in
writing signed on behalf of the party hereto against whom the waiver is to be
effective. The failure of any party hereto to assert any of its rights under
this Agreement or otherwise shall not constitute a waiver of those rights.

 



 

 **ARTICLE VIII 

**

 

 **GENERAL PROVISIONS**

 



 

Section 8.1 _Nonsurvival of Representations and Warranties_. None of the
representations and warranties in this Agreement or in any instrument

to payment of the Company Termination Fee as set forth in _Section 7.2(b)_ or
Parent Expenses as set forth in _Section 7.2(c)_.

 



 

(b) _Remedies of the Company_.

and _Section 6.2_ (other than those conditions that by their nature are to be
satisfied by actions taken at the Closing) have been satisfied or waived on
the date the Closing should have been consummated pursuant to the terms of
this Agreement but for the failure of the Equity Financing to be funded, (ii)
the Debt Financing (including any financing pursuant to Alternative Financing
Commitments that has been obtained in accordance with, and satisfies the
conditions of, _Section 4.5_) has been funded in accordance with the terms
thereof or will be funded in accordance with the terms thereof at the Closing
if the Equity Financing is funded at the Closing and (iii) the Company has
irrevocably confirmed in writing to Parent that if the Equity Financing and
Debt Financing are funded, then it would take all such actions that are within
its control to cause the Closing to occur. For the avoidance of doubt, in no
event shall the Company be entitled to enforce or seek to enforce specifically
the Parents right to cause the Equity Financing to be funded or to complete
the Merger if the Debt Financing has not been funded (or will not be funded at
the Closing if the Equity Financing is funded at the Closing).

 



 

(C) _General_. In no event shall the Company be entitled to seek the remedy of
specific performance of this Agreement other than solely under the specific
circumstances and as specifically set forth in _Sections 8.8(b)(i)(A)_ and
_(B)_. The election to pursue an injunction, specific performance or other

the Company Group have the right to seek or obtain money damages or expense
reimbursement (whether at law or in equity, in contract, in tort or otherwise)
from Parent, Merger Sub, the Sponsor, any member of the Parent Group, any
financing source under this Agreement other than the right of the Company to
payment of the Parent Termination Fee as set forth in _Section 7.2(d)_. In
addition, notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, the
Company, each of its Subsidiaries and each other member of the Company Group
hereby waives any claims against the Lender Parties and hereby agrees that in
no event shall the Lender Parties have any liability or obligation to the
Company, any of its Subsidiaries or any other member of the Company Group
relating to or arising out of this Agreement, the Debt Financing, the Debt
Financing Commitment or the transactions contemplated hereby; _provided_ that,
notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing in this _Section 8.8(b)(iv)_ shall in
any way limit or modify the rights and obligations of Parent, Merger Sub or
the Lender Parties under the Debt Financing Commitment or the obligations of
Parent or Merger Sub to use reasonable best efforts to obtain the Debt
Financing in accordance with _Section 5.12_. In addition to the rights of
Parent and Merger Sub hereunder, Parent and Merger Sub shall be entitled, at
Parent and Merger Subs sole election, to settle any claims arising from or
relating to this Agreement by agreeing to consummate the Merger in accordance
with the terms of this Agreement.

 



 

(c) _Acknowledgement Regarding Available Remedies_. Solely to the extent that
the right of specific performance is explicitly applicable under the terms of
this _Section 8.8_, the parties hereto agree that irreparable damage for
which monetary damages, even if available, would not be an adequate remedy
would occur in the event that the parties hereto do not perform their
obligations under the provisions of this Agreement (including failing to take
such actions as are required of them hereunder to consummate the Merger and
the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement) in accordance with its
specified terms or otherwise breach such provisions. Solely to the extent that
the right of specific performance is explicitly applicable under the terms of
this _Section 8.8_, the parties hereto acknowledge and agree that the parties
hereto shall be entitled to an injunction or injunctions, specific performance
or other equitable relief to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce
specifically the terms and provisions hereof in the courts described in
_Section 8.10_ without proof of damages or otherwise, and that such explicit
rights of specific enforcement are an integral part of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement and without such rights, none of the Company,
Parent or Merger Sub would have entered into this Agreement. Each party agrees
that it will not oppose the granting of an injunction, specific performance
and other equitable relief on the basis that the other parties hereto have an
adequate remedy at law or an award of specific performance is not an
appropriate remedy for any reason at law or in equity to the extent that the
right of specific performance is explicitly applicable under the terms of this
_Section 8.8_. The parties hereto acknowledge and agree that any party
seeking an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement and
to enforce specifically the terms and provisions of this Agreement (to the
extent that the right of specific performance is explicitly applicable under
the terms of this _Section 8.8_) shall not be required to provide any bond or
other security in connection with any such order or injunction.

 



      
 

 



 

(d) _Sole Remedy_. The parties hereto acknowledge and agree that the remedies
provided for in this _Section 8.8_ shall be such parties sole and exclusive
remedies for any breaches of this Agreement or any claims relating to the
transactions contemplated hereby. In furtherance of the foregoing, each party
hereby waives, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable Law, any and all
other rights, claims and causes of action, known or unknown, foreseen or
unforeseen, that exist or may arise in the future, that such party may have
against the other party, the Parent Group or the Company Group, as the case
may be, arising under or based upon any Law (including any securities law,
common law or otherwise) for any breach of the representations and warranties
or covenants contained in this Agreement; _provided_ that nothing in this
_Section 8.8_ shall relieve any party from any liability for fraud.

 



 

Section 8.9 _Severability_. Any term or provision of this Agreement that is
invalid or unenforceable shall not affect the validity or enforceability of
the remaining terms and provision hereof. If the final judgment of a court of
competent jurisdiction declares that any term or provision hereof is invalid,
illegal or unenforceable, the parties hereto agree that the court making such
determination shall have the power to limit the term or provision, to delete
specific words or phrases, or to replace any invalid, illegal or unenforceable
term or provision with a term or provision that is valid, legal and
enforceable and that comes closest to expressing the intention of the invalid,
illegal or unenforceable term or provision, and this Agreement shall be
enforceable as so modified. In the event such court does not exercise the
power granted to it in the prior sentence, the parties hereto agree to replace
such invalid, illegal or unenforceable term or provision with a valid, legal
and enforceable term or provision that will achieve, to the extent possible,
the economic, business and other purposes of such invalid, illegal or
unenforceable term.

 



 

Section 8.10 _Consent to Jurisdiction; Venue_.

 



 

(a) Each of the parties hereto irrevocably submits to the exclusive
jurisdiction of the state courts of Delaware and to the jurisdiction of the
United States District Court for the District of Delaware for the purpose of

otherwise, arising out of or relating to this Agreement and the
Confidentiality Agreement, and each of the parties hereto irrevocably agrees

action shall be conclusive and may be enforced in other jurisdictions by suit

(b) Each of the parties hereto irrevocably consents to the service of any
summons and complaint and any other process in any other action relating to
the Merger, on behalf of itself or its property, by the personal delivery of
copies of such process to such party. Nothing in this _Section 8.10_ shall
affect the right of any party hereto to serve legal process in any other
manner permitted by Law.

 



 

(c) Notwithstanding the foregoing, each of the parties hereto agrees that it
will not bring or support, or permit any of its Affiliates to bring or
support, any action, whether in law or in equity, whether in contract or in
tort or otherwise, against any Lender Party in any way relating to this
Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby, including any dispute
arising out of or relating in any way to the Debt Financing Commitment or the
performance thereof, in any forum other than the Supreme Court of the State of
New York, County of New York, or, if under applicable legal requirement
exclusive jurisdiction is vested in the federal courts, the United States
District Court for the Southern District of New York (and the appellate courts
thereof), and that the provisions of _Section 8.11_ relating to the waiver of
jury trial shall apply to any such action.

WAIVER, (C) EACH SUCH PARTY MAKES THIS WAIVER VOLUNTARILY AND (D) EACH SUCH
