 (iii) with respect to Cash Value Options, the amount of cash equal to the sum of (A) the product of the applicable Option Closing Consideration multiplied by the number of corresponding Cash Value Options represented by such Certificate that have been converted into the right to receive the Option Merger Consideration and (B) if

been converted into the right to receive the Option Merger Consideration;
and 

   

 (iv) with respect to Cash Value Warrants, the amount of cash equal to the sum of (A) the product of the applicable Warrant Closing Consideration multiplied by the number of corresponding Cash Value Warrants represented by such Certificate that have been converted into the right to receive the Warrant Merger Consideration, and (B) if ever monies with respect to the Common Stock Escrow Amount are received by the Exchange Agent, the product of the Common Stock Escrow Amount multiplied by the number of Cash Value Warrants represented by such Certificate that have been converted into the right to receive the Warrant Merger Consideration. 

 

Each such Certificate so surrendered shall be cancelled. The Exchange Agent
shall accept such Certificates upon compliance with such reasonable terms and
conditions as the Exchange Agent may impose to effect an orderly exchange
thereof in accordance with normal exchange practices. After the Effective
Time, there shall be no further transfer on the records of the Company or
its transfer agent of certificates representing shares of Company Capital
Stock, Company Stock Options or Warrants, and if such Certificates are
presented to the Company for transfer, they shall be canceled against
delivery of the Preferred Stock Merger Consideration, the Common Stock Merger
Consideration, the Option Merger Consideration, or the Warrant Merger
Consideration, as the case may be. Until surrendered as contemplated by this
_Section 3.5(b)_, each Certificate for shares of Company Capital Stock,
Company Stock Options or Warrants which have been converted into the right to
receive the Preferred Stock Merger Consideration, the Common Stock Merger
Consideration, the Option Merger Consideration, or the Warrant Merger
Consideration, as the case may be, shall be deemed at any time after the

as contemplated by _ARTICLE 3_. 

   

 (c) _No Further Ownership Rights in Company After New Senior Preferred Stock or Company Common Stock Exchanged for Merger Consideration_.

    ##### 

  

    

with respect thereto) which had been deposited with the Exchange Agent and
which have not been disbursed to holders of Certificates and thereafter such
holders shall be entitled to look only to Parent or the Surviving Corporation
(subject to abandoned property, escheat or other similar laws) as
general creditors thereof with respect to the payment of any Preferred Stock
Merger Consideration, Common Stock Closing Consideration, Option Closing
Consideration, or Warrant Closing Consideration that may be payable to such
Person, as determined pursuant to this Agreement, without any
interest thereon. Notwithstanding the foregoing, none of Parent, the
Surviving Corporation nor the Exchange Agent shall be liable to any holder of
a Certificate for any Preferred Stock Merger Consideration, Common Stock
Merger Consideration, Company Common Stock Option Merger Consideration, or
Warrant Merger Consideration delivered to a public official pursuant to any
applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar Law. 

   

 (e) _Transfers of Ownership_. If any portion of the Preferred Stock Merger Consideration, Common Stock Merger Consideration, Option Merger Consideration, or Warrant Merger Consideration, as the case may be, is to be paid to a Person other than the Person in whose name the Certificate is registered, it shall be a condition of the exchange or payment that such Certificate shall be properly endorsed or otherwise in proper form for transfer and that the Person requesting such exchange or payment shall pay any transfer or other Taxes required by reason of the exchange or payment to a Person other than the registered holder of such Certificate or establish to the reasonable satisfaction of Parent that such Tax has been paid or is not applicable. 

   

 (f) _Taxes_. Parent, the Company or the Surviving Corporation, as the case may be, shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from consideration otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement to any holder such amounts as are required to be deducted and withheld with respect to the making of such payment under the Code, or any provision of state, local or foreign Tax Law. To the extent that amounts are so withheld, (i) such withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the holder in respect of which such deduction and withholding was made, and (ii) Parent, the Company or the Surviving Corporation, as the case may be, shall provide to such holder written notice of the amounts so deducted or withheld. 

   

 (g) _Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates_. In the event any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, the Exchange Agent shall issue and pay in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the holder thereof, the portion of the Preferred Stock Merger Consideration, Common Stock Merger Consideration, Option Merger Consideration, or Warrant Merger Consideration, as the case may be, payable pursuant to the terms of this Agreement; _provided_ , _however_ _,_ that Parent may, in its discretion and as a condition precedent to the issuance and payment thereof, require the owner of such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate to deliver to Parent an affidavit of loss, theft or destruction in form reasonably satisfactory to Parent, but in no case shall Parent, the Company or the Exchange Agent require the posting by any such owner of a bond, as indemnity against any claim that may be made against Parent, Merger Sub, the Surviving Corporation, the Company or any of their respective directors, officers, employees, Subsidiaries, affiliates or agents with respect thereto. 

    #####

disclosure of any competitive information, and that the Company shall not be

    ##### 

  

    

the event of a disagreement concerning any such filing, application, notice,
analysis, appearance, presentation, memorandum, brief, argument, opinion or
proposal, the determinations of the Company, or, to the extent relating to
any merger control, antitrust, competition, foreign ownership or investment
or similar Law, the determinations of Parent, shall be conclusive; and

Authority relating to the approval or disapproval of the transactions
contemplated hereby; and (ii) not participate in any meetings or substantive

voluntary submission relating to the Competition Act (Canada) or the

 (b) The Company shall give prompt notice to Parent and Merger Sub, and Parent and Merger Sub shall give prompt notice to the Company, of: (i) any notice or other communication of which the Company, Parent or Merger Sub, as applicable, has Knowledge, received from any Person alleging that the consent of such Person is or may be required in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and (ii) any notice or other communication of which the Company, Parent or Merger Sub, as applicable, has Knowledge, received from any Governmental Authority in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

If the Company shall fail to obtain any consent from a third Person described in this subsection (a), the Company will use its commercially reasonable efforts to limit the adverse affect upon the Company, their respective Subsidiaries, and their respective businesses resulting, or that could reasonably be expected to result from the failure to obtain such consent.

 (a) From and after the Effective Time, Parent shall, and shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, indemnify, defend and hold harmless each person who is now, or has been at any time prior to the date of this Agreement or who becomes such prior to the Effective Time, an officer, director or fiduciary of any of the HOB Entities (the " _Indemnified D andO Parties_") against (i) any and all losses, claims, damages, costs, expenses (including reasonable attorneys fees and expenses), fines, liabilities or judgments or amounts that are paid in settlement with the approval of Parent (which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned) of or in connection with any claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation based in whole or in part on 

   ##### 

  

    

or arising in whole or in part out of the fact that such person is or was a
director, officer or fiduciary of any of the HOB Entities whether pertaining
to any action or omission existing or occurring at or prior to the Effective
Time and whether asserted or claimed prior to, or at or after, the Effective
Time (" _Indemnified D andO Liabilities_"), and (ii) all Indemnified DandO
Liabilities based in whole or in part on, or arising in whole or in part out
of, or pertaining to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby;
provided, however, that, in the case of the Company and the Surviving
Corporation such indemnification shall be to the fullest extent a corporation
is permitted under the DGCL to indemnify its own directors, officers
or fiduciaries, and in the case of Parent such indemnification shall not be
limited by the DGCL. Parent, the Company, and the Surviving Corporation, as
the case may be, will pay all expenses of each Indemnified DandO Party in
advance of the final disposition of any such action or proceeding to the
fullest extent permitted by Law. Without limiting the foregoing, in the event

satisfactory to them and Parent and Merger Sub, (ii) Parent shall, and shall
cause the Surviving Corporation to, pay all reasonable fees and expenses of
such counsel for the Indemnified DandO Parties promptly as statements therefor
are received, and (iii) Parent shall, and shall cause the Surviving
Corporation to, use all reasonable efforts to assist and cooperate in the
vigorous defense of any such matter, _provided_ that none of Parent, Merger
Sub or the Surviving Corporation shall be liable for any settlement of any
claim effected without its written consent, which consent, however, shall not
be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned. Any Indemnified DandO Party
wishing to claim indemnification under this _Section 8.10_, upon learning of
any such claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation, shall notify
Parent, Merger Sub or the Surviving Corporation (but the failure so to notify
an indemnifying party shall not relieve it from any liability which it may
have under this _Section 8.10_ except to the extent such failure materially
prejudices such party). In the event any Indemnified DandO Party is required to
bring any action to enforce rights or to collect moneys due under this
Agreement and is successful in such action Parent shall reimburse such
Indemnified DandO Party for all its expenses in bringing and pursuing such
action. Each Indemnified DandO Party shall be entitled to the advancement of
expenses to the full extent contemplated in this _Section 8.10_ in connection
with any such action. 

  

 (b) _Successors_. In the event Parent or any of its successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any other Person and shall not be the continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers all or substantially all of its properties and assets to any Person, then and in either such case, proper provisions shall be made so that the continuing or surviving entity or transferee, as appropriate, shall assume the obligations set forth in this _Section 8.10_. 

  

 (c) _Survival of Indemnification_. To the fullest extent not prohibited by Law, from and after the Effective Time, all rights to indemnification as of the date hereof in favor of the directors, officers and fiduciaries of any of the HOB Entities with respect to their activities as such prior to the Effective Time, as provided in their respective Organizational Documents in effect on the date hereof, or otherwise in effect on the date hereof, shall survive the Merger and shall continue in full force and effect for a period of not less than six years from the Effective Time, _provided_ that in the event any claim or claims are asserted or made within such six-year period, all such rights to indemnification in respect of such claim or claims shall continue until the final disposition thereof.

 Section 8.11 _Updates to Disclosure Schedules_.

No such supplement or amendment by the Company of its Disclosure Schedules shall be deemed to cure, or to be a waiver of, any breach of any representation or warranty made in this Agreement for any purpose hereunder including, without limitation,  _Articles 9, 10 and 11_. 

  

 Section 8.12 _Efforts to Close_. Through the Closing Date, subject to the terms and conditions herein provided and _provided_ that nothing herein shall require any party to waive any of the conditions set forth in _Section 8.1_, the Parties will, and will cause the respective subsidiaries within their control to, use commercially reasonable efforts to take all reasonable actions and do all reasonable things necessary, proper or advisable, under Laws, contract or otherwise to consummate and make effective, as soon as reasonably practicable, the Merger and the transactions contemplated hereby, including the satisfaction of all conditions thereto set forth herein.

part, on length of service, credit will be given to current employees of any

such crediting of service does not result in duplication of benefits. Parent

their terms all employee benefit plans (as defined in Section 3(3) of ERISA)
and the other Company Employee Benefit Plans; _provided_ ,  _however_ , that
Parent or the Surviving Corporation may amend, modify or terminate

beneficiaries of such Company Employee Benefit Plan to the extent required
thereunder) _provided_ , _further_ , that, except for the Company
Option Plans which will be terminated in accordance with _Section 3.3_
hereof, for a period of two (2) years following the Closing Date, no such
amendment, modification or termination shall result in compensation and
benefits to the employees, former employees, directors or former directors
of any of the HOB Entities (the " _Company Employees_ ") that are less
favorable, in the aggregate, than the compensation and benefits that are
provided to the Company Employees immediately prior to the Closing Date.

INDEMNIFICATION  

  

 Section 10.1 _Survival of Representations and Warranties and Certain Covenants_. All representations and warranties made by the Company, the Named Stockholders and Parent in this Agreement shall survive the Closing and continue until the Escrow Release Date. Any rights with respect to a claimed breach of a representation or warranty shall expire at the Escrow 

   ##### 

  

    

Release Date, unless on or prior to the Escrow Release Date written notice
asserting such claimed breach has been timely given in accordance with
_Section 10.3_ to the party from whom recovery is sought on or prior to the
Escrow Release Date at which point the claim to which such notice relates may
continue to be asserted beyond the Escrow Release Date. All other covenants
and agreements in this Agreement shall survive the Closing and continue in
full force and effect indefinitely. 

  

 Section 10.2 _General Indemnification_. 

  

 (a) _By the Company Stockholders_. From and after the Closing Date, the Company Stockholders shall jointly and severally indemnify and hold harmless the Parent, its Subsidiaries, and its Affiliates (including for this purpose, the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries), and each of their respective officers, directors, shareholders, owners, affiliates and employees, and each such persons successors and assigns (collectively, the " _Parent Indemnified Parties_ ") solely from the Escrow Account, from and against all Damages (as hereinafter defined) imposed upon or incurred by any Parent Indemnified Parties as a result of, in connection with, or arising out of (i) any breach of any representation or warranty of the Company or the Named Stockholders, as applicable, contained in this Agreement and (ii) any breach or violation of any covenant, agreement or other obligation of the Company Stockholder Representative, the Company or the Named Stockholders contained in this Agreement; _provided_ that the Company Stockholders shall not have any obligation hereunder with respect to any breach described in _Section 10.2(a)(i)_ unless the Parent Indemnified Parties have made a claim for indemnification pursuant to _Section 10.3_ with respect to such breach on or prior to the Escrow Release Date. In the case of any representation or warranty that is limited by "material" or by any similar term or limitation, the occurrence of a breach or inaccuracy of such representation or warranty, as the case may be, and the amount of losses subject to indemnification hereunder shall be determined as if "material" or by any similar term or limitation were not included therein. As used herein, " _Damages_ " means any and all losses, liabilities, damages, judgments, settlements and expenses (including interest and penalties recovered by a third party with respect thereto and attorneys fees and expenses, and accountants fees and expenses incurred in the investigation or defense of any of the same or in asserting, preserving or enforcing any of the rights arising under this _ARTICLE 10_ ). NOTWITHSTANDING ANYTHING IN THIS AGREEMENT TO THE CONTRARY, THE COMPANY STOCKHOLDERS SHALL NOT BE REQUIRED TO INDEMNIFY OR HOLD HARMLESS ANY PARENT INDEMNIFIED PARTY OR OTHERWISE COMPENSATE ANY PARENT INDEMNIFIED PARTY FOR DAMAGES WITH RESPECT TO LOST PROFITS, RESTITUTION, DAMAGE TO REPUTATION, DIMINUTIONS IN VALUE, MENTAL OR EMOTIONAL DISTRESS, EXEMPLARY, CONSEQUENTIAL, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES. 

   

 (b) _By Parent_. From and after the Closing Date, Parent and its Subsidiaries, including the Surviving Corporation, shall jointly and severally indemnify and hold harmless the Company Stockholders and (without duplication) each of their respective Subsidiaries, Affiliates officers, directors, shareholders, owners and employees, and each such Persons successors and assigns (collectively, the " _HOB Indemnified Parties_ "), from and against all Damages imposed upon or incurred by any HOB Indemnified Parties as a result of, in connection with, or arising out of (i) any breach of any representation or warranty of Parent contained in this Agreement, (ii) 

    ##### 

  

    

any breach or violation of any covenant, agreement or other obligation of
Parent or Merger Sub contained in this Agreement and (iii) the ownership,
operation or management of the Surviving Corporation, its Subsidiaries or any
of its or their respective assets, properties or businesses following the
Closing Date; _provided_ that Parent shall not have any obligation
hereunder with respect to any breach described in _Section 10.2(b)(i)_
unless the Company Stockholder Representative has made a claim for
indemnification pursuant to _Section 10.3_ with respect to such breach on or
prior to the Escrow Release Date. EXCEPT WITH RESPECT TO BREACHES OF 
_SECTION 8.6_ , PARENT AND ITS SUBSIDIARIES SHALL NOT BE REQUIRED TO INDEMNIFY
OR HOLD HARMLESS ANY HOB INDEMNIFIED PARTY OR OTHERWISE COMPENSATE ANY HOB
INDEMNIFIED PARTY FOR DAMAGES WITH RESPECT TO LOST PROFITS, RESTITUTION,
DAMAGE TO REPUTATION, DIMINUTIONS IN VALUE, MENTAL OR EMOTIONAL DISTRESS,
EXEMPLARY, CONSEQUENTIAL, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES; IT
BEING UNDERSTOOD AND AGREED BY THE PARTIES HERETO THAT ALL SUCH DAMAGES ARE
FORESEEABLE, LIKELY AND PROBABLE WITH RESPECT TO ANY BREACHES OF _SECTION
8.6_ HEREOF BY PARENT AND ITS AFFILIATES. 

   

 (c) _Limitation on Indemnity_. 

   

 (i) There shall be no amount payable by the Company Stockholders from the Escrow Account pursuant to the indemnification obligations under _Section 10.2(a)(i)_, unless and until the cumulative amount of all Damages determined to have been incurred by the Parent Indemnified Parties as a result of all such breaches exceeds $1,500,000 (the " _Deductible_ "); (and then only for those Damages in excess of such amount), _provided_ that individual claims involving Damages of $15,000 or less shall not be subject to indemnity hereunder or included in the Deductible or in the calculation of Damages for any reason. 

  

 (ii) Notwithstanding anything else to the contrary contained in this Agreement, the maximum aggregate amount of Damages for which indemnity may be recovered from the Company Stockholders arising out of or resulting from the causes enumerated in _Section 10.2(a)(i)_ shall be an amount equal to the Escrow Amount ( _i.e._ , $10,000,000) (the " _Cap_ "), and the Parent Indemnified Parties shall have no recourse against any assets of the Company Stockholders or any of their respective Affiliates for Damages for which indemnity may be recovered pursuant to  _Section 10.2(a)(i)_ other than the funds held in the Escrow Account in an amount not to exceed the Cap ( _i.e._ , $10,000,000). 

  

 (iii) The amount of any Damages claimed by any Parent Indemnified Party hereunder shall be net of any allowances and reserves provided in the Financial Statements or the notes thereto that are identified with respect thereto. 

  

 (iv) The amount of any Damages claimed by any Parent Indemnified Party hereunder shall be net of any insurance, indemnity, contribution or other payments or recoveries of a like nature with respect thereto (it being agreed that, promptly after the realization of any such reductions of Damages pursuant hereto, such Parent Indemnified Party shall reimburse the Escrow Account for such reduction in Damages for which such Parent Indemnified Party was indemnified prior to the realization of such reductions of Damages). 

   ##### 

  

    

Parent shall use its reasonable best efforts to (i) cause the Parent
Indemnified Parties to seek the benefits of any insurance, indemnity,
contribution or other payments or recoveries of a like nature applicable to
such Damages and (ii) otherwise mitigate the amount of Damages. 

  

 (v) In the event that an Indemnifying Party can establish that an Indemnified Party had actual knowledge, on or before the Closing, of a breach of a representation, warranty, covenant or agreement of the Indemnifying Party upon which a claim for indemnification by the Indemnified Party is based, then the Indemnifying Party shall have no liability for any Damages resulting from or arising out of such claim. 

  

 (vi) An Indemnified Party shall not be entitled to multiple recovery for the same Damages. 

  

 (vii) In determining the amount of indemnification due under this _ARTICLE 10_ , (i) all payments shall be net of any actual Tax benefit that may be available to the Indemnified Party and (ii) all payments for claims relating to Taxes with respect to periods prior to the Closing Date shall be net of any actual Tax benefits that may be available in periods following the Closing Date attributable to the carryover of any net operating loss from a pre-Closing Date period to a post-Closing Date period. 

  

 (viii) If an Indemnified Party recovers Damages from an Indemnifying Party under this  _ARTICLE 10_ , the Indemnifying Party shall be subrogated, to the extent of such recovery, to the Indemnified Partys rights against any third party with respect to such recovered Damages subject to the subrogation rights of any insurer providing insurance coverage under one of the Indemnified Partys policies and except to the extent that the grant of subrogation rights to the Indemnifying Party is prohibited by the terms of the applicable insurance policy. 

  

 Section 10.3 _Procedures, Third Party Claims_. Any party seeking indemnification under this  _ARTICLE 10_ (an " _Indemnified Party_ ") shall give the party from whom indemnification is being sought (an " _Indemnifying Party_ ") notice of any matter which such Indemnified Party has determined has given or could give rise to a right of indemnification under this Agreement, within 20 days of such determination, stating the amount of the Damages, if known, and method of computation thereof, and containing a reference to the provisions of this Agreement in respect of which such right of indemnification is claimed or arises. With respect to third party claims that may give rise to any indemnification obligations under this Agreement, all claims for indemnification by any Parent Indemnified Party hereunder shall be asserted and resolved as set forth in this _Section 10.3_. In the event that any claim or demand by a third party for which an Indemnifying Party may be liable to any Indemnified Party hereunder (a " _Third Party Claim_ ") is asserted against or sought to be collected from any Indemnified Party by a third party, such Indemnified Party shall as promptly as reasonably practicable notify the Indemnifying Party in writing of such Third Party Claim and the amount or the estimated amount thereof to the extent then feasible (which estimate shall not be conclusive of the final amount of such Third Party Claim) (the " _Claim Notice_ "). The failure on the part of the Indemnified Party to give any such Claim Notice in a reasonably prompt manner shall not relieve the Indemnifying Party of any indemnification obligation hereunder unless, and only to the extent that, the Indemnifying Party is materially prejudiced thereby. The Indemnifying Party shall have thirty (30) days from the 

   ##### 

  

    

receipt of the Claim Notice (the " _Notice Period_ ") to notify the
Indemnified Party (a) whether or not the Indemnifying Party disputes the
liability of the Indemnifying Party to the Indemnified Party hereunder with
respect to such Third Party Claim and (b) whether or not it desires to defend
the Indemnified Party against such Third Party Claim. All costs and
expenses incurred by the Indemnifying Party in defending such Third Party
Claim shall be a liability of, and shall be paid by, the Indemnifying Party
and shall not be deemed Damages hereunder. Except as hereinafter provided, in
the event that the Indemnifying Party notifies the Indemnified Party within
the Notice Period that it desires to defend the Indemnified Party against such
Third Party Claim, the Indemnifying Party shall, at its sole cost and
expense, have the right to defend the Indemnified Party by appropriate
proceedings with counsel of its choice and shall have the power to direct and
control such defense. If any Indemnified Party desires to participate in any
such defense it may do so at its own cost and expense; _provided_ , _however_
, that the reasonable costs and expenses of one counsel (in addition to any
local counsel) to the Indemnified Party will be paid by the Indemnifying
Party if, in the view of counsel to the Indemnified Party, (i) a material
conflict of interest (other than one of a monetary nature) exists between
the Indemnifying Party and any Indemnified Party that would make it
inappropriate for the same counsel to represent both the Indemnified Party
and the Indemnifying Party or (ii) there may be legal defenses available to
the Indemnified Party which are different from or additional to
those available to the Indemnifying Party. The Indemnified Party shall not
settle a Third Party Claim for which it is indemnified by the Indemnifying
Party without the written consent of the Indemnifying Party unless the
Indemnifying Party elects not to defend the Parent Indemnified Party against
such Third Party Claim. The Indemnifying Party may, with the consent of the
Indemnified Party (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld), settle
or compromise for monetary payments only any action or consent to the entry
of any judgment which includes as a term thereof the delivery by the claimant
or plaintiff to the Indemnified Party of a duly executed written
unconditional release of all of the Indemnified Parties from all liability in
respect of such action and there is no finding or admission of any violation
of any Law or the rights of any Person. If the Indemnifying Party elects not
to defend the Indemnified Party against such Third Party Claim, including by
not giving the Indemnified Party timely notice as provided above, then the
amount of any such Third Party Claim, or, if the same be contested by the
Indemnified Party, then that portion thereof as to which such defense is
unsuccessful (and the reasonable costs and expenses pertaining to such
defense) shall be the liability of the Indemnifying Party hereunder, subject
to the limitations set forth in this _ARTICLE 10_. 

  

 Section 10.4 _Purchase Price Adjustment_. Any indemnification payable under this _ARTICLE 10_ shall be, to the extent permitted by Law, an adjustment to the purchase price and the Common Stock Merger Consideration. 

  

 Section 10.5 _Fraudulent Conduct; Intentional Misrepresentation_. Notwithstanding anything contained in this Agreement to the contrary, in the case of fraudulent conduct or intentional misrepresentation, the limitations on indemnification (including as to duration and amount) contained in _Sections 10.1_ and _10.2_ shall not apply to any claim for indemnification under this _ARTICLE 10_ by Parent or Merger Sub. 

   #####

Any vacancy in the position of Company Stockholder Representative shall be filled by a majority-in-interest of the holders of shares of Company Capital Stock.

No bond shall be required of the Company Stockholder Representative, and the Company Stockholder Representative shall not receive compensation for its services. Notices or communications to or from the Company Stockholder Representative shall constitute notice to or from each holder of shares of Company Capital Stock. 

   

 (b) The Company Stockholder Representative shall not have any liability for any Damages to the holders of shares of Company Capital Stock for any action taken or suffered by it or omitted hereunder as Company Stockholder Representative, except as caused by the Company Shareholder Representatives gross negligence or willful misconduct. The Company Stockholder Representative may, in all questions arising hereunder, rely on the advice of counsel, and the Company Stockholder Representative shall not be liable to the holders of shares of Company Capital Stock for anything done, omitted or suffered by the Company Stockholder Representative based on such advice. The Company Stockholder Representative undertakes to perform such duties and only such duties as are specifically set forth in this Agreement and no implied covenants or obligations shall be read into this Agreement against the Company Stockholder Representative. 

   

 (c) A decision, act, consent or instruction of the Company Stockholder Representative shall be deemed to have been taken or given on behalf of all the holders of shares of Company Capital Stock and shall be final, binding and conclusive upon all the holders of shares of Company Capital Stock, and the Parent may rely upon any such decision, act, consent or instruction of the Company Stockholder Representative as being the decision, act, consent or instruction of, and binding on, each of the holders of shares of Company Capital Stock. Parent, the Company and their respective representatives are hereby relieved from any liability to any Person for any acts done by them in accordance with such decision, act, consent or instruction of the Company Stockholder Representative. 

   

 Section 10.7 _Exclusive Remedy_. The indemnification provided in this _ARTICLE 10_ , subject to the limitations set forth herein, shall be the exclusive post-Closing remedy available to any Party in connection with any Damages arising out of or resulting from this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby and the Escrow Account shall be the sole source of remedy for 

   ##### 

   

    

any breach of any representation or warranty by the Company Stockholders under
this Agreement, except only (i) for the remedies of injunctive relief or
specific performance or (ii) in the event of fraudulent conduct or
intentional misrepresentation.

 (a) By the mutual written consent of Parent and the Company; 

   

 (b) by Parent or the Company, upon notice to the other, at any time after 18 months following the Signing Date (the " _Outside Date_ ") if the Closing shall not have occurred on or prior to the Outside Date; _provided_ , _however_ , that the right to terminate this Agreement under this _Section 11.1(b)_ shall not be available to any Party whose failure to comply in any material respect with any obligation under this Agreement shall have been the cause of, or shall have resulted in, the failure of the Closing to occur on or prior to such date,  _provided_ , _further_ , _however_ , that the right to terminate this Agreement under this _Section 11.1(b)_ shall not be available to Parent if the condition to Parents obligations to effect the Merger under _Section 9.3(b)_ has not been satisfied for any reason; 

   

 (c) by Parent, by written notice to the Company, if the Company or the Named Stockholders shall have breached any of their representations, warranties, covenants, obligations or agreements set forth in this Agreement, which breach would result in the failure of a condition set forth in  _Section 9.3_; _provided_ that if such breach is curable by the Company through the exercise of its commercially reasonable efforts prior to the Outside Date after receiving written notice of such breach, then Parent may not terminate this Agreement under this _Section 11.1(c)_ prior to the Outside Date; 

   

 (d) by the Company, by written notice to Parent, if Parent or Merger Sub shall have breached any of its representations, warranties, covenants, obligations or agreements set forth in this Agreement, which breach would result in the failure of a condition set forth in _Section 9.2,_ _provided_ that if such breach is curable by Parent or Merger Sub through the exercise of its commercially reasonable efforts prior to the Outside Date, then the Company may not terminate this Agreement under this _Section 11.1(d)_ prior to the Outside Date.

    ##### 

  

     

 (f) by Parent upon notice to the Company in the event that the Company Stockholder Representative fails to deliver to the Parent, the Company Stockholder Approvals within five (5) days after the Signing Date.

 (b) If this Agreement is terminated (i) by the Company pursuant to _Section 11.1(b)_ and the condition to Parents obligation to effect the Merger set forth in _Section 9.3(b) _has not been satisfied or (ii) by Parent or the Company pursuant to _Section 11.1(e)_, then in either case, the Company shall be entitled to immediately draw fully upon the Irrevocable Letter of Credit to receive a non-refundable termination fee equal to $15,000,000 in cash (the " _Termination Fee_ ").

MISCELLANEOUS PROVISIONS  

  

 Section 12.1 _Expenses_. Except as otherwise specified in this Agreement, all costs and expenses, including fees and disbursements of counsel, financial advisors and accountants, incurred in connection with this Agreement, the agreements contemplated hereby and the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby shall be paid by the Party incurring such costs and expenses, whether or not the Closing shall have occurred, _provided_ , _however_ , that Parent shall pay for all fees and expenses relating to antitrust, competition and foreign investment matters, if any, including the fees and expenses of attorneys, consultants, experts and economists retained by Parent or the Company, any filing fees and other fees and expenses related in any way to obtaining approvals from, contesting, negotiating, resolving and otherwise addressing claims or positions asserted or held by the United States Federal Trade Commission, the Antitrust Division of the United States Department of Justice and other Governmental Authorities.

 Section 12.2 _Disclaimer Regarding Projections_. In connection with Parents investigation of the Company and its Subsidiaries, Parent and its Affiliates and representatives have received from the Company and/or the representatives thereof, certain projections and other forecasts and certain business plan information.

(or in accordance with the latest unrevoked written direction from such
Party), (ii) if delivered by hand or by nationally recognized courier
service, when delivered at the address specified in this _Section 12.4_ (or
in accordance with the latest unrevoked written direction from the receiving
Party) and (iii) if given by telefax, when such telefax is transmitted to the
telefax number specified in this _Section 12.4_ (or in accordance with the
latest unrevoked written direction from the receiving Party), and the
appropriate confirmation is received. 

   

 Section 12.5 _Public Announcements_. No Party shall make, or cause to be made, any press release or public announcement in respect of this Agreement, the Merger or the 

   ##### 

  

    

transactions contemplated hereby or otherwise communicate with any news media
without the prior written consent of the other parties, which consent shall
not be unreasonably withheld or withdrawn, and the Parties shall cooperate as
to the timing and contents of any such press release or public announcement;
_provided_ ,  _however_ , that a Party may, without the prior consent of the
other Parties, make such press release or public announcement as may be
required by Law or any listing agreement with a securities exchange or other
similar regulatory body. The first public announcement by the Parties of
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement shall be in the form of a
joint press release to be jointly prepared and approved by each of Parent and
the Company. 

  

 Section 12.6 _Headings; Table of Contents_. The descriptive headings contained in this Agreement and table of contents of this Agreement are for convenience of reference only and shall not affect in any way the meaning or interpretation of this Agreement. 

  

 Section 12.7 _Severability_. If any term or other provision of this Agreement is determined by a court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced, all other terms and provisions of this Agreement shall nevertheless remain in full force and effect so long as the economic or legal substance of the transactions contemplated hereby is not affected in any manner materially adverse to any Party. Upon such determination that any term or other provision is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced, the Parties shall negotiate in good faith to modify this Agreement so as to effect the original intent of the Parties as closely as possible in an acceptable manner in order that the transactions contemplated hereby are consummated as originally contemplated to the greatest extent possible. 

  

 Section 12.8 _Entire Agreement_. This Agreement, the Confidentiality Agreement and any other agreements attached as Exhibits hereto constitute the entire agreement of the Parties with respect to the subject matter hereof and supersede all prior agreements and undertakings, both written and oral, among the Parties with respect to the subject matter hereof. 

  

 Section 12.9 _Binding Effect; Assignment_. This Agreement shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the Parties and their respective successors and permitted assigns. This Agreement may not be assigned by operation of law or otherwise by either Party without the prior written consent of the other Party (which consent may be granted or withheld in the sole discretion of such other Party), and any attempted assignment in violation of this _Section 12.9_ shall be void, except that Parent or Merger Sub may, without such prior written consent, at any time, transfer or assign, in whole or from time to time in part, its rights or obligations under this Agreement to one or more of its Affiliates or Subsidiaries _provided_ that Parent shall remain completely responsible, and liable, for all of the obligations of such Affiliate or Subsidiary to perform the Parents or the Merger Subs obligations hereunder. 

  

 Section 12.10 _Governing Law_. 

   ##### 

  

  

 (a) This Agreement shall be governed by, and construed in accordance with, the internal laws of the State of Delaware, without giving effect to any choice of law or conflict of law, provision or rule (whether of the State of Delaware or any other jurisdiction) that would cause the application of the Laws of any jurisdiction other than the State of Delaware. All actions and proceedings arising out of or relating to this Agreement shall be heard and determined in the Delaware Court of Chancery, and the Parties hereby irrevocably submit to the jurisdiction of such court in any such action or proceeding and irrevocably waive the defense of an inconvenient forum. Each Party irrevocably consents to the service of any and all process in any such action or proceeding by the mailing of copies of such process to such Party at its address specified in  _Section 12.4_. Nothing in this _Section 12.10_ shall affect the right of any Party to serve legal process in any other manner permitted by Law. The consents to jurisdiction set forth in this _Section 12.10_ shall not constitute general consents to service of process in the State of Delaware and shall have no effect for any purpose except as provided in this _Section 12.10_ and shall not be deemed to confer rights on any person other than the Parties. 

   

 (b) EACH PARTY ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES THAT ANY CONTROVERSY WHICH MAY ARISE UNDER THIS AGREEMENT IS LIKELY TO INVOLVE COMPLICATED AND DIFFICULT ISSUES, AND THEREFORE EACH SUCH PARTY HEREBY IRREVOCABLY AND UNCONDITIONALLY WAIVES ANY RIGHT SUCH PARTY MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN RESPECT OF ANY LITIGATION DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT, OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED BY THIS AGREEMENT. EACH PARTY CERTIFIES AND ACKNOWLEDGES THAT (i) NO REPRESENTATIVE, AGENT OR ATTORNEY OF ANY OTHER PARTY HAS REPRESENTED, EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE, THAT SUCH OTHER PARTY WOULD NOT, IN THE EVENT OF LITIGATION, SEEK TO ENFORCE THE FOREGOING WAIVER, (ii) EACH SUCH PARTY UNDERSTANDS AND HAS CONSIDERED THE IMPLICATIONS OF THIS WAIVER, (iii) EACH SUCH PARTY MAKES THIS WAIVER VOLUNTARILY, AND (iv) EACH SUCH PARTY HAS BEEN INDUCED TO ENTER INTO THIS AGREEMENT BY, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE MUTUAL WAIVERS AND CERTIFICATIONS IN THIS _SECTION 12.10(b)_. 

   

 Section 12.11 _No Third Party Beneficiaries_. Except as provided in _Section 8.10_, this Agreement shall be binding upon and inure solely to the benefit of the Parties and their permitted assigns and, except for the rights of the Indemnified Parties as set forth in _ARTICLE 10_ as to which they are expressly intended to be third-party beneficiaries, nothing herein, express or implied, is intended to or shall confer upon any other Person other than the Parties any legal or equitable right, benefit or remedy of any nature whatsoever (including any rights as a third party beneficiary or otherwise) under or by reason of this Agreement. 

  

 Section 12.12 _Amendment_. This Agreement may not be amended or supplemented in any and all respects except by an instrument in writing signed by the Parties. 

   ##### 

  

  

 Section 12.13 _Waiver_. Any Party may (a) extend the time for the performance of any of the obligations or other acts of any other Party, (b) waive any inaccuracies in the representations and warranties of another Party contained herein or in any document delivered by another Party pursuant hereto or (c) waive compliance with any of the agreements or conditions of another Party contained herein. Any such extension or waiver shall be valid only if set forth in an instrument in writing signed by the Party to be bound thereby. Any waiver of any term or condition shall not be construed as a waiver of any subsequent breach or a subsequent waiver of the same term or condition, or a waiver of any other term or condition, of this Agreement. The failure of any Party to assert any of its rights hereunder shall not constitute a waiver of any of such rights. 

  

 Section 12.14 _Equitable Relief_. The Parties agree that irreparable harm and significant damage, the amount of which would be difficult to estimate, would occur in the event that any of the provisions of this Agreement were not performed (or threatened to not be performed) in accordance with their specified terms or were otherwise breached (or threatened to be breached), thus making any remedy at Law or in damages inadequate. Accordingly, the Parties agree that they shall each be entitled to injunctive relief to prevent breaches (and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions) of this Agreement, including, without limitation, _Section 8.6_, without proof of actual damages and without any requirement for the securing or posting of any bond. Nothing herein shall be construed to limit the Parties respective rights to other remedies, which shall be in addition to those set forth in this provision. 

  

 Section 12.15 _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed in one or more counterparts, and by the Parties in separate counterparts, each of which when executed shall be deemed to be an original but all of which taken together shall constitute one and the same agreement. Facsimile signatures shall have the same force and effect as "ink" signatures. 

  

 Section 12.16 _Construction_. This Agreement and any documents or instruments delivered pursuant hereto shall be construed without regard to the identity of the Person who drafted the various provisions of the same. Each and every provision of this Agreement and such other documents and instruments reflects a negotiated outcome and as such shall be construed as though the Parties participated equally in the drafting of the same. Any rule of construction providing that a document or provision be construed against the drafting party shall not be applicable to this Agreement or such other documents and instruments. It is the intention of the Parties that, to the extent possible, unless provisions are mutually exclusive and effect cannot be given to both or all such provisions, the representations, warranties, covenants and closing conditions in this Agreement shall be construed to be cumulative and that each representation, warranty, covenant and closing condition in this Agreement shall be given full separate and independent effect and nothing set forth in the provisions herein shall in any way be deemed to limit the scope, applicability or effect of any other provision hereof. 

  

 Section 12.17 _Exhibits and Schedules to this Agreement_. All Annexes, Exhibits and Schedules hereto, or documents expressly incorporated into this Agreement, are hereby 

   ##### 

  

    

incorporated into this Agreement and are hereby made a part hereof as if set
out in this Agreement. 

  

 Section 12.18 _Time of the Essence_. Time is of the essence with respect to all dates and time periods set forth or referred to in this Agreement. The Parties acknowledge that each will be relying upon the timely performance by the other of its obligations hereunder as a material inducement to enter into this Agreement.
