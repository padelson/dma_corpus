warranties of another Party contained herein or in any document delivered by another Party pursuant
hereto or (c)&nbsp;waive compliance with any of the agreements or conditions of another Party contained
herein. Any such extension or waiver shall be valid only if set forth in an instrument in writing
signed by the Party to be bound thereby. Any waiver of any term or condition shall not be
construed as a waiver of any subsequent breach or a subsequent waiver of the same term or
condition, or a waiver of any other term or condition, of this Agreement. The failure of any Party

damage, the amount of which would be difficult to estimate, would occur in the event that any of
the provisions of this Agreement were not performed (or threatened to not be performed) in
accordance with their specified terms or were otherwise breached (or threatened to be breached),
thus making any remedy at Law or in damages inadequate. Accordingly, the Parties agree that they
shall each be entitled to injunctive relief to prevent breaches (and to enforce specifically the
terms and provisions) of this Agreement, including, without limitation, <U>Section&nbsp;8.6</U>,
without proof of actual damages and without any requirement for the securing or posting of any
bond. Nothing herein shall be construed to limit the Parties&#146; respective rights to other remedies,

pursuant hereto shall be construed without regard to the identity of the Person who drafted the
various provisions of the same. Each and every provision of this Agreement and such other
documents and instruments reflects a negotiated outcome and as such shall be construed as though
the Parties participated equally in the drafting of the same. Any rule of construction providing
that a document or provision be construed against the drafting party shall not be applicable to this Agreement or such
other documents and instruments. It is the intention of the Parties that, to the extent possible,
unless provisions are mutually exclusive and effect cannot be given to both or all such provisions,
the representations, warranties, covenants and closing conditions in this Agreement shall be
construed to be cumulative and that each representation, warranty, covenant and closing condition
in this Agreement shall be given full separate and independent effect and nothing set forth in the
provisions herein shall in any way be deemed to limit the scope, applicability or effect of any
other provision hereof.
