\- iii - AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER



This AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER, dated as of January 17, 2005 (this
_"Agreement"_ ), is made and entered into among Elekta AB (publ), a Swedish
corporation ( _"Parent"_ ), Erbium Acquisition Corporation, a Delaware
corporation and an indirect, wholly owned subsidiary of Parent ( _"Merger
Sub"_ ), and IMPAC Medical Systems, Inc., a Delaware corporation (
_"Company"_ ).



RECITALS:



A. The respective Boards of Directors of Parent, Merger Sub and Company have
determined that it would be advisable and in the best interests of their
respective stockholders for Parent to acquire Company, by means of a merger of
Merger Sub with and into Company (the _"Merger"_ ), on the terms and subject
to the conditions set forth in this Agreement.



B. Concurrently with the execution and delivery of this Agreement and as a
condition to Parents and Merger Subs willingness to enter into
this Agreement, Parent and Merger Sub have entered into Stockholder
Agreements, each dated as of the date hereof (the _"Stockholder Agreements"_
), with each of the Principal Stockholders (as defined in Section 8.3), in the
form attached hereto as _Exhibit A_ , pursuant to which each Principal
Stockholder has (x) agreed, among other things, to vote in favor of the
adoption of this Agreement and (y) granted to Parent an option to purchase all
Shares (as defined in Section 2.1(b)) owned by such Principal Stockholder.



C. Parent, Merger Sub and Company desire to make certain representations and
warranties and to enter into certain covenants in connection with the Merger
and also to prescribe various conditions to the consummation thereof;



NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the representations, warranties
and covenants contained in this Agreement, the parties hereto hereby agree as
follows:



ARTICLE I



THE MERGER 



Section 1.1 _The Merger_. On the terms and subject to the conditions set
forth in this Agreement, and in accordance with the Delaware General
Corporation Law (the _"DGCL"_ ), the Merger shall be effected and Merger Sub
shall be merged with and into Company at the Effective Time (as defined in
Section 1.3). At the Effective Time, the separate existence of Merger Sub
shall cease and Company shall continue as the surviving corporation (as such,
the _"Surviving Corporation"_ ).



Section 1.2 _Closing_. Unless this Agreement shall have been terminated and
the transactions contemplated hereby shall have been abandoned pursuant to
ARTICLE VII, and subject to the satisfaction or waiver of all of the
conditions set forth in ARTICLE VI, the closing of the Merger (the _"Closing"_
) will take place as soon as practicable, but in no event later than 10:00
a.m. on the second business day (the _"Closing Date"_ ) following satisfaction
or waiver of    all of the conditions set forth in ARTICLE VI, other than those conditions
that by their nature are to be satisfied at the Closing, but subject to
the fulfillment or waiver of those conditions, at the offices of Orrick,
Herrington and Sutcliffe LLP, 405 Howard Street, San Francisco, California
94105, unless another date, time or place is agreed to in writing by the
parties hereto.



Section 1.3 _Effective Time_. On the Closing Date (or on such other date as
Parent and Company may agree), the parties hereto shall file with the
Secretary of State of the State of Delaware (the _"Delaware State Secretary"_
) a certificate of merger and any other appropriate documents, executed
in accordance with the relevant provisions of the DGCL, and shall make all
other filings or recordings required under the DGCL in connection with the
Merger. The Merger shall become effective upon the filing of the certificate
of merger with the Delaware State Secretary, or at such later time as is
specified in the certificate of merger (the _"Effective Time"_ ).



Section 1.4 _Effects of the Merger_. The Merger shall have the effects set
forth in the applicable provisions of the DGCL. Without limiting
the generality of the foregoing, and subject thereto, at the Effective Time,
all property of Company and Merger Sub shall vest in the Surviving
Corporation, and all liabilities and obligations of Company and Merger Sub
shall become liabilities and obligations of the Surviving Corporation.



Section 1.5  _Certificate of Incorporation; Bylaws_. At the Effective Time,
(a) the certificate of incorporation of Merger Sub as in effect at the
Effective Time, a copy of which, as currently in effect, is in the form
attached hereto as _Exhibit B_  shall, from and after the Effective Time, be
the certificate of incorporation of the Surviving Corporation until thereafter
further changed or amended in accordance with the provisions thereof and
applicable law (except that the name of the Surviving Corporation immediately
after the Effective Time shall be the name of Company) and (b) the bylaws of
Merger Sub as in effect at the Effective Time, a copy of which, as currently
in effect, is in the form attached hereto as _Exhibit C_  shall, from and
after the Effective Time, be the bylaws of the Surviving Corporation until
thereafter changed or amended in accordance with the provisions thereof and
applicable law.



Section 1.6 _Directors; Officers_. From and after the Effective Time, (a) the
directors of Merger Sub shall be the directors of the Surviving Corporation,
until the earlier of their resignation or removal or until their respective
successors are duly elected and qualified, as the case may be, and (b) the
officers of Company shall be the officers of the Surviving Corporation, until
the earlier of their resignation or removal or until their respective
successors are duly elected and qualified, as the case may be.



Section 1.7 _Company Actions_. (a) Company hereby consents to the Merger and
represents and warrants that (i) its Board of Directors (at a meeting duly
called and held) acting unanimously has (A) determined that both of this
Agreement and the Merger are fair to and in the best interests of Company and
its stockholders, (B) approved and declared the advisability of this Agreement
and the transactions contemplated hereby, including the Merger (such approval
being sufficient to render Section 203 of the DGCL inapplicable to this
Agreement and the Stockholders Agreements, and the transactions contemplated
hereby and thereby, including the Merger), and (C) resolved (subject to the
limitations herein contained) to recommend adoption of this Agreement by the
holders of Shares, and (ii) William Blair and Company has delivered to the Board
of Directors of Company its opinion that the Merger Consideration to be
received by the holders of Shares in the Merger is fair, from a financial
point of view, to such holders.



 

\- 2 - Section 1.8 _Subsequent Actions_. If, at any time after the Effective Time,
the Surviving Corporation shall consider or be advised that any deeds, bills
of sale, assignments, assurances or any other actions or things are necessary
or desirable to vest, perfect or confirm of record or otherwise in the
Surviving Corporation its right, title or interest in, to or under any of the
rights, properties or assets of either of Company or Merger Sub acquired or to
be acquired by the Surviving Corporation as a result of, or in connection
with, the Merger or otherwise to carry out this Agreement, the officers and
directors of the Surviving Corporation shall be authorized to execute and
deliver, in the name and on behalf of either Company or Merger Sub, all such
deeds, bills of sale, assignments and assurances and to take and do, in the
name and on behalf of each of such corporations or otherwise, all such other
actions and things as may be necessary or desirable to vest, perfect or
confirm any and all right, title and interest in, to and under such rights,
properties or assets in the Surviving Corporation or otherwise to carry out
this Agreement.



ARTICLE II



EFFECT OF THE MERGER ON THE CAPITAL STOCK

OF THE CONSTITUENT CORPORATIONS; EXCHANGE OF CERTIFICATES



Section 2.1 _Effect on Capital Stock_. At the Effective Time, by virtue of the
Merger and without any action on the part of any holder of Shares or any
other shares of capital stock of Company or Merger Sub:



(a) _Common Stock of Merger Sub_. Each share of common stock, par value $0.01
per share, of Merger Sub issued and outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time shall be converted into and become one validly issued, fully
paid and nonassessable share of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of
the Surviving Corporation.



(b) _Conversion of Shares_. Each share of common stock, par value $.001 per
share (the _"Company Common Stock"_ ), of Company (collectively, the
_"Shares"_ ) issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time
(other than Shares to be canceled and retired in accordance with Section
2.1(c) and any Dissenting Shares (as defined in Section 2.1(d)) shall be
converted into the right to receive $24.00 per Share in cash, payable to the
holder thereof, without any interest thereon (the _"Merger Consideration"_ ),
less any required withholding taxes, upon surrender and exchange of a
Certificate (as defined in Section 2.3).



(c)  _Cancellation of Treasury Shares and Parent-Owned Shares_. Each Share
issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time that is owned
by Company or any Subsidiary of Company or by Parent, Merger Sub or any other
Subsidiary of Parent (other than shares in trust accounts, managed accounts,
custodial accounts and the like that are beneficially owned by third parties)
shall automatically be canceled and retired and shall cease to exist, and no
cash or other consideration shall be delivered or deliverable in exchange
therefor.



(d)  _Dissenting Shares_. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the
contrary, Shares issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective
Time held by any  



 

\- 3 -  person who has the right to demand, and who properly demands, an appraisal
of such Shares ( _"Dissenting Shares"_ ) in accordance with Section 262 of
the DGCL (or any successor provision) shall not be converted into a right to
receive the Merger Consideration unless such holder fails to perfect or
otherwise loses such holders right to such appraisal, if any. If, after
the Effective Time, such holder fails to perfect or loses any such right to
appraisal, each such Share of such holder shall be treated as a Share that had
been converted as of the Effective Time into the right to receive the Merger
Consideration in accordance with Section 2.1(b). At the Effective Time, any
holder of Dissenting Shares shall cease to have any rights with respect
thereto, except the rights provided in Section 262 of the DGCL (or any
successor provision) and as provided in the immediately preceding sentence.
Company shall give prompt notice to Parent of any demands received by Company
for appraisal of Shares, and Parent shall have the right to participate in and
direct all negotiations and proceedings with respect to such demands. Company
shall not, except with the prior written consent of Parent, make any payment
with respect to, or settle or offer to settle, any such demands.



 

Section 2.2 _Stock Options_.



(a) At the Effective Time, each then-outstanding option to purchase shares of
Company Common Stock (collectively, the _"Options"_ ) under Companys 1993
Stock Option Plan, as amended, 1998 Stock Option Plan, as amended, and 2002
Stock Plan, as amended (collectively, the _"Stock Option Plans"_ ), including
unvested Options, shall be cancelled (i) in the case of an Option having a
per share exercise price less than the Merger Consideration, for the right to
receive for each share of Company Common Stock subject to such Option
immediately prior to the Effective Time an amount (subject to any applicable
withholding tax) in cash equal to the product of (A) the number of shares of
Company Common Stock subject to such Option immediately prior to the Effective
Time and (B) the amount by which the Merger Consideration exceeds the per
share exercise price of such Option (such amount being hereinafter referred
to as the _"Option Consideration"_ ); or (ii) in the case of an Option having
a per share exercise price equal to or greater than the Merger
Consideration, without the payment of cash or issuance of other securities in
respect thereof. The cancellation of an Option as provided in the immediately
preceding sentence shall be deemed a release of any and all rights the holder
thereof had or may have had in respect of such Option. Company shall take
such actions as may be necessary to accelerate all Options that are not vested
Options as of the Effective Time.



(b) Prior to the Effective Time, Company shall take such actions as may be
necessary to give effect to the transactions contemplated by this Section
2.2, including, but not limited to, satisfaction of the requirements of Rule
16b-3(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (together with
the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder, the _"Exchange Act"_ ). 



(c) Except as otherwise agreed to by the parties, (i) the Stock Option Plans
shall terminate as of the Effective Time and the provisions in any other plan,
program or arrangement providing for the issuance or grant of any other
interest in respect of the capital stock of Company or any Subsidiary
thereof shall be canceled as of the Effective Time and (ii) Company shall
insure that following the Effective Time no participant in the Stock Option
Plans or other plans, programs or arrangements shall have any right thereunder
to acquire any equity securities of Company, the Surviving Corporation or any
Subsidiary thereof and to terminate all such plans.



 

\- 4 - (d) Company shall take all actions necessary pursuant to the terms of the
Company ESPP (as defined in Section 8.3) to shorten each currently ongoing
purchase and/or offering period under such plan which extends beyond the
Effective Time (the _"Current Offerings"_ ) such that a new purchase date for
each such Current Offering shall occur prior to the Effective Time and shares
shall be purchased by Company ESPP participants prior to the Effective Time.
The Company ESPP shall terminate immediately prior to the earlier of (i) the
Effective Time or (ii) the date upon which the Company ESPP terminates by its
terms. Subsequent to the date of this Agreement, Company shall take no action,
pursuant to the terms of the Company ESPP, to commence any new purchase and/or
offering period.



Section 2.3 _Payment for Shares_.



(a) _Payment Fund_. When and as needed, Parent shall deposit, or shall cause
to be deposited, with or for the account of EquiServe Trust Company, N.A. or
another entity as reasonably designated by Parent (the _"Paying Agent"_ ), for
the benefit of the holders of Shares, cash in an amount sufficient to pay the
aggregate Merger Consideration payable upon the conversion of Shares pursuant
to Section 2.1(b) (the _"Payment Fund"_ ).



(b) _Letters of Transmittal; Surrender of Certificates_. As soon as reasonably
practicable after the Effective Time, Parent shall instruct the Paying Agent
to mail to each holder of record (other than Company or any of its
Subsidiaries or Parent, Merger Sub or any other Subsidiary of Parent) of a
certificate or certificates that, immediately prior to the Effective Time,
evidenced outstanding Shares (the _"Certificates"_ ), (i) a form of letter of
transmittal (which shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of
loss and title to the Certificates shall pass, only upon proper delivery of
the Certificates to the Paying Agent, and shall be in such form and have such
other provisions as Parent may reasonably specify) and (ii) instructions for
use in effecting the surrender of the Certificates in exchange for the Merger
Consideration. Upon surrender of a Certificate for cancellation to the Paying
Agent together with such letter of transmittal, duly executed, and such other
customary documents as may be required pursuant to such instructions, the
holder of such Certificate shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor
cash in an amount equal to the product of (i) the number of Shares theretofore
represented by such Certificate and (ii) the Merger Consideration, and the
Certificate so surrendered shall forthwith be canceled. No interest shall be
paid or accrued on any cash payable upon the surrender of any Certificate. If
payment is to be made to a person other than the person in whose name the
surrendered Certificate is registered, it shall be a condition of payment
that the Certificate so surrendered shall be properly endorsed or otherwise
in proper form for transfer and that the person requesting such payment shall
pay any transfer or other taxes required by reason of the payment to a person
other than the registered holder of the surrendered Certificate or
established to the satisfaction of Parent and the Surviving Corporation that
such taxes have been paid or are not applicable.



(c) _No Further Transfers on Company Record Books_. At the Effective Time, the
stock transfer books of Company shall be closed and there shall not be any
further registration of transfers of any shares of capital stock thereafter on
the records of Company. If, at or after the Effective Time, Certificates are
presented to the Surviving Corporation, they shall  



 

\- 5 -  be canceled and exchanged for cash as provided in Section 2.1(b). No
interest shall accrue or be paid on any cash payable upon the surrender of a
Certificate or Certificates which immediately before the Effective Time
represented issued and outstanding Shares.



(d) _Lost Certificates_. In the event any Certificate has been lost, stolen or
destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the
person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed, the Paying
Agent will issue in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate
the Merger Consideration deliverable in respect thereof as determined in
accordance with Section 2.1(b); provided, however, that the Surviving
Corporation or the Paying Agent may, in its discretion and as a condition
precedent to the payment thereof, require the record holder of such
Certificate to give the Surviving Corporation a bond in such sum as the
Surviving Corporation may reasonably direct or otherwise to indemnify the
Surviving Corporation in a manner reasonably satisfactory to it against any
claim that may be made against the Surviving Corporation with respect to the
Certificate claimed to have been lost, stolen or destroyed.



(e)  _Cancellation and Retirement of Shares; No Further Rights_. As of the
Effective Time, all Shares (other than Shares to be canceled in accordance
with Section 2.1(c)) issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective
Time shall cease to be outstanding and shall automatically be canceled and
retired and shall cease to exist, and each holder of any such Shares shall
cease to have any rights with respect thereto or arising therefrom (including
without limitation the right to vote), except the right to receive the Merger
Consideration, without interest, upon surrender of such Certificate in
accordance with Section 2.3(b), and until so surrendered, each such
Certificate shall represent for all purposes only the right to receive the
Merger Consideration, without interest. The Merger Consideration paid upon the
surrender for exchange of Certificates in accordance with the terms of this
Section 2.3 shall be deemed to have been paid in full satisfaction of all
rights pertaining to the Shares theretofore represented by such Certificates.



(f) _Investment of Payment Fund_. The Paying Agent shall invest the Payment
Fund, as directed by Parent, in (i) direct obligations of the United States of
America, (ii) obligations for which the full faith and credit of the
United States of America is pledged to provide for the payment of principal
and interest, (iii) commercial paper rated the highest quality by either
Moodys Investors Services, Inc. or Standard and Poors Corporation, or (iv)
certificates of deposit, bank repurchase agreements or bankers acceptances
of commercial banks with capital exceeding $500 million. Any net earnings with
respect to the Payment Fund shall be the property of and paid over to Parent
as and when requested by Parent.



(g) _Termination of Payment Fund_. Any portion of the Payment Fund which
remains undistributed to the holders of Certificates for 180 days after the
Effective Time shall be delivered to Parent, upon demand, and any holders of
Certificates that have not theretofore complied with this Section 2.3 shall
thereafter look only to Parent, and only as general creditors thereof, for
payment of their claim for any Merger Consideration.



(h) _No Liability_. None of Parent, Merger Sub, the Surviving Corporation or
the Paying Agent shall be liable to any person in respect of any payments or
distributions payable from the Payment Fund delivered to a public official
pursuant to any applicable  



 

\- 6 -  abandoned property, escheat or similar law. If any Certificates shall not
have been surrendered prior to five years after the Effective Time (or
immediately prior to such earlier date on which any Merger Consideration in
respect of such Certificate would otherwise escheat to or become the property
of any Governmental Entity (as defined in Section 3.1(c)), any amounts payable
in respect of such Certificate shall, to the extent permitted by applicable
law, become the property of the Surviving Corporation, free and clear of all
claims or interest of any person previously entitled thereto.



(i) _Withholding Rights_. Parent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold, or
cause to be deducted or withheld, from the consideration otherwise payable
pursuant to this Agreement to any holder of Shares, Options or Certificates
such amounts as are required to be deducted and withheld with respect to the
making of such payment under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended
(the _"Code"_ ), or any provision of applicable state, local or foreign tax
law. To the extent that amounts are so deducted and withheld, such deducted
and withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as
having been paid to such holders in respect of which such deduction and
withholding was made.



ARTICLE III



REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES



Section 3.1 _Representations and Warranties of Company_. Company represents
and warrants to Parent and Merger Sub as follows, subject to the exceptions
specifically disclosed in writing in the disclosure schedule (referencing the
applicable paragraph and section of this ARTICLE III) supplied by Company to
Parent on or prior to, and dated as of, the date hereof and certified by a
duly authorized officer of Company (the _"Disclosure Schedule"_ ), which
Disclosure Schedule shall provide an exception to or otherwise qualify only
the representations and warranties of Company contained in the paragraph of
this Article III corresponding to such disclosure:

qualified or licensed to do business and is in good standing in each
jurisdiction in which the nature of its business or the ownership or leasing

Material Adverse Effect (as defined in Section 8.3) on Company. Company has
delivered or made available to Parent true, complete and correct copies of
the certificate of incorporation and bylaws or comparable governing documents
of Company and each Subsidiary of Company, in each case as amended to the date
of this Agreement. A true, correct and complete list of all Subsidiaries of

under, or require the consent of any person under, any indenture, or other
agreement, permit, concession, franchise, license or similar instrument or
undertaking to which Parent or Merger Sub is a party or by which Parent or
Merger Sub or any of their respective assets is bound or affected, or

Sub in connection with the execution and delivery of this Agreement by Parent

states in which Company is qualified to do business, and (iv) any other
consents, approvals, authorizations, filings or notices the failure to make
or obtain which could not reasonably be expected to have, individually or in
the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on Parent.



(d) _Certain Information_. None of the information supplied or to be supplied
by Parent or Merger Sub in writing for inclusion or incorporation by reference
in, or which may be deemed to be incorporated by reference in, the Proxy
Statement will, at the time the Proxy Statement is filed with the SEC or
published, sent or given to Companys stockholders, contain any untrue
statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be

with its incorporation or organization or the negotiation and consummation of
this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby, Merger Sub has not
incurred any obligations or liabilities, and has not engaged in any business

Company or any of its Subsidiaries), to, directly or indirectly, initiate,
solicit or encourage (including by way of furnishing information) any
Acquisition Proposal (as defined in Section 5.5(d)), or enter into or maintain
or continue discussions or negotiations with any person in furtherance of,
furnish any information to any other person with respect to, or approve, agree
to, endorse or recommend, any Acquisition Proposal; provided, however, that
nothing in this Agreement shall prohibit the Board of Directors of Company,
prior to the consummation of the Merger, from furnishing the same information
as was previously furnished to Parent (as revised or updated to reflect any
changes or additions to such information if such revised information
is contemporaneously furnished to Parent) to, or entering into, maintaining
or continuing discussions or negotiations with, any person that makes an
unsolicited bona fide written Acquisition Proposal after the date hereof under
circumstances not involving any breach of the provisions of this Section
5.5(a) if, and to the extent that, (i) the Board of Directors of Company,
after consultation with and based upon the advice of independent legal
counsel, reasonably determines in good faith that the failure to take such
action would be reasonably likely to constitute a breach by the Board of
Directors of Company of its fiduciary duties to Companys stockholders under
applicable law, (ii) the Board of Directors of Company, after consultation
with and based upon the advice of its financial advisor, reasonably determines
in  



 

\- 27 -  good faith that the Acquisition Proposal is a Superior Proposal, and (iii)
prior to furnishing any non-public information to such person, Company
receives from such person an executed confidentiality agreement with
provisions no less favorable to Company than the Confidentiality Agreement.
Company shall promptly (and, in any event within 24 hours) notify Parent after
receipt of any Acquisition Proposal or any request for information relating
to Company or any of its Subsidiaries or for access to the properties, books
or records of Company or any of its Subsidiaries by any person who has
informed Company that such person is considering making, or has made, an
Acquisition Proposal (which notice shall identify the person making, or
considering making, such Acquisition Proposal and shall set forth the material
terms of any Acquisition Proposal received), and Company shall keep
Parent informed in reasonable detail of the terms, status and other pertinent
details of any such Acquisition Proposal.



(b) Neither the Board of Directors of Company nor any committee thereof shall
(i) withdraw or modify, or propose publicly to withdraw or modify, in
a manner adverse to Parent or Merger Sub, the approval of this Agreement or

recommend, or propose publicly to approve or recommend, any Acquisition
Proposal, or (iii) cause Company to enter into any letter of intent, agreement
in principle, acquisition agreement or other similar agreement related to any

Agreement will prohibit the Board of Directors of Company from, prior to the
consummation of the Merger, taking any of the actions set forth in clauses (i)
or (ii) above following the receipt by Company of an unsolicited bona fide
written Acquisition Proposal after the date hereof under circumstances not
involving any breach of the provisions of Section 5.5(a) if, and to the extent
that, (i) the Board of Directors of Company, after consultation with
and based upon the advice of independent legal counsel, reasonably determines
in good faith that the failure to take such action would be reasonably likely
to constitute a breach by the Board of Directors of Company of its fiduciary
duties to Companys stockholders under applicable law, (ii) the Board of
Directors of Company, after consultation with and based upon the advice of its
financial advisor, determines in good faith that the Acquisition Proposal is a
Superior Proposal and (iii) (x) at least three business days have elapsed
following the delivery to Parent of a written notice of such determinations by
the Board of Directors of Company and (1) Company has delivered to Parent the
written notice required by the last sentence of Section 5.5(a) and (2) during
such three business day period, Company shall provide Parent the opportunity
to make a counter-proposal to such Superior Proposal and shall consider in
good faith the terms of such counter-proposal and engage in good faith
negotiations regarding such counter-proposal so as would enable Parent to
proceed with the Merger on such adjusted terms and (y) at the end of such
three business day period the Board of Directors of Company continues
reasonably to believe that the Acquisition Proposal constitutes a Superior
Proposal.



(c) Nothing in this Section 5.5, and no action taken by the Board of Directors
of Company pursuant to this Section 5.5, will (i) permit Company to enter into
any agreement providing for any transaction contemplated by an Acquisition
Proposal for as long as this Agreement remains in effect or (ii) affect in any
manner any other obligation of Company under this Agreement. Nothing in this
Section 5.5 shall prohibit the Company or its Board of Directors from
taking and disclosing to its stockholders a position in which it rejects a
third-party tender offer and the reason therefor pursuant to Rules 14d-9 and
14e2(a) promulgated under the Exchange Act.

involving at least two-thirds of the shares of capital stock or all or

the Merger in response to an Acquisition Proposal) and is reasonably likely
of being completed.



(e) Company shall immediately terminate, and shall cause its subsidiaries and
its and their respective directors, officers, employees, investment bankers,

reasonable efforts to obtain all licenses, permits, consents, approvals,

the consummation of the Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby
and to fulfill the conditions to the Merger (and avoidance of breach or
default under such contracts); provided, however, that in no event shall

permitted under applicable law, cause the Surviving Corporation to fulfill
and honor in all respects the obligations of Company pursuant to any
indemnification agreements between Company and its officers and directors in
effect prior to the date of this Agreement.

and officers liability insurance policy for a period of six years after the
Effective Time, for the benefit of those persons who are covered by Companys
directors and officers liability insurance policies at the Effective
Time, providing coverage with respect to matters occurring prior to the
Effective Time that is at least equal to the coverage provided under Companys
current directors and officers liability insurance policies, for such
premium and on such terms and conditions heretofore described to Parent, and
shall not modify, amend or otherwise alter such terms and conditions without
the prior written consent of Parent, which consent shall not be withheld
unreasonably. In the event that such run-on policy is not available, the
Surviving Corporation shall cause to be maintained in effect policies of
directors and officers liability insurance for six years after the Effective
Time providing such coverage to such persons at an annual cost not greater
than 150 percent of the premium for the current Company directors and
officers liability insurance policies; provided that if such insurance cannot
be so maintained at such cost, the Surviving Corporation shall maintain as
much of such insurance as can be so maintained at a cost equal to 150 percent
of the current annual premiums of Company for such insurance.



(c) In the event that Parent or the Surviving Corporation or any of their
respective successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any
other person and shall not be the continuing or surviving corporation or
entity of such consolidation or merger, or (ii) transfers all or substantially
all of its properties and assets to any person in a single transaction or a
series of transactions, then, and in each such case, Parent or the Surviving
Corporation, as applicable, shall make or cause to be made proper provision so
that the successors and assigns of Parent or the Surviving Corporation, as
applicable, assume by operation of law the obligations of Parent or the
Surviving Corporation, as applicable, under this Section 5.8 for the benefit
of the Indemnified Parties.



(d) This Section 5.8 is intended to be for the benefit of, and shall be
enforceable by the Indemnified Parties and their heirs and

Corporation and its successors and assigns.

(including derivative securities with respect to Company Common Stock)
resulting from the transactions contemplated by this Agreement by each
individual who is subject to the reporting requirements of Section 16(a) of
the Exchange Act with respect to Company to be exempt under Rule 16b-3

Section 8.5  _Interpretation_. When a reference is made in this Agreement to
an Article or a Section, such reference shall be to an Article or a Section of
this Agreement unless otherwise indicated. The table of contents and headings
contained in this Agreement are for convenience of reference purposes only
and shall not affect in any way the meaning or interpretation of this
Agreement. Whenever the words "include", "includes" or "including" are used in
this Agreement, they shall be deemed to be followed by the words "without
limitation".



Section 8.6 _Entire Agreement; Third-Party Beneficiaries_. This Agreement, the

agreement and understanding of the parties hereto, and supersede (i) all
prior agreements and understandings, both written and oral, among the parties
with respect to the subject matter hereof and thereof and (ii) any information
provided by any party to any other party to this Agreement. This Agreement is
not intended to confer upon any person (including without limitation any
employees or former employees or stockholders of Company), other than the
parties hereto, any rights or remedies.



Section 8.7 _Governing Law_. This Agreement shall be governed by,
and construed in accordance with, the laws of the State of Delaware,
regardless of the laws that might otherwise govern under applicable principles
of conflicts of laws thereof.



Section 8.8 _Assignment_. Neither this Agreement nor any of the rights,
interests or obligations under this Agreement may be assigned or delegated,
in whole or in part, by operation of law or otherwise by any of the parties
without the prior written consent of the other parties, and any such
assignment without such prior written consent shall be null and void, except
that Parent and/or Merger Sub may assign this Agreement to any direct or

Company; provided that Parent and/or Merger Sub, as the case may be, shall
remain liable for all of its obligations under this Agreement. Subject to the
preceding sentence, this Agreement will be binding upon, inure to the benefit
of, and be enforceable by, the parties and their respective successors and
assigns.



Section 8.9 _Enforcement_. Irreparable damage would occur in the event that
any of the provisions of this Agreement were not performed in accordance with
their specific terms or were  



 

\- 39 -  otherwise breached. Accordingly, the parties shall be entitled to an
injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to
enforce specifically the terms and provisions of this Agreement in the Court
of Chancery in and for New Castle County in the State of Delaware (or, if such
court lacks subject matter jurisdiction, any appropriate state or federal
court in New Castle County in the State of Delaware), this being in addition
to any other remedy to which they are entitled at law or in equity. Each of
the parties hereto (i) shall submit itself to the personal jurisdiction of the
Court of Chancery in and for New Castle County in the State of Delaware (or,
if such court lacks subject matter jurisdiction, any appropriate state or
federal court in New Castle County in the State of Delaware) in the event any
dispute arises out of this Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated
hereby, (ii) shall not attempt to deny or defeat such personal jurisdiction by
motion or other request for leave from any such court, and (iii) shall not
bring any action relating to this Agreement or any of the transactions
contemplated hereby in any court other than the Court of Chancery in and for
New Castle County in the State of Delaware (or, if such court lacks subject
matter jurisdiction, any appropriate state or federal court in New Castle
County in the State of Delaware).



Section 8.10 _Submission to Jurisdiction_. By execution and delivery of this
Agreement, Parent acknowledges that it has, by separate written instrument,
appointed and designated, without power of revocation, Corporation Service
Company, with offices on the date hereof located at 1133 Avenue of the
Americas, Suite 3100, New York, New York 10036, United States (and any
successor entity) as its authorized agent (the _"Authorized Agent"_ ) to
accept and acknowledge on its behalf, until the sixth anniversary of the
Effective Time, service of any and all process which may be served in any
claim in any way relating to or arising out of this Agreement or the
transactions contemplated hereby brought in any Delaware State or U.S. Federal
court located in New Castle County in the State of Delaware. Such service may
be made by delivering a copy of such process to Parent in care of the
Authorized Agent at the address specified above for the Authorized Agent and
obtaining a receipt therefor, and Parent hereby irrevocably authorizes and
directs the Authorized Agent to accept such service on its behalf. Parent
represents and warrants that the Authorized Agent has agreed to act as said
agent for service of process, and agrees that service of process in such
manner upon the Authorized Agent shall be deemed to the fullest extent
permitted by applicable law, in every respect effective service of process
upon Parent in any claim. Parent further agrees to take any and all
action, including the execution and filing of any and all such documents and
instruments, as may be necessary to continue such designation and appointment
of the Authorized Agent in full force and effect.



Section 8.11 _Severability_. Whenever possible, each provision or portion of
any provision of this Agreement shall be interpreted in such manner as to be
effective and valid under applicable law, but if any provision or portion of
any provision of this Agreement is held to be invalid, illegal or
unenforceable in any respect under any applicable law or rule in any
jurisdiction, such invalidity, illegality or unenforceability shall not affect
any other provision or portion of any provision in such jurisdiction, and this
Agreement shall be reformed, construed and enforced in such jurisdiction as
if such invalid, illegal or unenforceable provision or portion of any
provision had never been contained herein.



Section 8.12 _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed in one or more
counterparts, all of which shall be considered one and the same
instrument and shall become effective when one or more counterparts have been
signed by each of the parties and delivered to the other parties.
