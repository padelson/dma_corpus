which amounts shall be disbursed by the Company to the applicable Taxing

and be forfeited for no consideration. At or prior to the Closing Date, the
Company, the Board of Directors or the compensation committee of the Board

duly endorsed or accompanied by stock powers duly endorsed in blank, with any

Share_ " shall mean (i) the sum of (A) the Purchase Price _minus_ the Escrow
Amount and (B) the Aggregate Vested Option Exercise Price, _divided_ _by_ (ii)
the Aggregate Fully-Diluted Common Shares. Subject to the adjustments set
forth in _Section 2.4_, the " _Purchase Price_ " shall consist of

with _Annex B_. Prior to the Closing, the Company shall provide Acquiror and
its representatives reasonable access to the records, properties and personnel
of the Company and its Subsidiaries relating to the preparation of the
Estimated Closing Statement.

2.4 _Adjustment Amount_

 

(a) As soon as reasonably practicable following the Closing Date, and in any
event within 90 calendar days thereof, Acquiror shall prepare and deliver to
the Holder Representative (i) an unaudited consolidated balance sheet of the
Company and its Subsidiaries (the " _Closing Balance Sheet_ "), (ii) a
calculation of Net Working Capital (" _Closing Date Net Working Capital_ "),
(iii) a calculation of the aggregate amount of all Funded Debt of the Company
(" _Closing Date Funded Debt_ "), (iv) a calculation of Cash and Cash
Equivalents of the Company (" _Closing Date Cash_ ") and (v) if applicable, a
calculation of Outstanding Company Expenses not paid by Acquiror at Closing in
accordance with _Section 2.6_ (" _Additional Outstanding Company Expenses_
"), in each case, calculated as of the close of business on the Business Day
immediately preceding the Closing Date. The Closing Date Net Working Capital
shall be prepared in accordance with _Annex B_ (and without any change in any
reserves, or introduction of any new reserves, from the reserves included in
the calculation of the Estimated Closing Statement). If Acquirors calculation
of Closing Date Net Working Capital, Closing Date Funded Debt, Closing Date
Cash and Additional Outstanding Company Expenses results in a calculation of
the Adjustment Amount that is a positive number, Acquiror and the Holder
Representative shall immediately deliver joint written instruction to the
Escrow Agent instructing the Escrow Agent to pay to each Holder an amount in
cash equal to (i) the Adjustment Escrow Funds, _multiplied_ _by_ (ii) such
Holders Escrow Percentage. In addition, Acquiror shall pay to each Holder an
amount in cash equal to (i) such Holders Escrow Percentage, _multiplied_
_by_ (ii) Acquirors calculation of the Adjustment Amount. If Acquirors
calculation of Closing Date Net Working Capital, Closing Date Funded Debt,
Closing Date Cash and Additional Outstanding Company Expenses results in a
calculation of the Adjustment Amount that is a negative number and such
calculation of the Adjustment Amount is less than the amount of the Adjustment
Escrow Funds, Acquiror and the Holder Representative shall immediately
deliver joint written instruction to the Escrow Agent instructing the Escrow
Agent to pay to each Holder an amount in cash equal to (i) the excess of the
entire Adjustment Escrow Funds over Acquirors calculation of the Adjustment
Amount, _multiplied_ _by_ (ii) such Holders Escrow Percentage (it being
understood and agreed that such payment shall not limit the rights of the
Holder Representative pursuant to this _Section 2.4(a)_). Following the
Closing, Acquiror shall provide the Holder Representative and its
representatives reasonable access to the records, properties and personnel of
the Company and its Subsidiaries relating to the preparation of the Closing
Balance Sheet and shall cause the personnel of the Company and its
Subsidiaries to reasonably cooperate with the Holder Representative in
connection with its review of the Closing Balance Sheet.

 

(b) If the Holder Representative shall disagree with the calculation of
Closing Date Net Working Capital, Closing Date Funded Debt, Closing Date Cash
and/or Additional Outstanding Company Expenses it shall notify Acquiror of
such disagreement in writing, setting forth in reasonable detail the
particulars of such disagreement, within 60 days after its receipt of 

 



15  the Closing Balance Sheet. In the event that the Holder Representative does
not provide such a notice of disagreement within such 60-day period, the
Holder Representative shall be deemed to have accepted the Closing Balance
Sheet and the calculation of Closing Date Net Working Capital, Closing Date
Funded Debt, Closing Date Cash and/or Additional Outstanding Company Expenses
delivered by Acquiror, which shall be final, binding and conclusive for all
purposes hereunder. In the event any such notice of disagreement is timely
provided, Acquiror and the Holder Representative shall use reasonable best
efforts for a period of 30 days (or such longer period as they may
mutually agree) to resolve any disagreements with respect to the calculations
of Closing Date Net Working Capital, Closing Date Funded Debt, Closing Date
Cash and/or Additional Outstanding Company Expenses. If, at the end of such
period, they are unable to resolve such disagreements, then Deloitte and Touche
LLP (or such other independent accounting or financial consulting firm of
recognized national standing as may be mutually selected by Acquiror and the
Holder Representative) (the " _Independent Accountant_ ") shall resolve any
remaining disagreements. Each of Acquiror and the Holder Representative shall
promptly provide their assertions regarding any disputes relating to the
Closing Date Net Working Capital, Closing Date Funded Debt, Closing Date Cash
and/or Additional Outstanding Company Expenses, and, to the extent relevant
thereto, the Closing Balance Sheet in writing to the Independent Accountant
and to each other. The Independent Accountant shall be instructed to render
its determination with respect to such disagreements as soon as reasonably
practicable (which the parties hereto agree should not be later than 45 days
following the day on which the disagreement is referred to the Independent
Accountant). The Independent Accountant shall (i) base its determination
solely on the written submissions of the parties and shall not conduct an
independent investigation and (ii) consider only those items or amounts
relating to the Closing Date Net Working Capital, Closing Date Funded Debt,
Closing Date Cash and/or Additional Outstanding Company Expenses, as to which
the Holder Representative timely disagreed, in accordance with this _Section
2.4(b)_ and (iii) use the definitions of the defined terms used in this
_Section 2.4_ provided in this Agreement. With respect to each disputed item,
the Independent Accountants determination, if not in accordance with the
position of either Acquiror or the Holder Representative, shall not be in
excess of the higher, nor less than the lower, of the amounts presented in
Acquirors calculation of Closing Date Net Working Capital, Closing Date
Funded Debt, Closing Date Cash and/or Additional Outstanding Company Expenses
pursuant to _Section 2.4(a)_ or in the Holder Representatives written
disagreement of any such calculation pursuant to this _Section 2.4(b)_. The
determination of the Independent Accountant shall be final, conclusive and
binding on the parties and no party shall seek further recourse to any
Governmental Authority other than to enforce the determination of the
Independent Accountant. The parties acknowledge that the agreements contained
in this _Section 2.4_ are an integral part of the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement, and that, without these agreements, the parties would not
enter into this Agreement. If Acquiror fails promptly to pay any Adjustment
Amount that may be payable to the Holders in accordance with this _Section
2.4_, and, in order to obtain such payment, the Holder Representative
commences an Action that results in a judgment against Acquiror for
such Adjustment Amount, Acquiror shall pay to the Holders, together with such
Adjustment Amount, in accordance with _Section 2.4(d),_ (a) interest on such
Adjustment Amount (or portion thereof) which shall accrue from the date such
amount should have been paid pursuant this _Section 2.4_ until the date such
amount is paid to Holders at a rate per annum equal to the prime rate as
published in the Wall Street Journal, Eastern Edition, in effect on the date
hereof and (b) any fees, costs and expenses (including legal fees) incurred
by the Holder

 



16  Representative in connection with any such Action. The date on which Closing
Date Net Working Capital, Closing Date Funded Debt, Closing Date Cash and
Additional Outstanding Company Expenses, are finally determined in accordance
with this _Section 2.4(b)_ is hereinafter referred to as the " _Determination
Date_." All fees and expenses of the Independent Accountant relating to the
work, if any, to be performed by the Independent Accountant hereunder shall
be borne one-half by Acquiror and one-half by the Holder Representative, as a
Holder Allocable Expense.

 

(c) If the Adjustment Amount is a positive number, then the Purchase Price
shall be increased by the Adjustment Amount, and if the Adjustment Amount is
a negative number, the Purchase Price shall be decreased by the absolute value
of the Adjustment Amount. The Adjustment Amount shall be paid in accordance
with _Section 2.4(a)_ and _Section 2.4(d)_.

the Determination Date, and in any event within five (5) Business Days of the
Determination Date, (x) Acquiror shall pay to the Holder Representative (for
further distribution to the Holders) an amount in cash equal to the Adjustment
Amount, less any portion of the Adjustment Amount previously paid by Acquiror
to the Holders pursuant to _Section 2.4(a)_, and (y) the Escrow Agent shall
pay to each Holder an amount in cash equal to (i) the Adjustment Escrow Funds,
_multiplied_ _by_ (ii) such Holders Escrow Percentage, less any portion of
the Adjustment Escrow Funds previously paid by the Escrow Agent to such Holder
pursuant to _Section 2.4(a)_. If the Adjustment Amount is a negative number
(the absolute value of such amount, the " _Deficit Amount_ "), then, promptly
following the Determination Date, and in any event within five Business Days
of the Determination Date, (x) the Escrow Agent shall pay to Acquiror an
amount of Adjustment Escrow Funds equal to the Deficit Amount and, if the
Deficit Amount is in excess of the Adjustment Escrow Funds, then the Escrow
Agent shall pay such excess amount from the Indemnification Escrow Funds
(subject to the last sentence of this  _Section 2.4(d)_), and (y) if any of
the Adjustment Escrow Funds remain after such payment to Acquiror, the Escrow
Agent shall pay to each Holder an amount in cash equal to (i) the balance of
the Adjustment Escrow Funds,  _multiplied_ _by_ (ii) such Holders Escrow
Percentage, less any portion of the Adjustment Escrow Funds previously paid by
the Escrow Agent to such Holder pursuant to _Section 2.4(a)_. Upon
determination of the Adjustment Amount pursuant to _Section 2.4(b)_ and
_Section 2.4(c)_, each of Acquiror and the Holder Representative shall
execute joint written instructions to the Escrow Agent instructing the Escrow
Agent to disburse the Adjustment Escrow Funds in accordance with this
_Section 2.4(d)_. In no event shall the Holder Representative or any Holder
have any liability under this _Section 2.4_ in excess of such Holders Escrow
Percentage of the Escrow Funds. In no event shall Acquiror be entitled to
payment pursuant to this _Section 2.4(d)_ of any amount in excess of the
Escrow Funds.

the Holder Representative a cash amount equal to $500,000 (the " _Holder

of Net Working Capital or Funded Debt with respect to liabilities for the
Holder Allocable Expenses.

 



17 2.6 _Outstanding Company Expenses_. On or prior to the Closing Date, the
Company shall provide to Acquiror a written report setting forth a list of
the third-party fees and expenses incurred or payable by the Company or its

Representative, by wire transfer of immediately available funds an amount
equal to the Outstanding Company Expenses. No amount shall be included on the
Closing Balance Sheet or in any calculation of Net Working Capital or Funded
Debt with respect to liabilities for the Outstanding Company Expenses paid in

shall apply such cash to pay all amounts owing under the Credit Agreements
outstanding on the Closing Date immediately prior to the Closing and (c) the
Company shall cause (i) each of its Subsidiaries to be fully and irrevocably

immediately prior to the Closing to deliver to Acquiror (A) payoff letters (or
other evidence in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to Acquiror) with
respect to all of the amounts outstanding on the Closing Date immediately
prior to the Closing evidencing the satisfaction of all liabilities (other
than Continuing Obligations) thereunder upon receipt of the amounts set forth
therein and (B) releases in customary forms concurrently with the repayment
of obligations giving rise thereto of all Liens with respect to the capital
stock, property and assets of the Company and its Subsidiaries relating to
such amounts.

 

2.8 _Withholding_. Notwithstanding any other provision in this Agreement to
the contrary, any amounts payable in connection with the
transactions contemplated hereby will be reduced by any Tax withholding that
may be required by Law, and any amount so withheld in compliance with
applicable Law will be treated for all purposes hereof as having been paid to
the Person with respect to which the withholding was made. Any Person that
expects to so withhold (or expects its agent to so withhold) any such Tax
(other than any backup withholding or any such Tax that is imposed on
consideration that is properly treated as compensation for U.S. federal
income Tax purposes) will provide reasonable notice of the expected
withholding prior to the withholding to the Person with respect to which the
withholding is to be made, and the parties hereto will use

 



18  reasonable efforts to cooperate to minimize the amount of the withholding.
In the case of any such payment treated as compensation, the parties shall
cooperate to pay such amounts through the Companys payroll to facilitate
applicable withholding.

request; _provided_ , _however_ , that (a) Acquiror shall not without the
prior written consent of Holder Representative be permitted as part of such

efforts to obtain, not less than three Business Days prior to the Closing
Date, from each Person to whom any payment or benefit is required or proposed
to be made that could constitute a "parachute payment" (as defined in Section
280G(b)(2) of the Code) a written agreement waiving such Persons right to
receive some or all of such payment or benefit (the " _Waived Benefit_ ") so
that all remaining payment or benefit applicable to such Person shall not be
deemed to be a parachute payment that would not be deductible under Section
280G of the Code, and to accept in substitution for the Waived Benefit the
right to receive such remaining payment or benefit only if approved by the
stockholders of the Company in a manner that complies with Section
280G(b)(5)(B) of the Code. As soon as practicable thereafter but in any event
prior to the Closing Date, the Company shall seek stockholder approval in a
manner that complies with Section 280G(b)(5)(B) of the Code of all such
payments that have been conditioned on the receipt of such approval. Prior to

date of the statement, "United States real property interests."

 

6.7 _No Solicit_. Beginning on the Closing Date and ending on the second
anniversary thereof, the Holder Representative agrees that it shall not,
and shall cause its controlled Affiliates not to, directly or indirectly
(including through its representatives), solicit for employment or hire any
Person who is listed on _Schedule 6.7_ ; _provided_ that such restriction on
solicitation shall not apply to any general solicitations for employment,
such as any newspaper or Internet help wanted advertisement, or any search
firm engagement, in each case which is not directed at or focused on any
personnel employed by the Company or any of its subsidiaries.

6.8 _Intercompany Accounts_. All intercompany accounts between any Seller or
its Affiliates (other than the Company and its Subsidiaries), on the one
hand, and the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, on the other hand, shall be
settled in full prior to the Closing. At the Closing, the Company shall
provide evidence reasonably satisfactory to Acquiror that all
such intercompany accounts have been settled, if any.

Closing, each Seller (solely with respect to such Seller) or the Company (as
applicable) shall after becoming aware of any of the following promptly notify
Acquiror of:

 

(a) any notice or other communication from any Person alleging that the
consent of such Person is required in connection with the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement;

(b) any written notice or other communication from any Governmental Authority
in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement;

(c) any actions, suits, claims, investigations or proceedings commenced or, to
its knowledge threatened against such Seller or the Company or any of its

(d) any inaccuracy of any representation or warranty, or any failure of any
Seller or of the Company to comply with or satisfy any covenant, condition or
agreement to be complied with or satisfied by it, contained in this Agreement
at any time during the term hereof, in each case, that would reasonably be
expected to cause the conditions set forth in _Section 9.2(a)_ or  _Section
9.2(b)_ not to be satisfied; _provided, however_ , that the delivery of any
notice pursuant to this _Section 6.9_ shall not limit or otherwise affect the
remedies available hereunder to the party receiving that notice.

6.10 _Exercise of Options prior to Closing_. If any Holder of an Option elects
to exercise his or her Options prior to Closing, the Company shall require as
a condition to such exercise and the issuance of Common Stock in respect
thereof that such Holder sign a joinder to this Agreement as a Seller
acknowledging and agreeing to be bound by the terms, conditions and
obligations applicable to the Sellers hereunder. In the event of any such
exercises prior to the Closing, the Company shall provide Acquirer with an
appropriately updated version of _Schedule 3.6(a)_ two Business Days prior to
Closing.

COVENANTS OF ACQUIROR

7.1 _HSR Act and Regulatory Approvals_.

(a) In connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement,
Acquiror shall (and, to the extent required, shall cause its Affiliates to)
comply promptly but in no event later than ten (10) Business Days after the
date hereof with the notification and reporting requirements of the HSR Act.
Acquiror shall use commercially reasonable efforts to comply with any
Information or Document Requests.

(b) Acquiror shall request early termination of any waiting period under the
HSR Act and exercise its best efforts to (i) obtain termination or expiration

Governmental Order to be lifted.

 

(c) Acquiror shall cooperate in good faith with the Regulatory Consent
Authorities and undertake promptly any and all action required to complete
lawfully the transactions contemplated by this Agreement as soon as
practicable (but in any event prior to the Termination Date) and any and all
action necessary or advisable to avoid, prevent, eliminate or remove the
actual or threatened commencement of any proceeding in any forum by or on
behalf of any Regulatory Consent Authority or the issuance of any Governmental
Order that would delay, enjoin, prevent, restrain or otherwise prohibit the
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby, including (i)
proffering and consenting and/or agreeing to a Governmental Order or other
agreement providing for (A) the sale, licensing or other disposition, or the
holding separate, of particular assets, categories of assets or lines of
business of the Company or Acquiror or (B) the termination, amendment or
assignment of existing relationships and contractual rights and obligations of
the Company or Acquiror and (ii) promptly effecting the disposition,
licensing or holding separate of assets or lines of business or the
termination, amendment or assignment of existing relationships and contractual
rights, in each case, at such time as may be necessary to permit the lawful

Termination Date. The entry by any Governmental Authority in any Action of a
Governmental Order permitting the consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby but requiring any of the assets or lines of business of
Acquiror to be sold, licensed or otherwise disposed or held separate
thereafter (including the business and assets of the Company and its
Subsidiaries) shall not be deemed a failure to satisfy any condition
specified in _Article IX_.

(d) Acquiror shall promptly furnish to the Company and the Holder
Representative copies of any notices or written communications received by
Acquiror or any of its Affiliates from any third party or any Governmental
Authority with respect to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and
Acquiror shall permit counsel to the Company an opportunity to review in
advance, and Acquiror shall consider in good faith the views of such counsel
in connection with, any proposed written communications by Acquiror and/or its

40  under the HSR Act or enter into any agreement with any Governmental
Authority without the written consent of the Company. Acquiror agrees to
provide the Company, the Holder Representative and its counsel the
opportunity, on reasonable advance notice, to participate in any substantive
meetings or discussions, either in person or by telephone, between Acquiror
and/or any of its Affiliates, agents or advisors, on the one hand, and
any Governmental Authority, on the other hand, concerning or in connection
with the transactions contemplated hereby. For the avoidance of doubt,
Acquiror shall, on behalf of the parties, control and lead all joint filings,
communications, defense, litigation, negotiations and strategy relating to
the HSR Act or any similar Law relating to the transactions contemplated
hereby.

(e) Each of Acquiror and the Holder Representative shall be responsible for
and pay one half of the filing fees payable to the Regulatory Consent

7.2 _Indemnification and Insurance_.

(a) For six years after the Closing Date, Acquiror agrees that it shall
indemnify and hold harmless each present and former director and officer of
the Company and any of its Subsidiaries against any costs or expenses
(including reasonable attorneys fees), judgments, fines, losses, claims,
damages or liabilities incurred in connection with any Action, whether civil,
criminal, administrative or investigative, arising out of or pertaining to
matters existing or occurring at or prior to the Closing Date, whether
asserted or claimed prior to, at or after the Closing Date, to the fullest
extent that the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, as the case may be, would
have been permitted under applicable Law and its respective certificates of
incorporation, bylaws or other organizational documents in effect on the date
of this Agreement to indemnify such Person (including the advancing of
expenses as incurred to the fullest extent permitted under applicable Law).
Without limiting the foregoing, (i) Acquiror shall cause the Company and each
of its Subsidiaries to maintain for a period of not less than six years from
the Closing Date provisions in its certificate of incorporation, bylaws and
other organizational documents concerning the elimination of liability of
directors and the indemnification (including provisions relating to expense
advancement) of the Companys and its Subsidiaries officers, directors,
employees, and agents that are no less favorable to those Persons than the
provisions of the certificates of incorporation, bylaws and other
organizational documents of the Company or such Subsidiary, as applicable, in
each case, as of the date of this Agreement and (ii) Acquiror agrees that any
indemnification and advancement of expenses available to any current or former
director of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries by virtue of such current
or former directors service as a partner or employee of any investment fund
that is an Affiliate of the Company prior to the Closing (any such current or
former director, a " _Sponsor Director_ ") shall be secondary to the
indemnification and advancement of expenses to be provided by Acquiror, the
Company and its Subsidiaries pursuant to this _Section 7.2_ and that
Acquiror, the Company and its Subsidiaries (A) shall be the primary
indemnitors of first resort for Sponsor Directors pursuant to this  _Section
7.2_, (B) shall be fully responsible for the advancement of all expenses and
the payment of all Damages with respect to Sponsor Directors which are
addressed by this _Section 7.2_ and (C) shall not make any claim for
contribution, subrogation or any other recovery of any kind in respect of any
other indemnification available to any Sponsor Director with respect to any
matter addressed by this _Section 7.2_. Acquiror shall assume, and
be jointly and severally liable for, and shall cause the Company and its
Subsidiaries to honor, each of the covenants in this _Section 7.2_.

 



41  Notwithstanding the foregoing, the rights to indemnification and advancement
of expenses provided for in this Section shall not apply to, and each Holder
waives such rights with respect to, matters or claims arising from claims
made by the Acquiror Indemnified Parties pursuant to _Article XII_.

(b) For a period of six (6) years from the Closing Date, Acquiror shall
maintain in effect directors and officers liability insurance covering those
Persons who are currently covered by the Companys or any of its Subsidiaries
directors and officers liability insurance policies (true, correct and
complete copies of which have been heretofore made available to Acquiror or
its agents or representatives) on terms not materially less favorable than the
terms of such current insurance coverage; _provided_ , _however_ , that (i)
Acquiror may cause coverage to be extended under the current directors and
officers liability insurance by obtaining a six-year "tail" policy containing
terms not materially less favorable than the terms of such current insurance
coverage with respect to claims existing or occurring at or prior to the
Closing Date and (ii) if any claim is asserted or made within such six-year
period, any insurance required to be maintained under this _Section 7.2_
shall be continued in respect of such claim until the final disposition
thereof.

 

(c) Notwithstanding anything contained in this Agreement to the contrary, this
_Section 7.2_ shall survive the consummation of the transaction contemplated
hereby indefinitely and shall be binding, jointly and severally, on all
successors and assigns of Acquiror. In the event that Acquiror or any of its
respective successors or assigns consolidates with or merges into any
other Person and shall not be the continuing or surviving corporation or
entity of such consolidation or merger or transfers or conveys all or
substantially all of its properties and assets to any Person, then, and in
each such case, provision shall be made so that the successors and assigns of
Acquiror, as the case may be, shall succeed to the obligations set forth in
this _Section 7.2_.

_Article VI_ or _Article VII_ , including the obligations of Acquiror with

of third parties that any of Acquiror, the Company, or their respective

of _Article IX_ or otherwise to comply with this Agreement and to consummate
the transaction contemplated hereby as soon as practicable. Notwithstanding
the foregoing, in no event shall the Company or any of its Subsidiaries be
obligated to bear any material expense or pay any material fee or grant any
material concession in connection with 

 



42  obtaining any consents, authorizations or approvals pursuant to the terms of
any Contract to which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is a party in
connection with the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby.

(b) To the extent permitted by Law, each of Acquiror and the Company shall,
promptly furnish to the other copies of any notices or written communications
received by it or any of its Affiliates from any third party or any
Governmental Authority with respect to the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, and to the extent permitted by Law, shall permit the other partys
counsel an opportunity to review in advance any proposed written
communications to any Governmental Authority concerning the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement and/or to consult in advance of any meeting or
conference with any Governmental Authority, including in connection with any
proceeding by a private party, and each of Acquiror and the Company shall
consider in good faith the views of the other partys counsel in connection
with such written communication, meeting or conference. The foregoing
obligations shall be subject to the Confidentiality Agreement.

and deliver to one another the Escrow Agreement at the Closing.

8.3 _Tax Matters_.

 

(a) The Company shall prepare and file, or cause to be prepared and filed, any
and all Tax Returns required to be filed by the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries on or prior to the Closing Date (after giving effect to any valid
extensions of the due date for filing any such Tax Returns). Each such Tax
Return shall be prepared in a manner consistent with the prior Tax Returns of
the Company, unless otherwise required by applicable Law.

(b) Acquiror shall prepare and file, or cause to be prepared and filed, any
and all Tax Returns required to be filed by the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries with respect to (i) any taxable period ending on or before the
Closing Date and (ii) any Straddle Tax Period, in each case, which Tax Returns
are required by Law to be filed by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
after the Closing Date (taking into account any applicable extensions of the
due date for filing any such Tax Returns). With respect to the foregoing
sentence, (i) each such Tax Return shall be prepared and timely filed in a
manner consistent with the past practices of the Company and its Subsidiaries,
unless otherwise required by applicable Law, (ii) any income tax or other
material Tax Return will be delivered to the Holder Representative, for the
Holder Representatives review, a reasonable period of time before the filing
date (and no later than 30 Business Days before the filing date if the Tax
Return is an Income Tax Return), and (iii) any revision reasonably requested
in writing by the Holder Representative no later than fifteen (15) days before
the due date (taking into account any applicable extensions of the due date)
for filing will be incorporated in the Tax Return; provided, that in the case
of a Tax Return with respect to a Straddle Tax Period, such revisions shall be
limited to such portions of such Tax Return that relate to the Pre-Closing Tax
Period and affect the amount of Taxes shown as due on such Tax Return that
is allocable to the Pre-Closing Tax Period pursuant to _Section 8.3(g)_.

(c) Each party hereto agrees to, and agrees to cause its Affiliates and
employees to, cooperate fully, as reasonably requested by the other parties,
in connection with the preparation

 



43  of any Tax Return of the Company or its Subsidiaries with respect to any
taxable period ending on or before the Closing Date or any Straddle Tax Period
and the conduct of any Tax Contest Claim. Such cooperation shall include the
retention of and (upon the other partys request) the provision of records and
information reasonably relevant to Tax matters and making employees available
on a mutually convenient basis to provide additional information.

(d) Acquiror shall promptly notify the Holder Representative in writing upon
receipt by any Acquiror Indemnified Party or any of their Affiliates of any
written notice from a taxing authority of an Action with respect to Taxes of
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries which may give rise to an
Indemnification Claim relating to Taxes for which the Acquiror
Indemnified Parties may be entitled to indemnification under _Section
12.2(a)_ (" _Tax Contest Claim_ "). Such notice shall include a copy of the
relevant portion of any correspondence received from the relevant Governmental
Authority and describe in reasonable detail the nature of such Tax Contest
Claim. Acquiror and the Holder Representative shall cooperate with each other
in the conduct of any Tax Contest Claim (and provide such powers of attorney
as may be necessary). Notwithstanding _Section 12.3(b)_, the Holder
Representative shall have the right to control the conduct of any Tax Contest
Claim relating to any Tax period that ends on or prior to the Closing Date so
long as there are remaining Indemnification Escrow Funds (any such claim, a "
_Holder Representative s Tax Contest Claim_"); _provided_ , that if the
resolution or settlement of such Holder Representatives Tax Contest Claim
would have an adverse effect on the Acquiror Indemnified Parties in a Post-
Closing Tax Period, the Holder Representative shall keep Acquiror informed
regarding the progress and substantive aspects of such Holder Representatives
Tax Contest Claim, Acquiror shall be entitled at its expense to participate
in such Holder Representatives Tax Contest Claim, and the Holder
Representative shall not compromise or settle any such Holder Representatives
Tax Contest Claim without obtaining Acquirors prior written consent (which
consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed).
Notwithstanding _Section 12.3(b)_, Acquiror shall have the right to control
the conduct of any Holder Representatives Tax Contest Claim that the Holder
Representative does not elect to control and any Tax Contest Claim that is not
a Holder Representatives Tax Contest Claim; provided, that Acquiror shall
keep the Holder Representative informed regarding the progress
and substantive aspects of such Tax Contest Claim, the Holder Representative
shall be entitled to participate in such Tax Contest Claim at its own expense,
and Acquiror shall not compromise or settle any such Tax Contest Claim without
obtaining the Holder Representatives prior written consent (which consent
shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed).

(e) The parties hereto agree that all Transaction Tax Deductions arising by
reason of payments made on or after the Closing Date will be treated as items
allocable to the Post-Closing Tax Period to the extent permitted by Law.

 

(f) After the Closing, except as required by Law or with the prior written
consent of the Holder Representative (which consent will not be unreasonably
withheld or delayed), Acquiror agrees not to, and agrees to cause its
Affiliates not to, (i) file any amended Tax Return, (ii) make or change any
Tax election, (iii) adopt or change any Tax accounting method, (iv) change
any annual Tax accounting period, (v) agree to extend any statute of
limitations for Taxes, (vi) settle any right to a Pre-Closing Tax Refund,
(vii) initiate any voluntary disclosure with respect to Taxes, or (viii) take
any other similar action relating to Taxes or Tax Returns, in each case, if
such action would increase the amount of entitlement of any Acquiror
Indemnified

 



44  Party to indemnification pursuant to this Agreement or would decrease the
amount of entitlement of any Holder with respect to a Pre-Closing Tax Refund.
Acquiror agrees not to, and agrees to cause its Affiliates not to, (i) make
any election under Section 338 of the Code (or any similar provision of state,
local, or foreign Tax Law) with respect to the transactions contemplated
hereby, or (ii) take any action or enter into any transaction on the Closing
Date after the Closing other than in the ordinary course of business or as
explicitly contemplated hereby.

(g) To the extent permitted under applicable Law and to the extent necessary
to cause such effect, each party hereto agrees to, and agrees to cause its
Affiliates to, elect for all Tax purposes to end on the Closing Date (at the
end of the Closing Date) all taxable periods of the Company and its
Subsidiaries beginning on or before the Closing Date. The amount of any Income
Tax or any other Tax that is not a property Tax or similar ad valorem Tax for
the Pre-Closing Tax Period of any Straddle Tax Period will be determined
based on an interim closing of the books as of the close of business on the
Closing Date (and for the foregoing purpose, (i) the taxable period of any
partnership or other pass-through entity in which the Company or any its
Subsidiaries holds a beneficial interest will be deemed to terminate at such
time and (ii) no election for ratable allocation will be made under Treasury
Regulations Section 1.1502-76(b)(2)(ii) (or any similar provision of
state, local, or foreign Tax Law)). The amount of any property Tax or similar
ad valorem Tax of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries for the Pre-Closing
Tax Period of any Straddle Tax Period will be deemed to be the amount of the
Tax for the Straddle Tax Period multiplied by a fraction the numerator of
which is the number of days in the Pre-Closing Tax Period and the denominator
of which is the number of days in the Straddle Tax Period. The amount of any
Pre-Closing Tax Refund of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries for the Pre-
Closing Tax Period of any Straddle Tax Period will be determined using the
method provided in this _Section 8.3(g)_.

 

(h) Acquiror agrees to pay to the Holder Representative (on behalf of the
Holders) the amount of any Tax refund (together with any interest paid or
credited with respect thereto) of the Company for any Pre-Closing Tax Period
(i) promptly upon the receipt of such Tax refund or (ii) when used by the
Company to credit an account with a Taxing Authority or to offset any Taxes
of the Company for any Post-Closing Tax Period (each of (i) and (ii), a "
_Pre-Closing Tax Refund_ "). Acquiror agrees to, and agrees to cause its
Affiliates to use reasonable efforts to obtain any such Pre-Closing Tax
Refund. Acquiror agrees to permit the Holder Representative to participate
(at its expense) in the efforts to obtain any Pre-Closing Tax Refund.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, any such Pre-Closing Tax Refund shall be for
the account of the Acquiror to the extent that such Pre-Closing Tax Refund is
attributable to the carryback from a Post-Closing Tax Period (or the portion
of a Straddle Period that begins on the day after the Closing Date) of items
of loss, deductions or other Tax items of the Acquirer (or any of its
Affiliates).

(i) All Transfer Taxes, if any, arising out of or in connection with the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement shall be equally apportioned
between the Sellers, on the one hand, and Acquiror, on the other hand. Each of
the Sellers, on the one hand, and Acquiror, on the other hand shall (i)
prepare and file, or cause to be prepared and filed, any and all necessary
Tax Returns and other documentation with respect to all such Transfer Taxes as
required by applicable Law to be filed by such party, (ii) pay or cause to be
paid, Transfer Taxes when due and (iii) be entitled to make a claim under
_Section 12.2(a)_ or _Section 12.2(b)_ as applicable. If

 



45  required by applicable Law, the parties will join in the execution of any
such Tax Returns and other documentation at the request of another party. All
parties hereto shall use commercially reasonable efforts to avail themselves
of any available exemptions from any such Transfer Taxes, and to cooperate
with the other parties hereto in providing any information and documentation
that may be necessary to obtain such exemptions.

 

(j) Except as otherwise required by Law, the parties hereto agree to treat for
all Tax purposes all payments under this  _Section 8.3_ and all
indemnification payments under _Article XII_ as adjustments to the Purchase
Price.

ARTICLE XI.

 

HOLDER REPRESENTATIVE

11.1 _Designation and Replacement of Holder Representative_. The parties have
agreed that it is desirable to designate a representative to act on behalf of
holders of the Common Stock and the Options for certain limited purposes, as
specified herein (the " _Holder Representative_ "). The parties have
designated Odyssey Investment Partners, LLC (" _Odyssey_ "), as the initial
Holder Representative. Odyssey hereby accepts such appointment. The Holder
Representative may resign at any time, and the Holder Representative may be
removed by the vote of Persons which collectively owned more than fifty
percent (50%) of the Aggregate Fully-Diluted Common Shares immediately prior
to the Closing (the " _Majority Holders_ "). In the event that a Holder
Representative has resigned or been removed, a new Holder Representative shall
be appointed by a vote of the Majority Holders, such appointment to become
effective upon the written acceptance thereof by the new Holder
Representative.

11.2 _Authority and Rights of the Holder Representative; Limitations on
Liability_. (a) The Sellers agree that the Holder Representative shall have
such powers and authority as are necessary to carry out the functions assigned
to it under this Agreement; _provided_ , _however_ , that the Holder
Representative shall have no obligation to act on behalf of the Holders,
except as expressly provided herein. Without limiting the generality of the
foregoing, the Holder Representative shall have full power, authority and
discretion to (i) expend Holder Allocable Expenses, (ii) enter into
the Escrow Agreement on behalf of the Holders and (iii) after the Closing,
negotiate and enter into amendments to this Agreement and the Escrow Agreement
for and on behalf of the Holders. The Holder Representative shall have no
liability to Acquiror, the Company or any Holder with respect to actions
taken or omitted to be taken in its capacity as the Holder Representative. The
Holder Representative shall at all times be entitled to rely on any directions
received from the Majority Holders; _provided_ , _however_ , that the Holder
Representative shall not be required to follow any such direction, and shall
be under no obligation to take any action in its capacity as the Holder
Representative, unless the Holder Representative is holding funds delivered
to it under _Section 2.5_ of this Agreement and/or has been provided with
other funds, security or indemnities which, in the sole determination of the
Holder Representative, are sufficient to protect the Holder Representative
against the costs, expenses and liabilities which may be incurred by the
Holder Representative in responding to such direction or taking such action.
The Holder Representative shall be entitled to engage such counsel, experts
and other agents and consultants as it shall deem necessary in connection with
exercising its powers and performing its function hereunder and (in the
absence of bad faith on the part of the Holder Representative) shall be
entitled to conclusively rely on the opinions and advice of such Persons. All
actions, decisions and instructions of the Holder Representative shall be
conclusive and binding upon each of the holders of Common Stock and/or
Options. The

 



49  Holder Representative shall be entitled to reimbursement from funds paid to
it under _Section 2.5_ of this Agreement, released from the Escrow Funds for
the benefit of Holders and/or otherwise received by it in its capacity as the
Holder Representative pursuant to or in connection with this Agreement, for
all reasonable expenses, disbursements and advances (including fees and
disbursements of its counsel, experts and other agents and consultants)
incurred by the Holder Representative in such capacity, and shall be entitled
to indemnification against any loss, liability or expenses arising out of
actions taken or omitted to be taken in its capacity as the
Holder Representative (except for those arising out of the Holder
Representatives bad faith or willful misconduct), including the costs and
expenses of investigation and defense of claims. In the event that the Holder
Allocable Expenses exceed the amount actually incurred by the Holder
Representative in its capacity as such upon the final release of the Escrow
Funds, such excess amount shall be distributed to the Escrow Agent and the
Escrow Agent shall pay to each Holder an amount in cash equal to (i) the
balance of such excess, _multiplied_ _by_ (ii) such Holders Escrow
Percentage, less any applicable withholding.

 

(b) Acquiror shall be entitled to rely conclusively on the instructions and
decisions given or made by the Holder Representative as to any of the matters
that fall within the Holder Representatives powers and to deal exclusively
with the Holder Representative on all matters relating to this Agreement, and
no party shall have any cause of action against Acquiror for any action
taken by Acquiror in reliance upon any such instructions or decisions.

11.3 _Legal Process_. For any action arising under this Agreement or related
to the transactions contemplated herein, a holder of Common Stock or Options
may be served legal process by registered mail to the address set forth herein
for the Holder Representative (or any alternative address designated to the
parties in writing), and that service in such manner shall be adequate and
such holder of Common Stock or Options shall not assert any defense of claim
that service in such manner was not adequate or sufficient in any court in any
jurisdiction.

 

ARTICLE XII.

 

INDEMNIFICATION

warranties in _Section 3.13(d)_ and ( _i)_ (Company Benefit Plans), _Section
3.20_ (Environmental Matters) and _Section 3.16_ (Taxes), and the
Fundamental Representations (other than the Seller Representations that are

shall survive the Closing and continue in full force and effect for 36 months
from the Closing Date, (y) all of the Seller Representations and the
representations and warranties contained in  _Section 3.1_ (Due
Incorporation) and _Section 3.6_ (Capitalization) shall survive the Closing
and continue in full force and effect indefinitely or until the latest date

contained in this Agreement or in any certificate or other writing delivered
pursuant hereto or in connection herewith that, by its terms, provides for
performance following the Closing Date shall survive the Closing indefinitely
or for the shorter period explicitly specified therein, except that for such
covenants and agreements that survive for such shorter period, breaches
thereof shall

 



50  survive indefinitely or until the latest date permitted by law (each such
date, a " _Survival Expiration Date_ "); _provided_ , _further_ , that each
representation, warranty, covenant or agreement shall survive the applicable
Survival Expiration Date for purposes of any Indemnification Claim properly
given in respect thereof prior to such date. No Indemnification Claim with
respect to a breach of a representation or warranty may be asserted pursuant
to this Agreement unless (i) on or before the applicable Survival Expiration
Date, such claim is asserted by proper written notice in accordance with this
_Article XII_ , specifying in reasonable detail the basis of the claim, and
(ii) such claim is made in respect of Damages specified in reasonable detail
and incurred prior to the applicable Survival Expiration Date or, to the
extent arising out of an Indemnification Claim asserted in writing prior to
the applicable Survival Expiration Date, such Indemnification Claim is made in
respect of Damages expected in good faith to arise in connection with such
claim.

 

12.2 _Indemnification_.

(a) Subject to  _Section 12.5_, from and after the Closing, Acquiror and its
Subsidiaries and their respective successors and assignees (collectively, the
" _Acquiror Indemnified Parties_ ") shall be entitled to indemnification from
the Indemnification Escrow Fund for any and all Damages to the extent arising
from (i) any breach of any representation or warranty the Company has made in
_Article III_ of this Agreement determined, except with respect to  _Section
3.7_ and _Section 3.21(a)_, without regard to any qualification or exception
contained therein relating to Material Adverse Effect, materiality or any
similar qualification or standard including specified dollar thresholds
(other than any specified dollar threshold set forth in _Section 3.11(a)(i)_
through _(xiv)_ ), (ii) any breach of any covenant or agreement contained in
this Agreement requiring performance by the Company prior to or at the
Closing or by the Holder Representative, in its capacity as such, after the
Closing, (iii) any Covered Tax (but only if and to the extent such Tax was not
included as a liability in the determination of Closing Date Net Working
Capital), (iv) any breach of any Seller Representation or any covenant or
agreement of any Seller contained in this Agreement or (v) any Closing Date
Funded Debt or Outstanding Company Expenses in each case not taken into
account in the determination of the Purchase Price pursuant to _Section
2.2_, as adjusted pursuant to _Section 2.4_. Subject to _Section 12.5_, from
and after the Closing, each Seller shall severally, but not jointly, indemnify
and hold harmless the Acquiror Indemnified Parties for any and all Damages to
the extent arising from (x) any breach of any Seller Representation or any
covenant or agreement of such Seller contained in this Agreement, (y) any
breach of any representation or warranty contained in _Section 3.1_ or
_Section 3.6_ or (z) any Closing Date Funded Debt or Outstanding Company
Expenses in each case not taken into account in the determination of the
Purchase Price pursuant to _Section 2.2_, as adjusted pursuant to _Section
2.4_. Subject to _Section 12.5_, from and after the Closing, the Acquiror
Indemnified Parties shall be entitled to indemnification for a breach of any
Seller Representation solely from the Seller responsible for such breach. No
Seller shall be liable pursuant to this _Section 12.2_ to Acquiror for any
Damages relating to the breach by another Seller of a Seller Representation.

 

(b) Subject to _Section 12.5_, from and after the Closing, Acquiror shall
indemnify, defend and hold the Holders harmless for any and all Damages to
the extent arising from (i) any breach of any representation or warranty
Acquiror has made in this Agreement, (ii) any breach of any covenant or
agreement contained in this Agreement requiring performance by Acquiror prior

 



51  to or at the Closing or by Acquiror or (iii) any Transfer Taxes apportioned
to Acquiror under _Section 8.3(i)_.

 

12.3 _Third Party Claim Procedures_.

(a) Upon receipt of any notice of an Action by a third party that may give
rise to an Indemnification Claim by a Person entitled to indemnification under
this Agreement (each, an " _Indemnified Party_ "), such Indemnified Party
shall promptly deliver to the Indemnitor a written notice (A) describing in
reasonable detail the nature of the Action, (B) including a copy of all papers
served with respect to such Action, (C) including the Indemnified Partys
best estimate of the amount of Damages that may arise from such Action, and
(D) describing in reasonable detail the basis for the Indemnified Partys
request for indemnification under this Agreement (taking into account the
information then available to the Indemnified Party). Failure to notify the
Indemnitor in accordance with this _Section 12.3(a)_ will not relieve the
Indemnitor of any liability that it may have to the Indemnified Party, except
to the extent (1) the defense of such Action is materially prejudiced by the
Indemnified Partys failure to give such notice or (2) the Indemnified Party
fails to notify the Indemnitor of such Indemnification Claim in accordance
with this  _Section 12.3(a)_ prior to applicable the Survival Expiration
Date.

(b) An Indemnitor may elect to assume and thereafter conduct the defense of
any Action subject to any Indemnification Claim relating to a third party
claim (a " _Third Party Claim_ ") (except for any Tax Contest Claim, which,
notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this  _Section 12.3_, shall be
exclusively governed by _Section 8.3(d)_) with counsel of the Indemnitors
choice at the Indemnitors expense; _provided_ that prior to assuming control
of such defense, the Indemnitor must (i) acknowledge that it would have an
indemnity obligation for the Damages resulting from such Third Party Claim as
provided under this Article XII (assuming the accuracy of the basis of the
claim set forth in the applicable notice delivered to the Indemnitor) and
(ii) furnish the Indemnified Party with evidence that the Indemnitor has
adequate resources to defend such Indemnification Claim and fulfill its
indemnity obligations hereunder (if applicable, taking into account the
Escrow Amount for the payment of any Damages that may be incurred by the
Indemnitee, but not for any costs or expenses that may incurred by the
Indemnitor). The Indemnitor shall not be entitled to assume or maintain
control of the defense of any Third Party Claim and shall pay the fees and
expenses of counsel retained by the Indemnified Party with respect to such
Third Party Claim if (i) the Indemnitor does not deliver the acknowledgment
referred to in the preceding sentence within 30 days of receipt of notice of
such Indemnification Claim pursuant to _Section 12.3(a)_, (ii) such Third
Party Claim relates to or arises in connection with any criminal proceeding,
action, indictment, allegation or investigation, (iii) such Third Party Claim
seeks material injunctive or equitable relief against the Indemnified Party or
any of its Affiliates or (iv) the Indemnitee provides notice to the Indemnitor
that it reasonably believes that the Indemnitor has failed or is failing to
prosecute or defend vigorously such Third Party Claim and after 30 days of
receipt of such notice the Indemnitor continues to fail to prosecute or defend
vigorously such Third Party Claim. Notwithstanding anything herein to the
contrary, (x) if the Indemnified Party controls the defense of such Third
Party Claim in accordance with the terms of this _Section 12.3(b)_ the
Indemnified Party will not agree to the entry of any judgment or enter into
any settlement or compromise with respect to such Action without the prior
written consent of the Indemnitor (which consent shall not be unreasonably
withheld or delayed) and (y) if the Indemnitor shall assume and control the
defense of any Third 

 



52  Party Claim in accordance with the terms of this _Section 12.3(b)_, the
Indemnitor will not agree to the entry of any judgment or enter into any
settlement or compromise with respect to such Third Party Claim without the
Indemnified Partys prior written approval (which must not be unreasonably
withheld or delayed), unless the terms of such settlement provide for a
complete release of the claims, liabilities and obligations that are the
subject of such Action in favor of the Indemnified Party and its Affiliates
and does not impose material injunctive or other material equitable relief
against the Indemnified Party or any of its affiliates.

 

(c) In circumstances where the Indemnitor is controlling the defense of a
Third Party Claim in accordance with _Section 12.3(b)_, the Indemnified
Party shall be entitled to participate in the defense of such claim and to
employ separate counsel of its choice for such purpose, in which case the fees
and expenses of such separate counsel shall be borne by the Indemnified
Party;  _provided_ that in such event the Indemnitor shall pay the fees and
expenses of such separate counsel if representation of both the Indemnifying
Party and the Indemnified Party by the same counsel would create a conflict of
interest.

 

(d) Each Party shall reasonably cooperate with the conduct of the defense or
prosecution of a Third Party Claim and at the reasonable request of the other
party shall grant the other party and its representatives reasonable access to
its books, records, employees and properties to the extent reasonably related
to the matters to which the applicable Third Party Claim relates. All
such access shall be granted during normal business hours and shall be
granted under the conditions which shall not unreasonably interfere with the
business and operations of such party.

 

12.4 _Direct Claim Procedures_. In the event an Indemnified Party has a claim
for indemnity under _Section 12.2_ against an Indemnitor that does not
involve a Third Party Claim, the Indemnified Party agrees to give prompt
notice in writing of such claim to the Indemnitor. Such notice shall set forth
in reasonable detail such claim and the basis for indemnification. Failure to
notify the Indemnitor in accordance with this _Section 12.4_ will not
relieve the Indemnitor of any liability that it may have to the Indemnified
Party, except to the extent (1) such failure shall have materially prejudiced
the Indemnitor or (2) the Indemnified Party fails to notify the Indemnitor of
such Indemnification Claim in accordance with this _Section 12.4_ prior to
the applicable Survival Expiration Date.

 

12.5 _Limitations on Indemnification Liability_. Notwithstanding any provision
of this Agreement to the contrary, any claims an Indemnified Party
makes under this _Article XII_ will be limited as follows:

(a) _Indemnification Cap_. Except with respect to indemnification for Damages
that relate to any breach of a Seller Representation or the matters
indemnifiable pursuant to _Section 12.2(a)(y)_ or _(z)_ , the aggregate
amount of Damages for which the Acquiror Indemnified Parties shall be entitled
to indemnification pursuant to this _Article XII_ will not exceed the
Indemnification Escrow Amount. The Indemnification Escrow Amount then
remaining in escrow shall serve as the sole and exclusive source of payment of
any Indemnification Claim pursuant to _Section 12.2(a),_ except with respect
to indemnification for Damages that relate to any breach of a Seller
Representation or the matters indemnifiable pursuant to _Section 12.2(a)(y)_
or _(z)_ ; _provided_ , that, (A) any claim made by any Acquiror Indemnified
Party pursuant to this

 



53   _Article XII_ related to a breach of a Seller Representation or the matters
indemnifiable pursuant to _Section 12.2(a)(y)_ or _(z)_ shall be (i) paid
first from the Indemnification Escrow Amount then remaining in escrow and
(ii) then, subject to the terms and conditions of this _Section 12.5_, paid
directly by the Holders and (B) disregarding any payments of Indemnification
Escrow Funds to the Acquirer Indemnified Parties, the total amount of
indemnification payments that any Holder shall be required to make to the
Acquiror Indemnified Parties in respect of any breaches of Seller
Representations or the matters indemnifiable pursuant to _Section
12.2(a)(y)_ or _(z)_ shall not exceed the aggregate Closing Cash Per Fully-
Diluted Common Share amount actually received by such Holder as of the date of
determination.

 

(b) _Claims Basket_. The Acquiror Indemnified Parties shall not be entitled to
indemnification pursuant to this _Article XII_ with respect to any
Indemnification Claim unless and until the amount of Damages (excluding costs
and expenses of Acquiror Indemnified Parties incurred in connection with
making such claim under this Agreement) incurred by the Acquiror
Indemnified Parties that are the subject of such claim or series of related
claims exceeds $40,000 (the " _Per-Claim Basket_ "). Except with respect to
indemnification for Damages that relate to any breach of a Fundamental
Representation, the Acquiror Indemnified Parties shall only be entitled to
indemnification pursuant to _Section 12.2(a)(i)_ to the extent the aggregate
amount of all Damages (excluding costs and expenses of Acquiror Indemnified
Parties incurred in connection with making such claim under this Agreement)
incurred by the Acquiror Indemnified Parties for which the Acquiror
Indemnified Parties are (or, in the absence of the preceding sentence, would
have been) entitled to indemnification pursuant to  _Section 12.2(a)(i)_
exceeds $2,000,000 (the " _Basket Amount_ "), and the Acquiror Indemnified
Parties shall only be entitled to indemnification for such Damages to the
extent such Damages exceed the Basket Amount.

 

(c) _Damages Net of Insurance Proceeds, Tax Benefits and Other Third-Party
Recoveries_. All Damages for which any Indemnified Party would otherwise be
entitled to indemnification under this _Article XII_ shall be reduced by the
amount of net federal, state or local Tax benefits actually realized by
Acquiror as a result of such Damages with respect to the taxable year of
payment for such Damages or any prior taxable year (" _Realized Tax Benefits_
"), and any insurance proceeds, indemnification payments and other third-party
recoveries which any Indemnified Party actually receives in respect of any
Damages incurred by such Indemnified Party. In the event any Indemnified
Party or any of its Affiliates is entitled to any insurance proceeds, Realized
Tax Benefits, indemnity payments or any third-party recoveries in respect of
any Damages (or any of the circumstances giving rise thereto) for which such
Indemnified Party is entitled to indemnification pursuant to this _Article
XII_ , such Indemnified Party shall use commercially reasonable efforts to
obtain, receive or realize such proceeds, benefits, payments or recoveries.
In the event that any such insurance proceeds, Realized Tax Benefits,
indemnity payments or other third party recoveries are obtained, received or
realized by an Indemnified Party subsequent to receipt by such Indemnified
Party of any indemnification payment hereunder in respect of the claims to
which such insurance proceeds, Realized Tax Benefits, indemnity payments or
other third-party recoveries relate, appropriate refunds shall be made
promptly by the relevant Indemnified Parties of all or the relevant portion
of such indemnification payment. For purposes of this _Section 12.5(c)_, any
Indemnified Party shall be deemed to have "actually realized" a net Tax
benefit to the extent that, and at such time as, the amount of Taxes paid by
such Indemnified Party is reduced below the amount of Taxes that such Persons
would have been required to pay but for the Tax benefit. In computing the
amount of any such net Tax 

 



54  benefit, the Indemnified Party shall be deemed to recognize all other items
of income, gain, loss, deduction or credit before recognizing any items
arising from the incurrence or payment of any Losses for which
indemnification is provided under this _Article XII._

(d) _Assignment of Claims_. If any Indemnified Party receives any
indemnification payment pursuant to this _Article XII_ and the Indemnified
Party could have recovered all or a part of such Damages from a third party (a
" _Potential Contributor_ ") based on the underlying claim asserted against
the Indemnifying Party, if the Indemnitor is controlling such Indemnification
Claim pursuant to _Section 12.3(b)_, at the election of the Indemnitor, such
Indemnified Party shall assign to the Indemnitor all of its claims for
recovery against any Potential Contributor as to such Damages, whether by
insurance coverage, contribution claims, subrogation or otherwise.

 

(e) _Punitive and Certain Other Damages_. No Indemnified Party shall be
entitled to indemnification for any (i) special, punitive or exemplary
damages, except to the extent payable in connection with a Third Party Claim,
(ii) any loss of enterprise value, diminution in value of any business, damage
to reputation, loss relating to business interruption or lost opportunity
or loss of goodwill or (iii) lost profits or other Damages not reasonably
foreseeable from the facts or circumstances giving rise to the claim for
indemnification. In valuing Damages, the parties agree that no adjustment
shall be made as a result of any multiple, increase factor, or any premium
over fair market, book, or historical value that may have been factored into
Acquirors decisions relating to the Enterprise Value, regardless of whether
or not such multiple, increase factor or other premium had been used by
Acquiror at the time of, or in connection with, calculating its Enterprise
Value or any proposal or bid relating thereto.

 

(f) _Damages Reserved for on the Closing Balance Sheet or Included in Purchase
Price_. No Acquiror Indemnified Party shall be entitled to indemnification
for any Damages (i) in respect of any liability or obligation to the extent
accrued or reserved for on the Closing Balance Sheet or (ii) in respect of any
liability specifically included in the calculation of the Purchase Price.

(g) _No Duplicate Claims_. In the event an Acquiror Indemnified Party or
Holder, as the case may be, recovers Damages in respect of an Indemnification
Claim, no other Acquiror Indemnified Party or Holder, as applicable, may
recover the same Damages in respect of a claim for indemnification under this
Agreement.

 

(h) _Limitations on Tax Indemnification_. No Acquiror Indemnified Party shall
be indemnified for Damages relating to (i) any Taxes with respect to any
Post-Closing Tax Period other than Taxes arising from a breach of the
representation contained in _Sections 3.16(e)_, _3.16(f)_ or _3.16(h)_ or
(ii) any Taxes attributable to any breach of any covenant hereunder by
Acquiror or its Affiliates.

12.6 _Mitigation of Damages_. An Indemnified Party shall use its reasonable
best efforts to mitigate any Damages for which it is entitled to
indemnification pursuant to this _Article XII_ upon and after becoming aware
of any event or condition that has given rise to such Damages.

 

12.7 _Indemnification Sole and Exclusive Remedy_. Each of the parties hereto
acknowledges and agrees that from and after the Closing, claims under this 
_Article XII_ shall be the sole and

 



55  exclusive remedy of the Acquiror Indemnified Parties and the Holders with
respect to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the funds in
the Indemnification Escrow Funds shall be the sole source of recovery of the
Acquiror Indemnified Parties, except, in each case and subject to _Section
12.5_, with respect to claims relating to breaches of the Seller
Representations or the matters indemnifiable pursuant to  _Section
12.2(a)(y)_ or _(z)_. In furtherance of the foregoing, Acquiror and each of
the Acquiror Indemnified Parties, on the one hand, and each of the Holders, on
the other hand, hereby waives, from and after the Closing, to the fullest
extent permitted under applicable Law, any and all rights, claims, and causes
of action it may have against any indemnifying party relating to the subject
matter of this Agreement based upon predecessor or successor liability,
contribution, tort, strict liability or any Law or otherwise. All
representations and warranties set forth in this Agreement are contractual in
nature only and subject to the sole and exclusive remedies set forth in this
_Article XII_.

 

The sole and exclusive remedies for any breach of the terms and provisions of
this Agreement (including any representations and warranties set forth
herein) or any claim or cause of action otherwise arising out of or related to
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement shall be those remedies
available at Law or in equity for breach of contract only (as such contractual
remedies have been further limited or excluded pursuant to the express terms
of this Agreement).

For the avoidance of doubt, any adjustments made to the Purchase Price
pursuant to _Section 2.4_ shall not be considered "remedies" for purposes of
this _Section 12.7_ and shall not be limited by the terms of this _Section
12.7_.

 

12.8 _Release of Escrow_. The Escrow Agreement shall specify that the Escrow
Agent shall release to the Holders in accordance with such Holders relative
Escrow Percentages on the first Business Day following the date that is: (A)
15 months from the Closing Date, the remainder of the Escrow Funds then held
by the Escrow Agent, _minus_ the sum of (i) $16,500,000 and (ii) the actual,
or, if not known, estimated in good faith by the Acquiror Indemnified Parties,
aggregate amount of any Indemnification Claims that shall have been properly
asserted by any Acquiror Indemnified Party in accordance with this Agreement
on or prior to 15 months from the Closing Date and remain pending on such date
(any such claim, an " _Initial Pending Claim_ "), solely to the extent such
calculation results in a positive amount; (B) 24 months from the Closing
Date, the remainder of the Escrow Funds then held by the Escrow Agent, _minus_
the sum of (i) $5,500,000 and (ii) the actual, or, if not known, estimated in
good faith by the Acquiror Indemnified Parties, aggregate amount of any
Indemnification Claims that shall have been properly asserted by any Acquiror
Indemnified Party in accordance with this Agreement on or prior to 24 months
from the Closing Date and remain pending on such date, including the Initial
Pending Claims (any such claim, a " _Subsequent Pending Claim_ "), solely to
the extent such calculation results in a positive amount; (C) 36 months from
the Closing Date, the remainder of the Escrow Funds then held by the Escrow
Agent,  _minus_ the actual, or, if not known, estimated in good faith,
aggregate amount of any Indemnification Claims that shall have been properly
asserted by any Acquiror Indemnified Party in accordance with this Agreement
on or prior to 36 months from the Closing Date and remain pending on such
date, including any Initial Pending Claims and Subsequent Pending Claims (the
" _Total Pending Claims_ "), solely to the extent that such calculation
results in a positive number, and, in each case of clauses (A), (B) and (C),
any funds that remain in escrow following the applicable Survival Expiration
Date in respect of any such Initial Pending Claim,

 



56  Subsequent Pending Claim or Total Pending Claim, as applicable, shall be
released to the Holders entitled to receive the Purchase Price in accordance
with such Holders relative Escrow Percentages promptly upon resolution or
(if applicable) satisfaction of such Initial Pending Claim, Subsequent Pending
Claim or Total Pending Claim, as applicable. In each case in which this
_Section 12.8_ provides for the release of Escrow Funds, each of Acquiror
and the Holder Representative shall promptly submit joint written instructions
to the Escrow Agent instructing the Escrow Agent to distribute the Escrow
Funds in accordance with this _Section 12.8_ and the Escrow Agreement.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, no amounts shall be payable to Holders of
Options pursuant to this _Section 12.8_ following the fifth anniversary of
the Closing.

based upon, arising out of, or related to this Agreement or the transactions
contemplated hereby, shall be governed by, and construed in accordance with,

convenience only and shall not be considered a part of or affect the
construction or interpretation of any provision of this Agreement. This

same instrument.

 

13.8 _Schedules and Annexes_. The Schedules and Annexes referenced herein are

sections or schedules to which the relevance of such disclosure would be
reasonably apparent on its face to a reader without independent knowledge of

disclosed pursuant to this Agreement. The disclosure of any information shall

13.9 _Entire Agreement_. This Agreement (together with the Schedules and
Annexes to this Agreement) and that certain Confidentiality Agreement, dated
as of May 15, 2014 by and between Acquiror and the Company (the "

other prior to making such disclosure and will consider in good faith any
comments provided by the other party); _provided_ that after the transactions
contemplated hereby have been publicly announced, Acquiror shall be entitled

unenforceable by any court of competent jurisdiction, the other provisions
of this Agreement shall remain in full force and effect. The parties further
agree that if any provision contained herein is, to any extent, held invalid,
or unenforceable in any respect under the Laws governing this Agreement, they
shall take any actions necessary to render the remaining provisions of this
Agreement valid and enforceable to the fullest extent permitted by Law and, to
the extent necessary, shall negotiate in good faith to amend or otherwise

13.13 _Jurisdiction; WAIVER OF TRIAL BY JURY_. Any Action based upon, arising
out of or related to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated
hereby (whether brought by any party or any of its Affiliates or against any
party or any of its Affiliates) shall be brought in the Delaware Chancery
Court (or, if the Delaware Chancery Court shall be unavailable, any other
court of the State of Delaware or, in the case of claims to which the federal

ANY AND ALL RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY ACTION BASED UPON, ARISING OUT OF OR
RELATED TO THIS AGREEMENT OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY.

 

13.14 _Enforcement_. The parties agree that irreparable damage for which
monetary damages, even if available, would not be an adequate remedy,
would occur in the event that the parties do

 



61  not perform their obligations under the provisions of this Agreement
(including failing to take such actions as are required of them hereunder to
consummate this Agreement) in accordance with its specified terms or
otherwise breach such provisions. The parties acknowledge and agree that the
parties shall be entitled to an injunction, specific performance, or other
equitable relief, to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to

entitled under this Agreement.

13.15 _Non-Recourse_. This Agreement may only be enforced against, and any

Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby may only be brought against,
the entities that are expressly named as parties hereto and then only with
respect to the specific obligations set forth herein with respect to
such party. Except to the extent a named party to this Agreement (and then
only to the extent of the specific obligations undertaken by such named party
in this Agreement), no past, present or future director, officer, employee,
incorporator, member, partner, stockholder, Affiliate, agent, attorney,
advisor or representative or Affiliate of any named party to this Agreement
shall have any liability (whether in contract, tort, equity or otherwise) for
any one or more of the representations, warranties, covenants, agreements or
other obligations or liabilities of any one or more of the Company or Acquiror
under this Agreement of or for any claim based on, arising out of, or related
to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby.

13.16 _Acknowledgement and Waiver_.

 

(a) It is acknowledged by each of the parties hereto that the Holder
Representative and the Company have retained Latham and Watkins LLP (" _L andW_")
to act as their counsel in connection with the transactions contemplated
hereby and that LandW has not acted as counsel for any other Person in
connection with the transactions contemplated hereby for conflict of interest
or any other purposes. Acquiror and the Company agree that any attorney-client
privilege and the expectation of client confidence attaching as a result of
LandWs representation of the Company and the Holder Representative related
to the preparation for, and negotiation and consummation of, the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, including all communications among LandW and the
Company, the Holders, the Holder Representatives and/or their respective
Affiliates related to the preparation for, and negotiation and consummation
of, the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, shall survive the Closing
and shall remain in effect. Furthermore, effective as of the Closing, (i) all
communications (and materials relating thereto) between the Company and its
Subsidiaries and LandW related to the preparation for, and negotiation and
consummation of, the transactions contemplated by this Agreement are hereby
assigned and transferred to the Holder Representative, (ii) the Company and
its Subsidiaries hereby release all of their respective rights and interests
to and in such communications and related materials and (iii) the Company and
its Subsidiaries hereby release any right to assert or waive any privilege
related to the communications referenced in this _Section 13.16_ the Company
and its Subsidiaries acknowledge and agree that all such rights shall reside
with the Holder Representative.

 

(b) Acquiror and the Company agree that, notwithstanding any current or prior
representation of the Company by LandW, LandW shall be allowed to represent any
Holder, the

 



62  Holder Representative or any of their respective Affiliates in any matters
and disputes adverse to Acquiror or the Company that either is existing on the
date hereof or arises in the future and relates to this Agreement and the
transactions contemplated hereby; and Acquiror and the Company hereby waive
any conflicts or claim of privilege that may arise in connection with such
representation. Further, Acquiror and the Company agree that, in the event
that a dispute arises after Closing between Acquiror or the Company and any
Holder, the Holder Representative or any of their respective Affiliates, LandW
may represent such Holder, the Holder Representative or Affiliate in such
dispute even though the interests of such Holder, the Holder Representative
or Affiliate may be directly adverse to Acquiror or the Company and even
though LandW may have represented the Company in a matter substantially related
to such dispute.

 

(c) Acquiror acknowledges that any advice given to or communication with any
Holder, the Holder Representative or any of their respective Affiliates
(other than the Company) shall not be subject to any joint privilege and shall
be owned solely by such Holder, the Holder Representative and any Affiliate of
each such party. Acquiror and the Company each hereby acknowledge that each
of them have had the opportunity to discuss and obtain adequate information
concerning the significance and material risks of, and reasonable available
alternatives to, the waivers, permissions and other provisions of this
Agreement, including the opportunity to consult with counsel other than LandW.
