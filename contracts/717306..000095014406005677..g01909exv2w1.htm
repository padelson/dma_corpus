AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER 

   

 AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER, dated as of June 1, 2006 (this " _Agreement_ "), by and between GBC BANCORP, INC., a Georgia corporation (" _GBC_ "), and FIRST CHARTER CORPORATION, a North Carolina corporation (" _First Charter_ "). 

  

W I T N E S S E T H: 

   

 WHEREAS, the Boards of Directors of GBC and First Charter have determined that it is in the best interests of their respective companies and their shareholders to consummate the strategic business combination transaction provided for in this Agreement in which GBC will, on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement, merge with and into First Charter (the " _Merger_ "), so that First Charter is the surviving corporation in the Merger (sometimes referred to in such capacity as the " _Surviving Corporation_ "); 

  

 WHEREAS, for federal income Tax purposes, it is intended that the Merger shall qualify as a reorganization under the provisions of Section 368(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the " _Code_ "), and this Agreement is intended to be and is adopted as a "plan of reorganization" for purposes of Sections 354 and 361 of the Code; and 

  

 WHEREAS, as an inducement and condition to the entrance of First Charter into this Agreement, each of the Directors and Executive Officers of GBC has agreed to enter into a Voting Agreement in the form set forth in _Exhibit A_ (the " _Voting Agreement_ ") pursuant to which they have agreed to vote in favor of the Merger; 

  

 WHEREAS, the parties desire to make certain representations, warranties and agreements in connection with the Merger and also to prescribe certain conditions to the Merger. 

  

 NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the mutual covenants, representations, warranties and agreements contained in this Agreement, and other good and valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which are hereby acknowledged, and intending to be legally bound hereby, the parties agree as follows: 

  

ARTICLE I 

   

THE MERGER 

   

 1.1 _The Merger_. 

  

 (a) Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, in accordance with the North Carolina Business Corporation Act (the " _NCBCA_ ") and the Georgia Business Corporation Code (the " _GBCC_ "), at the Effective Time GBC shall merge with and into First Charter. First Charter shall be the Surviving Corporation in the Merger and shall continue its corporate existence under the laws of the State of North Carolina. As of the Effective Time, the separate corporate existence of GBC shall cease. 

  

 (b) First Charter may at any time change the method of effecting the combination (including by providing for the merger of GBC and a wholly owned subsidiary of First Charter) 

   ##### 

  

 

if and to the extent requested by First Charter and consented to by GBC (such
consent not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed); _provided_ , _however_ ,
that no such change shall (i) alter or change the amount or kind of the
Merger Consideration provided for in this Agreement, (ii) adversely affect
the Tax treatment of GBCs shareholders as a result of receiving the
Merger Consideration or the Tax treatment of either party pursuant to this
Agreement or (iii) materially impede or delay consummation of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement. 

   

 1.2 _Effective Time_. The Merger shall become effective as set forth in the articles of merger (the " _Articles of Merger_ ") that shall be filed with the Secretary of State of the State of North Carolina and the Secretary of State of the State of Georgia on the Closing Date.

 (a) Holders of GBC Common Stock may elect to receive shares of First Charter Common Stock or cash (in either case without interest) in exchange for their shares of GBC Common Stock in accordance with the following procedures, _provided_ that, in the aggregate and subject to the provisions of _Section 2.4(f)_, 2,975,000 shares of First Charter Common Stock shall be issued as Stock Consideration in the Merger (the " _Total Stock Issuance Number_ ") (unless adjusted pursuant to _Section 8.1(g)_ (such revised number of shares is herein referred to as the 

   ##### 

  

 

" _Revised Total Stock Issuance Number_ ")). Shares of GBC Common Stock as to
which a Cash Election (including, pursuant to a Mixed Election) has been made
are referred to herein as " _Cash Election Shares_." Shares of GBC Common
Stock as to which a Stock Election has been made (including, pursuant to a
Mixed Election) are referred to as " _Stock Election Shares_." Shares of GBC
Common Stock as to which no election has been made (or as to which an Election
Form is not returned properly completed) are referred to herein as " _Non-
Election Shares_." The aggregate number of shares of First Charter Common
Stock that would be issuable giving effect to the aggregate Stock Elections
that are made is referred to herein as the " _Stock Election Number_." 

   

 (b) An election form and other appropriate and customary transmittal materials (which shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the Certificates shall pass, only upon proper delivery of such Certificates to the Exchange Agent), in such form as GBC and First Charter shall mutually agree (" _Election Form_ "), shall be mailed no more than 40 business days and no less than 20 business days prior to the anticipated Effective Time or on such earlier date as GBC and First Charter shall mutually agree (the " _Mailing Date_ ") to each holder of record of GBC Common Stock as of five business days prior to the Mailing Date (the " _Election Form Record Date_"). Each Election Form shall permit such holder, subject to the allocation and election procedures set forth in this _Section 2.2_, to (i) elect to receive the Cash Consideration for all of the shares of GBC Common Stock held by such holder (a " _Cash Election_ "), in accordance with _Section 1.4(c)_, (ii) elect to receive the Stock Consideration for all of such shares (a " _Stock Election_ "), in accordance with _Section 1.4(c)_ or as adjusted in accordance with _Section 8.1(g)_ or as otherwise determined by the parties to this Agreement, (iii) elect to receive the Stock Consideration for a part of such holders GBC Common Stock and the Cash Consideration for the remaining part of such holders GBC Common Stock (a " _Mixed Election_ ") or (iv) indicate that such record holder has no preference as to the receipt of cash or First Charter Common Stock for such shares (a " _Non-Election_ "). A holder of record of shares of First Charter Common Stock who holds such shares as nominee, trustee or in another representative capacity (a " _Representative_ ") may submit multiple Election Forms, _provided_ that each such Election Form covers all the shares of GBC Common Stock held by such Representative for a particular beneficial owner. Any shares of GBC Common Stock with respect to which the holder thereof has not, as of the Election Deadline, made an election by submission to the Exchange Agent of an effective, properly completed Election Form shall be deemed Non-Election Shares. 

  

 (c) To be effective, a properly completed Election Form shall be submitted to the Exchange Agent on or before 5:00 p.m., Charlotte, North Carolina time, on the 25th day following the Mailing Date (or such other time and date as First Charter and GBC may mutually agree) (the " _Election Deadline_ "); _provided_ , _however_ , that the Election Deadline may not occur on or after the Closing Date. First Charter shall use all reasonable efforts to make available as promptly as possible an Election Form to any holder of record of GBC Common Stock who requests such Election Form following the initial mailing of the Election Forms and prior to the Election Deadline. GBC shall provide to the Exchange Agent all information reasonably necessary for it to perform as specified herein. An election shall have been properly made only if the Exchange Agent shall have actually received a properly completed Election Form by the Election Deadline. An Election Form shall be deemed properly completed only if accompanied by one or more Certificates (or customary affidavits and indemnification regarding the loss or destruction of such Certificates or the guaranteed delivery of such Certificates) representing all 

   ##### 

  

 

shares of GBC Common Stock covered by such Election Form, together with duly
executed transmittal materials included with the Election Form. If a GBC
shareholder either (i) does not submit a properly completed Election Form in
a timely fashion or (ii) revokes its Election Form prior to the Election
Deadline (without later submitting a properly completed Election Form
prior to the Election Deadline), the shares of GBC Common Stock held by such
shareholder shall be designated as Non-Election Shares. Any Election Form may
be revoked or changed by the person submitting such Election Form to the
Exchange Agent by written notice to the Exchange Agent only if such notice of
revocation or change is actually received by the Exchange Agent at or prior to
the Election Deadline. First Charter shall cause the Certificate or
Certificates relating to any revoked Election Form to be promptly returned
without charge to the person submitting the Election Form to the Exchange
Agent. Subject to the terms of this Agreement and of the Election Form,
the Exchange Agent shall have discretion to determine when any election,
modification or revocation is received and whether any such election,
modification or revocation has been properly made. 

   

 (d) If the Stock Election Number would result in the Stock Consideration exceeding the Total Stock Issuance Number or the Revised Total Stock Issuance Number, as applicable, then all Cash Election Shares and all Non-Election Shares shall be converted into the right to receive the Cash Consideration, and each holder of Stock Election Shares will be entitled to receive the Stock Consideration only with respect to that number of Stock Election Shares held by such holder (rounded to the nearest whole share) utilizing a percentage such that when all Stock Election Shares are converted the aggregate Stock Consideration issued in the Merger shall equal the Total Stock Issuance Number or the Revised Total Stock Issuance Number, as applicable, with the remaining number of such holders Stock Election Shares being converted into the right to receive the Cash Consideration. 

  

 (e) If the Stock Election Number would result in the Stock Consideration being less than the Total Stock Issuance Number or the Revised Total Stock Issuance Number, as applicable (the amount by which the Total Stock Issuance Number or the Revised Total Stock Issuance Number, as applicable, exceeds the Stock Election Number being referred to herein as the " _Shortfall Number_ "), then all Stock Election Shares shall be converted into the right to receive the Stock Consideration and the Non-Election Shares and Cash Election Shares shall be treated in the following manner: (i) if the Shortfall Number is less than or equal to the number of Non-Election Shares, then all Cash Election Shares shall be converted into the right to receive the Cash Consideration and each holder of Non-Election Shares shall receive the Stock Consideration in respect of that number of Non-Election Shares held by such holder (rounded to the nearest whole share) utilizing a percentage such that when all Non-Election Shares are converted the aggregated Stock Consideration issued in the Merger shall equal the Total Stock Issuance Number or the Revised Total Stock Issuance Number, as applicable, with the remaining number of such holders Non-Election Shares being converted into the right to receive the Cash Consideration; or (ii) if the Shortfall Number exceeds the number of Non-Election Shares, then all Non-Election Shares shall be converted into the right to receive the Stock Consideration, and each holder of Cash Election Shares shall receive the Stock Consideration in respect of that number of Cash Election Shares held by such holder (rounded to the nearest whole share) utilizing a percentage such that when all Cash Election Shares are converted the aggregate Stock Consideration issued in the Merger shall equal the Total Stock Issuance Number or the Revised 

   ##### 

  

 

Total Stock Issuance Number, as applicable, with the remaining number of such
holders Cash Election Shares being converted into the right to receive the
Cash Consideration. 

   

 2.3 _Deposit of Merger Consideration_. At or prior to the Effective Time, First Charter shall deposit, or shall cause to be deposited, with the Exchange Agent (a) certificates representing the number of shares of First Charter Common Stock sufficient to deliver, and First Charter shall instruct the Exchange Agent to timely deliver, the aggregate Stock Consideration, and (b) immediately available funds equal to the aggregate Cash Consideration (together with, to the extent then determinable, any cash payable in lieu of fractional shares pursuant to _Section 2.4(f)_ ) (collectively, the " _Exchange Fund_ ") and First Charter shall instruct the Exchange Agent to timely pay the Cash Consideration, and such cash in lieu of fractional shares, in accordance with this Agreement. 

  

 2.4 _Delivery of Merger Consideration_. 

  

 (a) As soon as reasonably practicable after the Effective Time, the Exchange Agent shall mail to each holder of record of Certificate(s) that immediately prior to the Effective Time represented outstanding shares of GBC Common Stock whose shares were converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration pursuant to _Section 1.4_ and any cash in lieu of fractional shares of First Charter Common Stock to be issued or paid in consideration therefor (i) a letter of transmittal (which shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to Certificate(s) shall pass, only upon delivery of Certificate(s) (or affidavits of loss in lieu of such Certificates) to the Exchange Agent and shall be substantially in such form and have such other provisions as shall be prescribed by the Exchange Agent Agreement (the " _Letter of Transmittal_ ") and (ii) instructions for use in surrendering Certificate(s) in exchange for the Merger Consideration and any cash in lieu of fractional shares of First Charter Common Stock to be issued or paid in consideration therefor in accordance with _Section 2.4(f)_ upon surrender of such Certificate and any dividends or distributions to which such holder is entitled pursuant to  _Section 2.4(c)_. 

  

 (b) Upon surrender to the Exchange Agent of its Certificate or Certificates, accompanied by a properly completed Letter of Transmittal, a holder of GBC Common Stock will be entitled to receive promptly after the Effective Time the Merger Consideration (with the aggregate Cash Consideration paid to each such holder rounded to the nearest whole cent) and any cash in lieu of fractional shares of First Charter Common Stock to be issued or paid in consideration therefor in respect of the shares of GBC Common Stock represented by its Certificate or Certificates. Until so surrendered, each such Certificate shall represent after the Effective Time, for all purposes, only the right to receive the Merger Consideration and any cash in lieu of fractional shares of First Charter Common Stock to be issued or paid in consideration therefor upon surrender of such Certificate in accordance with, and any dividends or distributions to which such holder is entitled pursuant to, this _Article II_. 

  

 (c) No dividends or other distributions with respect to First Charter Common Stock shall be paid to the holder of any unsurrendered Certificate with respect to the shares of First Charter Common Stock represented thereby, in each case until the surrender of such Certificate in accordance with this _Article II_. Subject to the effect of applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar laws, following surrender of any such Certificate in accordance with this  _Article II_, the 

   ##### 

  

 

record holder thereof shall be entitled to receive, without interest, (i) the
amount of dividends or other distributions with a record date after the
Effective Time theretofore payable with respect to the whole shares of First
Charter Common Stock represented by such Certificate and not paid and/or (ii)
at the appropriate payment date, the amount of dividends or
other distributions payable with respect to shares of First Charter Common
Stock represented by such Certificate with a record date after the Effective
Time (but before such surrender date) and with a payment date subsequent to
the issuance of the First Charter Common Stock issuable with respect to such
Certificate. 

   

 (d) In the event of a transfer of ownership of a Certificate representing GBC Common Stock that is not registered in the stock transfer records of GBC, the proper amount of cash and/or shares of First Charter Common Stock shall be paid or issued in exchange therefor to a person other than the person in whose name the Certificate so surrendered is registered if the Certificate formerly representing such GBC Common Stock shall be properly endorsed or otherwise be in proper form for transfer and the person requesting such payment or issuance shall pay any transfer or other similar Taxes required by reason of the payment or issuance to a person other than the registered holder of the Certificate or establish to the satisfaction of First Charter that the Tax has been paid or is not applicable. The Exchange Agent (or, subsequent to the first anniversary of the Effective Time, First Charter) shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the cash portion of the Merger Consideration and any cash in lieu of fractional shares of First Charter Common Stock otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement to any holder of GBC Common Stock such amounts as the Exchange Agent or First Charter, as the case may be, is required to deduct and withhold under the Code, or any provision of state, local or foreign Tax law, with respect to the making of such payment. To the extent the amounts are so withheld by the Exchange Agent or First Charter, as the case may be, such withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the holder of shares of GBC Common Stock in respect of whom such deduction and withholding was made by the Exchange Agent or First Charter, as the case may be. 

  

 (e) After the Effective Time, there shall be no transfers on the stock transfer books of GBC of the shares of GBC Common Stock that were issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time other than to settle transfers of GBC Common Stock that occurred prior to the Effective Time. If, after the Effective Time, Certificates representing such shares are presented for transfer to the Exchange Agent, they shall be cancelled and exchanged for the Merger Consideration and any cash in lieu of fractional shares of First Charter Common Stock to be issued or paid in consideration therefor in accordance with the procedures set forth in this _Article II_. 

  

 (f) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, no certificates or scrip representing fractional shares of First Charter Common Stock shall be issued upon the surrender of Certificates for exchange, no dividend or distribution with respect to First Charter Common Stock shall be payable on or with respect to any fractional share, and such fractional share interests shall not entitle the owner thereof to vote or to any other rights of a shareholder of First Charter. In lieu of the issuance of any such fractional share, First Charter shall pay to each former shareholder of GBC who otherwise would be entitled to receive such fractional share an amount in cash (rounded to the nearest cent) determined by multiplying (i) the closing price of a share of First Charter Common Stock on the Nasdaq National Market on the 

   ##### 

  

 

date of the Effective Time (the " _First Charter Closing Price_ ") by (ii) the
fraction of a share (after taking into account all shares of GBC Common Stock
held by such holder at the Effective Time and rounded to the nearest
thousandth when expressed in decimal form) of First Charter Common Stock to
which such holder would otherwise be entitled to receive pursuant to 
_Section 1.4_. 

   

 (g) Any portion of the Exchange Fund that remains unclaimed by the shareholders of GBC as of the first anniversary of the Effective Time may be paid to First Charter. In such event, any former shareholders of GBC who have not theretofore complied with this _Article II_ shall thereafter look only to First Charter with respect to the Merger Consideration, any cash in lieu of any fractional shares and any unpaid dividends and distributions on the First Charter Common Stock deliverable in respect of each share of GBC Common Stock such shareholder holds as determined pursuant to this Agreement, in each case, without any interest thereon. Notwithstanding the foregoing, none of First Charter, GBC, the Exchange Agent or any other person shall be liable to any former holder of shares of GBC Common Stock for any amount delivered in good faith to a public official pursuant to applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar laws. 

  

 (h) In the event any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if reasonably required by First Charter or the Exchange Agent, the posting by such person of a bond in such amount as First Charter may determine is reasonably necessary as indemnity against any claim that may be made against it with respect to such Certificate, the Exchange Agent will issue in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate the Merger Consideration deliverable in respect thereof pursuant to this Agreement. 

  

 2.5 _Dissenting Shareholders_. Each holder of GBC Common Stock shall be entitled to exercise dissenters rights of appraisal in accordance with and as contemplated by Sections 14-2-1301 et seq. of the GBCC. Any holder of GBC Common Stock who perfects his dissenters rights in accordance with and as contemplated by Sections 14-2-1301 et seq. of the GBCC shall be entitled to receive the value of such GBC Common Stock in cash as determined pursuant to such provisions;  _provided_ , _however_ , that no such payment shall be made to any dissenting shareholder unless and until such dissenting shareholder has complied with Sections 14-2-1301 et seq. of the GBCC and surrendered to First Charter the certificate or certificates representing the shares of GBC Common Stock for which payment is being made. If after the Effective Time a dissenting shareholder of GBC fails to perfect, or effectively withdraws or loses, his right to appraisal and payment for his shares of GBC Common Stock, First Charter shall issue and deliver the consideration to which such holder of GBC Common Stock is entitled under this Agreement (without interest) upon surrender by such holder of the certificate or certificates representing the shares of GBC Common Stock for which payment is being made.

Each of First Charter and GBC shall use its reasonable best efforts to have the Form S-4 declared effective under the Securities Act as promptly as practicable after such filing, and GBC shall thereafter mail or deliver the Proxy Statement to its shareholders. First Charter shall also use its reasonable best efforts to obtain all necessary state securities law or "Blue Sky" permits and approvals required to carry out the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and GBC shall furnish all information concerning GBC and the holders of GBC Common Stock as may be reasonably requested in connection with any such action. 

   ##### 

  

  

 (b) The parties shall cooperate with each other and use their respective reasonable best efforts to promptly prepare and file all necessary documentation, to effect all applications, notices, petitions and filings, to obtain as promptly as practicable all permits, consents, approvals and authorizations of all third parties and Governmental Entities that are necessary or advisable to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (including the Merger), and to comply with the terms and conditions of all such permits, consents, approvals and authorizations of all such third parties or Governmental Entities. GBC and First Charter shall have the right to review in advance, and, to the extent practicable, each will consult the other on, in each case subject to applicable laws relating to the confidentiality of information, all the information relating to GBC or First Charter, as the case may be, and any of their respective Subsidiaries, which appear in any filing made with, or written materials submitted to, any third party or any Governmental Entity in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. In exercising the foregoing right, each of the parties shall act reasonably and as promptly as practicable. The parties shall consult with each other with respect to the obtaining of all permits, consents, approvals and authorizations of all third parties and Governmental Entities necessary or advisable to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and each party will keep the other apprised of the status of matters relating to completion of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing contained herein shall be deemed to require First Charter to take any action, or commit to take any action, or agree to any condition or restriction, in connection with obtaining the foregoing permits, consents, approvals and authorizations of third parties or Governmental Entities, that would reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect (measured on a scale relative to GBC) on either First Charter or GBC (a " _Materially Burdensome Regulatory Condition_ "). 

  

 (c) Each of First Charter and GBC shall, upon request, furnish to the other all information concerning itself, its Subsidiaries, directors, officers and shareholders and such other matters as may be reasonably necessary or advisable in connection with the Proxy Statement, the Form S-4 or any other statement, filing, notice or application made by or on behalf of First Charter, GBC or any of their respective Subsidiaries to any Governmental Entity in connection with the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement. 

  

 (d) Each of First Charter and GBC shall promptly advise the other upon receiving any communication from any Governmental Entity the consent or approval of which is required for consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement that causes such party to believe that there is a reasonable likelihood that any First Charter Requisite Regulatory Approval or GBC Requisite Regulatory Approval, respectively, will not be obtained or that the receipt of any such approval may be materially delayed. 

  

 6.2 _Access to Information; Confidentiality_. 

  

 (a) Upon reasonable notice and subject to applicable laws relating to the confidentiality of information, each of GBC and First Charter shall, and shall cause each of its Subsidiaries to, afford to the officers, employees, accountants, counsel, advisors, agents and other representatives of the other party, reasonable access, during normal business hours during the period prior to the Effective Time, to all its properties, books, contracts, commitments and records, and, during such period, such party shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries to, make available to the other party (i) a copy of each report, schedule, registration statement and other 

   ##### 

  

 

document filed or received by it during such period pursuant to the
requirements of federal securities laws or federal or state banking or
insurance laws (other than reports or documents that such party is not
permitted to disclose under applicable law) and (ii) all other
information concerning its business, properties and personnel as the other
party may reasonably request (in the case of a request by GBC, information
concerning First Charter that is reasonably related to the prospective value
of First Charter Common Stock or to First Charters ability to consummate
the transactions contemplated hereby). Neither GBC nor First Charter, nor any
of their Subsidiaries, shall be required to provide access to or to disclose
information where such access or disclosure would jeopardize the attorney-
client privilege of such party or its Subsidiaries or contravene any law,
rule, regulation, order, judgment, decree, fiduciary duty or binding agreement
entered into prior to the date of this Agreement. The parties shall make
appropriate substitute disclosure arrangements under circumstances in which
the restrictions of the preceding sentence apply. GBC shall provide First
Charter with monthly financial statements as requested by First Charter. 

   

 (b) Each party shall, and shall cause its respective agents and representatives to, maintain in confidence all information received from the other party (other than disclosure to that partys agents and representatives in connection with the evaluation and consummation of the Merger) in connection with this Agreement or the Merger (including the existence and terms of this Agreement) and use such information solely to evaluate the Merger, unless (a) such information is already known to the receiving party or its agents and representatives, (b) such information is subsequently disclosed to the receiving party or its agents and representatives by a third party that, to the knowledge of the receiving party, is not bound by a duty of confidentiality, (c) such information becomes publicly available through no fault of the receiving party, (d) the receiving party in good faith believes that the use of such information is necessary or appropriate in making any filing or obtaining any consent required for the Merger (in which case the receiving party shall advise the other party before making the disclosure) or (e) the receiving party in good faith believes that the furnishing or use of such information is required by or necessary or appropriate in connection with any applicable laws or any listing or trading agreement concerning its publicly traded securities (in which case the receiving party shall advise the other party before making the disclosure). 

  

 All information and materials provided pursuant to this Agreement shall be subject to the provisions of the Confidentiality Agreements entered into between each of the Parties and Burke Capital dated April 3, 2006 and May 23, 2006 (collectively, the " _Confidentiality Agreement_ "). 

  

 (c) No investigation by a party hereto or its representatives shall affect the representations and warranties of the other party set forth in this Agreement.

GBC shall call a meeting of its shareholders (the " _GBC Shareholder Meeting_ ") to be held as soon as reasonably practicable for the purpose of obtaining the requisite shareholder approval required in connection with the Merger, on substantially the terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement, and shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause such meeting to occur as soon as reasonably practicable. The GBC Board shall use its reasonable best efforts to obtain from its shareholders the shareholder vote approving the Merger, on substantially the terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement, required to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. GBC shall submit this Agreement to its 

   ##### 

  

 

shareholders at the shareholder meeting even if the GBC Board shall have
withdrawn, modified or qualified its recommendation. The GBC Board has
adopted resolutions approving the Merger, on substantially the terms and
conditions set forth in this Agreement, and directing that the Merger, on
such terms and conditions, be submitted to GBCs shareholders for their
consideration. 

   

 6.4 _Affiliates_. GBC shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause each director, executive officer and other person who is an "affiliate" (for purposes of Rule 145 under the Securities Act) of GBC to deliver to First Charter, as soon as practicable after the date of this Agreement, and prior to the date of the meeting of the GBC shareholders to be held pursuant to  _Section 6.3_, a written agreement, in the form of _Exhibit B_. 

  

 6.5 _Nasdaq Listing_. First Charter shall cause the shares of First Charter Common Stock to be issued in the Merger to be approved for listing on the Nasdaq National Market, subject to official notice of issuance, prior to the Effective Time. 

  

 6.6 _Employee Matters_. 

  

 (a) After the Closing Date, First Charter shall not maintain any GBC Benefit Plan that is an "employee pension benefit plan" in Section 3(2)(A) of ERISA and which is qualified under Code Section 401(a), and any such plan may be terminated or merged into similar plans maintained by First Charter. For the one-year period following the Effective Time, First Charter shall, or shall cause its applicable Subsidiaries to, provide to those individuals actively employed by GBC or one of its Subsidiaries as of the Effective Time (collectively, the " _Covered Employees_ ") with employee benefits, rates of base salary or hourly wage and annual bonus opportunities that are substantially similar, in the aggregate, to the aggregate rates of base salary or hourly wage provided to such Covered Employees and the aggregate employee benefits and annual bonus opportunities provided to such Covered Employees under the GBC Benefit Plans as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time; _provided_ that nothing herein shall limit the right of First Charter or any of its Subsidiaries to terminate the employment of any Covered Employee at any time or require First Charter or any of its Subsidiaries to provide any such employee benefits, rates of base salary or hourly wage or annual bonus opportunities for any period following any such termination. Except where such benefit is duplicated by substantially similar benefits provided by First Charter to its employees immediately prior to the Closing Date, First Charter or any of its Subsidiaries shall continue to provide any fringe benefits described on _Section 3.11_ of the GBC Disclosure Schedule to the respective Covered Employee for a period of one year after Closing. 

  

 (b) To the extent that a Covered Employee becomes eligible to participate in an employee benefit plan maintained by First Charter or any of its Subsidiaries, other than GBC or its Subsidiaries, First Charter shall cause such employee benefit plan to (i) recognize the service of such Covered Employee with GBC or its Subsidiaries for purposes of eligibility and vesting and, except under defined benefit pension plans, benefit accrual under such employee benefit plan of First Charter or any of its Subsidiaries to the same extent such service was recognized immediately prior to the Effective Time under a comparable GBC Benefit Plan in which such Covered Employee was a participant immediately prior to the Effective Time or, if there is no such comparable benefit plan, to the same extent such service was recognized under the 

   ##### 

  

 

Gwinnett Banking Company 401(k) Employee Stock Ownership Plan immediately
prior to the Effective Time; _provided_ that such recognition of service
shall not operate to duplicate any benefits with respect to the Covered
Employee, and (ii) with respect to any health, dental or vision plan of First
Charter or any of its Subsidiaries (other than GBC and its Subsidiaries)
in which any Covered Employee is eligible to participate in the plan year
that includes the year in which such Covered Employee is eligible to
participate, (x) cause any pre-existing condition limitations under such
First Charter or Subsidiary plan to be waived with respect to such
Covered Employee to the extent such limitation would have been waived or
satisfied under the GBC Benefit Plan in which such Covered Employee
participated immediately prior to the Effective Time, and (y) recognize any
medical or other health expenses incurred by such Covered Employee in the year
that includes the Closing Date for purposes of any applicable deductible and
annual out-of-pocket expense requirements under any such health, dental or
vision plan of First Charter or any of its Subsidiaries. In addition, each
employee of GBC that is retained by First Charter as of the Effective Time
shall receive a one-time $3,000 payment to offset the difference in costs
associated with the transition to First Charters health plan. 

   

 (c) First Charter agrees to honor all unpaid liabilities accrued under all employment agreements, consulting agreements, severance agreements and deferred compensation agreements that GBC or its Subsidiaries have with their current and former employees and directors and which have been disclosed to First Charter on the GBC Disclosure Schedule, including any Executive Supplemental Retirement Agreement, as amended June 1, 2006 and Life Insurance Endorsement Method Split Dollar Plan Agreement, except all as may be amended, superceded or replaced pursuant to the employment or retention agreements referenced in _Section 7.2(e)_. GBC expressly assigns any and all of its rights under such agreements to First Charter. 

  

 6.7 _Indemnification; Directors  and Officers Insurance_. 

  

 (a) In the event of any threatened or actual claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation, whether civil, criminal or administrative (a " _Claim_ "), including any such Claim in which any individual who is now, or has been at any time prior to the date of this Agreement, or who becomes prior to the Effective Time, a director, officer or employee of GBC or any of its Subsidiaries or who is or was serving at the request of GBC or any of its Subsidiaries as a director, officer or employee of another person (the " _Indemnified Parties_ "), is, or is threatened to be, made a party based in whole or in part on, or arising in whole or in part out of, or pertaining to (i) the fact that he is or was a director, officer or employee of GBC or any of its Subsidiaries prior to the Effective Time or (ii) this Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, whether asserted or arising before or after the Effective Time, the parties shall cooperate and use their reasonable best efforts to defend against and respond thereto. All rights to indemnification and exculpation from liabilities for acts or omissions occurring at or prior to the Effective Time now existing in favor of any Indemnified Party as provided in their respective certificates or articles of incorporation or bylaws (or comparable organizational documents), and any existing indemnification agreements set forth on _Section 6.7_ of the GBC Disclosure Schedule, shall survive the Merger and shall continue in full force and effect in accordance with their terms, and shall not be amended, repealed or otherwise modified after the Effective Time in any manner that would adversely affect the rights thereunder of such individuals for acts or omissions occurring at or prior to the Effective Time or taken at the request of First Charter 

   ##### 

  

 

pursuant to _Section 6.8_ hereof, it being understood that nothing in this
sentence shall require any amendment to the articles of incorporation or
bylaws of the Surviving Corporation. 

   

 (b) From and after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, indemnify, defend and hold harmless, and provide advancement of expenses to, each Indemnified Party against all losses, claims, damages, costs, expenses, liabilities or judgments or amounts that are paid in settlement of or in connection with any Claim based in whole or in part on or arising in whole or in part out of the fact that such person is or was a director, officer or employee of GBC or any Subsidiary of GBC, and pertaining to any matter existing or occurring, or any acts or omissions occurring, at or prior to the Effective Time, whether asserted or claimed prior to, or at or after, the Effective Time (including matters, acts or omissions occurring in connection with the approval of this Agreement and the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby) or taken at the request of First Charter pursuant to  _Section 6.8_ hereof. 

  

 (c) First Charter shall cause the individuals serving as officers and directors of GBC or any of its Subsidiaries immediately prior to the Effective Time to be covered for a period of three years from the Effective Time by the directors and officers liability insurance policy maintained by GBC ( _provided_ that First Charter may substitute therefor policies of at least the same coverage and amounts containing terms and conditions that are not less advantageous than such policy) with respect to acts or omissions occurring prior to the Effective Time that were committed by such officers and directors in their capacity as such; _provided_ that in no event shall First Charter be required to expend annually in the aggregate an amount in excess of 125% of the annual premiums currently paid by GBC (which current amount is set forth on _Section 6.7_ of the GBC Disclosure Schedule) for such insurance (the " _Insurance Amount_ "), and  _provided_ _further_ that if First Charter is unable to maintain such policy (or such substitute policy) as a result of the preceding proviso, First Charter shall obtain as much comparable insurance as is available for the Insurance Amount. 

  

 (d) The provisions of this _Section 6.7_ shall survive the Effective Time and are intended to be for the benefit of, and shall be enforceable by, each Indemnified Party and his or her heirs and representatives. 

  

 6.8 _Additional Agreements_. In case at any time after the Effective Time any further action is necessary or desirable to carry out the purposes of this Agreement (including any merger between a Subsidiary of First Charter, on the one hand, and a Subsidiary of GBC, on the other) or to vest the Surviving Corporation with full title to all properties, assets, rights, approvals, immunities and franchises of either party to the Merger, the proper officers and directors of each party and their respective Subsidiaries shall, at First Charters sole expense, take all such necessary action as may be reasonably requested by First Charter. 

  

 6.9 _Advice of Changes_. Each of First Charter and GBC shall promptly advise the other of any change or event (a) having or reasonably likely to have a Material Adverse Effect on it or (b) that it believes would or would be reasonably likely to cause or constitute a material breach of any of its representations, warranties or covenants contained in this Agreement;  _provided_ , _however_ , that no such notification shall affect the representations, warranties, covenants or agreements of the parties (or remedies with respect thereto) or the conditions to the 

   ##### 

  

 

obligations of the parties under this Agreement; _provided_ _further_ that
a failure to comply with this _Section 6.9_ shall not constitute a breach of
this Agreement or the failure of any condition set forth in _Article VII_ to
be satisfied unless the underlying Material Adverse Effect or material breach
would independently result in the failure of a condition set forth in
_Article VII_ to be satisfied. 

   

 6.10 _No Solicitation_. 

  

 (a) None of GBC, its Subsidiaries or any officer, director, employee, agent or representative (including any investment banker, financial advisor, attorney, accountant or other retained representative) of GBC or any of its Subsidiaries shall directly or indirectly (i) solicit, initiate, encourage, facilitate (including by way of furnishing information) or take any other action designed to facilitate any inquiries or proposals regarding any merger, share exchange, consolidation, sale of assets, sale of shares of capital stock (including by way of a tender offer) or similar transactions involving GBC or any of its Subsidiaries that, if consummated, would constitute an Alternative Transaction (any of the foregoing inquiries or proposals being referred to herein as an " _Alternative Proposal_ "), (ii) participate in any discussions or negotiations regarding an Alternative Transaction or (iii) enter into any agreement regarding any Alternative Transaction. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the GBC Board and its investment bankers shall be permitted, prior to the meeting of GBC shareholders to be held pursuant to _Section 6.3_ , and subject to compliance with the other terms of this _Section 6.10_ and to first entering into a confidentiality agreement with the person proposing such Alternative Proposal on terms substantially similar to, and no less favorable to GBC than, those contained in the Confidentiality Agreement, to consider and participate in discussions and negotiations with respect to a bona fide Alternative Proposal received by GBC, if and only to the extent that and so long as the GBC Board reasonably determines in good faith (after consultation with outside legal counsel and financial advisors) that failure to do so would cause it to violate its fiduciary duties. 

  

 As used in this Agreement, " _Alternative Transaction_ " means any of (w) a transaction pursuant to which any person (or group of persons) (other than First Charter or its affiliates), directly or indirectly, acquires or would acquire more than 25% of the outstanding shares of GBC Common Stock or outstanding voting power or of any new series or new class of preferred stock that would be entitled to a class or series vote with respect to the Merger, whether from GBC or pursuant to a tender offer or exchange offer or otherwise, (x) a merger, share exchange, consolidation or other business combination involving GBC (other than the Merger), (y) any transaction pursuant to which any person (or group of persons) (other than First Charter or its affiliates) acquires or would acquire control of assets (including for this purpose the outstanding equity securities of subsidiaries of GBC and securities of the entity surviving any merger or business combination including any of GBCs Subsidiaries) of GBC, or any of its Subsidiaries representing more than 25% of the fair market value of all the assets, net revenues or net income of GBC and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, immediately prior to such transaction, or (z) any other consolidation, business combination, recapitalization or similar transaction involving GBC or any of its Subsidiaries, other than the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, as a result of which the holders of shares of GBC immediately prior to such transactions do not, in the aggregate, own at least 75% of the outstanding shares of common stock and the outstanding voting power of the surviving or resulting entity in such transaction immediately after the 

   ##### 

  

 

consummation thereof in substantially the same proportion as such holders held

   ##### 

  

 

of the Main Office Property and shall be final, dispositive and binding upon
the parties. GBC shall consult with First Charter during, and shall allow

unreasonably withheld or delayed) of the contract or any amendment
or addendum thereto, as the case may be, and all terms and conditions set
forth thereon. Nor shall GBC under any circumstances close the transaction to
acquire the Main Office Property without First Charters prior approval
(which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed) of the status
of the title and physical condition of the Main Office Property as disclosed
by standard due diligence including the review of: a current title commitment
and endorsements thereof; a current survey; current reports of physical

contemplated by this Agreement; 

   

 (c) _Delay_. By either GBC or First Charter, if the Merger shall not have been consummated on or before April 30, 2007 unless the failure of the Closing to occur by such date shall be due to the failure of the party seeking to terminate this Agreement to perform or observe the covenants and agreements of such party set forth in this Agreement; 

  

 (d) _Material Breach of Representation, Warranty or Covenant_. By either First Charter or GBC ( _provided_ that the terminating party is not then in material breach of any representation, warranty, covenant or other agreement contained herein), if there shall have been a breach of any of the covenants or agreements or any of the representations or warranties set forth in this Agreement on the part of GBC, in the case of a termination by First Charter, or First Charter, in the case of a termination by GBC, which breach, either individually or in the aggregate, would result in, if occurring or continuing on the Closing Date, the failure of the conditions set forth in _Section 7.2_ or _Section 7.3_, as the case may be, and which is not cured within 30 days following written notice to the party committing such breach or by its nature or timing cannot be cured within such time period;

Form of Affiliate Letter 

   

First Charter Corporation  

  

 _ _ _ _ _ _  

  

   

  

 _ _ _ _ _ _  

  

Ladies and Gentlemen:  

   

 I have been advised that as of the date hereof I may be deemed to be an "affiliate" of GBC Bancorp, Inc., a Georgia corporation (" _GBC_ "), as the term "affiliate" is defined for purposes of paragraphs (c) and (d) of Rule 145 of the rules and regulations (the " _Rules and Regulations_ ") of the Securities and Exchange Commission (the " _Commission_ ") under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the " _Act_ "). I have been further advised that pursuant to the terms of the Agreement and Plan of Merger dated as of June 1, 2006 (the " _Merger Agreement_ "), by and between First Charter Corporation, a North Carolina corporation (" _First Charter_ "), and GBC, GBC shall be merged with and into First Charter (the " _Merger_ "). All terms used in this letter but not defined herein shall have the meanings ascribed thereto in the Merger Agreement. 

  

 I represent, warrant and covenant to First Charter that in the event I receive any First Charter Common Stock as a result of the Merger: 

  

 (a) I shall not make any sale, transfer or other disposition of First Charter Common Stock in violation of the Act or the Rules and Regulations. 

  

 (b) I have carefully read this letter and the Merger Agreement and discussed its requirements and other applicable limitations upon my ability to sell, transfer or otherwise dispose of First Charter Common Stock to the extent I believed necessary with my counsel or counsel for GBC. 

  

 (c) I have been advised that the issuance of First Charter Common Stock to me pursuant to the Merger will be registered with the Commission under the Act on a Registration Statement on Form S-4. However, I have also been advised that, since at the time the Merger will be submitted for a vote of the shareholders of GBC I may be deemed to have been an affiliate of GBC and the distribution by me of First Charter Common Stock has not been registered under the Act, I may not sell, transfer or otherwise dispose of First Charter Common Stock issued to me in the Merger unless (i) such sale, transfer or other disposition has been registered under the Act, (ii) such sale, transfer or other disposition is made in conformity with the volume and other limitations of Rule 145 promulgated by the Commission under the Act or (iii) in the opinion of counsel reasonably acceptable to First Charter, such sale, transfer or other disposition is otherwise exempt from registration under the Act. 

  

 (d) I understand that First Charter is under no obligation to register the sale, transfer or other disposition of First Charter Common Stock by me or on my behalf under the Act or to 

   ##### 

  

 

take any other action necessary in order to make compliance with an exemption
from such registration available. 

   

 (e) I also understand that stop transfer instructions will be given to First Charters transfer agents with respect to First Charter Common Stock and that there will be placed on the certificates for First Charter Common Stock issued to me, or any substitutions therefor, a legend stating in substance: 

   

"The securities represented by this certificate have been issued in a
transaction to which Rule 145 promulgated under the Securities Act of 1933
applies and may only be sold or otherwise transferred in compliance with the
requirements of Rule 145 or pursuant to a registration statement under that
act or an exemption from such registration." 

  

 (f) I also understand that unless the transfer by me of my First Charter Common Stock has been registered under the Act or is a sale made in conformity with the provisions of Rule 145, First Charter reserves the right to put the following legend on the certificates issued to my transferee: 

   

"The shares represented by this certificate have not been registered under the
Securities Act of 1933 and were acquired from a person who received such
shares in a transaction to which Rule 145 promulgated under the Securities
Act of 1933 applies. The shares have been acquired by the holder not with a
view to, or for resale in connection with, any distribution thereof within
the meaning of the Securities Act of 1933 and may not be sold, pledged or
otherwise transferred except in accordance with an exemption from
the registration requirements of the Securities Act of 1933." 

  

 It is understood and agreed that the legends set forth above shall be removed by delivery of substitute certificates without such legend, and/or the issuance of a letter to First Charters transfer agent removing such stop transfer instructions, and the above restrictions on sale will cease to apply, if (A) one year (or such other period as may be required by Rule 145(d)(2) under the Securities Act or any successor thereto) shall have elapsed from the Closing Date and the provisions of such Rule are then available to me; or (B) if two years (or such other period as may be required by Rule 145(d)(3) under the Securities Act or any successor thereto) shall have elapsed from the Effective Time and the provisions of such Rule are then available to me; or (C) I shall have delivered to First Charter (1) a copy of a letter from the staff of the Commission, or an opinion of counsel in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to First Charter, or other evidence reasonably satisfactory to First Charter, to the effect that such legend and/or stop transfer instructions are not required for purposes of the Securities Act or (2) reasonably satisfactory evidence or representations that the securities represented by such certificates are being or have been transferred in a transaction made in conformity with the provisions of Rule 145 under the Securities Act or pursuant to an effective registration under the Securities Act. 

  

 I recognize and agree that the foregoing provisions also apply to (i) my spouse, (ii) any relative of mine or my spouse occupying my home, (iii) any trust or estate in which I, my spouse or any such relative owns at least 10% beneficial interest or of which any of us serves as trustee, executor or in any similar capacity and (iv) any corporate or other organization in which I, my 

   ##### 

  

 

spouse or any such relative owns at least 10% of any class of equity
securities or of the equity interest. 

   

 It is understood and agreed that this Letter Agreement shall terminate and be of no further force and effect if the Merger Agreement is terminated in accordance with its terms. 

  

 Execution of this letter should not be construed as an admission on my part that I am an "affiliate" of GBC as described in the first paragraph of this letter or as a waiver of any rights I may have to object to any claim that I am such an affiliate on or after the date of this letter.

Exhibit C 

   

EMPLOYMENT AGREEMENT 

   

 THIS EMPLOYMENT AGREEMENT (the "Agreement"), contingent on the consummation of the Merger (as defined below) and effective as of the Closing Date (as defined below), is made and entered into by and between First Charter Corporation ("First Charter"), a North Carolina corporation with its principal place of business in Charlotte, North Carolina, for and on its own behalf and in the interests of the surviving corporation in the Merger, First Charter Bank, a North Carolina corporation, and Larry D. Key ("Executive"), an individual residing in Gwinnett County, Georgia (collectively defined and referred to as the "Parties"). 

  

WITNESSETH: 

   

 WHEREAS, Executive is currently a shareholder and option holder of GBC Bancorp, Inc. ("GBC Bancorp") and an executive employee of GBC Bancorps wholly owned subsidiary, Gwinnett Banking Company ("GBC"), most recently serving as President, Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of the Board of GBC and GBC Bancorp; 

  

 WHEREAS, GBC Bancorp, its Board of Directors and, if and as approved, a majority of its shareholders, including Executive, desire to merge GBC Bancorp into First Charter in return for the Merger Consideration as defined in the Agreement and Plan of Merger by and among GBC Bancorp and First Charter (the "Merger Agreement"), to be effective on the Closing Date as defined in the Merger Agreement (the overall transaction for which is defined and referred to as the "Merger"); 

  

 WHEREAS, Executive is a valuable employee of GBC, and First Charter wishes Executive to remain employed with GBCs successor following the Merger to assist in the ongoing operations of the new organization and perform such duties and responsibilities as set forth in detail below; 

  

 WHEREAS, Executive, as a shareholder and option holder of GBC Bancorp, will receive significant personal consideration as a result of the Merger and, as additional consideration for Executives entering into this Agreement, and in recognition of Executives value to GBC and its successor, on the Closing Date Executive shall become employed by First Charter or its subsidiaries by way of the Merger and receive certain rights to retention pay and First Charter restricted shares as set forth in detail below; and 

  

 WHEREAS, as an express prior condition of the Merger and as a material inducement for First Charter to enter into the Merger Agreement, Executive has agreed to execute and be bound by this Agreement, wherein the Parties have endeavored to limit Executives future activities only to the extent necessary to protect First Charter and its subsidiaries from unfair post-Merger competition, to preserve for First Charter the value of the consideration given for GBC Bancorp shares, and to protect adequately the trade secrets and confidential and proprietary information of GBC Bancorp, its subsidiaries and First Charter and its subsidiaries; 

  

 NOW THEREFORE, in consideration of the mutual promises and covenants agreed to herein, the receipt and sufficiency of which are hereby acknowledged, the Parties agree as follows: 

  

 1. _Employment_. First Charter agrees to employ Executive by and through its subsidiaries during the Employment Term (as defined in Section 4 below), and Executive hereby accepts such employment and agrees to serve First Charter and its wholly owned subsidiary, GBC, or GBCs successor by way of merger with First Charter Bank (collectively, the "Bank"). 

  

 2. _Duties_. During the Employment Term (as defined in Section 4 below), Executive shall be employed, and Executive hereby agrees to serve, as Executive Vice President and Regional President of the Bank. As such, Executive shall have responsibilities, duties and authority reasonably accorded to, expected of, and consistent with Executives position as an Executive Vice President and Regional President. Executive shall also perform the duties and exercise the powers and functions that from time to time may be assigned or vested in him by the President and Chief Executive Officer of First Charter (the "President"), the Board of 

   ##### 

  

 

Directors of First Charter (the "Board") and/or the Board of Directors of
First Charters subsidiaries in relation to: (i) First Charter; and/or (ii)
any subsidiary or affiliated company of First Charter, including
responsibility for the management and operations of the Banks
GBC division. 

   

 Executive hereby accepts this employment upon the terms and conditions herein contained and agrees to devote substantially all of his business time, attention and best efforts to promote and further the business of First Charter and the Bank. Moreover, except as specifically authorized in advance by the President, Executive shall not, during the Employment Term (as defined in Section 4 below), be engaged as an employee or otherwise in any other business or commercial activity pursued for gain, profit or other pecuniary advantage. Nothing in the foregoing limitations shall be construed as prohibiting Executive from making personal investments in such form or manner as will neither require his services in the operation or affairs of the companies or enterprises in which such investments are made nor violate the terms of Sections 7-11 hereof; provided, however, that during the Employment Term (as defined in Section 4 below), Executive may not beneficially own the stock or options to acquire stock totaling more than 5% of the outstanding shares of any corporation or entity, or otherwise acquire or agree to acquire a significant present or future equity or other proprietorship interest, whether as a stockholder, partner, proprietor, or otherwise, with any enterprise, business or division thereof, that is engaged in Competitive Activity (as defined in Section 9 below) with First Charter and/or the Bank. The Parties further agree that such activities must not singly or in the aggregate prevent, unduly limit or materially interfere with Executives ability to perform his duties and responsibilities to First Charter and the Bank under this Agreement. 

  

 During the Employment Term, Executive shall also: 

   

 a. Comply with, execute and fulfill all lawful requests, instructions, policies and regulations made by the President, the Board or their authorized agents, included but not limited to general First Charter and/or Bank policies, rules and regulations applicable to First Charter and Bank employees; 

   

 b. Faithfully and loyally serve First Charter, the Bank and their subsidiaries and affiliated companies to the best of his ability and use his utmost endeavors to promote their interests in all respects; 

   

 c. Adhere faithfully to all applicable professional ethics and business practices, and follow and abide by all federal, state and municipal ordinances and laws relating to or regulating the business of First Charter, the Bank and their subsidiaries and affiliated companies; 

   

 d. Specifically adhere to the terms of First Charters Code of Business Conduct and Ethics, 

   

 e. Be fully and readily available to work on and perform his duties as assigned from time to time; and 

   

 f. Assist in the identification and transitioning of any successor to his position, as requested, pending the termination or end of his Employment Term as set forth in Section 4 below. 

  

 Notwithstanding the above duties, the President and/or the Board shall have the right to require Executive at any time during the Employment Term to carry out such special projects or functions commensurate with his abilities, employment position and status as Executive Vice President and Regional President of the Bank as the President and/or the Board shall in their absolute discretion determine. 

  

 3. _Compensation_. For all services rendered by Executive during the Employment Term (as defined in Section 4 below), First Charter shall compensate Executive as follows: 

   ##### 

  

   

 a. _Base Salary_. During the Employment Term (as defined in Section 4 below), First Charter will pay Executive a bi-weekly base salary as compensation for Executives services hereunder of $8,653.84, equivalent to $225,000.00 per year (the "Base Salary"), payable on a regular basis in accordance with First Charters standard payroll procedures but not less than monthly. On at least an annual basis thereafter during the Employment Term (as defined in Section 4 below), First Charter shall review Executives performance and, based upon the recommendation of the President, may increase such Base Salary if, in its discretion, such adjustment is warranted, with any such adjustment to be effective beginning January 1 of the next following year. 

   

 b. _Bonus._ During the Employment Term (as set forth in Section 4 below) for fiscal year 2006 and provided Executive remains actively employed by First Charter or its subsidiaries at the time of payment, Executive may receive an annual bonus for fiscal year 2006 in accordance with the bonus program then in existence with GBC immediately prior to the Merger, payable in January 2007\. In addition, during the Employment Term (as set forth in Section 4 below) beginning in fiscal year 2007 and provided Executive remains actively employed by First Charter or its subsidiaries at the time of the applicable payments, Executive shall receive an annual bonus from one or more arrangements including but not limited to the First Charter Annual Incentive Plan, if and as earned in accordance with the terms and conditions of such plans as they may be modified, changed or replaced from time to time (collectively, the "Bonus"). 

   

 During fiscal year 2007 of the Employment Term, the Parties agree that Executives maximum total target Bonus award opportunity shall be equal to 50% of Executives annual Base Salary. One-half of such target Bonus award opportunity shall be awarded if and as Executive meets the 2007 budget established for the GBC division of the Bank, and one-half of such target Bonus award opportunity shall be awarded if and as the Bank meets its overall 2007 corporate budget. The Parties further agree that Executives component Bonus award opportunity for fiscal year 2007 shall increase ratably if and as the GBC division of the Bank and/or the Bank exceed their respective 2007 budgets, as applicable. For example, if the GBC division exceeds its 2007 budget, then Executive would receive 25% of his 2007 Base Salary for meeting the 2007 GBC division budget, plus an additional percentage of his 2007 Base Salary equal to the percentage by which GBC exceeds its 2007 budget. During the Employment Term that follows fiscal year 2007, Executives potential Bonus shall be determined in the sole discretion of First Charter upon recommendation of the President. In making its determination of the amount of the Bonus, if any, to be paid, First Charter may take into account, among other things, Executives achievement of established individual, division and corporate goals. 

   

 c. _Restricted Stock._ As additional consideration for entering into this Agreement, following Executives employment with First Charter or its subsidiaries on the Closing Date, Executive shall be awarded restricted shares of First Charters common stock pursuant to the First Charter Restricted Stock Award Program. The value of the restricted shares awarded to Executive (based on the publicly traded price of First Charters common stock at the close of trading three (3) trading days before the Closing Date and irrespective of the restrictions associated with such restricted shares) shall be two times (2x) Executives annual Base Salary as set forth in Section 3.a. above, to be rounded down to the nearer whole share amount. The Parties further agree that the awarding of such restricted shares shall be made pursuant to the terms of a Restricted Stock Award Agreement to be executed in a form attached as Exhibit A (the "Award Agreement"), with the Restriction Period as defined in the Award Agreement to begin on the Closing Date and end on the third anniversary of the Closing Date (the "Restriction Period"). 

   

 In addition, if Executive experiences a Termination of Service (as defined in the Restricted Stock Award Program) before the end of the Restriction Period as a result of First Charters termination of Executive "Without Cause" (as defined below), the Parties agree that First Charter shall pay Executive an amount equal to the cash value of Executives restricted shares based on the publicly traded price of First Charters common stock as of the Termination of Service as if such shares had 

   ##### 

  

   

vested on a pro-rata basis through the effective date of such event
(calculated using as the numerator the number of days from the beginning of
the Restriction Period to the effective date of the Executives Termination
of Service, and as the denominator the number of days from the beginning of
the Restriction Period to the last day of the Restriction Period). However,
nothing in this Award Agreement shall in any way change
Executives employment status with First Charter, the Bank and/or their
subsidiaries, nor is it a guarantee of or a contract for continued employment
with such entities for a specific term or otherwise. 

   

 For the purpose of this Section 3.c., "Without Cause" shall have the meaning set forth in Section 5.e. below. 

   

 d. _Retention Payment._ As additional consideration for Executives entering into this Agreement, accepting the new employment terms outlined in it and agreeing to continue Executives employment with First Charter or its subsidiaries following the Merger notwithstanding and in lieu of the change in control provisions contained in Executives prior January 1, 2004 Employment Agreement with GBC Bancorp and GBC, as amended (the "GBC Employment Agreement"), First Charter agrees to pay Executive a total amount equal to $611,232. Such amount shall be divided into twenty-four (24) equal units of $25,468 (the "Units" or "Unit value"). 

   

 (i) _Payment of Retention Payment._ The Parties agree that such retention payment shall be paid within the twenty-four (24) month period following the Closing Date (the "Retention Period"). Specifically, on the Closing Date, First Charter shall pay Executive an amount equal to the Unit value, multiplied by the number of full and partial months remaining in the calendar year in which the Closing Date occurs. In the calendar year following the calendar year in which the Closing Date occurs, First Charter shall pay Executive an amount equal to the Unit value, multiplied by 12. Such payment shall be made on July 1st of such year. In addition, in the second calendar year following the calendar year in which the Closing Date occurs, First Charter shall pay Executive an amount equal to the Unit value, multiplied by the remaining number of Units. Such payment shall be made on the earlier of the last day of the Retention Period or July 1st of such year. 

   

 For example, if the Closing Date is in October 2006, First Charter would pay Executive for three (3) Units on the Closing Date in 2006, twelve (12) Units on July 1, 2007, and nine (9) Units on July 1, 2008. 

   

 (ii) _Repayment Obligation._ During the Retention Period, if Executive breaches any of the "Protective Covenants" contained in the GBC Employment Agreement or the additional obligations set forth in Sections 7-12 of this Agreement, then the retention payments pursuant to this Section 3.d. shall automatically end, and Executive shall also be required to refund to First Charter, and First Charter shall be entitled to recover from Executive an amount equal to the retention payment amount already received by Executive. 

   

 (iii) _Effect on GBC Employment Agreement._ The Parties further agree that GBC Bancorps, GBCs and/or First Charters obligations to Executive with respect to the change in control, severance and benefit payment provisions contained in the GBC Employment Agreement are hereby waived, replaced and superseded by this Section 3.d. 

   

 e. _Executive Perquisites, Benefits and Other Compensation._ During the Employment Term (as defined in Section 4 below), Executive shall be entitled to receive additional benefits and compensation from First Charter in such form and to such extent as specified below: 

   

 (i) _Insurance Benefits._ Payment of all or a portion of premiums for coverage for Executive and his dependent family members under health, hospitalization, disability, dental, 

   ##### 

  

   

life and other insurance plans that First Charter may have in effect as
such plans may be modified, amended and terminated from time to time in the
absolute and sole discretion of First Charter; provided that Executive is
otherwise eligible to participate in such plans and desires to be covered.
Benefits provided to Executive under this Section 3.e.(i) will require
Executive to pay the same proportion of premiums for, and shall provide
benefits at least equal to, the benefits then provided to First Charters
other executive employees. Moreover, nothing contained in this Agreement
shall be construed to obligate First Charter in any manner to put into effect
any plans not presently in existence or to provide special benefits
to Executive. 

   

 In addition, following the termination or end of the Employment Term for _any_  reason, the Parties agree that Executive shall be entitled to continued health insurance benefit coverage, as provided under COBRA, for himself and his eligible dependents under a plan or program sponsored by First Charter. Provided Executive complies with and continues to abide by the "Protective Covenants" contained in the GBC Employment Agreement and the non-competition, confidentiality and other requirements set forth in Sections 7-12 of this Agreement, First Charter shall reimburse Executive for Executives individual COBRA costs, but not that of his dependents, for the duration of such coverage. Following the period during which Executive is eligible for COBRA continuation coverage, Executive agrees to enroll in Medicare. Thereupon, and provided Executive complies with and continues to abide by the "Protective Covenants" contained in the GBC Employment Agreement and the non-competition, confidentiality and other requirements set forth in Sections 7-12 of this Agreement, First Charter shall provide Executive with, and pay all premiums for, a fully-insured Medicare supplement policy for himself, but not his dependents, for as long as Executive continues to receive benefits under his Executive Supplemental Retirement Agreement, dated October 20, 1999, as amended. However, if, following the end of such COBRA coverage, Executive is not eligible to enroll in Medicare, the Parties agree that Executive shall be entitled to continuation of health insurance benefit coverage for himself, but not his dependents, under such plan or program in which Executive was entitled to participate immediately prior to the end of such COBRA coverage, payable at First Charters expense, until Executive is eligible to enroll in Medicare, provided that such continued participation is permitted under the terms and provisions of such plan or program. If such continued participation is prohibited during the applicable coverage period, First Charter shall arrange to provide Executive with a fully insured, individual health care policy for himself, but not his dependents, during such coverage period, with such benefits being substantially similar to those that Executive would otherwise have been entitled to receive under such plans and programs from which his continued participation is prohibited. 

   

 (ii) _Expense Reimbursement._ Reimbursement for all business related travel, business entertainment and other out-of-pocket expenses reasonably incurred by Executive in the performance of his services pursuant to this Agreement. All reimbursable expenses shall be appropriately documented in reasonable detail by Executive upon submission of any request for reimbursement, and in a format and manner consistent with First Charters business expense and expense reporting policies. 

   

 (iii) _Car Allowance._ Payment of a $650.00 monthly car allowance, for use as Executive may deem appropriate, payable by First Charter to Executive in monthly installments. First Charter further agrees to reimburse Executive for all business related mileage expenses incurred by Executive in the performance of his services pursuant to this Agreement (normal commuting costs excluded). All reimbursable expenses shall be appropriately documented in reasonable detail by Executive in accordance with Section 3.e.(ii) above. 

   

 (iv) _Memberships/Dues._ Payment of Executives non-personal use related assessments, membership dues and regular service charge for membership in civic 

   ##### 

  

   

organizations/clubs and a hunting or country club, subject to advance
approval of the President, excluding non-business related dining charges,
donations and other extra expenses related to such memberships. All
reimbursable expenses shall be appropriately documented in reasonable detail
by Executive in accordance with Section 3.e.(ii) above. 

   

 (v) _ESRA._ Participation in the prior October 20, 1999 Executive Supplemental Retirement Agreement (ESRA) between Executive and GBC, as amended and as the same may be amended hereafter with the mutual consent of First Charge and GBC (which the Parties agree shall remain in full force and effect and shall be expressly assigned to First Charter as part of the Merger). 

   

 (vi) _Other Perquisites/Benefits._ Other employee perquisites and participation in such company-wide employee benefits as may be available to and deemed appropriate for Executive by First Charter. Exhibit B, which is attached hereto and incorporated herein, lists those supplemental benefits in which Executive is currently or later will be entitled to participate per such applicable plan terms, as they may be modified, amended, replaced or terminated from time to time in the absolute and sole discretion of First Charter. 

  

 4. _Term of Agreement_. Unless sooner terminated as provided in Section 5 below, and contingent on the consummation of the Merger, the Parties agree that Executive shall be employed by First Charter or its subsidiaries pursuant to this Agreement for a period beginning on the Closing Date and ending on the third anniversary of the Closing Date (the "Initial Period"). In addition, First Charter may but is not obligated to, by specific action and with the consent of Executive, extend the employment term of this Agreement or enter into a new agreement for an additional term beyond the Initial Period. Executives total term of employment pursuant to this Agreement during the Initial Period and any extended term is collectively defined and referred to under this Agreement as the "Employment Term." 

  

 5. _Termination_. In addition to the provisions set forth in Section 4 above, the Employment Term shall terminate immediately upon the occurrence of any of the following events: (a) immediately upon the Retirement or death of Executive; (b) upon the Disability of Executive (as defined below) and end of the elimination period specified in the long-term disability plan sponsored by First Charter; (c) upon the effective date of Resignation by Executive Without Good Reason (as defined below); (d) upon the effective date of Resignation by Executive For Good Reason (as defined below); (e) upon the 60th day following the date First Charter gives Executive notice of Termination Without Cause (as defined below); or (f) upon the close of business on the date First Charter gives Executive notice of Termination for Cause (as defined below). 

   

 a. _Suspension/Regulatory Removal._ The Parties acknowledge and agree that: 

   

 (i) If Executive is suspended and/or temporarily prohibited from participating in the conduct of the affairs of the Bank by a notice served under Sections 8(e)(3) or (g)(1) of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act, 12 U.S.C. § 1818(e)(3) or (g)(1), the obligations of First Charter and the Bank under this Agreement shall be suspended as of the date of service of such notice, unless stayed by appropriate proceedings. If the charges in the notice are dismissed, First Charter may in its discretion pay Executive all or part of the compensation withheld while its contract obligations were suspended and/or reinstate in whole or in part any of its obligations that were suspended. Vested rights of Executive shall not otherwise be affected. 

   

 (ii) If Executive is removed and/or permanently prohibited from participating in the conduct of the affairs of the Bank by an order issued under Section 8(e)(4) or (g)(1) of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act, 12 U.S.C. § 1818(e)(4) or (g)(1), all obligations of First Charter and the Bank under this Agreement shall terminate as of the effective date of the order, but vested rights of the Parties hereto shall not be affected. 

   ##### 

  

   

 In addition, the Parties agree that without expressly or constructively terminating this Agreement, First Charter may place Executive on temporary leave with pay, temporarily exclude him from any premises of First Charter or any First Charter subsidiary, and/or temporarily reassign Executives duties during any pending investigation or disciplinary action involving Executive and/or Executives potential "Termination for Just Cause" (as defined in Section 5.f. below). The Parties further agree such authority shall be invoked only in exceptional circumstances when the President determines that such action is in the best interests of First Charter. 

   

 b. _Retirement._ "Retirement by Executive" shall mean any voluntary retirement by Executive with the consent of First Charter. 

   

 c. _Disability_. "Disability" shall mean the inability of Executive to perform the essential functions and duties of Executives position with First Charter, with or without reasonable accommodation, by reason of any medically determinable physical or mental impairment which can be expected to result in death or which is to last or can be expected to last for a continuous period of not less than twelve months, as determined under the long-term disability plan sponsored by First Charter in which Executive participates. 

   

 d. _Resignation by Executive_. For purposes of this Agreement, "Resignation by Executive" shall mean any termination or resignation by Executive of his employment relationship with First Charter, the Bank or their subsidiaries, including but not limited to Retirement by Executive. Executive is required to give at least sixty (60) days advance written notice of resignation to the President, and First Charter is entitled upon receiving such notice, in its discretion, to accept such resignation as effective on the resignation date proposed by Executive, or such other earlier date designated by First Charter. In addition, except as otherwise set forth in Section 6 below, First Charter will be required to pay Executive his Base Salary and other applicable accrued, non-forfeited compensation or other vested benefits only through Executives final resignation date as agreed to or revised by First Charter, regardless of whether Executives final resignation date is revised/accelerated by First Charter, and regardless of whether Executive is actually required or permitted to perform any services for First Charter during such final transition period. 

   

 Resignation by Executive for "Good Reason" shall mean resignation for the following events: (i) a material reduction in Executives position, duties, responsibilities or status, or a change in Executives title resulting in a material reduction in his responsibilities or position with the Bank, in either case without Executives consent, but excluding for this purpose any suspensions, removals, duty reassignments or other actions as set forth and allowed in Section 5.a. above or any isolated, insubstantial and inadvertent action not taken in bad faith and which is remedied promptly by First Charter after receiving notice from Executive, and further excluding any such reductions or changes made in good faith to conform with generally accepted industry standards for Executives position; or (ii) a reduction in the rate of Executives Base Salary without Executives consent. The Parties further agree that for a resignation to constitute resignation by Executive for "Good Reason", in addition to the advance notice of resignation requirement generally set forth above for this Section 5.d., Executive must provide written notice to the President of Executives intent to resign _within_ sixty (60) days of one of the triggering events outlined in subsections (i)-(ii) of this paragraph. 

   

 "Resignation Without Good Reason" shall mean any voluntary termination or resignation by Executive for any reason other than death, "Disability" or "Resignation for Good Reason". 

   

 e. _Termination Without Cause_. "Termination Without Cause" shall mean any termination of the employment of Executive by First Charter for any reason other than termination due to the Retirement or death of Executive, "Disability" or "Termination for Cause".

 f. _Termination For Cause_. "Termination for Cause" shall mean termination of the employment of Executive by First Charter as the result of Executives: (i) willful misconduct of a material nature in connection with the performance of his duties under this Agreement; (ii) use of alcohol during working hours beyond that customarily authorized in the performance of Executives job duties, repeated use of alcohol after working hours that materially interferes with Executives duties under this Agreement, use of illegal drugs, or violation of First Charters drug and/or alcohol policies; (iii) conviction, guilty plea or plea of _nolo contendere_ for any crime involving moral turpitude or for any felony; (iv) embezzlement or theft from First Charter, the Bank, any other subsidiary or affiliated company of First Charter, or any of their respective customers and employees; (v) gross inattention to or dereliction of duty; (vi) commission or omission of any act of fraud or dishonesty in connection with Executives employment under this Agreement; (vii) the regulatory suspension or removal of Executive as defined in Section 5.a.(i) or 5.a.(ii); (viii) breach of any fiduciary duty to First Charter or the Bank, including the duty of loyalty; (ix) insubordination or Executives unwillingness to carry out or meet the lawful instructions, performance criteria and other supervisory goals established or given by the President and/or the Board from time to time; (x) breach or threatened breach of the obligations set forth in Sections 7-12 of this Agreement; (xi) breach, threatened breach or failure to perform any other provision of this Agreement; or (xii) performance of any other willful act(s) which Executive knew or reasonably should have known would be materially detrimental to First Charter, the Bank and/or any other subsidiary or affiliated company of First Charter. 

  

 6. _Effect of Termination/Severance_. Following the termination or end of the Employment Term for _any_ reason, Executive shall: (i) be entitled to any earned but unpaid Base Salary, if any, due at the time of the termination or end of the Employment Term, (ii) be entitled to any non-forfeited amounts earned that may be payable to Executive pursuant to the terms of the First Charter Annual Incentive Plan; (iii) have the general right to elect certain coverage continuation under COBRA, provided he is and remains eligible therefor; (iv) be entitled to post-termination health insurance coverage continuation as set forth in Section 3.e.(i) above; (v) be entitled to any vested stock options or vested 401(k), pension, retirement or deferred compensation benefits with First Charter and the Bank, if any; (vi) be entitled to any accrued, vested benefits pursuant to the terms of any other plans or programs in which Executive is a participant, if any; and (vii) be entitled to reimbursement of all reasonable business expenses incurred by Executive prior to the termination or end of the Employment Term (collectively, the "Regular Compensation"). Thereafter, except as otherwise provided for in accordance with the incentive and benefit plan terms referenced in Section 3 above, and except for any additional benefits or payments that may be due as set forth in this Section 6 below, Executive and/or his estate, as applicable, shall not be entitled to receive any additional compensation, wages, bonuses, incentive pay, commissions, severance pay, equity interests, options, consideration or benefits of any kind from First Charter and/or the Bank hereunder upon the termination or end of the Employment Term, nor shall Executive or his estate be entitled to receive reimbursement for business expenses incurred after the end of the Employment Term. However: 

   

 a. _Death_. If termination of the Employment Term occurs at any time due to the death of Executive, then in addition to the Regular Compensation set forth above, Executives estate or legal representative shall be paid an amount representing one (1) years Base Salary, to be paid at the same time and in the same manner as provided in Section 3\. In addition, all supplemental benefits, awards, grants and options under any First Charter or Bank supplemental agreement, stock option or grant will be fully vested notwithstanding any other provision in such plan or grant. 

   

 b. _Disability._ If termination of the Employment Term occurs at any time due to the Disability of Executive, then in addition to the Regular Compensation set forth above, Executive shall be entitled to receive an additional amount representing one (1) years Base Salary, such amount to be paid at the same time and in the same manner as provided in Section 3, _less_ any amounts which Executive receives from First Charters long-term disability plan and/or supplemental disability income plan. 

   ##### 

  

   

 c. _Termination "Without Cause" or Resignation "For Good Reason"_. 

   

 (1) If termination of this Agreement occurs at any time during the Employment Term due to termination by First Charter "Without Cause" or resignation by Executive "For Good Reason" that do _not_ occur within twelve (12) months following a "Change in Control", then in addition to the Regular Compensation set forth above, Executive shall be entitled to continued payment of Executives Base Salary for the  _lesser_ of the remainder of the Employment Term immediately prior to the termination/resignation _or_ twenty-four (24) months. 

   

 (2) If termination of this Agreement occurs at any time during the Employment Term due to termination by First Charter or its successor "Without Cause" or resignation by Executive "For Good Reason", either of which occur _within_  twelve (12) months following a "Change in Control" (as defined below), then in addition to the Regular Compensation set forth above, Executive shall be entitled to continued payment of Executives Base Salary for a period of twenty-four (24) months. 

   

 For purposes of this Section 6.c.(2), termination by Executive for "Good Reason" shall mean those reasons set forth as "Good Reason" in Section 5.d. above, except that the change in Executives position, duties, responsibilities, status, title, or Base Salary shall be measured for such matters as they were in effect immediately preceding the Change in Control. 

  

 "Change in Control" shall mean (A) the consummation of a merger, consolidation, share exchange or similar transaction of First Charter with any other corporation as a result of which the holders of the voting capital stock of First Charter as a group would receive less than 50% of the voting capital stock of the surviving or resulting corporation; (B) the sale or transfer (other than as security for obligations of First Charter) of substantially all the assets of First Charter; (C) in the absence of a prior expression of approval by the Board, the acquisition of more than 35% of First Charters voting capital stock by any person within the meaning of Section 13(d)(3) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act"), other than a person, or group including a person, who beneficially owned, as of the date of this Agreement, more than 5% of First Charters securities; or (D) during any twelve-month period, individuals who at the beginning of such period constitute the Board cease for any reason to constitute at least a majority thereof unless the election, or the nomination for election by First Charters shareholders, of each new director was approved by a vote of at least two-thirds of the directors then still in office who were directors at the beginning of the period. 

  

 The payment of the "Without Cause", "For Good Reason" and "Disability" severance amounts and healthcare continuation benefits set forth in this Section 6 above shall be treated by the Parties as severance pay/benefits available to assist Executive in transitioning to other employment. As such, all such severance pay/benefit amounts are expressly conditioned upon the expectation that and provided Executives future employment and other activities do not violate the obligations set forth in the "Protective Covenants" contained in the GBC Employment Agreement and the non-competition, confidentiality and other requirements set forth in Sections 7-12 of this Agreement. In the event of any such breach, then the severance payments and healthcare continuation benefits set forth in this Section 6 shall automatically end. Moreover, in exchange for and as a further condition precedent to receiving such severance pay/benefits, Executive agrees that upon his separation, he must sign a release of any and all claims that Executive has or may have against First Charter and its subsidiaries, and such entities past and then current officers, directors and employees relating to or arising out of his employment with First Charter, the Bank and/or their subsidiaries and their respective predecessors (under this Agreement or otherwise), in a form to be prepared by First Charter at such time. 

  

 It is the intention of First Charter and Executive that Executive receive the full benefits available under this Section 6 in the event of a Change in Control, subject, however, to the limitation on such distributions imposed by section 280G of the Internal Revenue Code. If a Change of Control occurs and a determination is made that the aggregate amount of any amount otherwise payable to Executive hereunder, when combined with payments made or anticipated under other plans, programs and policies of First Charter arising in connection 

   ##### 

  

 

with a Change in Control, would constitute an "excess parachute payment" (as
defined in Internal Revenue Code section 280G) that is subject to the excise
tax provisions of Internal Revenue Code section 4999, the aggregate amount
payable to Executive shall not include any such "excess parachute payment".
Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the Internal Revenue Service determines
that Executive has, in fact, received an amount that constitutes an "excess
parachute payment" and if First Charter determines that the payment of such
amount is due to its own miscalculation under Internal Revenue Code section
280G, then Executive shall be entitled to receive from First Charter, in
addition to any other amounts payable hereunder, a lump sum payment equal to
100% of such excise tax under Internal Revenue Code section 4999, plus an
amount equal to the federal and state income tax, FICA, and Medicare taxes
(based on Executives projected marginal income tax rates) on such lump sum
payment. Such amounts shall be paid to Executive as soon as may be practicable
after such final determination is made by the Internal Revenue Service.
Executive and First Charter shall mutually and reasonably determine whether
or not such determination has occurred and/or whether any appeal to such
determination should be made. 

   

 The Parties further acknowledge that if Executive is determined to be a "specified employee" as such term is defined in section 409A of the Internal Revenue Code upon the termination of the Employment Term, that certain payments to Executive under this Section 6 may be required to be postponed to comply with section 409A. Thus, the Parties agree that, in such event, any payments that are so postponed will be paid to Executive on the first day of the calendar month following the end of the required postponement period. 

  

 Except as elected by Executive with the prior consent of First Charter, all payments provided for under this Section 6 shall be paid in cash (including the cash values of stock options or restricted stock, if any) from the general funds of First Charter, and no special or separate fund shall be established, and no other segregation of assets shall be made to assure payment, except as provided to the contrary in funded benefits plans. Executive shall have no right, title or interest whatsoever in or to any investments that First Charter may make to aid First Charter in meeting its obligations under this Section 6\. Nothing contained herein, and no action taken pursuant to the provisions hereof, shall create or be construed to create a trust of any kind or a fiduciary relationship between First Charter and Executive or any other person. To the extent that any person acquires a right to receive payments from First Charter hereunder, such right shall be no greater than the right of an unsecured creditor of First Charter. 

  

 7. _Covenant Not to Disclose Confidential Information_. 

   

 a. Executive understands that his position with First Charter and the Bank is one of trust and confidence because of Executives access to trade secrets and confidential and proprietary business information. Executive pledges his best efforts and utmost diligence to protect and keep confidential the trade secrets and confidential or proprietary business information of First Charter and its subsidiaries. 

   

 b. Unless required by First Charter in connection with his employment under this Agreement or with First Charters express written consent, Executive agrees that he will not, either during his employment under this Agreement or afterwards, directly or indirectly, use, misappropriate, disclose or aid anyone else in disclosing to any third party for Executives own benefit or the benefit of another: (1) all or any part of any of First Charters or its subsidiaries trade secrets or confidential or proprietary information, whether or not the information is acquired, learned, or developed by Executive alone or in conjunction with others; or (2) the details of any contracts, business transactions or negotiations to which First Charter or its subsidiaries are a party or of any tenders, offer or proposals submitted to or to be submitted by First Charter and/or its subsidiaries in connection with their business. Executive makes the same pledge with regard to the confidential information of First Charters and its subsidiaries customers, contractors, or others with whom First Charter or its subsidiaries have a business relationship. Executive further acknowledges and agrees that his confidentiality and other obligations under this Section 7 shall extend to GBC and any trade secret or confidential or proprietary GBC information acquired, learned, or developed by Executive during his employment with GBC prior to the Merger. 

   ##### 

  

   

 c. Trade secrets and confidential or proprietary information, for purposes of this Agreement, shall include, but not be limited to, any and all versions of First Charters or its subsidiaries computer software, hardware, and documentation; all methods, processes, techniques, practices, product designs, pricing information, billing histories, customer requirements, customer lists, account data, loan records, employee lists and salary/commission information, personnel matters, financial data, operating results, contractual relationships, and projections for business opportunities for new or developing business of First Charter or its subsidiaries; and all other confidential or proprietary information, patents, ideas, know-how and trade secrets which are in the possession of First Charter or its subsidiaries, no matter what the source, including any such information that First Charter or its subsidiaries obtain from a customer, contractor or another party or entity and that First Charter treats or designates as confidential or proprietary information, whether or not such information is owned or was developed by First Charter. Confidential information, however, shall not mean or apply to any information or materials to the extent that the same (i) is now in, or later enters, the public domain through no fault of Executive, (ii) was known to Executive before the disclosure by First Charter, the Bank or GBC, (iii) was rightfully obtained by Executive from a third party in rightful possession of such information other than via First Charter, the Bank or GBC, or (iv) is compelled by court order or other judicial process to be disclosed by Executive. 

   

 d. Executive also agrees that all notes, records (including all computer and electronic records), software, drawings, handbooks, manuals, policies, contracts, memoranda, sales files, customer lists, employee lists or other documents that are made or compiled by Executive, or which were available to Executive while he was employed under this Agreement, in whatever form, including but not limited to all such documents and data concerning any processes, inventions, services or products used or developed by Executive during his prior employment with GBC before the Merger or his subsequent employment with First Charter, the Bank and/or their subsidiaries, shall be the property of First Charter. Executive further agrees to deliver and make available all such documents and data to First Charter, regardless of how stored or maintained and including all originals, copies and compilations thereof, upon the separation of his employment under this Agreement, for any reason, or at any other time at First Charters request. 

   

 e. Executive understands that First Charter expects him to respect any trade secrets or confidential information of any of Executives former employers, business associates, or other business relationships. Executive also agrees to respect First Charters express direction to Executive not to disclose to First Charter, its officers, or any of its employees any such information so long as it remains confidential. 

  

 8. _Conflicts of Interest_. Throughout Executives employment under this Agreement, Executive shall not be engaged in providing any services, either as an employee or independent contractor, with or without compensation, to any other person or entity engaged in the business of the sale, distribution or provision of banking, financial, commercial lending or insurance products or services or any other business that is competitive to that which is then being conducted by First Charter, the Bank or their subsidiaries, now or in the future. 

  

 9. _Covenant Not to Compete_. Executive agrees that for a period of twenty-four (24) months after Executives employment under this Agreement has terminated or ended (whatever the reason for the end of the employment relationship), Executive shall not either individually or as an employee, agent or consultant engage in any Competitive Activity (as defined below) within the Prohibited Territory (as defined below). 

  

 "Competitive Activity" means the sale, distribution or provision, or attempted sale, distribution or provision, of banking, financial or commercial lending products or services other than on behalf of First Charter, the Bank or their subsidiaries. 

   ##### 

  

  

 "Prohibited Territory" means: (i) Gwinnett County, Georgia; and/or (ii) the counties contiguous to Gwinnett County, Georgia. Executive acknowledges and agrees that Executives business conducted with GBC prior to the Closing Date or to be conducted for First Charter or the Bank after the Closing Date, occurred (or in the case of First Charter and the Bank, will occur) within the scope of such counties. 

  

 10. _Agreement Not To Interfere With Business_. For a period of twenty-four (24) months after Executives employment under this Agreement has terminated or ended (whatever the reason for the end of the employment relationship), Executive shall not: 

   

 a. Solicit, encourage, cause, or attempt to cause any supplier of goods or services to First Charter, the Bank or their subsidiaries not to do business with, to discontinue doing, or to reduce or transfer all or any part of their business with First Charter, the Bank or their subsidiaries; and/or 

   

 b. Solicit, call upon, divert or contact or attempt to solicit, call upon, divert or contact any then current Company Customer (as defined below) for the purpose of engaging in any Competitive Activity (as defined in Section 9 above). 

  

 "Company Customer" means any company or individual client/customer of First Charter, the Bank or GBC: (i) who contacted Executive or whom Executive contacted or served as part of his prior employment with GBC before the Merger and/or his subsequent employment with First Charter and/or the Bank within Executives last twenty-four months as a First Charter, Bank or GBC employee; or (ii) who is a prospective customer of First Charter, the Bank or GBC solicited or contacted by Executive within his last twenty-four months as a First Charter, Bank or GBC employee. 

  

 11. _Agreement Not to "Raid" or Engage Employees_. For a period of twenty-four (24) months after Executives employment under this Agreement has terminated or ended (whatever the reason for the end of the employment relationship), Executive shall not for the purpose of providing banking, financial or commercial lending services, whether on behalf of any other entity or on his own behalf solicit, encourage, support or cause any employee then presently employed by First Charter, the Bank or their subsidiaries with whom Executive had contact in the course of his employment during Executives last twelve months as a First Charter, Bank or GBC employee to leave the employment of First Charter, the Bank or their subsidiaries. 

  

 12. _Acknowledgments by Executive_. 

   

 a. Executive acknowledges that the restrictions placed upon him by Sections 7-11 of this Agreement are reasonable and necessary given the nature of his past and current positions with First Charter, the Bank and GBC, the area in which First Charter, the Bank and GBC market their products and services, and the consideration provided by First Charter and the Bank to him pursuant to this Agreement and the Merger. Executive acknowledges that the length of the noncompete and nonsolicitation periods are reasonable and that the definitions of Competitive Activity, Company Customer and Prohibited Territory are reasonable. 

   

 b. Executive acknowledges that all of the provisions of the Agreement are fair and necessary to protect the interests of First Charter and the Bank. Accordingly, Executive agrees not to contest the validity or enforceability of Sections 7-11 hereof. 

   

 c. Executive understands that every provision of this Agreement is severable from each other provision of this Agreement. Therefore, if any provision of this Agreement, including but not limited to all provisions of Sections 7-11, is held invalid or unenforceable, every other provision of this Agreement will continue to be fully valid and enforceable. In the event that any provision of this Agreement is determined by a court of competent jurisdiction to be void or unenforceable, Executive and First Charter agree that such provision shall be enforced to the extent reasonable under the circumstances and that all other provisions shall be enforceable to the fullest extent permissible by law. 

   ##### 

  

   

Executive and First Charter further agree that, if any court makes such
a determination, such court shall have the power to reduce the duration,
scope and/or area of such provisions and/or delete specific words and phrases
by "blue penciling" and, in its reduced or blue penciled form, such
provisions shall then be enforceable as allowed by law. 

   

 d. Executive understands that his obligations under Sections 7-11 of this Agreement will continue whether or not his employment under this Agreement is terminated voluntarily or involuntarily, or with or without Cause or Good Reason. 

  

 13. _Breach by Executive_. Executive agrees that in the event of any breach or threatened breach of the provisions of Sections 7-12 hereof by Executive, First Charters and the Banks remedies at law would be inadequate, and First Charter and/or the Bank shall be entitled to an injunction (without any bond or other security being required), restraining such breach, and costs and attorneys fees relating to any such proceeding or any other legal action to enforce the provisions of this Agreement, but nothing herein shall be construed to preclude First Charter and/or the Bank from pursuing any other remedies at law or in equity available to them for any such breach or threatened breach. Moreover, Executive also agrees that if Executive breaches any of Sections 7-12 above, Executive shall forfeit at the time of the breach the right to any additional future payments or benefits under this Agreement, except to the extent such benefits or payments are vested and earned. In such case, Executive and First Charter agree that the confidential information and non-compete obligations contained in this Agreement shall remain valid and enforceable based upon the consideration actually paid. 

  

 14. _Assignment and Binding Effect_. This Agreement shall be binding upon, and inure to the benefit of, Executive and First Charter and the Bank and their respective permitted successors and assigns. Neither this Agreement nor any right or interest hereunder shall be assignable by Executive, his beneficiaries, or legal representatives without the First Charters prior written consent. First Charter will require any successor (whether direct or indirect, by purchase, merger, consolidation, share exchange or otherwise) to all or substantially all of the business and/or assets of First Charter, by agreement in form and substance satisfactory to Executive, to expressly assume and agree to perform all of First Charters obligations under this Agreement in the same manner and to the same extent that First Charter would be required to perform it if no such succession had taken place, and to perform all obligations to Executive as provided in Section 6. Failure of First Charter to obtain such agreement prior to the effectiveness of any such succession shall be a breach of this Agreement and shall entitle Executive to compensation from First Charter in the same amount and on the same terms as he would be entitled to hereunder if he terminated his employment for Good Reason, except that for purposes of implementing the foregoing, the date on which any such succession becomes effective shall be deemed the date Executives employment was terminated. As used in this Agreement, "First Charter" shall mean First Charter as defined herein and any successor to its business and/or assets as aforesaid that executes and delivers the agreement provided for in this Section 14 or that otherwise becomes bound by the all terms and provisions of this Agreement by operation of law. 

  

 15. _Entire Agreement_. With the exception of the "Protective Covenants" and related enforcement/interpretation terms contained in the GBC Employment Agreement (which the Parties agree shall remain in full force and effect and are hereby expressly assigned as part of the Merger to First Charter), this Agreement (including the recitals, which are hereby incorporated by reference) and the Award Agreement to be separately executed by the Parties on the Closing Date will, upon commencement of its term as described in Section 4 above contingent on the consummation of the Merger, constitute the entire agreement and understanding among the Parties pertaining to the subject matters contained herein _and replace and supersede any and all prior and contemporaneous agreements, representations and understandings of the Parties, including but not limited to the GBC Employment Agreement_. This Agreement may not be later modified except by a further writing signed by a duly authorized officer of First Charter and Executive, and no term of this Agreement may be waived except by writing signed by the party waiving the benefit of such term. A valid waiver of any provision of this Agreement shall be limited to the instance received in such writing and, unless otherwise expressly stated, shall not be effective as a continuing waiver or repeal of such provision.

 17. _Taxes/Estate_. This Agreement is intended to comply with Internal Revenue Code section 409A to the extent that section is applicable, and it shall be interpreted in a manner that complies with such section to the fullest extent possible. In addition, the Parties agree that First Charter and the Bank shall have the power to adjust the timing or other details relating to the awards and/or payments described in this Agreement if First Charter and the Bank determine that such adjustments are necessary in order to comply with or become exempt from the requirements of section 409A. Executive understands and agrees that except as otherwise expressly set forth above with respect to certain Internal Revenue Code section 280G payments referenced in Section 6, he is responsible for any federal or state tax liability, penalties, excise taxes, interest, tax payments or tax judgments against him that could arise as a result of this Agreement. In addition, Executive agrees that he has had the opportunity to consult with his own, independent accountant and/or counsel regarding any and all tax issues related to this Agreement. Executive also agrees that First Charter, the Bank, GBC, their respective parent and subsidiary companies, and their respective officers, employees, accountants, attorneys and agents are in no way indemnifying or making any representation, statement or guarantee to Executive as to Executives past, current or future tax liability or the ultimate position that the IRS or any applicable state tax agency may take with respect to the tax treatment of Executives prior or future wages, payments, compensation and benefits, including those payments, awards and provisions set forth in this Agreement. 

  

 The Parties agree that all compensation, plan, benefit and potential severance or other payments to Executive set forth in this Agreement, if and as applicable, will be subject to all withholdings and deductions required by law or as authorized by Executive, as appropriate, and First Charter will report such amounts set forth in this Agreement as W-2 income for the applicable tax year(s) in which they are received, if and as applicable or as otherwise required by law. The Parties further agree that in the event of Executives death, any applicable severance, change in control pay or other vested or accrued, non-forfeited compensation or benefit payments outlined in this Agreement will be paid to Executives estate or legal representative, in accordance with the above terms, if and as applicable and otherwise eligible in accordance with applicable program, plan and benefit terms. 

  

 18. _Headings_. The section headings herein are for reference purposes only and are not intended in any way to describe, interpret, define or limit the extent or intent of the Agreement or of any part hereof. 

  

 19. _Governing Law_. _This Agreement shall be construed in accordance with the laws of the State of North Carolina (without regard to its conflict-of-laws provisions)._ Executive further agrees that any litigation under this Agreement may be brought by First Charter and/or the Bank in the State of North Carolina or the State of Georgia notwithstanding that he may not be a resident of either state when the litigation is commenced and/or cannot be served process within such states. Executive also irrevocably consents to the 

   ##### 

  

 

jurisdiction of the courts of North Carolina and Georgia (whether federal or
state) for all disputes with First Charter and/or the Bank that concern this
Agreement. 

   

 IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the Parties have executed this Agreement as of the day and year first above written.

 _RETENTION AGREEMENT_  

   

 THIS RETENTION AGREEMENT (the "Agreement"), contingent on the consummation of the Merger (as defined below) and effective as of the Closing Date (as defined below), is made and entered into by and between KATRINA M.

 WHEREAS, Employee is a valuable employee of GBC, and First Charter wishes Employee to remain employed with GBCs successor following the Merger to assist in the ongoing operations of the new organization and perform such duties and responsibilities as set forth below; 

  

 WHEREAS, Employee, as a shareholder and/or option holder of GBC Bancorp, will receive significant personal consideration as a result of the Merger and, as additional consideration for Employees entering into this Agreement, and in recognition of Employees value to GBC and its successor, on the Closing Date Employee shall become employed by the Company and/or its subsidiaries by way of the Merger and receive certain rights to Company restricted shares as set forth in detail below; 

  

 WHEREAS, as an express prior condition of the Merger and as a material inducement for the Company to enter into the Merger Agreement, Employee has agreed to execute and be bound by this Agreement, wherein the Parties have endeavored to limit Employees future activities only to the extent necessary to protect the Company and its subsidiaries from unfair post-Merger competition, to preserve for the Company the value of the consideration given for GBC Bancorp shares, and to protect adequately the trade secrets and confidential and proprietary information of GBC Bancorp, its subsidiaries and the Company and its subsidiaries during and after Employees employment with the Company and/or its subsidiaries; 

  

 NOW THEREFORE, in consideration of the mutual promises and covenants agreed to herein, the receipt and sufficiency of which are hereby acknowledged, the Parties agree as follows: 

  

 1. _Appointment_. Effective on the Closing Date, Employee shall be designated and appointed to act and perform services on behalf of the Company as Senior Vice President, SBA Lender of the Companys then wholly owned subsidiary, GBC, or GBCs successor by way of merger with First Charter Bank (collectively, the "Bank"), and shall perform and serve in such future duties, responsibilities and positions as may be assigned to Employee from time to time. Employee hereby accepts such employment and agrees to devote her full professional time, attention, and best effort to the business of the Company, the Bank and their subsidiaries in the carrying out of her employment responsibilities. 

  

 2. _Compensation_. During Employees employment with the Bank, Employee shall be compensated for her services at an initial biweekly base salary rate of $4,542.63, equivalent to $118,108.38 per year, plus commission pursuant to the terms of Employees current incentive commission program with GBC as of the date of this Agreement, less applicable withholdings and pursuant to the procedures established by the Bank. Employee shall also be entitled to participate in management incentives, bonuses and benefits applicable to Employees position in such form, manner and times as the Bank may from time to time establish for its employees or specified 

   ##### 

  

 

classes of employees in its sole discretion and in accordance with the terms
of such benefits/plans, as they may be established, modified, replaced or
terminated from time to time. 

   

 3. _Restricted Stock_. As additional consideration for entering into this Agreement, following Employees employment by the Bank and/or the Company on the Closing Date, Employee shall be awarded restricted shares of the Companys common stock pursuant to the Companys Restricted Stock Award Program. The value of the restricted shares awarded to Employee (based on the publicly traded price of the Companys common stock at the close of trading three (3) trading days before the Closing Date and irrespective of the restrictions associated with such restricted shares) shall be three times (3x) Employees annual base salary as set forth in Section 2 above, to be rounded down to the nearer whole share amount. The Parties further agree that the awarding of such restricted shares shall be made pursuant to the terms of a Restricted Stock Award Agreement to be executed in a form attached as Exhibit A (the "Award Agreement"), with the Restriction Period as defined in the Award Agreement to begin on the Closing Date and end on the third anniversary of the Closing Date (the "Restriction Period"). 

  

 In addition, if Employee experiences a Termination of Service (as defined in the Restricted Stock Award Program) before the end of the Restriction Period as a result of First Charters discontinuance of its Small Business Administration lending business or First Charters involuntary termination of Employee without "Cause" (as defined below), the Parties agree that First Charter shall pay Employee an amount equal to the cash value of Employees restricted shares based on the publicly traded price of the Companys common stock as of the Termination of Service as if such shares had vested on a pro-rata basis through the effective date of such event (calculated using as the numerator the number of days from the beginning of the Restriction Period to the effective date of the Employees Termination of Service, and as the denominator the number of days from the beginning of the Restriction Period to the last day of the Restriction Period). Nothing in this Agreement or the Award Agreement shall in any way change Employees employment status with the Bank and/or the Company, which shall be at-will, nor are they a guarantee of or a contract for continued employment with the Bank and/or the Company, for a specific term or otherwise. 

  

 For the purpose of this Agreement, "Cause" shall mean (a) willful misconduct of a material nature by Employee in connection with the performance of Employees employment duties under this Agreement; (b) use of alcohol or narcotics that affects Employees ability to perform Employees employment duties under this Agreement; (c) Employees conviction of a serious misdemeanor involving moral turpitude or a felony; (d) embezzlement or theft by Employee from the Company or any of its subsidiaries; (e) Employees gross inattention to or dereliction of duty; (f) Employees commission or omission of an act of fraud or dishonesty in connection with Employees employment under this Agreement; (g) Employees breach of any fiduciary duty to the Company or any of its subsidiaries, including the duty of loyalty; or (h) performance by Employee of any other willful act which Employee knew or reasonably should have known would be materially detrimental to the Company or any of its subsidiaries. 

  

 4. _Conflicts of Interest_. Throughout Employees employment with the Bank, Employee shall not be engaged in providing any services, either as an employee or independent contractor, with or without compensation, to any other person or entity engaged in the business of the sale, distribution or provision of banking, financial, commercial lending or insurance products or services or any other business that is competitive to that which is then being conducted by the Company, the Bank or their subsidiaries, now or in the future. 

  

 5. _Non-Competition Agreement_. If Employees employment with the Bank terminates or ends at any time during the Restriction Period (whatever the reason for the end of the employment relationship), then for the remainder of the Restriction Period or a period of twelve (12) months after Employees employment with the Bank has terminated or ended, whichever is _lesser_ , Employee shall not either individually or as an employee, agent or consultant engage in any Competitive Activity (as defined below) within the Prohibited Territory (as defined below). 

   #####

 6. _Agreement Not To Interfere With Business_. If Employees employment with the Bank terminates or ends at any time during the Restriction Period (whatever the reason for the end of the employment relationship), then for the remainder of the Restriction Period or a period of twelve (12) months after Employees employment with the Bank has terminated or ended, whichever is  _lesser_ , Employee shall not: 

   

 (a) Solicit, encourage, cause, or attempt to cause any supplier of goods or services to the Company, the Bank or their subsidiaries not to do business with, to discontinue doing, or to reduce or transfer all or any part of their business with the Company, the Bank or their subsidiaries; and/or

 8. _Acknowledgement_. Employee acknowledges that the restrictions placed upon her by Sections 4-7 of this Agreement are reasonable and necessary given the nature of her past and current positions with the Company, the Bank and GBC, the area in which the Company, the Bank and GBC market their products and services, and the consideration provided by the Company and the Bank to her pursuant to this Agreement and the Merger. Employee acknowledges that the length of the noncompete and nonsolicitation periods are reasonable and that the definitions of Competitive Activity, Company Customer and Prohibited Territory are reasonable. Employee further agrees not to contest the validity or enforceability of Sections 4-7 of this Agreement. 

  

 Notwithstanding the above, if Employees employment with the Bank terminates or ends at any time as a result of: (a) First Charters discontinuance of its Small Business Administration lending business; (b) First Charters involuntary termination of Employee without "Cause" (as defined in Section 3 above); (c) Employees resignation due to the relocation of Employees assigned workplace with the Bank to a location that is more than fifty (50) miles from Employees current assigned branch with GBC as of the date of this Agreement, without Employees consent; or (d) Employees resignation due to a reduction in the rate of Employees base salary or a change in Employees incentive commission program set forth or referenced in Section 1 above, without

In addition, for and in consideration of this Agreement, Employee further agrees to the following for the protection of the Company and its subsidiaries and affiliates:

 (b) "Confidential Information" means confidential or proprietary business or technical information furnished to or obtained by Employee within the course of her prior employment with GBC before the Merger or her subsequent employment with the Bank (including, without limitation, information created, discovered, developed or made known by Employee), whether such information is in the form of data, forecasts, records, reports or other documents. 

  

 Confidential Information includes, by way of illustration, but is not limited to: (i) any Company, Bank or GBC information regarding any Company, Bank or GBC customer or account (including any "Company Customer" as that term is defined above), including, but not limited to, customer lists, contracts, requirements, billing histories, marketing methods, and products or services provided by the Company, the Bank or GBC to such customers or accounts; (ii) all non-public financial information concerning the Company, the Bank, GBC or their subsidiaries and affiliates, including, but not limited to, financial statements, balance sheets, profit and loss statements, earnings, commissions and salaries paid to employees, sales data and projections, cost analyses and similar information; (iii) all plans and projections for business opportunities for new or developing business of the Company, the Bank, GBC or their subsidiaries and affiliates; (iv) all information relating to the Companys, the Banks or GBCs prices, costs, research and development activities, service performance, operating results, employee lists, personnel matters and other confidential or proprietary information, designs, patents, ideas, inventions and trade secrets; and (v) any of the information described in subsections (i)-(iv) of this paragraph that the Company, the Bank or GBC obtain from another party or entity and that the Company, the Bank or GBC treat or designate as confidential or proprietary information, whether or not such information is owned or was developed by the Company, the Bank or GBC. 

  

 Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the prior two paragraphs, "Confidential Information," however, shall not mean or apply to any information or materials to the extent that the same (i) is now in, or later enters, the public domain through no fault of Employee, (ii) was known to Employee before the disclosure by the Company, the Bank or GBC, (iii) was rightfully obtained by Employee from a third party in rightful possession of such information other than via the Company, the Bank or GBC, or (iv) is compelled by court order or other judicial process to be disclosed by Employee. 

  

 10. _Enforcement_. In the event of any breach or threatened breach of this Agreement by Employee, the Company and/or the Bank shall be entitled to seek an injunction, without bond, restraining such breach, but nothing herein shall be construed as prohibiting the Company or the Bank from pursuing other remedies available to them. The Company and/or the Bank shall be entitled to their costs and attorneys fees relating to any such proceeding or any other legal action to enforce the terms of this Agreement. In addition, all remedies available to the Company and the Bank by reason of a breach or threatened breach by Employee of any of the provisions of this Agreement 

   ##### 

  

 

are cumulative, none is exclusive, and all remedies may be exercised
concurrently or consecutively at the Companys and the Banks option.
Employee also agrees that the Company and the Bank may disclose this
Agreement to any person or entity who, at any time during
Employees employment with the Bank or during the period in which the
noncompete, nonsolicitation and confidentiality provisions of this Agreement
are in effect, employs or considers employing or retaining the services of
Employee. 

   

 11. _Governing Law_. _This Agreement shall be construed in accordance with the laws of the State of North Carolina (without regard to its conflict-of-laws provisions)._ Employee further agrees that any litigation under this Agreement may be brought by the Company and/or the Bank in the State of North Carolina or the State of Georgia notwithstanding that she may not be a resident of either state when the litigation is commenced and/or cannot be served process within such states.

 12. _Successors and Assigns_. This Agreement shall be binding on and inure to the benefit of the Parties and their respective successors, assigns, heirs and personal representatives. Employee may not assign or delegate any of her rights, obligations, title or interest in this Agreement. The Company and the Bank may without Employees consent assign this Agreement to any affiliate or any successor to the Companys and the Banks business or a part thereof, by sale, merger or otherwise. 

  

 13. _Severability_. Every provision and subsection of this Agreement is severable from each other provision or subsection of this Agreement. If any part of the covenants, provisions or subsections contained in this Agreement is determined by a court of competent jurisdiction or by any arbitration panel to which a dispute is submitted to be invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced, the validity of the other provisions and subsections of this Agreement shall not be impaired. If any provision or subsection of this Agreement shall be deemed invalid as to its scope, then notwithstanding such invalidity, that provision or subsection shall be deemed valid to the fullest extent permitted by law, and the Parties agree that, if any court or panel makes such a determination, it shall have the power to reduce the duration, scope or area of such provisions or subsections and to delete specific words and phrases by "blue penciling" and, in its reduced or blue-penciled form, such provisions and subsections shall then be enforceable as allowed by law. 

  

 14. _Taxes_. This Agreement is intended to comply with Internal Revenue Code section 409A to the extent that section is applicable, and it shall be interpreted in a manner that complies with such section to the fullest extent possible. The Parties agree that the Company and the Bank shall have the power to adjust the timing or other details relating to the awards and/or payments described in this Agreement if the Company and the Bank determine that such adjustments are necessary in order to comply with or become exempt from the requirements of section 409A. The Parties further acknowledge that if Employee is determined to be a "specified employee" as such term is defined in section 409A of the Internal Revenue Code upon the termination or end of Employees employment with the Bank, that certain payments to Employee under this Agreement may be required to be postponed to comply with section 409A. Thus, the Parties agree that, in such event, any payments that are so postponed will be paid to Employee on the first day of the calendar month following the end of the required postponement period. Employee understands and agrees that she is responsible for any federal or state tax liability, penalties, excise taxes, interest, tax payments or tax judgments against her that could arise as a result of this Agreement. In addition, Employee agrees that she has had the opportunity to consult with her own, independent accountant and/or counsel regarding any and all tax issues related to this Agreement. Employee also agrees that the Company, the Bank, GBC, their respective parent and subsidiary companies, and their respective officers, employees, accountants, attorneys and agents are in no way indemnifying or making any representation, statement or guarantee to Employee as to Employees past, current or future tax liability or the ultimate position that the IRS or any applicable state tax agency may take with respect to the tax treatment of Employees prior or future wages, payments, compensation and benefits, including those payments, awards and provisions set forth in this Agreement. 

  

 15. _Entire Agreement_. This Agreement (including the recitals, which are hereby incorporated by reference) and the Award Agreement to be separately executed by the Parties on the Closing Date will, upon 

   ##### 

  

 

commencement of its term as described in Section 1 above contingent on the
consummation of the Merger, constitute the entire agreement and understanding
among the Parties pertaining to the subject matters contained herein and
replace and supersede any and all prior and contemporaneous agreements,
representations and understandings of the Parties. This Agreement may not be
later modified except by a further writing signed by a duly authorized
officer of the Company, the Bank and Employee, and no term of this Agreement
may be waived except by writing signed by the party waiving the benefit of
such term. A valid waiver of any provision of this Agreement shall be limited
to the instance received in such writing and, unless otherwise expressly
stated, shall not be effective as a continuing waiver or repeal of such
provision. 

   

 IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the Company and the Bank have caused this Agreement to be executed by their duly authorized and proper officer, and Employee has set her hand and seal this the ___ day of ____________, 2006.

If Employees employment with the Bank terminates or ends at any time during the Restriction Period (whatever the reason for the end of the employment relationship), then for the remainder of the Restriction Period or a period of twelve (12) months after Employees employment with the Bank has terminated or ended, whichever is  _lesser_ , Employee shall not for the purpose of providing banking, financial, commercial lending or insurance services, whether on behalf of any other entity or on his own behalf solicit, encourage, support or cause any employee then presently employed by First Charter, the Bank or their subsidiaries with whom Employee had contact in the course of his employment during Employees last twelve months as a Bank or GBC employee to leave the employment of First Charter, the Bank or their subsidiaries. 

  

 8. _Acknowledgement_. Employee acknowledges that the restrictions placed upon him by Sections 4-7 of this Agreement are reasonable and necessary given the nature of his past and current positions with the Company, the Bank and GBC, the area in which the Company, the Bank and GBC market their products and services, and the consideration provided by the Company and the Bank to him pursuant to this Agreement and the Merger. Employee acknowledges that the length of the noncompete and nonsolicitation periods are reasonable and that the definitions of Competitive Activity, Company Customer and Prohibited Territory are reasonable. Employee further agrees not to contest the validity or enforceability of Sections 4-7 of this Agreement. 

  

 9. _Company Information/Confidentiality_. Employee agrees that he will return upon the Companys or the Banks request at any time (and, in any event, before the last day of his employment with the Bank) all documents, written material, information, products, devices and other property belonging to the Company, the Bank or their subsidiaries, including but not limited to GBC, as well as all documents and other materials of any kind that constitute or contain any Confidential Information (as defined below), in Employees possession or control, regardless of how stored or maintained, including all originals, copies and compilations and all information stored or maintained on computer, tapes, discs or any other form of technology. In addition, for and 

   ##### 

  

 

in consideration of this Agreement, Employee further agrees to the following
for the protection of the Company and its subsidiaries and affiliates: 

    

 (a) During Employees employment with the Bank and for a period of five (5) years thereafter, Employee will not, without prior written approval by the General Counsel of the Company: (i) misappropriate, (ii) disclose to any third party, either directly or indirectly, or (iii) aid anyone else in disclosing to any third party, either directly or indirectly, all or any part of any Confidential Information. 

   

 (b) "Confidential Information" means confidential or proprietary business or technical information furnished to or obtained by Employee within the course of his prior employment with GBC before the Merger or his subsequent employment with the Bank (including, without limitation, information created, discovered, developed or made known by Employee), whether such information is in the form of data, forecasts, records, reports or other documents. 

  

 Confidential Information includes, by way of illustration, but is not limited to: (i) any Company, Bank or GBC information regarding any Company, Bank or GBC customer or account (including any "Company Customer" as that term is defined above), including, but not limited to, customer lists, contracts, requirements, billing histories, marketing methods, and products or services provided by the Company, the Bank or GBC to such customers or accounts; (ii) all non-public financial information concerning the Company, the Bank, GBC or their subsidiaries and affiliates, including, but not limited to, financial statements, balance sheets, profit and loss statements, earnings, commissions and salaries paid to employees, sales data and projections, cost analyses and similar information; (iii) all plans and projections for business opportunities for new or developing business of the Company, the Bank, GBC or their subsidiaries and affiliates; (iv) all information relating to the Companys, the Banks or GBCs prices, costs, research and development activities, service performance, operating results, employee lists, personnel matters and other confidential or proprietary information, designs, patents, ideas, inventions and trade secrets; and (v) any of the information described in subsections (i)-(iv) of this paragraph that the Company, the Bank or GBC obtain from another party or entity and that the Company, the Bank or GBC treat or designate as confidential or proprietary information, whether or not such information is owned or was developed by the Company, the Bank or GBC. 

  

 Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the prior two paragraphs, "Confidential Information," however, shall not mean or apply to any information or materials to the extent that the same (i) is now in, or later enters, the public domain through no fault of Employee, (ii) was known to Employee before the disclosure by the Company, the Bank or GBC, (iii) was rightfully obtained by Employee from a third party in rightful possession of such information other than via the Company, the Bank or GBC, or (iv) is compelled by court order or other judicial process to be disclosed by Employee. 

  

 10. _Enforcement_. In the event of any breach or threatened breach of this Agreement by Employee, the Company and/or the Bank shall be entitled to seek an injunction, without bond, restraining such breach, but nothing herein shall be construed as prohibiting the Company or the Bank from pursuing other remedies available to them. The Company and/or the Bank shall be entitled to their costs and attorneys fees relating to any such proceeding or any other legal action to enforce the terms of this Agreement. In addition, all remedies available to the Company and the Bank by reason of a breach or threatened breach by Employee of any of the provisions of this Agreement are cumulative, none is exclusive, and all remedies may be exercised concurrently or consecutively at the Companys and the Banks option. Employee also agrees that the Company and the Bank may disclose this Agreement to any person or entity who, at any time during Employees employment with the Bank or during the period in which the noncompete, nonsolicitation and confidentiality provisions of this Agreement are in effect, employs or considers employing or retaining the services of Employee. 

  

 11. _Governing Law_. _This Agreement shall be construed in accordance with the laws of the State of North Carolina (without regard to its conflict-of-laws provisions)._ Employee further agrees that any litigation under this Agreement may be brought by the Company and/or the Bank in the State of North Carolina or the State of Georgia notwithstanding that he may not be a resident of either state when the litigation is commenced and/or 

   ##### 

  

 

cannot be served process within such states. Employee also irrevocably
consents to the jurisdiction of the courts of North Carolina and Georgia
(whether federal or state) for all disputes with the Company and/or the Bank
that concern this Agreement. 

   

 12. _Successors and Assigns_. This Agreement shall be binding on and inure to the benefit of the Parties and their respective successors, assigns, heirs and personal representatives. Employee may not assign or delegate any of his rights, obligations, title or interest in this Agreement. The Company and the Bank may without Employees consent assign this Agreement to any affiliate or any successor to the Companys and the Banks business or a part thereof, by sale, merger or otherwise. 

  

 13. _Severability_. Every provision and subsection of this Agreement is severable from each other provision or subsection of this Agreement. If any part of the covenants, provisions or subsections contained in this Agreement is determined by a court of competent jurisdiction or by any arbitration panel to which a dispute is submitted to be invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced, the validity of the other provisions and subsections of this Agreement shall not be impaired. If any provision or subsection of this Agreement shall be deemed invalid as to its scope, then notwithstanding such invalidity, that provision or subsection shall be deemed valid to the fullest extent permitted by law, and the Parties agree that, if any court or panel makes such a determination, it shall have the power to reduce the duration, scope or area of such provisions or subsections and to delete specific words and phrases by "blue penciling" and, in its reduced or blue-penciled form, such provisions and subsections shall then be enforceable as allowed by law. 

  

 14. _Taxes_. This Agreement is intended to comply with Internal Revenue Code section 409A to the extent that section is applicable, and it shall be interpreted in a manner that complies with such section to the fullest extent possible. The Parties agree that the Company and the Bank shall have the power to adjust the timing or other details relating to the awards and/or payments described in this Agreement if the Company and the Bank determine that such adjustments are necessary in order to comply with or become exempt from the requirements of section 409A. The Parties further acknowledge that if Employee is determined to be a "specified employee" as such term is defined in section 409A of the Internal Revenue Code upon the termination or end of Employees employment with the Bank, that certain payments to Employee under this Agreement may be required to be postponed to comply with section 409A. Thus, the Parties agree that, in such event, any payments that are so postponed will be paid to Employee on the first day of the calendar month following the end of the required postponement period. Employee understands and agrees that he is responsible for any federal or state tax liability, penalties, excise taxes, interest, tax payments or tax judgments against him that could arise as a result of this Agreement. In addition, Employee agrees that he has had the opportunity to consult with his own, independent accountant and/or counsel regarding any and all tax issues related to this Agreement. Employee also agrees that the Company, the Bank, GBC, their respective parent and subsidiary companies, and their respective officers, employees, accountants, attorneys and agents are in no way indemnifying or making any representation, statement or guarantee to Employee as to Employees past, current or future tax liability or the ultimate position that the IRS or any applicable state tax agency may take with respect to the tax treatment of Employees prior or future wages, payments, compensation and benefits, including those payments, awards and provisions set forth in this Agreement. 

  

 15. _Entire Agreement_. This Agreement (including the recitals, which are hereby incorporated by reference) and the Award Agreement to be separately executed by the Parties on the Closing Date will, upon commencement of its term as described in Section 1 above contingent on the consummation of the Merger, constitute the entire agreement and understanding among the Parties pertaining to the subject matters contained herein and replace and supersede any and all prior and contemporaneous agreements, representations and understandings of the Parties. This Agreement may not be later modified except by a further writing signed by a duly authorized officer of the Company, the Bank and Employee, and no term of this Agreement may be waived except by writing signed by the party waiving the benefit of such term. A valid waiver of any provision of this Agreement shall be limited to the instance received in such writing and, unless otherwise expressly stated, shall not be effective as a continuing waiver or repeal of such provision.
