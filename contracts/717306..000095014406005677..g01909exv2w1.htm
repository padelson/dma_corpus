otherwise cause the shares of common stock of GBC Bancorp, Inc owned beneficially by such

calculating a quorum, and each Shareholder shall execute and deliver to the Company written
consents with respect to, or to vote its Shares: (a)&nbsp;in favor of the approval and adoption of the
Merger Agreement (or any amended version thereof), the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated thereby, (b)&nbsp;against any action or agreement that is or would be reasonably likely to
result in any condition to the Company&#146;s obligations or the Buyer&#146;s obligations under the Merger
Agreement not being fulfilled and (c)&nbsp;against any Alternative Proposal.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1.2 <U><B>Irrevocable Proxy</B></U>. Each Shareholder hereby revokes any and all previous proxies

consent or dissent, or otherwise to utilize such voting power in the manner contemplated by
<U>Section&nbsp;1.1</U> as Buyer or its proxy or substitute shall, in Buyer&#146;s sole discretion, deem
proper with respect to its Shares. Each Shareholder hereby confirms that the proxy granted by such
Shareholder pursuant to this <U>Article&nbsp;1</U> is, subject to the last sentence of this <U>Section
1.2</U>, irrevocable and is coupled with an interest, and is granted in consideration of Buyer
entering into this Agreement and the Merger Agreement. If any Shareholder fails for any reason to
consent or vote its Shares in accordance with the requirements of <U>Section&nbsp;1.1</U> above (or
anticipatorily breaches such section), then Buyer shall have the right to consent or vote such
Shareholder&#146;s Shares in accordance with the provisions of <U>Section&nbsp;1.1</U>. The proxy granted
by each Shareholder shall be revoked upon termination of this Agreement in accordance with its
terms.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">Ladies and Gentlemen:

</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have been advised that as of the date hereof I may be deemed to be an &#147;affiliate&#148; of GBC
Bancorp, Inc., a Georgia corporation (&#147;<U>GBC</U>&#148;), as the term &#147;affiliate&#148; is defined for
purposes of paragraphs (c)&nbsp;and (d)&nbsp;of Rule&nbsp;145 of the rules and regulations (the &#147;<U>Rules and
Regulations</U>&#148;) of the Securities and Exchange Commission (the &#147;<U>Commission</U>&#148;) under the
Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the &#147;<U>Act</U>&#148;). I have been further advised that pursuant
to the terms of the Agreement and Plan of Merger dated as of June&nbsp;1, 2006 (the &#147;<U>Merger
Agreement</U>&#148;), by and between First Charter Corporation, a North Carolina corporation (&#147;<U>First
Charter</U>&#148;), and GBC, GBC shall be merged with and into First Charter (the &#147;<U>Merger</U>&#148;). All
terms used in this letter but not defined herein shall have the meanings ascribed thereto in the
Merger Agreement.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I represent, warrant and covenant to First Charter that in the event I receive any First
Charter Common Stock as a result of the Merger:
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)&nbsp;I shall not make any sale, transfer or other disposition of First Charter Common Stock in
violation of the Act or the Rules and Regulations.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)&nbsp;I have carefully read this letter and the Merger Agreement and discussed its requirements
and other applicable limitations upon my ability to sell, transfer or otherwise dispose of First
Charter Common Stock to the extent I believed necessary with my counsel or counsel for GBC.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c)&nbsp;I have been advised that the issuance of First Charter Common Stock to me pursuant to the
Merger will be registered with the Commission under the Act on a Registration Statement on Form
S-4. However, I have also been advised that, since at the time the Merger will be submitted for a
vote of the shareholders of GBC I may be deemed to have been an affiliate of GBC and the
distribution by me of First Charter Common Stock has not been registered under the Act, I may not
sell, transfer or otherwise dispose of First Charter Common Stock issued to me in the Merger unless
(i)&nbsp;such sale, transfer or other disposition has been registered under the Act, (ii)&nbsp;such sale,
transfer or other disposition is made in conformity with the volume and other limitations of Rule
145 promulgated by the Commission under the Act or (iii)&nbsp;in the opinion of counsel reasonably
acceptable to First Charter, such sale, transfer or other disposition is otherwise exempt from
registration under the Act.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(d)&nbsp;I understand that First Charter is under no obligation to register the sale, transfer or
other disposition of First Charter Common Stock by me or on my behalf under the Act or to

transfer agents with respect to First Charter Common Stock and that there will be placed on the

otherwise transferred in compliance with the requirements of Rule&nbsp;145 or pursuant to a

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(f)&nbsp;I also understand that unless the transfer by me of my First Charter Common Stock has been

Act of 1933 and were acquired from a person who received such shares in a transaction to
which Rule&nbsp;145 promulgated under the Securities Act of 1933 applies. The shares have been
acquired by the holder not with a view to, or for resale in connection with, any
distribution thereof within the meaning of the Securities Act of 1933 and may not be sold,
pledged or otherwise transferred except in accordance with an exemption from the
registration requirements of the Securities Act of 1933.&#148;
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is understood and agreed that the legends set forth above shall be removed by delivery of
substitute certificates without such legend, and/or the issuance of a letter to First Charter&#146;s
transfer agent removing such stop transfer instructions, and the above restrictions on sale will
cease to apply, if (A)&nbsp;one year (or such other period as may be required by Rule&nbsp;145(d)(2) under
the Securities Act or any successor thereto) shall have elapsed from the Closing Date and the
provisions of such Rule are then available to me; or (B)&nbsp;if two years (or such other period as may
be required by Rule&nbsp;145(d)(3) under the Securities Act or any successor thereto) shall have elapsed
from the Effective Time and the provisions of such Rule are then available to me; or (C)&nbsp;I shall
have delivered to First Charter (1)&nbsp;a copy of a letter from the staff of the Commission, or an
opinion of counsel in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to First Charter, or other
evidence reasonably satisfactory to First Charter, to the effect that such legend and/or stop
transfer instructions are not required for purposes of the Securities Act or (2)&nbsp;reasonably

Company (&#147;GBC&#148;), most recently serving as President, Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of the
Board of GBC and GBC Bancorp;
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>WHEREAS</B>, GBC Bancorp, its Board of Directors and, if and as approved, a majority of its
shareholders, including Executive, desire to merge GBC Bancorp into First Charter in return for the
Merger Consideration as defined in the Agreement and Plan of Merger by and among GBC Bancorp and
First Charter (the &#147;Merger Agreement&#148;), to be effective on the Closing Date as defined in the
Merger Agreement (the overall transaction for which is defined and referred to as the &#147;Merger&#148;);

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>WHEREAS</B>, Executive is a valuable employee of GBC, and First Charter wishes Executive to remain

Charter to enter into the Merger Agreement, Executive has agreed to execute and be bound by this
Agreement, wherein the Parties have endeavored to limit Executive&#146;s future activities only to the
extent necessary to protect First Charter and its subsidiaries from unfair post-Merger competition,
to preserve for First Charter the value of the consideration given for GBC Bancorp shares, and to
protect adequately the trade secrets and confidential and proprietary information of GBC Bancorp,
its subsidiaries and First Charter and its subsidiaries;
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>NOW THEREFORE</B>, in consideration of the mutual promises and covenants agreed to herein, the

at the time of payment, Executive may receive an annual bonus for fiscal year 2006 in
accordance with the bonus program then in existence with GBC immediately prior to the
Merger, payable in January&nbsp;2007. In addition, during the Employment Term (as set forth in
Section&nbsp;4 below) beginning in fiscal year 2007 and provided Executive remains actively
employed by First Charter or its subsidiaries at the time of the applicable payments,
Executive shall receive an annual bonus from one or more arrangements including but not

terms and conditions of such plans as they may be modified, changed or replaced from time to
time (collectively, the &#147;Bonus&#148;).

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt; margin-left: 3%">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During fiscal year 2007 of the Employment Term, the Parties agree that Executive&#146;s
maximum total target Bonus award opportunity shall be equal to 50% of Executive&#146;s annual
Base Salary. One-half of such target Bonus award opportunity shall be awarded if and as
Executive meets the 2007 budget established for the GBC division of the Bank, and one-half
of such target Bonus award opportunity shall be awarded if and as the Bank meets its overall
2007 corporate budget. The Parties further agree that Executive&#146;s component Bonus award
opportunity for fiscal year 2007 shall increase ratably if and as the GBC division of the
Bank and/or the Bank exceed their respective 2007 budgets, as applicable. For example, if
the GBC division exceeds its 2007 budget, then Executive would receive 25% of his 2007 Base
Salary for meeting the 2007 GBC division budget, plus an additional percentage of his 2007
Base Salary equal to the percentage by which GBC exceeds its 2007 budget. During the
Employment Term that follows fiscal year 2007, Executive&#146;s potential Bonus shall be
determined in the sole discretion of First Charter upon recommendation of the President. In
making its determination of the amount of the Bonus, if any, to be paid, First Charter may
take into account, among other things, Executive&#146;s achievement of established individual,
division and corporate goals.

following Executive&#146;s employment with First Charter or its subsidiaries on the Closing Date,
Executive shall be awarded restricted shares of First Charter&#146;s common stock pursuant to the
First Charter Restricted Stock Award Program. The value of the restricted shares awarded to
Executive (based on the publicly traded price of First Charter&#146;s common stock at the close
of trading three (3)&nbsp;trading days before the Closing Date and irrespective of the
restrictions associated with such restricted shares) shall be two times (2x) Executive&#146;s
annual Base Salary as set forth in Section&nbsp;3.a. above, to be rounded down to the nearer
whole share amount. The Parties further agree that the awarding of such restricted shares
shall be made pursuant to the terms of a Restricted Stock Award Agreement to be executed in
a form attached as Exhibit&nbsp;A (the &#147;Award Agreement&#148;), with the Restriction Period as defined

Executive has, in fact, received an amount that constitutes an &#147;excess parachute payment&#148; and if
First Charter determines that the payment of such amount is due to its own miscalculation under

shall be established, and no other segregation of assets shall be made to assure payment, except as
provided to the contrary in funded benefits plans. Executive shall have no right, title or
interest whatsoever in or to any investments that First Charter may make to aid First Charter in
meeting its obligations under this Section&nbsp;6. Nothing contained herein, and no action taken
pursuant to the provisions hereof, shall create or be construed to create a trust of any kind or a

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>WHEREAS</B>, Employee is currently a shareholder and/or option holder of GBC Bancorp, Inc. (&#147;GBC
Bancorp&#148;) and an employee of GBC Bancorp&#146;s wholly owned subsidiary, Gwinnett Banking Company
(&#147;GBC&#148;), most recently serving as Senior Vice President, SBA Lender for GBC;

shareholders, including Employee, desire to merge GBC Bancorp into the Company in return for the
Merger Consideration as defined in the Agreement and Plan of Merger by and among GBC Bancorp and
the Company (the &#147;Merger Agreement&#148;), to be effective on the Closing Date as defined in the Merger
Agreement (the overall transaction for which is defined and referred to as the &#147;Merger&#148;);
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>WHEREAS</B>, Employee is a valuable employee of GBC, and First Charter wishes Employee to remain
employed with GBC&#146;s successor following the Merger to assist in the ongoing operations of the new
organization and perform such duties and responsibilities as set forth below;
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>WHEREAS</B>, Employee, as a shareholder and/or option holder of GBC Bancorp, will receive
significant personal consideration as a result of the Merger and, as additional consideration for
Employee&#146;s entering into this Agreement, and in recognition of Employee&#146;s value to GBC and its
successor, on the Closing Date Employee shall become employed by the Company and/or its
subsidiaries by way of the Merger and receive certain rights to Company restricted shares as set
forth in detail below;
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>WHEREAS</B>, as an express prior condition of the Merger and as a material inducement for the
Company to enter into the Merger Agreement, Employee has agreed to execute and be bound by this
Agreement, wherein the Parties have endeavored to limit Employee&#146;s future activities only to the
extent necessary to protect the Company and its subsidiaries from unfair post-Merger competition,
to preserve for the Company the value of the consideration given for GBC Bancorp shares, and to
protect adequately the trade secrets and confidential and proprietary information of GBC Bancorp,
its subsidiaries and the Company and its subsidiaries during and after Employee&#146;s employment with
the Company and/or its subsidiaries;
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>NOW THEREFORE</B>, in consideration of the mutual promises and covenants agreed to herein, the
receipt and sufficiency of which are hereby acknowledged, the Parties agree as follows:

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>1.&nbsp;</B><U><B>Appointment</B></U><B>. </B>Effective on the Closing Date, Employee shall be designated and
appointed to act and perform services on behalf of the Company as Senior Vice President, SBA Lender
of the Company&#146;s then wholly owned subsidiary, GBC, or GBC&#146;s successor by way of merger with First
Charter Bank (collectively, the &#147;Bank&#148;), and shall perform and serve in such future duties,
responsibilities and positions as may be assigned to Employee from time to time. Employee hereby
accepts such employment and agrees to devote her full professional time, attention, and best effort
to the business of the Company, the Bank and their subsidiaries in the carrying out of her
employment responsibilities.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>2.&nbsp;</B><U><B>Compensation</B></U><B>. </B>During Employee&#146;s employment with the Bank, Employee shall be
compensated for her services at an initial biweekly base salary rate of $4,542.63, equivalent to
$118,108.38 per year, plus commission pursuant to the terms of Employee&#146;s current incentive
commission program with GBC as of the date of this Agreement, less applicable withholdings and
pursuant to the procedures established by the Bank. Employee shall also be entitled to participate
in management incentives, bonuses and benefits applicable to Employee&#146;s position in such form,

following Employee&#146;s employment by the Bank and/or the Company on the Closing Date, Employee shall
be awarded restricted shares of the Company&#146;s common stock pursuant to the Company&#146;s Restricted
Stock Award Program. The value of the restricted shares awarded to Employee (based on the publicly
traded price of the Company&#146;s common stock at the close of trading three (3)&nbsp;trading days before
the Closing Date and irrespective of the restrictions associated with such restricted shares) shall
be three times (3x) Employee&#146;s annual base salary as set forth in Section&nbsp;2 above, to be rounded
down to the nearer whole share amount. The Parties further agree that the awarding of such
restricted shares shall be made pursuant to the terms of a Restricted Stock Award Agreement to be
executed in a form attached as Exhibit&nbsp;A (the &#147;Award Agreement&#148;), with the Restriction Period as
defined in the Award Agreement to begin on the Closing Date and end on the third anniversary of the

Stock Award Program) before the end of the Restriction Period as a result of First Charter&#146;s
discontinuance of its Small Business Administration lending business or First Charter&#146;s involuntary
termination of Employee without &#147;Cause&#148; (as defined below), the Parties agree that First Charter
shall pay Employee an amount equal to the cash value of Employee&#146;s restricted shares based on the
publicly traded price of the Company&#146;s common stock as of the Termination of Service as if such
shares had vested on a pro-rata basis through the effective date of such event (calculated using as
the numerator the number of days from the beginning of the Restriction Period to the effective date
of the Employee&#146;s Termination of Service, and as the denominator the number of days from the

Agreement, wherein the Parties have endeavored to limit Employee&#146;s future activities only to the
extent necessary to protect the Company and its subsidiaries from unfair post-Merger competition,
to preserve for the Company the value of the consideration given for GBC Bancorp shares, and to
protect adequately the trade secrets and confidential and proprietary information of GBC Bancorp,
its subsidiaries and the Company and its subsidiaries during and after Employee&#146;s employment with
the Company and/or its subsidiaries;

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>NOW THEREFORE</B>, in consideration of the mutual promises and covenants agreed to herein, the

the Closing Date and irrespective of the restrictions associated with such restricted shares) shall
be three times (3x) Employee&#146;s annual base salary as set forth in Section&nbsp;2 above, to be rounded
down to the nearer whole share amount. The Parties further agree that the awarding of such
restricted shares shall be made pursuant to the terms of a Restricted Stock Award Agreement to be

First Charter shall pay Employee an amount equal to the cash value of Employee&#146;s restricted shares

as if such shares had vested on a pro-rata basis through the effective date of such event
(calculated using as the numerator the number of days from the beginning of the Restriction Period
to the effective date of the Employee&#146;s Termination of Service, and as the denominator the number
of days from the beginning of the Restriction Period to the last day of the Restriction Period).

are necessary in order to comply with or become exempt from the requirements of section 409A. The
Parties further acknowledge that if Employee is determined to be a &#147;specified employee&#148; as such
term is defined in section 409A of the Internal Revenue Code upon the termination or end of
Employee&#146;s employment with the Bank, that certain payments to Employee under this Agreement may be
required to be postponed to comply with section 409A. Thus, the Parties agree that, in such event,
any payments that are so postponed will be paid to Employee on the first day of the calendar month
following the end of the required postponement period. Employee understands and agrees that he is
responsible for any federal or state tax liability, penalties, excise taxes, interest, tax payments
