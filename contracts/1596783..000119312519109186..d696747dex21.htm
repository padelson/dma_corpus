the right to receive any cash or other consideration as a result of the Merger
or otherwise, other than the consideration payable in respect thereof under
this Agreement).

(c) Each Warrant that is outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time
shall, immediately prior to the Effective Time, automatically be settled,
cancelled, extinguished and converted into and represent the right to receive
an amount in cash equal to the sum of (A) a portion of the Net Merger
Consideration, _plus_ (B) subject to _Section 1.12_, a portion of any amount
released from the Escrow Funds or otherwise payable to the Company
Securityholders pursuant to  _Section 1.12(d)_, _plus_ (C) __ subject to
_Section 1.8(d)_, a portion of any amount released from the Expense Holdback,
if any, if and when released to the Company Securityholders in accordance with
this Agreement, in each case payable in respect of such Warrant as set forth
on the Consideration Allocation Schedule (and, for the avoidance of doubt,
upon such automatic settlement, cancellation, extinguishment and conversion,
such Warrant shall no longer represent the right to be settled into Company
Shares or any other equity interests of the Company, Buyer, the Surviving
Company or any other Person or the right to receive any cash or other
consideration as a result of the Merger or otherwise, other than the
consideration payable in respect thereof under this Agreement).

(d) The Company shall, in accordance with the terms of the applicable Company
Equity Plan and applicable Law, take all actions necessary to (i) cause all
unvested Options issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective
Time and held by any Person (or any estate planning vehicle established by or
for the benefit of such Person or his or her family members) that is and has
been continuously employed by the Company for a period of no less than ten
(10) months prior to the Closing Date to become fully vested on or before the
Closing Date, but prior to the Effective Time, (ii) cause no less than forty
percent (40%) of the unvested Options issued and outstanding immediately prior
to the Effective Time and held by any Person (or any estate planning vehicle
established by or for the benefit of such Person or his or her family
members) that is and has been continuously employed by the Company for a
period of less than ten (10) months prior to the Closing Date to become fully
vested on or before the Closing Date, but prior to the Effective Time, (iii)
effectuate the settlement, cancellation, extinguishment and conversion of all
outstanding Options and Restricted Shares as of immediately prior to the
Effective Time and (iv) cause the termination of each Company Equity Plan,
effective as of the Effective Time. For purposes of clarity, any unvested
Options that are issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective
Time that do not vest pursuant to clauses (i) or (ii) of the
foregoing sentence or are otherwise vested in accordance with their terms
will be immediately cancelled for no consideration immediately prior to the
Effective Time.

 

(e) Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to the contrary, each
Company Share issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time
held by a Company Stockholder who (i) has not voted in favor of adoption of
this Agreement or consented thereto in writing or otherwise waived such
Company Stockholders rights to appraisal under applicable Law and (ii) has
properly exercised appraisal rights with respect to such Company Share in
accordance with Section 262 of the DGCL (such Company Stockholder, a "
_Dissenting_ _Stockholder_ ", and each such Company Share being referred to
as a " _Dissenting Share_ " until such time as such Dissenting Stockholder
fails to perfect or otherwise loses such Dissenting Stockholders appraisal
rights under the DGCL with respect to such Dissenting Share) shall not be
converted into a right to receive a portion of the Merger Consideration, but
instead shall, effective as of the Effective Time, no longer be outstanding
and shall automatically be canceled and extinguished and shall cease to exist,
and except as otherwise provided by Law, the holder of such Dissenting Share
shall cease to have any rights with respect thereto other than the rights
granted pursuant to the DGCL; _provided_ , _however_ , that if, after the
Effective Time, such Dissenting Stockholder fails to perfect, withdraws or
loses such Dissenting Stockholders right to appraisal pursuant to Section 262
of the DGCL or if a court of competent jurisdiction shall determine that such
Dissenting Stockholder is not entitled to the relief provided by Section 262
of the DGCL, such Dissenting Share shall be treated as if it had been
converted as of the Effective Time into the right to receive the portion of
the Merger Consideration, if any, to which such Dissenting Stockholder is
entitled pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 1.6(a)_ without interest thereon. The
Company shall provide Buyer prompt written notice of any demand received by
the Company for appraisal of any Company Share and copies of all documents or
correspondence relating thereto, and Buyer shall have the opportunity and
right to direct all negotiations and proceedings with respect to such demands.
Except with the prior written consent of Buyer, the Company shall not make
any payment with respect to, or settle or offer to settle, any such demands.

1.7 _Letter of Transmittal_.

 

(a) As promptly as practicable following the date of this Agreement, the
Company shall deliver to each Company Stockholder a letter of transmittal
substantially in the form attached hereto as _Exhibit B_ (the " _Letter of
Transmittal_ "). Upon delivery of a Letter of Transmittal to the Company or
the Paying Agent, duly completed and validly executed by the applicable
Company Securityholder in accordance with the instructions thereto, together
with such other documents as may be required pursuant to such instructions
(including any stock certificate evidencing any Company Share held by such
Company Securityholder, to the extent such Company Share is certificated, or,
in each case, a duly executed affidavit of lost certificate), such holder of
Company Shares shall be entitled to receive, by the means indicated in such
Letter of Transmittal, promptly after the Effective Time (or within two (2)
Business Days after delivery of the completed Letter of Transmittal in

Closing Date), such holders applicable portion of the consideration payable
in accordance with _Section 1.6(a)_. Upon receipt by the Company or the

Buyer may cause the Paying Agent to pay over to the Surviving Company any
portion of the Net Merger Consideration (including any earnings thereon) that
had been delivered to the Paying Agent and that has not been disbursed to
Company Stockholders as of such first anniversary (other than any amounts then
subject to dispute). After the Paying Agent makes such payments to the
Surviving Company, any Company Stockholder that has not theretofore delivered
a Letter of Transmittal in the applicable form shall, following such date,
look only to the Surviving Company for payment of any consideration to which
such Company Stockholder is entitled pursuant to this Agreement, except with
respect to any funds expressly required to be distributed by the
Securityholder Representative to the Company Securityholders pursuant to
_Section_ __ _ 1.8_ and in connection with the Purchase Price Adjustment
pursuant to  _Section_ __ _ 1.12_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
in the foregoing, to the extent permitted by applicable Law, none of Buyer,
Merger Sub, the Company or the Surviving Company shall be liable to any Person
in respect of any portion of the Merger Consideration properly delivered to a
public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or
similar Law.

 

1.8 _Escrow Funds; Securityholder Representative; Expense Holdback_.

 

(a) On the Closing Date, Buyer shall deposit the Escrow Amount with the Escrow

designated in writing by the Escrow Agent. The Escrow Funds shall be used
exclusively for the purpose of paying any Purchase Price Adjustment pursuant
to _Section 1.12(c)_ and shall be held by the Escrow Agent in accordance
with the terms of the Escrow Agreement and this Agreement. The Escrow Funds
shall be held in trust and shall not be subject to any Lien, attachment,
trustee process or any other judicial process of any creditor of any Party,

immediately prior to the Effective Time), as applicable, promptly following
the final determination of the Purchase Price Adjustment in accordance with
_Section 1.12_ and the joint written instructions delivered to the Escrow
Agent, but no later than three (3) __ Business Days following receipt of such
joint written instructions. Buyer shall bear the fees and expenses of the
Escrow Agent.

 

(b) Buyer and the Securityholder Representative shall treat any disbursement
of the Escrow Funds to or as directed by the Securityholder Representative

Securityholders) as (i) additional purchase price for U.S. federal income Tax
purposes, except to the extent treated as compensation for U.S. federal
income Tax purposes, and (ii) composed of an interest element and a principal
element, to the extent required by, and determined and reported consistent
with, Section 483 of the Code and the Treasury Regulations thereunder,
except to the extent treated as compensation for U.S. federal income Tax

(c) This Agreement, when duly executed and delivered by the Parties,

Agreement or the Paying Agent Agreement to the Company Securityholders, (iii)
take any and all additional action as is contemplated to be taken by or on
behalf of the Company Securityholders by the terms of this Agreement, the
Escrow Agreement or the Paying Agent Agreement, (iv) administer the defense
or settlement of any dispute regarding the Purchase Price Adjustment pursuant

the Company Securityholders under this Agreement, the Escrow Agreement or the
Paying Agent Agreement, (v) amend, alter or waive any provision of this
Agreement, the Escrow Agreement or the Paying Agent Agreement for and on
behalf of the Company Securityholders and (vi) determine the allocation among
the Company Securityholders of any amount payable to the Company
Securityholders under this Agreement, the Escrow Agreement and the Paying
Agent Agreement, including by updating the Consideration Allocation Schedule

costs, damages or expenses arising out of or resulting from the fraud or
willful misconduct of the Securityholder Representative. Buyer shall be

actions taken or omitted to be taken by the Securityholder Representative
pursuant to this Agreement, all of which actions or omissions will be legally
binding upon the Company Securityholders.

 

(d) An amount equal to $500,000 (the " _Expense Holdback_ ") will be delivered
by Buyer to the Securityholder Representative and retained and disbursed by
the Securityholder Representative pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 1.8(d)_.
The Securityholder Representative shall hold the Expense Holdback as an
administrative convenience for the benefit only of the Securityholder
Representative and the Company Securityholders, and Buyer shall not have any
right, title or interest in the Expense Holdback. The Securityholder
Representative shall use the Expense Holdback solely to pay, after the
Closing Date (on behalf and on account of the Company Securityholders) any
cost or expense relating to the transactions contemplated hereby that are the
responsibility of the Company Securityholders hereunder. Upon the
Securityholder Representatives determination, in its sole discretion, that
no further cost or expense shall be incurred by the Company Securityholders
hereunder, the Securityholder Representative shall disburse any remaining
amount of the Expense Holdback to the Company Securityholders in accordance

Time.

1.10 _Directors and Officers_. The directors and officers of the Surviving

1.12 _Purchase Price Adjustment_.

 

(a) _Pre-Closing Estimates_. At least three (3) Business Days prior to the
Closing Date, the Company shall prepare and deliver to Buyer a statement (the

_Estimated Closing Net Working Capital Amount_ "), (ii) the Closing
Indebtedness (the " _Estimated Closing Indebtedness_ "), (iii) the Closing
Cash (the " _Estimated Closing Cash_ ") and (iv) __ the Closing Transaction
Expenses (the " _Estimated Closing Transaction Expenses_ "). In calculating
any item on the Estimated Closing Statement (other than the Estimated Closing
Transaction Expenses), such calculations shall not take into account (x) __
the effect of the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement or the financing thereof or (y) any purchase price accounting or
other similar adjustment resulting from the consummation of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement. Solely with respect to the calculation of the
Estimated Closing Net Working Capital Amount, in the event of any conflict
among Schedule 1.12, GAAP or the Accounting Principles, the following shall
control: (1) first,  _Schedule_ __ _ 1.12_ (provided that the components
thereof shall in all cases be calculated in accordance with GAAP as applied in
accordance with the Accounting Principles) and (2) second, GAAP as applied in
accordance with the Accounting Principles (to the extent the Accounting
Principles are in accordance with GAAP).

(b) _Post-Closing Settlement_. Not later than ninety (90) days after the
Closing Date, Buyer shall prepare and deliver to the Securityholder
Representative a statement (the " _Closing Statement_ ") setting forth Buyers
good faith calculations of (i) the Net Working Capital Amount of the Company
as of the Determination Time (the " _Closing Net Working Capital Amount_ "),
(ii) the Indebtedness of the Company outstanding as of the Effective Time
(the " _Closing Indebtedness_ "), (iii) the Cash and Cash Equivalents as of
the Determination Time (the " _Closing Cash_ "), (iv) the Company Transaction
Expenses as of the Effective Time (the " _Closing Transaction Expenses_ ")
and (v) the calculation of the Purchase Price Adjustment based on such
amounts. In calculating any items on the Closing Statement (other than the
Closing Transaction Expenses), such calculations shall not take into
account (x) the effect of the consummation of the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement or the financing thereof, (y) any purchase price accounting
or other similar adjustment resulting from the consummation of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement or (z) any of the plans,
transactions, or changes that Buyer (or the Company or the Business) does or
intends to initiate or make or cause to be initiated or made at or after the
consummation of the Closing with respect to the Business. Solely with respect
to the calculation of the Closing Net Working Capital Amount, in the event of
any conflict among _Schedule_ __ _ 1.12_, GAAP or the Accounting Principles,
the following shall control: (1) first,  _Schedule_ __ _ 1.12_ (provided
that the components thereof shall in all cases be calculated in accordance
with GAAP as applied in accordance with the Accounting Principles) and (2)
second, GAAP as applied in accordance with the Accounting Principles (to the
extent the Accounting Principles are in accordance with GAAP). Buyer agrees
that the purpose of preparing the Closing Statement and determining the
Closing Net Working Capital Amount, the Closing Indebtedness, the Closing
Cash and the Closing Transaction Expenses is to measure any deviation in the
calculations of the Closing

 



10

    

 Net Working Capital Amount, the Closing Indebtedness, the Closing Cash and
the Closing Transaction Expenses, as compared to the Estimated Closing Net
Working Capital Amount, the Estimated Closing Indebtedness, the Estimated
Closing Cash and the Estimated Closing Transaction Expenses, respectively.
Such calculations are not intended to, and shall not (i) introduce different
components, judgments, accounting methods, policies, principles, practices,
procedures, classifications or estimation methodologies for the purpose of
preparing the Closing Statement or determining the Closing Net Working Capital
Amount, the Closing Indebtedness, the Closing Cash and the
Closing Transaction Expenses, from the judgments, accounting methods,
policies, principles, practices, procedures, classifications or estimation
methodologies used in preparing the Estimated Closing Statement or determining
the Estimated Closing Net Working Capital Amount, the Estimated Closing
Indebtedness, the Estimated Closing Cash and the Estimated Closing Transaction
Expenses or (ii) take into account any event, condition or development first
occurring after Closing with respect to any such calculation, component,
judgment, accounting method, policy, principle, practice, procedure,
classification or estimation methodology. Following Buyers delivery of the
Closing Statement and upon the written request of the
Securityholder Representative during the thirty (30) day review period
referenced in the immediately following sentence, Buyer shall, and shall cause
the Company to, provide the Securityholder Representative and its
representatives with reasonable access to the books, records (including work
papers, schedules, memoranda and other documents) and supporting data prepared
or generated in connection with the preparation of the Closing Statement. The
Securityholder Representative shall have thirty (30) days after receipt of
the Closing Statement to notify Buyer in writing that the Securityholder
Representative (x) agrees with the Closing Statement and considers the Closing
Statement as delivered by Buyer to be final, or (y) disputes any calculation
in the Closing Statement (including a reasonable description of the nature and
basis of each such dispute), and, if no such notice is given within such time
period, the Closing Statement shall conclusively be deemed final. If the
Securityholder Representative disputes any of the calculations in the Closing
Statement and delivers written notice of such disputed calculations to Buyer
within the thirty (30) day period referenced in the immediately
preceding sentence, Buyer and the Securityholder Representative may negotiate
in good faith to reconcile such disputes and reach agreement on a final
Closing Statement. In the event Buyer and the Securityholder Representative
are unable to reach an agreement on a final Closing Statement within thirty
(30) days following the Securityholder Representatives delivery of the
dispute notice, then either Buyer or the Securityholder Representative may
submit in writing the remaining issues in dispute to the Independent
Accountant (with a copy to the Securityholder Representative or Buyer,
respectively), and the Independent Accountant shall resolve such dispute
within thirty (30) days following its selection. Buyer and the
Securityholder Representative shall cooperate with the Independent
Accountant, including providing the Independent Accountant with work papers
and back-up materials used in preparation and review of their
respective calculations of the Closing Statement. No Party shall be permitted
to communicate with the Independent Accountant other than as expressly set
forth herein, and no _ex parte_ communication with the Independent Accountant
shall be permitted in any event. The Independent Accountant shall only have
authority to make determinations in respect of those specific items for which
an objection has been raised in the dispute notice, and all determinations
shall be based solely on the written presentations of Buyer, the
Securityholder Representative and their respective representatives, and not by
independent review. In resolving any disputed item, the Independent
Accountant, acting as expert and not as arbitrator: (x) shall be bound by the
provisions of this _Section_ __ _ 1.12(b)_ and the applicable definitions

 



11

    

 set forth herein (which, solely with respect to the calculation of the
Estimated Closing Net Working Capital Amount and the Closing Net Working
Capital Amount, shall be calculated in the following order of priority: (1)
first, _Schedule_ __ _ 1.12_ (provided that the components thereof shall in
all cases be calculated in accordance with GAAP as applied in accordance with
the Accounting Principles) and (2) second, GAAP as applied in accordance with
the Accounting Principles (to the extent the Accounting Principles are in
accordance with GAAP)), and (y) shall not assign a value to any item greater
than the greatest value for such item claimed by either Party or less than
the smallest value for such item claimed by either Party. The determination of
the Closing Statement by the Independent Accountant shall be final and binding
upon the Parties, absent manifest error or fraud. The fees, expenses and
costs of the Independent Accountant shall be allocated between the Parties
based upon the percentage which the portion of the contested amount not
awarded to each Party bears to the total contested amount.

 

(c) _Purchase Price Adjustment_. Subject to _Section_ __ _ 1.12(d)_:

 

(i) To the extent that the Closing Net Working Capital Amount, as finally
determined in accordance with  _Section 1.12(b)_, is (x) __ less than the
Estimated Closing Net Working Capital Amount, then Buyer shall be entitled to
receive such deficiency in accordance with _Section 1.12(d)_, or (y) __
greater than the Estimated Closing Net Working Capital Amount, then the
Company Securityholders shall be entitled to receive such excess in accordance
with _Section_ __ _ 1.12(d)_ _._

 

(ii) To the extent that the Closing Indebtedness, as finally determined in
accordance with  _Section_ __ _ 1.12(b)_, is (x) greater than the Estimated

accordance with _Section_ __ _ 1.12(d)_, or (y) less than the Estimated
Closing Indebtedness, then the Company Securityholders shall be entitled to
receive such deficiency in accordance with _Section_ __ _ 1.12(d)_.

 

(iii) To the extent that the Closing Cash, as finally determined in accordance
with _Section_ __ _ 1.12(b)_, is (x) less than the Estimated Closing Cash,

the Company Securityholders shall be entitled to receive such excess in
accordance with _Section_ __ _ 1.12(d)_.

 

(iv) To the extent that the Closing Transaction Expenses, as finally
determined in accordance with  _Section_ __ _ 1.12(b)_, are (x) greater than
the Estimated Closing Transaction Expenses, then Buyer shall be entitled to
receive such excess in accordance with _Section_ __ _ 1.12(d)_, or (y) less
than the Estimated Closing Transaction Expenses, then the Company
Securityholders shall be entitled to receive such deficiency in accordance
with _Section_ __ _ 1.12(d)_.

 

(d) Without duplication, all amounts owed pursuant to Section __ 1.12(c)
above shall be aggregated, and the net amount (if any) owed by Buyer to the
Company Securityholders, on the one hand, or the Company Securityholders to
Buyer (solely from the Escrow Funds), on the other hand, shall be treated as
an increase to the Merger Consideration (to the extent payable to the Company
Securityholders) or a decrease to Merger Consideration (to the extent payable
to Buyer) referred to as the "Purchase Price Adjustment"; _provided, however_
, that no amount shall be due pursuant to this _Section 1.12(d)_ unless the
Purchase Price Adjustment is equal to or greater than ten percent (10%) of the
absolute value of the Target Working Capital Amount.

 



12

    

(i) If an adjustment is due pursuant to this _Section 1.12(d)_ and
the Purchase Price Adjustment results in a decrease to the Merger
Consideration, Buyer and the Securityholder Representative shall, within five
(5) Business Days following the final determination of the Purchase Price
Adjustment, deliver joint written instructions to the Escrow Agent to pay, by
wire transfer of immediately available funds, to (i) __ Buyer, the lesser of

Shares, payment to the Company for distribution to the holders thereof as of
immediately prior to the Effective Time), the Escrow Funds, payable in
accordance with _Section 1.6_.

 

(iii) If an adjustment is due pursuant to this _Section 1.12(d)_ and the

pursuant to the outstanding amount of Repaid Debt and the Company Transaction
Expenses, and (ii) all of the out-of-pocket costs of Buyer arising from the
consummation of the transactions and any fees incurred in connection with the
Financing (the foregoing amounts, collectively, the " _Required Closing
Amount_ "). Buyer has provided to the Company a true, complete and accurate
copy of the fully executed (i) debt commitment letter, together with
the related fee letter (subject to customary redactions of the fee amounts
and other economic terms therein ( _provided_ that such redactions do not
include, for the avoidance of doubt, any terms that would adversely affect the
conditionality or availability of the Debt Financing, and none of the
redacted provisions would allow the Debt Financing Sources to reduce the
amount of funding to be provided under the Debt Commitment Letter (or the
definitive documentation entered into pursuant thereto) or change the
conditions on which such funding is available if in any such case such change
would reasonably be expected to prevent, materially delay or impede the
consummation of the Debt Financing thereunder)), dated as of the date hereof,
between the lenders party thereto (including any lender who becomes party
thereto by joinder in accordance with the terms of such debt commitment
letter, collectively, the " _Debt Financing_ _Sources_ ") and Buyer
(such debt commitment letter and fee letter, together with all exhibits,
schedules, annexes and term sheets attached thereto, and, to the extent
otherwise in accordance with the terms hereof, supplements and amendments
thereto, the " _Debt Commitment Letter_ "), pursuant to which the Debt
Financing Sources party thereto have committed to lend the amounts set forth
therein on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth therein for the
purpose of funding the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (the "
_Debt Financing_ ") and (ii) equity commitment and investment agreement, dated
as of the date hereof, between Green Equity Investors VII, L.P., a Delaware
limited partnership and Green Equity Investors Side VII, L.P., a Delaware
limited partnership (the " _Equity Financing Sources_ "), and Parent Guarantor
(together with all exhibits, schedules, annexes and, to the extent otherwise
in accordance with the terms hereof, supplements and amendments thereto, the
" _Equity Commitment Arrangements_ " and, together with the Debt Commitment
Letter, the " _Commitment Arrangements_ "), pursuant to which the Equity
Financing Sources agreed to invest the amounts set forth therein on the terms
and

 



34

    

 subject to the conditions set forth therein for the purpose of funding the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement (the " _Equity Financing_ " and,
together with the Debt Financing, the " _Financing_ "). The Commitment
Arrangements have not been amended, supplemented or modified in any manner in
contravention of this Agreement, and as of the date hereof the commitments
contained in the Commitment Arrangements have not been withdrawn or rescinded
in any respect. As of the date hereof, the Commitment Arrangements are in full
force and effect and each constitutes the legal, valid and binding obligation
of Buyer and, in the case of the Equity Commitment Arrangements, Parent
Guarantor and, to Buyers knowledge, each of the other parties thereto,
enforceable against each such Person in accordance with its terms, except to
the extent that enforceability thereof may be limited by bankruptcy,
insolvency, reorganization, fraudulent conveyance, moratorium and other
similar Laws affecting the enforcement of creditors rights generally and by
general principles of equity. Other than the Commitment Arrangements, there
are no other agreements, side letters or arrangements relating to the amount,
conditionality, availability or termination of the Financing. There is no
condition precedent or other contingency related to the funding of the full
amount of the Financing, other than as expressly set forth in the Commitment
Arrangements. Buyer has fully paid any and all commitment fees or other fees
required by the Debt Commitment Letter to be paid by it on or prior to the
date hereof. Assuming the satisfaction of the conditions precedent to Buyers
obligations hereunder, Buyer is not aware of any fact or occurrence that, with
or without notice, lapse of time or both, would constitute a default or breach
under any Commitment Arrangement and has no reason to believe that it will
not be able to satisfy any term or condition that is required to be satisfied
as a condition to the availability or funding of the full amount of the
Financing, or that the Financing will not be made available to Buyer on
the Closing Date. Each of Buyer and Merger Sub affirms that it is not a
condition to the Closing that Buyer obtain the Financing or any other
financing for the transactions contemplated hereby.

Representatives not to contact, any customer or supplier of the Company

_further,_ that, for the avoidance of doubt, nothing contained in this

respective Representatives from contacting any Person that is or may be a
customer or supplier of the Company regarding any matter unrelated to the
Company, the Business or the transactions contemplated hereby.

(c) Without limiting the generality of anything contained in this _Section_

a reasonable opportunity to review and comment upon the Company Information

prior to the Company Information Statement or such other materials or notices
being delivered to the Company Stockholders.

4.8 _Retention of and Access to Records_. For a period of five (5) years
after the Closing Date (or such longer period as may be required by applicable
Law), Buyer shall, and shall cause its Affiliates to (a) retain the books and
records of the Company relating to periods prior to the Closing in accordance
with Buyers document retention policies as in effect from time to time and
(b) provide the Securityholder Representative and its Representatives
reasonable access thereto, during normal business hours and on at least five
(5) Business Days prior written notice, to the extent reasonably necessary
for the Securityholder Representative to respond to any proceeding or inquiry
by a Governmental Entity or as otherwise required by Law.

 

4.9 _Employment and Benefits Matters_.

 

(a) For the period commencing at the Effective Time and ending twelve (12)
months after the Effective Time, Buyer shall cause the Surviving Company to
maintain (i) base salary and annual incentive opportunities (other than
equity-based incentives), for the employees of the Company who remain employed
after the Effective Time (the " _Company Employees_ "), at levels that are
substantially comparable in the aggregate to those in effect for the Company
Employees immediately prior to the Effective Time, and (ii) health and welfare
benefits, retirement benefits and other employee benefits (other than equity-
based incentives) that are substantially comparable in the aggregate to those
provided to similarly situated employees of Buyer and its Affiliates;
_provided_ , that to the extent that a Company Employee continues to
participate in an Employee Plan following the Effective Time, such continued
participation on terms substantially comparable to those offered immediately
prior to the Effective Time will be deemed to satisfy the requirements of
clause (ii) of this _Section_ __ _ 4.9(a)_. Buyer will treat, and cause the
applicable benefit plans to treat, the service of the Company Employees with
the Company attributable to any period before the Effective Time as
service rendered to Buyer or any of its Subsidiaries for purposes of
eligibility and vesting under Buyers vacation program, health or welfare
plan(s) maintained by Buyer and Buyers defined contribution plans, except, in
each case, where credit would result in duplication of benefits. Without
limiting the foregoing, to the extent that any Company Employee participates
in any health or other group welfare benefit plan of Buyer following the
Effective Time, Buyer shall use reasonable best efforts to cause (A) any pre-
existing condition limitation, eligibility waiting period or required physical
examination under any health or similar welfare plan of Buyer to be waived
with respect to the Company Employees and their eligible dependents, to the
extent waived under the corresponding plan in which the Company Employee
participated immediately prior to the Effective Time, and (B) any deductible
paid by the Company Employee under any of the Companys health plans in the
plan year in which the Effective Time occurs to be credited towards
deductibles under the health plans of Buyer or any of its Subsidiaries.

 

(b) To the extent requested by Buyer in writing no later than fifteen (15)
days prior to the anticipated Closing Date, the Company shall, prior to the
Closing Date, take such corporate action as is necessary to cause the Paragon
Bioservices, Inc. 401(k) Plan (the " _Company 401(k) Plan_ ") to be terminated
effective immediately prior to the Closing, subject to the consummation of
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and, in connection therewith,
Buyer or its Affiliates, as applicable, shall take all steps reasonably
necessary to permit each Company Employee who was participating in
the Company 401(k) Plan immediately prior to the Closing to begin
participating in a 401(k) plan maintained by Buyer or one of its Affiliates,
subject to the eligibility requirements applicable to similarly situated
employees of Buyer and its Affiliates as of the Closing.

 



44

    

(c) Nothing in this Agreement shall confer upon any Company Employee
any right to continue in the employ or service of Buyer or any of its
Affiliates, or shall interfere with or restrict in any way the rights of
Buyer, which rights are hereby expressly reserved, to discharge or terminate
the services of any Company Employee at any time for any reason whatsoever,
with or without cause. Notwithstanding any provision in this Agreement to the
contrary, nothing in this _Section_ __ _ 4.9_ shall (i) be deemed or
construed to be an amendment or other modification of any Employee Plan or
Buyer employee benefit plan, or (ii) create any third-party right in any
current or former employee, director or other service provider of Buyer, the
Company or any of their respective Affiliates (or any beneficiary or
dependent thereof).

(d) _Section_ __ _ 280G Waiver and Approval Process_.

 

(i) Buyer and the Company acknowledge that certain amounts which may be
received by any Person in connection with the Merger may be deemed to
constitute a "parachute payment" (within the meaning of Section 280G). The
Company shall use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain, prior to the
solicitation of the requisite Company Stockholders (as described in _Section_
__ _ 4.9(d)(ii)_), a Section 280G Waiver from each Disqualified Individual,
as determined immediately prior to the initiation of the solicitation of the
requisite Company Stockholder approval described in _Section_ __ _
4.9(d)(ii)_, and who might otherwise receive or have the right or entitlement
to receive a "parachute payment" under Section 280G in connection with the
Merger, unless the requisite Company Stockholder approval of such "parachute
payments" is obtained pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 4.9(d)(ii)_.

 

(ii) Subject to the last sentence of this _Section_ __ _ 4.9(d)(ii)_, as soon
as practicable following the receipt by the Company of the Section 280G
Waivers for the applicable individuals described in _Section_ __ _
4.9(d)(i)_, the Company shall submit to the applicable Company Stockholders
for approval in accordance with Section 280G(b)(5)(B) of the Code any
payments and benefits that are subject to a Section 280G Waiver, such that
such payments and benefits shall not be deemed to be "parachute payments"
under Section 280G. Prior to the Closing, the Company shall deliver to Buyer,
with respect to any payments or benefits that are subject to a Section 280G
Waiver: (A) evidence that a Company Stockholder vote was solicited in
conformance with Section 280G, and the requisite Company Stockholder approval
was obtained with respect to any payments and/or benefits that were subject to
the Company Stockholder vote (the " _Section_ __ _ 280G Approval_"), or (B)
notice that the Section 280G Approval was not obtained and as a consequence,
pursuant to the Section 280G Waiver, such "parachute payments" shall not be
made or provided. The Company shall deliver to Buyer at least two (2) Business
Days prior to submission to the Company Stockholders copies of all documents
being submitted by the Company to the Company Stockholders pursuant to this
_Section_ __ _ 4.9(d)(ii)_, as well as the underlying calculation materials,
and Buyer shall provide comments as soon as reasonably practicable after
receipt of such materials that the Company shall reasonably consider prior to
distributing the applicable documents to the Company Stockholders; _provided_
that, in any event, the Companys inadvertent failure to include in the
materials for Section 280G

 



45

    

 Approval described herein any Contract, agreement, or plan that is entered
into by Buyer, the Surviving Company or any of their respective Affiliates and
a Disqualified Individual in connection with the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement before the Closing Date and which is known to the Company will
not result in a breach of the covenants set forth in this _Section_ __ _
4.9(d)_.

 

4.10 _No Solicitation_. Between the date hereof and the Closing Date, neither
the Company nor any of its Representatives shall directly or indirectly
(including by way of providing information regarding the Company or the
Business to any Person or providing access to any Person) (a) solicit any
offer, proposal or inquiry (oral, written or electronic), or encourage or
facilitate the solicitation of any offer, proposal or inquiry (oral, written
or electronic) relating to any potential Competing Transaction; (b)
participate in, continue or engage in any discussion or negotiation relating
to, furnish any information concerning the Company or the Business or any
property of the Company with respect to, afford access to any of its or their
properties or business records in connection with, or facilitate in any other
manner any effort or attempt by any Person other than Buyer to make or seek
any potential Competing Transaction; or (c) enter into any agreement,
arrangement or understanding (oral, written or electronic) relating to any
potential Competing Transaction. The Company shall promptly notify Buyer if
any such offer or inquiry is received by, any such information is requested
from or any such negotiation or discussion is sought to be initiated or
continued with the Company or any of their respective
Representatives, including the nature and terms of any of the foregoing and
any modification to the nature or terms relating to any potential Competing
Transaction. The Company shall, and shall cause its Affiliates to, advise
their applicable officers, directors, managers, equityholders and executive
employees of the existence of the foregoing covenants, and the Company shall,
and shall cause its Affiliates to respond to any inquiry received by their
respective Representatives regarding any Competing Transaction by stating
that the Company and its Affiliates are subject to the foregoing covenants.

4.11 _Financial Statement Preparation_. The Company shall use its reasonable
best efforts prior to Closing to prepare, or assist Buyer in causing to be
prepared, as promptly as practicable, any financial statements that Buyer is
required to file with the SEC pursuant to Form 8-K and Rule 3-05 under the
Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the " _Exchange Act_ ") or that
are necessary in order for Buyer to comply with Article 11 of Regulation S-X
under the Exchange Act (which, for the avoidance of doubt, shall include (a)
the audited balance sheets and the related audited statements of operations,

Statements_ " and, together with the 2017 Audited Financial Statements, the "
_Audited Financial Statements_ "), in each case, audited in accordance the
American Institute of Certified Public Accountants (" _AICPA_ ") standards by

expected to be able to deliver such audited financial statements and the
"comfort letters" described below prior to the date that is seventy six (76)

provide customary "comfort letters" (including customary "negative

for the comparable prior-year period), in 

 



46

    

 each case, reviewed in accordance with AICPA Statement of Auditing Standards

Statements as may be required by applicable SEC regulations and Form 8-K.
Buyer and Merger Sub acknowledge and agree that delivering or obtaining the
financial statements and other documents and information contemplated by this
_Section_ __ _ 4.11_ is not a condition to Closing and shall in no event
delay the consummation of the Closing.

4.12 _Cooperation; Financial Information_.

 

(a) From the date hereof until the earlier of the Closing and termination of
this Agreement as provided herein, Buyer (and, with respect to the Equity
Financing, Parent Guarantor) shall use reasonable best efforts to, and use
reasonable best efforts to cause its Representatives to use reasonable best
efforts to, take, or cause to be taken, all actions and to do, or cause to be
done, all things necessary or advisable to arrange and consummate the
Financing, including with respect to the (i) Debt Financing: by maintaining
the Debt Commitment Letter in full force and effect, and obtaining the
financing contemplated thereby as promptly as reasonably practicable, and in
any event by the Closing Date, on the terms and conditions set forth in the
Debt Commitment Letter (including the "market flex" provisions in the fee
letter), including complying with Buyers obligations under the Debt
Commitment Letter and using reasonable best efforts to, and using reasonable
best efforts to cause its Representatives to use reasonable best efforts to,
(A) __ as promptly as practicable, negotiate, execute, and deliver
definitive agreements with respect to the Financing contemplated by the Debt
Commitment Letter on the terms and conditions contemplated thereby (including
the "market flex" provisions in the fee letter), (B) satisfy (or seek the
waiver of), on a timely basis, all conditions to funding that are applicable
to Buyer in the Debt Commitment Letter, (C) __ require the Debt Financing
Sources to abide by their obligations under the Debt Commitment Letter and
(D) __ subject to the satisfaction of the conditions set forth in the Debt
Commitment Letter and _Article 5_ , consummate the Debt Financing at or prior
to the Closing Date, and (ii) __ Equity Financing: by maintaining the Equity
Commitment Arrangements in full force and effect, and obtaining the financing
contemplated thereby as promptly as reasonably

 



47

    

 practicable, and in any event by the Closing Date, on the terms and
conditions set forth in the Equity Commitment Arrangements, including
complying with Parent Guarantors and Buyers obligations under the Equity
Commitment Arrangements and using reasonable best efforts to, and using
reasonable best efforts to cause its Representatives to use reasonable best
efforts to, (A) as promptly as practicable, negotiate, execute, and deliver
definitive agreements with respect to the Financing contemplated by the Equity
Commitment Arrangements on the terms and conditions contemplated thereby, (B)
__ satisfy (or seek the waiver of), on a timely basis, all conditions
to funding that are applicable to Parent Guarantor and Buyer in the Equity
Commitment Arrangements, (C) __ require the Equity Financing Sources to abide
by their obligations under the Equity Commitment Arrangements and (D) __
subject to the satisfaction of the conditions set forth in the Equity
Commitment Arrangements and _Article 5_ , consummate the Equity Financing at
or prior to the Closing Date. In furtherance and not in limitation of the
foregoing, in the event that any portion of the Financing becomes unavailable
on the terms and conditions set forth in the Commitment Arrangements or it
becomes reasonably likely that it would become so unavailable, Parent
Guarantor (with respect to the Equity Financing) and Buyer shall as promptly
as practicable (and in any event within two (2) __ Business Days) following
the occurrence of such event, notify the Company thereof in writing and use
reasonable best efforts to, and use reasonable best efforts to cause its
Representatives to use reasonable best efforts to, obtain (x) __ alternative
financing from alternative sources in an amount sufficient to pay the Required
Closing Amount and consummate the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement that does not contain any condition to funding that would be more
onerous than those contained in the Debt Commitment Letter or Equity
Commitment Arrangements, as applicable, on the date of this Agreement or any
term that would reasonably be expected to prevent, materially delay or impede
the consummation of the financing thereunder and that is otherwise on terms no
less favorable, in the aggregate, to Parent Guarantor (with respect to the
Equity Financing) or Buyer than the Debt Commitment Letter or Equity
Commitment Arrangements, as applicable, as of the date of this Agreement (the
" _Alternate Financing_ "), and (y) __ one or more new financing commitment
letters or agreements with respect to such Alternate Financing (each, a "
_New Commitment Arrangement_ "), in each case, which New Commitment
Arrangement(s) will replace the existing applicable Commitment Arrangement in
whole or in part. Parent Guarantor (with respect to the Equity Financing) and
Buyer shall promptly provide the Company with a true, complete and accurate
copy of any New Commitment Arrangement, together with any related exhibit,
schedule, supplement and term sheet, and a true, complete and accurate
copy of any fee letter in connection with any New Commitment Arrangement
replacing all or any part of the Debt Commitment Letter (it being understood
that the fee amounts and other economic terms in such letter will be redacted
in a customary manner;  _provided_ that such redactions do not include, for
the avoidance of doubt, any terms that would adversely affect the
conditionality or availability of the Alternate Financing, and none of the
redacted provisions would allow the financing sources thereof to reduce the
amount of funding to be provided under the New Commitment Arrangement (or the
definitive documentation entered into pursuant thereto) or change the
conditions on which such funding is available if in any such case any such
change would reasonably be expected to prevent, materially delay or impede the
consummation of the financing thereunder). In the event that any New
Commitment Arrangement is obtained, (A) __ any reference in this Agreement to
the "Commitment Arrangements", "Debt Financing", "Debt Commitment Letter",
"Equity Financing", "Equity Commitment Arrangements" or "Financing" shall mean
the Commitment Arrangements, Debt Financing, Debt Commitment Letter, Equity
Financing or Equity Commitment Arrangements, as applicable, to the

 



48

    

 extent not superseded and still in effect at the time in question and such
New Commitment Arrangement (along with any related fee letter), and (B) any
reference in this Agreement to the "Debt Financing", "Equity Financing" or
the "Financing" will mean the Debt Financing, Equity Financing or Financing
contemplated by the applicable Commitment Arrangements as modified pursuant to
the foregoing.

 

(b) Neither Parent Guarantor (with respect to the Equity Financing) nor Buyer
will consent to any amendment, restatement, replacement, supplement,
termination, assignment, modification or waiver of any provision (including
any condition) of, or remedy under, the Commitment Arrangements without the
prior written consent of the Company, to the extent such
amendment, restatement, replacement, supplement, termination, assignment,
modification or waiver (i) reduces the aggregate amount of the Financing below
the Required Closing Amount, (ii) imposes new or additional conditions, or
otherwise expands or adversely modifies any of the conditions, to the
availability or funding of the Financing, (iii) adversely affects the ability
of Parent Guarantor (with respect to the Equity Financing) or Buyer to enforce
its rights against the other parties to the Equity Commitment Arrangements,
or (iv) individually or in the aggregate, would reasonably be expected to (A)
prevent, materially delay or impede the Closing, (B) make the funding of the
Financing or satisfaction of the conditions to obtaining the Financing, in
each case necessary to pay the Required Closing Amount and consummate the
transactions contemplated hereby, less likely in any material respect to occur
at or prior to the Closing, or (C) adversely affect the ability of Buyer in
any material respect to consummate timely the transactions contemplated hereby
(each of the items described in the foregoing clauses (i) through (iv) being
referred to herein as a " _Restricted Modification_ "); _provided, however_ ,
that, so long as not constituting a Restricted Modification, Buyer may (A)
amend the Debt Commitment Letter to add lenders, lead arrangers, bookrunners,
agents, syndication agents, documentation agents, or similar entities who had
not executed the Debt Commitment Letter as of the date hereof in accordance
with the provisions hereof and of the Debt Commitment Letter, (B) amend or
otherwise modify the Debt Commitment Letter to implement any flex provisions
applicable thereto, or (C) otherwise amend, modify or replace, or agree to any
waiver in respect of, the Debt Commitment Letter or the Equity Commitment
Arrangements in connection with an Alternate Financing so long as the
requirements with respect to Alternate Financings set forth in _Section_ __ _
4.12(a)_ are satisfied. Each of Parent Guarantor (with respect to the Equity
Financing) and Buyer shall keep the Company informed on a reasonably current
basis and in reasonable detail with respect to all material activity and
developments concerning the status of its efforts to arrange and consummate
the Financing. Without limiting the foregoing, each of Parent Guarantor
(with respect to the Equity Financing) and Buyer shall promptly (and in any
event within two (2) Business Days after it becomes aware thereof) notify the
Company of (i) the expiration or termination of any Commitment Arrangement or
any definitive agreement related to the Financing, (ii) any material breach
or default (or any event or circumstance that, with or without notice, lapse
of time or both, could reasonably be expected to give rise to any material
breach or default) by any party to the Commitment Arrangements or any
definitive agreement related to the Financing, (iii) receipt of any written
notice or other written communication from any Financing Source party to any
Commitment Arrangement with respect to any: (A) actual default, termination
or repudiation by such Financing Source of any Commitment Arrangement or (B)
material dispute or disagreement between or among any parties to any
Commitment Arrangement or any definitive agreement related to the Financing
(in each case, other than ordinary course negotiations), (iv) if for any
reason Parent Guarantor (with respect to the Equity Financing) or Buyer no
longer believes

 



49

    

 that it will be able to satisfy any term or condition that is required to be
satisfied as a condition to the availability or funding of the full amount of
the Financing, or that the Financing will not be made available to Parent
Guarantor (with respect to the Equity Financing) or Buyer, on the Closing Date
and (v) if for any reason Parent Guarantor (with respect to the Equity
Financing) or Buyer no longer believes Buyer shall have at the Closing
sufficient cash, available lines of credit and other sources of immediately
available funds to pay the Required Closing Amount and consummate all of the
transactions contemplated hereunder on the Closing Date. For the avoidance
of doubt, the execution, delivery and performance of the Equity Commitment
Arrangements by the parties thereto will not relieve Parent Guarantor or Buyer
of any of its obligations under this _Section_ __ _ 4.12_ unless and until
the Equity Financing is consummated in accordance with the Equity Commitment
Arrangements and all proceeds thereof are contributed to Buyer.

 

(c) From the date hereof until the earlier of the Closing and termination of
this Agreement as provided herein, the Company shall, and shall use
reasonable best efforts to cause its Representatives to use reasonable best
efforts to, provide such cooperation and assistance to Buyer, at Buyers sole
cost and expense, in connection with the arrangement of the Debt Financing as
is (x) customary for debt financings of the type contemplated by the Debt
Commitment Letter and (y) reasonably requested by Buyer, including the
following actions:

 

(i) participating, at mutually agreed upon times and subject to customary
confidentiality agreements, in (A) a reasonable number of meetings with the
Debt Financing Sources and prospective providers of the Debt Financing (and
causing the members of senior management of the Company to participate in such
meetings), (B) rating agency presentations in respect of the Debt Financing
and (C) due diligence sessions with the Debt Financing Sources and prospective
providers of the Debt Financing, and cooperating reasonably with the marketing
efforts of Buyer and the Debt Financing Sources in connection with all or any
portion of the Debt Financing;

(ii) using reasonable best efforts to assist Buyer and the Debt Financing
Sources in the preparation of rating agency presentations, bank information
memoranda (including a version thereof that does not contain material non-
public information), lender presentations, and other similar materials for
the Debt Financing, including, to the extent requested by the Debt Financing
Sources, to cause the execution and delivery of reasonable and customary
representation and authorization letters in connection with any bank
information memoranda;

(iii) (A) furnishing to Buyer and the Debt Financing Sources as promptly as
reasonably practical the Company Financial Statements (which Buyer
acknowledges and agrees have been furnished as of the date of this Agreement),
and (B) using reasonable best efforts to furnish to Buyer and the
Debt Financing Sources as promptly as reasonably practical such financial or
pertinent information regarding the Company as may be reasonably available to
the Company and that is (I) reasonably requested by Buyer in connection with
the preparation of a confidential information memorandum customary for the
type of financing contemplated by the Debt Commitment Letter as in effect on
the date hereof, and (II) reasonably necessary in order to consummate the Debt
Financing;

 



50

    

(iv) cooperating reasonably with the Debt Financing Sources customary due
diligence;

(v) using reasonable best efforts to take such actions as are reasonably
requested by Buyer or the Debt Financing Sources to facilitate the
satisfaction of the conditions set forth in the Debt Commitment Letter
(including reasonably facilitating, effective no earlier than the Closing
Date, the taking of collateral of the Company contemplated by the Debt
Commitment Letter) and the taking of corporate actions by the Company with
respect to entering into definitive documentation with respect to the Debt
Financing; _provided_ that any such corporate action shall be contingent
upon, and shall only be effective as of, the Closing;

(vi) executing and delivering, at and effective as of the Closing, such
definitive financing documents and other customary closing documents as may be
reasonably requested by Buyer and are required in connection with the Debt
Financing;

 

(vii) cooperating reasonably in connection with (A) the termination of
existing guarantees of Indebtedness and the release of related Liens, if any,
at and effective as of the Closing and the payoff of the Repaid Debt in
accordance with this Agreement and the payoff letters and lien termination
documentation delivered in accordance herewith, and (B) Buyers efforts to
effect the replacement or backing of any outstanding letter of credit
maintained or provided by the Company at and effective as of the Closing;

 

(viii) at least five (5) Business Days prior to the Closing Date, providing
all documentation and other information regarding the Company required by
regulatory authorities under applicable "know your customer" and anti-money
laundering Laws, including the USA PATRIOT Act and the "Beneficial Ownership
Regulations" (31 CFR §1010.230), including any certification regarding
individual beneficial ownership solely to the extent required by 31 CFR
§1010.230, that has been requested in writing by Buyer at least eight (8)
Business Days prior to the Closing Date in order to satisfy the conditions
set forth in the Debt Commitment Letter (if applicable); and

(ix) facilitate the taking of all corporate or similar actions reasonably
requested by Buyer to permit the consummation of the Debt Financing (it being
understood that all such actions shall be contingent on the occurrence of, and
no such action will be effective until at or after, the Closing Date).

(d) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the requirements of  _Section
4.12(c)_, (i) the Company shall not be required to enter into or approve (or
commit to enter into or approve) any certificate, document, agreement,
instrument, or financing agreement, in each case, that will be effective prior
to the Closing Date (other than reasonable and customary representation and
authorization letters (including with respect to the absence or the presence
of material non-public information) in connection with any bank information
memoranda as contemplated above and subject to customary exclusions), (ii)
the Company and its

 



51

    

 Representatives shall not be required (A) to pay or commit to pay any
commitment or other fee or incur any other Liability (including any guarantee,
indemnity or pledge) in connection with the Financing prior to the Closing or
that would be treated as a Company Transaction Expense, (B) provide any
cooperation that would unreasonably interfere with the ongoing operations of
the Company, (C) take any action that would result in any officer, director
or other Representative of the Company incurring any personal liability with
respect to any matters relating to the Financing or (D) deliver or cause the
delivery of any legal opinions or any certificate as to solvency, and (iii)
nothing herein will require the Company or any of its Representatives to
provide any information or take any action, the disclosure or taking of which
would violate applicable Law, any fiduciary duty, any Contract, or obligation
of confidentiality owing to a third party, or jeopardize the protection of
the attorney-client privilege (it being agreed that the Company shall give
notice to Buyer of the fact that it is withholding such information or
documents on the basis of any such Law, duty, Contract, obligation or
privilege, shall withhold only that portion of such information that is
reasonably necessary to be withheld to not violate any applicable Law, duty,
Contract or obligation and to preserve the attorney-client privilege, and
thereafter the Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause such
information to be provided in a manner that would not reasonably be expected
to violate such Law, duty, Contract or obligation or waive the attorney-
client privilege). The Company and its Representatives shall be given a
reasonable opportunity to review (following reasonable request therefor) and
comment on any documentation and any materials that are to be presented during
any meetings conducted in connection with the Financing, and Buyer shall give
due consideration to all reasonable additions, deletions or changes suggested
thereto by the Company and its Representatives.

contemplated by this _Section_ __ _ 4.12_. Buyer shall indemnify and hold
harmless the Company and its Representatives from and against any and all
liabilities, losses, damages, claims, costs, expenses, interest, awards,
judgments, and penalties incurred or suffered by them in connection with the
Financing; _provided_ that Buyer shall not have any obligation to indemnify
and hold harmless any such party or Person to the extent that any such damages
suffered or incurred result from the Companys or its Representatives willful
misconduct or gross negligence, in each case, as determined in a final, non-
appealable decision of a court of competent jurisdiction.

(f) Buyer and Merger Sub acknowledge and agree that obtaining the Financing
is not a condition to Closing.

(g) The Company hereby consents to the use of its logos in connection with
the Debt Financing; _provided_ that such logos are used solely in a manner
that does not, and would not reasonably be likely to, harm or disparage the
Company or any of its Affiliates or their reputation or goodwill. All non-
public information regarding the Company and its Affiliates provided to any of
Buyer, the Financing Sources or any of their respective Representatives
pursuant to this  _Section_ __ _ 4.12_ shall be kept confidential, except
for disclosure to potential lenders and investors and their respective
Representatives that is reasonably required in connection with the Financing
and is subject to customary confidentiality protections.

 



52

    

4.13 _Affiliate Arrangements_. Except for the Contracts and other Affiliate
Arrangements set forth on _Schedule 4.13_ , on or prior to the Closing, the
Company shall terminate all Affiliate Arrangements in a manner and on such
terms that shall not subject the Company, Buyer or their respective Affiliates
to any ongoing Liability or require the Company or its Affiliates to make any
termination, indemnity or other payment on or after the Closing Date.

Transaction Expense pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 8.5_ or (ii) to the extent any
such Transfer Taxes are not provided for in Company Transaction Expenses, the

such tax returns and other documentation, and each other Party shall, and
shall cause its Affiliates to, cooperate with respect to the preparation and
filing of such tax returns and other documentation.

 

(b) Any compensatory payment under this Agreement, including with respect to
holders of vested Options with respect to such Options, shall be subject to
withholding and Tax reporting, and all such withholding and Tax reporting
shall be effectuated by use of the payroll system of the Company or Surviving
Company, as applicable.

 

4.15 _Representations and Warranties Insurance Policy_. In the event Buyer,
Merger Sub or any of their respective Affiliates elects to obtain a

commissions and other costs and expenses related to such representations and
warranties insurance policy shall be borne solely by Buyer, Merger Sub or such
Affiliate and (b) such representations and warranties insurance policy shall
not provide for any "seller retention" (as such phrase is commonly used in the
representations and warranty policy industry) and shall expressly waive any
claims of subrogation, except in the case of fraud.

made in _Section 2.1_ (Organization and Standing), _Section 2.2_
(Capitalization), _Section 2.3_ (No Subsidiaries), _Section 2.4_ (Authority
to Execute and Perform Agreements) and _Section 2.25_ (Brokers)
(collectively, the " _Fundamental Representations_ ")) shall be true and
correct, without regard to any qualification as to "material", "materiality",
or "Company Material Adverse Effect" (or any correlative term) contained in
such representations and warranties (except for any use of the term "Material
Agreement" and the reference to "Company Material Adverse Effect" in _Section
2.9(b)_), as of the date hereof and the Closing Date, other than
representations and warranties made as of a particular date (in which case
such representations and warranties shall be true and correct as of such
date), in each case, except where the failure of such representations and
warranties to be true and correct, individually or in the aggregate, has not
had a Company Material Adverse Effect, and (ii) __ that is a Fundamental
Representation shall be true and correct in all material respects, as of the
date hereof and the Closing Date, other than (x) __ any Fundamental
Representation made as of a particular date (in which case such
Fundamental Representation shall be true and correct as of such date) and (y)
the first sentence of _Section_ __ _ 2.2_, which shall be true and correct in
all respects as of the date hereof and as of the Closing Date except for any
_de minimis_ inaccuracy.

(b) The Company shall have performed and complied in all material respects
with all covenants and agreements required by this Agreement to be performed

purposes of this _Section_ __ _ 5.1(b)_, a breach by the Company of

relating to the Financing shall not be taken into account in determining
whether the condition set forth in this _Section_ __ _ 5.1(b)_ has been
satisfied unless (i) the Company acts in bad faith in any material respect
with respect to its obligations under _Section_ __ _ 4.11_ or _4.12_ or such
other provision (as applicable), (ii) such breach has not been cured within
five (5) Business Days after the Companys receipt of written notice thereof
from Buyer specifying in reasonable detail the nature of such breach and (iii)
such breach is a substantial cause of the Debt Financing not being obtained
on the Closing Date (it being understood that Buyers receipt of any Financing
or any of the financial statements or other documents or information
contemplated by _Section_ __ _ 4.11_ and _4.12_ is not a condition to
Buyers or Merger Subs obligation to consummate the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement).

 

(c) Since the date hereof, there shall not have occurred a Company Material
Adverse Effect.

 

(d) The Company shall have delivered to Buyer a certificate signed on behalf

and warranties made as of a particular date (in which case such

each case, except where the failure of such representations and warranties to

material adverse effect on Buyers or Merger Subs ability to consummate the
transactions contemplated hereby. Each of Buyer and Merger Sub shall have
performed and complied in all material respects with all covenants and
agreements required by this Agreement to be performed or complied with by it
on or prior to the Closing Date. Buyer shall have delivered to the Company a

TERMINATION, AMENDMENT AND WAIVER

 

7.1 _Termination_. This Agreement may be terminated at any time prior to the
Closing Date:

 

(a) by mutual written consent of the Parties;

 

(b) by either the Company or Buyer by written notice to the other, if the
Closing Date shall not have occurred on or before August 14, 2019 (the "
_Outside Date_ "); _provided, however,_ that (i) the right to terminate this
Agreement under this _Section_ __ _ 7.1(b)_ shall not be available to any
Party whose breach of a representation or warranty or failure to fulfill any
covenant or other agreement under this Agreement is the principal cause of, or
resulted in the failure of, the Merger to occur on or before such date and
(ii) if the satisfaction, or waiver by the appropriate Party, of all of the
conditions contained in _Article 5_ and _Article 6_ (other than those
conditions that by their nature only can be satisfied by actions taken at the
Closing, but subject to such conditions being able to be satisfied at the
Closing) occurs four (4) Business Days or less

 



55

    

 before the Outside Date, then neither Buyer nor the Company will be
permitted to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 7.1(b)_
until the fourth Business Day after the Outside Date; _provided_ , _further_
, that no Party will have the right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to
this _Section_ __ _ 7.1(b)_ during the pendency of a legal proceeding by any
other Party for specific performance pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 8.14_;

(c) by either the Company or Buyer, by written notice to the other, if any
Governmental Entity of competent jurisdiction shall have issued any injunction
or other Litigation or Action permanently restraining, enjoining or otherwise
prohibiting the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby and such
injunction or other Litigation or Action shall have become final and non-
appealable;

 

(d) by Buyer, by written notice to the Company, if (i) the Company is in
breach of the representations or warranties made by it in _Article 2_ or any
covenant set forth in this Agreement, (ii) such breach is not cured within ten
(10) Business Days (or, with respect to the Companys failure to consummate
the Closing when required pursuant to this Agreement, five (5) Business Days)
of written notice of such breach from Buyer (to the extent such breach is
curable) and (iii) such breach, if not cured, would render the conditions set
forth in _Article 5_ to not be satisfied;  _provided, however_ , that Buyer
shall not be entitled to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this _Section_
__ _ 7.1(d)_ if there has been a breach of this Agreement by Buyer that has
prevented or would prevent satisfaction of any condition set forth in
_Section_ __ _ 6.1_;

(e) by the Company, by written notice to Buyer, if (i) Buyer is in breach of
the representations or warranties made by it in _Article 3_ or any covenant
set forth in this Agreement, (ii) such breach is not cured within ten (10)
Business Days (or, with respect to Buyers or Merger Subs failure to
consummate the Closing when required pursuant to this Agreement, five (5)
Business Days) of written notice of such breach from the Company (to the
extent such breach is curable) and (iii) such breach, if not cured, would
render the conditions set forth in _Article 6_ not to be satisfied; _provided,
however_ , that the Company shall not be entitled to terminate this Agreement
pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 7.1(e)_ if there has been a breach of this
Agreement by the Company that has prevented or would prevent satisfaction of
any condition set forth in _Section_ __ _ 5.1(a)_ or _5.1(b)_ ;

 

(f) by Buyer by written notice to the Company, if, at any time following the
date hereof and prior to the Closing, there shall occur a Company Material
Adverse Effect and such Company Material Adverse Effect is continuing and not
cured within ten (10) Business Days of written notice of such Company Material
Adverse Effect from Buyer; or

 

(g) from and after 11:59 P.M. ET on the date of this Agreement, by Buyer if,
and only if, the Requisite Company Securityholder Approval shall not have
been obtained.

7.2 _Effect of Termination_. If this Agreement is terminated as provided
in this Article 7, this Agreement shall forthwith become void and have no
effect, without liability on the part of the Parties and their respective
Affiliates, or any of their respective directors, managers, officers, members
or equityholders, except that (a) _ Section_ __ _ 4.12(e)_, this _Article
7_ and _Article 8_ shall survive any such termination, and (b) no such
termination shall relieve any Party from any liabilities, losses, damages,
obligations, costs or expenses (which the Parties acknowledge and agree will
not

 



56

    

 be limited to reimbursement of expenses or out-of-pocket costs, and will
include the benefit of the bargain lost by the Company or the Company
Securityholders, taking into consideration relevant matters, including other
combination opportunities and the time value of money, which will be deemed in
such event to be damages of the Company) by reason of any knowing and
intentional breach of this Agreement or Actual Fraud. For purposes of
clarification, if Buyer or Merger Sub does not consummate the Closing within
five (5) Business Days following the date on which Buyer was required to
consummate the Closing pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 1.3_ (whether or not the
Debt Financing or Equity Financing has been or is capable of being funded),
such failure to consummate the Closing shall be deemed to be a knowing and
intentional breach (within the meaning of this _Section_ __ _ 7.2_) by such
Persons of this Agreement.

7.3  _Amendment_. This Agreement may be amended at any time after execution
of this Agreement by a written instrument signed by (a) Buyer and (b) if prior
to the Closing, the Company and, if after the Closing, the
Securityholder Representative; _provided_ that none of this _Section_ __ _
7.3_, _Section_ __ _ 7.4_, _Section_ __ _ 8.3_, _Section_ __ _ 8.7_,
_Section_ __ _ 8.12_,  _Section_ __ _ 8.13_ or _Section_ __ _ 8.16(c)_
(and any other provision of this Agreement to the extent a modification,
waiver or termination of such other provision would modify the substance of
any of the foregoing Sections as they relate to the Financing Sources) shall
be amended in a manner that is materially adverse to any Financing Source
without the prior written consent of such Financing Sources party to the
applicable Commitment Arrangement that have consent rights over amendments to
this Agreement.

7.4 _Waiver_. At any time prior to the Closing Date, either the Company or
Buyer may (a) extend the time for the performance of any of the obligations or
other acts of the Company (in the case of a waiver by Buyer) or Buyer, Merger
Sub or Parent Guarantor (in the case of a waiver by the Company) or (b) waive
compliance with any of the covenants or agreements of the Company (in the case
of a waiver by Buyer) or Buyer, Merger Sub or Parent Guarantor (in the case of
a waiver by the Company) or any conditions to its own obligations, in each
case only to the extent such obligations, agreements and conditions are
intended for its benefit; _provided_ that (i) any such extension or waiver
shall be binding upon a Party only if such extension or waiver is set forth in
a writing executed by such Party, and (ii) no such __ modification or waiver
of any of this _Section_ __ _ 7.4_, _Section_ __ _ 7.3_, _Section_ __ _
8.3_,  _Section_ __ _ 8.7_, _Section_ __ _ 8.12_, _Section_ __ _ 8.13_ or
_Section_ __ _ 8.16(c)_ (and any other provision of this Agreement to the
extent a modification, waiver or termination of such other provision would
modify the substance of any of the foregoing Sections as they relate to the
Financing Sources) in a manner that is materially adverse to any Financing
Source shall be made without the prior written consent of such Financing
Sources party to the applicable Commitment Arrangement that have consent
rights over modifications or waivers to this Agreement.

delivered pursuant

 



57

    

 hereto shall not survive beyond the Effective Time and shall terminate on
the Effective Time, and there shall be no liability or obligation in respect
thereof, whether such liability or obligation has accrued prior to or after

8.3 _No Third Party Beneficiary_. This Agreement shall not confer any right
or remedy upon any Person (including any Person making a claim by or through
Buyer, Merger Sub or their Affiliates under this Agreement) other than the
Parties and their respective successors and permitted assigns; _provided_ , 
_however_ , that (a) the provisions of _Section_ __ _ 4.6_ concerning
indemnification are intended for the benefit of the DandO Indemnified Persons,
and such provisions of _Section_ __ _ 4.6_ shall expressly inure to the
benefit of the DandO Indemnified Persons and the DandO Indemnified Persons shall
be entitled to rely on and enforce such provisions of _Section_ __ _ 4.6_,

Sources, and each such Section referenced in this clause (b) of this 
_Section_ __ _ 8.3_ shall expressly inure to the benefit of the applicable
Financing Sources and the applicable Financing Sources shall be entitled to
rely on and enforce the provisions of such Sections.

 

8.4 _Public Announcements_ _; Confidentiality_.

 

(a) The initial press release regarding this Agreement shall be made at such
time and in such form as Buyer and the Company agree. If Buyer and the
Company cannot agree on the initial press release, then, from the date hereof
until the Closing, either such Party shall be permitted to make any disclosure
relating to the matters contemplated by this Agreement that may be required
by Law or the rules or regulations of any exchange to which it is subject;
_provided_ that the Party proposing to issue any press release or similar
public announcement or communication in compliance with any such disclosure
obligation shall use reasonable best efforts to consult in good faith with
the other Party before doing so. Following the Closing and the initial press
release, none of Buyer, the Company, the Securityholder Representative or any
of its or their respective Affiliates shall issue or make any subsequent
press release or public statement with respect to this Agreement or the
transactions contemplated hereby containing any substantive information in
addition to that previously permitted to be disclosed pursuant to this
_Section 8.4_ without the prior consent of Buyer and the Securityholder
Representative, except as (a) __ may be required by Law or the rules or
regulations of any exchange to which it is subject or (b) __ consistent with
any previous public disclosures regarding this Agreement and the transactions
contemplated hereby; _provided_ that the Party proposing to issue any press
release or similar public announcement or communication in compliance with
any such disclosure obligation shall use reasonable best efforts to consult in
good faith with the other Party before doing so.

 

(b) The Confidentiality Agreement is terminated as of the date hereof and is
of no further force or effect. During the period from the date hereof through
the earlier of (x) two (2) years following the termination of this Agreement
in accordance with its terms and (y) the Closing Date, Buyer shall, and shall
cause its Representatives to, keep the Confidential Information confidential
and not disclose any of it to any Person in any manner whatsoever or use the
Confidential Information for any purpose other than in furtherance of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement; _provided_ ,  _however_ , that
Buyer may (i) make any disclosure of the Confidential Information to which the
Company gives its prior written consent, (ii) disclose any of such information
to such Representatives who need to know such information and who are advised
of the confidentiality obligations that attach to the Confidential Information
(it being agreed that Buyer will be responsible for any violation of the
provisions of this _Section_ __ _ 8.4(b)_ by any of its Representatives),
and (iii) disclose that information which, on the advice of counsel, is

 



60

    

 required to be disclosed by Law or pursuant to a demand of any Governmental
Entity (which requirement or demand shall not have been caused by any act of
Buyer or its Representatives in violation of this Agreement). Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary in the foregoing, in the event that Buyer or any of
its Representatives is required to or reasonably believes that it is required
by Law to disclose any of the Confidential Information, such party shall, to
the extent legally permissible, provide the Company with prompt written notice
of any such requirement so that the Company may seek (at its cost and expense)
a protective order or other appropriate remedy or waive compliance with the
provisions of this Agreement; _provided_ that, in the event that such
protective order or other appropriate remedy or waiver by the Company is not
obtained or granted, and Buyer or any of its Representatives is nonetheless,
on the advice of counsel, required by Law to disclose Confidential
Information, such Person may disclose to, or as required by, the applicable
Governmental Entity only that portion of the Confidential Information that
such counsel advises is legally required to be disclosed (and any such
disclosure shall be made only to such Persons to whom such counsel advises
such information is legally required to be disclosed); _provided_ that Buyer
and its Representatives shall exercise reasonable best efforts (at their cost
and expense) to preserve the confidentiality of the Confidential Information,
including by reasonably cooperating with the Company to obtain an appropriate
protective order or other reliable assurance that confidential treatment will
be accorded the Confidential Information.

8.5 _Fees and Expenses_. The fees and expenses incurred or accrued by the
Company and the Company Securityholders prior to the Closing (solely to the
extent such amounts are a liability of the Company as of or following the
Closing) in connection with the preparation, execution and performance of
this Agreement, the other Transaction Documents and the transactions
contemplated hereby and thereby, including (a) fees and disbursements of
counsel, financial advisors, consultants and accountants retained or acting in
connection with this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby, (b)
any sale bonus, change in control bonus, retention or transaction bonus, or
any similar compensatory amount that accelerates or becomes payable upon or in
connection with the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement without the occurrence of any other event or circumstance (and not
conditioned upon a subsequent action taken by Buyer or its Affiliates
(including the Company at the direction of Buyer) at or following the
Closing), (c) the employer portion of any payroll, employment or similar Taxes
incurred with respect to any payment described in _clause (b)_ and the
aggregate amount of the Merger Consideration payable to the
Company Securityholders in respect of Options and Restricted Shares and (d)
fifty percent (50%) of any Transfer Taxes (the " _Company Transaction
Expenses_ ") shall be borne by the Company Securityholders in the calculation
of Net Merger Consideration or, in the event the Closing does not occur, by
the Company. The expenses incurred by Buyer and Merger Sub in connection with
the preparation, execution and performance of this Agreement, the other
Transaction Documents and the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby,
including (i) all fees and expenses incurred in connection with the Escrow
Agreement and Paying Agent Agreement, (ii) all filing or other fees incurred
in connection with obtaining any necessary or appropriate governmental
approval, including approvals under the HSR Act and any other applicable
Antitrust Laws and (iii) all fees, costs and expenses of obtaining the "tail"
policies contemplated by  _Section_ __ _ 4.6(c)_ shall be paid by Buyer (and
shall not be borne by the Company Securityholders as a reduction to the Merger
Consideration, as Company Transaction Expense or otherwise).

 



61

    

8.6 _Entire Agreement_. This Agreement (including the Company Disclosure
Schedule, the Exhibits and other Schedules hereto, the Escrow Agreement and
the Paying Agent Agreement) and any collateral agreement executed in
connection with the consummation of the transactions contemplated herein
together contain the entire agreement among the Parties with respect to the
Merger and related transactions and supersede all prior agreements and
understandings, written or oral, with respect thereto.

 

8.7 _Governing Law_. This Agreement (including any dispute, claim or
controversy arising out of or relating to this Agreement or the transactions
contemplated hereby) shall be governed by, and construed in accordance with,
the Laws of the State of Delaware, without regard to conflict of law
principles that would result in the application of any Law, including
any applicable statute of limitations, other than the Laws of the State of
Delaware; _provided_ that all claims or causes of action (whether at law, in
equity, in contract, in tort or otherwise) against any of the Financing
Sources in any way relating to the Financing or the performance thereof shall
be exclusively governed by, and construed in accordance with, the Laws of the
State of New York, without giving effect to any choice of law or conflict of
law provision or rule (whether of the State of New York or any other
jurisdiction) that would cause the application of the Laws of any jurisdiction
other than the State of New York. Notwithstanding anything herein to the
contrary, for the avoidance of doubt, any determination regarding whether a
Company Material Adverse Effect has occurred under this Agreement or the
Commitment Arrangements will be determined in accordance with the Laws of the
State of Delaware.

 

8.8 _Binding Effect; No Assignment_. This Agreement shall be binding upon and
inure to the benefit of the Parties and their respective successors and
permitted assigns. This Agreement is not assignable without the prior written
consent of the other Parties; _provided_ that Buyer may assign all or any
portion of its rights and obligations under this Agreement without such
consent to (a) any wholly owned U.S. Subsidiary of Parent Guarantor or (b) any
lender (or any agent or other representative thereof) under the Debt
Commitment Letter or any of Buyers other financing arrangements
as collateral security for Buyers obligations thereunder (including any
refinancings, extensions, refundings, or renewals thereof), in each case which
assignment shall not relieve Buyer of its obligations hereunder. Any
assignment in violation of this _Section_ __ _ 8.8_ shall be void _ab
initio_.

8.9 _Article_ __ _ and Section_ __ _ Headings; Construction_. The headings
of Articles and Sections in this Agreement are provided for convenience only
and will not affect its construction or interpretation. Unless otherwise
specified, all references to "Article," "Articles," "Section" or "Sections"
refer to the corresponding Article, Articles, Section or Sections of this
Agreement. The Company Disclosure Schedule and the Exhibits and other
Schedules to this Agreement are a part of this Agreement as if fully set
forth herein. All words used in this Agreement will be construed to be of such
gender or number as the circumstances require. Unless otherwise expressly
provided, the word "including" does not limit the successive words or terms
and shall have the meaning "including, without limitation," whether or not so
specified. If any period expires on a day that is not a Business Day or any

relief is an integral part of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
