CERTAIN TRANSACTIONS AND TERMS OF MERGER

 

2.1 Merger. Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, at the
Effective Date, CMBC will be merged with and into IBKC in accordance with the
Merger Agreement, this Agreement, and the LBCL.

2.2 Conversion of CMBC Common Stock. 

(a) Except for shares of CMBC Common Stock as to which dissenters rights have
been perfected and not withdrawn or otherwise forfeited ("Dissenters
Shares") under the LBCL, and as otherwise provided herein, at the Effective
Date each outstanding share of CMBC Common Stock will be converted into the
"Merger Consideration" pursuant to the Exchange Ratio set forth below:

 



\- 4 -  thousandth of a share) to be exchanged for each share of CMBC Common Stock and
cash (without interest) payable with respect to any fractional share of IBKC
Common Stock (as determined below); or 
---|---|--- 



     | (ii) | if the Market Value is greater than $61.81 per share, the
adjusted Exchange Ratio shall equal the quotient (to the nearest thousandth of
a share) obtained by dividing $214.11 by the Market Value; or 
---|---|--- 



     | (iii) | if the Market Value is less than $50.57 per share, the
adjusted Exchange Ratio shall equal the quotient (to the nearest thousandth of
a share) obtained by dividing $175.17 by the Market Value; plus 
---|---|--- 



     | (iv) | in lieu of issuing any fractional share of IBKC Common
Stock which would otherwise be distributable to a CMBC shareholder as
determined following application of Section 2.2(a)(i), (a)(ii) or (a)(iii)
above, each holder of CMBC Common Stock who would otherwise be entitled
thereto, after aggregating into whole shares all fractional shares of IBKC
Common Stock to which such holder is entitled by virtue of the Merger, upon
surrender of the certificate(s) which represented CMBC Common Stock, will
receive, without interest, cash equal to such fractional share multiplied by
the Market Value. 
---|---|--- 
 

(b) Shares of CMBC Common Stock that are held by CMBC and any CMBC Subsidiary
(other than shares held in a fiduciary capacity) shall not be considered to
be outstanding and shall be cancelled (and not converted) by virtue of the
Merger at the Effective Date and without any further action by any party.

(c) If, before the Effective Date, IBKC should split, reclassify, recapitalize
or combine the IBKC Common Stock, or pay a stock dividend in IBKC Common
Stock, or otherwise change the IBKC Common Stock into any other securities,
or make any other dividend or distribution in respect of the IBKC Common Stock
(other than normal cash dividends consistent with past practices as the same
may be adjusted from time to time in accordance with or not in violation of
this Agreement), and the record date therefore is prior to the Effective Date,
then the Exchange Ratios will be appropriately and proportionately adjusted to
reflect such split, reclassification, recapitalization, combination,
stock dividend or other distribution or change.

(d) No later than the Effective Date, IBKC shall deposit, or shall cause to
be deposited, with the Exchange Agent for the benefit of the holders of CMBC
Common Stock, for exchange in accordance with this Section 2.2, certificates
and cash (in immediately available funds) representing the Merger
Consideration to be paid. After the Effective Date, each holder of CMBC
Common Stock (other than Dissenters Shares), upon surrender of such holders
Certificates in accordance herewith, will be entitled promptly to receive the
Merger Consideration into which such holders shares have been converted.
Until then, each Certificate for CMBC Common Stock will represent the Merger
Consideration into which the shares of CMBC Common Stock represented thereby
were converted, except that IBKC may refuse to pay any dividend or other
distribution payable to the holder of any unsurrendered Certificate for CMBC
Common Stock (without any interest thereon) until surrender, following which
such dividend or other distribution will be promptly paid, or if
such dividend or distribution has reverted in full ownership to IBKC under
its Articles of Incorporation. Whether or not a Certificate for CMBC Common
Stock is surrendered, after the Effective Date it will not represent any
interest in any Person other than IBKC.

(e) Prior to the Effective Date, IBKC or the Exchange Agent shall mail to each
holder of record of a Certificate or Certificates a form of letter of
transmittal (which shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of
loss and title to the Certificates shall pass, only upon delivery of the
Certificates, or affidavits of loss in lieu thereof in form and substance
reasonably satisfactory to the Exchange Agent, to the Exchange Agent) and
instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the Certificates in
exchange for the Merger Consideration into which the shares of CMBC Common
Stock represented by such Certificate or Certificates shall have been
converted pursuant to this Section 2.2. Upon proper surrender of a Certificate
for exchange and cancellation to the Exchange Agent, together with a properly
completed letter of transmittal, duly executed, the holder of such
Certificate shall be entitled to receive promptly in exchange therefore (i) a
certificate representing that number of shares of IBKC Common Stock to which
such former holder of CMBC Common Stock shall have become entitled pursuant
to this

 



\- 5 -   Agreement and (ii) a check representing that amount of cash to which such
former holder of CMBC Common Stock shall have become entitled pursuant to this
Agreement.

 

(f) In the event any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed,
upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the person claiming such
Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and the posting by such person of
a bond in such amount as IBKC may reasonably direct as indemnity against any
claim that may be made against it with respect to such Certificate, the
Exchange Agent will issue in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed
Certificate the Merger Consideration deliverable in respect thereof. CMBC may,
after prior notice to IBKC, issue replacement Certificates for any lost,
stolen or destroyed Certificates prior to the Effective Date upon receipt of
affidavits of loss and/or other documents reasonably satisfactory to CMBC,
without, if appropriate, the posting of a bond and subject to Section 6.1(c).

 

(g) If the Person surrendering a Certificate and signing the accompanying
letter of transmittal is not the record holder thereof, then it shall be a
condition of the payment of the Merger Consideration that: (i) such
Certificate is properly endorsed to such Person or is accompanied by
appropriate stock powers, in either case signed exactly as the name of the
record holder appears on such Certificate, and is otherwise in proper form
for transfer, or is accompanied by appropriate evidence of the authority of
the Person surrendering such Certificate and signing the letter of transmittal
to do so on behalf of the record holder; and (ii) the person requesting such
exchange shall pay to the Exchange Agent in advance any transfer or other
similar taxes required by reason of the payment to a Person other than the
registered holder of the Certificate surrendered, or required for any other
reason, or shall establish to the satisfaction of the Exchange Agent that such
tax has been paid or is not payable.

(h) If necessary, IBKC shall prepare and file with the SEC, promptly after the
Effective Date, a registration statement on Form S-8 (or other appropriate
form) registering a number of shares of IBKC Common Stock necessary to
exchange shares of CMBC Common Stock held in the Plan (as defined below) into
shares of IBKC Common Stock.

terminated at or immediately prior to the Effective Date. Upon the request of
IBKC, which request shall be provided no less than twenty (20) days prior to
the Effective Date, CMBC (or its applicable Subsidiary) shall use its best
efforts to terminate the Employment Agreements listed in Schedule 2.3(a) that
are designated in writing by IBKC, provided that the Employment and Change of

instrument in writing signed by the employee acknowledging (i) receipt of
said payment as full payment for all amounts due and payable to such employee
thereunder and (ii) the termination of said Employment Agreement, effective

Employment Agreements listed in Schedule 2.3(a) and specified by IBKC, IBKC
will assume such Employment Agreement(s) and comply with the terms thereof.
At or prior to the Effective Date, CMBC (or its applicable Subsidiary) shall
use its reasonable efforts to amend the Employment COC Agreement, effective as
of the Effective Date, to provide that any payment due to the employee
thereunder as a result of termination of her employment within twelve (12)
months after the Effective Date will be conditioned on her not resigning or
being terminated for Cause (as defined in such agreement) prior to the earlier
of (i) substantial completion of conversion of CMBC systems to IBKC systems

reasonable efforts, CMBC is unable to terminate the Employment COC Agreement,

thereof.

(b) _Schedule 2.3(b)_ sets forth a list of all of the Change of Control
Agreements other than the Employment COC Agreement (collectively, the "COC

set forth on _Schedule 2.3(b)_ pursuant to said COC Agreements. At or prior
to the Effective Date, CMBC (or its applicable Subsidiary) shall use its best
efforts to terminate the COC Agreements listed in _Schedule 2.3(b)_ , and,
upon such termination, pay to the employees listed on  _Schedule 2.3(b)_ the
amounts, without material deviation, as set forth on _Schedule 2.3(b)_ against
delivery by each listed employee of an instrument in writing signed by the
employee acknowledging (i) receipt of said payment as full payment for all
amounts due and payable to such employee thereunder and (ii) the termination
of said COC Agreement, effective immediately upon the execution and delivery
of said acknowledgment. If, notwithstanding its best efforts, CMBC is unable
to terminate one or more COC Agreements listed in _Schedule 2.3(b)_ , IBKC
will assume such COC Agreement(s) and comply with the terms thereof.

(c) Schedule 2.3(c) sets forth a list of all of the Supplemental Executive
Retirement Agreements (collectively, the "SERP Agreements") which CMBC has or
expects to enter into between CMBC (or its applicable Subsidiary) and their
respective employees and the estimated net present value of the fully vested
benefits as of the Effective Date, assuming the following: (i) full vesting of
all participants; (ii) a lump sum payment as of March 1, 2011 equal to the
present value of all benefits accrued as of such date; and (iii) a present
value calculation based on the ten (10)-year U.S. Government bond rate as
established in the Wall Street Journal on the last day of the month prior to
the month for which the present value calculation is performed. At or prior to
the Effective Date CMBC or its applicable Subsidiary shall amend each of the
SERP Agreements effective as the Effective Date as follows: (I) to freeze
each of the SERP Agreements (other than the SERP Agreement identified as Item
Number 8 on Schedule 2.3(c)("SERP Agreement No. 8"), which, by its terms, does
not provide for any further increase in benefits), effective at or prior to
the Effective Date (so that the benefits provided for thereunder will no
longer increase over time); (II) to delete any SERP Agreement provisions
requiring mutual consent to amend the SERP Agreement (including but not
limited to the first sentence of Section XIII.B. of SERP Agreement No. 8),
and replace such provisions with a provision substantially similar to Section
8.1 of the SERP Agreement identified as Item No. 1 on Schedule 2.3(c)("SERP
Agreement No. 1"); (III) to provide that, upon termination of the SERP
Agreement on or after the ninth (9th) anniversary of the Effective Date (or,
if earlier, the date on which all of the benefits under SERP Agreement No. 1
have been paid to the executive thereunder or his beneficiaries), the
benefits under such SERP Agreement shall be paid to the participant or
beneficiary no less than 12 months, and no more than 24 months, after
termination of the SERP Agreement ( _i.e._ in accordance with Section 409A);
and (IV) to provide for a method of determining the lump sum benefit noted in
Section 2.3(c)(III) above that is substantially similar to the method of
determining the lump sum payment under the SERP Agreement in the event of
death of the participant. IBKC will assume the SERP Agreements as of the
Effective Date, at which time IBKC shall have discretion to terminate the SERP
Agreements in accordance with their terms and Section 409A of the Code
and the regulations thereunder ("Section 409A"); provided that no SERP
Agreement will be terminated if the payment to be made upon the termination
would trigger an excess parachute payment under Section 280G of the Code that
would not be triggered in the case of payment under the current terms of the
SERP Agreement and provided further that no SERP Agreement will be terminated
before the ninth (9th) anniversary of the Effective Date or the date on which
all of the SERP Agreement benefits owed to the executive under SERP Agreement
No. 1 or his beneficiaries have been paid, whichever is earlier. In the event
of termination of the SERP Agreements, IBKC shall pay the benefits due under
the SERP Agreements in accordance with Treasury Regulation Section
1.409A-3(j)(4).

(other than the SERP Agreements) (collectively, the "Deferred Comp

pursuant to said Deferred Comp Agreements. At or prior to the Effective Date,

without material deviation, as set forth on Schedule 2.3(d) against delivery
by each listed employee of an instrument in writing signed by the employee
acknowledging (i) receipt of said payment as full payment for all amounts due
and payable to such employee thereunder and (ii) the termination of said
Deferred Comp Agreement, effective immediately upon the execution and
delivery of said acknowledgment. If, notwithstanding its best efforts, CMBC is
unable to terminate one or more Deferred Comp Agreements listed in Schedule
2.3(d) (other than the Severance Plan), IBKC will assume such Deferred
Comp Agreement(s) and comply with the terms thereof. With

 



\- 7 -   respect to the Severance Plan, IBKC will assume such plan and either comply
with the terms thereof or terminate the Severance Plan and provide to the
employees covered thereunder coverage under a plan of IBKC that provides an
equivalent or greater benefit.

which CMBC has or expects to enter into between CMBC (or its applicable
Subsidiary) and their respective employees.

(f) Any action (including but not limited to any payment) under this Section
2.3 shall be subject to compliance with Section 409A of the Code and the
regulations thereunder ("Section 409A"), provided that the timing of any
payment under this Section 2.3 may be delayed only if such delay is necessary
to comply with Section 409A. With respect to any action required under this
Section 2.3 to be taken or any payment to be made by CMBC, in the event that
compliance with Section 409A requires that the action be taken or the payment
be made after the Effective Date, IBKC will assume the obligation to take such
action or make such payment, and will make such payment at the earliest
possible date that is in compliance with Section 409A.

those persons serving as directors and officers of IBKC prior to the Effective
Date.

4.3 Employees and Benefits.

(a) The employees of CMBC and its Subsidiaries who remain employed after the
Effective Date ("Continuing Employees") shall be given credit under each
employee benefit plan, policy, program and arrangement maintained by
IBERIABANK after the Closing for their service with CMBC or its Subsidiary (or
with any predecessor for whom CMBC or its Subsidiary gave them credit) prior
to the Closing for all purposes, including severance, vacation and sick leave,
eligibility to participate, vesting, satisfying any waiting periods, evidence
of insurability requirements in accordance with IBKCs plan, seniority, or
the application of any pre-existing condition limitations, other than benefit
accrual under a defined benefit plan (as defined in Section 3(35) of ERISA);
_provided, however_ , that accrued vacation taken subsequent to the Effective
Date may be subject to such limitations as IBKC or IBERIABANK may reasonably
require and that apply generally to all employees of IBKC and IBERIABANK.

 

(b) Any employee of CMBC or its Subsidiaries who does not remain employed by
IBKC or its Subsidiaries after the Effective Date and who does not receive a
severance payment in connection with the Merger shall receive a severance
payment from IBKC as if he or she were an employee of IBKC for the entire time
he or she were an employee of CMBC. No former employee of CMBC shall
receive a change of control or severance payment from IBKC if he or she
received a change of control payment from CMBC, unless provided otherwise
pursuant to an agreement entered into between IBKC and such employee, and CMBC
shall, prior to the Effective Date, use best efforts to take all steps, and
obtain such consents, as may be necessary to effectuate this Section 4.3(b).

 

(c) In the event of any termination of any CMBC or CMBC Subsidiary health plan
(a "CMBC health plan"), IBKC and IBERIABANK shall make available to
Continuing Employees and their dependents, employer-provided health care
coverage under health plans provided by IBKC and IBERIABANK. Unless a
Continuing Employee affirmatively terminates coverage under a CMBC health
plan prior to the time that such Continuing Employee becomes eligible to
participate in the IBKC health plan, no coverage of any of the Continuing
Employees or their dependents shall terminate under any of the CMBC health
plans prior to the time such Continuing Employees and their dependents become
eligible to participate in the health plans, programs and benefits common to
all employees and their dependents of IBKC and IBERIABANK. In the event IBKC
terminates any CMBC health plan or consolidates any CMBC health plan with any
IBKC health plan, individuals covered by the CMBC health plan shall be
entitled to immediate coverage under the IBKC health plan in accordance with
the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, as amended,
and the regulations issued thereunder, including limitations on pre-existing
condition exclusions, nondiscrimination and special enrollment rights.

4.4 Indemnification and Insurance.

(a) IBKC agrees that all rights to indemnification and all limitations of
liability existing in favor of any director or officer of CMBC or any CMBC
Subsidiary (the "Indemnified Parties") as provided in CMBCs or the CMBC
Subsidiarys articles of incorporation or bylaws (including without
limitation the right to the advancement of expenses) with respect to matters
occurring on or prior to the Effective Date shall survive the Merger and shall
continue in full force and effect, without any amendment thereto, for a
period of six (6) years from the Effective Date; _provided, however_ , that
all rights to indemnification in respect of any claim, suit, proceeding,
investigation, or other action ("Claim") asserted or made within such period
shall continue until the final disposition of such Claim; _provided further_ ,
however, that nothing contained in this Section 4.4(a) shall be deemed to
preclude

 



\- 9 -   the liquidation, consolidation or merger of CMBC or any CMBC Subsidiary, in
which case all of such rights to indemnification and limitations on liability
shall be deemed to so survive and continue notwithstanding any such
liquidation, consolidation or merger and shall constitute rights which may be
asserted against IBKC. Nothing contained in this Section 4.4(a) shall be
deemed to preclude any rights to indemnification or limitations on liability
provided in CMBCs or any CMBC Subsidiarys articles of incorporation with
respect to matters occurring subsequent to the Effective Date.

(b) Any Indemnified Party wishing to claim indemnification under Section 4.4,
upon learning of any claim, shall notify IBKC thereof in writing as promptly
as is practicable; _provided, however_ , that failure to so notify IBKC shall
not relieve IBKC from any liability that would otherwise arise under this
Section 4.4 except to the extent such failure prejudices IBKC. IBKC shall have
the right to assume the defense thereof and shall not be liable for any
expenses subsequently incurred by such Indemnified Party in connection with
the defense thereof, except that if IBKC does not assume or continue to pursue
such defense, or counsel for the Indemnified Party advises in writing
that issues raise conflicts of interest between IBKC and the Indemnified
Party, then the Indemnified Party may retain counsel satisfactory to such
Indemnified Party (and reasonably satisfactory to IBKC) at IBKCs expense;
_provided, however_ , that (i) IBKC shall not be obligated to pay for more
than one counsel for all Indemnified Parties in any jurisdiction except as may
be required due to conflicts of interest; (ii) the Indemnified Parties will
cooperate (to the extent reasonably appropriate under the circumstances) in
the defense of any such claim; and (iii) IBKC shall not be liable for any
settlement effected without the prior written consent of IBKC, which consent
may be withheld unless such settlement is reasonable in light of such claims,
actions, suits, proceedings or investigations against, and defenses available
to, such Indemnified Party.

(c) CMBC will, for total premiums not to exceed $85,000 (the "Maximum
Amount"), purchase a continuation of their current directors and officers
liability insurance for a coverage period of three (3) years after the
Merger, provided that if the amount of the annual premiums necessary to
maintain or procure such insurance coverage exceeds the Maximum Amount, IBKC
shall maintain the most advantageous policies of directors and officers
insurance obtainable for an aggregate annual premium not to exceed the Maximum
Amount.

(d) If IBKC or any of its successors or assigns (i) reorganizes or
consolidates with or merges into or enters into another business combination
transaction with any other Person or entity and is not the resulting,
continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such reorganization,
consolidation, merger or transaction or (ii) liquidates, dissolves or
transfers all or substantially all of its properties and assets to any Person
or entity, then, and in each such case, proper provisions will be made
so that such surviving corporation or transferee and its successors and
assigns assume the obligations of IBKC set forth in this Agreement. The
obligations of IBKC under this Section 4.4 are intended to be for the benefit
of, and enforceable against IBKC directly by, the Indemnified Parties and
their heirs and representatives and shall be binding on all respective
successors and permitted assigns of IBKC. IBKC shall pay all reasonable costs,
including attorneys fees, that may be incurred by any Indemnified Party in
successfully enforcing the indemnity and other obligations provided for in
this Section 4.4 to the fullest extent permitted under applicable law. The
rights of each Indemnified Party hereunder shall be in addition to any other
rights such Indemnified Party may have under applicable law. The provisions of
this Section 4.4 shall survive the Effective Date.

SECTION V.

REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF IBKC AND CMBC 

IBKC and CMBC hereby represent and warrant to the other Warrantor, subject to
the standard set forth in Section 5.21 hereof, that:

5.1 Organization, Standing, and Authority. Warrantor is a corporation duly
organized, validly existing, and in good standing under the laws of the state
of Louisiana, and is duly qualified to do business and in good standing in the
states of the United States and foreign jurisdictions where its ownership or
leasing of property or the conduct of its business requires it to be so
qualified, except where the failure to be so qualified or in good standing
would not have a Material Adverse Effect. Warrantor has corporate power and
authority to carry on its business as now conducted in all material respects,
to own, lease and operate its assets, properties and business, and to execute
and deliver, and to perform its obligations under, this Agreement. Warrantor
is duly registered with the Federal 

 



\- 10 -   Reserve as a bank holding company under the BHC Act. Warrantor has in effect
all federal, state, local and foreign governmental authorizations necessary
for it to own or lease its properties and assets and to carry on its business
as it is now conducted in all material respects. Each of IBERIABANK and CSB is
an "insured depository institution" as defined in the Federal Deposit
Insurance Act and applicable regulations thereunder. 

5.2 Capital Stock.

(a) The authorized, issued and outstanding capital stock of Warrantor as of
the date of this Agreement, the number of shares of Warrantor Common Stock
reserved for issuance under the Warrantor Benefit Plans as of such date and
the number of shares of Warrantor Common Stock that are subject to outstanding
stock options under such Warrantor Benefit Plans as of such date, are set
forth in _Schedule 5.2(a)_ that pertains to Warrantor. All of the issued and
outstanding shares of capital stock of Warrantor are duly and validly
authorized and issued and are fully paid and non-assessable. None of the
outstanding shares of the capital stock of Warrantor has been issued in
violation of any preemptive rights of the current or past shareholders of
Warrantor. All of the IBKC Common Stock to be issued in exchange for CMBC
Common Stock upon consummation of the Merger, when issued in accordance with
the terms of this Agreement, will be duly and validly authorized and fully
paid and non-assessable.

(b) Except as set forth in Section 5.2(a), Section 6.1(e) or _Schedule
5.2(a)_ , there are, as of the date of this Agreement and will be, at the
Effective Date, no shares of capital stock or other equity securities of CMBC
outstanding and no outstanding options, warrants, scrip, rights to subscribe
to, calls or commitments of any character whatsoever relating to, or
securities or rights convertible into or exchangeable for, shares of the
capital stock of CMBC or contracts, commitments, understandings or
arrangements by which CMBC is or may be bound to issue additional shares of
its capital stock or options, warrants or rights to purchase or acquire any
additional shares of its capital stock.

5.3 Subsidiaries. _Schedule 5.3_ lists all of the Subsidiaries of Warrantor as
of the date of this Agreement. Except as provided in Louisiana Revised
Statutes 6:262, all of the shares of capital stock of IBERIABANK held by IBKC
are fully paid and non-assessable and are owned by IBKC free and clear of any
claim, lien or encumbrance. Each Subsidiary of Warrantor is a corporation duly
organized, validly existing and in good standing under the laws of the state
of its incorporation, and is duly qualified to do business and in good
standing in the jurisdictions where its ownership or leasing of property or
the conduct of its business requires it to be so qualified, except where the
failure to be so qualified or in good standing would not have a Material
Adverse Effect. Each of CSB and IBERIABANK has the corporate power and
authority necessary for it to own or lease its properties and assets and to
carry on its business as it is now being conducted, and has all federal,
state, local and foreign governmental authorizations necessary for it to own
or lease its properties and assets and to carry on its business as it is now
being conducted in all material respects.

Warrantor, subject, with respect to this Agreement, to the approval of the
shareholders of CMBC. This Agreement, subject to any requisite approval by
CMBCs shareholders (and assuming in each case the due authorization,
execution and delivery by the other Warrantor), represents the valid and
legally binding obligation of Warrantor, enforceable against Warrantor, in
accordance with its terms, except as enforceability may be limited by
applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium or other laws
affecting the enforcement of creditors rights generally and except that the
availability of the equitable remedy of specific performance or injunctive
relief is subject to the discretion of the court before which any proceeding
may be brought.

(b) Neither the execution and delivery of this Agreement by Warrantor, nor
the consummation by Warrantor of the transactions contemplated herein, nor
compliance by Warrantor with any of the provisions hereof, will (i) conflict
with or result in a breach of any provision of the articles of incorporation
or by-laws of IBKC or CMBC, or (ii) except as set forth on _Schedule 5.4(b)_
, constitute or result in the breach of any term, condition or

 



\- 11 -   provision of, or constitute a default under, or give rise to any right of

creation of any lien, charge or encumbrance upon any property or assets of
Warrantor, pursuant to, any note, bond, mortgage, indenture, license,
agreement, lease or other instrument or obligation to which any of them is a
party or by which any of them or any of their properties or assets may be
subject, except such as individually or in the aggregate will not have a
Material Adverse Effect, or (iii) subject to receipt of the requisite
approvals, authorizations, filings, registrations and notifications referred
to in Section 8.5 of this Agreement, violate any order, writ, injunction,
decree, statute, rule or regulation applicable to Warrantor, or any of its

its shareholders, (ii) authorized and approved this Agreement and the
transactions contemplated hereby, including the Merger, and (iii) in the case
of CMBCs Board of Directors only, has directed that the Merger be submitted

consolidated basis, except (i) as reflected in the Warrantor Financial

liens, encumbrances, charges or defaults of any character, to all of the

5.11 Employee Benefit Plans.

 



\- 13 -  (a) (i) Warrantor has delivered or made available to the other Warrantor,
prior to the execution of this Agreement, copies of each pension, retirement,
profit sharing, supplemental or excess retirement, stock option, stock
purchase, savings, employee stock ownership, restricted stock, phantom stock,
stock ownership, life insurance, disability, vacation pay, severance pay
(including, without limitation change of control or golden parachute
arrangements), incentive, deferred compensation, bonus or benefit arrangement,
health or hospitalization program, fringe benefit or perquisite arrangement
or other similar plan as in effect on the date of this Agreement, including,
without limitation, any "employee benefit plan", as that term is defined in
Section 3(3) of ERISA, in respect of any of the present or former directors,
officers, other employees or independent contractors of, or dependents,
spouses or other beneficiaries of any of such directors, officers, other
employees or independent contractors of, any of the Warrantor Companies
(collectively, the "Warrantor Benefit Plans"), and (ii) CMBC and the CMBC
Subsidiaries have delivered or made available to IBKC, prior to the execution
of this Agreement, copies of each employment or consulting agreement as in
effect on the date of this Agreement which provides any benefit or
perquisites to or in respect of any of the present or former directors or
officers of, or dependents, spouses or other beneficiaries of any of such
directors or officers of, CMBC and the CMBC Subsidiaries, which employment
and consulting agreements are, with respect to CMBC and the CMBC Subsidiaries,
included in the term "Warrantor Benefit Plans" as defined above. Any of the
Warrantor Benefit Plans which is an "employee pension benefit plan," as that
term is defined in Section 3(2) of ERISA, is referred to herein as a
"Warrantor ERISA Plan". No Warrantor has participated in or been a member of,
and no Warrantor Benefit Plan is or has been, a multi-employer plan within
the meaning of Section 3(37) of ERISA. Except as set forth on _Schedule
5.11(a)_ , the Warrantor Benefit Plans of CMBC and the CMBC Subsidiaries are
terminable on their terms without penalty or payment except for accrued and
vested benefits thereunder.

(b) All Warrantor Benefit Plans comply in all material respects with the
applicable provisions of ERISA and the Code, and any other applicable laws,
rules and regulations the breach or violation of which could result in a
liability, either individually or in the aggregate, material to the financial
condition, results of operations or prospects of the Warrantor on a
consolidated basis. With respect to the Warrantor Benefit Plans, no event has
occurred and, to Warrantors knowledge, there exists no condition or set of
circumstances, in connection with which the Warrantor could be subject to any
liability (except liability for severance payments, benefit claims, Pension
Benefit Guaranty Corporation premiums, and funding obligations payable in the
ordinary course). No notice of a "reportable event," as that term is defined
in Section 4043 of ERISA, for which the 30-day reporting requirement has not
been waived has been required to be filed for any Warrantor ERISA Plan which
is subject to Title IV of ERISA within the 12-month period ending on the date
of this Agreement. No Warrantor has provided, or is required to provide,
security to any Warrantor ERISA Plan which is subject to Title IV of ERISA
pursuant to Section 401(a)(20) of the Code.

 

(c) Except as set forth on _Schedule 5.11(c)_ , no Warrantor ERISA Plan which
is subject to Title IV of ERISA has any "unfunded current liability," as that
term is defined in Section 302(d)(8)(A) of ERISA, and the present fair market
value of the assets of each such plan exceeds the plans "benefit
liabilities", as that term is defined in Section 4001(a)(16) of ERISA, when
determined under actuarial factors that would apply if the plan terminated as
of the date of this Agreement in accordance with all applicable legal
requirements.

 

5.12 Material Contracts. Except, with respect to CMBC, as set forth on
_Schedule 5.12_ , and except, with respect to IBKC, as filed as an exhibit to
its most recent Form 10-K, none of the Warrantor Companies, nor any of their
respective assets, businesses or operations, as of the date of this Agreement,
is a party to, or is bound or affected by, or receives benefits under, any
contract or agreement or amendment thereto that in each case would be required
to be filed as an exhibit to a Form 10-K filed by Warrantor as of the date of
this Agreement (each such contract, agreement or amendment, a "Warrantor
Material Contract"). No Warrantor Company is in default in any material
respect under any Warrantor Material Contract, and there has not occurred any
event that, with the lapse of time or the giving of notice or both, would
constitute such a default. 

5.13 Legal Proceedings. Except as set forth on _Schedule 5.13_ , there are no
actions, suits or proceedings instituted or pending or, to Warrantors
knowledge, threatened against a Warrantor Company, or affecting any property,
asset, interest or right of any of them.

 



\- 14 -  5.14 Absence of Certain Changes or Events. Since December 31, 2009,
the Warrantor Companies, taken as a whole on a consolidated basis, have not
suffered any change in any respect that has had or, to Warrantors knowledge,
is reasonably likely to have a Material Adverse Effect.

 

5.15 Reports. Since December 31, 2007, each of the Warrantor Companies has
filed all reports and statements, together with any amendments required to be
made with respect thereto, that it was required to file with (i) the SEC,
including, but not limited to, Forms 10-K, Forms 10-Q, Forms 8-K and proxy
statements, (ii) the Federal Reserve, (iii) the Federal Deposit Insurance
Corporation, and (iv) any applicable state banking, insurance, securities or
other regulatory authorities. As of their respective dates (and without giving
effect to any amendments or modifications filed after the date of this
Agreement with respect to reports and documents filed before the date of this
Agreement), each of such reports and documents, including the financial
statements, exhibits and schedules thereto, complied in all material respects
with all of the statutes, rules and regulations enforced or promulgated by
the authority with which they were filed and did not contain any untrue
statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact necessary in
order to make the statements made therein in light of the circumstances under
which they were made not misleading.

5.16 Statements True and Correct. None of the information supplied or to be
supplied by Warrantor for inclusion in (i) the Registration Statement, (ii)
the Proxy Statement, and (iii) any other documents to be filed with the SEC or
any other Regulatory Authority in connection with the transactions
contemplated hereby, will, at the respective times such documents are filed,
and, in the case of the Registration Statement, when it becomes effective and,
with respect to the Proxy Statement, when first mailed to the shareholders of
CMBC be false or misleading with respect to any material fact, or omit to
state any material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein not
misleading, or, in the case of the Proxy Statement or any amendment
thereof or supplement thereto, at the time of the Shareholders Meeting, be
false or misleading with respect to any material fact, or omit to state any
material fact necessary to make the statements therein in light of the
circumstances under which they were made not misleading. All documents that
Warrantor is responsible for filing with the SEC or any other Regulatory
Authority in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby will comply
in all material respects with the provisions of applicable law including
applicable provisions of the Securities Laws.

purposes of this Section 5.17, the term "Warrantor Subsidiary" shall include
small business investment corporations and entities that invest in

owns or controls 5% or more of the outstanding equity securities either
directly or through an unbroken chain of entities as to each of which 5% or
more of the outstanding equity securities is owned directly or indirectly by
Warrantor), except as set forth in _Schedule 5.17(a)_ , the Warrantor

have been, in compliance in all material respects with all applicable laws,
rules, regulations and standards, and all requirements of the United States
Environmental Protection Agency ("EPA") and of state and local agencies with
jurisdiction over pollution or protection of health or the environment.

(b) To Warrantors knowledge, except as set forth in _Schedule 5.17(b),_ there
is no suit, claim, action or proceeding, pending or threatened, before any
court, governmental agency, board or other forum pursuant to which Warrantor
or any of the Warrantor Subsidiaries or any Warrantor Real Property or
Participation Facility (or in respect of such Warrantor Real Property or
Participation Facility) has been or, with respect to threatened proceedings
may be, named as a defendant (i) for alleged noncompliance (including by any
predecessor) with any environmental law, rule or regulation or (ii) relating
to the release into the environment of any Hazardous Material (as
defined below) or oil, whether or not occurring at or on any site owned
(including as trustee), leased or operated by it or any of its subsidiaries or
any Warrantor Real Property or Participation Facility.

 

(c) To Warrantors knowledge, except as set forth in _Schedule 5.17(c)_ ,
there is no reasonable basis for any suit, claim, action or proceeding of a
type described in Section 5.17(b).

knows of no reason why the regulatory approvals, authorizations, filings,
registrations and notices contemplated by Section 8.5 should not be obtained
without the imposition of any material and adverse condition or restriction.

 

5.19 Labor Matters. Except as set forth on _Schedule 5.19_ , neither Warrantor
is a party to, or is bound by, any collective bargaining agreement, contract

a Material Adverse Effect, except that the representations and warranties in
Sections 5.1, 5.2, 5.3 and 5.4 shall be true and correct in all respects.

request of IBKC.

contemplated or permitted hereby or as set forth on _Schedule 6.2,_ each
Warrantor shall operate its business only in the ordinary course of business
of such Warrantor consistent with past practices, shall preserve intact its
business organizations and assets and maintain its rights and franchises, and
shall voluntarily take no action which would (i) adversely affect the ability

Section 8.5 of this Agreement, (ii) adversely affect the ability of such
Warrantor to perform its obligations under this Agreement, or (iii) cause or
permit a breach of any of its covenants or cause or permit any representation

6.3 Adverse Changes in Condition. Each Warrantor shall give written notice
promptly to the other Warrantor concerning (i) any event which has had, or is
reasonably likely to have, a Material Adverse Effect on such Warrantor, or
(ii) the occurrence or impending occurrence of any event or circumstance known
to such Warrantor which would have needed to be reported in a disclosure
schedule hereunder if it had occurred or been pending on or prior to the date
of this Agreement, or which would cause or constitute a material breach of any
of the representations, warranties or covenants of such Warrantor contained
herein or that would reasonably be expected to materially and adversely
affect the timely consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby. Each
Warrantor shall use its reasonable efforts to prevent or to promptly remedy
the same.

6.4 Investigation and Confidentiality. Prior to the Effective Date, each
Warrantor will keep the other Warrantor promptly advised of all material
developments relevant to its business and to the consummation of the Merger
and may make or cause to be made such investigation, if any, of the business,
properties, operations and financial and legal condition of the other
Warrantor and its Subsidiaries as such Warrantor reasonably deems necessary
or advisable to familiarize itself and its advisors with such business,
properties, operations and condition; _provided, however_ , that such
investigation shall be reasonably related to the transactions contemplated
hereby and shall not interfere unnecessarily with normal operations. Each
Warrantor agrees to furnish the other Warrantor and the other Warrantors
respective advisors with such financial and operating data and other
information with respect to its business, properties and employees as the
other Warrantor shall from time to time reasonably request. No investigation

Warrantor and, subject to Section 9.3 of this Agreement, each such
representation and warranty shall survive any such investigation. Each
Warrantor agrees to furnish the other Warrantor with all information necessary

judgment, nor to disclose board minutes of any confidential discussion of
this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby. Each Warrantor shall
maintain the confidentiality of all confidential information furnished to it

after the same are filed.

6.6 Dividends. From the date of this Agreement to the earlier of
the Effective Date or the termination of this Agreement, CMBC shall not

\- 18 -   dividend to its shareholders of up to $811,000. If the Effective Date is
prior to the NASDAQ Close on June 30, 2011, the former shareholders of CMBC
who receive IBKC Common Stock in the Merger shall receive any dividend
declared and paid by IBKC in respect of the second quarter of 2011.

6.7 Capital Stock. Except as otherwise contemplated by this Agreement
(including Section 6.1(e) hereof), or as set forth on _Schedule 6.7_ , without
the prior written consent of IBKC, from the date of this Agreement to the
earlier of the Effective Date or the termination of this Agreement, CMBC
shall not, and shall not enter into any agreement to, issue, sell, or
otherwise permit to become outstanding any additional shares of CMBC Common
Stock or any other capital stock of CMBC and any Subsidiary of CMBC, or any
stock appreciation rights, or any option, warrant, conversion or other right
to acquire any such stock, or any security convertible into any such stock.

 

6.8 Certain Actions.

(a) Subject to Section 6.8(d) of this Agreement, CMBC agrees that, from the
date of this Agreement until the earlier of the Effective Date or the
termination of this Agreement, neither it nor any of its Subsidiaries, nor
any of the officers and directors of it or its Subsidiaries shall, and that it
shall cause its and its Subsidiaries employees, agents and representatives
(including any investment banker, attorney or accountant retained by it or
any of its Subsidiaries) not to, directly or indirectly, (i) initiate,
solicit, encourage or knowingly facilitate any inquiries or the making of any
Acquisition Proposal, (ii) have any discussion with or provide any
confidential information or data to any Person relating to an Acquisition
Proposal, or engage in any negotiations concerning an Acquisition Proposal, or
knowingly facilitate any effort or attempt to make or implement an Acquisition
Proposal, (iii) approve or recommend, or propose publicly to approve or
recommend, any Acquisition Proposal or (iv) approve or recommend, or propose
to approve or recommend, or execute or enter into any letter of intent,
agreement in principle, merger agreement, acquisition agreement, option
agreement or other similar agreement or propose publicly or agree to do any of
the foregoing related to any Acquisition Proposal.

(b) CMBC agrees that it will, and will cause its officers, directors and
representatives to, immediately cease and cause to be terminated any
activities, discussions or negotiations existing as of the date of this
Agreement with any parties conducted heretofore (other than IBKC) with respect
to any Acquisition Proposal informing them that the Board of Directors no
longer seeks the making of any Acquisition Proposals.

 

(c) CMBC agrees that it will use reasonable efforts to promptly inform its
directors, officers, key employees, agents and representatives of the
obligations undertaken in this Section 6.8.

(d) Notwithstanding the provisions of Section 6.8(a) of this Agreement, if
any Person after the date of this Agreement submits to CMBCs board of
directors an unsolicited, _bona_ _fide_ , written Acquisition Proposal, and
CMBCs board of directors reasonably determines in good faith, after receipt
of advice from outside legal counsel, that the failure to engage in
discussions with such Person concerning such Acquisition Proposal may cause
CMBCs board of directors to breach its fiduciary duties to CMBC and its
shareholders, and after consultation with its financial advisor, then, in
such case, (i) CMBC may (A) furnish information about its business to such
Person under protection of an appropriate confidentiality agreement containing
customary limitations on the use and disclosure of all non-public written or
oral information furnished to such Person, provided that CMBC must
contemporaneously furnish to IBKC all such non-public information furnished to
such Person, and (B) negotiate and participate in discussions and
negotiations with such Person; and (ii) if CMBCs board of directors
determines that such an Acquisition Proposal is a Superior Proposal (defined
below), CMBCs board of directors may (subject to the provisions of
this Section 6.8) (A) withdraw or adversely modify its approval or
recommendation of the Merger and recommend such Superior Proposal or (B)
terminate this Agreement, in each case, (i) at any time after five (5)
Business Days following IBKCs receipt of written notice (a "Notice of
Superior Proposal") advising IBKC that CMBCs board of directors has received
a Superior Proposal and enclosing a copy of the Acquisition Proposal,
identifying the Person submitting the Superior Proposal, specifying the
material terms and conditions of such Superior Proposal, and (ii) subject to
IBKCs Right of First Refusal (defined below). In the event IBKC elects not to
exercise the Right of First Refusal, CMBC shall provide IBKC with a final
written notice of acceptance before or simultaneous with accepting any
Superior Proposal. For purposes of this Agreement, "Superior Proposal" means
any unsolicited, _bona_ _fide_ , written Acquisition Proposal for
consideration consisting of cash and/or securities, and otherwise on terms
which CMBCs board of directors determines, after consultation with its
financial advisor, are more favorable to CMBCs shareholders (in their
capacities as shareholders) from a financial point of view than the

 



\- 19 -   Merger after giving effect to the provisions of Section 9.2 (or other
revised proposal submitted by IBKC). For the purposes of this Section 6.8(d),
an Acquisition Proposal shall be " _bona_ _fide_ " if the board of directors
of CMBC reasonably determines that the Person submitting such Acquisition
Proposal is capable, from a financial, regulatory and other appropriate
perspectives, of consummating such Acquisition Proposal on the terms
proposed.

(e) IBKC shall have the right ("Right of First Refusal") for five (5)
Business Days after receipt of Notice of Superior Proposal to make such
adjustments in the terms and conditions of this Agreement as would enable CMBC
to proceed with the Merger on the basis of such adjusted terms. If IBKC fails
to exercise such Right of First Refusal within the time herein specified,
CMBC shall be at liberty to accept the Superior Proposal, subject to the
obligations of CMBC pursuant to Section 9.2 hereof.

 

6.9 Agreement as to Efforts to Consummate. Subject to the terms and conditions
of this Agreement and its fiduciary duties under applicable law, each
Warrantor agrees to use, and to cause its Subsidiaries to use, its reasonable
efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions, and to do, or cause to be
done, all things, necessary, proper or advisable under applicable laws and
regulations to consummate and make effective, as soon as practicable after the
date of this Agreement, the transactions contemplated by this Agreement,
including, without limitation, using its reasonable efforts to lift or rescind
any injunction or restraining order or other order adversely affecting the
ability of any party hereto to consummate the transactions contemplated
hereby. Each Warrantor shall use, and shall cause each of its Subsidiaries to
use, its reasonable efforts to obtain consents of all third parties and
governmental bodies necessary or desirable for the consummation of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement. This Section 6.9 shall not
require either Warrantor to waive any condition to such Warrantors
obligation to consummate the Merger.

6.10 Operating Functions. CMBC and CSB shall cooperate with IBKC and
IBERIABANK in connection with planning for the efficient and orderly
combination of the parties and the operation of CSB after the Merger, and in
preparing for the consolidation of appropriate operating functions to be
effective on the Effective Date.

6.11 Preservation of Business. CMBC shall use its reasonable efforts to
preserve the possession and control of all of CMBCs and CSBs assets (other
than those consumed or disposed of for value in the ordinary course), and the
goodwill of customers and others having business relations with them, and will
do nothing knowingly to impair their ability keep and preserve their
businesses as they exist on the date hereof. From the date hereof until the
Effective Date, CSB (i) shall notify IBERIABANK prior to establishing the
rates to be paid by CSB on its deposit accounts if such rate change is not in
the ordinary course of business and consistent with CMBCs past practices as
disclosed on Schedule 6.12 hereof, (ii) shall confer with IBERIABANK not less
than once every two weeks to review the conduct of CMBCs loan approval
process, and (iii) shall notify IBERIABANK promptly of any change that may
reasonably be expected to result in a Material Adverse Effect on the Credits
identified in Section 5.8(a) of which it becomes aware.  

6.12 Issuance of IBKC Common Stock. IBKC shall, prior to the Closing, take
such action as is required to authorize and reserve for issuance the IBKC
Common Stock to the shareholders of CMBC pursuant to the Merger, and to permit
such IBKC Common Stock to be approved for listing and quotation on the NASDAQ
Global Select Market.

 

6.13 Support Agreements. CMBC shall use its reasonable efforts to deliver to
IBKC within five (5) days of the date hereof a Support Agreement executed by
each CMBC director substantially in the form of _Exhibit II_.

6.14 Agreement Regarding Certain Credits. Except in the case of fraud, no
deterioration or adverse change to any nonaccrual or substandard Credit that
was reviewed by IBKC or IBERIABANK during their due diligence examination of
CMBC prior to the date of this Agreement will result in any breach of a
representation, warranty, covenant or agreement hereunder or will constitute a
basis for the termination of this Agreement or a change to any of the terms
and conditions of this Agreement.

 

6.15 Bank Merger. CMBC will, and will cause CSB to, take such action as IBKC
shall reasonably deem necessary or advisable so that, on or as soon as
practicable after the Effective Date as determined by IBKC, CSB will merge
into IBERIABANK (the "Bank Merger").

Stock received (including any fractional share of IBKC Common Stock deemed to
be received and exchanged for cash) and the amount of cash received
(including any cash received in lieu of a fractional share of IBKC Common
Stock) over (b) the shareholders aggregate tax basis in the shares of CMBC
Common Stock exchanged in the Merger; and (2) the amount of cash received;

appear in any filing made in connection with the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement with any Regulatory Authority. In addition, each Warrantor
shall furnish to the other party for review a copy of each such filing made

assets remaining in any loan suspense account shall be allocated and
distributed to Plan participants (subject to the receipt of a
favorable determination letter from the Internal Revenue Service), as
provided for in the Plan and unless otherwise required by applicable law.
Prior to the Effective Date, CSB, and following the Effective Date,
IBERIABANK, shall use their respective best efforts in good faith to obtain
such favorable determination letter (including, but not limited to, making
such changes to the Plan and the proposed allocations as may be requested by
the Internal Revenue Service as a condition to its issuance of a favorable
determination letter). Prior to the Effective Date, CSB, and following the
Effective Date, IBERIABANK, will adopt such amendments to the Plan as may be
reasonably required by the Internal Revenue Service as a condition to granting
such favorable determination letter on termination. Following the effective
date of the Plans termination, neither CSB, prior to the Effective Date, nor
IBERIABANK, following the Effective Date, shall make any distribution from the
Plan except as may be required by applicable law until receipt of such
favorable determination letter. Any distributions may, at the recipients
option, be rolled into a defined contribution plan of IBERIABANK (or IBKC, as
the case may be), subject to IBKCs discretion: (i) to reject any such
rollover if it may reasonably jeopardize the qualified status of such
IBERIABANK or IBKC plan; and (ii) to reject non-cash rollovers or rollovers of
plan loans. In the case of a conflict between the terms of this Section 7.6

and IBERIABANK, after the Effective Date, shall use their best efforts to

IBKC substantially in the form of _Exhibit III_ (the "Post-Merger Employment
Agreement"). The Post-Merger Employment Agreement will provide
upon termination thereof substantially the same medical benefit coverage as
the Employees current Change of Control Agreement provides. The existing
employment agreement, if any, of the Employee with CMBC and the CSB
Subsidiaries listed on  _Schedule 7.7_ (the "Pre-Merger Employment
Agreement") shall be terminated as of the Effective Date and superseded by the
Post-Merger Employment Agreement. The Employee shall receive any payments that
he is entitled to receive under his existing Pre-Employment Agreement on the
Effective Date (and, as applicable, _Schedules 2.3(a), 2.3(b), 2.3(c) and/or
2.3(d)_ ); _provided, however_ , that no such payments or benefits in
connection with the Merger shall constitute an excess parachute payment under
Section 280G of the Code.

SECTION VIII.

 

CONDITIONS PRECEDENT TO OBLIGATIONS TO CONSUMMATE

The obligation of each Warrantor to consummate the Merger is subject to the
satisfaction of each of the following conditions, unless waived by such party
pursuant to Section 10.5 of this Agreement: 

8.1 Representations and Warranties. The representations and warranties of the
other Warrantor set forth or referred to in this Agreement shall be true and
correct as of the date of this Agreement and as of the time of the Closing
with the same effect as though all such representations and warranties had
been made on and as of the time of the Closing, except (i) for any such
representations and warranties made as of a specified date, which shall be
true and correct as of such date or (ii) as expressly contemplated or
permitted by this Agreement, in each case subject to the standard set
forth in Section 5.21 hereof.

8.2 Performance of Agreements and Covenants. Each and all of the agreements
and covenants of the other Warrantor to be performed and complied with
pursuant to this Agreement and the other agreements contemplated hereby prior
to the time of the Closing shall have been duly performed and complied with by
it in all material respects.

8.3 Certificates. Each Warrantor shall have delivered to the other Warrantor a
certificate, dated as of the time of the Closing and signed on its behalf by
its chief executive officer and its chief financial officer, to the effect
that the conditions of its obligations set forth in Section 8.1 and Section
8.2 of this Agreement with respect to it have been satisfied, all in such
reasonable detail as the other Warrantor shall reasonably request.

8.4 Shareholder Approval. The shareholders of CMBC shall have approved this
Agreement, the Merger and the consummation of the transactions contemplated
hereby, as and to the extent required by law and by the provisions of the
governing instruments of CMBC, and CMBC shall have furnished to IBKC
certified copies of resolutions duly adopted by its shareholders evidencing
the same. Holders of not more than 15% of the CMBC Common Stock shall have
exercised statutory rights of dissent and appraisal pursuant to the LBCL.

8.5 Consents and Approvals. All material approvals and authorizations
of, filings and registrations with, and notifications to, all Regulatory
Authorities required for consummation of the Merger and the Bank Merger shall
have been obtained or made and shall be in full force and effect and all
waiting periods required by law shall have expired. Any approval obtained
from any Regulatory Authority which is necessary to consummate the
transactions contemplated hereby shall not contain any material adverse non-
standard term or condition which in the reasonable judgment of the Board of
Directors of IBKC so materially and adversely affects the economic or business
assumptions of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement so as to render
inadvisable the consummation of the Merger and the Bank Merger. To the extent
that any lease, license, loan or financing agreement or other contract or
agreement to which Warrantor is a party requires the consent of or waiver from
the other party thereto as a result of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, such consent or waiver shall have been obtained, unless the
failure to obtain such consent or waiver would not, following the Merger, have
a Material Adverse Effect on such Warrantor.

 

8.6 Termination of Employment and COC Agreements. The COC Agreement with
CMBCs Chief Executive Officer shall have been terminated. In addition, no
more than two (2) of the other Employment and COC

 



\- 23 -   Agreements listed in _Schedule 2.3(a)_ and _Schedule 2.3(b),_ respectively,
that IBKC has designated in writing at least twenty (20) days prior to the
Effective Date to be terminated in accordance with this Agreement, shall not
have been terminated prior to the Effective Date.

8.7 Legal Proceedings. No Warrantor shall be subject to any order, decree or
injunction of a court or agency of competent jurisdiction which enjoins or
prohibits consummation of any of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement.

 

8.8 Tax Matters. Each Warrantor shall have received the tax opinion addressed
to it referred to in Section 7.2 of this Agreement. No payments or benefits
to officers of CMBC or its Subsidiaries in connection with the Merger shall
constitute an excess parachute payment under Section 280G of the Code (or, if
so, CMBC may satisfy this condition by reducing the Merger Consideration by
an amount equal to the additional income tax incurred by CMBC and its
Subsidiaries as a result of the disallowance of the deduction applicable
thereto).

 

8.9 Registration Statement. The Registration Statement shall be effective
under the 1933 Act, no stop order suspending the effectiveness of the
Registration Statement shall be in effect, and no proceeding for such purpose
shall be pending before or threatened by the SEC.

8.10 Simultaneous Transactions. The Warrantors shall have executed all
documents and taken all such other action as are necessary to effectuate the
Merger other than any post-Merger filings necessary to report and complete
the Merger, and the Warrantors shall have irrevocably authorized their agents
to make any such post-Merger filings in its behalf.

8.11 Legal Opinions. Each Warrantor shall have received an opinion from
counsel for the other Warrantor, dated as of the Effective Date, with respect
to such matters and in such form as shall be agreed upon between counsel for
each Warrantor.

8.12 NASDAQ Listing. The shares of IBKC common stock to be issued in the
Merger shall have been authorized for listing on the NASDAQ Global Select
Market.

8.13 Payment of Merger Consideration. As a condition to CMBCs obligation to
consummate the Merger, IBKC shall have delivered the Merger Consideration to
the Exchange Agent on or before the Closing Date and the Exchange Agent shall
provide CMBC with a certificate evidencing such delivery.

8.14 No Material Adverse Effect. Since December 31, 2010, no event has
occurred or circumstance arisen that, individually or in the aggregate, has
had a Material Adverse Effect on the other Warrantor.

 

SECTION IX.

TERMINATION

9.1 Termination. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement and
notwithstanding the approval of this Agreement by the shareholders of CMBC,
this Agreement may be terminated and the Merger abandoned at any time prior to
the Closing:

 

(a) By mutual consent of the Boards of Directors of the Warrantors; or

 

(b) By the Board of Directors of either Warrantor (provided that the
terminating party is not then in material breach of any representation,
warranty, covenant or other agreement contained in this Agreement) in the
event of a material breach by the other Warrantor of any representation,
warranty, covenant or agreement of such other Warrantor contained herein which
would result in the failure to satisfy the closing condition set forth in
Section 8.1 or 8.2 of this Agreement, which breach cannot be or has not been
cured within thirty (30) days after the giving of a written notice to the
breaching Warrantor of such material breach; or

(c) By the Board of Directors of either Warrantor in the event that the Merger
shall not have been consummated within twelve (12) months after the date of
this Agreement (unless the failure of the Closing to occur

 



\- 24 -   by such date shall be due to the failure of the party seeking to terminate
this Agreement to perform or observe the covenants and agreements of such
party set forth herein), and no consent to extend the date of the Closing
beyond such twelve (12) month period has been granted; or

(d) By the Board of Directors of either Warrantor in the event any approval
of any Regulatory Authority required for consummation of the Merger and the
other transactions contemplated hereby shall have been denied by final non-
appealable action of such Regulatory Authority or if any such action taken by
such Regulatory Authority is not appealed within the time limit for appeal; or

(e) By the Board of Directors of IBKC, in the event any such approval of any
Regulatory Authority required for consummation of the Merger and the other
transactions contemplated hereby is conditioned upon the satisfaction of any
material adverse condition or requirement that, in the reasonable opinion of
IBKC, would so materially adversely affect its business or the economic
benefits of the Merger as to render consummation of the Merger inadvisable or
unduly burdensome, and the time period for appeals and request for
reconsideration has run; or

(f) By the Board of Directors of either Warrantor, if the shareholders of
CMBC fail to approve this Agreement and the consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby at the Shareholders Meeting; or

 

(g) By the Board of Directors of either Warrantor (provided that the
terminating party is not then in material breach of any representation,
warranty, covenant or other agreement contained in this Agreement) in the
event that any of the conditions precedent to the obligations of such
Warrantor to consummate the Merger cannot be satisfied or fulfilled within
twelve (12) months after the date of this Agreement; or

(h) By the Board of Directors of IBKC if the Board of Directors of
CMBC shall, or shall have resolved to, withdraw, modify or change its
recommendation to CMBCs shareholders of this Agreement or the Merger, or
recommend any Acquisition Proposal other than the Merger; or

 

(i) By the Board of Directors of either Warrantor if the other Warrantor has
experienced a Material Adverse Effect, which is not remedied or cured within
thirty (30) days after notice of intention to terminate is given by the
Warrantor invoking this Section 9.1(i), which notice shall specify the nature
of the matter or matters constituting such Material Adverse Effect and which
are the basis of such intention; _provided, however_ , that the right to
terminate that is specified in such notice of intention shall itself terminate
unless notice of termination is given by such Warrantor within fifteen (15)
days following the end of such remedial or curative period; or

(j) By the Board of Directors of CMBC, pursuant to Section 6.8(d).

9.2 Effect of Termination.

 

(a) In the event of the termination and abandonment of this Agreement pursuant
to Section 9.1 of this Agreement, this Agreement shall become void and have
no effect and the parties hereto (and the Subsidiaries of the parties and the
officers and directors of the parties and their Subsidiaries) will be relieved
of all obligations and liabilities under this Agreement, except that: (i) the
provisions of Sections IX and X hereof shall survive any such termination and
abandonment; (ii) a termination pursuant to Section 9.1(b) of this Agreement
shall not relieve a breaching Warrantor from liability for any breach giving
rise to such termination and the provisions of Section 9.2(c) or (d), as
applicable; (iii) each Warrantor shall remain obligated under, and liable for
any breach of, any of the provisions of this Agreement that survive
its termination.

(b) In the event this Agreement is terminated by IBKC (i) pursuant to Section
9.1(b) hereof because of a willful breach of a representation, warranty,
covenant or other agreement by CMBC, or (ii) pursuant to Section 9.1(h) hereof
because the Board of Directors of CMBC shall have withdrawn, modified or
changed its recommendation to CMBCs shareholders other than in the exercise
of the CMBC Boards fiduciary obligations after delivery to IBKC of a notice
of intention to terminate pursuant to Section 9.1(i) which is not remedied or
cured by IBKC prior to the withdrawal, modification or change, or by CMBC
pursuant to Section 9.1(k) hereof, and within twelve (12) months after the
date of any such termination CMBC, without IBKCs prior written consent,
accepts in a written agreement an Acquisition Proposal, then CMBC shall pay
IBKC $6,000,000 (the "Termination Fee"), which

 



\- 25 -   shall be paid as follows: (a) $3,000,000 shall be paid not later than the
fifth Business Day following the date CMBC accepts such Acquisition Proposal,
and (b) $3,000,000 shall be paid on the earlier of the date of consummation
of such Acquisition Proposal or six (6) months from the date of acceptance of
the Acquisition Proposal. Upon payment of the Termination Fee pursuant to this
Section 9.2(b), IBKC will not have any other rights or claims against CMBC or
its Subsidiaries, or their respective officers and directors, under this
Agreement.

 

(c) In the event this Agreement is terminated by CMBC (i) pursuant to Section
9.1(b) hereof because of a willful breach of a representation, warranty,
covenant or other agreement by IBKC, or (ii) pursuant to Section 9.1(e)
hereof, then IBKC shall pay CMBC $4,000,000 (the "Termination Fee") not later
than the fifth Business Day following the date CMBC provides notice to IBKC
of its termination and the reasons for such termination. Upon payment of the
Termination Fee pursuant to this Section 9.2(c), CMBC will not have any other
rights or claims against IBKC or its Subsidiaries, or their respective
officers and directors, under this Agreement.

(d) In the event this Agreement is terminated as a result of IBKCs failure
to satisfy any of its representations, warranties or covenants set forth
herein, IBKC shall reimburse CMBC for its reasonable out-of-pocket expenses
relating to the Merger in an amount not to exceed $500,000;
_provided however_ , that this provision shall not apply in circumstances in
which IBKC is entitled to a Termination Fee. The expense reimbursement
provided for in this Section 9.2(d) shall be IBKCs sole and exclusive remedy
and shall be deemed to be liquidated damages.

(e) In the event this Agreement is terminated as a result of CMBCs failure to
satisfy any of its representations, warranties or covenants set forth herein,
CMBC shall reimburse IBKC for its reasonable out-of-pocket expenses relating
to the Merger in an amount not to exceed $500,000; _provided, however_ , that
this provision shall not apply in circumstances in which CMBC is entitled to
a Termination Fee. The expense reimbursement provided for in this Section
9.2(e) shall be CMBCs sole and exclusive remedy and shall be deemed to be
liquidated damages.

 

9.3 Survival of Representations, Warranties and Covenants. The respective
representations, warranties, obligations, covenants and agreements of the
Warrantors shall not survive the Effective Date, except for those covenants
and agreements contained in this Agreement which by their terms apply in whole
or in part after the Effective Date; _provided, however_ , that no such
representations, warranties or covenants shall be deemed to be terminated or
extinguished so as to deprive any Warrantor (or any director, officer or
controlling Person thereof) of any defense in law or equity which otherwise
would be available against the claims of any Person, the aforesaid
representations, warranties and covenants being material inducements to
consummation by the Warrantors of the transactions contemplated hereby.

\- 26 -  10.3 Entire Agreement. Except as otherwise expressly provided herein, this
Agreement, including the exhibits and schedules hereto, and the
Confidentiality Agreement contain the entire agreement among the parties
hereto with respect to the transactions contemplated hereunder and thereunder,

shall inure to the benefit of and be binding upon the parties hereto and their

contemplated hereby; _provided, however_ , that such modification shall not
change the amount, kind, manner or basis in which shares of CMBC Common Stock
