12  thereof and shall include reasonable detail regarding such specific
objections. If Buyer and Seller working in good faith are unable to agree on
such disputed items on or prior to the 90th day following the Closing Date,
then either Party may refer such dispute to Ernst and Young LLP or, if that

and binding determination as to all matters in dispute on a timely basis and
promptly shall notify the Parties in writing of its resolution. Such
Accounting Firm handling the dispute resolution shall act as an expert and
not as a moderator and shall not have the power to modify or amend any term or
provision of this Agreement. Each of Buyer and Seller shall bear and pay one-
half of the fees and other costs charged by such Accounting Firm. If Seller

amounts are so agreed or determined, by wire transfer of immediately available
funds to an account or accounts designated by Seller, the amount of such
difference or (ii) less than the Estimated Working Capital Adjustment as paid
by Buyer at Closing, then Seller and Buyer shall execute a joint instruction
to the Working Capital Escrow Agent to pay to Buyer, within five Business Days
after such amounts are agreed or determined, by wire transfer of immediately
available funds to an account designated by Buyer, the amount of such
difference.

2.7  _Earnout_. Subject to _Section 9.12_, Buyer will pay the Earnout
Amount, if any, in accordance with _Exhibit D_.

2.8 _Purchase Price Allocation_. __

(a) Seller and Buyer agree that the Base Purchase Price shall be allocated
among the Companies for Tax purposes in accordance with the allocation as
agreed by the Seller and Buyer prior to the Closing Date (the " _Base Purchase
Price Allocation_ "). 

(b) Within 30 days after the Net Working Capital is agreed or determined in
accordance with _Section 2.6_, Seller shall provide to Buyer a proposed
allocation (consistent with the Base Purchase Price Allocation) of the
Purchase Price among the Companies and a further allocation, to the extent
consistent with Treasury Regulation Sections 1.338-6, 1.755-1 and 1.1060-1,
of the Purchase Price among the Assets of the Companies (the " _Purchase Price
Allocation Schedule_ "). Within 30 days after its receipt of Sellers proposed
Purchase Price Allocation Schedule, Buyer shall propose to Seller any changes
thereto or otherwise shall be deemed to have agreed thereto. In the event that
Buyer proposes changes to Sellers proposed Purchase Price Allocation Schedule
within the 30 day period described above, Seller shall, in good faith,
consider any comments so received from Buyer and shall furnish Buyer with a
revised Purchase Price Allocation Schedule as soon as practicable. If after
receipt of the revised Purchase Price Allocation Schedule, Buyer disagrees
with the allocation of the Purchase Price among the Assets of the Companies
set forth therein, then the Accounting Firm shall determine such allocation.
The cost of such Accounting Firm shall be borne equally by Seller and Buyer.

 



13 (c) The Purchase Price Allocation Schedule shall be revised to take into
account subsequent adjustments to the Purchase Price, including any
indemnification payments (which shall be treated for Tax purposes as
adjustments to the Purchase Price), in accordance with the provisions of
Section 1060 of the Code and the Treasury Regulations thereunder. Each of
Seller and Buyer agree to file all applicable Tax Returns and otherwise report
their affairs for Tax purposes consistent with the Purchase Price Allocation
Schedule, as agreed to by Buyer and Seller or as determined by the Accounting
Firm, except as otherwise required by applicable Laws.

Assets of the Companies), shall be deemed a failure to satisfy the conditions
specified in _Article VI_ or _Article VII_.

5.2 _Access of Buyer_.

(a) During the Interim Period, Seller will provide Buyer and its
Representatives with reasonable access, upon reasonable prior notice and
during normal business hours, to the Assets of the Companies and the officers
and employees of Seller and its Affiliates who have significant responsibility
for the Assets of the Companies, but only to the extent that such access (i)
does not unreasonably interfere with the business of Seller or its Affiliates
or the safe commercial operations of the Assets of the Companies and (ii) is
reasonably related to Buyers obligations and rights hereunder;  _provided,
however_ , that (A) Seller shall have the right

 



28  to have a Representative present for any communication with employees or
officers of Seller or its Affiliates and (B) Buyer shall and shall cause its
Representatives to observe and comply with all health, safety and security
requirements of each of the Companies. Buyer shall hold in confidence all such
information on the terms and subject to the conditions contained in the
Confidentiality Agreement, provided, however, if the Confidentiality
Agreement was executed by an Affiliate of Buyer, then Buyer hereby agrees to
be bound by and to comply with the terms and conditions of such
Confidentiality Agreement.

 

(b) Buyer understands that Seller has had discussions with its management and
employees regarding the sales process and strategy, including preparation and
negotiation of this Agreement, the Schedules hereto and the other documents
contemplated herein, and that Buyer shall not have access to any information
surrounding such discussions, including any internal drafts of
this Agreement, information regarding any other bids for the Companies or the
bid process as a whole and Buyer hereby agrees that it shall not have any
rights to any such information and shall not request any of the Companies,
their management or their employees to provide to it any such information,
and further agrees that if it is provided or encounters any such information,
that it will not use it in any disputes with Seller.

 

(c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this _Section 5.2_, Buyer
shall have no right of access to, and neither Seller nor any of its
Affiliates shall have any obligation to provide any information the disclosure
of which (1) could reasonably be expected to jeopardize any privilege
available to Seller or its Affiliates, (2) would cause Seller or
its Affiliates to breach a confidentiality obligation, or (3) would result in
a violation of Law.

(d) Buyer agrees to indemnify and hold harmless Seller, its Affiliates and
their respective Representatives for any and all liabilities, losses, costs or
expenses incurred by Seller, its Affiliates or their respective
Representatives arising out of the access rights under this _Section 5.2_,
including any Claims by any of Buyers Representatives for any injuries or
property damage while present on the Real Property.

5.3 _Certain Restrictions_. Except as required or permitted hereby, or as
consented to by Buyer (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed), or as otherwise set forth in _Schedule 5.3_, during
the Interim Period, Seller will cause the Companies to operate in the ordinary
course of business. Without limiting the foregoing, except as otherwise
required or permitted hereby or required by the terms of any permit or any
Material Contract or as consented to by Buyer, which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed (except that none of this
_Section 5.3_ shall apply to Contracts for which neither a Company nor
any of the Assets of the Companies will be bound or have liability after
Closing, or services terminated pursuant to _Section 5.5_), Seller will cause
the Companies not to undertake any of the following without the consent of
Buyer (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or
delayed):

(a) create any Lien (other than a Permitted Lien) against any of the Assets
of the Companies;

(b) grant any material waiver of any material term under, or give any
material consent with respect to, any Material Contract other than in the
ordinary course of business;

 



29 (c) sell, transfer, convey or otherwise dispose of any material Assets of the
Companies other than the sale of inventory in the ordinary course of
business;

(d) except as may be required to meet the requirements of applicable Law or
GAAP, change any accounting method or practice in a manner that is
inconsistent with past practice in a way that would materially and adversely
affect the Business or a Company;

 

(e) fail to maintain its limited liability company, partnership or corporate
existence, as applicable, or consolidate with any other Person or acquire all
or substantially all of the Assets of any other Person;

(f) issue or sell any Equity Interests in a Company;

(g) liquidate, dissolve, recapitalize, reorganize or otherwise wind up its
business or operations;

 

(h) purchase any securities of any Person, except for short-term investments
made in the ordinary course of business;

 

(i) enter into, terminate or materially amend any Contract involving total
consideration throughout its term in excess of $500,000 (other than any
Contract (i) that will be performed prior to Closing, (ii) is described on
_Schedule 5.3_ , or (iii) is entered into, terminated or amended in the
ordinary course of business);

 

(j) make or change any material election in respect of Taxes, adopt or change
any accounting method in respect of Taxes, file any amendment to a federal,
state or foreign income Tax Return or any other material Tax Return, enter
into any Tax sharing or similar agreement or closing agreement, settle any
Claim or assessment in respect of Taxes, consent to any extension or
waiver of the limitation period applicable to any claim or assessment in
respect of Taxes, or enter into intercompany transactions giving rise to
deferred gain or loss of any kind;

(k) amend or materially modify its Charter Documents in a manner that would
have a material adverse effect on the ability of Seller to consummate the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement; or 

(l) agree or commit to do any of the foregoing.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, Seller may permit the Companies to take
commercially reasonable actions with respect to (i) emergency situations or
(ii) regulatory requirements and/or other requirements of Law and Seller
shall, upon receipt of notice of any such actions, promptly inform Buyer of
any such actions taken outside the ordinary course of business.

5.4 _Employee and Benefit Matters_.

(a) To the extent that any obligations under the Worker Adjustment and
Retraining Notification Act, 29 U.S.C. Section 2101 _et seq_., the regulations
and rules thereunder, or under any similar provision of any federal, state,
foreign or local law, rule or regulation (collectively, a " _WARN Obligation_
") arise with respect to any loss of employment by any

 



30  employee of any Company, whether on or after Closing, as a result of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, or as a result of any decision or
event after the Closing, Buyer shall be solely responsible for such WARN
Obligation.

(b) During the period from the date of this Agreement to the Closing
Date, except as otherwise permitted under this Agreement, the Companies will
not enter into any additional Contracts with employees, directors or
consultants of the Companies that will create any obligation to Buyer or the
Companies after the Closing Date, or make or agree to make any material
changes to any existing Contracts or agreements with employees, directors or
consultants of the Companies without Buyers prior written consent; _provided_
, _however_ , that the foregoing shall not prohibit increases in compensation
to employees in the ordinary course of business consistent with past
practices.

 

5.5 _Resignation and Removal_. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to
the contrary, at or prior to the Closing, Seller may (though it need not do
so, except as provided in _Section 2.4(c)_) cause or accept the resignation
or removal of any manager, partner, officer and/or director, as applicable,
nominated or appointed by Seller or its Affiliates to any board or operating,
management or other committee relating to the Assets of the Companies
established under the Companies Charter Documents.

Affiliate, on the other hand, to be paid in full or otherwise released; and

 

(d) Seller shall have the right to cause the Companies to pay Cash dividends,
and/or make Cash distributions to Seller or its Affiliates at any time prior
to the close of business on the Business Day immediately preceding the Closing
Date.

5.7 _Tax Matters._

(a) With respect to any Tax Return that is required to be filed by a Company
after the Closing Date with respect to a Pre-Closing Period, Seller shall
prepare or cause to be prepared such Tax Return. With respect to any Tax
Return that is required to be filed by a Company after the Closing Date with
respect to a Straddle Period, Buyer shall prepare or cause to be prepared
such Tax Return. Not later than 30 days prior to the due date (including
extensions) of each Tax Return for a Pre-Closing Period or for a Straddle
Period, the Party responsible for preparing such Tax Return shall deliver a
copy of such Tax Return to the other Party for its review and reasonable
comment. The Party responsible for preparing such Tax Return shall

 



31  consider in good faith any such comments received from the other Party not
less than 15 days prior to the due date (including extensions) for filing such
Tax Return and shall deliver a final copy of such Tax Return to such other
Party not less than ten days prior to such due date. Buyer shall cause each
such Tax Return to be timely filed and shall timely pay the Taxes shown due
thereon. Such Tax Returns shall be prepared on a basis consistent with past
practice except to the extent otherwise required by applicable Laws. For the
avoidance of doubt, Seller shall have sole responsibility for any
consolidated, combined or unitary Tax Returns that Seller (or one of its
Affiliates other than a Company) is obligated to file and that include any of
the Companies for a taxable period that includes the Closing Date, and such
Tax Returns shall not be subject to the procedures described in this _Section
5.7_.

 

(b) In the case of Taxes of any Company with respect to any Straddle Period,
the portion of any such Tax that is attributable to the portion of the period
ending on the Closing Date shall be:

(i) in the case of Taxes that are either (A) based upon or related to income,
sales, revenue, production, receipts or similar items, or other Taxes not
described in _Section 5.7(b)(ii)_ or _Section 5.7(b)(iii)_ or (B) imposed in
connection with any sale or other transfer or assignment of property (real or
personal, tangible or intangible), deemed equal to the amount that would be
payable if the taxable years of the Companies ended with (and included) the
Closing Date; _provided_ that exemptions, allowances or deductions that are
calculated on an annual basis (including depreciation and amortization
deductions) shall be allocated between the period ending on and including the
Closing Date and the period beginning after the Closing Date in proportion to
the number of days in each period;

(ii) in the case of any liability for any real property, personal property,
ad valorem and similar Taxes and Taxes that are otherwise imposed on a
periodic basis with respect to the assets of any of the Companies, deemed to
be the amount of such Taxes for the entire Straddle Period (or, in the case
of such Taxes determined on an arrears basis, the amount of such Taxes for
the immediately preceding period), multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of
which is the number of calendar days in the portion of the period ending on
the Closing Date and the denominator of which is the number of calendar days
in the entire period; and

(iii) For purposes of the Texas franchise Tax, (A) the entire amount of the
Texas franchise Tax imposed on the Companies for any privilege period
beginning before January 1, 2012, whether based on taxable capital, earned
surplus, or taxable margin, and (B) for the privilege period beginning on or
after January 1, 2012, the amount that would be owed if the Companies filed,
as a combined group, a final franchise tax report in accordance with Section
171.0011 of the Texas franchise Tax that is based on the business activity of
the Companies computed on the period beginning on the day after the last day
for which a Texas franchise Tax was computed on a previous report under
Chapter 171 of the Texas franchise Tax that included the Companies and ending
on the Closing Date.

(c) After Closing, Buyer shall grant or cause the Companies to grant to Seller
(or its designees) access at all reasonable times to all of the records
relating to the Companies (and to the employees of the Companies for
explanation thereof), and shall afford Seller (or its

 



32  designees) the right (at Sellers expense) to take extracts therefrom and to
make copies thereof, to the extent reasonably necessary to permit Seller (or
its designees) to prepare Tax Returns, respond to Tax audits and
investigations, prosecute Tax protests, appeals and refund Claims and to
conduct negotiations with Taxing Authorities.

(d) Unless required by applicable Laws, no amended Tax Return with respect to
a Pre-Closing Period or Straddle Period shall be filed by or on behalf of any
Company without the prior written consent of Seller if such amended Tax
Return would increase the obligations of Seller pursuant to _Article IX_ or
decrease the amount owed to Seller pursuant to _Section 5.7(e)_.

 

(e) The amount of any refunds of Taxes of the Companies for any Pre-Closing
Period shall be for the account of Seller. The amount of any refunds of Taxes
of the Companies for any Tax period beginning after the Closing Date shall be
for the account of Buyer. The amount of any refund of Taxes of the Companies
for any Straddle Period shall be equitably apportioned between Buyer
and Seller in accordance with the principles set forth in _Section 5.7(b)_.
Each Party shall forward, and shall cause its Affiliates to forward, to the
Party entitled to receive a refund of Tax pursuant to this _Section 5.7(e)_
the amount of such refund within 30 days after such refund is received, net
any costs or expenses incurred by such Party or its Affiliates in procuring
such refund.

5.8 _Public Announcements_. The Parties will consult with each other prior to
issuing any publication or press release of any nature with respect to this
Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby and shall not make or
issue, or cause to be made or issued, any such publication or press release
prior to such consultation and without the prior written consent of the other
Party (which consent will not be unreasonably withheld or delayed) except to
the extent, but only to such extent, that, in the opinion of the Party issuing
such publication or press release, such announcement or statement may be
required by Law, any listing agreement with any securities exchange or any
securities exchange regulation, in which case the Party proposing to issue
such publication or press release shall use its reasonable efforts to consult
in good faith with the other Party before issuing any such publication or
press release and shall reasonably cooperate with the other Party in good
faith with respect to the timing, manner and content of disclosure.

5.9 _Updating_. From time to time prior to the Closing, Seller may at its
option supplement or amend and deliver updates to the Schedules to complete or
correct any information in such Schedules or in any representation or
warranty in _Article III_ with regard to events, circumstances or matters that
arose or occurred after the date of this Agreement. Any such update made
pursuant to this _Section 5.9_ shall be deemed to cure any inaccuracy of any
representation or warranty made in this Agreement, provided that any such
update shall be disregarded for purposes of the conditions to closing set
forth in _Article VI_. Notwithstanding the foregoing, for purposes of the
indemnity obligations of Seller in this Agreement, the Schedules shall be
deemed to include all information contained in any supplement, amendment or
update thereto.

 

5.10 _Escrow Funds_. __ The Buyer is entitled to all or a portion of the
Working Capital Escrowed Cash to the extent of any obligations of the Seller
under _Section 2.6_ and the Indemnity Escrowed Cash to the extent of any
obligations of the Seller under _Section 9.2_. To the extent 

 



33  funds are due to Buyer, Buyer and Seller shall jointly instruct the Working
Capital Escrow Agent and the Indemnity Escrow Agent, respectively, to release
such funds to Buyer that are specified with reasonable detail by the Seller.
In the event there is a dispute regarding the amount of funds to be released
from the Working Capital Escrow Account or the Indemnity Escrow Account, only
that portion of the funds in dispute shall be held back and not released
until resolution of the dispute. If any Indemnity Escrowed Cash (or interest
thereon) remains in the Indemnity Escrow Account on April 15, 2012 and there
is no indemnity Claim of the Buyer then still unresolved (or otherwise once
all such Claims are resolved), the Parties shall execute and deliver to the
Indemnity Escrow Agent joint written instructions promptly to deliver all such
amounts by wire transfer of immediately available funds to Seller. If any
Working Capital Escrowed Cash (or interest thereon) remains in the Working
Capital Escrow Account on the date that such Working Capital Adjustment is
resolved and there is no Working Capital Adjustment payable to Buyer, the
Parties shall execute and deliver to the Working Capital Escrow Agent joint
written instructions promptly to deliver all such amounts by wire transfer of
immediately available funds to Seller.

5.11 _Further Assurances_. __ Subject to the terms and conditions of this
Agreement, at any time or from time to time after the Closing, at either
Partys request and without further consideration, the other Party shall (and
in the case of Buyer, Buyer shall and shall cause the applicable Companies to)
execute and deliver to such Party such other instruments of sale, transfer,
conveyance, assignment and confirmation, provide such materials and
information and take such other actions as such Party may reasonably request
in order to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. The
Parties agree that they will use their respective commercially reasonable
efforts to cause the Working Capital Escrow Agent and the Indemnity Escrow
Agent, respectively, to return at the Closing a duly executed counterpart
executed by each such Escrow Agent to the Working Capital Escrow Agreement and
Indemnity Escrow Agreement, as applicable.

this Agreement and shall not be eligible for indemnification under this
_Article IX_.

(b) Buyer and Seller shall be entitled to be indemnified pursuant to

which was not fully paid from the Indemnity Escrow Cash.

(e) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement,

recovers amounts from a third party (including an insurer) with respect to a
Claim for which Buyer or the Company have already received an indemnification
payment (either from the Indemnity Escrow Account or by set off against the
Earnout Amount), then Buyer or such Company, as applicable, will promptly (i)
return to the Indemnity Escrow Account the amount it received from it with
respect to such Claim if the Base Survival Period has not expired at such
time, (ii) credit to the Earnout Amount the amount set off with respect to
such Claim if the

to the Seller the remaining amount it received or set off against Buyers
obligation to pay the Earnout Amount with respect to such Claim.

indemnification is available under this _Article IX_ , any references or
qualifications in the underlying representation, warranty, covenant, or
agreement with respect to materiality (including Material Adverse Effect)
shall be disregarded.

 

9.5 _Claims Procedures_.

is likely to give rise to a Claim or Proceeding by a third party or of facts
causing any indemnified Person to believe it has a Claim for breach hereunder
(an " _Asserted Liability_ "), such indemnified Person shall give prompt
written notice thereof (the " _Claims Notice_ ") to the relevant indemnifying
Person, provided that in any event, such indemnified Person shall give the
Claims Notice to the indemnifying Person no later than the later of (i) 30
days after becoming aware of such Asserted Liability or (ii) 10 days after the
filing of the next Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q or Annual Report on Form 10-K
of Kirby Corporation that is filed after Buyer becomes aware of such Asserted
Liability. The Claims Notice shall describe the Asserted Liability in
reasonable detail, and shall indicate the amount (estimated, if necessary) of
the Loss that has been or may be suffered. The indemnified Person and the
indemnifying Person agree to keep each other reasonably appraised of any
additional information concerning any Asserted Liability.

(b) As to an Asserted Liability arising from a third party action, the
indemnifying Person shall be, subject to the limitations set forth in this
_Section 9.5_, entitled to assume control of and appoint lead counsel for
such defense; _provided, however_ , that the indemnifying Person shall not
have the right to assume control of the defense of any Asserted Liability (i)
to the extent that the object of such Asserted Liability is to obtain an
injunction, restraining order, declaratory relief or other non-monetary
relief against the indemnified Person which, if successful, would materially
adversely affect the Business, operations, Assets, or financial condition of
the indemnified Person, or (ii) if the named parties to any such action or
proceeding (including any impleaded parties) include both indemnified Persons
and the indemnifying Person and the former shall have been advised in writing
by counsel (with a copy to the indemnifying Person) that there are one or
more legal or equitable defenses available to them that are different from or
additional to those available to indemnifying Persons; _provided, further,
however_ , that to exercise such rights the indemnifying Person must give
notice to the indemnified Person within 90 days after receipt of any such
Claims Notice whether it is assuming control of and appointing lead counsel
for such defense. If the indemnifying Person does not give such notice within
such 90-day period, then the indemnified Person shall have the right to
assume control of the defense thereof at the cost and expense of the
indemnifying Person, subject to the limitations of liability and other limits
set forth in _Section 9.3(a)_.

 

(c) If the indemnifying Person shall assume the control of the defense of the
Asserted Liability in accordance with the provisions of this _Section 9.5_,
(i) the indemnifying

 



39  Person shall obtain the prior written consent of the indemnified Person
(which shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed) before
entering into any settlement, compromise, admission or acknowledgement of the
validity of such Asserted Liability if the settlement does not unconditionally
release the indemnified Person and, if applicable, any of the affected
Companies, from all liabilities and obligations with respect to such Asserted
Liability or the settlement imposes any non-monetary, injunctive or other
equitable relief against the indemnified Person or, if applicable, any Company
and (ii) the indemnified Person shall be entitled to participate, at its
own cost and expense, in the defense of such Asserted Liability and to employ
separate counsel of its choice for such purpose.

 

(d) If the indemnified Person shall assume the control of the defense of any
Asserted Liability in accordance with the provisions of this  _Section 9.5_,
(i) the indemnified Person shall obtain the prior written consent of the
indemnifying Person (which shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or
delayed) before entering into any settlement, compromise, admission or
acknowledgement of the validity of such Asserted Liability and (ii) the
indemnifying Person shall be entitled to participate, at its cost and expense,
in the defense of such Asserted Liability and to employ separate counsel of
its choice for such purpose.

(e) Each Party shall cooperate, and cause their respective Affiliates to
cooperate, in the defense or prosecution of any Asserted Liability arising
from a third party action and shall furnish or cause to be furnished such
records, information and testimony (subject to any applicable confidentiality
agreement), and attend such conferences, discovery proceedings, hearings,
trials or appeals as may be reasonably requested in connection therewith.

9.6 _Waiver of Other Representations_.

(a) NOTWITHSTANDING ANYTHING IN THIS AGREEMENT TO THE CONTRARY, IT IS THE
EXPLICIT INTENT OF EACH PARTY, AND THE PARTIES HEREBY AGREE, THAT NONE OF
SELLER NOR ANY OF ITS AFFILIATES OR THEIR RESPECTIVE REPRESENTATIVES HAS MADE

OTHER PARTYS OR ANY OF ITS AFFILIATES SOLE, JOINT OR CONCURRENT NEGLIGENCE,
STRICT LIABILITY OR OTHER FAULT, (" _NON-REIMBURSABLE DAMAGES_ ")  _PROVIDED
HOWEVER_ , THAT THE TERM "NON-REIMBURSABLE DAMAGES" SHALL NOT INCLUDE, AND
THIS _SECTION 9.7(b)_ SHALL NOT LIMIT AN INDEMNIFIED PERSONS RIGHT TO

such partys expense) to take extracts therefrom and to make copies thereof,
to the extent reasonably necessary to implement the provisions of, or to

is necessary in order to have records available with respect to Tax matters),
or if any of the records pertain to any Claim or Dispute pending on the
seventh anniversary of the Closing Date, Buyer shall maintain any of the
records designated by Seller or its Representatives until such Claim or

9.9 _Dispute Resolution and Arbitration_.

(a) In the event of any dispute, controversy or Claim among the Parties, or
any of them, arising out of or relating to this Agreement, or the breach or
invalidity thereof (collectively, a " _Dispute_ "), the Parties shall attempt
in the first instance to resolve such Dispute through friendly consultations
between senior management of the Parties. The Parties agree to attempt to
resolve all Disputes arising hereunder promptly, equitably and in a good
faith manner.

 



41  The Parties further agree to provide each other with reasonable access
during normal business hours to any and all non-privileged records,
information and data pertaining to such Dispute, upon reasonable advance
notice.

(b) If such consultations do not result in a resolution of the Dispute within
30 Business Days after written notice by a Party to the other Parties
describing the Dispute and requesting friendly consultation, then the Dispute
may be submitted by any Party to binding arbitration pursuant to the terms of
this _Section 9.9_, irrespective of the magnitude thereof, the amount in
dispute or whether such Dispute would otherwise be considered justifiable or
ripe for resolution by any court or arbitral tribunal, by giving written
notice thereof to the other Parties; provided, however, that in no event
shall a Party have the right to submit the Dispute to arbitration if the
institution of legal or equitable proceedings based on such Dispute would be
barred by any applicable statute of limitations or  _Section 9.1_.

(c) Any Dispute shall be settled exclusively and finally by binding
arbitration in accordance with the provisions of this _Section 9.9_.

9.10 _Arbitration Procedures_.

 

(a) Any Party electing to arbitrate a Dispute shall designate its nomination
for an arbitrator in its notice to the other Party electing to submit the
Dispute to arbitration. Each Party receiving such notice shall, within 10
Business Days thereafter, by return written notice to all Parties, state
whether it will accept such nomination, or decline to accept it and designate
its nomination for an arbitrator. One arbitrator shall control the
proceedings if such nomination of an arbitrator is accepted by all Parties or
if the receiving Party fails to nominate an arbitrator within the required 10
Business Day period. If the receiving Party timely nominates an arbitrator,
the arbitral tribunal shall consist of three arbitrators, with one arbitrator
being selected by Seller and one arbitrator being selected by Buyer, within
five Business Days after the expiration of the 10 Business Day period
reference above, and the two selected arbitrators choosing a third arbitrator,
which third arbitrator must be a Person with the requisite knowledge and
experience to make a fair and informed determination with respect to
the matter in dispute, which Person shall not be an Affiliate of any Party,
nor an employee, director, officer, shareholder, owner, partner, agent or a
contractor of any Party or of any Affiliate of any Party, either presently or
at any time during the previous two years. In the event the arbitrators fail
to appoint the third arbitrator within 30 days after they have accepted their
appointment, the third arbitrator (meeting the qualifications specified in the
preceding sentence) shall be appointed by the Houston office of the American
Arbitration Association. The arbitration shall be conducted in accordance with
the Commercial Arbitration Rules of the American Arbitration Association, as
supplemented to the extent necessary to determine any procedural appeal
questions by the Federal Arbitration Act (Title 9 of the United Stated Code).
If there is an inconsistency between this _Section 9.10_ and the Commercial
Arbitration Rules or the Federal Arbitration Act, the provisions of this
_Section 9.10_ shall prevail.

(b) Within 10 Business Days after the selection of the arbitrator(s), each
Party shall submit to the arbitrator(s) such Partys proposal for resolution
of the Dispute, which such proposal shall not conflict with the terms and
conditions of this Agreement, together with the supporting data, if any, that
was used to determine such proposal. Within 30 days after the

 



42  proposals are submitted, the arbitrator(s) shall hold a hearing during which
the Parties may present evidence in support of their respective proposals. The
arbitrator(s) (by majority rule if there are three arbitrators) will
determine the outcome of the Dispute. The cost of the arbitration shall be
split between the Parties equally and each Party shall pay for one half of the
costs.

 

(c) The place of arbitration shall be Houston, Texas, unless in any particular
case the Parties agree upon a different venue.

 

(d) The arbitrator(s) shall have no right or authority to grant or award Non-
Reimbursable Damages.

 

(e) Any decision of the arbitrator(s) pursuant to this _Section 9.10_ shall
be final and binding upon the Parties. The Parties agree that the arbitral
award may be enforced against the Parties to the arbitration proceeding or
their Assets wherever they may be found and that a judgment upon the arbitral
award may be entered in any court having competent jurisdiction thereof. The
Parties expressly submit to the jurisdiction of any such court. The Parties
hereby waive, to the extent permitted by Law, any rights to appeal or to
review of such award by any court or tribunal.

 

(f) When any Dispute occurs and is the subject of friendly consultations or
arbitration, the Parties shall continue to make payments of undisputed
amounts in accordance with this Agreement, and the Parties shall otherwise
continue to exercise their rights and fulfill their respective obligations
under this Agreement. While any friendly consultations or arbitration is
pending, no Party shall exercise any other remedies hereunder arising by
virtue of the matters in Dispute.

9.11 _Determination of Amount of Damages; Mitigation_. The Losses giving rise
to any indemnification obligation hereunder shall be limited to the actual
loss suffered by the indemnified Person and shall be reduced by any insurance
proceeds or other payment or monetary recoupment actually received by the
indemnified Person as a result of the events giving rise to the claim for
indemnification. Any indemnified Person that becomes aware of Losses for which
it intends to seek indemnification hereunder shall use commercially
reasonable efforts to collect any amounts to which it may be entitled under
insurance policies or from third parties (pursuant to indemnification
agreements or otherwise) and shall use commercially reasonable efforts to
mitigate such Losses, provided that in the event that Buyer is the
indemnified Person, Buyer shall promptly notify Seller of any efforts to
mitigate. Notwithstanding the foregoing, neither the Buyer nor any Company
shall be required to pursue any claims against any customer of any Company or
against any employees of any Company; _provided_ , _however_ , that, to the
extent neither Buyer nor the Company choose to pursue any such claim, Seller
shall have full rights of substitution and subrogation to pursue any such
claims against such customers and/or employees with the same rights as if they
were Buyer and Buyer shall (and shall cause the Companies to) execute powers
of attorney, assignments or such other documents as reasonably requested to
permit Seller to exercise such rights.

9.12 _Set Off._ In addition to any right that a Buyer Indemnified Party may
have to seek payment for amounts owed to it under this _Article IX_ from the
Indemnity Escrow Account, Buyer may, to the extent provided in this Agreement,
set off any amount to which it or any Buyer Indemnified Party may be entitled
under this _Article IX_ against the Earnout Amount otherwise payable to Seller
under this Agreement.

consents to the assignment of the Acquired Interests by the Assignor to the

Earnout Provisions

Section 1\. _Earnout_. Upon the terms and subject to the conditions of this
_Section 1_, Buyer shall deliver to Seller the dollar amount (if any) that
becomes payable in accordance with the provisions of this _Section 1_.

 

(a) _Quarterly Financial Statements_. Within 45 days following the end of each
of the first three calendar quarters during each year of the Earnout Period,
Buyer shall (i) prepare (or cause to be prepared) an unaudited statement of
income for the Company for such calendar quarter in accordance with this
Agreement and GAAP (except for notes and subject to normal year-end audit
adjustments, and including (x) a calculation of EBITDA and (y) a description
of (1) any acquisition made by Buyer or any of its Affiliates of assets or
companies that are in the same business as the Business or (2)
any Divestiture made by the Company) (" _Quarterly Financial Statements_ ")
and (ii) deliver the Quarterly Financial Statements to Seller. The Quarterly
Financial Statements shall be provided for information purposes only
and shall not prevent any Party from taking a contrary position with respect
to the information contained therein.

(b)  _Delivery of Earnout Statement_. Within 30 days following receipt by the
Company of its annual audit for each year during the Earnout Period, Buyer
shall deliver a copy to Seller of an Earnout Statement.

 

(c) _Review_. Following the delivery of an Earnout Statement to Seller, Buyer
and the Company shall afford Seller and its Representatives the opportunity
to examine the Earnout Statement and such supporting schedules, analyses,
workpapers, including any audit workpapers, and other underlying records or
documentation as are reasonably necessary and appropriate. Buyer and the
Company shall cooperate fully and promptly with Seller and its Representatives
in such examination, including providing answers to questions asked by Seller
and its Representatives, and Buyer and the Company shall promptly make
available to Seller and its Representatives any records under their control
that are reasonably requested by Seller and its Representatives and are
relevant to the Earnout Statement.

(d) _Dispute_. If within 60 days following receipt of an Earnout Statement,
Seller has not delivered to Buyer written notice (the " _Objection Notice_ ")
objecting to the Earnout Statement and specifying in reasonable detail the
basis for the objection, then that Earnout Statement shall be deemed final and
binding on the parties. If Seller delivers the Objection Notice in accordance
with the preceding sentence, then Buyer and Seller shall endeavor in good
faith to resolve the objections, for a period not to exceed 30 days following
delivery of the Objection Notice. If at the end of such 30-day period there
are any objections that remain in dispute with respect to the Earnout
Statement, then the items in the Objection Notice that remain in dispute (the
" _Disputed Items_ ") may be submitted by either Party for resolution to the
Accounting Firm pursuant to the procedures set forth in Section 2.6(b) of
this Agreement, except as expressly provided in this Section 1(d). If any
Disputed Items are

 



1  submitted to the Accounting Firm for resolution, each Party shall furnish to

accountants) and will be afforded the opportunity to present to the Accounting
Firm any material relating to the determination of the matters in dispute and

Firm determines all such Disputed Items, the Accounting Firm shall calculate
EBITDA by taking into account all components of such calculation not disputed
by the Parties, the Accounting Firms determination with respect to each
Disputed Item and the terms of this Agreement. The Accounting Firm shall make
its calculation of EBITDA in accordance with this Agreement and shall set
forth such calculation in reasonable detail in a written notice and deliver
such notice to both Parties, and such calculation shall (except in the case of
fraud or manifest error) be binding and conclusive on the Parties and
constitute final, binding and unappealable determination, on the basis of
which, in the case of the Final Earnout Statement, a judgment may be entered
by a court having jurisdiction thereof and shall constitute the final and
binding Earnout Statement for the relevant period for all purposes under this
Agreement.

(e) _Expenses_. Buyer and Seller shall each bear their own fees and expenses
in connection with any proceeding under this _Section 1(e)_; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that Buyer and Seller shall each be responsible for payment of 50%
of the fees and expenses of the Accounting Firm with respect to such
proceeding.

 

(f) _Calculation and Payment of Earnout Amount_. When the Final Earnout
Statement becomes final and binding in accordance with  _Section 1(d)_,

within ten Business Days after the date that the Final Earnout Statement
becomes final and binding in accordance with _Section 1(d)_ (the " _Earnout
Payment Date_ "), by wire transfer of immediately available funds pursuant to
wire transfer instructions provided by Seller in writing.

[**CONFIDENTIAL TREATMENT REQUESTED PURSUANT TO RULE 24b-2 OF THE SECURITIES
EXCHANGE ACT OF 1934**] 

(g) _Payment of Amounts Not in Dispute_. Notwithstanding anything in this
Agreement to the contrary, if an Objection Notice has been delivered pursuant
to _Section 1(d)_ with respect to the Final Earnout Statement, the portion of
the Earnout Amount (if any) that is not in dispute shall be paid within five
Business Days after the date that the Objection Notice is delivered.

(h) _Interest_. All payments pursuant to this _Section 1_ shall be without
interest for any periods during the Earnout Period but shall accrue interest
until paid at the Past Due Rate from and after the date which is the earlier

discussion shall be done in such a manner so as not to unreasonably interfere
with the normal conduct of Buyers or the Companys business;

 

(ii) cause the Company to remain in material compliance with all applicable
Laws;

 

(iii) operate the business and maintain adequate records of the Company in a
manner that will allow EBITDA to be calculated on a stand alone basis

(iv) refer (or cause to be referred) to the Company all new projects and
contracts of Buyer and its Subsidiaries that relate to the Business as
conducted by the Companies on the Closing Date;

 

(v) not divert or direct to any of Buyers other Affiliates customer projects,
sales or orders that relate to the Business as conducted by the Companies on
the Closing Date;

 



3 (vi) not change the Companys fiscal year or accounting policies until its

regarding the future earnings or prospects of the Company, except to the
extent included in or covered by the representations, warranties and covenants

(m) _Future Business Divestitures_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
in this Agreement, any Divestiture by Buyer on or after the Closing Date,
whether by merger, stock purchase, asset purchase or otherwise, shall be
factored into EBITDA for all periods after such Divestiture using a pro-rated
annual credit equal to 10.94% of the aggregate sales price, or in the event
of an inter-Company Divestiture, the fair market value thereof.

(n) _Contractual Relationship_. The earnout is strictly a contractual
