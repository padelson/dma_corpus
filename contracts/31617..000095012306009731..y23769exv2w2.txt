<PAGE>

     Escrow Agreement;

          (iv) the Buyer and each of the persons identified in Section
     1.3(b)(iv) of the Sellers' Disclosure Letter (collectively, the "Key

          (v) each of the Sellers (other than the ESOP) shall execute and
     deliver to the Buyer a release in the form of Exhibit D attached hereto
     (the "Sellers' Release").

     Section 1.4 Purchase Price Adjustment.

     (a) Closing of the Books on the Closing Date. In preparation for the
Closing, the Sellers shall use their commercially reasonable efforts to cause a
full balance sheet closing to take place at 11:59 p.m. on the day immediately
preceding the Closing Date as if it were the last day of a fiscal period for the
Company.

     (b) Inventory Count. Prior to the Closing, the Sellers shall take or cause
to be taken a physical count of the quantities of inventory of the Company as at
11:59 p.m. on the day immediately preceding the Closing Date (the "Inventory
Count"). The Inventory Count shall be conducted in a manner that is consistent
with the method historically used by the Company to conduct a full physical
count of its inventory as conducted during the Company's year-end book closing
process. Representatives of the Buyer may observe the Inventory Count being
taken, and the Sellers agree to consult with the Buyer in the preparation of the
Inventory Count procedures and instructions. The Inventory Count shall be
completed on such day as the parties shall determine, but in any event not later
than two (2) Business Days before the Closing Date.

     (c) Estimated Closing Statement. Immediately prior to the Closing, the
Sellers shall prepare or cause to be prepared and shall deliver to the Buyer a
statement (the "Estimated Closing Statement") consisting of (i) an estimated
consolidated balance sheet of the Company as of the Closing Date (the "Estimated
Closing Balance Sheet") and (ii) an estimated calculation in reasonable detail
of the Closing Book Value derived from the Estimated Closing Balance Sheet (the
"Estimated Closing Book Value"). The Estimated Closing Statement shall be
prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles
("GAAP"), applied in a manner consistent with the application of GAAP in the
preparation of the audited balance sheet included in the Audited Financial
Statements as at and for the period ended December 31, 2005, except as set forth
in


                                        3

<PAGE>

Section 1.4 of the Buyer Disclosure Letter. All items that constitute Sellers'
Expenses shall be reflected either as a reduction in cash or as a liability on
the Estimated Closing Balance Sheet, and the quantities and value of the
Company's inventory shall be reflected on the Estimated Closing Balance Sheet in
accordance with the results of the Inventory Count.

     (d) Holdback. At the Closing, the Buyer shall have the right to withhold
from the Cash Consideration an amount equal to the Holdback Amount, subject to
the provisions of Section 1.4(j).

     (e) Closing Statement. Within 30 days following the Closing Date, the
Sellers shall prepare or cause to be prepared and delivered to the Buyer a
statement (the "Closing Statement") consisting of (i) a consolidated balance
sheet of the Company as of the Closing Date (but without giving effect to the
Closing) (the "Closing Balance Sheet"), (ii) a calculation in reasonable detail
of the Closing Book Value derived from the Closing Balance Sheet and (iii) a
calculation of the amount, if any, payable under clause (j) of this Section 1.4.
The Closing Statement shall be prepared in accordance with GAAP, applied in a
manner consistent with the application of GAAP in the preparation of the audited
balance sheet included in the Audited Financial Statements as at and for the
period ended December 31, 2005, except as set forth in Section 1.4 of the Buyer
Disclosure Letter. All items constituting Sellers' Expenses shall be reflected
either as a reduction in cash or as a liability on the Closing Balance Sheet,
and the quantities and value of the Company's inventory shall be reflected on
the Closing Balance Sheet in accordance with the results of the Inventory Count.

     (f) Dispute Notice. The Closing Statement shall become final, binding and
conclusive upon the Sellers and the Buyer on the 30th day following the Buyer's
receipt of the Closing Statement, unless prior to such 30th day the Buyer
delivers to the Sellers a written notice (a "Dispute Notice") stating the
Buyer's objections to the Closing Statement and specifying in reasonable detail
each item disputed by the Buyer (a "Disputed Item") and the basis of the Buyer's
objection to such Disputed Item.

     (g) Resolution Period. If the Buyer delivers to the Sellers a Dispute
Notice, then the Buyer and the Sellers shall seek in good faith to resolve the
Disputed Items during the 15-day period beginning on the date the Sellers
receive the Dispute Notice (the "Resolution Period"). If the Buyer and the
Sellers reach agreement with respect to any Disputed Items, the Sellers shall
cause the Closing Statement to be revised to reflect such agreement.

     (h) Independent Accountant. If the Buyer and the Sellers are unable to
resolve all of the Disputed Items during the Resolution Period, then the Buyer
and the Sellers shall jointly engage and submit the unresolved Disputed Items
(the "Unresolved Items") for resolution to BDO Seidman, LLP, or if BDO Seidman,
LLP is unavailable, to another nationally recognized independent registered
public accounting firm, appointed by


                                        4

<PAGE>

mutual agreement of the Buyer and the Sellers, that has not had a material
relationship with the Company, any of the Sellers or the Buyer within the
preceding two years (the "Independent Accountant"). If the Buyer and the Sellers
fail to appoint an Independent Accountant within ten days after the end of the
Resolution Period, they shall request the American Arbitration Association to
appoint as the Independent Accountant a nationally recognized independent
registered public accounting firm that has not had a material relationship with
the Company, any of the Sellers or the Buyer within the preceding two years, and
such appointment shall be final, binding and conclusive on the Buyer and the
Sellers. The Buyer and the Sellers shall use their commercially reasonable
efforts to cause the Independent Accountant to issue its written determination
regarding the Unresolved Items within 30 days after such items are submitted for
review. The Independent Accountant shall make a determination with respect to
the Unresolved Items only and in a manner consistent with this Section 1.4, and
in no event shall the Independent Accountant's determination of the Unresolved
Items be for an amount that is outside the range of the Buyer's and the Sellers'
disagreement. The engagement letter of the Independent Accountant shall specify
the procedures to be followed, consistent with this Section 1.4, by the
Independent Accountant in determining Unresolved Items. Each party shall use its
commercially reasonable efforts to furnish to the Independent Accountant such
work papers and other documents and information pertaining to the Unresolved
Items as the Independent Accountant may request. The determination of the
Independent Accountant shall be final, binding and conclusive on the Buyer and
the Sellers absent manifest error, and the Sellers shall cause the Closing
Statement to be revised to reflect such determination upon receipt thereof. The
fees, expenses and costs of the Independent Accountant shall be borne equally by
the Buyer and the Sellers.

     (i) Access to Information. Each party shall use its commercially reasonable
efforts to provide promptly to the other party all information and reasonable
access to employees as such other party shall reasonably request in connection
with review of the Estimated Closing Statement, the Closing Statement or the
Dispute Notice, as the case may be, including all work papers of the accountants
who audited, compiled or reviewed such statements or notices, and shall
otherwise cooperate in good faith with such other party to arrive at a final
determination of the Closing Statement.

     (j) Purchase Price Adjustment. Within thirty (30) days after the Closing
Statement is finalized pursuant to paragraphs (f), (g) or (h) of this Section
1.4:

          (i) if the Closing Book Value exceeds the Baseline Book Value, the
     Buyer shall pay (x) to the Sellers, pro rata in accordance with their
     respective Allocation Percentages, the amount of such excess and (y) to the
     Sellers (other than the ESOP), pro rata in accordance with their respective
     Individual Allocation Percentages, the Holdback Amount;

          (ii) if the Closing Book Value is less than the Baseline Book Value
     and the amount of such shortfall is equal to or less than the Holdback
     Amount, the

     Buyer shall pay to the Sellers (other than the ESOP), pro rata in
     accordance with their respective Individual Allocation Percentages, an
     amount equal to (x) the Holdback Amount less (y) the amount of such
     shortfall; or

          (iii) if the Closing Book Value is less than the Baseline Book Value
     and the amount of such shortfall exceeds the Holdback Amount (the amount of
     such excess, the "PPA Excess Amount"), at the Buyer's option, either (A) an
     amount equal to the PPA Excess Amount shall be offset against the principal
     balance of the Promissory Note, in accordance with the procedures set forth
     therein, or (B) the Buyer and the Sellers (other than the ESOP) shall
     jointly instruct the Escrow Agent to release from the Escrow and pay to the
     Buyer an amount equal to the PPA Excess Amount; provided, however, that in
     the event that the PPA Excess Amount is greater than $500,000, the Buyer
     may, at its option, require that all or any portion of the PPA Excess
     Amount be paid to the Buyer in cash by the Sellers (other than the ESOP),
     pro rata in accordance with their respective Individual Allocation
     Percentages.

     (k) Method of Payment, Interest, etc. Any amount paid in respect of any
adjustments to the Purchase Price made pursuant this Section 1.4 shall be (i)
increased by simple interest on such amount at an interest rate equal to the
rate on U.S. Treasury Bills with a maturity of three months, as reported by The
Wall Street Journal on the Closing Date, from and after the Closing Date to and
including the date of payment, (ii) made by wire transfer of immediately
available funds to an account designated by the receiving party and (iii)
treated as an adjustment to the Purchase Price for tax purposes to the extent
permitted by applicable Law.

     (l) Indemnification Not Affected. The Buyer's rights to indemnification
pursuant to Section 8.2 shall not be deemed to limit, supersede or otherwise
affect, or be limited, superseded or otherwise affected by, the Buyer's rights
under this Section 1.4, except to the extent any Loss is expressly taken into
account in the finalized Closing Statement.

to the extent applicable, (i) all plan documents, trust agreements, insurance
contracts or other funding arrangements, (ii) the two most recent Forms 5500

modifications to any such Company Benefit Plan or related document. The Company
has not communicated to any current or former employee thereof any intention or
commitment to amend or modify any Company Benefit Plan or to establish or
implement any other employee or retiree benefit or compensation plan or
arrangement.

     (b) Qualification. Except as set forth in Section 2.17(b) of the Sellers'
Disclosure Letter, when applicable, each Company Benefit Plan intended to be
qualified under section 401(a) of the Code, and the trust (if any) forming a
part thereof, is so qualified in form and as administered. The ESOP and has
received a favorable determination letter from the IRS, and the IRS has issued a
favorable determination letter approving the form of the Company's prototype
401(k) plan, and no event has occurred since the respective


                                       26

<PAGE>

dates of such determination letters that could adversely affect the qualified
status of the ESOP or the 401(k) plan. All amendments and actions required to
bring each Company Benefit Plan into conformity with the applicable provisions
of ERISA, the Code, and other applicable Law have been made or taken, except to
the extent such amendments or actions are not required by law to be made or

the meaning of section 4975(e)(7) of the Code.

     (d) Liability; Compliance.

          (i) Neither the Company nor any Company Related Person has been
     involved in any transaction that could cause the Company or, following the
     Closing Date, the Buyer or any of their respective Affiliates to be subject
     to liability under section 4069 or 4212 of ERISA. Neither the Company nor
     any Company Related Person has incurred (either directly or indirectly,
     including as a result of an indemnification obligation) any liability under
     or pursuant to Title I or IV of ERISA or the penalty, excise Tax or joint
     and several liability provisions of the Code relating to employee benefit
     plans, and no event, transaction or condition has occurred or exists that
     could result in any such liability to the Company, any Company Related
     Person or, following the Closing Date, the Buyer or any of its Affiliates.
     Except as set forth in Section 2.17(d)(i) of the Sellers' Disclosure
     Letter, all contributions and premiums required to have been paid by the
     Company or any Company Related Person to any Company Benefit Plan under the
     terms of any such plan or its related trust, insurance contract or other
     funding arrangement, or pursuant to any applicable Law (including ERISA and
     the Code) or collective bargaining agreement have been paid within the time
     prescribed by any such plan, agreement or applicable Law. For purposes of
     this section, the term "Company Related Person" means the Company and any
     person or entity that would be or, over the past six years, would have been
     treated as a single employer with the Company for purposes of Section
     414(b), (c), (m) or (o) of the Code.

          (ii) There are no pending or, to the Knowledge of the Sellers,
     threatened claims by or on behalf of any participant in any of the Company
     Benefit Plans, or otherwise involving any such Company Benefit Plan or the
     assets of any Company Benefit Plan that individually or in the aggregate
     would not reasonably be expected to be materially adverse to the Company.
     Except as set forth in Section 2.17(d)(ii) of the Sellers' Disclosure
     Letter, the Company Benefit Plans are not presently under audit or
     examination (nor has notice been received of a potential audit or
     examination) by the IRS, the Department of Labor, or any other


                                       27

<PAGE>

     Governmental Authority, domestic or foreign, and no matters are pending
     with respect to a Company Benefit Plan under the IRS's Voluntary Compliance
     Resolution program, its Closing Agreement Program, or other similar
     programs.

          (iii) No Company Benefit Plan is a defined benefit plan (as defined in
     section 3(35) of ERISA), a multiemployer plan (as defined in section
     4001(a)(3) of ERISA) or a "multiple employer plan" within the meaning of
     section 4063 or 4064 of ERISA. The Company does not have any withdrawal
     liability in respect of any such plan.

          (iv) The Company does not have any liability in respect of any
     post-retirement health, medical or life insurance benefits for retired,
     former or current employees of the Company, except as required to avoid
     excise tax under section 4980B of the Code.

     (e) Section 280G. The execution, delivery, and performance of this
Agreement or any of the Ancillary Agreements and the consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby and thereby will not (alone or in combination
with any other event) result in an increase in the amount of compensation or
benefits or the acceleration of the vesting or timing of payment of any
compensation or benefits payable to or in respect of any current or former
employee, officer, director or independent contractor of the Company or any
increased or accelerated funding obligation with respect to any Company Benefit
Plan. No payment or deemed payment by the Company will arise or be made as a
result (alone or in combination with any other event) of the execution, delivery
and performance of this Agreement or any of the Ancillary Agreements, or the
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby, that would not
be deductible pursuant to section 4999 of the Code.

     Section 2.18 Tax Matters. Except as set forth on Section 2.18 of the
Sellers' Disclosure Letter:

          (a) Filing and Payment. All Tax Returns required to be filed with
     respect to the Company have been duly and timely filed and are complete and
     correct in all material respects. Section 2.18(a) of the Sellers'
     Disclosure Letter lists all of the states, territories and jurisdictions in
     which such income, franchise, sales or use Tax Return with respect to the
     Company were filed for the calendar years beginning after December 31,
     2000, and complete copies of all such Tax Returns have been made available
     to the Buyer. All Taxes (whether or not reflected on such Tax Returns)
     required to be paid with respect to, or that could give rise to a Lien on
     the Assets of, the Company have been duly and timely paid. All Taxes
     required to be withheld by the Company have been duly and timely withheld,
     and such withheld Taxes have been either duly and timely paid to the proper
     Governmental Authority or properly set aside in accounts for such purpose.


                                       28

<PAGE>

          (b) Financial Records. All accounting entries (including but not
     limited to, charges and accruals) for current Taxes with respect to the
     Company reflected on the books of the Company are adequate to cover any
     current Tax liabilities accruing through the end of the last period for
     which the Company ordinarily records items on its books. Since the end of
     the last period for which the Company ordinarily records items on its
     books, the Company has not engaged in any transaction, or taken any other
     action, other than in the Ordinary Course of Business, that would
     reasonably be expected to result in a materially increased current Tax
     liability. All accounting entries for deferred Tax liabilities with respect
     to the Company accurately reflect the differences between the treatment of
     items for accounting and income Tax purposes. All necessary valuations
     allowances have been properly recorded. Since December 31, 2005, the
     Company has not engaged in any transaction, or taken any other action,
     other than in the Ordinary Course of Business, that would reasonably be
     expected to result in a materially increased deferred Tax liability or a
     materially decreased deferred Tax asset.

          (c) Procedure and Compliance. No written agreement or other document
     waiving or extending or, to the Knowledge of the Sellers, having the effect
     of waiving or extending, the statute of limitations or the period of
     assessment or collection of any Taxes with respect to the Company, and no
     written power of attorney with respect to any such Taxes has been filed or
     entered into with any Governmental Authority (except for the power of
     attorney filed in connection with the ESOP's determination letter
     application with the IRS). The time for filing any Tax Return with respect
     to the Company has not been extended to a date later than the date of this
     Agreement. No Taxes with respect to the Company are currently under audit,
     examination or investigation by any Governmental Authority. No Governmental
     Authority has asserted or, to the Knowledge of the Sellers, threatened to
     assert any deficiency, claim or issue with respect to Taxes or any
     adjustment to Taxes against the Company with respect to any taxable period
     for which the period of assessment or collection remains open. No
     adjustment that would materially increase any current or deferred Tax
     liability or materially reduce any Tax asset of the Company has been made
     or, to the Knowledge of the Sellers, proposed or threatened by any
     Governmental Authority during any audit of any taxable period which would
     reasonably be expected to be made, proposed or threatened in an audit of
     any subsequent taxable period. No material elections for Tax purposes
     (including any entity classification elections) have been made with respect
     to the Company that are currently in force or by which the Company is
     bound. The Company has never been an "S corporation" within the meaning of
     section 1361 of the Code.

          (d) Tax Sharing, Consolidation and Similar Arrangements. The Company
     (i) has not received or applied for a Tax ruling or entered into a closing


                                       29

     provision or any similar provision of state or local law), in either case
     that would be binding upon the Company after the Closing Date, (ii) is or
     has been a member of any affiliated, consolidated, combined or unitary
     group for purposes of filing Tax Returns or paying Taxes or (iii) has any
     liability for the Taxes of any person (whether under Treasury Regulation
     Section 1.1502-6 or any similar provision of state, local or foreign law,
     as a transferee or successor, pursuant to any tax sharing or indemnity
     agreement or other contractual agreements, or otherwise).

          (e) Certain Transactions. Except as set forth in Section 2.18(e) of
     the Sellers' Disclosure Letter, the Company will not be required to include
     any item of income in, or exclude any item of deduction from, taxable
     income for any taxable period (or portion thereof) ending after the Closing
     Date, as a result of (i) any change in method of accounting for a taxable
     period ending on or prior to the Closing Date under Section 481 of the Code
     (or any corresponding provision of state, local or foreign income Tax law);
     (ii) installment sale or open transaction disposition made on or prior to
     the Closing Date; or (iii) prepaid amount received on or prior to the

     outstanding.

     insurance coverage) (A) have been in effect continuously since January 1 of
     the third calendar year preceding the Balance Sheet Date and remain in full

     premium increase with respect to, or alteration of coverage under, any of
     such policies.

     (c) Section 2.19(c) of the Sellers' Disclosure Letter describes:

          (i) any self-insurance arrangement by or affecting the Company,
     including any reserves established thereunder; and

          (ii) all obligations of the Company to third parties with respect to
     insurance (including such obligations under leases and service agreements)
     and identifies the policy under which such coverage is provided.

     Section 2.20 Accounts Receivable. All accounts receivable of the Company
that are reflected on the Balance Sheet or on the Closing Balance Sheet

claim or right of set-off, other than returns in the Ordinary Course of
Business, under any agreement or arrangement with any obligor of an Accounts
Receivable relating to the amount or validity of such Accounts Receivable.

realizable value on the Balance Sheet or the Closing Balance Sheet, as the case

representation, warranty, indemnification, closing condition or agreement given

the termination of such individual's employment with the Company or the Buyer,
or (iv) induce or attempt to induce any customer, supplier, licensee, or
business relation of the Company or the Buyer to cease doing, or decrease,

                                   TAX MATTERS

     Section 5.1 Sellers' Responsibility for Taxes. Notwithstanding anything in
this Agreement to the contrary, the Sellers (other than the ESOP), jointly and
severally, shall bear and pay, reimburse, indemnify and hold harmless Buyer
Indemnitees for, from and against any and all Losses with respect to Taxes where
such Taxes (a) are in respect of any Pre-Closing Tax Period, but only to the
extent such Taxes exceed the "accrued taxes payable" set forth on the Closing
Statement as finally determined, (b) arise under


                                       44

<PAGE>

Treasury Regulation Section 1.1502-6 or any similar provision of U.S. state,
local or foreign Law or under principles of transferee or successor liability or
by contract, or (c) arise from, or are attributable to, any inaccuracy in, or
breach of, any representation or warranty made in Section 2.18, in each of the
above cases, together with any reasonable out-of-pocket fees and expenses
(including attorney's and accountant's fees) incurred in connection therewith.

     Section 5.2 Straddle Periods. For purposes of Section 5.1, any liability
for Taxes attributable to a taxable period that begins before and ends after the
Closing Date (a "Straddle Period") shall be apportioned between the portion of
such period ending on the Closing Date and the portion beginning on the day
after the Closing Date (a) in the case of real and personal property Taxes, by
apportioning such Taxes on a per diem basis and (b) in the case of income Taxes
and all other Taxes, on the basis of a closing of the books as of the end of the
Closing Date.

     Section 5.3 Tax Returns. The Sellers (other than the ESOP) shall be
responsible for preparing and filing all Tax Returns with respect to the Company
for all Pre-Closing Tax Periods other than Tax Returns in respect of any
Straddle Period. The Buyer shall be responsible for preparing and filing all
Straddle Period Tax Returns. Each of the Sellers and the Buyer shall use
commercially reasonable efforts to make any Tax Returns and work papers in
respect of a Pre-Closing Tax Period for which such party is responsible for
preparing available for review by the other party sufficiently in advance of the
due date for filing such Tax Returns, provided that the Sellers shall furnish
any such Tax Return that is an Income Tax Return to the Buyer for review not
later than sixty (60) days prior to the due date for filing such Income Tax
Return. In the event of any disagreement between the Buyer and the Sellers
regarding Tax Returns, such disagreement shall be resolved by BDO Seidman, LLP
(the "Tax Accountant"), and any such determination by the Tax Accountant shall
be final. The fees and expenses of the Tax Accountant shall be borne equally by
the Buyer on one hand and the Sellers on the other hand. If the Tax Accountant
does not resolve any differences between the Sellers and the Buyer with respect
to such Tax Return at least five (5) days prior to the due date therefor, such
Tax Return shall be filed as prepared by the party having the responsibility
hereunder for preparing such Tax Return and shall be amended by such party to
reflect the Tax Accountant's resolution. The preparation and filing of any Tax
Return that does not relate to a Pre-Closing Tax Period shall be exclusively
within the control of the Buyer. Except in connection with an audit resolved
pursuant to Section 5.4, the Sellers shall not amend any Tax Returns for any
Pre-Closing Tax Period without the written consent of the Buyer.

     Section 5.4 Tax Contests. Any party (other than the ESOP) that receives any
notice of a pending or threatened Tax audit, assessment or adjustment relating
to the Company, or to any Affiliate of the Company that may give rise to a
liability for the Company, or to any Seller as a result of holding Company stock
shall promptly notify the

other party within ten (10) Business Days of receipt of such notice. The parties
each agree to consult with and to keep the other parties hereto informed on a
regular basis regarding the status of any Tax audit or proceedings to the extent
that such audit or proceeding could affect a liability of such other parties
(including indemnity obligations). The Sellers shall have the right to control
at their expense the portion of any such audit, examination or proceeding that
relates to any Taxes for which the Sellers are responsible, provided that the
Sellers shall not settle or compromise any such audit, examination or proceeding
without the consent of the Buyer and provided further that the Buyer may
participate in any such audit, examination or proceeding, at its own expense.
The Buyer shall control any audit, examination or proceeding (or portion
thereof) that does not relate to Taxes for which the Sellers are responsible
under Section 5.1.

(other than the ESOP) shall (and shall cause their respective Affiliates,
Related Persons and representatives to) (a) provide the other party with such
assistance as may be reasonably requested in connection with the preparation and
filing of any Tax Return or any audit or other examination by any taxing
authority or judicial or administrative proceeding relating to Taxes and (b)
retain (and provide the other party and its agents and representatives with
reasonable access to) all records or information which may be relevant to such
Tax Return, audit, examination or proceeding, provided that the foregoing shall
be done in a manner so as not to interfere unreasonably with the conduct of the
business of the parties.

     Section 5.6 Transfer Taxes. All transfer, documentary, sales, use, stamp,
registration, value added and other such Taxes and fees (including any penalties
and interest) incurred in connection with transactions contemplated by this
Agreement (including any real property transfer tax and any similar Tax) shall
be paid by the Sellers when due, and the Sellers will, at their own expense, and
to the extent permitted under applicable Law, file all necessary Tax returns and
other documentation with respect to all such Taxes and fees, and, if required by
applicable law, the Buyer will, and will cause any member of the EDO Group to,
join in the execution of any such Tax returns and other documentation.

     Section 5.7 Overlap. To the extent that an obligation or responsibility
pursuant to Article VIII may overlap with an obligation or responsibility
pursuant to this Article V, the provisions of this Article V shall govern such
obligation or responsibility.

     Section 7.1 Termination. This Agreement may be terminated at any time prior
to the Closing Date:

          (a) by the written agreement of the Buyer and the Sellers;

          (b) by either the Buyer or the Sellers by written notice to the other
     party, if:

               (i) the Closing shall not have been consummated on or before
          November 26, 2006 (the "End Date"); provided, however, that the right
          to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this Section 7.1(b)(i) shall
          not be available to any party whose breach of any provision of this
          Agreement results in the failure of the Closing to be consummated by
          such time; or

               (ii) (A) there shall be any Law that makes consummation of the
          transactions contemplated by this Agreement illegal or otherwise


                                       49

<PAGE>

          prohibited or (B) any Order enjoining the Buyer or any of the Sellers
          from consummating the transactions contemplated by this Agreement is
          entered and such judgment, injunction, judgment or order shall have
          become final and nonappealable;

          (c) by the Buyer by written notice to the Sellers, if a material
     breach of any representation or warranty or failure to perform any covenant
     or agreement on the part of the Sellers or the Company set forth in this
     Agreement shall have occurred that would cause the conditions set forth in
     Section 6.1 or Section 6.2 not to be satisfied, and such breach is
     incapable of being cured by the End Date;

          (d) by the Buyer by written notice to the Sellers, if a Material
     Adverse Effect on the Company shall have occurred; or

          (e) by the Sellers by notice to the Buyer, if a material breach of any
     representation or warranty or failure to perform any covenant or agreement
     on the part of the Buyer set forth in this Agreement shall have occurred
     that would cause the conditions set forth in Section 6.1 or Section 6.3 not
     to be satisfied, and such breach is incapable of being cured by the End
     Date.

     Section 7.2 Effect of Termination.

     (a) If this Agreement is terminated pursuant to Section 7.1, this Agreement
shall become void and of no effect without liability of any party (or any of its
Affiliates, Related Persons, directors, officers, trustees, employees,
stockholders, agents, representatives or advisors) to the other party hereto,
except as set forth in Section 7.2(b).

     (b) A termination fee in the amount of $6,300,000 (the "Termination Fee")
shall be payable by one party (the "Breaching Party") to the other party (the
"Non-Breaching Party") in the event that (i) this Agreement is terminated by the
Breaching Party other than as expressly permitted in Section 7.1 or (ii) the
Breaching Party willfully takes or omits to take any action that results in a
breach of a representation or warranty of the Breaching Party set forth in this
Agreement or failure by the Breaching Party to perform any of its covenants
under this Agreement, in each case, if such breach or failure (A) gives the
Non-Breaching Party the right to terminate this Agreement under Section 7.1(c)
or (e) and (B) this Agreement is terminated by the Non-Breaching Party pursuant
thereto. The Termination Fee shall also be payable by the Sellers (other than
the ESOP) to the Buyer in the event this Agreement is terminated by either the
Buyer or the Sellers pursuant to Section 7.1(a) or (b) as a result of the
failure of the condition set forth in Section 6.4 to be satisfied. The
Termination Fee shall be payable within five (5) Business Days following the
date of such termination. The parties agree that the Termination Fee shall
constitute liquidated damages and shall be the Non-Breaching Party's sole and
exclusive remedy against the Breaching Party for any losses or damages suffered
by the Non-Breaching Party by reason of such termination or the breach giving


                                       50

<PAGE>

rise to such termination and the resulting failure to consummate the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement. The parties agree that the amount
of the Termination Fee is a reasonable estimate of such potential damages and
that the actual amount of such damages would be difficult to determine.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the ESOP shall not be required to pay any portion
of the Termination Fee set forth in this Section 7.2(b). For the avoidance of
doubt, no Termination Fee will be payable by any party if the Closing occurs.

     (c) The provisions of this Section 7.2 and Sections 4.4(b), 9.1, 9.2, 10.1,
10.4 and 10.6 shall survive any termination of this Agreement.

                                  ARTICLE VIII
                                 INDEMNIFICATION

     Section 8.1 Survival. The representations and warranties of the parties
contained in this Agreement, the Ancillary Agreements or in any certificate or
other writing delivered pursuant hereto or in connection herewith shall survive
for a period of eighteen (18) months following the Closing Date; provided,
however, that (a) the representations and warranties set forth in Sections 2.1,
2.2, 2.3, 2.9(a), 2.23 and 2.25 shall survive indefinitely or until the latest
date permitted by law and (b) the representations and warranties set forth in
Sections 2.14, 2.15, 2.16, 2.17 and 2.18 shall survive for the duration of the
applicable statute of limitations (including waivers) plus sixty (60) days. The
covenants and agreements of the parties contained in this Agreement or in any
certificate or other writing delivered pursuant hereto or in connection herewith
shall survive the Closing for the period explicitly specified therein or, if no
such period is specified therein, indefinitely. Notwithstanding the preceding
sentences, any breach of representation, warranty, covenant or agreement in
respect of which indemnity may be sought under this Agreement shall survive the
time at which it would otherwise terminate pursuant to the preceding sentences,
if notice of the inaccuracy or breach thereof giving rise to such right of
indemnity shall have been given to the party against whom such indemnity may be
sought prior to such time. Such notice shall set forth with reasonable
specificity the nature of the breach alleged.

     Section 8.2 Indemnification by Sellers. The Sellers (other than the ESOP)
shall, jointly and severally, defend, indemnify and hold harmless the Buyer, any
member of the EDO Group and the Company, and their respective officers,
directors, employees, agents, advisers and representatives (collectively, the
"Buyer Indemnitees"), from and against, and pay or reimburse the Buyer
Indemnitees for, any and all damage, loss, liability and expense (including
reasonable expenses of investigation, enforcement and collection and reasonable
attorneys' and accountants' fees and expenses in connection with any action,
suit or proceeding whether involving a third party claim or a claim solely
between the parties hereto) (collectively, "Losses"), resulting from, arising
out of or relating to:

          (a) any inaccuracy in or breach of any representation or warranty


                                       51

<PAGE>

     when made by the Sellers in or pursuant to this Agreement or any of the
     Ancillary Agreements;

          (b) any failure of any of the Sellers (or, prior to the Closing, the
     Company) to perform any covenant or agreement under this Agreement or any
     of the Ancillary Agreements;

          (c) any Sellers' Expenses that were not properly reflected on the
     Closing Balance Sheet in accordance with Section 1.4(e); or

          (d) any of the matters described in Item (a) of Section 2.17(b) of the
     Sellers' Disclosure Letter or Item (a) of Section 2.17(d)(i) of the
     Sellers' Disclosure Letter (regardless of whether or not the Loss exceeds
     any estimated damages or costs set forth in such items of the Sellers'
     Disclosure Letter).

     Section 8.3 Indemnification by Buyer. The Buyer shall defend, indemnify and
hold harmless the Sellers and their respective Related Persons, directors,
officers, trustees, employees, agents, advisers and representatives
(collectively, the "Seller Indemnitees") from and against, and pay or reimburse
the Seller Indemnitees for, any and all Losses resulting from, arising out of or
relating to:

          (a) any inaccuracy in or breach of any representation or warranty made
     by the Buyer in or pursuant to this Agreement or any of the Ancillary
     Agreements; or

          (b) any failure of the Buyer to perform any covenant or agreement
     under this Agreement or any of the Ancillary Agreements.

     Section 8.4 Certain Limitations, etc.

     (a) Except as set forth in Section 8.4(e), the Sellers' indemnification
obligations under this Article VIII shall be subject to the following
limitations: (i) the Sellers shall not be required to indemnify Buyer
Indemnitees for Losses under clause (a) or (b) of Section 8.2 until the
aggregate amount of all such Losses exceeds $500,000 (the "Threshold Amount"),
in which event the Sellers shall be responsible only for Losses in excess of
$250,000 (the "Deductible"), (ii) except with respect to any inaccuracies in or
breaches of the representations and warranties contained in Sections 2.1, 2.2,
2.3 and 2.18, the aggregate liability of the Sellers for Losses under clause
(a), (b) or (d) of Section 8.2 shall not exceed $25,000,000 (the "Cap") and
(iii) in no event shall the aggregate liability of any individual Seller for
Losses under Section 8.2 exceed an amount equal to the portion of the Purchase
Price allocated to such Seller in accordance with the Allocation Percentages.


                                       52

<PAGE>

     (b) Except (x) as set forth in Section 8.4(e) and (y) with respect to any
inaccuracies in or breaches of the representations and warranties contained in
Sections 3.1 and 3.2, (i) the Buyer shall not be required to indemnify Seller
Indemnitees for Losses under clause (a) or (b) of Section 8.3 until the
aggregate amount of all such Losses exceeds the Threshold Amount, in which event
the Buyer shall be responsible only for Losses in excess of the Deductible and
(ii) in no event shall the aggregate liability of the Buyer for Losses under
clause (a) or (b) of Section 8.3 exceed the Cap.

     (c) The amount of any Losses resulting from, arising out of or relating to
any inaccuracy in or breach of any representation or warranty contained in this
Agreement or any of the Ancillary Agreements and subject to indemnification
under this Article VIII shall be determined without regard to any materiality
(except that references to GAAP shall not disregard the concept of materiality
incorporated therein), "Material Adverse Effect" or similar qualification, or
any qualification or requirement that a matter be or not be "reasonably
expected" to occur, contained in or otherwise applicable to such representation
or warranty.

     (d) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, the rights and
remedies of any party in respect of any inaccuracy or breach of any
representation, warranty, covenant or agreement shall in no way be limited by
the fact that the act, omission, occurrence or other state of facts or
circumstances upon which any claim of any such inaccuracy or breach is based may
also be the subject matter of any other representation, warranty, covenant or
agreement as to which there is no inaccuracy or breach. The Buyer shall have no
right to indemnification under this Agreement in respect of any inaccuracy or
breach of any representation or warranty of the Sellers to the extent that any
individual listed in clause (iii) of the definition of "Knowledge" contained in
Section 9.1 (but such knowledge shall not be ascribed to the Buyer or any such
individual based on the aggregate knowledge of such individuals) has actual
knowledge on the date of this Agreement that such representation and warranty is
inaccurate as of date of this Agreement. Neither the Buyer nor any individual
shall have any duty of due inquiry under this Section 8.4(d) as to any matter
whatsoever. The representations and warranties of the Sellers shall not
otherwise be affected or deemed waived by reason of any investigation made by or
on behalf of the Buyer (including but not limited to by any of its advisors,
consultants or representatives) or by reason of the fact that the Buyer or any
of such advisors, consultants or representatives knew or should have known that
any such representation or warranty is, was or might be inaccurate (regardless
of when such investigation was conducted or knowledge was obtained) or by reason
of the Buyer's waiver of any condition set forth in Section 6.2.

     (e) Except as provided in Sections 5.1 and 10.13, the indemnity provided
for in this Article VIII shall be the sole and exclusive remedy of Buyer
Indemnitees or Seller Indemnitees, as the case may be, after the Closing for any
inaccuracy of any representation or warranty of the Sellers or the Buyer,
respectively, herein or any other


                                       53

<PAGE>

breach of this Agreement; provided, however, that (i) nothing herein shall limit
in any way any such party's remedies in respect of fraud, intentional
misrepresentation or omission or intentional misconduct by the other party in
connection herewith or the transactions contemplated hereby and (ii) the
limitations on indemnification set forth in Section 8.4(a) or Section 8.4(b), as
the case may be, shall not apply to any willful or knowing breaches by any party
of its covenants set forth in this Agreement or any of the Ancillary Agreements.

     (f) The parties agree that any indemnification payments made pursuant to
this Agreement shall be treated for tax purposes as an adjustment to the
Purchase Price to the extent permitted under applicable Law and shall be
allocated among the Sellers as provided in this Agreement.

     (g) The amount of Losses indemnified under this Article VIII shall be
reduced by the net amount the Indemnified Party recovers (after deducting all
attorneys' fees, expenses, premium increases as a result of the Loss and other
costs of recovery) pursuant to any insurance policy.

     Section 8.5 Third Party Claim Procedures. In the case of any Litigation
asserted by a third party (a "Third Party Claim") against a party entitled to
indemnification under this Agreement (an "Indemnified Party"), notice shall be
given by the Indemnified Party to the party required to provide indemnification
(the "Indemnifying Party") promptly after such Indemnified Party has actual
knowledge of such Third Party Claim and in a manner consistent with Section
10.1, and the Indemnified Party shall permit the Indemnifying Party (at the
expense of such Indemnifying Party and so long as the Indemnifying Party
acknowledges in writing its obligation to indemnify the Indemnified Party for
Losses related to such Third Party Claim) to assume the defense of such Third
Party Claim, provided that (a) counsel for the Indemnifying Party who shall
conduct the defense of such Third Party Claim shall be reasonably satisfactory
to the Indemnified Party, and the Indemnified Party may participate in such
defense at such Indemnified Party's expense, and (b) the failure of any
Indemnified Party to give notice as provided herein shall not relieve the
Indemnifying Party of its indemnification obligation under this Agreement except
to the extent that such failure results in a lack of actual notice to the
Indemnifying Party and such Indemnifying Party is materially prejudiced as a
result of such failure to give notice. If the Indemnifying Party does not
promptly assume the defense of such Third Party Claim following notice thereof,
the Indemnified Party shall be entitled to assume and control such defense and
to settle or agree to pay in full such Third Party Claim without the consent of
the Indemnifying Party without prejudice to the ability of the Indemnified Party
to enforce its claim for indemnification against the Indemnifying Party
hereunder. Except with the prior written consent of the Indemnified Party, no
Indemnifying Party, in the defense of any such Third Party Claim, shall consent
to entry of any judgment or enter into any settlement that provides for
injunctive or other non-monetary relief affecting the Indemnified Party or that
does not include as an


                                       54

<PAGE>

unconditional term thereof the giving by each claimant or plaintiff to such
Indemnified Party of an irrevocable release from all liability with respect to
such Third Party Claim. If the Indemnified Party in good faith determines that
(i) the conduct of the defense or any proposed settlement of any Third Party
Claim would reasonably be expected to affect adversely the Indemnified Party's
Tax liability or the ability of the Company to conduct the Business, or (ii) the
Indemnified Party may have available to it one or more defenses or counterclaims
that are inconsistent with one or more of those that may be available to the
Indemnifying Party in respect of such Third Party Claim, the Indemnified Party
shall have the right at all times to take over and control the defense,
settlement, negotiation or Litigation relating to any such Third Party Claim at
the sole cost of the Indemnifying Party, provided that if the Indemnified Party
does so take over and control, the Indemnified Party shall not settle such Third
Party Claim without the written consent of the Indemnifying Party, such consent
not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed, and provided, further, that in the
case of clause (ii) above, the Indemnified Party will have no such right to so
take over and control where such Third Party Claim involves no potential
remedies other than monetary damages and the Indemnifying Party will pay all
such monetary damages. In any event, the Sellers and the Buyer shall cooperate
in good faith in the defense of any Third Party Claim subject to this Article
VIII and the records of each shall be reasonably available to the other with
respect to such defense.

     Section 8.6 Escrow; Right of Set-Off.

     (a) The Buyer shall exercise its rights to indemnification under this
Agreement or any of the Ancillary Agreements by giving written notice of any
Losses suffered by the Buyer or the Company that the Buyer believes in good
faith to be the obligation of one or more of the Sellers under this Agreement or
any of the Ancillary Agreements (a "Claim") to the Sellers' Representative and
the Escrow Agent pursuant to the Escrow Agreement.

     (b) In the event that the Escrow Amount is insufficient to fully satisfy
the Sellers' indemnification obligations under this Agreement or any Ancillary
Agreements, the Buyer may set off the amount of such shortfall against any
amounts payable to the individual Sellers under the Promissory Note, in
accordance with the procedures set forth therein.

     (c) Neither the exercise of nor the failure to give notice of a Claim
pursuant to the Escrow Agreement or to exercise the right of set-off pursuant to
Section 8.6(b) shall constitute an election of remedies or limit the Buyer in
any manner in the enforcement of any other remedies that may be available to it.

                                   ARTICLE IX
                                   DEFINITIONS

     Section 10.2 Amendment; Waivers, etc. No amendment, modification or
discharge of this Agreement, and no waiver hereunder, shall be valid or binding
unless set forth in writing and duly executed by the party against whom
enforcement of the amendment, modification, discharge or waiver is sought. Any
such waiver shall constitute a waiver only with respect to the specific matter
described in such writing and shall in no way impair the rights of the party
granting such waiver in any other respect or at any other time. Neither the
waiver by any of the parties hereto of a breach of or a default under any of the
provisions of this Agreement, nor the failure by any of the parties, on one or
more occasions, to enforce any of the provisions of this Agreement or to
exercise any right or privilege hereunder, shall be construed as a waiver of any
other breach or default of a similar nature, or as a waiver of any of such
provisions, rights or


                                       68

privileges hereunder. Unless otherwise specifically provided herein, the rights
and remedies herein provided are cumulative and none is exclusive of any other,
or of any rights or remedies that any party may otherwise have at law or in
equity. The rights and remedies of any party based upon, arising out of or
otherwise in respect of any inaccuracy or breach of any representation,
warranty, covenant or agreement or failure to fulfill any condition shall in no
way be limited by the fact that the act, omission, occurrence or other state of
facts upon which any claim of any such inaccuracy or breach is based may also be
the subject matter of any other representation, warranty, covenant or agreement
as to which there is no inaccuracy or breach.

     Section 10.3 Expenses. Except as otherwise provided herein, all costs and
expenses incurred in connection with this Agreement and each of the Ancillary
Agreements shall be paid by the party incurring such cost or expense. All fees
and expenses associated with the filing of the notifications of the Buyer and
the Sellers pursuant to the HSR Act (if applicable) shall be borne equally by
the Buyer, on the one hand, and the Sellers, on the other hand.

     Section 10.4 Governing Law, etc.

     (a) THIS AGREEMENT SHALL BE GOVERNED IN ALL RESPECTS, INCLUDING AS TO
VALIDITY, INTERPRETATION AND EFFECT, BY THE LAWS OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK,
WITHOUT GIVING EFFECT TO ITS PRINCIPLES OR RULES OF CONFLICT OF LAWS, TO THE
EXTENT SUCH PRINCIPLES OR RULES ARE NOT MANDATORILY APPLICABLE BY STATUTE AND
WOULD PERMIT OR REQUIRE THE APPLICATION OF THE LAWS OF ANOTHER JURISDICTION. The
Buyer and each of the Sellers hereby irrevocably submit to the jurisdiction of
the courts of the State of New York and the Federal courts of the United States
of America located in the State, City and County of New York solely in respect
of the interpretation and enforcement of the provisions of this Agreement and of
the documents referred to in this Agreement, and in respect of the transactions
contemplated hereby and thereby. The Buyer and each of the Sellers irrevocably
agree that all claims in respect of the interpretation and enforcement of the
provisions of this Agreement and of the Ancillary Agreements, and in respect of
the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby, or with respect to any such
action or proceeding, shall be heard and determined in such a New York State or
Federal court, and that such jurisdiction of such courts with respect thereto
shall be exclusive, except solely to the extent that all such courts shall
lawfully decline to exercise such jurisdiction. The Buyer and each of the
Sellers hereby waive, and agree not to assert, as a defense in any action, suit
or proceeding for the interpretation or enforcement hereof or of any such
document or in respect of any such transaction, that it is not subject to such
jurisdiction. The Buyer and each of the Sellers hereby waive, and agree not to
assert, to the maximum extent permitted by law, as a defense in any action, suit
or proceeding for the interpretation or enforcement hereof or of any such
document or in respect of any such transaction, that


                                       69

<PAGE>

such action, suit or proceeding may not be brought or is not maintainable in
such courts or that the venue thereof may not be appropriate or that this
Agreement or any such document may not be enforced in or by such courts. The
Buyer and each of the Sellers hereby consent to and grant any such court
jurisdiction over the person of such parties and over the subject matter of any
such dispute and agree that mailing of process or other papers in connection
with any such action or proceeding in the manner provided in Section 10.1 or in
such other manner as may be permitted by law, shall be valid and sufficient
service thereof.

     (b) EACH PARTY ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES THAT ANY CONTROVERSY WHICH MAY ARISE
UNDER THIS AGREEMENT IS LIKELY TO INVOLVE COMPLICATED AND DIFFICULT ISSUES, AND
THEREFORE EACH SUCH PARTY HEREBY IRREVOCABLY AND UNCONDITIONALLY WAIVES ANY
RIGHT SUCH PARTY MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN RESPECT OF ANY LITIGATION
DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT OR ANY OF
THE ANCILLARY AGREEMENTS, OR THE BREACH, TERMINATION OR VALIDITY OF THIS
AGREEMENT OR ANY OF THE ANCILLARY AGREEMENTS, OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED
HEREBY OR THEREBY. EACH PARTY CERTIFIES AND ACKNOWLEDGES THAT (I) NO
REPRESENTATIVE, AGENT OR ATTORNEY OF ANY OTHER PARTY HAS REPRESENTED, EXPRESSLY
OR OTHERWISE, THAT SUCH OTHER PARTY WOULD NOT, IN THE EVENT OF LITIGATION, SEEK
TO ENFORCE THE FOREGOING WAIVER, (II) EACH SUCH PARTY UNDERSTANDS AND HAS
CONSIDERED THE IMPLICATIONS OF THIS WAIVER, (III) EACH SUCH PARTY MAKES THIS
WAIVER VOLUNTARILY, AND (IV) EACH SUCH PARTY HAS BEEN INDUCED TO ENTER INTO THIS
AGREEMENT BY, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE MUTUAL WAIVERS AND CERTIFICATIONS IN THIS
SECTION 10.4(b).

     Section 10.5 Binding Effect. This Agreement shall be binding upon and inure
to the benefit of the parties hereto and their respective heirs, successors and
permitted assigns.

     Section 10.6 Sellers' Representative.

     (a) Each of the Sellers (other than the ESOP) hereby irrevocably appoints
Warren B. Murrin (the "Sellers' Representative") as his, her or its agent, proxy
and attorney-in-fact for all purposes under this Agreement, and each such Seller
authorizes the Sellers' Representative to do any and all of the following for
such Seller and in such Seller's name and stead: (i) to execute, acknowledge, as
appropriate, and deliver to the Buyer any certificate, document or agreement
referred to herein or contemplated hereby (other than the Restricted Shares
Agreement to which such Seller is a party, if any); (ii) to accept, receipt for
and deposit any funds or other amounts owing to the Sellers (other than the
ESOP) hereunder; (iii) to represent, negotiate on behalf of and bind the Sellers
(other


                                       70

<PAGE>

than the ESOP) in connection with the determination of the purchase price
adjustment amount pursuant to Section 1.4, any negotiations or agreements with
the Buyer with respect to the purchase price adjustment under Section 1.4, and
any presentation to or discussions with the Independent Accountant with respect
thereto; (iv) to pay the purchase price adjustment amount, if any, due from the
Sellers (other than the ESOP) to the Buyer in accordance with Section 1.4,
subject to the individual Sellers' prior payment or prompt reimbursement of such
amount to the Sellers' Representative; (v) to represent, negotiate on behalf of
and bind the Sellers (other than the ESOP) in connection with the determination
of any indemnification claims under this Agreement or any of the Ancillary
Agreements or any negotiations or agreements with the Buyer with respect to
indemnification, and to make any indemnification payments under this Agreement
or any of the Ancillary Agreements on behalf of the Sellers (other than the
ESOP); (vi) on behalf of the Sellers (other than the ESOP), to execute,
acknowledge, as appropriate, and deliver such modifications and amendments to
this Agreement or any of the Ancillary Agreements as the Sellers' Representative
shall deem advisable in his discretion; and (vii) to do any and all other acts
and things on behalf of the Sellers (other than the ESOP) in connection with
this Agreement or any of the Ancillary Agreements as the Sellers' Representative
shall deem advisable in his discretion. The agency created hereby shall be
deemed irrevocable and coupled with an interest. The Buyer shall be entitled to
rely upon the powers granted herein with respect to any matter relating to this
Agreement or any of the Ancillary Agreements, and any question which may arise
concerning the power or authority of the Sellers' Representative to act for each
Seller (other than the ESOP) shall be interpreted and construed in favor of the
authority of the Sellers' Representative.

     (b) The Sellers' Representative shall not be liable to any Seller with
respect to any actions taken (or not taken) by the Sellers' Representative in
the performance of his duties under this Agreement and any other document or
agreement referred to herein or contemplated hereby, except to the extent that
such actions were taken (or not taken) as a result of the intentional misconduct
of the Sellers' Representative.

     Section 10.7 Assignment. This Agreement shall not be assignable or
otherwise transferable by any party hereto without the prior written consent of
the other parties hereto. Notwithstanding the foregoing, without the consent of
the other parties hereto, the Buyer may transfer or assign (including by way of
a pledge), in whole or from time to time in part with prior written notice to
the Sellers, (a) to one or more of its Affiliates, the right to purchase all or
a portion of the Shares, but no such transfer or assignment will relieve the
Buyer of its obligations hereunder or (b) to its lenders or other financing
sources under its credit facilities any or all of its rights hereunder
(including its rights to seek indemnification hereunder) as collateral security
for indebtedness, but no such transfer or assignment will relieve the Buyer of
its obligations hereunder. Upon any such permitted assignment, the references in
this Agreement to the Buyer shall also apply to any such assignee unless the
context otherwise requires.

     Section 10.8 No Third Party Beneficiaries. Except as provided in Article
VIII with respect to indemnification of Indemnified Parties hereunder, nothing
in this Agreement shall confer any rights upon any person or entity other than
the parties hereto and their respective heirs, successors and permitted assigns.

     Section 10.9 Entire Agreement. This Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements
(when executed and delivered) constitute the entire agreement and supersede all
prior agreements and understandings, both written and oral, between the parties
with respect to the subject matter hereof.

     Section 10.10 Severability. If any provision, including any phrase,
sentence, clause, section or subsection, of this Agreement is invalid,
inoperative or unenforceable for any reason, such circumstances shall not have
the effect of rendering such provision in question invalid, inoperative or
unenforceable in any other case or circumstance, or of rendering any other
provision herein contained invalid, inoperative, or unenforceable to any extent
whatsoever so long as the economic or legal substance of the transactions
contemplated hereby is not affected in any matter materially adverse to any
party. Upon such determination, the parties shall negotiate in good faith to
modify this Agreement so as to effect the original intent of the parties as
closely as possible in an acceptable manner in order that the transactions
contemplated hereby be consummated as originally contemplated to the fullest
extent possible.

     Section 10.11 Headings. The headings contained in this Agreement are for
purposes of convenience only and shall not affect the meaning or interpretation
of this Agreement.

     Section 10.12 Counterparts. This Agreement may be executed in several
counterparts, each of which shall be deemed an original and all of which shall
together constitute one and the same instrument.

     Section 10.13 Specific Performance. The parties hereto agree that
irreparable damage would occur if any provision of this Agreement were not
performed in accordance with the terms hereof and that the parties shall be
entitled to an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement
or to enforce specifically the performance of the terms and provisions hereof in
any court specified in Section 10.4, in addition to any other remedy to which
they are entitled at law or in equity.
