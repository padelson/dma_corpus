ARTICLE II 

   

CONVERSION OF SECURITIES; EXCHANGE OF CERTIFICATES; DEPOSIT; 
 DISCLOSURE SCHEDULES  

  

 Section 2.01 _Effect on Capital Stock_. At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of the Company, Parent, Merger Sub or the holder of any of the following securities: 

   

 (a) _Capital Stock of Merger Sub_. Each share of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of Merger Sub issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be converted into one fully paid and nonassessable share of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of the Surviving Corporation. 

   

 (b)  _Cancellation of Company Owned Stock; Conversion of Parent Owned Stock_. All shares of Company Common Stock that are held in the treasury of the Company (other than (x) Company Common Shares held by any direct or indirect wholly owned subsidiary of the Company (which shares, in the aggregate, shall be converted into one fully paid and nonassessable share of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of 

   ##### 

  

    

the Surviving Corporation) and (y) shares of Company Common Stock owned,
directly or indirectly, in trust accounts, managed accounts and the like or
otherwise held in a fiduciary or custodial capacity that are beneficially
owned by third parties and other than any shares of Company Common Stock
held in respect of a debt previously contracted) shall be canceled and shall
cease to exist without any consideration being payable therefor. All shares
of Company Common Stock held by Parent or any wholly owned subsidiary of
Parent (other than shares of Company Common Stock owned, directly or
indirectly, in trust accounts, managed accounts and the like or otherwise
held in a fiduciary or custodial capacity that are beneficially owned by
third parties and other than any shares of Company Common Stock held in
respect of a debt previously contracted), in the aggregate, shall be
converted into one fully paid and nonassessable share of common stock, par
value $0.01 per share, of the Surviving Corporation. 

   

 (c) _Conversion of Company Common Stock_. Each share of Company Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than (i) Dissenting Shares, if applicable, and (ii) shares of Company Common Stock canceled or converted into common stock of the Surviving Corporation in accordance with Section 2.01(b)), shall be converted into the right to receive from the Surviving Corporation $32.33 in cash (the "Merger Consideration") without interest thereon upon surrender of the certificate previously representing such share of Company Common Stock as provided in Section 2.02(c). As of the Effective Time, all shares of Company Common Stock (other than (i) Dissenting Shares, if applicable, and (ii) shares of Company Common Stock canceled or converted into common stock of the Surviving Corporation in accordance with Section 2.01(b)) shall no longer be outstanding and shall automatically be canceled and shall cease to exist, and each certificate (a "Certificate") which immediately prior to the Effective Time represented any such share of Company Common Stock (other than Certificates representing (i) Dissenting Shares, if applicable, and (ii) shares of Company Common Stock canceled or converted into common stock of the Surviving Corporation in accordance with Section 2.01(b)) shall cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except the right to receive the Merger Consideration and any dividends or other distributions to which holders become entitled in accordance with this Article II upon the surrender of such Certificate. 

   

 (d) _Treatment of Class B Common Stock_. The share of Class B Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be converted into one fully paid and nonassessable share of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of the Surviving Corporation. 

  

 Section 2.02 _Exchange Procedures_. (a) At and after the Effective Time, each Certificate formerly representing shares of Company Common Stock shall (except for shares of Company Common Stock canceled or converted into common stock of the Surviving Corporation in accordance with Section 2.01(b) and subject to applicable law in the case of Dissenting Shares) represent only the right to receive the Merger Consideration, without interest. 

  

 (b) At or prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall or shall cause Merger Sub to deposit, or cause to be deposited, with a bank or trust company reasonably satisfactory to the Company (the "Paying Agent"), for the benefit of the holders of the Certificates, funds in the 

   ##### 

  

    

aggregate amount to be paid pursuant to this Article II in exchange for
outstanding shares of Company Common Stock. Any cash deposited with the
Paying Agent shall hereinafter be referred to as the Exchange Fund. 

  

 (c) As promptly as practicable after the Effective Time but in no event later than two business days following the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall send or cause to be sent to each holder of record of shares of Company Common Stock (other than shares that are to be canceled or converted into common stock of the Surviving Corporation pursuant to Section 2.01(b)) immediately prior to the Effective Time transmittal materials for use in exchanging Certificates for the Merger Consideration. The Surviving Corporation shall cause any check in respect of the Merger Consideration (together with any dividends or other distributions to which holders become entitled in accordance with this Article II upon surrender of such Certificate) which such person shall be entitled to receive to be delivered to such stockholder upon delivery to the Paying Agent of Certificates formerly representing such shares of Company Common Stock (or indemnity reasonably satisfactory to the Surviving Corporation and the Paying Agent, if any of such Certificates are lost, stolen or destroyed) owned by such stockholder, together with a letter of transmittal, duly completed and validly executed in accordance with the instructions thereto, and such other documents as may reasonably be required pursuant to such instructions, and thereafter such Certificate shall be canceled. In the event of a transfer of ownership of the shares of Company Common Stock that is not registered in the transfer records of the Company, payment may be made to a person other than the person in whose name the Certificate so surrendered is registered, if such Certificate shall be properly endorsed or otherwise be in proper form for transfer and the person requesting such payment shall pay any transfer or other taxes required by reason of the payment to a person other than the registered holder of such Certificate or establish to the satisfaction of the Surviving Corporation that such tax has been paid or is not applicable. No interest will be paid on any such cash to be paid pursuant to this Article II upon such delivery. The Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the Merger Consideration otherwise payable to any holder of Certificates such taxes (if any) as Parent, the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent is required to deduct and withhold under the Code, or any provision of United States, state or local tax law or non-U.S. tax law (other than a Canadian withholding tax imposed by virtue of Parent being created, organized or doing business in Canada). To the extent that amounts are so withheld by the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent, such withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the holder of such Certificates. 

  

 (d) Subject to Section 2.04, at the Effective Time, holders of Company Common Stock shall cease to be, and shall have no rights as, stockholders of the Company, other than to receive the Merger Consideration and any dividend or other distribution with respect to the Company Common Stock with a record date occurring prior to the Effective Time (or, with respect to shares of Company Common Stock converted into common stock of the Surviving Corporation in accordance with Section 2.01(b), as expressly provided in Section 2.01(b)). From and after the Effective Time, there shall be no transfers on the stock transfer records of the Company of any shares of the Company Common Stock that were outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time. If, after the Effective Time, Certificates are presented to the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent for transfer, they shall be canceled and exchanged for the Merger Consideration deliverable in respect thereof pursuant to this Agreement in accordance with the procedures set forth in this Section 2.02 together with any dividends or other 

   ##### 

  

    

distributions to which the holder becomes entitled in accordance with this
Article II upon the surrender of such Certificates. 

  

 (e) Any funds (including any interest with respect thereto) which have been made available to the Paying Agent and that remain unclaimed by the former stockholders of the Company for six months after the Effective Time shall be paid to the Surviving Corporation. Any former stockholders of the Company who have not theretofore complied with this Article II shall thereafter look only to the Surviving Corporation and Parent for payment of the Merger Consideration in respect of each share of Company Common Stock formerly held by such stockholder as determined pursuant to this Agreement, in each case, without any interest thereon. Any Merger Consideration remaining unclaimed as of a date which is immediately prior to such time as such amounts would otherwise escheat to or become property of any Governmental Entity shall, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, become the property of the Surviving Corporation free and clear of any claims or interest of any person previously entitled thereto. Notwithstanding the foregoing, none of the Paying Agent, Parent, the Company, Merger Sub or the Surviving Corporation shall be liable to any former holder of Company Common Stock for any amount properly delivered to a public official pursuant to applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar laws. 

  

 (f) In the event any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of a customary affidavit of that fact by the person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if required by the Paying Agent, the Surviving Corporation or Parent, as the case may be, the posting by such person of a bond in such amount as the Paying Agent, the Surviving Corporation or Parent, as the case may be, may reasonably direct as indemnity against any claim that may be made against it with respect to such Certificate, the Paying Agent, the Surviving Corporation or Parent, as the case may be, shall issue in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate the applicable Merger Consideration deliverable in respect thereof pursuant to this Agreement and any dividends or other distributions to which holders become entitled in accordance with this Article II upon the surrender of such Certificate. 

  

 (g) Any portion of the Merger Consideration made available to the Paying Agent pursuant to this Section 2.02 to pay for shares of Company Common Stock for which appraisal rights have been perfected in accordance with Section 262 of the DGCL shall be returned to the Surviving Corporation upon demand. 

  

 (h) The Paying Agent shall invest any cash included in the Exchange Fund, as directed by Parent, on a daily basis; provided, that in the case of any losses incurred in the Exchange Fund as a result of such investments, Parent shall, or shall cause the Surviving Corporation, to take all actions necessary (including by depositing additional cash) to ensure that the Exchange Fund includes cash sufficient to satisfy the obligations of Parent and the Surviving Corporation to pay the Merger Consideration payable pursuant to this Article II and any dividends or other distributions to which holders become entitled in accordance with this Article II upon the surrender of Certificates. Any interest and other income resulting from such investments shall be paid to or at the direction of the Surviving Corporation. 

  

 Section 2.03 _Company Stock Options; Company Restricted Shares, Deferred Stock Units and Restricted Stock Units; ESPP_. 

   ##### 

  

  

 (a) _Stock Options_. __  

  

 (i) _Cash-Out Options_. At the Effective Time, each option (and any stock appreciation rights associated therewith) to purchase a share of Company Common Stock that would in accordance with its terms expire no later than December 31, 2008 (a "Cash-Out Option" and, collectively, the "Cash-Out Options") outstanding and unexercised as of the Effective Time granted pursuant to the Amended and Restated 2003 Equity Incentive Plan, the 1996 Equity Incentive Plan, as amended, the Amended and Restated Banknorth Group, Inc. 1995 Stock Option Plan for Non-Employee Directors and any other equity-based plans or agreements of or with the Company or any of its Subsidiaries providing for the granting of options with respect to Company Common Stock (collectively, the "Company Stock Option Plans") shall vest and be converted into the right to receive at the Effective Time the product of (i) the excess (rounded to the nearest $0.01), if any, of (A) the Merger Consideration over (B) the exercise price per share of Company Common Stock subject to such Cash-Out Option and (ii) the number of shares of Company Common Stock subject to such Cash-Out Option. All payments made pursuant to this Section 2.03(a)(i) shall be reduced by all withholding taxes required by law to be withheld. 

   

 (ii) _Rollover Options._ At the Effective Time, each option (and any stock appreciation right associated therewith) to purchase a share of Company Common Stock other than a Cash-Out Option (a "Rollover Option," collectively, the "Rollover Options" and, together with the Cash-Out Options, the "Options") outstanding and unexercised as of the Effective Time granted pursuant to the Company Stock Option Plans , whether or not vested or exercisable, shall cease to represent a right to acquire shares of Company Common Stock and shall be converted into an option to acquire a number of common shares of Parent ("Parent Common Shares"), at a per share exercise price, as provided below (a "Converted Option"): 

    

 (A) the number of Parent Common Shares to be subject to the Converted Option shall be equal to the product of (x) the number of shares of Company Common Stock subject to the Option multiplied by (y) the Exchange Ratio (as defined below), provided that any fractional Parent Common Shares resulting from such multiplication shall be rounded down to the nearest whole share; and 

   

 (B) the exercise price per Parent Common Share under the Converted Option shall be equal to (x) the exercise price per share of Company Common Stock under the Option divided by (y) the Exchange Ratio, provided that such exercise price shall be rounded up to the nearest cent. 

  

 (iii) "Exchange Ratio" shall mean the Merger Consideration divided by the Valuation Weighted Average Share Price. Valuation Weighted Average Share Price shall mean the average of the daily weighted average prices for the Parent Common Shares on the Toronto Stock Exchange, based on the trading data published in the Toronto Stock Exchange Daily Record, for the ten consecutive full trading days (the "Valuation Period") ending on the third business day prior to the Effective Time (for the sake of clarity, such third business day shall be considered the last full trading day included within the Valuation Period), rounded to the nearest three decimal places and converted 

     ##### 

 

    

into United States dollars using the spot exchange rate reported in The Wall
Street Journal (or such other publication as may be mutually agreed by Parent
and the Company), for each applicable day, on the business day immediately
following such day. 

   

 (iv) In the case of any Rollover Option to which Section 421 of the Code applies by reason of its qualification under Section 422 of the Code, the option price, the number of shares subject to such option and the terms and conditions of exercise of such option shall be determined in a manner consistent with the requirements of Section 424(a) of the Code. In all events, the Rollover Options shall be converted into Converted Options in a manner intended to be compliant with Section 409A of the Code and any guidance issued thereupon by the U.S. Department of Treasury and the Toronto Stock Exchange, if necessary (it being understood, however, that in no event shall Parent seek shareholder approval of the treatment of the Rollover Options pursuant to Section 2.03(a)(ii) above). Except as otherwise provided in this Section 2.03(a), the duration and other terms of each Converted Option shall be the same as the applicable Rollover Option except that all references to the Company shall be deemed to be references to Parent. 

   

 (v) Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event that Parent determines within 30 days after the date hereof, that the treatment of the Rollover Options pursuant to Section 2.03(a)(ii) above would require the approval of the shareholders of Parent under the rules of the Toronto Stock Exchange, or would involve material tax, legal or accounting risks or material costs to Parent, Parent shall, by written notice delivered to the Company at least 10 days after the date of such determination, cause all Rollover Options to terminate and be cashed out at the Effective Time pursuant to the methodology provided in Section 2.03(a)(i) relating to Cash-Out Options, rather that being amended or adjusted pursuant to Section 2.03(a)(ii). 

  

 (b) _Restricted Shares, Deferred Stock Accounts and Restricted Stock Units_. 

  

 (i) _Restricted Shares._ At the Effective Time, each share of restricted stock (a "Restricted Share" and, collectively, the "Restricted Shares") outstanding as of the Effective Time issued pursuant to a Company Stock Option Plan or any other equity-based plans or agreements of or with the Company or any of its Subsidiaries providing for the granting of restricted stock awards with respect to Company Common Stock (collectively, the "Company Equity Plans" and together with the Company Stock Option Plans, the "Company Stock Plans"), to the extent not already vested, shall vest and be converted into the right to receive at the Effective Time the Merger Consideration. All payments made pursuant to this Section 2.03(b)(i) shall be reduced by all applicable withholding taxes. 

   

 (ii) _Deferred Stock Accounts._ At the Effective Time, each notional stock account with respect to Company Common Stock under the Company deferred compensation plan shall cease to represent a notional investment in shares of Company Common Stock and shall be converted into a notional cash account equal to the product of (x) the number of shares of Company Common Stock subject to such stock account multiplied by (y) the Merger Consideration, and thereafter, the other hypothetical investment options under the plan shall be available for the hypothetical amounts formerly in a participants notional stock account. 

     ##### 

  

     

 (iii) _Restricted Stock Units under the Company Equity Plans._ At the Effective Time, each restricted stock unit in respect of Company Common Stock or, in the case of awards granted under the 2005 Performance-Based Restricted Share Unit Plan of TD Banknorth Inc., Parent Common Shares (a "Restricted Stock Unit" and, collectively, the "Restricted Stock Units"), granted pursuant to the Company Stock Plans, including those granted under the TD Banknorth Inc. Amended and Restated 2003 Equity Incentive Plan (the awards being the "2003 RSUs" and such plan being the "2003 Equity Plan"), that is outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time will be amended or adjusted to provide that (i) each Restricted Stock Unit (to the extent not already denominated in Parent Common Shares) will be valued with reference to Parent Common Shares, rather than valued with reference to shares of Company Common Stock and (ii) the number of notional Parent Common Shares subject to such amended or adjusted award will be equal to the product of (x) the number of notional shares of Company Common Stock in respect of such award immediately prior to amendment or adjustment multiplied by (y) the Exchange Ratio. Moreover the performance criteria relating to Restricted Stock Units will be adjusted as follows: 

    

 (A) With respect to performance-based 2003 RSUs awarded in March 2005, performance for the first two-year performance period (January 2005  December 2006) will be based on the Companys actual performance (as currently contemplated under the terms of such awards). The Parent and the Company will work together in good faith to adjust or amend the performance measure applicable to such awards for the third and final year of their performance period to be the same or substantially similar to those used under the 2005 Performance Based Restricted Share Plan of The Toronto-Dominion Bank (the "PSU Plan"), which uses the Parents relative Total Shareholder Return (as defined in the PSU Plan) for the period November 1, 2006 to October 31, 2007 compared to a peer group (currently defined as the four other large Canadian banks), with the performance calculation performed in the same manner as the calculation under the PSU Plan and the performance factor to be applied being not less than 80 percent or greater than 120 percent (the "Parent PSU Performance Methodology"). 

   

 (B) With respect to performance-based 2003 RSUs awarded in January 2006, performance for the first year performance period (January 2006 to December 2006) will be based on the Companys actual performance (as currently contemplated under the terms of such awards). The Parent and the Company will work together in good faith to adjust or amend the performance measure under the Plan for the second and third years of the performance period to be the same or substantially similar to the Parent PSU Performance Methodology (over the Parents fiscal year). 

   

 (C) With respect to Restricted Stock Units granted pursuant to the 2005 Performance Based Restricted Share Unit Plan of TD Banknorth Inc., performance for the first two-year performance period (January 2005  December 2006) will be based on the Companys actual performance (as currently contemplated under the terms of such awards). The Parent and the Company will work together in good faith to adjust or amend the performance measures 

   ##### 

  

    

applicable to such awards for the third and final year of their performance
period to be the same or substantially similar to the Parent PSU Performance
Methodology (over the Parents fiscal year); provided that such awards will
be settled as if "target" (i.e. 100%) performance had been
achieved throughout their entire performance period, if such settlement would
be more favorable to holders (other than holders whose award agreements were
amended on January 31, 2006). 

  

 (c) _ESPP_. The Company shall take any and all actions with respect to the Companys Amended and Restated Employee Stock Purchase Plan (the "ESPP") as are necessary to provide that (i) at the end of the offering period in effect as of the date of this Agreement (which ends December 31, 2006), the ESPP shall be suspended and no new offering period shall commence under the ESPP prior to the termination of this Agreement and (ii) the ESPP shall terminate as of immediately prior to the Effective Time (if not sooner terminated at the Companys discretion). The Company shall not permit any increase in participant deferral elections or any new participant enrollments in the ESPP on or after the date hereof. 

  

 (d) _Genera_ l. Prior to the Effective Time or at the Effective Time, the Company will adopt such resolutions and will take such other actions as may be reasonably required to effectuate the actions contemplated by this Section 2.03, provided that the Company shall not (and shall not be required to) pay any consideration or incur any debts or obligations on behalf of the Company or Surviving Corporation (or Parent) and as of the Effective Time, the Company shall, in consultation with Parent, remove, or cause to be removed from each and every plan, program, agreement or arrangement any right of any participant thereunder to invest in, or receive a distribution in, Company Common Stock. 

  

 Section 2.04 _Shares of Dissenting Stockholders_. (a) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, any shares (the "Dissenting Shares") of Company Common Stock that are issued and outstanding as of the Effective Time and that are held by a holder who has not voted in favor of the Merger or consented thereto in writing and who properly demands and perfects appraisal of such Dissenting Shares pursuant to, and who complies in all respects with, Section 262 of the DGCL, shall not be converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration as provided in Section 2.01(c), unless and until such holder shall have failed to perfect, or shall have effectively withdrawn or lost, his or her right to appraisal under the DGCL, and instead shall be entitled to receive such consideration as may be determined to be due with respect to such Dissenting Shares pursuant to and subject to the requirements of Section 262 of the DGCL. If, after the Effective Time, any such holder shall have failed to perfect or shall have effectively withdrawn or lost such right, each share of such holders Company Common Stock shall thereupon be deemed to have been converted into and to have become, as of the Effective Time, the right to receive, without interest, the Merger Consideration, in accordance with Section 2.01 (together with any dividends or other distributions to which holders of Certificates become entitled in accordance with this Article II upon the surrender of such Certificates). 

  

 (b) The Company shall give Merger Sub and Parent (i) prompt notice of any notices or demands (or withdrawals of notices or demands) for appraisal or payment for shares of Company Common Stock received by the Company and (ii) the opportunity to participate in and direct all negotiations and proceedings with respect to any such demands or notices. The 

   ##### 

  

    

Company shall not, without prior written consent of Merger Sub and Parent,
make any payments, or settle, offer to settle or otherwise negotiate, with
respect to any such demands. 

  

 (c) From and after the Effective Time, holders of Dissenting Shares shall cease to be, and shall have no rights as, stockholders of the Company, other than to receive such consideration as may be determined to be due with respect to such Dissenting Shares pursuant to Section 262 of the DGCL and any dividend or other distribution with respect to the Company Common Stock with a record date occurring prior to the Effective Time. 

  

 Section 2.05 _Adjustment of Merger Consideration_. In the event that, subsequent to the date of this Agreement but prior to the Effective Time, the outstanding shares of Company Common Stock shall have been changed into a different number of shares or a different class as a result of a stock split, reverse stock split, stock dividend, subdivision, reclassification, split, combination, exchange, recapitalization or other similar transaction, the Merger Consideration and any other number or amount which is based upon the number of shares of Company Common Stock shall be appropriately adjusted. 

  

 Section 2.06 _Disclosure Schedules_. (a) Prior to the execution and delivery of this Agreement, the Company has delivered to Parent and Merger Sub, and Parent and Merger Sub have delivered to the Company, a schedule (in the case of the Company, the "Company Disclosure Schedule," and, in the case of Parent and Merger Sub, the "Parent Disclosure Schedule") setting forth, among other things, in each case with respect to specified sections of this Agreement, items the disclosure of which is necessary or appropriate either in response to an express disclosure requirement contained in a provision hereof or as an exception to one or more of such partys representations or warranties contained in Article III, in the case of the Company, or Article IV, in the case of Parent and Merger Sub, or to one or more of such partys covenants contained in Article V; provided, however, that notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, (i) no such item is required to be set forth in a Disclosure Schedule as an exception to a representation or warranty if its absence would not result in the related representation or warranty being deemed untrue or incorrect under the standard established by Section 2.06(b), and (ii) the mere inclusion of an item in a Disclosure Schedule as an exception to a representation or warranty shall not be deemed an admission by a party that such item represents a material exception or material fact, event or circumstance or that such item has had or would have a Material Adverse Effect with respect to the Company or Parent, respectively. Matters disclosed in any particular section of a Disclosure Schedule shall be deemed to have been disclosed in any other section with respect to which such matter is relevant so long as the relevance of such disclosure is readily apparent. 

  

 (b) No representation of the Company contained in Article III (other than Section 3.02(a), which shall be true in all material respects, and Section 3.10, which shall be true and correct in all respects) or of Parent or Merger Sub contained in Article IV shall be deemed untrue or incorrect for any purpose under this Agreement, and no party hereto shall be deemed to have breached a representation or warranty for any purpose under this Agreement, in any case as a consequence of the existence or absence of any fact, circumstance or event unless such fact, circumstance or event, individually or when taken together with all other facts, circumstances or events inconsistent with any representations or warranties contained in Article III, in the case of the Company, or Article IV, in the case of Parent or Merger Sub, has had or would be reasonably 

   ##### 

  

    

likely to have a Material Adverse Effect with respect to the Company or
Parent, respectively. For all purposes of determining whether any facts or
events contravening a representation or warranty contained herein constitute,
individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect, representations
and warranties contained in Article III (other than Section 3.10) or IV shall
be read without regard to any reference to materiality or to Material Adverse
Effect set forth therein.

ADDITIONAL AGREEMENTS  

  

 Section 6.01 _Stockholders  Meeting_. (a) The Company shall take all lawful action to call and hold a meeting of its stockholders (the "Company Meeting") as promptly as practicable following the date hereof for the purpose of voting upon the adoption of this Agreement. The Company, through its Board of Directors and the Special Committee, shall use its reasonable best efforts to obtain from the stockholders of the Company the Company Stockholder Approval in favor of adoption of this Agreement, including recommending that the stockholders of the Company vote in favor of the adoption of this Agreement. However, if the Board of Directors of the Company, acting upon the recommendation of the Special Committee (after consultation by such committee with outside counsel), determines in good faith that, because of the receipt after the date of this Agreement by the Company of an Acquisition Proposal (as defined in Section 6.03) that the Board of Directors of the Company (acting upon the recommendation of the Special Committee) concludes in good faith constitutes a Superior Proposal (as defined in 

   ##### 

  

 

Section 6.03), it would result in a violation of its fiduciary duties under
applicable law to continue to recommend this Agreement, then the Board
of Directors of the Company may submit this Agreement to its stockholders
without such recommendation; provided that the Board of Directors of the
Company (or any committee thereof) may not take any actions under this
sentence until after giving Parent at least 5 business days to respond to
any such Acquisition Proposal (and after giving Parent notice of the latest
material terms, conditions and third party in the Acquisition Proposal) and
then taking into account any amendment or modification to this Agreement
proposed by Parent. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in
this Agreement, unless this Agreement has been terminated, this Agreement
shall be submitted to the stockholders of the Company at the Company Meeting
for the purpose of voting on the approval and adoption of this Agreement. 

   

 (b) Parent shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries to, vote (or consent with respect to) any shares of Company Common Stock and Class B Common Stock beneficially owned by it, or with respect to which it has the power (by agreement, proxy or otherwise) to vote or cause to be voted (or to provide a consent) (other than any such shares held in trust accounts, managed accounts and the like for the benefit of third parties), in favor of the approval and adoption of this Agreement at any meeting of the stockholders of the Company at which this Agreement shall be submitted for approval and adoption and at all adjournments or postponements thereof (or, if applicable, by any action of the stockholders of the Company by consent in lieu of a meeting). 

  

 Section 6.02 _Regulatory Matters_. (a) Parent, Merger Sub and the Company shall cooperate in preparing preliminary proxy materials, including the information required by Schedule 13E-3, relating to the Company Meeting (together with any amendments thereof or supplements thereto, the "Proxy Statement") and the Schedule 13E-3. The Company shall, as soon as practicable, file (after receiving Parents consent thereto, not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed) the Proxy Statement and Parent, Merger Sub and the Company shall, as soon as practicable, jointly file the Schedule 13E-3. Each of Parent, Merger Sub and the Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to respond to any comments of the SEC (after providing Parent and Merger Sub (in the case of a response by the Company) or the Company (in the case of a response by Parent or Merger Sub) with a reasonable opportunity to review and comment thereon) and to cause the Proxy Statement to be mailed to the Companys stockholders as promptly as practicable after responding to all such comments to the satisfaction of the SEC staff. The Company shall notify Parent and Merger Sub as promptly as practicable of the receipt of any comments from the SEC and of any request by the SEC for amendments or supplements to the Proxy Statement or the Schedule 13E-3 for additional information and shall supply Parent and Merger Sub with copies of all correspondence between the Company or any of its representatives, on the one hand, and the SEC, on the other hand, with respect to the Proxy Statement, the Schedule 13E-3 or the transactions contemplated hereby. The Company will cause the Proxy Statement and the Schedule 13E-3 (other than portions relating to Parent or Merger Sub) to comply in all material respects with the applicable provisions of the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations thereunder applicable to the Proxy Statement and the solicitation of proxies for the Company Meeting (including any requirement to amend or supplement the Proxy Statement) and the Schedule 13E-3. Parent and Merger Sub will cause those portions of the Proxy Statement and the Schedule 13E-3 relating to Parent and Merger Sub to comply in all material respects with the applicable provisions of the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations thereunder applicable to the Proxy Statement and the Schedule 13E-3. 

   ##### 

  

 

Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, each party shall furnish
to the other such information relating to it and its affiliates and the
transactions contemplated hereby and such further and supplemental
information as may be reasonably requested by the other party and shall
promptly notify the other party of any change in such information. The
Company, as to itself and its Subsidiaries, and Parent and Merger Sub, as to
themselves and each of their Subsidiaries, agrees that none of the
information supplied or to be supplied by it for inclusion or incorporation

 (b) Subject to Section 6.01(a) hereof, the Company shall include in the Proxy Statement the recommendation of the Companys Board of Directors and the Special Committee that the stockholders of the Company approve and adopt this Agreement.

Parent, the Company and Merger Sub shall, to the extent practicable, consult each other on, in each case subject to applicable laws relating to the exchange of information, all the information relating to the Company, Merger Sub or Parent, as the case may be, and any of their respective Subsidiaries, which appear in any filing made with, or written materials submitted to, any third party or any Governmental Entity in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby. In exercising the foregoing right, each of the parties hereto shall act reasonably and as promptly as practicable. The parties hereto agree that they will consult with each other with respect to the obtaining of all permits, consents, approvals and authorizations of all third parties and Governmental Entities necessary or advisable to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby and each party will keep the other apprised of the status of matters relating to completion of the transactions contemplated hereby. 

   ##### 

  

  

 (d) Parent, Merger Sub and the Company shall, upon request, furnish each other with all information concerning themselves, their Subsidiaries, directors, officers and stockholders and such other matters as may be reasonably necessary or advisable in connection with any statement, filing, notice or application made by or on behalf of Parent, Merger Sub, the Company or any of their respective Subsidiaries to any Governmental Entity in connection with the Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby. 

  

 Section 6.03 _No Solicitation_. From and after the date hereof, the Company shall not, and shall not authorize or permit any of its Subsidiaries or any of its or its Subsidiaries directors, officers, employees, agents or representatives to, directly or indirectly, (i) solicit, initiate or encourage any inquiries or the making of any proposal with respect to any merger, liquidation, recapitalization, consolidation or other business combination involving the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or acquisition of any capital stock or any material portion of the assets of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, or any combination of the foregoing (any such proposal or transaction, other than any such proposal by Parent, Merger Sub or their respective directors, officers, employees, agents and representatives, an "Acquisition Proposal"), (ii) have any discussions with or provide any confidential information or data to any person relating to an Acquisition Proposal, or engage in any negotiations concerning an Acquisition Proposal or (iii) approve or recommend, or propose to approve or recommend, or execute or enter into, any letter of intent, agreement in principle, or agreement to any Acquisition Proposal; _provided_ ,  _however_ , that at any time prior to the Company Meeting the Company may furnish information and hold discussions in respect of any such proposal received that was not solicited or knowingly encouraged by the Company if (x) the Special Committee determines in good faith, following consultation with counsel, that failure to do so would constitute or result in a breach of its fiduciary duties under applicable law and (y) prior to providing any information pursuant to this proviso, the Company shall have entered into a confidentiality agreement with such third party on customary terms. The Company will promptly (within one business day) following receipt of any Acquisition Proposal advise Parent of the substance thereof (including the identity of the person making such Acquisition Proposal), and will keep Parent apprised of any related developments, discussions and negotiations (including the terms and conditions of the Acquisition Proposal) on a current basis (and, in any event, within 48 hours of the occurrence of such developments, discussions or negotiations). For purposes of this Agreement, a "Superior Proposal" means a bona fide written Acquisition Proposal which the Board of Directors of the Company, acting upon the recommendation of the Special Committee (after consultation by such committee with its financial advisors and legal advisors), concludes in good faith, taking into account all legal, financial, regulatory and other aspects of the proposal and the person making the proposal (including any break-up fees, expense reimbursement provisions and conditions to consummation), (i) is more favorable to the stockholders of the Company, from a financial point of view, than the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and (ii) is fully financed or reasonably capable of being fully financed and otherwise reasonably capable of being completed on the terms proposed, without taking into account whether or not Parent would acquiesce to such transaction; provided that, for purposes of this definition of "Superior Proposal," the term "Acquisition Proposal" shall have the meaning assigned to such term in this Section 6.03, except that "Acquisition Proposal" shall only be deemed to refer to a transaction involving the acquisition of a majority of the voting securities of the Company or all or substantially all of the consolidated assets of the Company and its Subsidiaries. 

    ##### 

 

   

 Section 6.04 _Indemnification and Insurance_. (a) Parent and Merger Sub agree that all rights to exculpation, indemnification and advancement of expenses for acts or omissions occurring at or prior to the Effective Time, whether asserted or claimed prior to, at or after the Effective Time, now existing in favor of the current or former directors, officers or employees, as the case may be, of the Company or its Subsidiaries as provided in their respective certificates of incorporation or by-laws or similar organizational documents shall survive the Merger and shall continue in full force and effect. For a period of six (6) years from the Effective Time, Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to maintain in effect any and all exculpation, indemnification and advancement of expenses provisions of the Companys and any of its Subsidiaries certificate of incorporation and by-laws or similar organizational documents in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time or in any indemnification agreements of the Company or its Subsidiaries with any of their respective current or former directors, officers, or employees in effect as of the date hereof (as set forth in Section 6.04(a) of the Company Disclosure Schedule), and shall not amend, repeal or otherwise modify any such provisions in any manner that would adversely affect the rights thereunder of any individuals who at the Effective Time were current or former directors, officers or employees of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries; provided, however, that all rights to indemnification in respect of any Action (as hereinafter defined) pending or asserted or any claim made within such period shall continue until the disposition of such Action or resolution of such claim. 

  

 (b) From and after the Effective Time, Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, to the fullest extent permitted under applicable law, indemnify and hold harmless (and advance funds in respect of each of the foregoing) each current and former director or officer of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries (an "Indemnified Party") against any costs or expenses (including advancing reasonable attorneys fees and expenses in advance of the final disposition of any claim, suit, proceeding or investigation to each Indemnified Party to the fullest extent permitted by law, and upon receipt from an Indemnified Party of any required undertaking), judgments, fines, losses, claims, damages, liabilities and amounts paid in settlement in connection with any actual or threatened claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative (an "Action"), arising out of, relating to or in connection with any action or omission occurring or alleged to have occurred at or before the Effective Time, arising in whole or in part out of or pertaining to the fact that he or she is or was a director or officer of the Company or, while a director or officer of the Company, is or was serving at the request of the Company as a director, officer, trustee or partner of another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust, employee benefit plan or other entity, to the fullest extent which such Indemnified Parties would be entitled under applicable law. 

  

 (c) For a period of six years after the Effective Time, Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to maintain in effect the current policy of directors and officers liability insurance maintained as of the date hereof by the Company (the "Current Policy") (provided that the Surviving Corporation may substitute therefor policies with a substantially equivalent insurer of at least the same coverage and amounts containing terms, including scope of coverage, and conditions which are no less advantageous to the insured) with respect to claims arising from facts or events that existed or occurred at or before the Effective Time. Alternatively, with the prior written consent of Parent, the Company may purchase prior to the Effective Time, and, following the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall maintain, a fully pre-paid six-year "tail" policy to the Current Policy, which tail policy shall cover a period from the Effective Time 

   ##### 

  

    

through and including the date six years after the Closing Date with respect
to claims arising from facts or events that existed or occurred prior to or
at the Effective Time, and which tail policy shall contain the same or
superior coverage (including the scope and amount thereof) as, and
contain terms and conditions that are equivalent or superior to, the coverage
set forth in the Current Policy. 

  

 (d) The rights of each Indemnified Party hereunder shall be in addition to, and not in limitation of, any other rights such Indemnified Party may have under the certificate of incorporation or by-laws or other organizational documents of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or the Surviving Corporation, any other indemnification agreement or arrangement, the DGCL or otherwise. The provisions of this Section 6.04 shall survive the consummation of the Merger and, notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement that may be to the contrary, expressly are intended to benefit, and are enforceable by, each of the Indemnified Parties. 

  

 (e) In the event Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any of their respective successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any other person and shall not be the continuing or surviving corporation or entity in such consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers all or substantially all of its properties and assets to any person, then, and in either such case, proper provision shall be made so that the successors and assigns of Parent or the Surviving Corporation, as the case may be, shall assume the obligations of the Surviving Corporation set forth in this Section 6.04. In the event that the Surviving Corporation is liquidated or dissolved in accordance with applicable laws and regulations, then proper provision shall be made so that Parent shall assume the obligations of the Surviving Corporation set forth in this Section 6.04. Nothing in this Agreement is intended to, shall be construed to or shall release, waive or impair any rights to directors and officers insurance claims under any policy that is or has been in existence with respect to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or their respective officers, directors and employees, it being understood and agreed that the indemnification provided for in this Section 6.04 is not prior to, or in substitution for, any such claims under any such policies. 

  

 Section 6.05 _Notification of Certain Matters_. From and after the date of this Agreement until the Effective Time, each party hereto shall promptly notify the other parties hereto of: 

   

 (a) the receipt of any material notice or other material communication from any person alleging that the consent of such person is or may be required in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby; 

   

 (b) the receipt of any material notice or other material communication from any Governmental Entity in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby; and 

   

 (c) any actions, suits, claims, investigations or proceedings commenced or, to the Knowledge of the party, threatened against Parent, Merger Sub or the Company which seeks to prohibit or prevent consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby; 

 

in each case, to the extent such event or circumstance is or becomes known to
the party required to give such notice; provided, however, that the delivery
of any notice pursuant to this Section 

  ##### 

  

   

6.05 shall not be deemed to be an amendment of this Agreement or any Section
in the Company Disclosure Schedule or the Parent Disclosure Schedule, as the
case may be, and shall not cure any breach of any representation or warranty
requiring disclosure of such matter prior to the date of this Agreement. 

   

 Section 6.06 _Public Announcements_. Prior to the Closing, Parent, Merger Sub and the Company shall not issue any press release or make any public statement with respect to this Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated hereby without the prior consent of the other parties (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed), except as may be required by law or regulation or any listing agreement with the New York Stock Exchange ("NYSE") or the Toronto Stock Exchange, as applicable and, in such case, shall use their reasonable best efforts to consult with all the parties hereto prior to such release or statement being issued. The parties shall agree on the text of a joint press release by which Parent and the Company will announce the execution of this Agreement. 

  

 Section 6.07 _Exchange Act and NYSE Filings_. Unless an exemption shall be expressly applicable, or unless Parent, Merger Sub or the Company, as the case may be, agrees otherwise in writing, Parent, Merger Sub and the Company and their respective affiliates will timely file with the SEC and the NYSE all reports required to be filed pursuant to the rules and regulations of the SEC and NYSE (including all required financial statements). Such reports and other information filed by a party shall, with respect to information contained therein relating to such party and its Subsidiaries, comply in all material respects with all of the requirements of the SEC and NYSE rules and regulations, and when filed, will not include an untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, in either case with respect to information contained therein relating to such party and its Subsidiaries. 

  

 Section 6.08 _Reasonable Best Efforts_. Subject to the terms and conditions hereof, each of the Parent, Merger Sub and the Company will use their reasonable best efforts to take all action necessary and to do all things necessary, proper or desirable, or advisable under applicable laws, so as to permit the consummation of the Merger as promptly as practicable and otherwise to enable the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby. 

  

 Section 6.09 _Performance by Merger Sub_. Parent shall cause Merger Sub to perform its obligations hereunder. 

  

 Section 6.10 _Takeover Statutes_. The Company will take all steps necessary to exempt (or continue the exemption of) the Merger, this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby from, or if necessary challenge the validity or applicability of, any applicable "moratorium", "control share", "fair price" or other anti-takeover laws and regulations of any state or, upon the reasonable request of Parent, any non-U.S. jurisdiction, as now or hereafter in effect. 

  

 Section 6.11 _Employee Benefits_. (a) From the Effective Time until December 31, 2008, Parent shall provide, or shall cause to be provided, to all employees of the Company and its Subsidiaries as of the Effective Time (the "Continuing Employees") compensation and 

   ##### 

  

    

employee benefit plans, programs and arrangements that are, in the aggregate,
no less favorable than those generally provided to such employees immediately
prior to the Effective Time, excluding any benefits provided pursuant to the
ESPP. 

  

 (b) Parent shall honor, or cause to be honored, in accordance with their terms, all benefit obligations to, and contractual rights of, current and former employees and directors of the Company and its Subsidiaries under the Company Benefit Plans. 

   

 (c) From and after the Effective Time, Parent shall cause each compensation and/or benefit plan, program, agreement or arrangement in which Continuing Employees are eligible to participate after the Effective Time to take into account for purposes of eligibility, vesting and benefit accruals the service of such Continuing Employees with the Company and its Subsidiaries (and any predecessor entities) prior to the Effective Time to the same extent as such service was credited generally for such purpose by the Company and its Subsidiaries; provided that (i) service credit for benefit accruals shall not be applicable to any defined benefit plan, other than any Company Benefit Plan as in effect on the date hereof, and (ii) nothing herein shall require or result in the duplication of benefits provided to any such Continuing Employees. 

   

 (d) Except as otherwise provided in this Section 6.11, nothing contained in this Section 6.11 shall be interpreted as preventing Parent from (i) amending, modifying or terminating any Company Benefit Plan or any other contract, agreement or commitment of the Company in accordance with its terms and applicable law or (ii) terminating the employment of any Continuing Employee following the Effective Time, with benefits provided in accordance with the terms of any relevant benefit plans. 

   

 (e) The provisions of Section 6.11 are for the sole benefit of the parties to this Agreement and nothing herein, expressed or implied, is intended or shall be construed to confer upon or give to any person (including employees of the Company), other than the parties hereto and their permitted successors and assigns, any legal or equitable or other rights or remedies (with respect to matters provided for in this Section 6.11) under or by reason of any provision of this Agreement. 

   

 Section 6.12 _Stockholders Agreement_. The Stockholders Agreement shall terminate and be of no further force or effect upon the Effective Time, without the need for any action or writing by any party thereto.

 (d) The symbol "$" and the word "dollar" or "dollars" shall refer to the lawful currency of the United States of America. 

  

 (e) Whenever the words "include," "includes" or "including" are used in this Agreement, they shall be deemed to be followed by the words "without limitation." A reference in this Agreement to any statute shall be to such statute as amended from time to time, and to the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder. 

  

 Section 9.05 _Accounting Terms_. All accounting terms used herein which are not expressly defined in this Agreement shall have the respective meanings given to them in accordance with GAAP. 

    ##### 

  

   

 Section 9.06 _Severability_. If any term or other provision of this Agreement is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced by any rule of law, or public policy, all other conditions and provisions of this Agreement shall nevertheless remain in full force and effect so long as the major economic or legal substance of the Merger is not affected in any manner materially adverse to any party. Upon such determination that any term or other provision is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced, the parties hereto shall negotiate in good faith to modify this Agreement so as to effect the original intent of the parties as closely as possible in a mutually acceptable manner in order that the Merger be consummated as originally contemplated to the fullest extent possible. 

  

 Section 9.07 _Entire Agreement; Assignment_. This Agreement (including the Parent Disclosure Schedule and the Company Disclosure Schedule, which are hereby incorporated herein and made a part hereof for all purposes as if fully set forth herein) and the Stockholders Agreement constitute the entire agreement among the parties with respect to the subject matter hereof and supersedes all prior agreements and undertakings, both written and oral, among the parties, or any of them, with respect to the subject matter hereof. This Agreement shall not be assigned by operation of law or otherwise without the prior written consent of the other parties, which shall not be unreasonably withheld, except that Merger Sub may assign all or any of its rights and obligations hereunder to any wholly owned subsidiary of Parent or Merger Sub; provided, that no such assignment shall change the amount or nature of the Merger Consideration or relieve the assigning party of its obligations hereunder if such assignee does not perform such obligations. 

  

 Section 9.08 _Parties in Interest_. This Agreement shall be binding upon and inure solely to the benefit of each party hereto, and nothing in this Agreement, express or implied, is intended to or shall confer upon any other person any right, benefit or remedy of any nature whatsoever under or by reason of this Agreement, other than Section 6.04 (which is intended to be for the benefit of the persons covered thereby and the respective heirs, executors and administrators of such persons and may be enforced by such persons). 

  

 Section 9.09 _Governing Law; Consent to Jurisdiction_. (a) This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Delaware applicable to contracts made and to be performed entirely in such State. Each of the parties hereto hereby irrevocably and unconditionally consents to submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware located in New Castle County and the courts of the United States of America located in the District of Delaware, for any action, proceeding or investigation in any court or before any Governmental Entity ("Litigation") arising out of or relating to this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby. Each of the parties hereto hereby irrevocably and unconditionally waives, and agrees not to assert, by way of motion, as a defense, counterclaim or otherwise, in any such Litigation, the defense of sovereign immunity, any claim that it is not personally subject to the jurisdiction of the aforesaid courts for any reason other than the failure to serve process in accordance with this Section 9.09, that it or its property is exempt or immune from jurisdiction of any such court or from any legal process commenced in such courts (whether through service of notice, attachment prior to judgment, attachment in aid of execution of judgment, execution of judgment or otherwise), and to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, that the Litigation in any such court is brought in an inconvenient forum, that the venue of such Litigation is improper, or that this Agreement, or the subject matter hereof, 

   ##### 

  

    

may not be enforced in or by such courts and further irrevocably waives, to
the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, the benefit of any defense
that would hinder, fetter or delay the levy, execution or collection of any
amount to which the party is entitled pursuant to the final judgment of any
court having jurisdiction. Each of the parties irrevocably
and unconditionally waives, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable
law, any and all rights to trial by jury in connection with any Litigation
arising out of or relating to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated
hereby. 

  

 (b) Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing in this Agreement shall be deemed consent by any party to jurisdiction in any litigation initiated, or service of process, by any person who is not a party hereto. 

  

 Section 9.10 _WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL_. EACH OF THE PARTIES HERETO IRREVOCABLY WAIVES ANY AND ALL RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY LEGAL PROCEEDING BETWEEN THE PARTIES HERETO ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY. 

  

 Section 9.11 _Headings_. The descriptive headings contained in this Agreement are included for convenience of reference only and shall not affect in any way the meaning or interpretation of this Agreement. 

  

 Section 9.12 _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed and delivered (including by facsimile transmission) in one or more counterparts, and by the different parties hereto in separate counterparts, each of which when executed and delivered shall be deemed to be an original but all of which taken together shall constitute one and the same agreement. 

  

 Section 9.13 _Construction_. This Agreement and any documents or instruments delivered pursuant hereto or in connection herewith shall be construed without regard to the identity of the person who drafted the various provisions of the same. Each and every provision of this Agreement and such other documents and instruments shall be construed as though all of the parties participated equally in the drafting of the same. Consequently, the parties acknowledge and agree that any rule of construction that a document is to be construed against the drafting party shall not be applicable either to this Agreement or such other documents and instruments. 

   ##### 

  

 

IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the Company, Parent and Merger Sub have caused this
Agreement to be executed by their respective officers thereunto duly
authorized as of the date first above written.
