Acquisition Proposal, or engage in any negotiations concerning an Acquisition Proposal or (iii)
approve or recommend, or propose to approve or recommend, or execute or enter into, any letter of
intent, agreement in principle, or agreement to any Acquisition Proposal; <U>provided</U>,
<U>however</U>, that at any time prior to the Company Meeting the Company may furnish information
and hold discussions in respect of any such proposal received that was not solicited or knowingly
encouraged by the Company if (x)&nbsp;the Special Committee determines in good faith, following
consultation with counsel, that failure to
do so would constitute or result in a breach of its fiduciary duties under applicable law and
(y)&nbsp;prior to providing any information pursuant to this proviso, the Company shall have entered
into a confidentiality agreement with such third party on customary terms. The Company will
promptly (within one business day) following receipt of any Acquisition Proposal advise Parent of
the substance thereof (including the identity of the person making such Acquisition Proposal), and
will keep Parent apprised of any related developments, discussions and negotiations (including the
terms and conditions of the Acquisition Proposal) on a current basis (and, in any event, within 48
hours of the occurrence of such developments, discussions or negotiations). For purposes of this
Agreement, a &#147;Superior Proposal&#148; means a bona fide written Acquisition Proposal which the Board of
Directors of the Company, acting upon the recommendation of the Special Committee (after
consultation by such committee with its financial advisors and legal advisors), concludes in good
faith, taking into account all legal, financial, regulatory and other aspects of the proposal and
the person making the proposal (including any break-up fees, expense reimbursement provisions and
conditions to consummation), (i)&nbsp;is more favorable to the stockholders of the Company, from a
financial point of view, than the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and (ii)&nbsp;is fully
financed or reasonably capable of being fully financed and otherwise reasonably capable of being
completed on the terms proposed, without taking into account whether or not Parent would acquiesce
to such transaction; provided that, for purposes of this definition of &#147;Superior Proposal,&#148; the
term &#147;Acquisition Proposal&#148; shall have the meaning assigned to such term in this Section&nbsp;6.03,
except that &#147;Acquisition Proposal&#148; shall only be deemed to refer to a transaction involving the
acquisition of a majority of the voting securities of the Company or all or substantially all of
the consolidated assets of the Company and its Subsidiaries.
