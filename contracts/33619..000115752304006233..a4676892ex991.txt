from and against any and all damages, actions, proceedings, demands,
liabilities, losses, taxes, fines, penalties, costs, claims and expenses

the Escrow Agent shall release and deliver to the Shareholder Representative
for distribution to the Stockholders a portion of the Escrow Amount equal to
the Escrow Amount at such time, if any, less the amount of any pending
indemnification claims properly made by a Purchaser Indemnified

Agent shall release and deliver to the Shareholder Representative for
distribution to the Stockholders the remaining portion of the Escrow Amount

remaining from the amounts reserved for such claims. All amounts delivered to
the Shareholder Representative by the Escrow Agent for distribution to the

and   (e) pay to officers, directors or employees of the Company or
any Subsidiary any amounts that are due upon the Closing Date as success

less any such amounts which are subject to Stockholder vote pursuant to
Section 6.08 hereof and are not approved by the Stockholders, as set forth on
Exhibit 3.05(e) hereto (the "Success Payments").   SECTION 3.06 Final Net
Working Capital Payments.   (a) As soon as is reasonably practicable, (i)
the Surviving Corporation shall cause Deloitte and Touche LLP, at the Surviving
Corporation\'s expense, to perform an audit of the   -16-   special
purpose balance sheet of the Company and the Subsidiaries as of the Closing
Date, including consolidating balance sheets for each Subsidiary
(the "Closing Date Balance Sheet"), prepared on a basis consistent with
the consolidated balance sheet of the Company as of the Valuation Date,
provided, that any monetary amount in a currency other than Dollars shall be
translated into Dollars using the Valuation Date Exchange Rate and (ii) not
later than sixty (60) days following the Closing Date, the Parent shall
provide the Shareholder Representative with a copy of the Closing Date
Balance Sheet, accompanied by the report of Deloitte and Touche LLP stating
that the Closing Date Balance Sheet was prepared on a basis consistent with
the balance sheet of the Company as of the Valuation Date, provided, that any
monetary amount in a currency other than Dollars shall be translated into
Dollars using the Valuation Date Exchange Rate. The Closing Date Balance
Sheet provided to the Shareholder Representative shall be accompanied by
consolidating balance sheets for each Subsidiary and by detailed schedules
setting forth the Net Working Capital of the Company as of the Closing Date
(the "Final Net Working Capital"), as reflected in the Closing Date Balance
Sheet and as calculated in accordance with Exhibit 1.01. The Parent shall, at
the Shareholder Representative\'s request, provide the Shareholder
Representative and his representatives access at all reasonable times to the
Surviving Corporation\'s and the Company\'s accountants, personnel,
properties, books and records, work papers, schedules and calculations
relating to the Closing Date Balance Sheet and the Final Net Working Capital.
On or before the thirtieth (30th) day following the
Shareholder Representative\'s receipt of the Closing Date Balance Sheet and
such detailed schedules (the "Balance Sheet Review Period"), the Shareholder
Representative shall be required to notify the Parent and the Surviving
Corporation in writing of any disputed items with respect to the Closing Date
Balance Sheet or the Final Net Working Capital. If the Parent or the
Surviving Corporation receives such notice on or before the last day of the
Balance Sheet Review Period (the "Dispute Notice"), the Parent and the
Surviving Corporation shall negotiate with the Shareholder Representative in
good faith to resolve such dispute, such negotiation to begin as soon as
practicable (but in any case, no later than thirty (30) days) after the
Shareholder Representative has provided the Dispute Notice; provided,
however, that any and all amounts not then in dispute as set forth in the
Dispute Notice shall be paid promptly by the owing party hereto.   (b) Any
dispute arising from the Closing Date Balance Sheet and the calculation of
the Final Net Working Capital of the Company that cannot be resolved within
such thirty (30) day period shall be submitted to a mutually agreed upon
accounting firm of recognized national standing (the "Financial Expert")
within five (5) days following the expiration of such thirty (30) day period.
The Financial Expert shall resolve all such items in dispute within thirty
(30) days after the Financial Expert has been given such dispute to resolve.
The decision of the Financial Expert shall be final and binding on
the parties hereto. Within five (5) days of the resolution of such dispute
(whether by agreement between the parties or as a result of a decision by the
Financial Expert) the Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to make
any required adjustments to the Closing Date Balance Sheet and the
calculation of the Final Net Working Capital and such adjusted Closing Date
Balance Sheet and the calculation of the Final Net Working Capital shall be
final and binding on the parties hereto.   If the Dispute Notice sets forth
a definitive figure for the Final Net Working Capital, as determined by the
Shareholder Representative, and the Final Net Working Capital, as determined
by the Financial Expert is greater than or equal to the figure determined by
the Shareholder Representative, all fees and expenses of the Financial Expert
shall be borne by the Parent.   -17-    If the Dispute Notice sets forth
a definitive figure for the Final Net Working Capital, as determined by the
Shareholder Representative, and the Final Net Working Capital, as determined
by the Financial Expert is less than or equal to the figure determined by the
Surviving Corporation, all fees and expenses of the Financial Expert shall be
borne by the Shareholder Representative.   If the Dispute Notice sets forth
a definitive figure for the Final Net Working Capital, as determined by the
Shareholder Representative, and the Final Net Working Capital, as determined
by the Financial Expert, is greater than the figure determined by the
Surviving Corporation but less than the figure determined by the Shareholder
Representative, the fees and expenses of the Financial Expert shall be shared
by the Shareholder Representative and the Parent in proportion to the amount
by which the Financial Expert\'s figure differed from the figure calculated
by the Shareholder Representative and the Surviving Corporation,
respectively. By way of example only, if the Final Net Working Capital, as
determined by the Surviving Corporation is Ten Dollars ($10), and the Final
Net Working Capital, as determined by the Shareholder Representative is
Twenty Dollars ($20) and the Final Net Working Capital, as determined by the
Financial Expert is Seventeen Dollars ($17), the Shareholder Representative
would bear Thirty Percent (30%) of the fees and expenses of the Financial
Expert and the Parent would bear the remainder of such fees and expenses.  
If the Dispute Notice does not set forth a definitive figure for the
Final Net Working Capital, as determined by the Shareholder Representative,
the fees and expenses of the Financial Expert shall be allocated between the
Shareholder Representative and the Parent by the Financial Expert in
accordance with the principles set forth in the foregoing three (3)
paragraphs.   (c) If the Final Net Working Capital is greater than the
Estimated Final Net Working Capital, then the Parent shall cause the
Surviving Corporation to pay the amount of such excess net of any Appraisal
Consideration, to the Shareholder Representative for distribution to the
Stockholders in cash (the "Post-Closing Net Working Capital Upward
Adjustment").   (d) If the Final Net Working Capital is less than the
Estimated Final Net Working Capital, then the Escrow Agent shall pay the
amount of such shortfall to the Parent from the Escrow Amount.   (e) Any
payment to the Parent or the Shareholder Representative, as the case may be,
based on the Final Net Working Capital shall be made within ten (10) business
days following agreement on or final determination of the Closing Date
Balance Sheet and the Final Net Working Capital. If a payment due under this
subsection (e) is not made within such ten (10) business day period, interest
shall accrue on such unpaid amounts at a rate of twelve percent (12%) per
annum. Any Post-Closing Net Working Capital Upward Adjustment paid to
the Shareholder Representative for distribution to the Stockholders shall
be Post-Closing Merger Consideration and allocated by the
Shareholder Representative among the Stockholders pro rata in accordance with
Section 3.02(a).   -18-    SECTION 3.07 Surrender of Shares.   (a)
Pursuant to Section 3.05, the Parent, the Intermediate Parent or the
Purchaser shall pay to the Shareholder Representative on the Closing Date,
for the benefit of the Stockholders, the Closing Merger Consideration,
in immediately available funds to the account designated by the
Shareholder Representative or his designee. Each Stockholder whose Shares
were converted pursuant to Section 3.02(a) or who are deemed to be
Stockholders who have consented to the Merger pursuant to Section 3.03 shall
thereafter surrender to the Shareholder Representative or his designee the
certificate representing such Shares or an Affidavit of Lost Certificate.
Upon the delivery of such certificate or Affidavit of Lost Certificate, the
Shareholder Representative shall pay to the holder of such Shares in exchange
therefor the amount due such holder as set forth in Section 3.02(a) by check
or wire transfer to the account designated in writing by such holder subject
to subsection (e) below.   (b) Prior to each distribution of Merger
Consideration the Shareholder Representative shall pay or set aside and
reserve that amount which the Shareholder Representative determines in his
sole opinion is or may be required to meet Estimated Future Expenses. In the
event the amount of such reserve exceeds Actual Future Expenses, the
Shareholder Representative shall distribute the excess to those Stockholders
entitled to receive Merger Consideration on a pro rata basis in accordance
with Section 3.02(a), at the times determined by the Shareholder
Representative in his sole opinion, and such amounts shall be deemed to be
Post-Closing Merger Consideration. In no event shall the Shareholder
Representative, the Parent, the Intermediate Parent or the Surviving
Corporation be liable for Actual Future Expenses.   (c) In the event that
appraisal and payment rights with respect to the Dissenting Shares are duly
exercised pursuant to Section 262 of the DGCL:   (i) the Shareholder
Representative shall promptly deliver to the Surviving Corporation that
portion of the Merger Consideration (whether received as Closing Merger
Consideration or Post-Closing Merger Consideration) which is equal to the
product of (i) the percentage of the Shares outstanding at Closing
represented by the Dissenting Shares (the "Appraisal Percentage") and (ii)
the Merger Consideration;   (ii) in the event that the Shareholder
Representative is entitled to receive Post-Closing Merger Consideration from
the Parent from time to time, the Parent shall be entitled to withhold the
portion of such consideration that is equal to the product of (i) the
Appraisal Percentage and (ii) such consideration, if any; and   (iii) if
the Post-Closing Merger Consideration is received from a third party,
including from the Escrow Agent, the Shareholder Representative shall
promptly deliver to the Surviving Corporation the portion of such
consideration that is equal to the product of (i) the Appraisal Percentage
and (ii) such consideration, if any;  (any amounts delivered or withheld
pursuant to subsections (c)(i), (c)(ii) and (c)(iii) collectively referred to
hereinafter as the "Appraisal Consideration").   -19-    The Surviving
Corporation shall be solely responsible for payment of all amounts in the
event that appraisal and payment rights with respect to the Dissenting Shares
are duly exercised pursuant to Section 262 of the DGCL (including amounts in
excess of the Appraisal Consideration) and shall indemnify  the Shareholder
Representative and the Stockholders and hold the Shareholder Representative
and the Stockholders harmless from and against any and all Losses relating
to, or arising as a result of a claim by, Dissenting Stockholders.   (d) At
the Closing Date, the stock transfer books of the Company shall be closed and
there shall not be any further registration of transfers of any Shares
thereafter on the records of the Company. From and after the Effective Time,
the holders of certificates evidencing ownership of Shares immediately prior
to the Effective Time shall cease to have any rights with respect to such
Shares, except as otherwise provided for herein or by applicable law. If,
after the Effective Time and through the eighteen (18) month anniversary of
the Effective Time, certificates of the Company or Affidavits of Lost
Certificates therefore are presented to the Surviving Corporation, they shall
be delivered to the Shareholder Representative and canceled and exchanged for
any cash payment due from the Shareholder Representative as provided in
this Section 3.07. No Stockholder shall be entitled to receive interest on
any cash payable upon the surrender of certificates representing Shares or
the execution and delivery of Affidavits of Lost Certificates.   (e) If any
Stockholder (except any Dissenting Stockholder) fails to surrender and
exchange certificate(s) evidencing such Shares by the eighteen (18) month
anniversary of the Effective Time, the Shareholder Representative shall
deliver to the Surviving Corporation that portion of the Merger Consideration
(including any interest received with respect thereto) which had been
delivered to the Shareholder Representative for disbursement to such holders,
and thereafter such holders shall only be entitled to look to the Surviving
Corporation as general creditors thereof (subject to abandoned property,
escheat or similar laws) to receive amounts payable upon due surrender of the
certificates representing their Shares or the execution and delivery
of Affidavits of Lost Certificates, and shall not be entitled to receive
any interest thereon. Notwithstanding the foregoing, neither the
Surviving Corporation nor the Shareholder Representative shall be liable to
any Stockholder for amounts to which such Stockholder is entitled under
Section 3.02(a) which have been delivered to a public official pursuant to
the requirements of applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar
law.   SECTION 3.08 Tax Withholding. The Parent, the Intermediate Parent or
the Purchaser, as the case may be, shall be entitled to deduct and
withhold from the consideration otherwise payable with respect to any
Stockholder pursuant to this Agreement (including, without limitation, any
amount paid to the Shareholder Representative for the benefit of any
Stockholder) such amounts that the Parent, the Intermediate Parent or the
Purchaser, as the case may be, may be required to deduct and withhold with
respect to the making of such payment under any provision of law. If the
Parent, the Intermediate Parent or the Purchaser, as the case may be,
withholds any such amounts, such amounts shall be treated for all purposes of
this Agreement as having been paid to the Stockholder in respect of which the
Parent, the Intermediate Parent or the Purchaser, as the case may be, made
such deduction and withholding. On or prior to the Closing Date, the
Shareholder Representative shall provide the Parent with any information
reasonably requested by the Parent in writing regarding the exercise or
cancellation of any Option for which the full amount of withholding taxes has
not been paid in cash by the holder of such Option, including,
without limitation, the method of exercise and the number of Shares issued
(or deemed issued) to such Option holder.   -20-    ARTICLE 4.

of business;   (j) other than in the ordinary course of business and
consistent with past practice of the Company or any Subsidiary, grant of any
increase in the compensation of officers, directors, employees or consultants
of the Company or any Subsidiary;   (k) any (i) borrowing of funds,

since the date of the Financial Statements; or   (m) any agreement or

a complete and accurate list of all of the employees of the Company and
the Subsidiaries (with the exception of LIESA, LRE, LIUK and LIG) as of the
date indicated thereon (which date shall be not more than thirty (30) days
prior to the date of this Agreement) (including each employee on leave of
absence or layoff status), including such employee\'s name, job title,
current compensation, a list of any written employment agreement to which he
or she is a party and the nature of such employee\'s participation in any
Plans. With respect to LIESA, LRE, LIUK and LIG, Schedule 4.08 sets forth
salary ranges and the nature of participation in any Plans per the employee
categories specified in Schedule 4.08 for each of these Subsidiaries as of
the date indicated thereon (which date shall be not more than thirty (30)
days prior to the date of this Agreement). Except as set forth in Schedule
4.08, neither the Company nor any Subsidiary has any oral or written
employment agreement or arrangements with any Person.   SECTION 4.09 Sales
Representatives, Dealers and Distributors. Except as set forth in Schedule
4.09 and as of the date indicated thereon (which date shall be no more than
thirty (30) days prior to the date of this Agreement), neither the Company
nor any Subsidiary is a party to any contract or agreement with any Person
under which such other Person is a sales agent, representative, dealer or
distributor of any of the products or services of the Company or of any
Subsidiary (collectively the "Sales Representative Agreements"), as the case
may be, which by its terms either (i) cannot be terminated on less than
ninety (90) days prior notice or (ii) requires an additional payment as a
result of termination, and there has been no change in the rate of
compensation paid or payable to any such Person since March 31, 2004, other
than in the ordinary course of business and consistent with past practice of
the Company or any Subsidiary. The parties acknowledge and agree that
applicable local law may require additional notice or termination
payments that are not reflected in the terms of the Sales Representative
Agreements, and no such requirement, nor the failure to disclose such
requirement on Schedule 4.09, shall result in a breach of this Section
4.09.   SECTION 4.10 Brokers. Except for Wachovia Capital Markets, LLC,
no broker, finder or investment bank is entitled to any brokerage, finder\'s
or other fee or commission in connection with the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement based upon arrangements made by or on behalf of the
Company.   SECTION 4.11 Litigation. Except as set forth in Schedule
4.11, there is no action, suit, notice of violation, proceeding or
investigation pending or, to the knowledge of the Company, threatened against
the Company or any Subsidiary before or by any Governmental Authority that
(i) relates to or challenges the legality, validity or enforceability of this
Agreement,   -25-   (ii) could reasonably be expected to have,
individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect, or (iii) could,
individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to impair the
ability of the Company to perform on a timely basis its obligations under
this Agreement. To the knowledge of the Company, there is no valid basis for
any claim described in the preceding sentence. Except as set forth on
Schedule 4.11, as of the date hereof, neither the Company nor any Subsidiary
is subject to any outstanding Governmental Order.   SECTION 4.12 Title to
Properties. Except as set forth on Schedule 4.12, each of the Company and the
Subsidiaries has good and marketable title, free and clear of all Liens, to
its respective owned personal property and assets (other than the Real
Property and Leases which are addressed in Section 4.26) shown on the March
31 Balance Sheet or acquired after March 31, 2004, except for (i) assets that
have been disposed of since March 31, 2004 in the ordinary course of business
and (ii) Liens reflected in the March 31 Balance Sheet.   SECTION 4.13
Personal Property Leases. Except as set forth in Schedule 4.13, all of the
personal property leased to the Company or the Subsidiaries are subject to
leases which are valid and in full force and effect assuming due
authorization, execution and delivery by the counterparties to such leases,
and to the knowledge of the Company no event has occurred which, with notice
or lapse of time or both, would constitute a material default under any of
these leases.   SECTION 4.14 Inventory. The inventories of items shown on
the March 31 Balance Sheet and any other inventory acquired by the Company or
the Subsidiaries, respectively, since the date thereof, up to but not
including the date of this Agreement, consist of items of a quality, quantity

Company or by the Subsidiaries, except for all obsolete, unusable, not
readily salable or below-standard quality items, all of which have been
either written-off or written down to net realizable value or for which
adequate reserves have been established in the March 31 Balance Sheet or on
the books of the Company or the Subsidiaries, as the case may be, all in

Balance Sheet are the property of the Company or of the Subsidiaries, as the
case may be, free and clear of all Liens, except for items sold in the
ordinary course of business since March 31, 2004, and for each of these sales
either the purchaser of the items has made full payment therefor or the
purchaser\'s liability to make payment is reflected in the books of the
Company or the Subsidiary, as the case may be. Except as set forth on
Schedule 4.14, all items included in the inventories have been priced at cost
on a first-in, first-out basis in accordance with the established practice of
the Company for at least the two (2) most recent fiscal years. Except as set
forth in Schedule 4.14 or the March 31 Balance Sheet, no items included in
the inventories on the March 31 Balance Sheet have been pledged
as collateral, held by the Company or by the Subsidiaries on consignment
from others or otherwise subject to any Liens. Except as set forth on
Schedule 4.14, the Company has no knowledge of any condition which as of the
date of this Agreement is adversely affecting the quality or supply of raw
materials, intermediates, supplies, parts and other materials available to
the Company and the Subsidiaries that are necessary to manufacture, package
or label the Company\'s or Subsidiaries\' products or are otherwise used in
the Business, except for any adverse conditions that could not reasonably be
expected to have a Material Adverse Effect.   -26-    SECTION 4.15
Customers. Schedule 4.15 sets forth a complete and current list of each
customer of any of LRE, LIESA or LIC that accounted for more than five
percent (5%) of the gross revenues of such company for the fiscal year ended
March 31, 2004 (including for this purpose, sales of any Subsidiary of such
companies, except that gross revenues and customers of LIESA are not included
as part of LIC\'s gross revenues or customers). To the knowledge of
the Company, except as indicated in Schedule 4.15, none of these customers
intends to cease doing business or materially and adversely modify its
business relationship with the Company or any of the Subsidiaries.  
SECTION 4.16 Contracts.   (a) Schedule 4.16 sets forth a true and complete
list as of the date indicated thereon (which date shall be no more than
thirty (30) days prior to the date of this Agreement) of any agreement, other
than the Leases, Credit Agreements and intercompany contracts to which the
Company or any Subsidiary is a party or by which the Company or the
Subsidiaries or any of their respective assets or properties are bound, which
requires future payments to or from either or any of them in excess of either
(i) Two Hundred and Fifty Thousand Dollars ($250,000) per annum or (ii) Two
Hundred Thousand Euros ((euro)200,000) per annum, as the case may be, and
which by its terms either (i) cannot be terminated by the Company or a
Subsidiary on less than ninety (90) days prior notice or (ii) requires an
additional payment as a result of termination ("Material Contracts"). The
Company has provided true and correct copies of each of the Material
Contracts to the Purchaser except purchase orders, which have not been so
provided. Related purchase orders between the Company or any Subsidiary and
the same third party which have been issued under the same contract will be
aggregated for purposes of determining whether the Material Contract
threshold has been satisfied.   (b) To the knowledge of the Company, all
Material Contracts are valid, binding and enforceable in accordance with
their terms against each party thereto and are in full force and effect.
Other than as set forth on Schedule 4.16, neither the Company nor any
Subsidiary is in violation or in default of, or has failed to perform any
material obligation under, any Material Contract, and nothing has occurred
and is continuing that with lapse of time or the giving of notice or both
would constitute a breach or default of a Material Contract by the Company or
the Subsidiaries. To the knowledge of the Company, no material breach or
default by any other party to any such Material Contract of any provision
thereof, nor any condition or event that, with notice or lapse of time or
both, would constitute such a breach or default, has occurred and
is continuing.   (c) Except as set forth on Schedule 4.16, neither the
Company nor any Subsidiary has any powers of attorney outstanding (other than
those issued in the ordinary course of business (i) with respect to Tax or
Intellectual Property matters, (ii) that are customary in connection with
customs and export and import matters, or (iii) that are customary in Germany
with respect to LRE or LIG).   SECTION 4.17 Permits. Schedule 4.17 lists
all material Permits issued to the Company and the Subsidiaries which are in
effect and the Permits listed on such schedule constitute all of the material
Permits required as of the date hereof for the Company and the Subsidiaries
to conduct the Business as currently conducted. There are no defaults
existing under such Permits and neither the Company nor any Subsidiary has
received any notice nor does the Company have any knowledge that the issuer
of any such Permit intends to suspend, withdraw, limit in any form or
terminate any such Permit.   -27-    SECTION 4.18 Accounts Receivable.
All accounts receivable (the "Receivables") of the Company and of the
Subsidiaries reflected on the March 31 Balance Sheet and those incurred
thereafter represent amounts due for services performed or sales actually
made by the Company and the Subsidiaries. Except as set forth in Schedule
4.18 and as of the date indicated thereon (which date shall be no more than
thirty (30) days prior to the date of this Agreement), there are no
individual Receivables which are more than sixty (60) days past due. Except
as set forth in Schedule 4.18 or as disclosed in the March 31 Balance Sheet,
no agreement for deduction, free goods, discount or other deferred price or
quantity adjustment has been made with respect to any such Receivables. The
bad debt reserves and allowances reflected in the Financial Statements are

licenses related to the foregoing.   (b) The Company and the Subsidiaries
own, or are licensed, authorized, or, to the knowledge of the Company,
otherwise possess legally enforceable rights to use the Company IP. To the
knowledge of the Company, and except as set forth on Schedule 4.20, no other

LRE or LIG because the Company has determined that such agreements are not
required under applicable law). The manufacture, use, importation, sale or
offer to sell in the United States of any medical device currently produced

any applications therefor, inventions, formulae, research and development,
technical notes, technical information, technology, know-how, trade secrets,
inventory, products, ideas, algorithms, processes, methods, computer software
programs or applications (other than commercially available software programs
or applications), and tangible or intangible proprietary information or
material (collectively the "Intellectual Property") owned or licensed by the
Company and the Subsidiaries pursuant to an exclusive license agreement and
used in the Business is not being infringed by any third party. To the
knowledge of the Company, the conduct of the Business as currently conducted
does not conflict with or infringe in any way on any Intellectual Property of
any third party. Except as set forth on Schedule 4.20, there is no claim,
suit, action or proceeding pending or, to the knowledge of the
Company, threatened against the Company or the Subsidiaries (A) alleging any
such conflict or infringement with any third party\'s Intellectual Property,
or (B) challenging the ownership, use, license, validity or enforceability of
the Company IP.   (e) To the knowledge of the Company, neither the Company
nor the Subsidiaries is, nor will it be as a result of the execution and
delivery of this Agreement or the performance of its obligations under this
Agreement, in breach of any license, sublicense or other agreement relating
to the Company IP.   SECTION 4.21 Tax Matters. Except as set forth in

that such Persons were required to file, and such Tax Returns are true,
correct and complete in all material respects. All Taxes due and owing by the
Company and the Subsidiaries (whether or not reflected on any Tax Return)
have been paid. The Company and each Subsidiary has duly and timely withheld
from employee salaries, or wages or other compensation (whether or not paid
in cash) and other amounts paid to creditors, independent contractors and
other third parties and paid over to the appropriate Governmental Authority
all amounts required to be so withheld and paid over for all periods under
all applicable Tax or other laws.   -30-    (b) No audits are pending
with regard to any Taxes or Tax Returns of the Company or the Subsidiaries
and there are no outstanding deficiencies or assessments asserted in writing
by any Tax Authority. The Company has provided to the Parent correct and
complete copies of all income Tax Returns of the Company and each Subsidiary
for which the statute of limitations has not expired, and all examination
reports and statements of deficiencies assessed against or agreed to by the
Company or any Subsidiary.   (c) There are no outstanding agreements,

taxable period in which the Company or any Subsidiary incurred a net
operating loss. No net operating loss of the Company or any Subsidiary
relates to a separate return limitation year within the meaning of Treasury
Regulations Section 1.1502-1(f). Schedule 4.21(g) sets forth the amount of
any net operating loss, unused foreign tax credit or excess charitable
contribution allocable to the Company and each Subsidiary for taxable periods
ending on or prior to March 31, 2003 and provides the Company\'s reasonable
estimate of each such item for taxable periods ending March 31, 2004.   (h)
Neither the Company nor any Subsidiary (A) has been a member of any
affiliated group within the meaning of Code Section 1504 of the Code (or
any similar group defined under a similar provision of state or local law)

Tax Returns that the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is or may be subject
to taxation by such jurisdiction.   -31-    (i) Neither the Company nor
any Subsidiary has made any payment or payments, is obligated to make any
payment or payments, nor is a party to (or participating employer in) any
agreement or employee benefit plan that could obligate it or Purchaser to
make any payment or payments, either (i) to a U.S. citizen or U.S. resident
taxpayer or (ii) for services rendered in the U.S., as a result of the
consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement that would
constitute an "excess parachute payment," as defined in Section 280G of the
Code (or any comparable provisions of state, foreign or local law).   (j)
Neither the Company nor any Subsidiary has a permanent establishment in any
country other than the country under the laws of which the Company or such
Subsidiary was formed, as defined in any applicable Tax treaty or
convention.   (k) Schedule 4.21(k) sets forth the classification (i.e., as
a corporation, partnership or disregarded entity) under Treasury
Regulations Section 301.7701-3 of each foreign Subsidiary and provides the
effective date of any election filed pursuant to such section.   (l)
Neither the Company nor any Subsidiary has participated in or cooperated with
an international boycott within the meaning of Section 999 of the Code.

this Section 4.21, (i) any reference to the Company or any Subsidiary shall
include a reference to any entity that is a predecessor to or has been
liquidated or merged into the Company or such Subsidiary and (ii) except with
respect to subsections (c), (e), (g) and (m), all representations relate to
periods of time for which the applicable statute of limitations has not yet
expired.   SECTION 4.22 Employment Matters. Except as set forth on
Schedule 4.22, neither the Company nor any Subsidiary is currently
experiencing or has experienced any material strikes, collective labor
grievances or other collective bargaining disputes in the last five (5)
years. Schedule 4.22 sets forth a list of all of the collective bargaining
agreements to which the Company and/or the Subsidiaries are a party. The
Company and the Subsidiaries have delivered, or caused to be delivered, to
the Purchaser true and complete copies of each of the collective bargaining
agreements described in Schedule 4.22. To the knowledge of the Company, there

Subsidiaries. The Company and the Subsidiaries have each complied with all
applicable laws relating to employment, employment discrimination and
employment practices, including wage and hours regulations, laws relating to
equal opportunity, workplace safety, workers\' compensation and similar laws,
except where the failure(s) to so comply could not reasonably be expected to
result in claims, penalties, fees or other liabilities, individually or in
the aggregate, in excess of One Hundred Thousand Dollars ($100,000).  
-32-   SECTION 4.23 Employee Benefit Matters.   (a) Schedule 4.23(a)(i)

benefit plans, programs or arrangements (i) sponsored, maintained or
contributed to by the Company or any Subsidiary or to which the Company or
any Subsidiary is a party or (ii) with respect to which the Company or any
Subsidiary has (or could have) any obligation or liability individually, a
"Plan", and collectively, the "Plans"). Except as set forth on Schedule
4.23(a)(ii), neither the Company nor any Subsidiary has any
agreement, understanding, commitment or obligation to create, enter into or
contribute to any additional employee benefit plan (other than a Plan), or to
modify or amend any existing Plan. Except as set forth on Schedule
4.23(a)(iii), there has been no amendment, interpretation or other
announcement (written or oral) by the Company, any Subsidiary or any other
Person relating to, or change in participation or coverage under, any Plan
that, either alone or together with other such items or events, could
materially increase the expense of maintaining such Plan (or the Plans taken
as a whole) above the level of expense incurred with respect thereto for the
most recent fiscal year included in the Financial Statements.   (b) With
respect to each Plan, the Company has made available to the Purchaser true
and complete copies of (i) all plan documents, as in effect on the date
hereof, (ii) the latest Internal Revenue Service determination letter, if
applicable, (iii) the last filed Form 5500, if applicable, (iv) summary plan

prescribed by applicable laws, statutes, orders, rules and regulations,
including without limitation ERISA and the Code, and the Company and the
Subsidiaries (and, to the knowledge of the Company, all other Persons,
including without limitation, all fiduciaries) have properly performed all
material obligations required to be performed by them under (or with respect
to), and are not in any material respect in default under or in violation of,
any of the Plans or any of the legal requirements applicable thereto,
including without limitation any reporting, disclosure or notification
obligations.   (d) None of the Company, any Subsidiary, or to the knowledge
of the Company, any other Person has, with respect to any Plan, subject to
ERISA, engaged in or been a party to any "prohibited transaction", as such
term is defined in Section 4975 of the Code or Section 406 of ERISA, which
could result in the imposition of either a penalty assessed pursuant to
Section 502(i) of ERISA or a Tax imposed by Section 4975 of the Code.  
-33-    (e) There are no pending or, to the knowledge of the
Company, threatened claims, lawsuits or arbitrations (other than routine
claims for benefits), relating to any of the Plans, which have been asserted
or instituted against the Company, any Plan or the assets of any trust for
any Plan, nor, to the knowledge of the Company, is there a basis for any such
claim, lawsuit or arbitration. No Plan is currently under investigation,
audit or review, directly or indirectly, by any Governmental Authority, and,
to the knowledge of the Company, no such action is contemplated or under
consideration by any Governmental Authority. No Plan, which is subject to
ERISA, is a "multiemployer plan" (as defined in Section 3(37) of ERISA) or,
except as disclosed in Schedule 4.23(e), is subject to Section 412 of the
Code or Section 302 or Title IV of ERISA (each such Plan, a "Title IV
Plan").   (f) Neither the Company nor any Subsidiary has incurred
any liability (that will not be satisfied prior to the Closing Date) under
Title IV of ERISA. Solely with respect to the periods for which any
applicable statute of limitations has not barred claims associated with such
Plans, with respect to any Title IV Plan that the Company or any Subsidiary

maintain or contribute to): (i) the Company and each Subsidiary have made all
contributions that each of them has ever been required to make by operation
of law or by contract to such Title IV Plan; (ii) neither the Company nor any
Subsidiary has withdrawn from such Title IV Plan during a plan year in which

Title IV Plan, filed a notice of intent to terminate such Title IV Plan, or
adopted any amendment to treat such Title IV Plan as terminated; (iv) neither
the PBGC nor any other Person has instituted proceedings, or has notified the
Company or any Subsidiary or such Title IV Plan that it intends to institute
proceedings, to terminate (or to appoint a trustee to administer) such Title
IV Plan nor, to the knowledge of the Company, is there a reasonable basis for
the commencement of any such proceeding by the PBGC or any other Person; (v)

to the knowledge of the Company is threatened or about to occur (including
without limitation as a result of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement); (vi) all required premium payments to the PBGC have been paid
when due; (vii) no amendment with respect to which security is required under

reasonably expected by the Company or any Subsidiary to be made, to such
Title IV Plan; (viii) such Title IV Plan has been funded in accordance with
sound actuarial assumptions and practices, which have been consistently
applied; (ix) the most recent actuarial report prepared for such Title IV
Plan fairly presents the financial condition and the results of operations
for such Title IV Plan as of the date of such report; (x) the assets of such
Title IV Plan do not exceed the "benefit liabilities," as defined in Section
4001(a)(16) of ERISA, due under such Title IV Plan upon termination of such
Title IV Plan by a material amount; (xi) no accumulated funding deficiency,
whether or not waived, exists; (xii) no condition has occurred or exists that
with the passage of time could result in an accumulated funding deficiency
(as of the last day of the current plan year) (other than the payment of
future minimum required contributions and other than with respect to the
underfunded status of the Leach International Corporation Retirement
Plan); and (xiii) none of the Company, any Subsidiary or any other Person to
which any of them is a successor or parent corporation (within the meaning of
Section 4069(b) of ERISA) has engaged in a transaction that could reasonably
be expected to result in a liability to the Company or any Subsidiary under
Section 4069 of ERISA.   -34-    (g) The Company and each Subsidiary
have complied in all material respects with the provisions of Section 4980B
of the Code and Part 6 of Subtitle B of Title I of ERISA.   (h) Each Plan
that is intended to be qualified under Section 401(a) of the Code is (and at
all times for which any applicable statute of limitations has not barred
claims associated with such Plans) so qualified and its related trust is (and
at all times for which any applicable statute of limitations has not expired
has been) exempt from taxation under Section 501(a) of the Code. Each such
Plan (i) is the subject of an unrevoked favorable determination letter from
the IRS with respect to such Plan\'s qualified status under the Code, as
amended by the Tax Reform Act of 1986 and all subsequent legislation,
including, without limitation, that legislation commonly referred to as
"GUST" and "EGTRRA," or (ii) has remaining a period of time under the Code or
applicable Treasury regulations or IRS pronouncements in which to
request, and make any amendments necessary to obtain, such a letter from the
IRS. To the knowledge of the Company, nothing has occurred or, with respect
to actions taken or omitted by the Company or any Subsidiary, is reasonably
expected to occur, that could adversely affect the qualification or exemption
of any such Plan or its related trust.   (i) Except with respect to the
Subsidiaries, the Company is not, and during ten (10) years prior to the date
hereof has not been, a member of (i) a controlled group of corporations,
within the meaning of Section 414(b) of the Code, (ii) a group of trades or
businesses under common control, within the meaning of Section 414(c) of the
Code, (iii) an affiliated service group, within the meaning of Section 414(m)
of the Code, or (iv) any other group of Persons treated as a single employer
under Section 414(o) of the Code.   (j) Except as set forth on Schedule
4.23(j) (which disclosure includes the amount of unfunded liabilities as of
the dates indicated thereon), no Plan that covers or benefits any current or
former officer, employee, agent, director or independent contractor of the
Company or any Subsidiary (or any dependent or beneficiary of any such
individual) who performs (or performed) services for the Company or any
Subsidiary outside the United States has unfunded liabilities, determined in
accordance with GAAP, that have not been fully accrued on the Financial
Statements or will not be fully offset by insurance.   SECTION 4.24

policies of fire, liability, workmen\'s compensation and other similar forms
of insurance of the Company and the Subsidiaries, which policies are in full

received with respect to any such policy. Except as set forth on Schedule
4.24, the Company and the Subsidiaries maintain (a) insurance on all of their
property (including leased premises) that insures against loss or damage by
fire or other casualty and (b) insurance against liabilities, claims and
risks of a nature and in such amounts which the Company and the Subsidiaries
reasonably believe are prudent. Such policies or binders are sufficient for
compliance with all requirements of law currently applicable to the Company
or the respective Subsidiary and of all agreements to which the Company or
such Subsidiary is a party, will remain in full force and effect until the
respective expiration dates of such policies or binders, without the payment
of additional premiums, other than premiums scheduled to be paid
in accordance with the terms of such policies, and will not in any way be
affected by, or terminate or lapse by reason of, the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement. Since January 1, 1997, neither the Company
nor any Subsidiary has been refused any insurance with respect to its
respective assets or operations, nor has its coverage been limited by any
insurance carrier to which it has applied for any such insurance or with
which it has carried insurance. Except as set forth on Schedule 4.24, no
dispute with respect to coverage under any insurance policy exists with
respect to any insurance carrier.   -35-    Section 4.25 Compliance with
Laws. Other than (i) matters governed by Environmental Law, (ii) Tax matters,
(iii) Real Property matters, (iv) matters related to Unlawful Payments, and
(v) with respect to any Plans (which clauses (i) - (v) are addressed
elsewhere in this Agreement), the Company and the Subsidiaries have complied
and remain in compliance with all applicable laws, regulations and zoning
ordinances of any Governmental Authority, including export control laws and
regulations, except for those instances of non-compliance that could not
reasonably be expected, individually or in the aggregate, to result in
liability in excess of One Hundred Thousand Dollars ($100,000), and the
Company has no knowledge of and has not received any notice alleging any such
violation of any such laws, regulations or zoning ordinances.   SECTION 4.26
Real Estate.   (a) Owned Properties. Schedule 4.26(a) sets forth the address
and description of each parcel of Real Property owned by the Company or
the Subsidiaries (the "Owned Real Property"), and indicates which entity owns
such Owned Real Property. With respect to each parcel of Owned Real Property,
except as set forth on Schedule 4.26(a) or (b):   (A) the Company or the
Subsidiaries have good and marketable  title, free and clear of all
Liens;   (B) neither the Company nor any Subsidiary has leased or 
otherwise granted to any Person the right to use or occupy such  Owned Real
Property or any portion thereof; and   (C) there are no outstanding options,

Property  or any portion thereof or interest therein.   (b) Leased
Properties. Schedule 4.26(b) sets forth a list of all of the leases and
subleases for Real Property and all amendments, modifications and supplements

copies of each of the Leases described in Schedule 4.26(b). With respect to
each Lease listed in Schedule 4.26(b) and except as set forth in Schedule
4.26(b), (i) each Lease is legal, valid, binding, and enforceable, and in
full force and effect assuming due authorization, execution and delivery
by the counterparties to such Leases; (ii) neither the Company nor any
Subsidiary is in violation or in default of, in any material respect, or has
failed to perform any material obligation under, any Lease, and nothing has
occurred that with lapse of time or the giving of notice or both would
constitute such a breach or default of any Lease by the Company or the
Subsidiaries; (iii) to the knowledge of the Company no other party to such
Leases is in violation or in default of, in any material respect, or has
failed to perform any material obligation under, any Lease and nothing has
occurred that with the lapse of time or the giving of notice or both would
constitute such a breach or default of any Lease by such other party; and
(iv) neither the Company nor any Subsidiary has assigned, transferred,
conveyed, mortgaged, deeded in trust or encumbered any interest in any
Lease.   -36-    (c)General. The Real Property includes all real property
used in the Business. All such offices, manufacturing and production
facilities and other structures are adequate for the uses to which they are
being put and there are no applicable adverse zoning, building or land use
codes or rules, ordinances, regulations or other restrictions relating to
zoning or end use that currently, or to the knowledge of the Company, may
prospectively prevent, or cause the imposition of material fines or penalties
as the result of, the use of all or any portion of the Real Property for the
conduct of the Business as presently conducted. The Company or the relevant
Subsidiary has received all necessary approvals with regard to occupancy and
maintenance of the Real Property, except for such approvals which, if not
received, could not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse
Effect.   SECTION 4.27 Warranty and Product Liability Matters. Subject
only to the reserve for product warranty claims set forth on the March 31
Balance Sheet or on the books of the Company or the Subsidiaries, as the case
may be, in accordance with the past practices of the Company and the

manufactured, sold and delivered by the Company and the Subsidiaries have

Company.   SECTION 4.29 Government Contracts. Neither the Company nor
any Subsidiary has been suspended or debarred from bidding on contracts

modified by any supplemental disclosure delivered by the Company pursuant to
Section 6.01(o)), and the covenants, obligations and agreements in this
Agreement and in the other Transaction Documents, to the extent that they do
not earlier terminate in accordance with their terms, shall survive the

the Closing Date (the "Expiration Date"). Notwithstanding the preceding
sentence, (i) any representation, warranty, covenant, obligation or agreement
in respect of which indemnity is sought under this Agreement shall survive
the time at which it would otherwise terminate pursuant to the preceding
sentence to the extent a notice of a claim for indemnity has been given prior
to the Expiration Date in accordance with the provisions of, and satisfying
all of the requirements of, Section 9.05; provided, however, that such
representation, warranty, covenant, obligation, or agreement shall survive
solely with respect to, and only to the extent necessary to proceed with,
such claim for indemnity; and provided, further, that such limited survival
shall immediately and automatically terminate upon the resolution of such
claim for indemnity; and (ii) the Expiration Date shall not apply to any
breach of a representation, warranty, covenant, obligation or agreement based
on Fraud of the Parent, the Purchaser or the Company or with respect to
Dispute Losses. Claims for Purchaser Losses and Shareholder Losses based on

only until December 31, 2006.   SECTION 9.02 Shareholders\' Indemnity. From
and after the Closing Date, the Stockholders shall indemnify, defend and hold
harmless the Purchaser, the Surviving Corporation, the Parent, the
Intermediate Parent and their permitted and respective assigns and
Affiliates, and any director, officer, employee or agent of any of them (each
a "Purchaser Indemnified Party") from and against, and agree to pay or cause
to be paid to such Purchaser Indemnified Party, all Losses ("Purchaser
Losses") equal to the sum of:   (a) Representations and Warranties. Any
Purchaser Losses that a Purchaser Indemnified Party may incur or suffer,
which arise or result from any breach of any of the Company\'s
representations or warranties contained in this Agreement or in the other
Transaction Documents;   (b) Covenants and Agreements. Any Purchaser Losses
that a Purchaser Indemnified Party may incur or suffer, which arise or result

Indemnified Party may incur or suffer, which arise or result from (i) any
releases of Hazardous Substances by the Company prior to Closing and

and Forty Five Dollars ($24,145), including matters set forth in the
Corrective Action Consent Agreement dated May 14, 2004; and (ii) any claims
and costs that are incurred by the Company in addition to those associated
with the Final Remedy for the Baldwin Park Operable Unit of the San Gabriel
Valley Superfund site;   (d) Specific Tax Liabilities. Any Purchaser Losses
which a Purchaser Indemnified Party may incur or suffer related to (i) the

Schedule 4.21, and (iv) any Taxes incurred as a result of any payment or
payments to Robert Sires that constitute parachute payments pursuant to
Section 280G of the Code, irrespective of disclosure of such matters in the
Schedules, it being understood that any Taxes arising as a result of the loss
or lack of a deduction for a Purchaser Indemnified Party for such payment or
payments by reason of the application of Section 280G of the Code shall not
constitute Purchaser Losses for purposes of this Section 9.02(d)(iv);   (e)
Professional Fees. All reasonable professional fees (including those of
attorneys, accountants, consultants and engineers) and other
reasonable expenses incurred by any Purchaser Indemnified Party in connection

"Appraisal Premium"); provided, however, that the Stockholders shall only be
liable for the Appraisal Premium (i) if and to the extent the Dissenting
Shares constituted more than five percent (5%) of the Shares (such excess,
the "Excess Appraisal Shares"), and (ii) in an amount equal to the aggregate
Appraisal Premium multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is the
number of Excess Appraisal Shares and the denominator of which is the total
number of Dissenting Shares.   SECTION 9.03 Parent, Intermediate Parent,
Purchaser and Surviving Corporation Indemnity. The Parent, the Intermediate
Parent, the Purchaser, and after the Effective Time, the Surviving
Corporation, hereby agree to indemnify, defend and hold harmless the Company,
the Shareholder Representative and the Stockholders, and any heir,
representative, director, officer, stockholder, employee, Affiliate or agent
of any of them (each a "Shareholder Indemnified Party") from and against, and
agree to pay or cause to be paid to such Shareholder Indemnified Party all
Losses ("Shareholder Losses") equal to the sum of:   (a) Representations
and Warranties. Any Shareholder Losses that a Shareholder Indemnified Party

warranties contained in this Agreement or in the other Transaction
Documents;   -53-    (b) Covenants and Agreements. Any Shareholder Losses

result from any breach of any of the Parent\'s, the Intermediate Parent\'s or
the Purchaser\'s covenants, obligations or agreements contained in this
Agreement or in the other Transaction Documents;   (c) Specific
Liabilities. Any Shareholder Losses that a Shareholder Indemnified Party may
incur or suffer, which arise or result from the inclusion of the Intermediate
Parent as a party to this Agreement; and   (d) Professional Fees. All
reasonable professional fees (including those of attorneys, accountants,
consultants and engineers) and other reasonable expenses incurred by a
Shareholder Indemnified Party in connection with any of the aforesaid
matters.   SECTION 9.04 Joint and Several Obligation. All
indemnification obligations of the Parent, the Intermediate Parent, the
Purchaser and the Surviving Corporation pursuant to Section 9.03 shall be
joint and several. All indemnification obligations of the Stockholders for
claims arising out of Fraud subject to the limitations contained in Section
9.08 shall be several, but not joint.   SECTION 9.05 Procedure for
Indemnification. If any party entitled to indemnification pursuant to Section
9.02 or Section 9.03 (herein, the "Indemnitee") receives notice from a third
party of any matter that may give rise to a claim for indemnification by a
party or parties obligated to provide indemnification pursuant to Section
9.02 or Section 9.03 (herein, the "Indemnifying Party"), the procedure set
forth below shall be followed:   (a) Notice. The Indemnitee shall give to
the Indemnifying Party written notice of any claim, suit, judgment or matter
for which indemnity may be sought under Section 9.02 or Section 9.03,
promptly but in any event within twenty (20) business days after the
Indemnitee receives notice thereof; provided, however, that any delay in the
Indemnitee\'s delivery of notice to the Indemnifying Party shall not
prejudice the Indemnitee\'s right to receive indemnification unless, and then
only to the extent that, such delay prejudices the Indemnifying Party\'s
ability to mitigate or otherwise minimize the Losses or to contest such
claim. The Indemnifying Party shall have a period of twenty (20) business
days to respond thereto. If the Indemnifying Party does not respond within
such twenty (20) business day period, the Indemnifying Party shall be deemed
to have accepted responsibility for such indemnity. The
indemnification period provided for herein shall be tolled for a particular
claim for the period beginning on the date the Indemnifying Party receives
written notice of that claim until the final resolution of such claim.  
(b) Defense of a Claim. The Indemnifying Party shall have the right, at its
or their option, to be represented by counsel of its or their choice, which
counsel shall be reasonably acceptable to the Indemnitee, and to assume the
defense or otherwise control the handling of any claim, suit, judgment or
matter for which indemnity is sought, which is set forth in the notice sent
by the Indemnitee, by notifying the Indemnitee in writing to such effect
within twenty (20) business days of receipt of such notice;
provided, however, that the Indemnifying Party may not make such an election
to assume and control the defense of such claim without the Indemnitee\'s
consent unless (i) the Indemnifying Party acknowledges in writing its
obligations to indemnify the Indemnitee for such claim in accordance with the
terms of this Article 9 (provided that such acknowledgment may be subject to
obtaining further information with respect to such claim), and (ii) the suit,
action, claim, liability or obligation does not seek to impose any material
liability or   -54-   obligation upon the Indemnitee other than monetary
damages. If the Indemnifying Party elects to assume and control the defense,
the Indemnitee shall have the right to employ counsel separate from counsel
employed by the Indemnifying Party in any such action and to participate in
the defense thereof, but the reasonable fees and expenses of such counsel
employed by the Indemnitee shall be paid by the Indemnitee unless (x) the
Indemnifying Party agrees to bear such expense in writing, (y) the
Indemnifying Party has failed to assume the defense and employ counsel, or
(z) the named parties in any such action include both the Indemnitee and the
Indemnifying Party and representation of both parties by the same counsel
would be inappropriate due to actual differing interests between them. If the
Indemnifying Party does not give timely notice in accordance with
the preceding sentence, the Indemnifying Party shall be deemed to have given
notice that it does not wish to assume the defense or control the handling of
such claim, suit or judgment. In the event that the Indemnifying Party does
not assume the defense or otherwise control the handling of such matter,
the Indemnitee may retain counsel, as an indemnification expense, to defend
such claim, suit, judgment or matter.   (c) Final Authority. The parties
shall cooperate in the defense of any such claim or litigation and each shall
make available all books and records which are relevant in connection with
such claim or litigation. The Indemnifying Party will not consent to the
entry of any judgment or enter into any settlement with respect to any matter
which does not include a provision whereby the plaintiff or claimant in the
matter releases the Indemnitee from all liability with respect thereto
without the prior written consent of the Indemnitee, which consent shall not
be unreasonably withheld or delayed. If the Indemnitee has assumed the
handling of any claim, suit, judgment or matter for which indemnity is
sought, the Indemnitee will not consent to the entry of any judgment or enter
into any settlement with respect thereto without the prior written consent of
the Indemnifying Party, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or
delayed.   SECTION 9.06 Claims Between Parent or Surviving Corporation
and Stockholders. Any claim for indemnification under this Agreement which
does not result from the assertion of a claim by a third party (but excluding
any claim for indemnification that is brought under Section 9.12 hereof)
shall be asserted by written notice given by the Indemnitee to the
Indemnifying Party. The Indemnifying Party shall have a period of twenty (20)
business days within which to respond in writing thereto. If the Indemnifying
Party does not respond in writing within such twenty (20) business-day
period, the Indemnifying Party shall be deemed to have accepted
responsibility for such indemnity, and shall have no further right to contest
the validity of such claim. If the Indemnifying Party does respond in writing
within such twenty (20) business-day period and rejects such claim in whole
or in part, the Indemnitee shall be free to pursue such remedies as may be
available to it hereunder.   SECTION 9.07 Payment. In the case of the
Stockholders as Indemnifying Parties, the Shareholder Representative shall
cause any Purchaser Losses due to a Purchaser Indemnified Party pursuant to
Section 9.02 or Section 9.13 to be paid by the Escrow Agent from the Escrow
Amount to the extent of funds available thereunder and in accordance with the
procedures set forth in this Article 9 and the Escrow Agreement.  
-55-    SECTION 9.08 Certain Limitations as to Amounts of Recovery.   (a)
No Purchaser Indemnified Party or Shareholder Indemnified Party shall be
entitled to indemnification in respect of any claim or claims for Purchaser
Losses or Shareholder Losses unless and until the aggregate amount of all
Purchaser Losses for which the Stockholders are liable or Shareholder
Losses for which the Parent, the Intermediate Parent, the Purchaser and the
Surviving Corporation are liable, as the case may be, exceeds an aggregate
threshold of Six Hundred and Fifty Thousand Dollars ($650,000) (the "Minimum
Indemnity Threshold"), in which case the Purchaser Indemnified Parties or
Shareholder Indemnified Parties, as the case may be, shall be entitled to
recover the amount of such claims in excess of the Minimum Indemnity
Threshold. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the following categories of
Purchaser Losses and Shareholder Losses will not be subject to the Minimum
Indemnity Threshold: (i) Purchaser Losses resulting from a breach of the
representations and warranties contained in Section 4.34 with respect to
Discontinued Operations, (ii) Purchaser Losses resulting from the Fraud of
the Company or any Wholly-Owned Subsidiary and Shareholder Losses resulting
from the Fraud of the Parent, the Intermediate Parent or the Purchaser, (iii)
Shareholder Losses set forth in Section 9.03(c) and Section 11.06, and (iv)
Dispute Losses.   (b) Except as provided in Section 9.12 hereof and except
in the case of Purchaser Losses resulting from Fraud of the Company or
any Wholly-Owned Subsidiary, notwithstanding anything to the contrary in
this Agreement or the other Transaction Documents, the aggregate liability of
the Stockholders, the Company, and the Shareholder Representative (including
any indemnification with respect to Purchaser Losses) for any breach of
the obligations, covenants, agreements, representations, and warranties set
forth in this Agreement or in any of the other Transaction Documents, or for
any other claims or causes of actions arising out of, relating to or in
connection with the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby, whether
based upon breach of contract, tort or otherwise, shall in no event exceed
the Initial Escrow Deposit, and none of the Stockholders, the Company or the
Shareholder Representative shall have any liability hereunder at any time in
excess of the Escrow Amount at such time. In the event of Purchaser Losses
resulting from Fraud of the Company or any Wholly-Owned Subsidiary, the
Purchaser Indemnified Parties shall have the right to recover such Purchaser
Losses first against the Escrow Amount at such time (an "Escrow Fraud
Payment"), and if and only if the Escrow Amount has been exhausted and is
insufficient to pay such Purchaser Losses, thereafter against any other
Persons to which the Purchaser Indemnified Parties are legally entitled to
pursue, provided that in no event shall the Stockholders have any liability
to Purchaser Indemnified Parties for Purchaser Losses resulting from Fraud of
the Company or any Wholly-Owned Subsidiary in excess of, with respect to each
Stockholder on a pro rata basis, fifty percent (50%) of the Merger
Consideration actually received by each Stockholder, less such Stockholder\'s
pro rata share of the Escrow Fraud Payment made to such Purchaser Indemnified
Party.   SECTION 9.09 Exclusive Remedy. Except as expressly provided
in Section 15.02(a), the indemnification provisions of this Article 9 shall
be the sole and exclusive remedy of the parties for any breach of the
obligations, covenants, agreements, representations and warranties set forth
in this Agreement or in any of the other Transaction Documents, or for any
other claims or causes of actions arising out of, relating to or in
connection with the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby, whether
based upon breach of contract, tort or otherwise, and each party hereby
irrevocably waives all statutory, common law and other claims with respect
thereto, other than claims for indemnification pursuant to this Article
9.   -56-    SECTION 9.10 Exclusion of Certain Damages. Except as
provided in Section 15.02(a), no Indemnifying Party shall be responsible for
any indirect, special, punitive or consequential damages whatsoever,
including loss of profits or goodwill suffered or incurred by an Indemnitee,
in connection with any aspect of this Agreement or the other Transaction
Documents.   SECTION 9.11 Defense of Certain Disputes. The parties hereby
agree that the Shareholder Representative shall, in his sole discretion,
control all aspects of the Disputes on behalf of the Company and the
Subsidiaries, including, without limitation, their negotiation, settlement
and litigation or arbitration, and the choice of counsel to represent the
Surviving Corporation and the Subsidiaries; provided, that the Shareholder
Representative shall inform the Parent of the status of the Disputes at least
quarterly, and more often upon reasonable request by the Parent. The
Shareholder Representative on behalf of the Stockholders shall bear all fees
and expenses of such counsel. The Parent, the Intermediate Parent and the
Purchaser shall cause the Surviving Corporation and the Subsidiaries,
including their respective officers and employees, to cooperate in the
defense of the Disputes and shall make available to the Shareholder
Representative and its designees all books, records and other information and
documentation which are relevant in connection with the Disputes.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event the Parent reasonably believes
that the Shareholder Representative\'s actions, negotiation strategy, or its
litigation or arbitration activities are jeopardizing material
business relationships that the Parent wishes to preserve, the Parent may
assume control of the negotiation, settlement, litigation or arbitration, but
by doing so, Parent agrees to forego any indemnification against Dispute
Losses with respect to the Dispute so assumed.   SECTION 9.12 Dispute
Indemnity. From and after the Closing Date, the Stockholders shall indemnify,
defend and hold harmless the Purchaser, the Surviving Corporation, the
Parent, the Intermediate Parent and their permitted and respective assigns
and Affiliates, and any director, officer, employee or agent of any of them
(each a "Dispute Indemnified Party") from and against, and agree to pay or
cause to be paid to such Dispute Indemnified Party all Losses ("Dispute
Losses") equal to the sum of:   (a) Liability. Any Dispute Losses that a
Dispute Indemnified Party may incur or suffer, which arise, or result from or
are related to the Disputes or the facts and circumstances underlying the
Disputes; and   (b) Professional Fees. All reasonable professional fees
(including those of attorneys, accountants, consultants and engineers) and
other reasonable expenses incurred by a Dispute Indemnified Party in
connection with a breach of this Section 9.12.   SECTION 9.13 Payment of
Dispute Losses. The Shareholder Representative shall cause all Dispute Losses
due to a Dispute Indemnified Party to be paid on behalf of the Stockholders,
initially from the Estimated Future Expenses and then, upon exhaustion of the
same, from the Escrow Amount and finally from the Shareholder Representative
personally. In the event that any Dispute Losses are to be paid to a Dispute
Indemnified Party, the parties shall follow the procedure set forth
below:   -57-    (a) If a Dispute Indemnified Party makes a good faith
determination that it has incurred, suffered or has otherwise become subject
to Dispute Losses for which it is entitled to indemnification pursuant to
Section 9.12, such Dispute Indemnified Party shall notify the Shareholder
Representative of its claim (an "Indemnity Claim") by delivering written
notice of such claim (an "Indemnity Claim Notice") to the Shareholder
Representative, describing in detail in such Indemnity Claim Notice the
nature of the claim, the amount thereof, and all relevant facts and
information necessary to enable the Shareholder Representative to verify
whether such Dispute Indemnified Party is entitled to recover such Dispute
Losses.   (b) If the Shareholder Representative has a good faith objection

Period, the Dispute Indemnified Party and the Shareholder Representative
shall negotiate in good faith for a period of thirty (30) days to resolve

arbitration in accordance with Article 14 hereof.   (e) In the event that
any Disputes Losses are to be paid from the Escrow Amount, the Shareholder
Representative shall deliver a joint written instruction signed by such
Dispute Indemnified Party and the Shareholder Representative to the Escrow
Agent, which instruction shall authorize the Escrow Agent to pay the amount
specified therein to such Dispute Indemnified Party.   SECTION 9.14 Dispute

upon receipt thereof. All Dispute Proceeds shall be Post-Closing Merger
Consideration and allocated among the Stockholders by the Shareholder
Representative pro rata in accordance with Section 3.02(a) or paid to the

-62-    ARTICLE 14.  ARBITRATION AND GOVERNING LAW 
-----------------------------   SECTION 14.01 Arbitration and Governing Law.
Except for any disputes relating to the Closing Date Balance Sheet or the
calculation of the Final Net Working Capital which are to be resolved
pursuant to Section 3.06(b), any dispute which arises pursuant to the terms
of this Agreement shall be settled exclusively by arbitration conducted as
provided herein, and in accordance with the Commercial Arbitration Rules of
the American Arbitration Association. The arbitration shall be administered
by the American Arbitration Association.   (a) The arbitration shall be
conducted in New York, New York, by one (1) arbitrator, jointly selected by
the parties, except that if the parties are unable to agree on a single
arbitrator within fifteen (15) business days of the submission of a dispute
to arbitration, the arbitration shall be conducted by three (3) arbitrators,
who shall be selected as follows: one (1) arbitrator selected by the Parent
and one (1) arbitrator selected by the Company (or, after the Effective Time,
the Shareholder Representative), each within ten (10) business days of the
expiration of said fifteen (15) business days, and the third jointly selected
by the Parent and Company (or, after the Effective Time, the Shareholder
Representative), or if the parties are unable to agree within ten (10)
business days after the selection of the first two arbitrators, jointly by
the two (2) arbitrators selected by the parties.   (b) New York law shall
apply in determining the rights, obligations and liabilities of the parties;
provided, however, that the arbitrator(s) shall not have the power to grant
any indirect, special, punitive or consequential damages whatsoever,
including loss of profits or goodwill.   (c) The arbitrator(s) shall prepare
and deliver a written reasoned award. Judgment upon the award rendered by the
arbitrator(s) may be entered in any court having jurisdiction thereof and
shall be final and binding upon the parties.   (d) All costs and fees
relating to the arbitration shall be borne by the losing party, except that
if the arbitrator(s) determine that each party has prevailed in part and lost
in part, the costs and fees relating to the arbitration shall be allocated
between the parties as equitably determined by the arbitrator(s).   SECTION
14.02 Exclusive Means for Dispute Resolution.   (a) The failure or refusal
of any party to submit to arbitration or any of the other dispute resolution
mechanisms specified herein shall be deemed a breach of this Agreement. If
any party seeks and secures judicial intervention requiring enforcement of
this Article 14, such party shall be entitled to recover from the other party
in such judicial proceeding all costs and expenses, including reasonable
attorneys\' fees, that it was thereby required to incur.   -63-    (b)
Except for the dispute resolution procedure set forth in Section 3.06(b), the
procedures specified in this Article 14, shall be the sole and exclusive
procedures for the resolution of disputes between the parties arising out of
or relating to this Agreement; provided, however, that a party, without
prejudice to the above procedures, may seek a preliminary injunction or other
provisional judicial relief if in its sole judgment such action is necessary
to avoid irreparable damage or to preserve the status quo. Despite such
action, the parties will continue to participate in good faith in
the procedures specified in this Article 14.   ARTICLE 15.  TERMINATION 
-----------   SECTION 15.01 Termination. This Agreement may be terminated at
any time prior to Closing:   (a) by mutual written consent of the Parent
and the Company;   (b) by written notice delivered by any of the Parent,
the Intermediate Parent or the Purchaser on the one hand or the Company on
the other hand if (i) a representation or warranty was not true and correct
in all material respects when made by the non-terminating party, (ii)
the non-terminating party has failed to perform, satisfy, or comply with all
of its respective covenants and agreements in all material respects, or (iii)
the non-terminating party has failed to satisfy all of its respective
obligations and conditions in all material respects, provided that in the
case of (ii) and (iii), such non-terminating party has received thirty (30)
days notice of such failure and such failure has not been cured within such
thirty (30) day period, or if events have occurred which have made it
impossible to satisfy a condition precedent to the terminating party\'s
obligations to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby, unless such
terminating party\'s breach of this Agreement has prevented the condition
from being satisfied; or   (c) by written notice delivered by any of the
Parent, the Intermediate Parent and the Purchaser on the one hand or the
Company on the other hand if the Closing has not occurred on or prior to
August 30, 2004; provided that neither the Parent nor the Company shall be
entitled to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this Section 15.01(c), if
its willful breach of this Agreement has prevented the consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby at or prior to such time; and provided
further that, for the purposes of this Section 15.01(c), any willful breach
of this Agreement by the Intermediate Parent or the Purchaser shall be deemed
a willful breach by the Parent.   SECTION 15.02 Effect of Termination.  
(a) Notwithstanding anything contained herein to the contrary, if either (i)
as a result of a material breach of a covenant, obligation or agreement set
forth in this Agreement which occurs after the date hereof, which breach was
willful, intentional or committed in bad faith, the non-breaching party
exercises its termination rights pursuant to Section 15.01(b), or (ii)
a party willfully, intentionally or in bad faith does not proceed to close
the transactions contemplated hereby when and as required pursuant to the
terms hereof, then and in either such case, the breaching party (or in the
case where the breaching party is the Intermediate Parent or the Purchaser,
the Parent) shall pay to the non-breaching party the sum of Five Million
Dollars ($5,000,000)   -64-   (the "Termination Payment"). The parties
acknowledge and agree that, in the event of such a breach, it would be
difficult, costly or impossible to conclusively establish the actual damages
that the parties would have suffered, and that the Termination Payment shall
constitute liquidated damages and represent a reasonable pre-estimate of the
actual costs and damages which would be sustained by such party in the event
of such circumstances and further agree that such amounts are compensatory
only, and not punitive in nature or a penalty, and are, in any event, just,
fair and reasonable.   (b) In the event of termination of this Agreement by
the Parent, the Intermediate Parent, the Purchaser or the Company as provided
in Section 15.01(a) or Section 15.01(c), this Agreement will forthwith become
void and shall automatically terminate with no further force or effect, and,
except as provided in Section 15.02(a) in the event of a termination pursuant
to Section 15.01(b), there will be no liability or obligation on the part of
any party hereto to any other party hereto or its stockholders, members,
directors, managers or officers in respect thereof, except that nothing
herein will relieve any party hereto from liability for any breach of this
Agreement prior to such termination.     [REMAINDER OF PAGE INTENTIONALLY
