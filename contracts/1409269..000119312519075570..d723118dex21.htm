Company or Merger Sub, as applicable, to its creditors, and (iv) has
determined to recommend that the sole shareholder of Merger Sub vote to
approve the Merger and such other actions as contemplated by this Agreement.

Company and Merger Sub shall (and Radiant shall cause Merger Sub to), in
coordination with each other, deliver to the Registrar of Companies of the
State of Israel (the "Companies Registrar") a notice of the contemplated

proposed date of the Closing on which the Companies Registrar is requested to

the ICL (the "Certificate of Merger"). The Merger shall become effective upon
the issuance by the Companies Registrar of the Certificate of Merger in
accordance with Section 323(5) of the ICL (such date and time being
hereinafter referred to as the "Effective Time"). 

1.3 Effects of the Merger. The Merger shall have the effects set forth in this
Agreement and in the applicable provisions of the ICL. Without limiting the
generality of the foregoing, and subject thereto, at the Effective Time, by
virtue of, and simultaneously with, the Merger and without any further action
on the part of Radiant, Merger Sub, the Company or any shareholder of the
Company, (a) the Company will become a direct wholly-owned subsidiary of
Radiant, (b) the Company will continue to be governed by the laws of the State

immunities, powers and franchises of the Company and Merger Sub shall vest in
the Surviving Company, and (f) all debts, liabilities and duties of the
Company and Merger Sub shall become the debts, liabilities and duties of the

1.4 Articles of Association; Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws;
Directors and Officers. At the Effective Time:

(a) the articles of association of the Surviving Company, shall be, subject to
and conditioned upon the consummation of the Merger, amended and restated, by
means of Company shareholder action, to be in the form attached hereto as
_Exhibit G_ , until thereafter amended as provided by the ICL and such
articles of association; 

(b) the Radiant Charter shall be the certificate of incorporation of Radiant
immediately prior to the Effective Time, until thereafter amended as provided
by the DGCL and such certificate of incorporation; provided, however, that at
the Effective Time, Radiant shall file one or more amendments to its
certificate of incorporation, to the extent approved by the holders
of Radiant Common Stock as contemplated by _Section_ __ _ 5.2_, to (i)
change the name of Radiant to a name mutually agreed upon by Radiant and the
Company in good faith (ii) effect the Reverse Stock Split, and (iii) make
such other changes as are mutually agreeable to Radiant and the Company.

1.5 Effect of the Merger on Share Capital; Exchange of Certificates.

(a) _Effect on Securities_. At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger
and without any action on the part of Radiant, Merger Sub, the Company or the
holders of any securities of the Company or Merger Sub:

 

(i) _Conversion of Company Ordinary Shares and Company Preferred Shares_.
Subject to the remaining provisions of this  _Section_ __ _ 1.5_, each
Company Ordinary Share and each Company Preferred Share issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than shares described in 
_Section_ __ _ 1.5(a)(ii)_) shall be deemed to have been transferred to
Radiant solely in consideration for the right to receive from Radiant, in
accordance with the terms of this Agreement, 8.6506 validly issued, fully
paid and nonassessable shares of Radiant Common Stock (such ratio, as such
number may be adjusted in accordance with the provisions of this _Section_ __
_ 1.5,_ the "Exchange Ratio" and such shares of Radiant Common Stock, the
"Merger Consideration"), in each case without interest. Each Company Ordinary
Share and each Company Preferred Share shall be deemed to have been
transferred to Radiant solely in consideration for the right to receive
the Merger Consideration as provided in this _ Section_ __ _ 1.5(a)(i),_
shall no longer be held by the applicable former Company shareholder and shall
be deemed to have been transferred to Radiant, and the holders of 

 



3

   ##### Table of Contents

   

 

 certificates (the "Certificates") or book-entry shares ("Book-Entry
Shares"), which immediately prior to the Effective Time represented such
Company Ordinary Shares or Company Preferred Shares, shall cease to have any
rights with respect to such Company Ordinary Shares and Company Preferred
Shares other than the right to receive, upon surrender of such Certificates or
Book-Entry Shares in accordance with _ Section_ __ _ 1.6_, the Merger
Consideration as set forth above.

(ii) _Treasury Stock (Dormant Shares) and Radiant-Owned Company Share
Capital_. No consideration or payment shall be due or delivered with respect
to any and all Company Share Capital held by the Company as treasury stock
(dormant shares) or held directly by Radiant or Merger Sub immediately prior
to the Effective Time.

(iii) _Share Capital_. Each ordinary share of Merger Sub issued and
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall cease to exist at
the Effective Time and no consideration or payment shall be due or delivered
thereof or in respect thereof. Each share of the Company issued and
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall by virtue of the
shareholder action set forth in _Section_ __ _ 1.4(a),_ subject to and
conditioned upon the consummation of the Merger, be reclassified at the
Effective Time into an ordinary share of the Surviving Company par value NIS
0.001 each.

(iv) _Fractional Shares_. No fraction of a share of Radiant Common Stock will
be issued in connection with the Merger, and any fractional shares will be
rounded down to the nearest whole share. Company Shareholders will not be
entitled to any voting rights, rights to receive any dividends or
distributions or other rights as a shareholder of Radiant with respect to any
such fraction of a share that would have otherwise been issued to such Company
Shareholder.

 

(b) _Adjustments_. Without limiting the other provisions of this Agreement, if
at any time during the period between the date of this Agreement and up to
and including the Effective Time, any change in the number or type of
outstanding shares of Radiant Common Stock or Company Share Capital shall
occur as a result of a reclassification, recapitalization, exchange, stock
split (including a reverse stock split), combination or readjustment of
shares or any stock dividend or stock distribution with a record date during
such period, the Merger Consideration and any other similarly dependent items,
as the case may be, shall be appropriately adjusted to provide the holders of
Company Share Capital the same economic effect as contemplated by this
Agreement prior to such event. Nothing in this _ Section_ __ _ 1.5(b)_ shall
be construed to permit any party to take any action that is otherwise
prohibited or restricted by any other provision of this Agreement.

(c) _Treatment of Company Options and Company Warrants_. Each Company Option
and each Company Warrant that is outstanding and unexercised immediately prior
to the Effective Time will be treated in accordance with _Section_ __ _ 5.4._

 

1.6 Payment Procedures.

 

(a) _Designation of Exchange Agent; Deposit of Exchange Fund_. Prior to the
Closing, Radiant shall enter into one or more exchange agreements in
customary form and reasonably satisfactory to the Company with one or more of
the transfer agent of Radiant, the transfer agent of the Company or another
financial institution or trust company designated by Radiant that

Certificates (or affidavits of loss in lieu thereof) and make such payments
and deliveries with respect to Book-Entry Shares upon compliance with such
reasonable terms and conditions as the Exchange Agent may impose to effect an
orderly exchange thereof in accordance with normal exchange practices. No

or shall be otherwise in proper form for transfer (or the Book-Entry Share so
surrendered shall be in proper form for transfer) and (ii) the Person
requesting such payment shall have paid any transfer and other similar Taxes
required by reason of the payment of the Merger Consideration to a Person
other than the registered holder of such Certificate or Book-Entry Share (as
applicable) surrendered or shall have established to the reasonable
satisfaction of Radiant that such Tax either has been paid or is not required

(d) _Termination of Exchange Fund_. Any portion of the Exchange Fund which
remains undistributed to the holders of the Certificates or Book-Entry Shares

designee upon demand, and any such holders prior to the Merger who have not
theretofore complied with this _Section_ __ _ 1_ shall thereafter look only
to Radiant as general creditors thereof for payment, without interest, of
their claims for Merger Consideration.

 

(e) _No Liability_. None of Radiant, Merger Sub, the Company or the Exchange
Agent shall be liable to any Person in respect of any shares of Radiant
Common Stock, or dividends or distributions with respect thereto, delivered to
a Governmental Authority pursuant to and as required by any applicable
abandoned property, escheat or similar Law. If any Certificate shall not
have been surrendered or Book-Entry Share not paid, in each case, in
accordance with _ Section_ __ _ 1.6(b)(i)_, immediately prior to the date on
which any Merger Consideration, or dividends or distributions with respect
thereto, in respect of such Certificate or Book-Entry Share would otherwise
escheat to or become the property of any Governmental Authority, any such
Merger Consideration, or dividends or distributions with respect thereto, in
respect of such Certificate or Book-Entry Share shall, to the extent
permitted by applicable Law, become the property of Radiant free and clear of
all claims or interest of any Person previously entitled thereto.

Amount"). The 102 Amount shall be held in trust by the 102 Trustee pursuant to
the applicable provisions of Section 102 of the Ordinance and the Options Tax
Ruling and shall be released by the 102 Trustee to the beneficial holders of

Agent, the posting by such Person of a bond, in such reasonable amount as the
Exchange Agent may require, as indemnity against any claim that may be made

1.8 Transfers; No Further Ownership Rights. From and after the Effective
Time, all issued and outstanding Company Share Capital shall automatically be
deemed to have been transferred to Radiant, and each holder of a Certificate
or Book-Entry Share theretofore representing any Company Share Capital shall
cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except the right to receive the
Merger Consideration payable therefor upon the surrender or acknowledgment of
the conversion or deemed transfer thereof in accordance with the
provisions of _ Section_ __ _ 1.5(a)(i)_. The Merger Consideration paid in
accordance with the terms of this _Section_ __ _ 1_ shall be deemed to have
been paid in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to such Company Share
Capital. From and after the Effective Time, there shall be no registration of
transfers on the shareholders register of the Company of Company Share Capital
immediately prior to the Effective Time of Company Share Capital that
was outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time. If Certificates or
Book-Entry Shares are presented to the Surviving Company, Radiant or the
Exchange Agent following the Effective Time, they shall be deemed to have been
transferred to Radiant as of the Effective Time against delivery of the
Merger Consideration and other required amounts, as provided for in _
Section_ __ _ 1.5(a)(i)_, for the Company Share Capital formerly represented
by such Certificates or Book-Entry Shares.

1.9 Further Action. If, at any time after the Effective Time, any further
action is determined by Radiant or the Surviving Company to be necessary or
desirable to carry out the purposes of this Agreement or to vest the Surviving
Company or Radiant with full right, title and possession of and to all rights
and property of Merger Sub and the Company with respect to the Merger, the
officers and managers of Radiant shall be fully authorized (in the name of
Merger Sub, the Company, the Surviving Company and otherwise) to take such
action.

 

1.10 Withholding Tax.

 

(a) Each of Radiant, Merger Sub, the Surviving Company, the 102 Trustee and
the Exchange Agent (each, a "Withholding Payor") shall deduct and withhold
from the Merger Consideration otherwise payable in connection with the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement such amounts as shall be
reasonably determined by Radiant according to any applicable law that
each Withholding Payor is required to deduct and withhold under the
Withholding Tax Ruling and the Options Tax Ruling or under any applicable Tax
Law with respect to (i) the payment or delivery of the Merger Consideration in
accordance with  _Section_ __ _ 1_ to each holder of Company Share Capital
and (ii) the securities that each holder of Company Options or Company
Warrants receives in accordance with _Section_ __ _ 5.4_ _._ With respect to
the withholding of Israeli Tax, in the event any holder of record of Company
Share Capital or Company Options or Company Warrants provides the Withholding
Payor with a Valid Tax Certificate issued by the ITA regarding the withholding
(or exemption from withholding) of Israeli Tax from the consideration payable
then the deduction and withholding of any amounts under the Ordinance or any
other provision of Israeli Law or requirement, if any, from the Merger
Consideration payable to such holder of record of Company Share Capital,
Company Options or Company Warrants, as applicable, shall be made only in
accordance with the provisions of such Valid Tax Certificate. To the extent
amounts are so withheld, they shall be subsequently paid over to the
appropriate Governmental Authority on or prior to the last day on which such
payment is required under any applicable Law. To the extent any Withholding
Payor withholds any amounts, such Withholding Payor shall provide the
affected Person, as soon as practicable, with (i) confirmation of such
withholding, and (ii) evidence regarding payment to of such withheld amounts
to the appropriate Governmental Authority. To the extent that amounts are so
withheld by a Withholding Payor and paid over to the appropriate Governmental
Authority, such withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this
Agreement as having been paid to such affected Person in respect of which such
deduction and withholding was made.

(b) Notwithstanding the provisions of _Section_ __ _ 1.10(_ _a)_ with respect
to Israeli Taxes and subject to the provisions of Withholding Tax Ruling or
the Options Tax Ruling, as applicable, the consideration payable to each
holder of Company Share Capital, Company Options or Company Warrants (other
than the 102 Trustee with respect to Company 102 Options and Company 102
Shares) shall be retained by the Exchange Agent for a period of up to the
later of: (i) one hundred eighty (180) days from Closing and (ii) the date
upon which shares

   ##### Table of Contents

   

 

 comprising the Merger Consideration shall be registered pursuant to the
Registration Statement (the "Withholding Drop Date") (during which time no
Withholding Payor shall make any payments to any holder of Company Share
Capital, Company Options or Company Warrants (other than to the 102 Trustee)
or withhold any Israeli Taxes in respect of said consideration, except as
instructed by the ITA, including via the Withholding Tax Ruling or the
Options Tax Ruling, as applicable). If no later than five (5) Business Days
prior to the Withholding Drop Date a Valid Tax Certificate is delivered to the
Withholding Payor, then, subject to as may be otherwise instructed by the
ITA, including by way of the Withholding Tax Ruling or the Options Tax Ruling,
as applicable, with respect to the affected holders, the deduction and
withholding of any Israeli Taxes shall be made only in accordance with the
provisions of such Valid Tax Certificate (and, unless otherwise provided in
the Withholding Tax Ruling or the Options Tax Ruling, as applicable, together
with such Valid Tax Certificate the holder of Company Share Capital, Company
Options or Company Warrants shall deliver an amount in cash equal to the
amount of the applicable withholding Tax) and the balance of the payment that
is not withheld shall be paid to such holders subject to any non-Israeli
withholding which is applicable to the payment (if any). If any such holder
(i) does not provide the Withholding Payor with or is not the subject of a
Valid Tax Certificate, by no later than five (5) Business Days before the
Withholding Drop Date, or (ii) submits a written request to the Withholding
Payor to release its portion of the consideration prior to the Withholding
Drop Date (together with an amount in cash equal to the amount of the
applicable withholding Tax) and fails to submit a Valid Tax Certificate at or
before such time, then the amount to be withheld from such holders portion of
the consideration shall be calculated according to the applicable withholding
rate as reasonably determined by Radiant in accordance with applicable Law
increased by interest plus linkage differences, as defined in Section 159A of
the Ordinance, for the period between the fifteenth (15th) day of the calendar
month following the month during which the Closing occurs and the time the
relevant payment is made, and calculated in NIS based on a $ to NIS exchange
rate not lower than the effective exchange rate at the Closing Date as
reasonably determined by the Withholding Payor in consultation with the
Exchange Agent and otherwise deducted, withheld and paid in accordance with
_Section_ __ _ 1.10(a)_. If the amount in cash as aforesaid was not provided
by such holder, in the event such shares so withheld have been registered
pursuant a Registration Statement under the United States securities laws,
then the Exchange Agent shall be entitled to sell such shares and remit the
proceeds therefrom to the ITA, all in accordance with the Withholding Tax
Ruling and the Ordinance. __ To the extent that amounts are so withheld by a
Withholding Payor and in due course paid over to the appropriate Governmental
Authority, such withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this
Agreement as having been paid to such affected Person in respect of which
such deduction and withholding was made.

1.11 Appraisal Rights. In accordance with Israeli law, no statutory
dissenters or statutory appraisal rights shall be available with respect to
the Merger or the Contemplated Transactions.

or occurrence, obligate Company or any other entity to make any parachute
payment that would be subject to Section 280G of the Code.

financial position of Radiant and its consolidated Subsidiaries as of its

Agreement, will fairly present, in all material respects, the consolidated
financial position of Radiant and its consolidated Subsidiaries as of its date
and each of the consolidated statements of income, changes in shareholders
equity (deficit) and cash flows included in or incorporated by reference into
the Radiant SEC Reports (including any related notes and schedules) fairly
presents in all material respects, the results of operations, retained
earnings (loss) and changes in financial position, as the case may be, of such
companies for the periods set forth therein (except as indicated in the notes
thereto, and in the case of unaudited statements, as may be permitted by the
rules of the SEC, and subject to normal year-end audit adjustments that will
not be material in amount or effect), in each case in accordance with GAAP

except as may be noted therein.

 

(d) Radiant has designed and maintains a system of internal control over
financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) of the
Exchange Act) sufficient to provide reasonable assurance regarding the
reliability of financial reporting, and, to the Knowledge of Radiant, such
system is effective in providing such assurance. Radiant (i) maintains
disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and
15d-15(e) of the Exchange Act) designed to ensure that information required
to be disclosed by Radiant in the reports that it files or submits under the
Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time
periods specified by the SECs rules and forms, and such disclosure controls
and procedures are effective (ii) has, to the extent required by Law,
disclosed, based on the most recent evaluation of its chief executive officer
and its principal financial officer prior to the date of this Agreement, to
Radiants auditors and the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors of

(y) any significant deficiencies in the design or operation of internal
control over financial reporting that would adversely affect in any material
respect Radiants ability to record, process, summarize and report financial
information and (z) any material weakness in internal control over
financial reporting, and (B) any fraud, whether or not material, that
involves management or other employees who have a significant role in
Radiants internal controls over financial reporting. Each of Radiant and its
Subsidiaries have materially complied with or substantially addressed such
deficiencies, material weaknesses or fraud. Radiant has delivered or made

Exchange Act or Sections 302 and 906 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and the rules
and regulations of the SEC promulgated thereunder with respect to the Radiant
SEC Reports, and the statements contained in such certifications were true and
correct on the date such certifications were made. For purposes of this
_Section_ __ _ 3.5(e)_, "principal executive officer" and "principal
financial officer" has the meanings given to such terms in the Sarbanes-Oxley
Act. None of Radiant or any of its Subsidiaries has outstanding, or has
arranged any outstanding, "extensions of credit" to directors or executive
officers in violation of Section 402 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act.

Subsidiaries has engaged in questionable accounting or auditing practices.

and the Person that made it and (y) prior to the approval of the Radiant
Shareholder Proposals at the Radiant Shareholder Meeting, Radiant may take the
following actions in response to an unsolicited bona fide written Radiant

Radiant Superior Offer: (A) furnish nonpublic information regarding Radiant
to the third party making the Radiant Acquisition Proposal (a "Radiant

acknowledges and agrees that any violation of any of the restrictions set
forth in the preceding sentence by any Representative of Radiant or any of its
Subsidiaries, whether or not such Representative is purporting to act on
behalf of Radiant or any of its Subsidiaries, shall be deemed to constitute
a breach of this _Section_ __ _ 4.5(a)_ by Radiant.

(i) "Radiant Acquisition Proposal" means any proposal, indication of interest

regulations thereunder) of securities representing twenty five percent (25%)
or more of the voting power of Radiant (including securities of Radiant

to "seventy-five percent (75%)" for these purposes) made by a third party
that the Board of Directors of Radiant determines in good faith, after
consultation with its outside legal counsel and financial advisor, and after
taking into account all financial, legal, regulatory, and other aspects of
such Radiant Acquisition Proposal (including the financing terms and the
ability of such third party to finance such Radiant Acquisition Proposal),

Shareholders than as

 provided hereunder (including any changes to the terms of this Agreement
proposed by the Company in response to such Radiant Superior Offer pursuant to
and in accordance with  _Section_ __ _ 4.5(d)_ or otherwise) and (B) is
reasonably capable of being completed on the terms proposed without
unreasonable delay.

 

(c) Except as otherwise provided in _Section_ __ _ 4.5(d)_, neither the Board
of Directors of Radiant nor any committee of the Board of Directors of

(d) Notwithstanding anything in this _Section_ __ _ 4.5 _to the contrary, if
at any time prior to the approval of the Radiant Shareholder Proposals at the
Radiant Shareholder Meeting, Radiant receives a Radiant Acquisition Proposal
from a third party (which did not result from or arise out of or
in connection with a breach of this Agreement) that the Board of Directors of
Radiant determines in good faith, after consultation with its outside legal
counsel and financial advisors, constitutes a Radiant Superior Offer and the
Board of Directors of Radiant determines in good faith (after consultation
with outside legal counsel and financial advisor) that failure to effect a
Radiant Change of Recommendation would reasonably be expected to be
inconsistent with the fiduciary duties of the Board of Directors of Radiant
under applicable Laws, the Board of Directors of Radiant may (i) effect a
Radiant Change of Recommendation, and/or (ii) terminate this Agreement in
accordance with _Section_ __ _ 9.1(i)_ in order to enter into a definitive
agreement for a Radiant Superior Offer; _provided_ , _however_ , that such
actions may only be taken (A) at a time that is after the fourth (4th)
Business Day following Companys receipt of written notice from Radiant that
the Board of Directors of Radiant and/or a committee thereof is prepared to
take such action (which notice will specify the identity of the Person making
such Radiant Superior Offer and a summary of the material terms of
the applicable Radiant Superior Offer, including a copy of the proposed
definitive agreement), and (B) at the end of such period, the Board of
Directors of Radiant and/or a committee thereof determines in good faith,
after taking into account all amendments or revisions to this Agreement
proposed by Company and after consultation with Radiants outside legal
counsel and financial advisors, that such Radiant Superior Offer remains a
Radiant Superior Offer and (C) if requested by the Company during such four
(4) Business Day period, Radiant engages in good faith negotiations with the
Company to consider amendments to this Agreement proposed by the Company that
would result in the offer that was determined to constitute a Radiant
Superior Offer no longer constituting a Radiant Superior Offer. During any
such four (4) Business Day period, the Company shall be entitled to deliver to
Radiant one or more counterproposals to amend this Agreement so as to cause
such Radiant Superior Offer to no longer be a Radiant Superior Offer (it
being understood that any change in the purchase price or form of
consideration in such Radiant Superior Offer shall be deemed a material
modification and shall trigger a new notice and negotiation period as
provided above, except that the four (4) Business Day notice period shall
instead be equal to two (2) Business Days).

 

(e) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this _Section_ __ _ 4.5_, if,
at any time prior to the approval of the Radiant Shareholder Proposals at the
Radiant Shareholder Meeting, the Board of Directors of Radiant determines in
good faith, after consultation with its outside legal counsel and financial
advisors, that there has been a Radiant Intervening Event, the Board of
Directors of Radiant may effect a Radiant Change of Recommendation if (i)
Radiant notifies the Company, in writing, four (4) Business Days before making
a Radiant Change of Recommendation that the Board of Directors of Radiant
and/or a committee thereof intends to consider such action, which notice shall
include a reasonably detailed description of the material facts and
circumstances giving rise to the applicable Radiant Intervening Event, which
notice shall not, by itself, constitute a Radiant Change of Recommendation,
(ii) if requested by the Company during such four (4) Business Day

 period, Radiant engages in good faith negotiations with the Company to amend
this Agreement in such a manner that the underlying facts giving rise to, and
the reasons for taking such action, ceases to constitute a Radiant
Intervening Event, and (iii) the Board of Directors of Radiant determines in
good faith after taking into account all amendments or revisions to this
Agreement proposed by the Company and, after consultation with its outside
legal counsel and financial advisors, that the failure to make a Radiant
Change of Recommendation would reasonably be expected to be inconsistent with
the fiduciary duties of the Board of Directors of Radiant under applicable
Law. Radiant acknowledges and hereby agrees that any Radiant Change of
Recommendation effected (or proposed to be effected) in response to or in
connection with any Radiant Acquisition Proposal may be made pursuant to 
_Section_ __ _ 4.5(d)_ only, and may not be made pursuant to this _Section_
__ _ 4.5(e)_.

(f) Nothing contained in this Agreement shall prohibit Radiant or the Radiant
Board of Directors from complying with Rules 14d-9 and 14e-2(a) promulgated
under the Exchange Act; _provided_ , _however_ , that any disclosure made by
Radiant or the Radiant Board of Directors pursuant to Rules 14d-9 and 14e-2(a)
shall be limited to a statement that Radiant is unable to take a position
with respect to the bidders tender offer unless the Radiant Board of
Directors determines in good faith, after consultation with its outside legal
counsel, that such statement would result in a breach of its fiduciary duties
under applicable Law; _provided_ further, that any such disclosures (other
than a "stop, look and listen" communication or similar communication of the
type contemplated by Section 14d-9(f) under the Exchange Act) shall be deemed
to be a Radiant Change of Recommendation unless the Radiant Board of Directors
expressly publicly reaffirms the Radiant Recommendation (i) in
such communication or (ii) within five (5)  Business Days after being
requested in writing to do so by the Company.

4.6 Notification of Solicitation. Radiant shall notify the Company no later
than twenty-four (24) hours after receipt of any Radiant Acquisition Proposal
and any such notice shall be made orally and in writing and shall indicate in
reasonable detail the material terms and conditions of such Radiant
Acquisition Proposal, and the identity of the offeror. Radiant shall keep the
Company informed, on a current basis, of the status and material developments
(including any changes to the terms) of such Radiant Acquisition Proposal.

4.7 Standstill. Radiant shall, and shall cause each of its Subsidiaries and
their Representatives to, immediately cease and cause to be terminated any and
all existing activities, discussions or negotiations with any Person conducted
heretofore with respect to, or that may reasonably be expected to lead to, a
Radiant Acquisition Proposal.

4.8 Cooperation with Financing. Prior to the Closing, Radiant shall use its
commercially reasonable efforts to provide, and shall cause its Subsidiaries
to provide, and shall cause its representatives, directors, officers,
employees, consultants and advisors, including its legal and accounting
advisors (in each case at the Companys sole expense with respect to any
reasonable, out-of-pocket and documented costs and expenses incurred by
Radiant or its Subsidiaries in connection therewith) to provide, such
cooperation as is reasonably requested by the Company in connection with
causing the conditions in the Financing Consent Letters to be satisfied,
including:

 

(a) furnishing to the Company and the other parties to the Financing Consent
Letters, all reasonable financial and other pertinent information regarding
Radiant and its Subsidiaries (including their businesses, operations and
existing financial projections) as may be reasonably requested as promptly as
reasonably practicable;

 

(b) executing and delivering definitive financing documents, including
guarantee and collateral documents, currency or interest hedging arrangements
and other certificates and documents as may be reasonably requested by the
Company; provided that such documents shall only be effective at or after
Closing;

 

(c) facilitating the pledging of collateral and reasonable cooperation in
connection with the payoff of existing indebtedness for borrowed money of
Radiant and its Subsidiaries and the release of related liens, provided
further that such pledges, payoffs and releases shall only be effective at

(d) executing and delivering a certificate of the chief financial officer of
such Party (solely on behalf of such Party and not in such persons
individual capacity) with respect to the solvency of Radiant and its
Subsidiaries; provided that such documents shall only be effective at Closing;

 

(e) cooperating with requests for due diligence to the extent customary and
reasonable and to the extent available to such Party and its Subsidiaries;

(f) providing reasonable access to Radiants and its Subsidiaries current
assets, cash management and accounting systems, and policies and procedures
relating thereto, for the purpose of establishing collateral arrangements
(including allowing access for field exams, collateral audits, asset

and property condition reports); and

(g) at least three (3) Business Days prior to the Closing Date, providing all
documentation and other information about Radiant and each of its Subsidiaries
as is reasonably requested in writing by the Party at least ten (10) Business
Days prior to the Closing Date that is required to be delivered pursuant to
paragraph 8 of Exhibit B to the Financing Consent Letter relating to "know
your customer" and anti-money laundering rules and regulations including the
USA PATRIOT Act.

 

(h) Notwithstanding the foregoing, (x) nothing in this _Section_ __ _ 4.8_
shall require any such cooperation to the extent it would unreasonably
interfere with the business or operations of Radiant and its Subsidiaries and
(y) none of Radiant or any of its Subsidiaries shall be required to pay any
commitment or other fee or incur any other liability or obligation in
connection with the Financing Consent Letters or be required to take any
action that would subject it to actual or potential liability, to bear any
cost or expense or to pay any commitment or other similar fee or make any
other payment or agree to provide any indemnity in connection with the
Financing Consent Letters or any of the foregoing, in each case, that is
effective prior to the Closing. For the avoidance of doubt, none of Radiant or
its Subsidiaries or their respective officers, directors or employees shall
be required to execute or enter into or perform any agreement with respect to
the Financing Consent Letters that is not contingent upon the Closing or that
would be effective prior to the Closing. The Company shall indemnify and hold
harmless Radiant and its Subsidiaries and their respective directors,
officers, employees, accountants, consultants, legal counsel and other agents
(each, an "Indemnified Party") from and against any and all losses and
reasonable out-of-pocket expenses suffered or incurred by them in connection
with the Financing Consent Letters and the performance of their respective
obligations under this _Section_ __ _ 4.8_ and any information utilized in
connection therewith (except to the extent directly resulting from the gross
negligence, willful misconduct and/or fraud of such Indemnified Party;
provided, that Radiant and its respective Affiliates, and not the Company,
shall be responsible for any general expenses incurred in connection with the
transactions contemplated hereby to the extent such expenses are not
exclusively related to the performance of such Indemnified Partys
obligations under this _Section_ __ _  4.8_.

4.9 Non-Solicitation by the Company. Without the prior written consent of
Radiant, none of the Company, its Subsidiaries or any Representative of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries shall directly or indirectly (a) initiate,
solicit, propose, seek or knowingly encourage, facilitate or support any
inquiries, indications of interest, proposals or offers that constitute or may
reasonably be expected to lead to, a Company Alternative Transaction (as
defined below), (b) engage in, continue, facilitate or otherwise participate
in any discussions or negotiations regarding, or furnish any nonpublic
information or data to any Person in connection with, any inquiries,
indications of interest, proposals or offers that constitute, or may
reasonably be expected to lead to, a Company Alternative Transaction, (c)
enter into any letter of intent, indication of interest, agreement in
principle or other similar type of agreement relating to a Company Alternative
Transaction, or enter into any agreement or agreement in principle requiring
the Company to abandon, terminate or fail to consummate the transactions
contemplated hereby or resolve, propose or agree to do any of the foregoing.
For purposes of this _Section_ __ _ 4.9_, "Company Alternative Transaction"
means any transaction involving (a) the direct or indirect sale, license,
disposition or acquisition of any material portion of the business or assets
of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, (b) the direct or indirect

that is or may become convertible into or exchangeable for any shares of
capital stock or other equity security of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries, or (c) any merger, consolidation, dissolution, business
combination, reorganization or similar transaction involving the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries, in each case with respect to the foregoing
clauses (a) through (c), that could reasonably be expected to prevent or
materially delay the consummation of the Merger on or before the Drop Dead
Date.

 

Section 5\. ADDITIONAL AGREEMENTS OF THE PARTIES

 

5.1 Disclosure Documents; Merger Proposal; Registration.

 

(a) As promptly as practicable after the date of this Agreement, (i) Radiant
shall prepare and file with the SEC a proxy statement relating to the Radiant
Shareholder Meeting to be held in connection with the Merger (together with
any amendments thereof or supplements thereto, the "Proxy Statement") and (ii)
Radiant, in cooperation with the Company, shall prepare and file with the SEC
a registration statement on Form S-4 (the "Form S-4"), in which the Proxy
Statement shall be included as a part (the Proxy Statement and the Form S-4,
collectively, the "Registration Statement"), in connection with the
registration under the Securities Act of the shares of Radiant Common Stock
to be issued by virtue of the Merger. Each of Radiant and the Company shall
use their commercially reasonable efforts to cause the Registration Statement
to become effective as promptly as practicable, and shall take all or any
action required under any applicable federal, state, securities and other
Laws in connection with the issuance of shares of Radiant Common Stock
pursuant to the Merger. Each of Radiant, Merger Sub and the Company shall
furnish all information concerning itself and their Subsidiaries, as
applicable, to the other parties as the other parties may reasonably request
in connection with such actions and the preparation of the Registration
Statement and Proxy Statement. Except with respect to any information
regarding or provided by the Company, Radiant covenants and agrees that the
Registration Statement (and the letter to shareholders, notice of meeting and
form of proxy included therewith), as of the date it is mailed to its
shareholders and as of the date of the Radiant Shareholder Meeting, will not
contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material
fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the
statements made therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were
made, not misleading. The Company covenants and agrees that the information
supplied by the Company or its Subsidiaries to Radiant for inclusion in the
Registration Statement (including the Company Financial Statements) will
not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any
material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make such
information, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not
misleading. Radiant shall use commercially reasonable efforts to cause the
Proxy Statement to be mailed to its shareholders as promptly as practicable
after the Registration Statement is declared effective by the SEC. If Radiant,
Merger Sub or the Company become aware of any event or information that,
pursuant to the Securities Act or the Exchange Act, should be disclosed in an
amendment or supplement to the Registration Statement or Proxy Statement, as
the case may be, then such party, as the case may be, shall promptly inform
the other parties thereof and shall cooperate with such other parties in
filing such amendment or supplement with the SEC and, if appropriate, in
mailing such amendment or supplement to the Radiant Shareholders.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary stated above, prior to filing and
mailing, as applicable, the Registration Statement or Proxy Statement (or any
amendment or supplement thereto) or responding to any comments of the SEC with
respect thereto, Radiant shall provide the Company a reasonable opportunity
to review and comment on such document or response and shall discuss with the
Company and consider in good faith comments reasonably proposed by the
Company. Radiant will advise the Company, promptly after Radiant receives
notice thereof, of the time when the Registration Statement has become
effective or any supplement or amendment has been filed, of the issuance of
any stop order or the suspension of the qualification of Radiant Common
Stock for offering or sale in any jurisdiction, of the initiation or threat
of any proceeding for any such purpose, or of any request by the SEC for the
amendment or supplement of the Registration Statement or for additional
information. The Company shall reasonably cooperate with Radiant and provide
Radiant, and use its reasonable best efforts to cause its Representatives to

 provide, Radiant and its Representatives, advisors, accountants and
attorneys, with all information regarding the Company that is required by
legal requirement to be included in the Form S-4 or reasonably requested from
the Company to be included in the Form S-4 which information will not contain
any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact
required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements
made therein, in light of the circumstances, under which they were made, not
misleading.

 

(b) Subject to the ICL, as soon as reasonably practicable following the date
of this Agreement, each of the Company and Merger Sub shall (and Radiant
shall cause Merger Sub to), as applicable, take the following actions within
the timeframes set forth in this _Section_ __ _ 5.1(b)_: (i) as promptly as
practicable following the date hereof, cause a merger proposal (in the Hebrew
language) reflecting the Merger, the Contemplated Transactions and this
Agreement in a form complying with the ICL and reasonably acceptable to the
Parties (the "Merger Proposal") to be executed in accordance with Section 316
of the ICL; (ii) deliver the Merger Proposal to the Companies Registrar within

delivered to the Companies Registrar; (iv) (A) publish a notice to its
creditors in a form acceptable to the Parties, stating that a Merger Proposal
was submitted to the Companies Registrar and that the creditors may review the
Merger Proposal at the office of the Companies Registrar, the Companys
registered offices or Merger Subs registered offices, as applicable, and
at such other locations as the Company or Merger Sub, as applicable, may
determine, in (x) two daily Hebrew newspapers circulated in Israel, on the day
that the Merger Proposal is delivered to the Companies Registrar, and (y) in a
popular newspaper outside of Israel within three Business Days after the date
on which the Merger Proposal is delivered to the Companies Registrar if
required by applicable Law; (B) within four Business Days from the date of
submitting the Merger Proposal to the Companies Registrar, send a notice, in
a form acceptable to the Parties, by registered mail to all of its
"Substantial Creditors" (as such term is defined in the Israeli Companies
Regulations (Merger), 5760-2000 (the "Merger Regulations")) of which the
Company or Merger Sub, as applicable, is aware, in which it shall state that a
Merger Proposal was submitted to the Companies Registrar and that the
creditors may review the Merger Proposal at such additional locations, if
such locations were determined in the notice referred to in clause (A) above
and at such times stated in the notice referred to in clause (A) above; (C) if
required under the ICL, send to the Companys "workers committee", if any, or
display in a prominent place on the Companys premises a copy of the notice
published in a daily Hebrew newspaper (as referred to in clause (A) above), no
later than three Business Days following the day on which the Merger Proposal
was submitted to the Companies Registrar; (v) promptly after the Company and
Merger Sub, as applicable, shall have complied with the preceding clauses
(iii) and (iv) above, but in any event no more than three (3) days following
the date on which notice was sent to the creditors under clause (iii) above,
inform the Companies Registrar, in accordance with Section 317(b) of the ICL
and Regulation 5 of the Merger Regulations, that notice was given to their
respective creditors under Section 318 of the ICL; (vi) not later than three
(3) days after the date on which (x) the Company Shareholder Approval is
received and (y) the sole shareholder of Merger Sub approves the Merger, the
Contemplated Transactions and this Agreement, the Company or Merger Sub, as
applicable, shall inform (in accordance with Section 317(b) of ICL) the
Companies Registrar of such approval in a form acceptable to the Parties, and
(vii) following fulfillment or waiver of all of the conditions for Closing set
forth in _Section_ __ _ 6_, _Section_ __ _ 7_ and _Section_ __ _ 8_ of this
Agreement, inform the Companies Registrar of such fulfillment or waiver and,
in accordance with the customary practice of the Companies Registrar, request
that the Companies Registrar declare the Merger effective and issue the
Certificate of Merger upon such date, as the Company and Merger Sub shall
advise the Companies Registrar. For the avoidance of doubt, and
notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to the contrary, it is the
intention of the Parties that the Merger shall be declared effective and
the Certificate of Merger shall be issued on the Closing Date, as a condition
to the Closing taking place. For purposes of this _Section_ __ _ 5.1(b)_,
"Business Day" shall have the meaning set forth in the Merger Regulations.

(c) Concurrently with the Company Shareholder Meeting, the sole shareholder of
Merger Sub shall approve the Merger, the Contemplated Transactions and this
Agreement.

the Company shall take all action necessary in accordance with applicable Laws
and the Company Charter to call, give notice of, convene and hold a meeting
of the Company Shareholders (the "Company Shareholder Meeting") to consider
and vote on proposals to approve this Agreement, the Merger and the other
Contemplated Transactions (collectively, the "Company Shareholder
Proposals"). Notwithstanding anything else to the contrary herein, the Company
may postpone or adjourn the Company Shareholder Meeting (i) with the consent
of Radiant, (ii) for the absence of a quorum, or (iii) if the Company
reasonably determines that the failure to adjourn, postpone or delay the
Company Shareholder Meeting would be reasonably likely not to allow sufficient
time for the distribution of any required or appropriate supplement or
amendment to the Company Shareholder Meeting Notice. The Board of Directors of
the Company has recommended that the Company Shareholders approve the Company
Shareholder Proposals (the "Company Recommendation"). The Company
shall ensure that all proxies solicited in connection with the Company
Shareholder Meeting are solicited in material compliance with all applicable
Laws. All materials (including any amendments thereto) submitted to the
shareholders of the Company in accordance with this _Section_ __ _ 5.2(a)
_shall be subject to Radiants review and the Company shall consider in good
faith all reasonable comments proposed by Radiant.

 

(b) _Radiant Shareholder Meeting_. As promptly as practicable after the
Registration Statement has been declared effective under the Securities Act,
Radiant shall take all action necessary in accordance with applicable Laws and
the Radiant Charter and Radiant Bylaws to promptly call, give notice of,
convene and hold a meeting of the Radiant Shareholders (the
"Radiant Shareholder Meeting") to consider and vote on proposals to approve
(i) an amendment to the Radiant Charter to effect a reverse stock split of the
Radiant Common Stock at a ratio between 1 to 10 and 1 to 15 (the "Reverse
Stock Split"), to be determined at the discretion of the Radiant Board of
Directors, subject to the Radiant Board of Directors discretion to abandon
such amendment, (ii) the issuance of the shares of Radiant Common Stock by
virtue of the Merger and the Post-Closing Financing, (iii) an increase in the
number of shares of Radiant Common Stock to the number necessary to issue the

and (2) by the Radiant Post-Closing Financing, and (iv) an amendment to
Radiants 2017 Incentive Award Plan, as amended, increasing the amount of
shares of Radiant Common Stock issuable thereunder with share amounts
recommended by the Companys Board of Directors or a committee thereof
(collectively, the "Radiant Shareholder Proposals") provided, that Radiant
shall use commercially reasonable efforts to hold the Radiant Shareholder
Meeting no later than sixty (60) days following the date that the
Registration Statement has been declared effective under the Securities Act.
In addition, in accordance with Section 14A of the Exchange Act and the
applicable SEC rules issued thereunder, Radiant shall seek advisory approval
of a proposal to the Radiant Shareholders for a non-binding, advisory vote to
approve certain compensation that may become payable to Radiants named
executive officers in connection with the completion of the Merger.
Notwithstanding anything else to the contrary herein, Radiant may postpone or
adjourn the Radiant Shareholder Meeting (i) with the consent of the Company,
(ii) for the absence of a quorum, (iii) if Radiant reasonably determines that
the failure to adjourn, postpone or delay the Radiant Shareholder Meeting
would not allow sufficient time under applicable Laws for the distribution of
any required or appropriate supplement or amendment to the Registration
Statement or Proxy Statement, (iv) to allow additional solicitation of votes
in order to obtain the Radiant Shareholder Approval or (v) in connection with
a Radiant Change of Recommendation. Unless the Board of Directors of Radiant
has effected a Radiant Change of Recommendation in accordance with _Section_
__ _ 4.5_ and terminated this Agreement to enter into a definitive agreement
with respect to a Radiant Superior Offer pursuant to  _Section_ __ _ 9.1(i)
_and except as required under applicable Law, Radiants obligation to call,
give notice of and hold the Radiant Shareholder Meeting in accordance with
_Section_ _ 5.2(b)_ shall not be limited or otherwise affected by the
commencement, disclosure, announcement or submission of any Radiant
Acquisition Proposal, or by any Radiant Change of Recommendation. Except in
the case of a Radiant Change of Recommendation made in compliance with
_Section_ __ _ 4.5(d)_ or _Section_ __ _ 4.5(e)_, Radiant agrees that the
Board of Directors of Radiant shall recommend that the

 Radiant Shareholders approve the Radiant Shareholder Proposals (the "Radiant
Recommendation") and Radiant shall include such Radiant Recommendation in the
Proxy Statement. Except in the case of a Radiant Change of Recommendation
made in compliance with _Section_ __ _ 4.5(d)_ or _Section_ __ _ 4.5(e)_,
Radiant shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to solicit from the
Radiant Shareholders proxies in favor of the Radiant Shareholder Proposals
and shall take all other action necessary or advisable to secure the Radiant
Shareholder Approvals. Radiant shall ensure that all proxies solicited in
connection with the Radiant Shareholder Meetings are solicited in material
compliance with all applicable Laws. Radiant, in its capacity as the sole
shareholder of Merger Sub, shall approve the Merger.

 

5.3 Regulatory Approvals. Each Party shall use reasonable best efforts to file
or otherwise submit, as soon as practicable after the date of this Agreement
but no later than required by applicable Law, all applications, notices,
reports and other documents reasonably required to be filed by such Party with
or otherwise submitted by such Party to any Governmental Authority with
respect to the Merger and the other Contemplated Transactions, and to submit
promptly any additional information requested by any such Governmental
Authority. Each Party shall utilize reasonable best efforts to
cooperate fully with the other Party in promptly seeking to obtain all such
required consents, authorizations, orders and approvals. The Parties hereto
shall not take any action that will have the effect of delaying, impairing or
impeding the receipt of any required consents, authorizations, orders and
approvals. The Parties shall each use their reasonable best efforts to resist
any assertion that the transactions contemplated hereby constitute a violation
of antitrust or merger control Laws, rules or regulations. All filing fees
which are due and owing upon respective filings under antitrust or merger
control Laws shall be shared equally between the Company and Radiant. All
analyses, appearances, meetings, discussions, presentations,
memoranda, briefs, filings, arguments, and proposals made by or on behalf of
either Party before any Governmental Authority or the staff or regulators of
any Governmental Authority with respect to the Merger and the other
Contemplated Transactions, in connection with the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement shall be disclosed to counsel for the other Party hereunder
in advance of any filing, submission or attendance, it being the intent that
the Parties will consult and cooperate with one another, and consider in good
faith the views of one another, in connection with any such analyses,
appearances, meetings, discussions, presentations, memoranda, briefs, filings,
arguments, and proposals. Each Party may, as it deems advisable
and necessary, reasonably designate material provided to the other party as
"Outside Counsel Only Material," and also may reasonably redact the material
as necessary to (a) remove personally sensitive information, (b)
remove references concerning the valuation of the Company and its
Subsidiaries or Radiant and its Subsidiaries conducted in connection with the
approval and adoption of this Agreement and the negotiations and
investigations leading thereto, (c) comply with contractual arrangements, (d)
prevent the loss of a legal privilege or (e) comply with applicable Law. To
the extent reasonably practicable, each Party shall give notice to counsel for
the other party with respect to any meeting, discussion, appearance or
contact with any Governmental Authority or the staff or regulators of any
Governmental Authority with respect to the Merger and the other Contemplated
Transactions, with such notice being sufficient to provide the other party
with the opportunity to attend and participate in such meeting, discussion,
appearance or contact. In the event that any Legal Proceeding is commenced
challenging the Merger or any of the other Contemplated Transactions under
antitrust, competition or merger control Laws, and such Legal Proceeding
seeks, or would reasonably be expected to seek, to prevent the consummation of
all or part of the Merger or the other Contemplated Transactions, the Parties
shall cooperate with each other and use their respective best efforts to
contest any such Legal Proceeding and to have vacated, lifted, reversed, or
overturned any decree, judgment, injunction or other Order, whether temporary,
preliminary, or permanent, that is in effect and that prohibits, prevents or
restricts consummation of the Merger or the other Contemplated Transactions;
provided that nothing in this sentence shall require any Party to divest any
assets it owns as of the date hereof to the extent such divestiture would
have a material and adverse effect on the businesses of the combined company
following consummation of the Merger, taken as a whole.

 

5.4 Company Options and Company Warrants.

 

(a) At the Effective Time, each Company Option that is outstanding and
unexercised immediately prior to the Effective Time whether or not vested,
shall be converted into and become an option to purchase

 



63

   ##### Table of Contents

   

 

 Radiant Common Stock, and Radiant shall assume the Company Option Plan and
each such Company Option in accordance with its terms (as in effect as of the
date of this Agreement). All rights with respect to Company Ordinary Shares
under Company Options assumed by Radiant shall thereupon be converted into
rights with respect to Radiant Common Stock. Accordingly, from and after the
Effective Time: (i) each Company Option assumed by Radiant may be exercised
solely for shares of Radiant Common Stock; (ii) the number of shares of
Radiant Common Stock subject to each Company Option assumed by Radiant shall
be determined by multiplying (A) the number of shares of Company Ordinary
Shares that were subject to such Company Option, as in effect immediately
prior to the Effective Time by (B) the Exchange Ratio and rounding the
resulting number down to the nearest whole number of shares of Radiant Common
Stock; (iii) the per share exercise price for the Radiant Common Stock
issuable upon exercise of each Company Option assumed by Radiant shall be
determined by dividing (A) the per share exercise price of Company Ordinary
Shares subject to such Company Option, as in effect immediately prior to the
Effective Time, by (B) the Exchange Ratio and rounding the resulting exercise
price up to the nearest whole cent; and (iv) any restriction on the exercise
of any Company Option assumed by Radiant shall continue in full force and
effect and the term, exercisability, vesting schedule and other provisions of
such Company Option shall otherwise remain unchanged; _provided_ _,_ _however_
, that: (A) to the extent provided under the terms of a Company Option, each
Company Option assumed by Radiant in accordance with this _Section_ __ _
5.4(a)_ shall, in accordance with its terms, be subject to further adjustment
as appropriate to reflect any stock split, division or subdivision of shares,
stock dividend, reverse stock split, consolidation of shares,
reclassification, recapitalization or other similar transaction with respect
to Radiant Common Stock subsequent to the Effective Time; and (B) Radiants
Board of Directors or a committee thereof shall succeed to the authority and
responsibility of Companys Board of Directors or any committee thereof with
respect to each Company Option assumed by Radiant. Notwithstanding anything
to the contrary in this _Section_ __ _ 5.4(a)_, the conversion of each
Company Option (regardless of whether such option qualifies as an "incentive
stock option" within the meaning of Section 422 of the Code) into an option
to purchase shares of Radiant Common Stock shall be made in a manner
consistent with Treasury Regulation Section 1.424-1, such that the conversion
of a Company Option shall not constitute a "modification" of such Company
Option for purposes of Section 409A or Section 424 of the Code.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this _Section_ __ _ 5.4(a)_, the
conversion of the Company Options that are Company 102 Options into options
to purchase Radiant Common Stock shall be effected subject to and in
accordance with the Options Tax Ruling and the Ordinance and applicable Law to
ensure that the options to purchase Radiant Common Stock shall enjoy the tax
benefits set forth in the Options Tax Ruling.

(b) At the Effective Time, each Company Warrant that is outstanding and
unexercised immediately prior to the Effective Time, whether or not
exercisable, shall be converted into and become a warrant to purchase Radiant
Common Stock, and Radiant shall assume each such Company Warrant in accordance
with its terms (as in effect as of the date of this Agreement). All rights
with respect to Company Ordinary Shares or Company Preferred Shares under
Company Warrants assumed by Radiant shall thereupon be converted into rights
with respect to Radiant Common Stock. Accordingly, from and after the
Effective Time: (i) each Company Warrant assumed by Radiant may be exercised
solely for shares of Radiant Common Stock; (ii) the number of shares of
Radiant Common Stock subject to each Company Warrant assumed by Radiant shall
be determined by multiplying (A) the number of shares of Company Ordinary
Shares or Company Preferred Shares that were subject to such Company Warrant,
as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time by (B) the Exchange
Ratio and rounding the resulting number down to the nearest whole number of
shares of Radiant Common Stock; (iii) the per share exercise price for the
Radiant Common Stock issuable upon exercise of each Company Warrant assumed
by Radiant shall be determined by dividing (A) the per share exercise price of
Company Ordinary Shares or the Company Preferred Shares subject to such
Company Warrant, as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time, by (B)
the Exchange Ratio and rounding the resulting exercise price up to the nearest
whole cent; and (iv) any restriction on the exercise of any Company Warrant
assumed by Radiant shall continue in full force and effect and the
term, exercisability, vesting schedule and other provisions of such Company
Warrant shall otherwise remain unchanged; _provided_ , _however_ , that to the
extent provided under the terms of a Company Warrant, such Company Warrant
assumed by Radiant in accordance with this _Section_ __ _ 5.4(b)_ shall, in
accordance with its terms, be subject to further adjustment as appropriate to
reflect any stock split, division or subdivision of shares, stock dividend,
reverse stock split, consolidation of shares, reclassification,

 recapitalization or other similar transaction with respect to Radiant Common
Stock subsequent to the Effective Time.

 

(c) Radiant shall file with the SEC promptly following the Effective Time, a

of Radiant Common Stock issuable with respect to Company Options assumed by
Radiant in accordance with _Section_ __ _ 5.4(a)_.

 

(d) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall take all actions that may
be reasonably necessary (under the Company Option Plan, the Company Warrants
and otherwise) to effectuate the provisions of this _Section_ __ _ 5.4_.

(e) _15D Exemption_. Radiant shall use its reasonable best efforts to obtain
promptly following the Effective Time from the Israel Securities Authority
("ISA") an exemption under Section 15D of the Israeli Securities Law,
5728-1968, such that the conversion and assumption of the Company Options by
Radiant as set forth in _Section_ __ _ 5.4(a) _shall not be deemed to be an
"offer to the public" under such law or require a prospectus approved by
the ISA (the "15D Exemption"). The Company and Radiant shall cooperate to
comply with the terms of the 15D Exemption.

 

(f) Following the Effective Time, Radiant will promptly enter into a warrant
agreement with each holder of Company Warrants to reflect the exchange
described in this _Section_ __ _ 5.4_ and such warrant agreement shall be
consistent in all reasonable material respects with the terms and conditions
of the Warrant Issuance Agreement, dated as of October 11, 2016, by and
between the Company and Madryn Health Partners, LP (f/k/a Visium Healthcare
Partners, LP), if such holder of Company Warrants is a party to such
agreement.

 

5.5 Radiant Stock Options. At the Effective Time, each Radiant Stock Option or
Radiant restricted stock award that is outstanding and unexercised
immediately prior to the Effective Time, whether or not vested, shall be
continued and survive the Closing and remain outstanding in accordance with
its terms without acceleration or adjustment under the terms of the Radiant
Stock Option Plans by reason of the Contemplated Transactions.

5.6 Indemnification of Officers and Directors.

(a) Subject to applicable Law, from the Effective Time through the seventh
anniversary of the date on which the Effective Time occurs, each of Radiant
and the Surviving Company shall indemnify and hold harmless each person who is
now, or has been at any time prior to the date hereof, or who becomes prior to
the Effective Time, a director or officer of Radiant and its Subsidiaries or
the Company and its Subsidiaries, respectively (the "DandO Indemnified
Parties"), against all claims, losses, liabilities, damages, judgments, fines
and reasonable fees, costs and expenses, including attorneys fees and
disbursements, incurred in connection with any claim, action, suit, proceeding
or investigation, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative,
arising out of or pertaining to the fact that the DandO Indemnified Party is or
was a director or officer of Radiant or of the Company or any of their
Subsidiaries (each, a "Proceeding"), whether asserted or claimed prior to, at
or after the Effective Time, in each case, to the fullest extent permitted
under applicable Law. Subject to applicable law, each DandO Indemnified Party
will be entitled to advancement of expenses incurred in the defense of any
Proceeding from each of Radiant and the Surviving Company, jointly and
severally, upon receipt by Radiant or the Surviving Company from the DandO
Indemnified Party of a request therefor; _provided_ that any such person to
whom expenses are advanced provides an undertaking to Radiant or the Surviving
Company, as applicable, to the extent then required by applicable Law, to
repay such advances if it is ultimately determined that such person is not
entitled to indemnification. The provisions of the Radiant Charter and Radiant
Bylaws with respect to indemnification, advancement of expenses and
exculpation of present and former directors and officers of Radiant that are
presently set forth in the Radiant Charter and Radiant Bylaws shall not be
amended, modified or repealed for a period of seven (7) years from the
Effective Time in a manner that would adversely affect the rights thereunder
of individuals who, at or prior to the Effective Time, were officers or
directors of Radiant, unless such modification is required by applicable Law.
To the extent permitted by applicable Law, the articles

Parties, with respect to claims arising out of matters occurring at or prior
to the Effective Time and (ii) Radiant shall fulfill and honor in all respects
the obligations of Radiant to DandO Indemnified Parties as of immediately prior

the date of this Agreement, with respect to claims arising out of matters
occurring at or prior to the Effective Time.

 

(b) From and after the Effective Time, Radiant shall maintain directors and
officers liability insurance policies, with an effective date as of the

prepaid "DandO tail policy" for the non-cancellable extension of the directors
and officers liability coverage of Radiants existing directors and
officers insurance policies and Radiants existing fiduciary liability
insurance policies for the Persons who, as of the date of this Agreement are

(d) The provisions of this _Section_ __ _ 5.6_ are intended to be in addition
to the rights otherwise available to the current and former officers and
directors of Radiant and the Company by law, charter, statute, bylaw or
agreement, and shall operate for the benefit of, and shall be enforceable by,
each of the DandO Indemnified Parties, their heirs and their representatives.
In the event Radiant or the Surviving Company or any of their respective
successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any other Person
and shall not be the continuing or surviving corporation or entity of
such consolidation or merger, or (ii) transfers all or substantially all of
its properties and assets to any Person, then, and in each such case, proper
provision shall be made so that the successors and assigns of Radiant or the
Surviving Company, as the case may be, shall succeed to the obligations set
forth in this _Section_ __ _ 5.6_. Radiant shall cause the Surviving Company
to perform all of the obligations of the Surviving Company under this

(e) The covenants contained in this _Section_ __ _ 5.6_ are intended to be

agree not to, and not to permit or cause any Affiliate or any Subsidiary

 



67

   ##### Table of Contents

   

 

 to, take any actions or cause any action to be taken that would reasonably
be expected to prevent the Merger from qualifying as a "reorganization" under
Section 368(a) of the Code. 

(b) This Agreement is intended to constitute, and the parties hereto hereby
adopt this Agreement as, a "plan of reorganization" within the meaning
Treasury Regulation Sections 1.368-2(g) and 1.368-3(a). Radiant, Merger Sub
and the Company shall treat, and shall not take any tax reporting position
inconsistent with the treatment of, the Merger as a "reorganization" within
the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code for U.S. federal, state and other
relevant Tax purposes, unless otherwise required pursuant to a
"determination" within the meaning of Section 1313(a) of the Code.

(c) All transfer, documentary, sales, use, stamp, registration and other such
Taxes and fees (including any penalties and interest) incurred in connection
with this Agreement (collectively, "Transfer Taxes") shall be paid (or cause
to be paid) by Radiant when due, and Radiant will, at its own expense, file
(or cause to be filed) all necessary Tax Returns and other documentation with
respect to all such Transfer Taxes.

 

(d) As soon as reasonably practicable after the date of this Agreement, the
Company shall instruct its Israeli counsel, advisors and/or accountants to
prepare and file with the ITA an application for rulings (collectively, the
"Options Tax Ruling") confirming that (i) the deemed transfer of the Company
102 Shares and payment or delivery of the Merger Consideration for such
shares in accordance with _Section_ __ _ 1.5(a)(i)_ and conversion of the
Company 102 Options in accordance with _Section_ __ _ 5.4(a)_ shall not be
regarded as a violation of the "requisite holding period" (as such term is
defined in Section 102 of the Ordinance) so long as the Merger Consideration
for the Company 102 Shares and options into which the Company 102 Options are
converted (and shares issued upon the exercise thereof) are deposited with
the 102 Trustee until the end of their applicable holding period under Section
102 of the Ordinance, (ii) the Merger Consideration for the Company 102 Shares
and options into which the Company 102 Options are converted shall continue,
after the Effective Time, to benefit from the provisions of Section 102 of the
Ordinance and to qualify thereunder as grants made through a trustee pursuant
to the capital gains tax route according to Section 102(b)(2) of the
Ordinance, and (iii) the exchange of Company Options granted pursuant to
Section 3(i) of the Ordinance for options to purchase shares of Radiant Common
Stock shall not be subject to payment of Israeli Tax until the exercise of
such Company Option (which ruling may be subject to customary conditions and
adjustments regularly associated with such a ruling). The Company shall
include in the request for the Options Tax Ruling a request to exempt
Radiant, the Surviving Company, the Exchange Agent and their respective
agents from any withholding obligation in relation to any payments and
deliveries made with respect to any Company 102 Shares or the conversion of
Company 102 Options. The Company shall use reasonable best efforts to obtain
the Options Tax Ruling prior to the Closing. If the Options Tax Ruling is not
granted prior to the Closing, or in accordance with the instructions of the
ITA, the Company shall seek to obtain prior to the Closing an interim tax
ruling confirming, among other things, that Radiant, the Surviving Company,
the Exchange Agent and their respective agents and any other Person acting on
their behalf shall be exempt from Israeli withholding tax in relation to any
payments and deliveries made with respect to any Company 102 Shares or the
conversion of Company 102 Options to the Exchange Agent, the 102 Trustee or
the Surviving Company in connection with the Merger (the "Interim Options
Tax Ruling"). To the extent that prior to the Closing an Interim Options Tax
Ruling shall have been obtained, then all references herein to the Options Tax
Ruling shall be deemed to refer to such Interim Options Tax Ruling, until such
time that a final definitive Options Tax Ruling is obtained.

(e) As soon as reasonably practicable following the date of this
Agreement, the Company shall instruct its Israeli counsel, advisors and/or
accountants to prepare and file with the ITA an application for a ruling
(collectively, the "Withholding Tax Ruling") that (i) stipulates that the
transfer of any Merger Consideration or consideration contemplated under
_Section 5.4_ to the Exchange Agent or 102 Trustee is not subject to a tax
withholding obligation, or clarifies that no such obligation exists; (ii) with
respect to holders of record of Company Share Capital (other than Company 102
Shares), Company Options (other than Company 102 Options or any other Company
Options covered by the Options Tax Ruling) and Company Warrants, in each case,
that are non-Israeli residents (as defined in Israeli Tax Law), exempts
Radiant, the Exchange Agent, the Surviving Company and their respective agents
from any obligation to withhold Israeli Tax from any consideration payable

 or otherwise deliverable pursuant to this Agreement, including, without
limitation, the Merger Consideration, or clarifies that no such obligation
exists, all in accordance with the terms of the Withholding Tax Ruling; and
(iii) with respect to holders of record of Company Share Capital (other than
Company 102 Shares) and Company Options (other than Company 102 Options or any
other Company Options covered by the Options Tax Ruling) and Company Warrants

Radiant, the Exchange Agent, the Surviving Company and their respective agents
from any obligation to withhold Israeli Tax from any consideration payable
or otherwise deliverable pursuant to this Agreement, including, without
limitation, the Merger Consideration, or clarifies that no such obligation
exists, in each case as of the Effective Time and/or (B) instructs Radiant,
the Exchange Agent, the Surviving Company and their respective agents as to
the dates upon which such withholding is to be executed and on how such
withholding is to be executed with respect to holders of record of Company
Share Capital (other than Company 102 Shares), Company Options (other than
Company 102 Options or any other Company Options covered by the Options Tax
Ruling) and Company Warrants and the rate or rates of withholding tax to be
applied, in each case, in accordance with Section 104(H) of the Ordinance.

(f) Without limiting the generality of _Section_ __ _ 5.10(d)_, and 
_Section_ __ _ 5.10(e)_, each of the Company and Radiant shall cause their
respective Israeli counsel, advisors and accountants to coordinate all
material activities, and to cooperate with each other, with respect to
the preparation and filing of such applications and in the preparation of any
written or oral submissions that may be necessary, proper or advisable to
obtain the Options Tax Ruling (including the Interim Options Tax Ruling) and
the Withholding Tax Ruling. The final text of the Interim Options Tax Ruling,
the Options Tax Ruling and the Withholding Tax Ruling and any application
submitted to the ITA with respect to any Tax ruling, shall be subject to the
prior written consent of Radiant or its counsel, which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed. Subject to the terms and
conditions hereof, the Company shall use reasonable best efforts to promptly
take, or cause to be taken, all actions and to do, or cause to be done, all
things necessary, proper or advisable under applicable Laws to obtain the
Interim Options Tax Ruling, the Options Tax Ruling and the Withholding Tax
Ruling, as promptly as practicable. The Company shall keep Radiant reasonably
informed of all material developments and events relating to the Interim
Options Tax Ruling, the Options Tax Ruling and the Withholding Tax Ruling
(including promptly forwarding copies to Radiant of any related
correspondence, and shall provide Radiant with an opportunity to review and
comment on any material correspondence before the Company sends such
correspondence to the ITA).

(g) Cooperation. Each Party shall cooperate reasonably with the other Party
and shall provide the other Party with such assistance as may be reasonably
requested for the purpose of facilitating the performance by each Party of
their obligations under this Agreement, to cause the Closing to occur as
promptly as reasonably possible and to enable the combined entity to continue
to meet its obligations following the Closing.

 

5.11 Directors and Officers.

 

(a) The Parties shall use reasonable best efforts and take all necessary
action so that the Board of Directors of Radiant consists of nine (9)
directors, out of which two (2) directors shall be identified by Radiant to
the Company as the "Radiant Appointees" and seven (7) directors shall be
identified by the Company to Radiant as the "Company Appointees", each no
later than fifteen (15) Business Days prior to filing of the Proxy Statement,
to serve in such positions effective as of the Effective Time until successors
are duly elected or appointed and qualified in accordance with applicable

being directors of Radiant to cease to hold such inconsistent position,
including via termination of such Persons positions. If any Radiant
Appointee or Company Appointee is unable or unwilling to serve as director of
Radiant, the Party appointing such Person shall designate a successor;
_provided_ , _however_ , the Parties acknowledge that so long as
Radiant remains a public reporting company, the Board of Directors of Radiant
will continue to satisfy applicable securities laws, including, without
limitation, maintaining an independent audit committee, and the nominations by
Company and Radiant hereunder will allow Radiant to comply with such
applicable Law. Each new member of the Board of Directors of Radiant that was
