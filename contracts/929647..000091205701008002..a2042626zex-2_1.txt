iii     AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER   This AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER
(this "Agreement"), dated as of March 21, 2001, is entered into by and among
Price Enterprises, Inc., a Maryland corporation ("Enterprises"), PEI Merger
Sub, Inc., a Maryland corporation ("Merger Sub"), and Excel Legacy
Corporation, a Delaware corporation ("Legacy").   RECITALS   WHEREAS, the
Boards of Directors of Legacy, Enterprises and Merger Sub have each
determined that the Merger (as hereinafter defined) is in the best interests
of their respective companies and their stockholders and presents an
opportunity for their respective companies to achieve long-term strategic and
financial benefits, and accordingly have agreed to effect the Merger provided
for herein upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth herein;  
WHEREAS, for federal income tax purposes, it is intended that the Merger
shall qualify as a reorganization within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the
Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code");   WHEREAS,
concurrently with the execution of this Agreement and as a condition of the
willingness of Enterprises to enter into this Agreement, Enterprises and
certain principal stockholders of Legacy (the "Principal Stockholders") have
entered into a stockholders agreement dated as of the date hereof (the
"Stockholders Agreement") pursuant to which, among other things,
the Principal Stockholders have agreed to vote their shares of Legacy Common
Stock (as hereinafter defined) in favor of the Merger, upon the terms and
subject to the conditions set forth in the Stockholders Agreement;  
WHEREAS, each of Enterprises and Legacy has received a fairness opinion
relating to the transactions contemplated hereby as more fully described
herein; and   WHEREAS, Legacy, Enterprises and Merger Sub desire to
make certain representations, warranties and agreements in connection with
the Merger.   AGREEMENT   NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the
foregoing, and of the representations, warranties, covenants and agreements
contained herein, the parties hereto hereby agree as follows:   ARTICLE 1 
THE MERGER   1.1 THE MERGER. Subject to the terms and conditions of this
Agreement and in accordance with the Maryland General Corporation Law
("MGCL") and the Delaware General Corporation Law ("DGCL"), at the Effective
Time (as hereinafter defined), Merger Sub shall be merged with and into
Legacy (the "Merger"), the separate corporate existence of Merger Sub shall
thereupon cease and Legacy shall continue as the surviving corporation.
Legacy, as the   1   surviving corporation after the Merger, is
hereinafter sometimes referred to as the "Surviving Corporation."   1.2 THE
CLOSING. Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, the closing
of the Merger (the "Closing") shall take place (a) at the offices of Latham and
Watkins in San Diego, California, at 9:00 a.m., Pacific time, on the second
business day immediately following the day on which the last to be fulfilled
or waived of the conditions set forth in Article 7 shall be fulfilled or
waived in accordance herewith or (b) at such other time, date or place
as Legacy, Enterprises and Merger Sub may agree. The date on which the
Closing occurs is hereinafter referred to as the "Closing Date." As used
herein, "business day" shall mean a day on which banks are not required or
authorized to close in the City of San Diego.   1.3 EFFECTIVE TIME. The
Merger shall become effective as set forth in the certificate or articles of
merger (the "Certificate of Merger") which shall be filed with the Secretary
of State of the State of Delaware (the "Delaware Secretary") and the State
Department of Assessments and Taxation of Maryland (the "Maryland DAT") on
the Closing Date. The term "Effective Time" shall be the date and time when
the Merger becomes effective, as set forth in the Certificate of Merger.  
1.4 EFFECTS OF THE MERGER. At and after the Effective Time, the Merger shall
have the effects set forth in the MGCL and DGCL.   1.5 TAX CONSEQUENCES. It
is intended that the Merger shall constitute a reorganization within the
meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code, and that this Agreement shall
constitute a "plan of reorganization" within the meaning of Treasury
Regulations Section 1.368-2(g).   1.6 RESTRUCTURE OF TRANSACTION. After
consulting with their tax advisors, the parties shall have the right to
revise the structure of the Merger (including providing for the merger of
Legacy with and into Merger Sub); provided, that no such revision to the
structure of the Merger shall (a) cause the Merger to fail to qualify as a
reorganization within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code, (b) result
in any change in the amount or type of consideration which the holders of
shares of Legacy Common Stock are entitled to receive under this Agreement,
(c) be materially adverse to the interests of Enterprises, Merger Sub,
Legacy, the holders of shares of Legacy Common Stock or the holders of shares
of Enterprises Common Stock (as hereinafter defined) or Enterprises Preferred
Stock (as hereinafter defined) or (d) unreasonably impede or delay
consummation of the Merger. If the parties exercise this right of revision,
this Agreement shall be deemed automatically amended by the parties
as appropriate to give effect to the revised structure of the Merger with
each party executing a written amendment to this Agreement as necessary to
reflect the foregoing.   ARTICLE 2  THE SURVIVING CORPORATION   2.1
CERTIFICATE OF INCORPORATION. The certificate of incorporation, as amended,
of Legacy (the "Legacy Certificate") in effect immediately prior to
the Effective Time shall be the   2   certificate of incorporation of
the Surviving Corporation, until duly amended in accordance with applicable
law.   2.2 BYLAWS. The bylaws, as amended, of Legacy (the "Legacy Bylaws")
in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be the bylaws of
the Surviving Corporation, until duly amended in accordance with applicable
law.   2.3 DIRECTORS. As of the Effective Time, the Board of Directors of
the Surviving Corporation shall be reconstituted to have four (4) members,
two (2) to be designated by Enterprises and two (2) to be designated by
Legacy, so that the persons listed on EXHIBIT A hereto shall become the
directors of the Surviving Corporation as of the Effective Time. In the event
that prior to the Effective Time any person designated on EXHIBIT A is unable
or unwilling to serve as a director of the Surviving Corporation, then
Enterprises shall designate the replacement for any such persons who are
designated by Enterprises, and Legacy shall designate the replacement for any
such persons who are designated by Legacy and in each such case, such
replacement designees shall be treated as if set forth on EXHIBIT A as of the
date hereof in place of the person for whom he or she has been designated as
a replacement.   2.4 OFFICERS. The persons listed on EXHIBIT B hereto with
their respective titles shall be the officers of the Surviving Corporation as
of the Effective Time. In the event that prior to the Effective Time any
person designated on EXHIBIT B is unable or unwilling to serve as an officer
of the Surviving Corporation, Enterprises and Legacy shall mutually determine
the person or persons to serve as such officer in replacement for such
person.   ARTICLE 3  EFFECT OF THE MERGER ON THE CAPITAL STOCK OF THE
CONSTITUENT  CORPORATIONS; EXCHANGE OF CERTIFICATES   3.1 EFFECT ON CAPITAL
STOCK. By virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of
Enterprises, Legacy, Merger Sub or the stockholders of any of the foregoing,
the shares of the constituent corporations shall be converted as follows:  
(a) At the Effective Time, each share of common stock, par value  $0.0001 per
share, of Enterprises ("Enterprises Common Stock"), and each  share of 8 3/4%
Series A Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Stock, par value  $0.0001 per share,
of Enterprises ("Enterprises Preferred Stock") issued  and outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall remain  outstanding and shall
continue to represent one (1) share of Enterprises  Common Stock and one (1)
share of Enterprises Preferred Stock, as the case  may be.   (b) At the
Effective Time, each share of common stock, par value $0.01  per share, of
Merger Sub issued and outstanding immediately prior to the  Effective Time
shall cease to be outstanding and shall be converted into  one (1) share of
Legacy Common Stock.   (c) At the Effective Time, each share of common
stock, par value $0.01  per share, of Legacy ("Legacy Common Stock") issued
and outstanding  immediately prior to the Effective Time (excluding shares
held by Legacy,  Enterprises or any Subsidiary (as hereinafter    3   
defined) of Legacy or Enterprises) shall cease to be outstanding and shall 
be automatically converted into and exchanged for the right to receive 
0.6667 (the "Exchange Ratio") of a share of Enterprises Common Stock (the 
"Merger Consideration"). Each holder of a certificate (a "Certificate") 
representing any shares of Legacy Common Stock shall thereafter cease to 
have any rights with respect to such shares of Legacy Common Stock, except 
for the right to receive, without interest, a certificate representing the 
Merger Consideration and cash in lieu of fractional shares of Enterprises 
Common Stock in accordance with Section 3.2(e) hereof upon the surrender of 
such Certificate.   (d) The Exchange Ratio and corresponding number of
shares of  Enterprises Common Stock to be issued in the Merger shall be
appropriately  adjusted to reflect the effect of any stock split, reverse
stock split,  stock dividend, reorganization, recapitalization or other like
change with  respect to the Enterprises Common Stock or Legacy Common Stock
occurring  after the date hereof and prior to the Effective Time (subject,
however, to  Sections 6.3(b)(v) and 6.3(c)(v) hereof).   (e) Each issued
and outstanding share of Legacy Common Stock held by  Legacy, Enterprises or
any Subsidiary of Legacy or Enterprises shall be  cancelled or retired at the
Effective Time and no consideration shall be  issued in exchange
therefor.   (f) At the Effective Time, each 9.0% Convertible Redeemable 
Subordinated Secured Debenture due 2004 of Legacy ("Debenture") and each 
10.0% Senior Redeemable Secured Note due 2004 of Legacy ("Note") issued and 
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall remain  outstanding
and shall continue to represent a Debenture and a Note, as the  case may be,
of the Surviving Corporation; provided, however, that the  Debentures shall
be convertible into shares of Enterprises Common Stock in  accordance with
their terms and as appropriately adjusted to give effect to  the Merger.  
(g) At the Effective Time, each option to purchase shares of Legacy  Common
Stock (each, a "Legacy Option") granted by Legacy, which is  outstanding at
the Effective Time, whether or not exercisable, shall be  converted into and
become an option to purchase shares of Enterprises  Common Stock, and
Enterprises shall assume each Legacy Option in accordance  with the terms of
Legacy\'s 1998 Stock Option Plan, except that from and  after the Effective
Time, (i) Enterprises and its Compensation Committee  shall be substituted
for Legacy and its Compensation Committee, (ii) each  Legacy Option assumed
by Enterprises may be exercised solely for shares of  Enterprises Common
Stock (or cash, if so provided under the terms of such  Legacy Option), (iii)
the number of shares of Enterprises Common Stock  subject to such Legacy
Option shall be equal to the number of shares of  Legacy Common Stock subject
to such Legacy Option immediately prior to the  Effective Time multiplied by
the Exchange Ratio and (iv) the per share  exercise price under each such
Legacy Option shall be adjusted by dividing  the per share exercise price
under each such Legacy Option by the Exchange  Ratio and rounding up to the
nearest cent. Notwithstanding the provisions  of clause (iii) of the
preceding sentence, Enterprises shall not be  obligated to issue any fraction
of a share of Enterprises Common Stock upon  exercise of a Legacy Option and
any fraction of a share of Enterprises  Common Stock that otherwise would be
subject to a converted Legacy Option  shall represent the right to receive a
cash payment upon exercise of such  converted Legacy Option equal to the
product of such    4    fraction and the difference between the market
value of one share of  Enterprises Common Stock at the time of exercise of
such Legacy Option and  the per share exercise price of such Legacy Option.
Notwithstanding the  provisions of clauses (iii) and (iv) of this Section
3.1(g), each Legacy  Option which is an "incentive stock option" shall be
adjusted as required  by Section 424 of the Code, and the regulations
promulgated thereunder, so  as not to constitute a modification, extension or
renewal of the Legacy  Option, within the meaning of Section 424(h) of the
Code.   3.2 EXCHANGE OF CERTIFICATES.   (a) Promptly after the Effective
Time, Enterprises shall deposit, or  shall cause to be deposited, with an
exchange agent selected by  Enterprises, which shall be Enterprises\'
transfer agent or another party  reasonably satisfactory to Legacy (the
"Exchange Agent"), for the benefit  of the holders of shares of Legacy Common
Stock, for exchange in accordance  with this Article 3, certificates
representing the Merger Consideration and  cash in lieu of fractional shares
of the Merger Consideration to be issued  pursuant to Section 3.1 and paid
pursuant to this Section 3.2 in exchange  for outstanding shares of Legacy
Common Stock, and dividends and other  distributions on the Merger
Consideration contemplated by Section 3.2(c).   (b) Promptly after the
Effective Time, Enterprises shall cause the  Exchange Agent to mail to each
holder of record of a Certificate or  Certificates, (i) a letter of
transmittal which shall specify that delivery  shall be effected, and risk of
loss and title to the Certificates shall  pass, only upon delivery of the
Certificates to the Exchange Agent and  shall be in such form and have such
other provisions as Enterprises may  reasonably specify and (ii) instructions
for use in effecting the surrender  of the Certificates in exchange for
certificates representing the Merger  Consideration and cash in lieu of
fractional shares of the Merger  Consideration. Upon surrender of a
Certificate for cancellation to the  Exchange Agent together with such letter
of transmittal, duly executed and  completed in accordance with the
instructions thereto, the holder of such  Certificate shall be entitled to
receive in exchange therefor (x)  certificates representing the number of
whole shares of the Merger  Consideration and (y) a check representing the
amount of cash in lieu of  fractional shares of the Merger Consideration, if
any, and unpaid dividends  and distributions, if any, which such holder has
the right to receive in  respect of the Certificate surrendered pursuant to
the provisions of  Section 3.2(c), after giving effect to any required
withholding tax, and  the Certificate so surrendered shall forthwith be
cancelled. No interest  will be paid or accrued on the cash in lieu of
fractional shares of the  Merger Consideration and unpaid dividends and
distributions, if any,  payable to holders of Certificates. In the event of a
transfer of ownership  of Legacy Common Stock which is not registered in the
transfer records of  Legacy, certificates representing the proper number of
shares of the Merger  Consideration, together with a check for the cash to be
paid in lieu of  fractional shares of the Merger Consideration, may be issued
to such a  transferee if the Certificate representing shares of such Legacy
Common  Stock is presented to the Exchange Agent, accompanied by all
documents  required to evidence and effect such transfer and to evidence that
any  applicable stock transfer taxes have been paid.   (c) Notwithstanding
any other provisions of this Agreement, no  dividends or other distributions
on the Merger Consideration shall be paid  with respect to any shares of
Legacy Common Stock represented by a  Certificate until such Certificate is
surrendered for exchange as provided  herein. Subject to the effect of
applicable laws, following surrender of  any    5    such Certificate,
there shall be paid to the holder of the certificates  representing whole
shares of the Merger Consideration issued in exchange  therefor, without
interest (i) at the time of such surrender, the amount of  dividends or other
distributions with a record date after the Effective  Time theretofore
payable with respect to such whole shares of the Merger  Consideration and
not paid, less the amount of any withholding taxes which  may be required
thereon and (ii) at the appropriate payment date, the  amount of dividends or
other distributions with a record date after the  Effective Time but prior to
surrender and a payment date subsequent to  surrender payable with respect to
such whole shares of the Merger  Consideration, less the amount of any
withholding taxes which may be  required thereon.   (d) At and after the
Effective Time, there shall be no transfers on  the stock transfer books of
Legacy of the shares of Legacy Common Stock  which were outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time. If, after  the Effective Time,
Certificates are presented to Legacy, they shall be  cancelled and exchanged
for certificates for the Merger Consideration and  cash in lieu of fractional
shares of the Merger Consideration, if any, and  unpaid dividends and
distributions deliverable in respect thereof pursuant  to this Agreement in
accordance with the procedures set forth in this  Article 3.   (e) No
fractional shares of the Merger Consideration shall be issued  pursuant
hereto. In lieu of the issuance of any fractional shares of the  Merger
Consideration pursuant to Section 3.1(b), cash adjustments will be  paid to
holders in respect of any fractional shares of the Merger  Consideration that
would otherwise be issuable, and the amount of such cash  adjustment shall be
equal to such fractional proportion of the closing  sales prices of the
Enterprises Common Stock on the Nasdaq National Market  ("Nasdaq") as
reported in THE WALL STREET JOURNAL or, if not reported  thereby, by another
authoritative source, during the five (5) consecutive  trading days
immediately preceding the date on which the Effective Time  occurs.   (f)
Any portion of the Merger Consideration held by the Exchange Agent  (together
with any cash in lieu of fractional shares of the Merger  Consideration and
the proceeds of any investments thereof) that remains  unclaimed by the
former stockholders of Legacy one (1) year after the  Effective Time shall be
delivered to Enterprises. Any former stockholders  of Legacy who have not
theretofore complied with this Article 3 shall  thereafter look only to
Enterprises for payment of their shares  constituting the Merger
Consideration, cash in lieu of fractional shares of  the Merger Consideration
and unpaid dividends and distributions on the  Merger Consideration
deliverable in respect of each share of Legacy Common  Stock such stockholder
holds as determined pursuant to this Agreement, in  each case, without any
interest thereon.   (g) None of Enterprises, Merger Sub, the Surviving
Corporation, the  Exchange Agent or any other person shall be liable to any
former  stockholder of Legacy for any amount properly delivered to a public 
official pursuant to applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar 
laws.   (h) In the event any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or 
destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the person 
claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if required 
by Enterprises, the posting by such person of a bond in such reasonable  
6    amount as Enterprises may direct as indemnity against any claim that
may be  made against it with respect to such Certificate, the Exchange Agent
or  Enterprises will issue in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed 
Certificate a certificate representing the Merger Consideration and cash in 
lieu of fractional shares and unpaid dividends and distributions on shares 
of the Merger Consideration as provided in Section 3.2(d), deliverable in 
respect thereof pursuant to this Agreement.   (i) Pursuant to Section 262(b)
of the DGCL, the holders of shares of  Legacy Common Stock shall not be
entitled to appraisal rights as a result  of the Merger.   ARTICLE 4 
REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF LEGACY   Except as set forth in the
disclosure letter delivered at or prior to the execution hereof to
Enterprises (the "Legacy Disclosure Letter"), or as set forth in the Legacy
Reports (as hereinafter defined) filed prior to the date of this Agreement
(it being understood and agreed that disclosure set forth in the Legacy
Disclosure Letter and such Legacy Reports shall be applicable to each
particular representation and warranty of Legacy herein contained to the
extent it is reasonably evident on the face of such disclosure that such
disclosure applies to such representation and warranty), Legacy represents
and warrants to Enterprises as follows:   4.1 EXISTENCE; GOOD STANDING;
AUTHORITY; COMPLIANCE WITH LAW. Legacy is a corporation duly incorporated,
validly existing and in good standing under the laws of the State of
Delaware. Legacy is duly licensed or qualified to do business as a foreign
corporation and is in good standing under the laws of any other state of the
United States in which the character of the properties owned or leased by it
therein or in which the transaction of its business makes such qualification
necessary, except where the failure to be so qualified would not reasonably
be expected to have a material adverse effect on the business, assets,
results of operations or condition (financial or otherwise) of Legacy and its
Subsidiaries taken as a whole (a "Legacy Material Adverse Effect"). Legacy
has all requisite corporate power and authority to own, operate, lease and
encumber its properties and carry on its business as now being
conducted. Each of Legacy\'s Subsidiaries is a corporation, limited liability
company or partnership duly organized, validly existing and in good standing
under the laws of its jurisdiction of incorporation or organization, has the
corporate, company or partnership power and authority to own its properties
and to carry on its business as it is now being conducted, and is duly
qualified to do business and is in good standing in each jurisdiction in
which the ownership of its property or the conduct of its business requires
such qualification, except for jurisdictions in which such failure to be so
qualified or to be in good standing would not have a Legacy Material Adverse
Effect. Neither Legacy nor any of its Subsidiaries is in violation of any
order of any court, governmental authority or arbitration board or tribunal,
or any law, ordinance, governmental rule or regulation to which Legacy or any
of its Subsidiaries or any of their respective properties or assets is
subject, except where such violation would not have a Legacy Material Adverse
Effect. To the knowledge of Legacy, Legacy and its Subsidiaries have obtained
all licenses, permits and other authorizations and have taken all actions
required by applicable law or governmental regulations in connection with
their business as now conducted, except where the failure to obtain any such
item or to take any such action would not have a Legacy Material Adverse  
7   Effect. Copies of Legacy\'s and its Subsidiaries\' charter,
bylaws, organization documents and partnership and joint venture agreements
have been previously delivered or made available to Enterprises.   4.2

materially impair business operations conducted by Legacy and
its Subsidiaries and which have arisen or been incurred only in the ordinary
course of business. Valid policies of title insurance have been issued

use of the Legacy Properties, Legacy and its Subsidiaries have not failed to
comply with all applicable local, state and federal environmental laws,
regulations, ordinances and administrative and judicial orders relating to
the generation, recycling, reuse, sale, storage, handling, transport and

Section 4001 has contributed to, or been required to contribute to, any

provided. Except as disclosed in Schedule 4.14 of the Legacy Disclosure
Letter, the execution of, and performance of the transactions contemplated

collective bargaining unit presently being made or threatened involving
employees of Legacy or any of its Subsidiaries.   4.16 NO BROKERS. Legacy

Schedule 5.6 of the Enterprises Disclosure Letter, neither the execution and
delivery by Enterprises of this Agreement nor the consummation by Enterprises

(the "Enterprises Articles") or the bylaws of Enterprises (the "Enterprises
Bylaws"), (b) violate, or conflict with, or result in a breach of any

provisions of any note, bond, mortgage, indenture, deed of trust or any
license, franchise, permit, lease, contract, agreement or other instrument,
commitment or obligation to which Enterprises or any of its Subsidiaries is a
party, or by which Enterprises or any of its Subsidiaries or any of their
properties is bound or affected, except for any of the foregoing matters

required forms, reports and documents with the SEC since January 1, 2000
(collectively, the "Enterprises Reports"). As of their respective dates, the
Enterprises Reports (a) complied as to form in all material respects with the
Securities Laws and (b) did not contain any untrue statement of a material
fact or omit to state a material fact required to be stated therein or
necessary to make the statements made therein, in the light of the
circumstances under which they were made, not misleading. Each of the
consolidated balance sheets of Enterprises included in or incorporated by
reference into the Enterprises Reports (including the related notes and
schedules) fairly presents in all material respects the
consolidated financial position of Enterprises and its Subsidiaries as of its
date and each of the consolidated statements of income, retained earnings and
cash flows of Enterprises included in or incorporated by reference into the
Enterprises Reports (including any related notes and schedules) fairly
presents in all material respects the results of operations, retained
earnings or cash flows, as the case may be, of Enterprises and its
Subsidiaries for the periods set forth therein (subject, in the case of
unaudited statements, to normal, year-end audit adjustments which would not
be material in amount or effect), in each case in accordance with generally
accepted accounting principles consistently applied during the periods
involved, except as may be noted therein or in the notes thereto and except,
in the case of the unaudited statements, as permitted by Form 10-Q of the
Exchange Act.    5.8 LITIGATION. There are (a) no continuing orders,
injunctions or decrees of any court, arbitrator or governmental authority to
which Enterprises or any of its Subsidiaries is a party or by which any of
its properties or assets are bound or, to the knowledge of Enterprises, to
which any of its directors, officers, employees or agents is a party or by
which any of their properties or assets are bound and (b) no actions, suits
or proceedings pending against Enterprises or any of its Subsidiaries or, to
the knowledge of Enterprises, against any of its directors, officers,
employees or agents or, to the knowledge of Enterprises, threatened in
writing against Enterprises or any of its Subsidiaries or against any of its
directors, officers, employees or agents, at law or in equity, or before or
by any federal or state commission, board, bureau, agency or instrumentality,
that in the case of clauses (a) or (b) above, individually or in the
aggregate, would have an Enterprises Material Adverse Effect.   18   
5.9 ABSENCE OF CERTAIN CHANGES. Except as disclosed in the
Enterprises Reports filed with the SEC prior to the date hereof or in
Schedule 5.9 of the Enterprises Disclosure Letter, since September 30, 2000,
Enterprises and its Subsidiaries have conducted their business only in the
ordinary course of such business and there has not been (a) any Enterprises
Material Adverse Effect, (b) as of the date hereof, any declaration, setting
aside or payment of any dividend or other distribution with respect to the
Enterprises Common Stock or Enterprises Preferred Stock or (c) any material
change in Enterprises\' accounting principles, practices or methods.   5.10
TAXES.   (a) Enterprises and each of its Subsidiaries (i) has timely filed
all  Returns required to be filed by any of them for tax years ended prior
to  the date of this Agreement or requests for extensions have been timely 
filed and any such request has been granted and has not expired and all  such
Returns are complete in all material respects, (ii) has paid or  accrued all
Taxes shown to be due and payable on such Returns or which have  become due
and payable pursuant to any assessment, deficiency notice,  30-day letter or
other notice received by it and (iii) has properly accrued  all such Taxes
for such periods subsequent to the periods covered by such  Returns. The
Returns of Enterprises and each of its Subsidiaries have not  been examined
by the appropriate taxing authority, except for such  examinations that,
individually or in the aggregate, would not have an  Enterprises Material
Adverse Effect. Neither Enterprises nor any of its  Subsidiaries has executed
or filed with the IRS or any other taxing  authority any agreement now in
effect extending the period for assessment  or collection of any income or
other Taxes. Neither Enterprises nor any of  its Subsidiaries is a party to
any pending action or proceeding by any  governmental authority for
assessment or collection of Taxes, and no claim  for assessment or collection
of Taxes has been asserted against it. True,  correct and complete copies of
all Returns filed by Enterprises and each of  its Subsidiaries and all
communications relating thereto have been  delivered to Legacy or made
available to representatives of Legacy. The  most recent audited financial
statements contained in the Enterprises  Reports reflect an adequate reserve
for all material Taxes payable by  Enterprises and the Enterprises
Subsidiaries for all taxable periods and  portions thereof through the date
of such financial statements. Since the  date of such financial statements,
Enterprises has incurred no liability  for Taxes under Sections 857(b),
860(c) or 4981 of the Code, including  without limitation, any Tax arising
from a prohibited transaction described  in Section 857(b)(6) of the Code,
and neither Enterprises nor any  Enterprises Subsidiary has incurred any
liability for Taxes other than in  the ordinary course of business.   (b)
Enterprises (i) has elected for federal and state income tax  purposes to be
taxed as a "real estate investment trust" within the meaning  of the Code (a
"REIT") commencing with its short taxable year ended  December 31, 1997, (ii)
has been subject to taxation as a REIT for federal  and state income tax
purposes within the meaning of Section 856 of the Code  and has satisfied all
requirements to qualify as a REIT for federal and  state income tax purposes
for all taxable years commencing with its short  taxable year ended December
31, 1997 through its taxable year ended  December 31, 2000, (iii) has
operated since December 31, 2000 to the date  of this representation, and
intends to continue to operate in such a manner  so as to qualify as a REIT
for federal and state income tax purposes for  its taxable year ending on
December 31, 2001 and (iv) has not taken or  omitted to take any action which
would reasonably be expected to result in  a challenge to its status as a
REIT for federal or state income tax  purposes, and to the knowledge of  
19    Enterprises, no such challenge is pending or threatened.
Enterprises  represents that (i) for federal and state income tax purposes,
each of its  corporate Subsidiaries (including, without limitation, Merger
Sub) has at  all requisite times been, and continues to be, treated as a
"qualified REIT  subsidiary" as defined in Section 856(i) of the Code (as in
effect prior to  the enactment of the Taxpayer Relief Act of 1997) (a "QRS"),
and (ii) each  partnership, limited liability company, joint venture or other
legal entity  in which Enterprises (either directly or indirectly) owns any
of the  capital stock or other equity interests thereof has been treated
since its  formation and continues to be treated for federal income tax
purposes as a  partnership and not as an association or publicly traded
partnership  taxable as a corporation. Neither Enterprises nor any of its
Subsidiaries  holds any asset the disposition of which would be subject to
results  similar to Code Section 1374 as a result of an election under IRS
Notice  88-19 or Temporary Treasury Regulations Section 1.337(d)-5T. The
execution  and delivery of this Agreement and the consummation of the
transactions  contemplated hereby, or in compliance with or fulfillment of
the terms and  provisions hereof, by Enterprises will not adversely affect
the  qualification of Enterprises as a REIT for federal and state income
tax  purposes for each taxable year ending on or after the date of this 
Agreement.   5.11 BOOKS AND RECORDS.   (a) The books of account and other
financial records of Enterprises  and its Subsidiaries are in all material
respects true, complete and  correct, have been maintained in accordance with
good business practices,  and are accurately reflected in all material
respects in the financial  statements included in the Enterprises
Reports.   (b) The minute books and other records of Enterprises and its 
Subsidiaries have been made available to Legacy, contain in all material 
respects accurate records of all meetings and accurately reflect in all 
material respects all other action of the stockholders, members, partners 
and directors and any committees of the Board of Directors of Enterprises 
and its Subsidiaries.   5.12 PROPERTIES. Enterprises and its Subsidiaries
own fee simple title to, or hold ground leases in, each of the real
properties identified in Schedule 5.12 of the Enterprises Disclosure Letter
(the "Enterprises Properties"), which are all the real estate properties
owned or leased by them. The Enterprises Properties are not subject to any
Property Restrictions, except for (a) Encumbrances and Property Restrictions
set forth in Schedule 5.12 of the Enterprises Disclosure Letter, (b) Property
Restrictions imposed or promulgated by law or any governmental body or
authority with respect to real property, including zoning regulations,
provided such Property Restrictions do not adversely affect in any material
respect the current use of the applicable property, (c) Encumbrances and
Property Restrictions disclosed on existing title reports or current surveys
(in either case copies of which title reports and surveys have been delivered
or made available to Legacy) and (d) mechanics\', carriers\', workmen\'s,
repairmen\'s liens and other Encumbrances, Property Restrictions and other
limitations of any kind, if any, which, individually or in the aggregate, do
not materially detract from the value of or materially interfere with the
present use of any of the Enterprises Properties subject thereto or affected
thereby, and do not otherwise materially impair business operations conducted
by Enterprises and its Subsidiaries and which have arisen or been incurred
only in the ordinary course of business.   20   Valid policies of title
insurance have been issued insuring Enterprises\' or any of its
Subsidiaries\' fee simple title to the Enterprises Properties in amounts at
least equal to the purchase price thereof, subject only to the matters
set forth therein or disclosed above and in Schedule 5.12 of the
Enterprises Disclosure Letter, and such policies are, at the date hereof, in
full force and effect and there are no pending claims against any such
policy. Any material certificate, permit or license from any governmental
authority having jurisdiction over any of the Enterprises Properties and any
agreement, easement or other right which is necessary to permit the material
lawful use and operation of the buildings and improvements on any of the
Enterprises Properties or which is necessary to permit the lawful use and
operation of all driveways, roads and other means of egress and ingress,
which Enterprises has rights to, to and from any of the Enterprises
Properties which are currently occupied has been obtained and is in full
force and effect, and, to the knowledge of Enterprises, there exists no
pending threat of modification or cancellation of any of same. Enterprises is
not in receipt of any written notice of any violation of any material
federal, state or municipal law, ordinance, order, regulation or requirement
affecting any portion of any of the Enterprises Properties issued by any
governmental authority, other than such violations which would not have
an Enterprises Material Adverse Effect.   5.13 ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS. To
the knowledge of Enterprises, none of Enterprises, any of its Subsidiaries or
any other person has caused or permitted (a) the unlawful presence of any
Hazardous Materials on any of the Enterprises Properties or (b) any unlawful
spills, releases, discharges or disposal of Hazardous Materials to have
occurred or be presently occurring on or from the Enterprises Properties as a
result of any construction on or operation and use of such properties, which
presence or occurrence would, individually or in the aggregate, have an
Enterprises Material Adverse Effect; and in connection with the construction
on or operation and use of the Enterprises Properties, Enterprises and its
Subsidiaries have not failed to comply with all applicable local, state and
federal environmental laws, regulations, ordinances and administrative and
judicial orders relating to the generation, recycling, reuse, sale, storage,
handling, transport and disposal of any Hazardous Materials, except where the
failure to so comply would not have an Enterprises Material Adverse
Effect.   5.14 EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLANS. Schedule 5.14 of the Enterprises
Disclosure Letter lists each employee benefit fund, plan, program,
arrangement and contract (including, without limitation, any "pension" plan,
fund or program, as defined in Section 3(2) of ERISA, and any "employee
benefit plan," as defined in Section 3(3) of ERISA and any plan, program,
arrangement or contract providing for severance; medical, dental or vision
benefits; life insurance or death benefits; disability benefits, sick pay or
other wage replacement; vacation, holiday or sabbatical; pension or profit-
sharing benefits; stock options or other equity compensation; bonus or
incentive pay or other material fringe benefits), whether written or not,
maintained, sponsored or contributed to or required to be contributed to by
Enterprises or its Subsidiaries (the "Enterprises Benefit Plans"). True and
complete copies of the Enterprises Benefit Plans have been made available to
Legacy. To the extent applicable, the Enterprises Benefit Plans comply, in
all material respects, with the requirements of ERISA and the Code, and any
Enterprises Benefit Plan intended to be qualified under Section 401(a) of the
Code has been determined by the IRS to be so qualified. No Enterprises
Benefit Plan is or has been covered by Title IV of ERISA or Section 412 of
the Code. Neither any Enterprises Benefit Plan nor any fiduciary thereof nor
Enterprises has incurred any material liability or penalty under Section 4975
of the   21   Code or Section 502(i) of ERISA. Each Enterprises Benefit
Plan has been maintained and administered in all material respects in
compliance with its terms and with ERISA, the Code and all other laws to the
extent applicable thereto. There are no pending or, to the knowledge of
Enterprises, anticipated claims against or otherwise involving any of the
Enterprises Benefit Plans and no suit, action or other litigation (excluding
claims for benefits incurred in the ordinary course of Enterprises Benefit
Plan activities) has been brought against or with respect to any such
Enterprises Benefit Plan, except for any of the foregoing which would not
have a Enterprises Material Adverse Effect. All material contributions
required to be made as of the date hereof to the Enterprises Benefit Plans
have been timely made or provided for. Neither Enterprises nor any entity
under "common control" with Enterprises within the meaning of ERISA Section
4001 has contributed to, or been required to contribute to, any pension plan
which is or was subject to Title IV of ERISA. Enterprises does not maintain
or contribute to any plan, program, policy or arrangement which provides or
has any liability to provide life insurance, medical or other employee
welfare benefits or supplemental pension benefits to any employee or former
employee upon his retirement or termination of employment, except as required
under Section 4890B of the Code or any applicable state law, and Enterprises
has never represented, promised or contracted (whether in oral or written
form) to any employee or former employee that such benefits would
be provided. Except as disclosed in Schedule 5.14 of the Enterprises
Disclosure Letter, the execution of, and performance of the transactions
contemplated by, this Agreement will not (either alone or upon the occurrence
of any additional subsequent events) constitute an event under any benefit
plan, program, policy, arrangement or agreement or any trust or loan that
will or may result in any payment (whether of severance pay or otherwise),
acceleration, forgiveness of indebtedness, vesting, distribution, increase in
benefits or obligations to fund benefits with respect to any employee,
director or consultant of Enterprises or any of its Subsidiaries.   5.15
LABOR MATTERS. Neither Enterprises nor any of its Subsidiaries is a party to,
or bound by, any collective bargaining agreement, contract or other agreement
or understanding with a labor union or labor union organization. There is no
unfair labor practice or labor arbitration proceeding pending or, to
the knowledge of Enterprises, threatened against Enterprises or any of
its Subsidiaries relating to their business, except for any such proceeding
which would not have an Enterprises Material Adverse Effect. To the knowledge
of Enterprises, there are no organizational efforts with respect to the
formation of a collective bargaining unit presently being made or threatened
involving employees of Enterprises or any of its Subsidiaries.   5.16 NO
BROKERS. Enterprises has not entered into any contract, arrangement or
understanding with any person or firm which may result in the obligation
of Enterprises or Legacy to pay any finder\'s fees, brokerage or agent\'s
commissions or other like payments in connection with the negotiations
leading to this Agreement or the consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby, except that Enterprises has retained American Appraisal
Associates, Inc. ("Enterprises Financial Advisor") to render a fairness
opinion, pursuant to an engagement letter dated February 28, 2001, true and
correct copies of which have been delivered to Legacy prior to the date
hereof. Other than the foregoing arrangements, Enterprises has not taken any
action which would result in any claim for payment of any finder\'s fees,
brokerage or agent\'s commissions or other like payments in connection with
the negotiations leading to this Agreement or the consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby.   22    5.17 OPINION OF FINANCIAL
ADVISOR. Enterprises has received the opinion of Enterprises Financial

Persons on the other hand, that would be required to be disclosed under Item
404 of Regulation S-K under the Securities Act.   5.20 CONTRACTS AND
COMMITMENTS. Schedule 5.20 of the Enterprises Disclosure Letter or the
Enterprises Reports set forth, as of the date hereof, (a) all notes,

or collateralized by mortgages, deeds of trust or other security interests in
the Enterprises Properties or personal property of Enterprises and its

SOLICITATION BY LEGACY.   (a) Unless and until this Agreement shall have
been terminated in  accordance with its terms, Legacy shall not, and shall
cause its  Subsidiaries and its and their directors, officers, employees,
investment  bankers, financial advisors, attorneys, accountants and other 
representatives retained by it or any of its Subsidiaries not to, directly 
or indirectly through another person, (i) solicit, initiate or encourage 
(including by way of furnishing information), or take any other action 
designed to facilitate, any inquiries or the making of any proposal which 
constitutes or may reasonably be expected to lead to any Legacy Takeover 
Proposal (as hereinafter defined) or (ii) participate in any discussions or 
negotiations regarding or relating to any Legacy Takeover Proposal; 
provided, however, that prior to the Legacy Stockholders Meeting, if the 
Board of Directors of Legacy determines reasonably and in good faith that  it
is   25    necessary to do so in order to comply with its duties to the
stockholders  of Legacy under applicable law, Legacy may, in response to a
Legacy  Takeover Proposal which was not solicited by it and which did not
result  from a breach of this Section 6.1(a), provided Legacy shall provide
prior  written notice of its decision to take such action to Enterprises and
shall  comply with Section 6.1(c), (x) furnish information with respect to
Legacy  and its Subsidiaries to any person making such a Legacy Takeover
Proposal  pursuant to a customary confidentiality agreement (as determined by
Legacy  after consultation with its outside counsel) and (y) participate in 
discussions or negotiations regarding such Legacy Takeover Proposal. For 
purposes of this Agreement, "Legacy Takeover Proposal" means any proposal 
made by a third party (other than Enterprises) to acquire, directly or 
indirectly, including pursuant to a tender offer, exchange offer, merger, 
consolidation, business combination, recapitalization, reorganization, 
liquidation, dissolution or similar transaction, more than 25% of the 
combined voting power of the Legacy Common Stock or shares or equity 
interests in any of its Subsidiaries, in each case then outstanding, or all 
or substantially all the assets of Legacy or any of its Subsidiaries. 
Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing in this Section 6.1 shall prevent 
Legacy from consummating the $100,000,000 investment contemplated in  Section
6.12(e).   (b) Except as expressly permitted by this Section 6.1 neither
the  Board of Directors of Legacy nor any committee thereof shall (i)
withdraw  or propose publicly to withdraw, or modify or propose to modify in
a manner  adverse to Enterprises, the approval or recommendation by such
Board of  Directors or such committee of the Legacy Voting Proposals, (ii)
approve or  recommend, or propose publicly to approve or recommend, any
Legacy Takeover  Proposal or (iii) cause Legacy to enter into any letter of
intent,  agreement in principle, acquisition agreement or other similar
agreement  (each, a "Legacy Acquisition Agreement") related to any Legacy
Takeover  Proposal. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event that a
majority of  the Board of Directors of Legacy determines reasonably and in
good faith  (A) (based on the advice of a financial advisor of nationally
recognized  reputation) that a pending Legacy Takeover Proposal is more
favorable to  Legacy\'s stockholders than the Merger and the transactions
contemplated  hereby, (B) that such Legacy Takeover Proposal is reasonably
capable of  being consummated, (C) that there is a substantial probability
that the  Legacy Voting Proposals will not be approved by holders of Legacy
Common  Stock due to the pending Legacy Takeover Proposal and (D) (taking
into  account the matters in clause (A), (B) and (C) above) that it is
necessary  to terminate this Agreement to accept such Legacy Takeover
Proposal in  order to comply with its duties to the stockholders of Legacy
under  applicable law in the context of the transactions contemplated hereby,
the  Board of Directors of Legacy may (subject to this and the following 
sentences and in compliance with Section 8.3(a)) approve and recommend such 
Legacy Takeover Proposal and, in connection therewith, withdraw its  approval
or recommendation of the Legacy Voting Proposals, provided that in  such case
it simultaneously therewith terminates this Agreement and  concurrently with
such termination causes Legacy to enter into a definitive  acquisition
agreement with respect to such Legacy Takeover Proposal, but  only at a time
that is after the fifth business day following Enterprises\'  receipt of
written notice advising Enterprises that the Board of Directors  of Legacy is
prepared to accept a Legacy Takeover Proposal, specifying the  material terms
and conditions of such Legacy Takeover Proposal and  identifying the person
making such Legacy Takeover Proposal, provided that  (y) at all reasonable
times during such five-day period Legacy shall have  cooperated with
Enterprises with the objective of   26    providing Enterprises a
reasonable opportunity to propose and negotiate a  modification of the terms
and conditions of this Agreement so that a  business combination may be
effected between Enterprises and Legacy and (z)  at the end of such five-day
period the Board of Directors shall continue to  believe in good faith that
clauses (A), (B), (C) and (D) above apply to the  Legacy Takeover
Proposal.   (c) In addition to the obligations of Legacy set forth in
paragraphs  (a) and (b) of this Section 6.1, Legacy shall immediately cease
any current  discussions and negotiations with respect to any Legacy Takeover
Proposal  and hereafter immediately advise Enterprises orally and in writing
of any  request for information or of any Legacy Takeover Proposal, the
material  terms and conditions of such request or Legacy Takeover Proposal
and the  identity of the person making such request or Legacy Takeover
Proposal.  Legacy will keep Enterprises reasonably informed of the status and
details  (including amendments or proposed amendments) of any such request or
Legacy  Takeover Proposal.   (d) Nothing contained in this Section 6.1
shall prohibit Legacy from  taking and disclosing to its stockholders a
position contemplated by Rule  14d-9 and Rule 14e-2(a) promulgated under the
Exchange Act or from making  any disclosure to Legacy\'s stockholders if, in
the good faith judgment of  the Board of Directors of Legacy, after
consultation with outside counsel,  failure so to disclose would be a
violation of its obligations under  applicable law; provided, however, that
neither Legacy nor its Board of  Directors nor any committee thereof shall
withdraw or modify, or propose  publicly to withdraw or modify, its position
with respect to the Legacy  Voting Proposals or approve or recommend, or
propose publicly to approve or  recommend, a Legacy Takeover Proposal, except
in accordance with this  Section 6.1.   6.2 NO SOLICITATION BY
ENTERPRISES.   (a) Unless and until this Agreement shall have been
terminated in  accordance with its terms, Enterprises shall not, and shall
cause its  Subsidiaries and its and their directors, officers, employees,
investment  bankers, financial advisors, attorneys, accountants and other 
representatives retained by it or any of its Subsidiaries not to, directly 
or indirectly through another person, (i) solicit, initiate or encourage 
(including by way of furnishing information), or take any other action 
designed to facilitate, any inquiries or the making of any proposal which 
constitutes or may reasonably be expected to lead to any Enterprises 
Takeover Proposal (as hereinafter defined) or (ii) participate in any 
discussions or negotiations regarding or relating to any Enterprises 
Takeover Proposal; provided, however, that prior to the Enterprises 
Stockholders Meeting, if the Board of Directors of Enterprises determines 
reasonably and in good faith that it is necessary to do so in order to 
comply with its duties to the stockholders of Enterprises under applicable 
law in the context of the transactions contemplated hereby, Enterprises  may,
in response to an Enterprises Takeover Proposal which was not  solicited by
it and which did not result from a breach of this Section  6.2(a), and
provided Enterprises shall provide prior written notice of its  decision to
take such action to Legacy and shall comply with Section  6.2(c), (x) furnish
information with respect to Enterprises and its  Subsidiaries to any person
making such an Enterprises Takeover Proposal  pursuant to a customary
confidentiality agreement (as determined by  Enterprises after consultation
with its outside counsel) and (y)  participate in discussions or negotiations
regarding such Enterprises  Takeover Proposal. For purposes of this
Agreement,   27    "Enterprises Takeover Proposal" means any proposal
made by a third party  (other than Legacy) to acquire, directly or
indirectly, including pursuant  to a tender offer, exchange offer, merger,
consolidation, business  combination, recapitalization, reorganization,
liquidation, dissolution or  similar transaction, more than 25% of the
combined voting power of the  shares of Enterprises Common Stock or shares or
equity interests in any of  its Subsidiaries, in each case then outstanding
or all or substantially all  the assets of Enterprises or any of its
Subsidiaries. Notwithstanding the  foregoing, nothing in this Section 6.2
shall prevent Enterprises from  consummating the $100,000,000 investment
contemplated in Section 6.12(e).   (b) Except as expressly permitted by this
Section 6.2, neither the  Board of Directors of Enterprises nor any committee
thereof shall (i)  withdraw or propose publicly to withdraw, or modify or
propose publicly to  modify in a manner adverse to Legacy, the approval or
recommendation by  such Board of Directors or such committee of the
Enterprises Voting  Proposals in connection with the Merger, (ii) approve or
recommend, or  propose publicly to approve or recommend, any Enterprises
Takeover Proposal  or (iii) cause Enterprises to enter into any letter of
intent, agreement in  principle, acquisition agreement or other similar
agreement (each, an  "Enterprises Acquisition Agreement") related to any
Enterprises Takeover  Proposal. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event
that a majority of  the Board of Directors of Enterprises determines
reasonably and in good  faith (A) (based on the advice of a financial advisor
of nationally  recognized reputation) that a pending Enterprises Takeover
Proposal is more  favorable to Enterprises\' stockholders than the Merger and
the transactions  contemplated hereby, (B) that such Enterprises Takeover
Proposal is  reasonably capable of being consummated, (C) that there is a
substantial  probability that the Enterprises Voting Proposals will not be
approved by  holders of Enterprises Common Stock due to the pending
Enterprises Takeover  Proposal and (D) (taking into account the matters in
clause (A), (B) and  (C)) that it is necessary to terminate this Agreement to
accept such  Enterprises Takeover Proposal in order to comply with its duties
to the  stockholders of Enterprises under applicable law in the context of
the  transactions contemplated hereby, the Board of Directors of Enterprises
may  (subject to this and the following sentences and in compliance with
Section  8.4(a)) approve and recommend such Enterprises Takeover Proposal
and, in  connection therewith, withdraw its approval or recommendation of
the  Enterprises Voting Proposals, provided that in such case it
simultaneously  therewith terminates this Agreement and concurrently with
such termination  causes Enterprises to enter into a definitive acquisition
agreement with  respect to such Enterprises Takeover Proposal, but only at a
time that is  after the fifth business day following Legacy\'s receipt of
written notice  advising Legacy that the Board of Directors of Enterprises is
prepared to  accept an Enterprises Takeover Proposal, specifying the material
terms and  conditions of such Enterprises Takeover Proposal and identifying
the person  making such Enterprises Takeover Proposal, provided that (y) at
all  reasonable times during such five-day period Enterprises shall have 
cooperated with Legacy with the objective of providing Legacy a reasonable 
opportunity to propose and negotiate a modification of the terms and 
conditions of this Agreement so that a business combination may be effected 
between Enterprises and Legacy and (z) at the end of such five-day period 
the Board of Directors of Enterprises shall continue to believe in good 
faith that clauses (A), (B), (C) and (D) above apply to the Enterprises 
Takeover Proposal.   28    (c) In addition to the obligations of
Enterprises set forth in  paragraphs (a) and (b) of this Section 6.2,
Enterprises shall immediately  cease any current discussions or negotiations
with respect to any  Enterprises Takeover Proposal and hereafter, immediately
advise Legacy  orally and in writing of any request for information or of any
Enterprises  Takeover Proposal, the material terms and conditions of such
request or  Enterprises Takeover Proposal and the identity of the person
making such  request or Enterprises Takeover Proposal. Enterprises will keep
Legacy  reasonably informed of the status and details (including amendments
or  proposed amendments) of any such request or Enterprises Takeover
Proposal.   (d) Nothing contained in this Section 6.2 shall prohibit
Enterprises  from taking and disclosing to its stockholders a position
contemplated by  Rule 14d-9 and Rule 14e-2(a) promulgated under the Exchange
Act or from  making any disclosure to Enterprises\' stockholders if, in the
good faith  judgment of the Board of Directors of Enterprises, after
consultation with  outside counsel, failure so to disclose would be a
violation of its  obligations under applicable law; provided, however, that
neither  Enterprises nor its Board of Directors nor any committee thereof
shall  withdraw or modify, or propose publicly to withdraw or modify, its
position  with respect to the Enterprises Voting Proposals or approve or
recommend,  or propose publicly to approve or recommend, an Enterprises
Takeover  Proposal, except in accordance with this Section 6.2.   6.3

upon, in the case of Legacy (including any adjournment or postponement
thereof, the "Legacy Stockholders Meeting") the approval of this Agreement
and the Merger (collectively, the "Legacy Voting Proposals"), and, in the
case of Enterprises (including any adjournment or postponement thereof, the
"Enterprises Stockholders Meeting") the approval of the issuance of the
Merger Consideration, the adoption of an equity incentive plan in a form
mutually agreeable to the parties (the "Enterprises Option Plan"), the
amendments to the Enterprises Articles set forth on EXHIBIT C to this
Agreement (the "Enterprises Charter Amendment") and the election of

reasonable action to solicit such approvals, including, without limitation,
timely mailing the Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus (as hereinafter defined).
Enterprises and Legacy shall coordinate and cooperate with respect to the

Legacy established pursuant to this paragraph, either Enterprises or Legacy
has respectively received less than the requisite approval and neither a
Legacy Takeover Proposal nor an Enterprises Takeover Proposal has been

both parties shall recommend the adjournment or postponement of their
respective meetings until the first to occur of (a) the date ten (10) days
after the originally scheduled date of such meetings or (b) the date on which
duly executed proxies for the requisite number of votes approving the Legacy
Voting Proposals (in the case of Legacy) or the date on which duly executed
proxies for the requisite number of votes approving the Enterprises Voting
Proposals (in the case of Enterprises) shall have been obtained.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, Legacy and Enterprises and their respective
Boards of Directors may take and disclose to their respective stockholders a
position contemplated by Rule 14e-2 promulgated under the Exchange Act if
required to do so by the Exchange Act, comply with Rule 14d-9 thereunder and
make all other disclosures required by applicable law.   6.5 FILINGS; OTHER
ACTION. Subject to the terms and conditions herein provided, Legacy,
Enterprises and Merger Sub shall (a) to the extent required, promptly make
their respective filings with respect to the Merger, (b) use all reasonable
efforts to cooperate with one another in (i) determining which filings are
required to be made prior to the Effective Time with, and which consents,
approvals, permits or authorizations are required to be obtained prior to the
Effective Time from, governmental or regulatory authorities of the
United States, the several states and foreign jurisdictions in connection
with the execution and delivery of this Agreement and the consummation of
the transactions contemplated hereby and (ii) timely making all such filings
and timely seeking all such consents, approvals, permits or authorizations,
(c) use all reasonable efforts to obtain in writing any consents required
from third parties in form reasonably satisfactory to Legacy and Enterprises
necessary to effectuate the Merger and (d) use all reasonable efforts to
take, or cause to be taken, all other action and do, or cause to be done, all
other things necessary, proper or appropriate to consummate and make
effective the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. If, at any time
after the Effective Time, any further action is necessary or desirable to
carry out the purpose of this Agreement, the proper officers and directors of
Legacy, Enterprises and Merger Sub shall take all such necessary action. If
any "fair   35   price" or "control share acquisition" statute or similar
statute or regulation shall become applicable to the transactions
contemplated hereby, Legacy, Enterprises and Merger Sub and their respective
Boards of Directors shall use commercially reasonable efforts to grant such
approvals and to take such other actions as are necessary so that the
transactions contemplated hereby may be consummated as promptly as
practicable on the terms contemplated hereby and shall otherwise use
commercially reasonable efforts to minimize or eliminate the effects of any
such statute or regulation on the transactions contemplated hereby.
Enterprises and Legacy shall promptly advise each other of and confer and
consult with respect to any communications from governmental agencies
with respect to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.   6.6
INSPECTION OF RECORDS. Until the earlier of the Effective Time or the date on
which this Agreement is terminated in accordance with its terms, each
of Legacy and Enterprises shall allow all designated officers,
attorneys, accountants and other representatives of the other access at all
reasonable times to the records and files, correspondence, audits and
properties, as well as to all information relating to commitments, contracts,
titles and financial position, or otherwise pertaining to the business and
affairs, of Legacy and Enterprises and their respective Subsidiaries for
purposes related to an evaluation of the transactions contemplated hereby,
subject to any restrictions arising under applicable law.   6.7 PUBLICITY.
The initial press release relating to this Agreement shall be a joint press
release and thereafter Legacy and Enterprises shall, subject to their
respective legal obligations (including requirements of stock exchanges and
other similar regulatory bodies), consult with each other, and use reasonable
efforts to agree upon the text of any press release, before issuing any such
press release or otherwise making public statements with respect to
the transactions contemplated hereby and in making any filings with any
federal or state governmental or regulatory agency or with any national
securities exchange with respect thereto.   6.8 REGISTRATION STATEMENT.
Enterprises and Legacy shall cooperate and promptly prepare and Enterprises
shall file with the SEC as soon as reasonably practicable, a Registration
Statement on Form S-4 (the "Form S-4") under the Securities Act, with respect
to the Merger Consideration issuable in the Merger, and a portion of which
Registration Statement shall also serve as the joint proxy statement with
respect to the Legacy Stockholders Meeting and the Enterprises Stockholders
Meeting (the "Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus"). The respective parties will
cause the Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus and the Form S-4 to comply as to
form in all material respects with the applicable provisions of the
Securities Act, the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations thereunder.
Each of Legacy and Enterprises shall furnish all information about itself and
its business and operations and all necessary financial information to the
other as the other may reasonably request in connection with the preparation
of the Form S-4. Enterprises shall use its reasonable best efforts, and
Legacy will cooperate with Enterprises, to have the Form S-4
declared effective by the SEC as promptly as practicable. Enterprises shall
use its reasonable best efforts to obtain, prior to the effective date of the
Form S-4, all necessary state securities law or "Blue Sky" permits or
approvals required to carry out the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement and will pay all expenses incident thereto. Enterprises agrees that
the Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus and each amendment or supplement thereto
at the time of mailing thereof and at the time of the Legacy Stockholders
Meeting and Enterprises Stockholders Meeting, respectively, and, in the case
of the Form S-4 and each amendment or   36   supplement thereto, at the
time it is filed or becomes effective, will not include an untrue statement
of a material fact or omit to state a material fact required to be stated
therein or necessary to make the statements therein, in light of the
circumstances under which they were made, not misleading; provided, however,
that the foregoing shall not apply to the extent that any such
untrue statement of a material fact or omission to state a material fact was
made by Enterprises in reliance upon and in conformity with information

issuable in the Merger (unless the Board of Directors of Enterprises
determines to submit such an application to an alternative national
securities exchange, which is reasonably acceptable to Legacy), and shall use

the listing of such Enterprises Common Stock, subject to official notice of
issuance.   6.10 EXPENSES. Each of Enterprises, Merger Sub, and Legacy will

the transactions contemplated hereby.   6.11 INDEMNIFICATION.   (a) In
the event of any threatened or actual claim, action, suit,  proceeding or
investigation, whether civil, criminal or administrative,  including, without
limitation, any such claim, action, suit, proceeding or  investigation in
which any person who is now, or has been at any time prior  to the date
hereof, or who becomes prior to the Effective Time, a director,  officer,
employee, fiduciary or agent of Legacy (each an "Indemnified  Party") is, or
is threatened to be, made a party based in whole or in part  on, or arising
in whole or in part out of, or pertaining to (i) the fact  that he, she or it
is or was a director, officer, employee or agent of  Legacy, or is or was
serving at the request of Legacy as a director,  officer, employee or agent
of another corporation, partnership, joint  venture, limited liability
company or other enterprise or (ii) this  Agreement or any of the
transactions contemplated hereby, whether in any  case asserted or arising
before or after the Effective Time (and including  with respect to any
matters occurring at the Effective   37    Time), the parties hereto
agree to cooperate and use commercially  reasonable efforts to defend against
and respond thereto. It is understood  and agreed that Legacy shall indemnify
and hold harmless, and after the  Effective Time Enterprises shall indemnify
and hold harmless, as and to the  full extent permitted by applicable law or
the Legacy Certificate, each  Indemnified Party against any losses, claims,
damages, liabilities, costs,  expenses (including reasonable attorneys\' fees
and expenses), judgments,  fines and amounts paid in settlement in connection
with any such threatened  or actual claim, action, suit, proceeding or
investigation, and in the  event of any such threatened or actual claim,
action, suit, proceeding or  investigation (whether asserted or arising
before or after the Effective  Time (and including with respect to any
matters occurring at the Effective  Time)), (i) Legacy, and Enterprises after
the Effective Time, shall  promptly pay expenses in advance of the final
disposition of any claim,  suit, proceeding or investigation to each
Indemnified Party to the full  extent permitted by law, (ii) the Indemnified
Parties may retain counsel  satisfactory to them, provided such counsel is
reasonably satisfactory to  Legacy, and Enterprises after the Effective Time,
(iii) Legacy, and  Enterprises after the Effective Time, shall promptly pay
all fees and  expenses of such counsel for the Indemnified Parties after
reasonably  detailed statements therefor are received and (iv) Legacy and
Enterprises  will use commercially reasonable efforts to assist in the
vigorous defense  of any such matter; provided, that neither Legacy nor
Enterprises shall be  liable for any settlement effected without its prior
written consent (which  consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or
delayed); and provided  further that Enterprises shall have no obligation
hereunder to any  Indemnified Party when and if a court of competent
jurisdiction shall  ultimately determine, and such determination shall have
become final and  non-appealable, that indemnification of such Indemnified
Party in the  manner contemplated hereby is prohibited by applicable law. The
Indemnified  Parties as a group may retain only one law firm to represent
them with  respect to any single action unless there is, under applicable
standards of  professional conduct, a conflict on any significant issue
between the  positions of any two or more Indemnified Parties. Any
Indemnified Party  wishing to claim indemnification under this Section 6.11,
upon learning of  any such claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation,
shall notify  Legacy and, after the Effective Time, Enterprises, thereof,
provided that  the failure to so notify shall not affect the obligations of
Legacy or  Enterprises except to the extent such failure to notify
materially  prejudices such party.   (b) Enterprises agrees that all rights
to indemnification existing in  favor, and all limitations on the personal
liability, of the Indemnified  Parties provided for in the Legacy Certificate
or similar organizational  documents as in effect as of the Effective Time
with respect to matters  occurring at or prior to the Effective Time are
contract rights and shall  survive the Merger and shall continue in full
force and effect thereafter.   (c) From and after the Effective Time,
Enterprises shall, or shall  cause the Surviving Corporation to, keep in
effect provisions in the Legacy  Certificate that provide for exculpation of
director liability and  indemnification of directors, officers, employees and
agents of Legacy to  the extent that such persons are entitled thereto under
the Legacy  Certificate on the date hereof (or, if more favorable to such
persons, at  the Effective Time as contemplated by Article 1 hereof), which
provisions  shall not be amended, repealed or otherwise modified for a period
of six  years after the Effective Time in any manner that would adversely
affect  the rights thereunder of any such individuals unless such
modification is  required by law.   38    (d) In the event that
Enterprises or the Surviving Corporation or any  of their successors or
assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any  other person and shall not
be the continuing or surviving corporation or  entity of such consolidation
or merger or (ii) transfers all or  substantially all of its properties and
assets to any person, then, and in  each such case the successors and assigns
of such entity shall assume the  obligations set forth in this Section 6.11,
which obligations are expressly  intended to be for the irrevocable benefit
of, and shall be enforceable by,  each Indemnified Party.   (e) This
Section 6.11 is intended to be for the benefit of, and to  grant third party
rights to, the Indemnified Parties, their heirs and  personal representatives
and shall be binding on Enterprises and the  Surviving Corporation, and their
representatives, successors and assigns.  Each of the Indemnified Parties
shall be entitled to enforce the covenants  contained in this Section 6.11
and Enterprises acknowledges and agrees that  each Indemnified Party would
suffer irreparable harm in the event of and  that no adequate remedy at law
exists for a breach of such covenants.   6.12 EMPLOYEES; OFFICERS;
DIRECTORS.   (a) Enterprises shall offer positions of employment to all
employees  of Legacy immediately following the Effective Time and shall
assume all  employment agreements of Legacy, subject to the modifications
contemplated  by Section 7.3(c) hereof. The positions offered to such
employees shall be  reasonably comparable to the positions held by such
individuals at Legacy,  and the level of salary and bonus for any individual
will not be less than  his or her salary as of the date hereof and his or her
bonus for calendar  year 2000, respectively. Enterprises shall establish
fringe benefits for  all such individuals which are consistent in the
aggregate with the fringe  benefits currently enjoyed by such individuals as
a group at Legacy.   (b) Subject to considerations relating to the
particular geographic  region in which the employee is located and applicable
law, it is the  intent of the parties hereto that the employees of Legacy
employed by  Enterprises after the Effective Time (the "Former Legacy
Employees") shall  in general receive credit with respect to each employee
benefit plan,  program, policy or arrangement of Enterprises, for service
with Legacy or  any of its Subsidiaries (as applicable) for purposes of
determining  eligibility to participate (including waiting periods, and
without being  subject to any entry date requirement after the waiting period
has been  satisfied), vesting (as applicable) and entitlement to benefits. 
Enterprises shall provide each Former Legacy Employee with credit for any 
co-payments and deductibles paid prior to the Effective Time in satisfying 
any applicable deductible or out-of-pocket requirements under any welfare 
plans that such employees are eligible to participate in after the  Effective
Time, to the extent legally permissible.   (c) For purposes of this Section
6.12, the term "employees" shall mean  all current employees of Legacy and
its Subsidiaries (including those on  disability or approved leave of
absence, paid or unpaid).   (d) The persons listed on EXHIBIT D hereto under
the heading  "Officers" with their respective titles shall be the officers
of  Enterprises as of the Effective Time. In the event   39    that
prior to the Effective Time any person designated on EXHIBIT D  (including by
reason of this sentence) is unable or unwilling to serve as  an officer of
Enterprises, Enterprises and Legacy shall mutually determine  the person or
persons to serve as such officer in replacement for such  person.   (e) As
of the Effective Time, the Board of Directors of Enterprises  shall be
reconstituted to have seven (7) members, four (4) to be designated  by
Enterprises and three (3) to be designated by Legacy (subject to the  right
of the investor, or group of investors, making any investment of at  least
$100,000,000, to designate one (1) additional director and one (1) of  the
three (3) directors to otherwise be designated by Legacy), so that the 
persons listed on EXHIBIT D hereto under the heading "Directors" shall 
become the directors of Enterprises as of the Effective Time. In the event 
that any person designated on EXHIBIT D is unable or unwilling to serve as  a
director of Enterprises as of the Effective Time, then Enterprises shall 
designate the replacements for any such persons who are designated by 
Enterprises, and Legacy shall designate the replacements for any such 
persons who are designated by Legacy and in each such case, such  replacement
designees shall be treated as if set forth on EXHIBIT D as of  the date
hereof in place of the person for whom he or she has been  designated as a
replacement.   (f) After the Effective Time, Enterprises shall make periodic
grants  of options with respect to its Common Stock to the Former Legacy
Employees  on a basis which is generally comparable to Legacy\'s stock option
grant  practices prior to the Effective Time and which is consistent with 
Enterprises stock option grant practices for its employees who are situated 
similarly to the Former Legacy Employees. In addition, in making such 
grants, Enterprises agrees that it shall take into account any Legacy stock 
options which the Former Legacy Employees have agreed to cancel prior to  the
Effective Time.   6.13 REORGANIZATION. Neither Legacy, Enterprises or Merger
Sub or any of their respective Subsidiaries or other Affiliates shall take
any action or fail to take any action if such action or failure to act would
jeopardize qualification of the Merger as a reorganization within the meaning
of Section 368(a) of the Code. Legacy, Enterprises and Merger Sub shall take
all actions which are necessary to obtain the opinions of counsel referred to
in Section 7.1(f), including, without limitation, by making any and all
representations and covenants reasonably requested by counsel to render such
opinions.   6.14 ADVICE OF CHANGES. Enterprises and Legacy shall each
promptly advise the other party orally and in writing to the extent it has
knowledge of any change or event having, or which, insofar as can reasonably
be foreseen, would have a Legacy Material Adverse Effect or Enterprises
Material Adverse Effect, as the case may be, or a material adverse effect on
the ability of the conditions set forth in Article 7 to be satisfied;
provided, however, that no such notification shall affect the
representations, warranties, covenants or agreements of the parties (or
remedies with respect thereto) or the conditions to the obligations of the
parties under this Agreement.   6.15 REIT STATUS. Notwithstanding anything
to the contrary set forth in this Agreement, nothing in this Agreement shall
prohibit Enterprises from taking, and Enterprises hereby agrees to take, any
action at any time or from time to time that in the reasonable judgment  
40   of the Board of Directors of Enterprises, upon advice of counsel, is
legally necessary or desirable for Enterprises to maintain its qualification
as a REIT for federal and state income tax purposes or to eliminate or
reduce income or excise taxes under Sections 856-860 and 4981 of the Code
(and similar provisions of state or local tax law) for any period or
portion thereof ending on or prior to the Effective Time, including
without limitation, making dividend or distribution payments to stockholders
of Enterprises.   6.16 CONFIDENTIALITY. Each of Legacy and Enterprises
shall, and shall cause its advisers and agents to, maintain the
confidentiality of all confidential information furnished to it by the other
party concerning it and its Subsidiaries\' businesses, operations and
financial positions and shall not use such information for any purpose except
in furtherance of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. If this
Agreement is terminated prior to the Closing Date, each party shall promptly
return or certify the destruction of all documents and copies thereof, and
all work papers containing confidential information received from the other
party.   6.17 TENDER OFFER. Prior to the Effective Time, Enterprises shall
take all action necessary in accordance with applicable law and the
Enterprises Articles, as applicable, to commence an offer (the "Tender
Offer") to purchase all outstanding shares of Enterprises Common Stock (other
than those shares held by Legacy) at a price of $7.00 per share, net to the
seller in cash without interest. The Tender Offer shall close concurrently
with, and be conditioned on, the consummation of the Merger. Enterprises
shall be obligated to accept for payment, purchase and pay for all shares of
Enterprises Common Stock tendered pursuant to the Tender Offer which are
validly tendered and not withdrawn prior to the expiration of the Tender
Offer.   6.18 EXCHANGE OFFER/CONSENT SOLICITATION. Prior to the Effective
Time, Enterprises shall take all action necessary in accordance with
applicable law and the Enterprises Articles, as applicable, to commence an
exchange offer (the "Exchange Offer") in which holders of the Debentures and
the Notes would be offered Enterprises Preferred Stock in exchange for their
debt securities. The Debentures and the Notes will be valued at par and the
Enterprises Preferred Stock will be valued at $15.00 per share for purposes
of the Exchange Offer. The Exchange Offer shall close concurrently with, and
be conditioned on the consummation of the Merger. In connection with the
Exchange Offer, Enterprises shall also seek the consent of the holders of a
majority of the outstanding principal amount of the Debentures and the Notes
to (a) release the collateral securing such debt securities and (b) take any
other related actions requiring their consent. Enterprises shall be obligated
to acquire, and to issue shares of Enterprises Preferred Stock in exchange
for, all Debentures and Notes tendered pursuant to the Exchange Offer which
are validly tendered and not withdrawn prior to the expiration of the
Exchange Offer. Upon receipt of the requisite vote of the holders of the
Debentures and the Notes, Enterprises shall take all action necessary to
cause the Enterprises Common Stock held by the Surviving Corporation securing
the Debentures and the Notes to be cancelled for no consideration.   6.19
LEGACY ASSET TRANSFER AND TRS ELECTION. Prior to the Effective Time, Legacy
shall form a wholly owned Subsidiary having the directors and officers set
forth on EXHIBIT A and EXHIBIT B hereto, respectively, and shall transfer
to such Subsidiary all of the assets listed on EXHIBIT E hereto in a
manner mutually agreeable to the parties (the "Legacy Asset Transfer").  
41   After the Closing Date, Enterprises shall, to the extent permitted
under applicable law, make a timely and valid election to treat such
Subsidiary as its "taxable REIT subsidiary" within the meaning of Code
Section 856(l) (a "TRS") for federal and state income tax purposes, with such
election to be effective from and after the Effective Time.   6.20 MERGER
SUB. Enterprises shall cause Merger Sub to take all necessary action to
complete the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, subject to the
terms and conditions hereof.   6.21 PRESERVATION OF REIT STATUS. At all
times from and after the date of this Agreement, (a) Enterprises shall take
all actions necessary for Enterprises to maintain its status as a REIT for
federal and state income tax purposes and (b) Enterprises shall not take any
action or fail to take any action if such action or failure to act could
cause Enterprises to fail to qualify as a REIT for federal or state income
tax purposes.   6.22 REORGANIZATION. Each party hereto shall use its
reasonable best efforts to cause the Merger to qualify, and will not
knowingly take any actions or cause any actions to be taken which could
reasonably be expected to prevent the Merger from qualifying, as a
reorganization within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code. Each party
hereto shall report the Merger as a reorganization within the meaning of Code
Section 368(a)(1)(C) and shall take no position inconsistent therewith on any
Return or in any audit or other proceeding before any taxing authority.  
6.23 ELECTION WITH RESPECT TO ASSETS. After the Effective Time,
Enterprises shall make a valid, timely and irrevocable election pursuant to
IRS Notice 88-19 and Temporary Treasury Regulations Section 1.337(d)-5T(b)
with respect to the assets of Legacy and its Subsidiaries acquired by
Enterprises in the Merger.   42    6.24 TRANSFER AND GAINS TAX.
Enterprises will pay any federal, state, local or foreign tax which is
attributable to the transfer of the beneficial ownership of Legacy\'s or its
Subsidiaries\' real and personal property (collectively, the "Gains Taxes"),
any penalties or interest with respect to the Gains Taxes payable in
connection with the consummation of the Merger, any federal, state, local or
foreign tax which is attributable to the transfer of Legacy Common Stock
pursuant to the terms of this Agreement (collectively, "Stock
Transfer Taxes") and any penalties or interest with respect to any such Stock
Transfer Taxes. Legacy and Enterprises agree to cooperate with the other in
the filing of any Returns with respect to the Gains Taxes or Stock Transfer
Taxes, including supplying in a timely manner a complete list of all real
property interests held by Legacy and its Subsidiaries and any information
with respect to such property that is reasonably necessary to complete such
Returns. The portion of the consideration allocable to the real property of
Legacy and its Subsidiaries shall be agreed to between Enterprises and
Legacy. The stockholders of Legacy shall be deemed to have agreed to be bound
by the allocation established pursuant to this Section 6.24 in the
preparation of any Return with respect to the Gains Taxes or Stock Transfer
Taxes. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Gains Taxes and Stock Transfer
Taxes shall not include any federal, state, local or foreign tax in the
nature of an income tax.   ARTICLE 7  CONDITIONS   7.1 CONDITIONS TO EACH

reasonable efforts to have any  such order, ruling or injunction lifted,

the Effective Time.   (f) Enterprises and Merger Sub shall have received an
opinion dated  the Closing Date of Munger, Tolles and Olson LLP and Legacy

Code. In  rendering their opinions such firms may rely on representations of
Legacy,  Enterprises, Merger Sub and others.   (g) There shall not have
been (i) any federal legislative or  regulatory change that would cause
Enterprises to cease to qualify (either  prior to the Merger or after the
Effective Time) as a REIT for federal or  state income tax purposes or (ii)
any federal legislative or regulatory  change that would cause the Merger to

representation or warranty is  expressly limited by its terms to another
date), and Legacy shall have  received a certificate of the Chairman or Chief
