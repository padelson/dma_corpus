resources expended and opportunities foregone while negotiating this Agreement and in reliance on this Agreement and on the expectation of the consummation of the Transactions. In addition, if the Company fails to pay in a timely manner any amount
due pursuant to Section&nbsp;9.2(b), then (i)&nbsp;the Company shall reimburse Parent for all costs and expenses (including disbursements and fees of counsel) incurred in the collection of such overdue amount, including in connection with any
related claims, actions or proceedings commenced and (ii)&nbsp;the Company shall pay to Parent interest on the amounts payable pursuant to Section&nbsp;9.2(b) from and including the date payment of such amount or amounts were due to but excluding
the date of actual payment at the prime rate set forth in The Wall Street Journal in effect on the date such payment was required to be made. Other than for Willful Breach, payment of the Termination Fee (and any additional amounts required under
this Section&nbsp;9.2(d)) to Parent by the Company in accordance with this Agreement shall be the sole and exclusive remedy of Parent and shall be deemed to be liquidated damages for any actual or purported breach of this Agreement and for any and
all losses or damages suffered or incurred by Parent or any of its Affiliates in connection with this Agreement (and the termination hereof), the transactions contemplated hereby (and the abandonment thereof) or any matter forming the basis for such
termination and, after such payment has been made, the Company and its Affiliates shall have no further liability for any such actual or purported breach or for any and all losses or damages suffered or incurred by Parent or any of its Affiliates in
connection with this Agreement (and the termination hereof), the transactions contemplated hereby (and the abandonment thereof) or any matter forming the basis for such termination. </P>

<P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B>Bases for Opinion </B></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The opinion set forth in this letter
is based on relevant current provisions of the U.S. Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the &#147;<B>Code</B>&#148;), the Treasury Regulations promulgated thereunder (including proposed and temporary Treasury Regulations), and interpretations
of the foregoing as expressed in court decisions, applicable legislative history, and the administrative rulings and practices of the U.S. Internal Revenue Service (the &#147;<B>IRS</B>&#148;), including its practices and policies in issuing private
letter rulings, which are not binding on the IRS except with respect to a taxpayer that receives such a ruling, all as of the date hereof. These provisions and interpretations are subject to change by the IRS, Congress and the courts (as
applicable), which may or may not be retroactive in effect and which might result in material modifications of our opinion. Our opinion does not foreclose the possibility of a contrary determination by the IRS or a court of competent jurisdiction,
or of a contrary position taken by the IRS or the United States Treasury Department in regulations or rulings issued in the future. In this regard, an opinion of counsel with respect to an issue represents counsel&#146;s best professional judgment
with respect to the outcome on the merits with respect to such issue, if such issue were to be litigated, but an opinion is not binding on the IRS or the courts, and is not a guarantee that the IRS will not assert a contrary position with respect to
such issue or that a court will not sustain such a position asserted by the IRS. </P>

qualifications set forth herein, including, without limitation, the discussion in the next three paragraphs below, we are of the opinion that, commencing with the Company&#146;s taxable year that ended on December&nbsp;31, 2011 and through and
including the taxable year that ends on the Effective Time, the Company has been organized and has operated in conformity with the requirements for qualification and taxation as a REIT under the Code. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The Company&#146;s qualification and taxation as a REIT under the Code depends upon the ability of the Company to meet on an ongoing basis (through actual
quarterly and annual operating results, distribution levels, diversity of share ownership and otherwise) the various qualification tests imposed under the Code, and upon the Company and/or Parent utilizing any and all appropriate &#147;savings
provisions&#148; (including the provisions of Sections 856(c)(6), 856(c)(7), and 856(g) of the Code and the provision included in Section&nbsp;856(c)(4) of the Code (flush language) allowing for the disposal of assets within 30 days after the close
of a calendar quarter, and all available deficiency dividend procedures) available to the Company and/or Parent under the Code to correct violations of specified REIT qualification requirements of Sections 856 and 857 of the Code. Our opinion set
forth above does not foreclose the possibility that the Company and/or Parent may have to utilize one or more of these &#147;savings provisions&#148; in the future, which could require the Company and/or Parent to pay an excise or penalty tax (which
could be significant in amount) in order to maintain the Company&#146;s REIT qualification. We have not undertaken to review the Company&#146;s and Parent&#146;s compliance with these requirements on a continuing basis. Accordingly, no assurance can
be given that the actual results of the Company&#146;s operations, the sources of its income, the nature of its assets, the level of its distributions to shareholders and the diversity of its share ownership for any given taxable year will satisfy
the requirements under the Code for qualification and taxation as a REIT. </P>
