ARTICLE I

THE OFFER 

1.1 The Offer.

 

(a) Terms and Conditions of the Offer. Subject to the terms and conditions of
this Agreement and provided that this Agreement shall not have been
terminated pursuant to Article IX and that the Company shall have complied
with its obligations under this Section 1.1 and Section 1.2, as promptly as
practicable after the date hereof (but in no event more than ten (10)
business days thereafter), Purchaser shall (and Parent shall cause Purchaser
to) commence (within the meaning of Rule 14d-2 promulgated under the Exchange
Act) the Offer. In the Offer, each Company Share accepted by Purchaser in
accordance with the terms and subject to the conditions of the Offer shall be
exchanged for the right to receive, at the election of the holder: (i) $19.65
in cash (the " _Cash Consideration_ "), (ii) 1.9037 shares of Parent Common
Stock (the " _Stock Consideration_ "), or (iii) $9.82 in cash and 0.9519
shares of Parent Common Stock (the " _Mixed Consideration_ ") (each of the
Cash Consideration, Stock Consideration and Mixed Consideration, as
applicable, the " _Offer Consideration_ "), in each case subject to proration
as set forth in Section 1.1(c) and the other provisions of this Article I. The
Offer shall be made by means of an offer to purchase (the " _Offer to
Purchase_ ") that is disseminated to all of the holders of Company Shares as
and to the extent required by the Exchange Act. The Offer to Purchase will
contain the terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement and in Annex B.
Each of Parent and Purchaser shall use its reasonable best efforts to
consummate the Offer, subject to the terms and conditions hereof and thereof.
The Offer shall be subject only to:

 

(i) the condition that, prior to the expiration of the Offer, there being
validly tendered (excluding Company Shares tendered pursuant to guaranteed
delivery procedures

 



2  that have not yet been "received" by the depositary for the Offer) and not
validly withdrawn in accordance with the terms of the Offer a number of
Company Shares that, together with the Company Shares then owned by Parent
and Purchaser (if any), represents at least a majority of all then-outstanding
Company Shares (the " _Minimum Condition_ "); and

 

(ii) the other conditions set forth in Annex B.

 

(b) Purchaser expressly reserves the right to waive or modify any of the
conditions to the Offer and to make any change in the terms of, or conditions
to, the Offer; _provided, however,_ that notwithstanding the foregoing or
anything to the contrary set forth herein, without the prior written consent
of the Company, in its sole discretion, Purchaser may not (and Parent shall
not permit Purchaser to) (i) waive any of the conditions set forth in clauses
(A), (B), (C), (D), (E)(5)(ii), (E)(6)(i), (G)(1), (G)(2) or (G)(3) of Annex B
(provided that Parent shall (and shall cause Purchaser to) waive any of the
conditions set forth in clauses (E)(5)(ii), (E)(6)(i), (G)(1), (G)(2) or
(G)(3) of Annex B upon the written request of the Company), or (ii) make any
change in the terms of or conditions to the Offer that (A) changes the form of
consideration to be paid in the Offer, (B) decreases the amount of
consideration in the Offer or the number of Company Shares sought in the Offer
(unless an appropriate adjustment is made pursuant to Section 1.1(d)), (C)
extends the Offer, other than in a manner required or permitted by the
provisions of Section 1.1(e), (D) imposes conditions to the Offer other than
those set forth in Annex B, or (E) amends or modifies any other term of, or
condition to, the Offer in any manner that is adverse or would reasonably be
expected to be adverse to the holders of Company Shares in their capacities as
such.

(c) Elections; Proration; Fractional Shares.

(i) Subject to the other provisions of this Section 1.1(c), each holder of
Company Shares validly tendered in the Offer shall be entitled to elect (1)
the number of Company Shares which such holder desires to exchange for the
right to receive the Mixed Consideration (a " _Mixed Election,_ " and such
shares, the " _Mixed Election Shares_ "), (2) the number of Company Shares
which such holder desires to exchange for the right to receive the Cash
Consideration (a " _Cash Election,_ " and such shares, the " _Cash Election
Shares_ "), and (3) the number of Company Shares which such holder desires to
exchange for the right to receive the Stock Consideration (a " _Stock
Election,_ " and such shares, the " _Stock Election Shares_ "). Any Cash
Election, Stock Election or Mixed Election shall be referred to herein as an "
_Election,_ " and shall be made on a form for that purpose prepared by Parent
that is reasonably acceptable to the Company (a " _Form of Election in Offer_
"), included as part of the letter(s) of election and transmittal accompanying
the Offer. Holders of record of Company Shares who hold such Company Shares
as nominees, trustees or in other representative capacities may submit
multiple Forms of Election in Offer on behalf of their respective beneficial
holders.

 

(ii) Any Election pursuant to the Offer shall have been properly made only if
the depositary for the Offer shall have actually received a properly
completed Form of Election in Offer by the expiration date of the Offer. Any
Form of Election in Offer may be revoked or changed by the authorized Person
properly submitting such Form of Election in Offer, by written
notice received by the depositary for the Offer prior to the expiration date
of the Offer. In the event an Election is revoked prior to the expiration date
of the Offer, the Company Shares represented by such Form of Election in Offer
shall become Mixed Election Shares (to the extent such Company Shares remain
tendered in the Offer and are not validly withdrawn from the Offer), except to
the extent a subsequent election is properly made with respect to any or all
of such Company Shares 

 



3  prior to the expiration date of the Offer. Subject to the terms of this
Agreement and of the Form of Election in Offer, the depositary for the Offer
shall have reasonable discretion to determine whether any election,
revocation or change has been properly or timely made and to disregard
immaterial defects in any Form of Election in Offer, and any good-faith
decisions of the depositary for the Offer regarding such matters shall be
binding and conclusive. None of Parent, Purchaser, the Company or the
depositary for the Offer shall be under any obligation to notify any Person of
any defect in a Form of Election in Offer.

 

(iii) Notwithstanding any other provision contained in this Agreement, the
Cash Elections and the Stock Elections shall be subject to proration as
described in this Section 1.1(c).

(1) The maximum number of Company Shares validly tendered and not
validly withdrawn in the Offer which shall be eligible to receive the Cash
Consideration shall equal 50% of the aggregate number of Company Shares
tendered in the Offer (and not validly withdrawn) (excluding Mixed Election
Shares and No Election Shares) (the " _Maximum Cash Shares in Offer_ ").

(2) If the total number of Cash Election Shares validly tendered and not
validly withdrawn in the Offer exceeds the Maximum Cash Shares in Offer, such
Cash Elections shall be subject to proration as follows: for each such Cash
Election, the number of Company Shares that shall be exchanged for the right
to receive the Cash Consideration shall be (A) the total number of Cash
Election Shares validly tendered and not validly withdrawn in the Offer
multiplied by (B) the Offer Cash Proration Factor, rounded down to the nearest
Company Share. The " _Offer Cash Proration Factor_ " means a fraction (x) the
numerator of which shall be the Maximum Cash Shares in Offer and (y) the
denominator of which shall be the total number of Cash Election Shares validly
tendered and not withdrawn in the Offer. The Cash Election Shares validly
tendered and not validly withdrawn in the Offer that are not exchanged for the
right to receive the Cash Consideration in accordance with this Section
1.1(c)(iii)(2) shall instead be exchanged for the right to receive the Stock
Consideration.

(3) The maximum number of Company Shares validly tendered and not validly
withdrawn in the Offer which shall be eligible to receive the Stock
Consideration shall equal 50% of the aggregate number of Company Shares
tendered in the Offer (and not validly withdrawn) (excluding Mixed Election
Shares and No Election Shares) (the " _Maximum Stock Shares in Offer_ ").

(4) If the total number of Stock Election Shares validly tendered and not
validly withdrawn in the Offer exceeds the Maximum Stock Shares in Offer, such
Stock Elections shall be subject to proration as follows: for each such Stock
Election, the number of Company Shares that shall be exchanged for the right
to receive the Stock Consideration shall be (A) the total number of Stock
Election Shares validly tendered and not validly withdrawn in the Offer
multiplied by (B) the Offer Stock Proration Factor, rounded down to the
nearest Company Share. The " _Offer Stock Proration Factor_ " means a
fraction (x) the numerator of which shall be the Maximum Stock Shares in Offer
and (y) the denominator of which shall be the total number of Stock Election
Shares validly tendered and not withdrawn in the Offer. The Stock Election
Shares validly tendered and not validly withdrawn in the Offer that are not
exchanged for the right to receive the Stock Consideration in accordance with
this Section 1.1(c)(iii)(4) shall instead be exchanged for the right to
receive the Cash Consideration.

 



4 (iv) All prorations resulting from either Section 1.1(c)(iii)(2) or Section
1.1(c)(iii)(4) shall be applied on a pro rata basis, such that each holder of
Company Shares who validly tenders Cash Election Shares or Stock Election
Shares, as applicable, bears its proportionate share of the proration, based
on a percentage of the total Cash Election Shares or Stock Election Shares,
as applicable, validly tendered in the Offer (and not validly withdrawn) by
such holder of Company Shares bears to all Cash Election Shares or Stock
Election Shares, as applicable, validly tendered in the Offer (and not
validly withdrawn) by all holders of Company Shares.

(v) Each Company Share validly tendered into the Offer (and not validly
withdrawn) but which is not the subject of a valid Election (a " _No Election
Share_ ") received prior to the expiration of the Offer shall be deemed to be
a Mixed Election Share. In no event shall any Mixed Election Shares or No
Election Shares be subject to proration pursuant to Section 1.1(c)(iii)(2) or
Section 1.1(c)(iii)(4).

 

(vi) In lieu of any fractional share of Parent Common Stock that otherwise
would be issuable pursuant to the Offer, each holder of Company Shares who
otherwise would be entitled to receive a fraction of a share of Parent Common
Stock pursuant to the Offer (after aggregating all Company Shares validly
tendered in the Offer (and not validly withdrawn) by such holder) will be
paid an amount in cash (without interest) equal to such fractional part of a
share of Parent Common Stock multiplied by the Parent Trading Price, rounded
to the nearest cent.

 

(d) Adjustments to the Offer. The Mixed Consideration, the Cash Consideration,
the Stock Consideration, the Maximum Cash Shares in Offer, the Offer Cash
Proration Factor, the Maximum Stock Shares in Offer and the Offer Stock
Proration Factor shall be adjusted appropriately, without duplication, to
reflect the effect of any stock split, reverse stock split, stock
dividend (including any dividend or other distribution of securities
convertible into Company Common Stock or Parent Common Stock, as applicable),
reorganization, recapitalization, reclassification, combination, exchange of
shares or other like change with respect to the number of Company Shares or
shares of Parent Common Stock outstanding after the date hereof and prior to
Purchasers acceptance for payment of, and payment for, Company Shares that
are validly tendered pursuant to the Offer. Nothing in this Section 1.1(d)
shall be construed to permit the Company or Parent to take any action with
respect to its securities that is prohibited by the terms of this Agreement.

 

(e) Expiration and Extension of the Offer.

 

(i) Unless the Offer is extended pursuant to and in accordance with this
Agreement, the Offer shall expire at 5:00 p.m., Eastern Time, on the twenty-
third (23rd) business day (for this purpose calculated in accordance with
Section 14d-1(g)(3) promulgated under the Exchange Act) after the date the
Offer is first commenced (within the meaning of Rule 14d-2 promulgated under
the Exchange Act). In the event that the Offer is extended pursuant to and in
accordance with this Agreement, then the Offer shall expire on the date and at
the time to which the Offer has been so extended.

 



5 (ii) Notwithstanding the provisions of Section 1.1(e)(i) or anything to the
contrary set forth in this Agreement:

(A) Purchaser shall (and Parent shall cause Purchaser to) extend the Offer for
any period required by any Law, or any rule, regulation, interpretation or
position of the SEC or its staff or of the NYSE or NASDAQ, in any such case,
which is applicable to the Offer or the Merger, or to the extent necessary to
resolve any comments of the SEC or its staff applicable to the Offer or the
Offer Documents or the Form S-4;

(B) in the event that any of the conditions to the Offer (other than the
Minimum Condition) have not been satisfied or waived as of any then-scheduled
expiration of the Offer, Purchaser shall (and Parent shall cause Purchaser to)
extend the Offer for one or more consecutive increments of not more than
ten (10) business days each (or for such longer period as may be agreed by
the Company) in order to permit the satisfaction of such conditions to the
Offer (other than the Minimum Condition);

 

(C) if as of any then-scheduled expiration of the Offer each condition to the
Offer (other than the Minimum Condition and those conditions that by their
nature are to be satisfied by action to be taken at the relevant expiration
date of the Offer) shall have been satisfied or waived and the Minimum
Condition shall not have been satisfied, Purchaser may, and, at the
written request of the Company, Purchaser shall (and Parent shall cause
Purchaser to), extend the Offer for one or more consecutive increments of ten
(10) business days each (or for such shorter or longer period as may be agreed
by the Company);  _provided_ , that in no event shall Purchaser be required
to extend the expiration date of the Offer more than two times pursuant to
this clause (C); and

 

(D) Purchaser may extend the Offer for any period necessary to satisfy the
notice requirements contained in Section 3-106.1(e)(1) of the MGCL (the "
_Maryland Short Form Merger Notice_ ");

_provided, however,_ that (1) any such extension shall not be deemed to
impair, limit, or otherwise restrict in any manner the right of the Parties to
terminate this Agreement pursuant to the terms of Article IX (subject, in the
case of Section 9.1(h), to Purchasers rights and obligations to extend the
Offer pursuant to this Section 1.1(e)(ii)), and (2) Purchaser shall not be
required to extend the Offer beyond the Outside Date.

the Company.

 

(iv) Neither Parent nor Purchaser shall terminate or withdraw the Offer prior
to the then-scheduled expiration of the Offer unless this Agreement is
validly terminated in accordance with Article IX, in which case Purchaser
shall (and Parent shall cause Purchaser to) irrevocably and unconditionally
terminate the Offer promptly (but in no event more than one (1) business day)
after such termination of this Agreement.

(f) Payment for Company Shares. On the terms of and subject to the conditions
set forth in this Agreement and the Offer, Purchaser shall (and Parent shall
cause Purchaser to) accept for payment, and pay for, all Company Shares that
are validly tendered and not validly withdrawn pursuant to the Offer promptly
(within the meaning of Section 14e-1(c) promulgated under the Exchange Act)
after the expiration of the Offer (as it may be extended in accordance with
Section

 



6  1.1(e)(ii)) (or, at Parents election, concurrently with the expiration of
the Offer if all conditions to the Offer have been satisfied or waived) (such
time of acceptance, the " _Acceptance Time_ "). Without limiting the
generality of the foregoing, Parent shall provide or cause to be provided to
Purchaser on a timely basis the funds and shares of Parent Common Stock
necessary to pay for any Company Shares that Purchaser becomes obligated to
purchase pursuant to the Offer; _provided, however,_ that without the prior
written consent of the Company, Purchaser shall not accept for payment, or pay
for, any Company Shares if, as a result, Purchaser would acquire less than
the number of Company Shares necessary to satisfy the Minimum Condition. The
consideration in the Offer payable in respect of each Company Share validly
tendered and not validly withdrawn pursuant to the Offer shall be paid net to
the holder thereof in cash or shares of Parent Common Stock, as applicable,
without interest and subject to reduction for any applicable withholding Taxes
payable in respect thereof. The Company shall register (and shall use

(a) Treatment of Company Common Stock. At the Effective Time, by virtue of the
Merger and without any action on the part of the Parties or holders of any
securities of the Company or of Purchaser, subject to any applicable
withholding Tax, each Company Share issued and outstanding immediately prior
to the Effective Time (other than any Cancelled Shares) shall be
automatically converted into the right to receive, without interest, at the
election of the holder: (i) the Cash Consideration, (ii) the Stock
Consideration, or (iii) the Mixed Consideration (in each case, the " _Common
Merger Consideration_ "), in each case subject to proration as set forth in
Section 3.1(e) and the other provisions of this Article III. From and after
the Effective Time, all such Company Shares shall no longer be outstanding and
shall automatically be cancelled and shall cease to exist, and each
applicable holder of such Company Shares shall cease to have any rights with
respect thereto, except the right to receive the applicable portion of Common
Merger Consideration therefor upon the surrender of such Company Shares in
accordance with Section 3.2, including the right to

 



12  receive, pursuant to Section 3.6, cash in lieu of fractional shares of
Parent Common Stock, if any, into which such Company Shares have been
converted pursuant to this Section 3.1(a) (the " _Fractional Share
Consideration_ "), together with the amounts, if any, payable pursuant to
Section 3.2(f).

 

(b) Treatment of Certain Company Common Stock. At the Effective Time, each
Company Share issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time
that is owned by Parent or Purchaser (including Company Shares accepted for
payment by Purchaser pursuant to the Offer) shall be cancelled and shall cease
to exist, and no consideration shall be delivered in exchange
therefor (collectively, the " _Cancelled Shares_ ").

(c) Treatment of Purchaser Shares. At the Effective Time, each issued and
outstanding share of common stock, par value $0.001 per share, of Purchaser
issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall remain
outstanding as shares of common stock of the Surviving Corporation.

 

(d) Treatment of Company Preferred Stock. At the Effective Time, by virtue of
the Merger and without any action on the part of the Parties or holders of
any securities of the Company or of Purchaser, subject to any applicable
withholding Tax, each share of the Companys 8.125% Series A Cumulative
Redeemable Preferred Stock, $0.01 par value per share (the " _Company
Preferred Stock_ " or such shares, the " _Company Preferred Shares_ ") issued
and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be automatically
converted into the right to receive one newly issued share of Parent Series H
Preferred Stock (the " _Preferred Merger Consideration_ "), subject to the
provisions of this Article III. From and after the Effective Time, all such
Company Preferred Shares shall no longer be outstanding and shall
automatically be cancelled and shall cease to exist, and each applicable
holder of such Company Preferred Shares shall cease to have any rights with
respect thereto, except the right to receive the Preferred
Merger Consideration therefor upon the surrender of such Company Preferred
Shares in accordance with Section 3.2.

(e) Elections; Proration.

(i) Subject to the other provisions of this Section 3.1(e), each holder of
Company Shares as of immediately prior to the consummation of the Merger
(other than Cancelled Shares) shall be entitled to elect (1) a number of Cash
Election Shares, (2) a number of Stock Election Shares, and (3) a number of
Mixed Election Shares. Any Cash Election, Stock Election or Mixed Election
shall be made on a form for that purpose prepared by Parent that is reasonably
acceptable to the Company (a " _Form of Election in Merger_ "), which shall be
mailed to such holders of Company Shares promptly after the Closing Date
(such date, the " _Mailing Date_ "). The deadline for submitting an effective,
properly completed Form of Election in Merger to the Exchange Agent shall be
5:00 p.m., Eastern Time, on the 20th day following the Mailing Date (or such
other time and date as the Parties may mutually agree) (the " _Election
Deadline_ "). Holders of record of Company Shares who hold such Company Shares
as nominees, trustees or in other representative capacities may submit
multiple Forms of Election in Merger on behalf of their respective beneficial
holders.

 

(ii) Any election shall have been properly made only if the Exchange Agent
shall have actually received a properly completed Form of Election in Merger
by the Election Deadline. Any Form of Election in Merger may be revoked or
changed by the authorized Person

 



13  properly submitting such Form of Election in Merger, by written notice
received by the Exchange Agent prior to the Election Deadline. In the event a
Form of Election in Merger is revoked prior to the Election Deadline, the
Company Shares represented by such Form of Election in Merger shall become
Mixed Election Shares, except to the extent a subsequent election is properly
made with respect to any or all of such Company Shares prior to the Election
Deadline. Subject to the terms of this Agreement and of the Form of Election
in Merger, the Exchange Agent shall have reasonable discretion to determine
whether any election, revocation or change has been properly or timely made
and to disregard immaterial defects in any Form of Election in Merger, and
any good-faith decisions of the Exchange Agent regarding such matters shall be
binding and conclusive. None of Parent, Purchaser, the Company or the Exchange
Agent shall be under any obligation to notify any Person of any defect in a
Form of Election in Merger.

(iii) Notwithstanding any other provision contained in this Agreement, the
Cash Election Shares and Stock Election Shares eligible to receive Common
Merger Consideration pursuant to Section 3.1(a) shall be subject to proration
as described in this Section 3.1(e).

 

(1) The maximum number of Company Shares which shall be eligible to receive
the Cash Consideration pursuant to Section 3.1(a) shall equal 50% of the
aggregate number of Company Shares entitled to receive Common Merger
Consideration pursuant to Section 3.1(a) (excluding Mixed Election Shares and
No Election Shares) (the " _Maximum Cash Shares in Merger_ ").

(2) If the total number of Cash Election Shares eligible to receive Common
Merger Consideration pursuant to Section 3.1(a) exceeds the Maximum Cash
Shares in Merger, such Cash Elections shall be subject to proration as
follows: for each such Cash Election, the number of Company Shares that shall
be converted into the right to receive the Cash Consideration shall be (A)
the total number of Cash Election Shares eligible to receive Common Merger
Consideration pursuant to Section 3.1(a) multiplied by (B) the Merger Cash
Proration Factor, rounded down to the nearest Company Share. The " _Merger
Cash Proration Factor_ " means a fraction (x) the numerator of which shall be
the Maximum Cash Shares in Merger and (y) the denominator of which shall be
the aggregate number of Cash Election Shares eligible to receive Common
Merger Consideration pursuant to Section 3.1(a). The Cash Election Shares that
were not converted into the right to receive the Cash Consideration in
accordance with this Section 3.1(e)(iii)(2) shall be converted into the right
to receive the Stock Consideration.

(3) The maximum number of Company Shares which shall be eligible to
receive the Stock Consideration pursuant to Section 3.1(a) shall equal 50% of
the aggregate number of Company Shares entitled to receive Common Merger
Consideration pursuant to Section 3.1(a) (excluding Mixed Election Shares and
No Election Shares) (the " _Maximum Stock Shares in Merger_ ").

(4) If the total number of Stock Election Shares eligible to receive Common
Merger Consideration pursuant to Section 3.1(a) exceeds the Maximum Stock
Shares in Merger, such Stock Elections shall be subject to proration as
follows: For each such Stock Election, the number of Company Shares that
shall be converted into the right to receive the Stock Consideration shall be
(A) the total number of Stock Election Shares eligible to receive Common
Merger Consideration pursuant to Section 3.1(a) multiplied by (B) the Merger
Stock Proration Factor, rounded down to the nearest Company Share. The "
_Merger Stock Proration Factor_ " means a fraction (x) the numerator of which
shall be the Maximum Stock Shares in Merger and (y) the 

 



14  denominator of which shall be the aggregate number of Stock Election Shares
eligible to receive Common Merger Consideration pursuant to Section 3.1(a).
The Stock Election Shares that were not converted into the right to receive
the Stock Consideration in accordance with this Section 3.1(e)(iii)(4) shall
be converted into the right to receive the Cash Consideration.

 

(iv) All prorations resulting from either Section 3.1(c)(iii)(2) or Section
3.1(c)(iii)(4) shall be applied on a pro rata basis, such that each holder of
Company Shares eligible to receive Common Merger Consideration pursuant to
Section 3.1(a) bears its proportionate share of the proration, based on a
percentage of the total Cash Election Shares or Stock Election Shares, as
applicable, elected by such holder of Company Shares bears to all Cash
Election Shares or Stock Election Shares, as applicable, elected by holders of
Company Shares in the Merger.

 

(v) Each Company Share eligible to receive the Common Merger Consideration
pursuant to Section 3.1(a) for which an election shall not have been properly
made by the Election Deadline shall be deemed to be a Mixed Election Share and
shall only be entitled to the right to receive the Mixed Consideration in
accordance with Section 3.1(a). In no event shall any Mixed Election Shares
be subject to proration pursuant to Section 3.1(e)(iii)(2) or Section
3.1(e)(iii)(4).

(f) Adjustment to Merger Consideration. The Merger Consideration, Maximum
Cash Shares in Merger, Merger Cash Proration Factor and Merger Stock Proration
Factor shall be adjusted appropriately, without duplication, to reflect the
effect of any stock split, reverse stock split, stock dividend (including any
dividend or other distribution of securities convertible into Company Common
Stock, Company Preferred Stock or Parent Common Stock, as applicable),
reorganization, recapitalization, reclassification, combination, exchange of
shares or other like change with respect to the number of Company Shares,
Company Preferred Shares or shares of Parent Common Stock outstanding after
the date hereof and prior to the Effective Time. Nothing in this Section
3.1(f) shall be construed to permit the Company or Parent to take any action
with respect to its securities that is prohibited by the terms of this
Agreement. For the avoidance of doubt, for Tax purposes, no adjustment shall
be made to the Merger Consideration, Maximum Cash Shares in Merger, Merger
Cash Proration Factor or Merger Stock Proration Factor to reflect the effect
of any cash distribution permitted to be made by the Company under this
Agreement prior to the Effective Time, including any cash dividend paid
pursuant to Section 6.4(a).

3.2 Payment for Securities; Surrender of Certificates.

 

(a) Exchange Fund. Prior to the Effective Time, Parent or Purchaser shall
designate a bank or trust company reasonably acceptable to the Company to act
as the exchange agent in connection with the Merger (the " _Exchange Agent_
"). The Exchange Agent shall also act as the agent for the holders of Company
Shares and Company Preferred Shares for the purpose of receiving and holding
their Certificates and Book-Entry Shares and shall obtain no rights or
interests in the shares represented thereby. At or immediately after the
Effective Time, Parent or Purchaser shall deposit, or cause to be deposited,
with the Exchange Agent (i) evidence of Parent Common Stock and Parent Series
H Preferred Stock issuable pursuant to Section 3.1(a) and Section 3.1(d),
respectively, in book-entry form equal to the aggregate Parent Common Stock
portion of the Common Merger Consideration (excluding any Fractional Share
Consideration) and the aggregate Preferred Merger
Consideration, respectively, and (ii) cash in immediately available funds in
an amount sufficient to pay the aggregate cash portion of the Merger
Consideration, Fractional Share Consideration and any dividends under Section
3.2(f) (such evidence of book-entry shares of Parent

 



15  Common Stock and Parent Series H Preferred Stock and cash amounts, together
with any dividends or other distributions with respect thereto, the "
_Exchange Fund_ "), in each case, for the sole benefit of the holders of
Company Shares and Company Preferred Shares. In the event the Exchange Fund
shall be insufficient (other than as a result of payment of the Merger
Consideration in accordance with this Agreement) to pay the aggregate cash
portion of the Merger Consideration, Fractional Share Consideration and any
dividends under Section 3.2(f), Parent shall, or shall cause the Surviving
Corporation to, promptly deposit, or cause to be deposited, additional funds
with the Exchange Agent in an amount which is equal to the shortfall that is
required to make such payment. Parent shall cause the Exchange Agent to make,
and the Exchange Agent shall make, delivery of the Merger Consideration,
including payment of the Fractional Share Consideration, and any amounts
payable in respect of dividends or other distributions on shares of Parent
Common Stock in accordance with Section 3.2(f) out of the Exchange Fund in
accordance with this Agreement. The Exchange Fund shall not be used for any
purpose that is not expressly provided for in this Agreement. The cash portion
of the Exchange Fund shall be invested by the Exchange Agent as reasonably
directed by Parent; _provided, however,_ that any investment of such cash
shall in all events be limited to direct short-term obligations of, or short-
term obligations fully guaranteed as to principal and interest by, the U.S.
government, in commercial paper rated P-1 or A-1 or better by Moodys
Investors Service, Inc. or Standard and Poors Corporation, respectively, or in
certificates of deposit, bank repurchase agreements or bankers acceptances
of commercial banks with capital exceeding $10 billion (based on the most
recent financial statements of such bank that are then publicly available),
and that no such investment or loss thereon shall affect the amounts payable
to holders of Certificates or Book-Entry Shares pursuant to this Article III.
Any interest and other income resulting from such investments shall be paid to
the Surviving Corporation on the earlier of (A) one (1) year after the
Effective Time or (B) the full payment of the Exchange Fund.

(b) Procedures for Surrender. Promptly after the Effective Time, Parent shall
cause the Exchange Agent to mail (and make available for collection by hand)
to each holder of record of a certificate or certificates which immediately
prior to the Effective Time represented outstanding Company Shares or Company
Preferred Shares (as applicable the " _Certificates_ "), or non-certificated
Company Shares or Company Preferred Shares represented by book-entry (as
applicable, "Book-Entry Shares") and whose Certificates and Book-Entry Shares,
as applicable, were converted pursuant to Section 3.1 into the right to
receive the applicable Merger Consideration (i) a letter of transmittal, which
shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to
the Certificates shall pass, only upon delivery of the Certificates
(or affidavits of loss in lieu thereof and, if required by Parent, an
indemnity bond) to the Exchange Agent and shall be in such form and have such
other provisions as Parent may reasonably specify (it being understood that
the forms of Letter of Transmittal to be mailed to the holders of Company
Common Stock and Company Preferred Stock may vary in certain respects due to
differences in the respective securities) and (ii) instructions for effecting
the surrender of the Certificates (or affidavits of loss in lieu thereof and,
if required by Parent, an indemnity bond) or Book-Entry Shares in exchange for
payment of the applicable Merger Consideration into which such Company Shares
or Company Preferred Shares, as applicable, have been converted pursuant to
Section 3.1, including any amount payable in respect of Fractional Share
Consideration in accordance with Section 3.6, and any dividends or other
distributions on shares of Parent Common Stock in accordance with Section
3.2(f). Upon surrender of a Certificate (or an affidavit of loss in lieu
thereof and, if required by Parent, an indemnity bond) or Book-Entry Share
for cancellation to the Exchange Agent or to such other agent or agents as
may be appointed by Parent or the Surviving Corporation, together with such
letter of transmittal duly completed and validly executed in accordance with
the instructions thereto, and such other documents as may be required
pursuant to such instructions, the holder of such Certificate or

 



16  Book-Entry Share shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor the
applicable Merger Consideration pursuant to the provisions of this Article
III, any Fractional Share Consideration that such holder has the right to
receive pursuant to the provisions of Section 3.6, and any amounts that such
holder has the right to receive in respect of dividends or other distributions
on shares of Parent Common Stock in accordance with Section 3.2(f) for each
Company Share formerly represented by such Certificate or Book-Entry Share, to
be mailed (or made available for collection by hand if so elected by the
surrendering holder) within five (5) business days following the later to
occur of (x) the Election Deadline and the determination of proration pursuant
to Section 3.1(e) or (y) the Exchange Agents receipt of such Certificate (or
affidavit of loss in lieu thereof and, if required by Parent, an indemnity
bond) or Book-Entry Share, and the Certificate (or affidavit of loss in lieu
thereof and, if required by Parent, an indemnity bond) or Book-Entry Share so
surrendered shall be forthwith cancelled. The Exchange Agent shall accept such
Certificates (or affidavits of loss in lieu thereof and, if required by
Parent, an indemnity bond) or Book-Entry Shares upon compliance with such
reasonable terms and conditions as the Exchange Agent may impose to effect an
orderly exchange thereof in accordance with normal exchange practices.
Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, at Parents election, Parent
may instruct the Exchange Agent to automatically convert Book-Entry Shares
into the applicable Merger Consideration without any required action on the
part of the holders of such Book-Entry Shares. If payment of the applicable
Merger Consideration is to be made to a Person other than the Person in whose
name the surrendered Certificate is registered, it shall be a condition
precedent of payment that (A) the Certificate so surrendered shall be
properly endorsed or shall be otherwise in proper form for transfer and (B)
the Person requesting such payment shall have paid any transfer and other
similar Taxes required by reason of the payment of the applicable Merger
Consideration to a Person other than the registered holder of the Certificate
surrendered or shall have established to the satisfaction of Parent that such
Tax either has been paid or is not required to be paid. Payment of the
applicable Merger Consideration with respect to Book-Entry Shares shall only
be made to the Person in whose name such Book-Entry Shares are
registered. Until surrendered as contemplated by this Section 3.2, each
Certificate and Book-Entry Share shall be deemed at any time after the
Effective Time to represent only the right to receive the applicable Merger
Consideration as contemplated by this Article III, including any amount
payable in respect of Fractional Share Consideration in accordance with
Section 3.6, and any dividends or other distributions on shares of Parent
Common Stock in accordance with Section 3.2(f), in each case without interest
thereon.

(c) Transfer Books; No Further Ownership Rights in Company Shares or Company
Preferred Shares. At the Effective Time, the stock transfer books of the
Company shall be closed and thereafter there shall be no further registration
of transfers of Company Shares or Company Preferred Shares on the records of
the Company. From and after the Effective Time, the holders of Certificates or
Book-Entry Shares outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall
cease to have any rights with respect to such Company Shares or Company
Preferred Shares, as applicable, except as otherwise provided for herein. If,
after the Effective Time, Certificates or Book-Entry Shares are presented to
the Surviving Corporation for any reason, they shall be cancelled and
exchanged as provided in this Agreement.

(d) Termination of Exchange Fund; No Liability. At any time following the
first (1st) anniversary of the Effective Time, Parent shall be entitled to
require the Exchange Agent to deliver to it any funds (including any interest
received with respect thereto) remaining in the Exchange Fund that have not
been disbursed, or for which disbursement to holders of Certificates or Book-
Entry Shares is pending subject only to the Exchange Agents routine
administrative procedures, and thereafter such holders shall be entitled to
look only to the Surviving Corporation

 



17  and Parent (subject to abandoned property, escheat or other similar Laws) as
general creditors thereof with respect to the applicable Merger Consideration,
including any amount payable in respect of Fractional Share Consideration in
accordance with Section 3.6, and any dividends or other distributions on
shares of Parent Common Stock in accordance with Section 3.2(f), payable upon
due surrender of their Certificates or Book-Entry Shares and compliance with
the procedures in Section 3.2(b), without any interest thereon.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, none of the Surviving Corporation, Parent or
the Exchange Agent shall be liable to any holder of a Certificate or Book-
Entry Share for any Merger Consideration or other amounts delivered to a
public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or
similar Law. 

(e) Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates. In the event that any Certificates
shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, the Exchange Agent shall issue in
exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificates, upon the making of
an affidavit of that fact by the holder thereof and, if required by Parent, an
indemnity bond, the applicable Merger Consideration payable in respect
thereof pursuant to Section 3.1 hereof, including any amount payable in
respect of Fractional Share Consideration in accordance with Section 3.6, and
any dividends or other distributions on shares of Parent Common Stock
in accordance with Section 3.2(f).

(f) Dividends or Other Distributions with Respect to Parent Common Stock. No
dividends or other distributions with respect to Parent Common Stock with a
record date after the Effective Time shall be paid to the holder of any
unsurrendered Certificate or Book-Entry Share with respect to the shares of
Parent Common Stock issuable hereunder (for the avoidance of doubt, only with
respect to the Common Merger Consideration), and all such dividends and other
distributions shall be paid by Parent to the Exchange Agent and shall be
included in the Exchange Fund, in each case until the surrender of such
Certificate or Book-Entry Share (or affidavit of loss in lieu thereof) in
accordance with this Agreement. Subject to applicable Laws, following
surrender of any such Certificate or Book-Entry Share (or affidavit of loss
in lieu thereof) there shall be paid to the holder thereof, without interest,
(i) the amount of dividends or other distributions with a record date after
the Effective Time theretofore paid with respect to such shares of Parent
Common Stock to which such holder is entitled pursuant to this Agreement and
(ii) at the appropriate payment date, the amount of dividends or
other distributions with a record date after the Effective Time but prior to
such surrender and with a payment date subsequent to such surrender payable
with respect to such shares of Parent Common Stock.

 

3.3 Dissenters Rights. No dissenters or appraisal rights shall be available
with respect to the Merger or the other Transactions.

3.4 Treatment of Company RSUs.

 

(a) Each Company RSU that is outstanding as of immediately prior to the
Effective Time, whether vested or unvested, shall be cancelled and converted
into the right to receive the Mixed Consideration in respect of each share of
Company Common Stock underlying such Company RSU immediately prior to the
Effective Time (the " _RSU Consideration_ "), which amount shall be paid in
accordance with Section 3.4(c). Any holder of Company RSUs who becomes
entitled to receive a fraction of a share of Parent Common Stock (after
aggregating all shares represented by Company RSUs held by such individual)
shall receive, in lieu thereof, cash, without interest, in an amount equal to
such fractional part of a share of Parent Common Stock, multiplied by the
Parent Trading Price, less any applicable Tax withholding, payable in
accordance with Section 3.4(c).

 



18 (b) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company Board of Directors (or the
appropriate committee(s) thereof) shall pass resolutions as are necessary for
the treatment of the Company RSUs as contemplated by this Section 3.4.

 

(c) The Parties will coordinate to cause any cash payments required pursuant
to this Section 3.4 to be made no later than twenty-one (21) days after the
Effective Time.

3.5 Withholding. Parent, Purchaser, the Surviving Corporation and
the Exchange Agent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from amounts
otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement, any amounts as are required to
be withheld or deducted with respect to such payment under the Code, or any
other applicable Tax Law. To the extent that amounts are so deducted or
withheld and remitted to the appropriate Governmental Entity, such amounts
shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the
Person in respect of which such deduction or withholding was made.

3.6 Fractional Shares. No certificate or scrip representing fractional shares
of Parent Common Stock shall be issued upon the surrender for exchange of
Certificates or Book-Entry Shares, and such fractional share interests shall
not entitle the owner thereof to vote or to any other rights of a stockholder
of Parent. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, each holder
of Company Shares converted pursuant to the Merger who would otherwise have
been entitled to receive a fraction of a share of Parent Common Stock (after
aggregating all shares represented by the Certificates and Book-Entry Shares
delivered by such holder) shall receive, in lieu thereof, cash, without
interest, in an amount equal to such fractional part of a share of Parent
Common Stock multiplied by the Parent Trading Price.

no holder of Company Common Stock or Company Preferred Stock has the right to
demand as a result of the Merger or otherwise the fair value of their shares
in accordance with the MGCL.

 



21 4.3 Corporate Authority.

 

(a) The Company has the corporate power and authority to execute and deliver

the Merger. The execution and delivery of this Agreement and the consummation
of the Transactions have been duly and validly authorized by the Company Board
of Directors and no other corporate proceedings on the part of the Company
are necessary to authorize the consummation of, and to consummate, the
Transactions, except, with respect to the Merger, for the filing of the
Articles of Merger with and acceptance for record of the Articles of Merger by
the Maryland Department. On or prior to the date hereof, at a meeting duly
called and held, the Company Board of Directors, acting upon the unanimous

its covenants and agreements contained herein and the consummation of the
Offer, the Merger and the other Transactions upon the terms and subject to the
conditions contained herein, and (iv) resolved to recommend that the holders
of shares of Company Common Stock accept the Offer and tender their shares of
Company Common Stock to Purchaser pursuant to the Offer. As of the date
hereof, none of the foregoing actions by the Company Board of Directors have
been rescinded or modified in any way.

(b) Assuming the Minimum Condition is satisfied and the terms of the
Parent Series H Preferred Stock to be issued to the holders of the Company
Preferred Stock pursuant to Section 3.1(d) are as set forth in the articles
supplementary in the form set forth in Annex C, no vote of the holders of
Company Shares, Company Preferred Shares or other capital stock of the
Company is necessary to adopt this Agreement and consummate the Merger or
other Transactions under applicable Law and the Company Governing Documents.

Company and, assuming this Agreement constitutes the valid and binding
agreement of Parent and Purchaser, constitutes the valid and binding agreement

applicable Law, for the consummation by the Company of the Transactions,

or filings that, if not obtained or made, would not reasonably be expected to
have, individually or in the aggregate, a Company Material Adverse Effect.

 



22 (b) The execution and delivery by the Company of this Agreement do not, and,
except as described in Section 4.4(a) of the Company Disclosure Letter, the
consummation of the Transactions and compliance with the provisions hereof
will not (i) conflict with or result in any violation or breach of, or default
or change of control (with or without notice or lapse of time, or both)
under, or give rise to a right of, or result in, termination, modification,
cancellation or acceleration of any obligation or to the loss of a benefit
under, or right of amendment to a third party or vesting of any Contract
binding upon the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries or result in the
creation of any Lien upon any of the properties, rights or assets of the
Company or any Company Subsidiaries, other than Permitted Liens, (ii)
conflict with or result in any violation of any provision of the Company
Governing Documents or the organizational documents of any Company Subsidiary,

(a) From December 31, 2015, the Company has timely (including following any
extensions of time for filing provided by Rule 12b-25 promulgated under the
Exchange Act) filed or furnished all forms, documents and reports required to
be filed or furnished by it with the SEC under the Securities Act or the
Exchange Act (such forms, documents and reports, the " _Company SEC

the date hereof, as of the date of (and giving effect to) the last such
amendment made prior to the date hereof, the Company SEC Documents complied
as to form in all material respects with the requirements of the Sarbanes-
Oxley Act, the Securities Act and the Exchange Act, as the case may be, and
the applicable rules and regulations promulgated thereunder and the listing

Company SEC Documents contained (or, with respect to Company SEC Documents
filed after the date hereof, will not contain) any untrue statement of a
material fact or omitted to state any material fact required to be stated
therein or necessary to make the statements therein, in light of the
circumstances under which they were made, not misleading.

 

(b) Each of the consolidated financial statements contained or incorporated by
reference in the Company SEC Documents (as amended, supplemented or restated,
if applicable), including the related notes and schedules, was prepared
(except as indicated in the notes thereto including, in the case of interim
financial statements, for normal and recurring year-end adjustments and
as may be permitted by the SEC on Form 10-Q or Form 8-K under the Exchange
Act and absence of all notes thereto) in accordance with United States
Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (" _GAAP_ ") applied on a consistent
basis throughout the periods indicated, and each such consolidated financial
statement presented fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated
financial position, results of operations, stockholders equity and cash flows
of the Company and its consolidated Subsidiaries as of the respective dates
thereof and for the respective periods indicated therein (subject, in the case

procedures are reasonably designed to ensure that all material information
required to be disclosed by the Company in the reports that it files or
furnishes under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and

Companys management as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding

any Laws (including Environmental Laws) applicable to the Company, such
Subsidiaries or any of their respective properties or assets, except where
such non-compliance, default or violation has not had and would
not reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a
Company Material Adverse Effect. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in
this Section 4.9(a), the provisions of this Section 4.9(a) shall not apply to
matters addressed in Section 4.9(c), Section 4.10, Section 4.11 and Section

applicable Law necessary for the Company and the Company Subsidiaries to own,
lease and operate their properties and assets or to carry on their businesses
as they are now being conducted (the " _Company Permits_ "), except where the
failure to have any of the Company Permits has not had and would not

Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, since December 31, 2015, neither the Company

domestic or foreign anti-bribery or anti-corruption laws (collectively, "
_Bribery Legislation_ ").

 

(d) Except as has not been and would not reasonably be expected to be,
individually or in the aggregate, material to the Company and the Company
Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, since December 31, 2015, neither the Company
nor the Company Subsidiaries have been subject to any actual, pending, or, to

accurate and complete copies of all claims submitted by the Company or any of
the Company Subsidiaries pursuant to the No-Action Letter and any other

or both, would constitute a default or violation of any term, condition or
provision of any Operator Permit, and there are no facts or circumstances
which could form the basis for any such default or violation, in each case
except as had not had and would not reasonably be expected to have,
individually or in the aggregate, a Company Material Adverse Effect. To the
Knowledge of the Company, there are no legal proceedings pending or
threatened, relating to the suspension, revocation or modification of any
material Operator Permit. To the Knowledge of the Company, none of the
Operator Permits will be impaired or in any material way affected by the
consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

4.10 Employee Benefit Plans.

 

(a) Section 4.10(a) of the Company Disclosure Letter sets forth each material
Company Benefit Plan. For purposes of this Agreement, " _Company Benefit
Plans_ " means each employee benefit plan (as defined in Section 3(3) of
ERISA), whether or not subject to ERISA, and each bonus, stock, stock option
or other equity-based compensation arrangement or plan, incentive, deferred
compensation, retirement or supplemental retirement, severance, employment,
change-in-control, collective bargaining, profit sharing, pension, vacation,
cafeteria, dependent care, medical care, employee assistance program,
education or tuition assistance programs, and each insurance and

 



26  other similar fringe or employee benefit plan, policy, program, agreement or
arrangement, in each case, for the benefit of current employees, directors or
consultants (or any dependent or beneficiary thereof) of the Company or any
Company Subsidiary or any of their ERISA Affiliates or with respect to which
the Company or any Company Subsidiary has any obligation or liability
including any plan, program, policy, or practice that is sponsored by a
professional employer organization or co-employer organization (each, a "
_PEO_ ") under which an employee of the Company or any of its subsidiaries may
be eligible to receive benefits in connection with the Companys engagement
of a PEO (each, a " _PEO Company Benefit Plan_ "); _provided, however,_ that
the Company Benefit Plans shall not include any plans that both (x) do not
cover current or former employees of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
and (y) are sponsored or maintained by MTGE Management, LLC or any of its
ERISA Affiliates; _provided further_ , however, that the Parties agree that
neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries shall be deemed an ERISA
Affiliate of MTGE Management, LLC for purposes of this Section 4.10(a). Each
Company Employee Plan that is not a PEO Company Employee Plan is referred to
in this Agreement as a " _Sponsored Company Benefit Plan_." With respect to
each material Company Benefit Plan (and, in the case of any PEO Company
Benefit Plan, to the extent provided to the Company by the PEO and in the
possession of the Company), the Company has made available to Parent correct
and complete copies of (or, to the extent no such copy exists, a description
of), in each case, to the extent applicable, (i) all plan documents, summary
plan descriptions, summaries of material modifications, and
amendments related to such plans and any related trust agreement; (ii) the
most recent Form 5500 Annual Report; (iii) the most recent audited financial
statement and actuarial valuation; (iv) all material filings and
correspondence with any Governmental Entity; and (v) all material related
agreements, insurance contracts and other agreements which implement each such
Company Benefit Plan.

Company Benefit Plans, and to the knowledge of the Company each PEO Company
Benefit Plan, has been operated and administered in compliance with applicable
Laws, including, but not limited to, ERISA, the Code and in each case
the regulations thereunder. No liability under Title IV of ERISA that would
reasonably be expected to be material to the Company and the Company
Subsidiaries taken as a whole has been incurred by the Company, the Company
Subsidiaries or any of their respective ERISA Affiliates that has not been
satisfied in full, and to the knowledge of the Company no condition exists
that is likely to cause the Company, the Company Subsidiaries or any of their
ERISA Affiliates to incur a liability that would reasonably be expected to be
material to the Company and the Company Subsidiaries taken as a whole
thereunder. Except as would not result in a material liability to the Company,
all contributions or other amounts payable by the Company or the Company
Subsidiaries pursuant to each Company Benefit Plan in respect of current or
prior plan years have been timely paid or accrued in accordance with GAAP or
applicable international accounting standards. Except as would not,
individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Company
Material Adverse Effect, neither the Company nor any of the Company
Subsidiaries has engaged in a transaction in connection with which the Company
or any of the Company Subsidiaries could be subject to either a civil penalty
assessed pursuant to Section 409 or 502(i) of ERISA or a Tax imposed pursuant
to Section 4975 or 4976 of the Code. There are no pending, or to the knowledge
of the Company, threatened or anticipated claims, actions, investigations or
audits (other than routine claims for benefits) by, on behalf of or against
any of the Company Benefit Plans or any trusts related thereto that would
reasonably be expected to result in a material liability.

 



27 (c) No Company Benefit Plan (i) is subject to Title IV or Section 302 of
ERISA or Section 412 or 4971 of the Code, (ii) is a "multiemployer plan" (as
such term is defined in Section 3(37) of ERISA), or (iii) a plan that has two
or more contributing sponsors at least two of whom are not under common
control, within the meaning of Section 4063 of ERISA.

(d) No Company Benefit Plan provides retiree medical benefits (whether or not
insured), with respect to current or former employees or directors of the
Company or the Company Subsidiaries following their retirement or other
termination of service, other than coverage mandated by the Consolidated
Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1985, as amended, or comparable U.S.
state Law.

(e) (i) Each of the Sponsored Company Benefit Plans that is intended to be
"qualified" within the meaning of Section 401(a) of the Code has received a
favorable determination letter or opinion letter as to its qualification, and
(ii) to the knowledge of the Company there are no existing circumstances or
any events that have occurred that would reasonably be expected to adversely
affect the qualified status of any such plan. Each such favorable
determination letter has been provided or made available to Parent.

 

(f) Except as provided under Section 3.4, neither the execution and delivery
of this Agreement nor the consummation of the Transactions (either alone or
in conjunction with any other event) will (i) entitle to compensation or any
benefit or result in any payment (including severance, unemployment
compensation, "excess parachute payment" (within the meaning of Section 280G
of the Code), forgiveness of Indebtedness or otherwise) becoming due to any
current or former director or any employee of the Company or any Company
Subsidiary under any Company Benefit Plan, (ii) increase any compensation,
equity award or any other benefits otherwise payable under any Company Benefit
Plan, (iii) result in any acceleration of the time of payment, funding or
vesting of any such compensation, equity award or other benefits or
trigger any other material obligation under any Company Benefit Plan, or (iv)
result in any breach or violation of, or default under or limit the Companys
right to amend, modify, terminate or transfer the assets of, any Company
Benefit Plan.

 

(g) Each Sponsored Company Benefit Plan has been maintained and operated in
documentary and operational compliance in all materials respects with Section
409A of the Code or an available exemption therefrom.

additional Taxes payable pursuant to Section 409A of the Code.

notice from any insurance company since January 1, 2017 that has issued a
policy with respect to any Company Property requiring performance of any
structural or other repairs or alterations to such Company Property which the
failure to perform such repairs or alterations would void the
applicable insurance policy and which repairs or alterations have not been
made.

(e) Neither the Company nor any Company Subsidiary owns, holds, is obligated
under or is a party to, any option, right of first refusal or other
contractual right to purchase, acquire, sell, assign or dispose of any real
estate or any portion thereof or interest therein.

Exchange Act) filed or furnished all forms, documents and reports required to
be filed or furnished by it with the SEC under the Securities Act or the
Exchange Act prior to the date hereof (such forms, documents and reports

of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, the Securities Act and the Exchange Act, as the

purpose entity or Person, on the other hand, or any off-balance
sheet arrangements (as defined in Item 303(a) of Regulation S-K of the SEC)

designed to ensure that all material information required to be disclosed by
Parent in the reports that it files or furnishes under the Exchange Act is
recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified
in the rules and forms of the SEC, and that all such material information is
accumulated and communicated to Parents management as appropriate to allow
timely decisions regarding required disclosure and to make the certifications
required pursuant to Sections 302 and 906 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. Since
December 31, 2015, Parents principal executive officer and its principal

financial information and (b) any known fraud, whether or not material, that
involves management or other employees who have a significant role in Parents
internal controls over financial reporting. Since December 31, 2015, neither
Parent nor any Parent Subsidiary has received any material, unresolved,
written complaint, allegation, assertion or claim regarding the accounting or
auditing practices, procedures, methodologies or methods of Parent or the
Parent Subsidiaries or their respective internal accounting controls. Since

have been filed on their behalf) with the appropriate Governmental Entity all
U.S. federal income and all other material Tax Returns required to be filed by
them, taking into account any extensions of

 



43  time within which to file such Tax Returns, and all such Tax Returns are
true, correct and complete in all material respects, and (ii) duly and timely
paid in full (or there has been duly and timely paid in full on their
behalf), or made adequate provision for, all material amounts of Taxes
required to be paid by them, whether or not shown (or required to be shown) on
any Tax Return.

 

(b) Parent (i) for its taxable years commencing with Parents taxable year
that ended on December 31, 1997 and through and including its taxable year
ended December 31, 2017 has been subject to taxation as a REIT and has
satisfied all requirements to qualify as a REIT in such years; (ii) has
operated since January 1, 2018 until the date hereof in a manner consistent
with the requirements for qualification and taxation as a REIT; (iii) intends
to continue to operate in such a manner as to qualify as a REIT for its
taxable year ending December 31, 2018; and (iv) has not to its knowledge
taken or omitted to take any action that could reasonably be expected to
result in a successful challenge by the IRS or any other Governmental Entity
to its qualification as a REIT, and to the knowledge of Parent, no such
challenge is pending or threatened.

(c) Each Parent Subsidiary (other than Purchaser) has been since the later of
its acquisition or formation treated for U.S. federal income (and applicable
state) Tax purposes as (i) a partnership (or a disregarded entity) and not as
a corporation or an association, a publicly traded partnership taxable as a
corporation, or a taxable mortgage pool, (ii) a Qualified REIT Subsidiary of
Parent, or (iii) a Taxable REIT Subsidiary of Parent. For U.S. federal income
tax purposes, Purchaser has at all times been treated as (i) a Qualified REIT
Subsidiary of Parent and (ii) a "disregarded entity" within the meaning of
Section 1.368-2(b)(1)(i)(A) of the Treasury Regulations that is disregarded as
separate from Parent.

 

(d) Neither Parent nor any Parent Subsidiary holds, directly or indirectly,
any asset the disposition of which would be subject to (or to rules similar
to) Section 1374 of the Code.

(e) (i) There are no disputes, audits, examination, investigations
or proceedings pending (or threatened in writing), or written claims
asserted, for and/or in respect of any material Taxes or material Tax Returns
of Parent or any Parent Subsidiary and neither Parent nor any Parent
Subsidiary is a party to any litigation or administrative proceeding relating
to Taxes; (ii) no deficiency for Taxes of Parent or any Parent Subsidiary has
been claimed, proposed or assessed in writing or, to the knowledge of Parent,
threatened, by any Governmental Entity, which deficiency has not yet been
settled, except for such deficiencies which are being contested in good faith
or with respect to which the failure to pay, individually or in the aggregate,
has not had and would not reasonably be expected to have a Parent Material
Adverse Effect; (iii) neither Parent nor any Parent Subsidiary has extended or
waived (nor granted any extension or waiver of) the limitation period for the
assessment or collection of any Tax that has not since expired; (iv) neither
Parent nor any Parent Subsidiary currently is the beneficiary of any extension
of time within which to file any material Tax Return that remains unfiled
other than automatic extensions of time obtained in the ordinary course
of business; (v) neither Parent nor any Parent Subsidiary has received a
written claim by any Governmental Entity in any jurisdiction where any of them
does not file Tax Returns or pay any Taxes that it is or may be subject to
taxation by that jurisdiction; and (vi) neither Parent nor any Parent
Subsidiary has entered into any "closing agreement" as described in Section
7121 of the Code (or any corresponding or similar provision of state, local or
foreign income Tax Law).

(f) Neither Parent nor any Parent Subsidiary has incurred any liability for
excise Taxes under Sections 857(b), 860(c) or 4981 of the Code which have not
been previously paid. Neither Parent nor any Parent Subsidiary (other than a
Taxable REIT Subsidiary or a Subsidiary of a

 



44  Taxable REIT Subsidiary) has engaged at any time in any "prohibited
transactions" within the meaning of Section 857(b)(6) of the Code. Neither
Parent nor any Parent Subsidiary has engaged in any transaction that would
give rise to "redetermined rents," "redetermined deductions," "excess
interest" or "redetermined TRS service income" described in Section 857(b)(7)
of the Code. To the knowledge of Parent, no event has occurred, and no
condition or circumstance exists, which presents a material risk that any
material Tax described in the previous sentences will be imposed upon Parent
or any Parent Subsidiary.

 

(g) Parent and each Parent Subsidiary have complied in all material respects
with all applicable Laws relating to the payment and withholding of Taxes
(including withholding of Taxes pursuant to Sections 1441, 1442, 1445, 1446,
1471-1474, 3102 and 3402 of the Code or similar provisions under any state and
foreign Laws) and have duly and timely withheld and, in each case, have paid
over to the appropriate Governmental Entities any and all material amounts
required to be so withheld and paid over on or prior to the due date thereof
under all applicable Laws.

 

(h) There are no material Tax Liens upon any property or assets of Parent or
any Parent Subsidiary except Liens for Taxes not yet due and payable or that
are being contested in good faith by appropriate proceedings and for which
adequate reserves have been established in accordance with GAAP.

 

(i) Neither Parent nor any Parent Subsidiary has requested, has received or is
subject to any written ruling of a Governmental Entity or has entered into
any written agreement with a Governmental Entity with respect to any Taxes
that is still in effect.

(j) There are no Tax allocation or sharing agreements or similar arrangements
with respect to or involving Parent or any Parent Subsidiary, and after the
Closing Date neither Parent nor any Parent Subsidiary shall be bound by any
such Tax allocation agreements or similar arrangements or have any liability
thereunder for amounts due in respect of periods prior to the Closing Date, in
each case, other than any agreements entered into in the ordinary course of
business, the principal purpose of which is unrelated to Taxes.

(k) Neither Parent nor any Parent Subsidiary (i) has been a member of an
affiliated group filing a consolidated U.S. federal income Tax Return (other
than a Parent Subsidiary taxable as a Taxable REIT Subsidiary) or (ii) has any
liability for the Taxes of any Person (other than Parent or any Parent
Subsidiary) under Treasury Regulations Section 1.1502-6 (or any similar
provision of state, local, or foreign law), as a transferee or successor, or
otherwise.

(l) Neither Parent nor any Parent Subsidiary has participated in any "listed
transaction" within the meaning of Treasury Regulations Section
1.6011-4(b)(2).

 

(m) Neither Parent nor any Parent Subsidiary (other than Taxable REIT
Subsidiaries) has or has had any earnings and profits attributable to such
entity or any other corporation in any non-REIT year within the meaning of
Section 857 of the Code.

(n) Neither Parent nor Purchaser is aware of any fact or circumstance that
would reasonably be expected to prevent the Offer and the Merger, taken
together, from qualifying as a "reorganization" within the meaning of Section
368(a) of the Code.

 



45 (o) Neither Parent nor any of the Parent Subsidiaries has constituted either
a "distributing corporation" or a "controlled corporation" (within the
meaning of Section 355(a) of the Code) in a distribution of stock qualifying
for tax-free treatment under Section 355 of the Code in the two (2) years
prior to the date of this Agreement.

(p) This Section 5.14 constitutes the exclusive representations
and warranties of Parent with respect to Tax matters.

5.15 Stock Ownership. None of Parent or any Parent Subsidiary for the past
five years has been an "interested stockholder" (as defined in Section
3-601(j) of the MGCL) of the Company. None of Parent or any Parent Subsidiary
is a "beneficial owner" (as defined in Section 3-601(d) of the MGCL) of
any Company Shares as of the date hereof.

5\. 16 Investment Company Act. Neither Parent nor any Parent Subsidiaries is,
or as of immediately prior to the Effective Time will be, required to be
registered as an investment company under the Investment Company Act.

 

5.17 No Other Representations. Except for the representations and warranties
contained in Article IV, Parent acknowledges that neither the Company nor any
Representative of the Company makes, and Parent acknowledges that it has not
relied upon or otherwise been induced by, any other express or implied
representation or warranty with respect to the Company or any of the
Company Subsidiaries or with respect to any other information provided or
made available to Parent in connection with the Transactions, including any
information, documents, projections, forward-looking statements, forecasts or
other material made available to Parent or to Parents Representatives in
certain "data rooms" or management presentations in expectation of the
Transactions or the accuracy or completeness of any of the foregoing.

respectively, and for which the proper adjustment is made;

6.3 Non-Solicitation by the Company.

 

(a) From and after the date of this Agreement until the earlier of the
Acceptance Time or the date, if any, on which this Agreement is validly
terminated pursuant to Section 9.1, and except as otherwise provided in this
Section 6.3, the Company agrees that it (including the Company Board of
Directors) shall not, and shall cause each Company Subsidiary and
Representative not to, directly or indirectly: (i) solicit, initiate or
knowingly encourage or facilitate (including by way of providing non-public
information) any inquiry, proposal or offer, or the making, submission or
announcement of any inquiry, proposal or offer which constitutes or would be
reasonably expected to

 



53  lead to an Acquisition Proposal, (ii) participate in any negotiations
regarding, or furnish to any Person any non-public information relating to the
Company or any Company Subsidiary in connection with, an actual or potential
Acquisition Proposal (other than to state that the terms of this Agreement
prohibit such negotiations), (iii) approve or recommend, or propose publicly
to approve or recommend, any Acquisition Proposal, (iv) withdraw, change,
amend, modify or qualify, or otherwise propose publicly to withdraw, change,
amend, modify or qualify, in a manner adverse to Parent, the Company Board
Recommendation, (v) if an Acquisition Proposal that is an exchange or tender

Acquisition Proposal within ten (10) business days of being requested to do so
by Parent ( _provided_ that Parent may not make more than one request with
respect to any such Acquisition Proposal unless such Acquisition Proposal is
amended or supplemented, in which case Parent may make one request with
respect to each amendment or supplement), (vi) if an Acquisition Proposal has
been publicly disclosed, fail to reaffirm the Company Board Recommendation
within ten (10) business days of being requested to do so by Parent (
_provided_ that Parent may not make more than one request with respect to any
such Acquisition Proposal unless such Acquisition Proposal is amended or
supplemented, in which case Parent may make one request with respect to each
amendment or supplement), (vii) enter into any merger agreement, acquisition
agreement, reorganization agreement, letter of intent or similar agreement or
document relating to, or any other agreement or commitment providing for, any
Acquisition Proposal (other than an Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement to
the extent permitted by this Section 6.3), or (viii) resolve or agree to do
any of the foregoing (any act described in clauses (iii), (iv), (v), (vi) and
(viii) (to the extent related to the foregoing clauses (iii), (iv), (v) and
(vi)) above, a " _Change of Recommendation_ "). The Company shall, and shall
cause the Company Subsidiaries and its and their respective directors,
officers, employees and other Representatives (including the Company Manager)
to, immediately cease any and all existing discussions or negotiations with
any parties (or provision of any non-public information to any parties)
conducted heretofore with respect to any Acquisition Proposal or potential
Acquisition Proposal. Promptly after the date hereof, the Company shall
request that each Person that has heretofore within the preceding eighteen
(18) months executed a confidentiality agreement relating to an Acquisition
Proposal or a potential Acquisition Proposal promptly destroy or return to
the Company all non-public information relating to such Acquisition Proposal
or to the Company or its businesses or assets heretofore furnished by the
Company or any of its Representatives to such Person or group or any of
its representatives in accordance with the terms of such confidentiality
agreement ( _provided_ that no such request is required to be made for
confidentiality agreements executed more than one (1) year prior to the date
hereof if the Company has made a similar request prior to the date hereof).
For purposes of this Section 6.3, the term " _Person_ " means any Person or
"group," as defined in Section 13(d) of the Exchange Act, other than,
with respect to the Company, Parent or any Parent Subsidiaries or any of
their Representatives. Notwithstanding the foregoing, submission of an
Acquisition Proposal by the Company Manager or its affiliates and their
actions related thereto shall not be deemed a breach or violation of this
Section 6.3(a) so long as the directors and officers and other Representatives
of the Company not otherwise affiliated with the Company Manager did not take
actions that would breach or violate this Section 6.3(a) with respect to such
Acquisition Proposal.

(b) Notwithstanding the limitations set forth in Section 6.3(a), if the
Company receives, prior to the Acceptance Time, an unsolicited, written
Acquisition Proposal that did not result from a breach of this Section 6.3,
which the Company Board of Directors, upon the recommendation of the Company
Special Committee, determines in good faith after consultation with the
Companys outside legal and financial advisors (i) constitutes a Superior
Proposal or (ii) could reasonably be expected to result in a Superior
Proposal, and in each case that the failure to take

 



54  such action would be inconsistent with the directors duties under
applicable Law, then in either event the Company may take the following
actions: (x) furnish non-public information to the Person making such
Acquisition Proposal, if, and only if, prior to so furnishing such
information, the Company receives from such Person an executed Acceptable
Confidentiality Agreement and (y) engage in discussions or negotiations
with such Person with respect to the Acquisition Proposal.

(c) The Company shall promptly (and in any event within the earlier
of thirty-six (36) hours and one business day) notify Parent after receipt by
the Company, any of the Company Subsidiaries or any of their respective
Representatives of any Acquisition Proposal, any proposals or inquiries that
would reasonably be expected to lead to an Acquisition Proposal, or any
inquiry or request for non-public information relating to the Company or any
Company Subsidiary by any Person who has made or would reasonably be expected
to make any Acquisition Proposal. Such notice shall indicate the identity of
the Person making the Acquisition Proposal, inquiry or request, and the
material terms and conditions of any such proposal or offer or the nature of
the information requested pursuant to such inquiry or request, including
copies of all written requests, proposals, correspondence or offer, including
proposed agreements received by the Company, any of the Company Subsidiaries
or any of their respective Representatives. The Company shall keep Parent
reasonably informed on a prompt and timely basis of the status and material
terms (including any amendments or proposed amendments to such material terms)
of any such Acquisition Proposal or potential Acquisition Proposal and keep
Parent reasonably informed on a prompt and timely basis as to the nature of
any information requested of the Company with respect thereto and provide to
Parent copies of all written materials received or sent by the Company related
thereto. The Company shall promptly provide to Parent any material non-public
information concerning the Company provided to any other Person in connection
with any Acquisition Proposal that was not previously provided to Parent.
Without limiting the foregoing, the Company shall promptly (and in any event
within the earlier of thirty-six (36) hours and one business day after such
determination) inform Parent in writing if the Company determines to begin
providing information or to engage in discussions or negotiations concerning
an Acquisition Proposal pursuant to Section 6.3(b). Unless this Agreement has
been validly terminated pursuant to Section 9.1, the Company shall not take
any action to exempt any Person (other than Parent and Purchaser) from the
restrictions on "business combinations" contained in any applicable Takeover
Statute or, with respect to any Person who has made or is considering making
an Acquisition Proposal, stock ownership limitations contained in the Company
Governing Documents or otherwise cause such restrictions or limitations not
to apply.

(d) Notwithstanding anything in this Section 6.3 to the contrary, but subject
to Section 6.3(e), at any time prior to the Acceptance Time, the Company Board
of Directors may (i) make a Change of Recommendation in response to an
Intervening Event if the Company Board of Directors, upon the recommendation
of the Company Special Committee, has determined in good faith after
consultation with the Companys outside financial advisors and outside legal
counsel, that failure to take such action would be inconsistent with
the directors duties under applicable Law, or (ii) make a Change of
Recommendation and cause the Company to terminate this Agreement pursuant to
and in accordance with Section 9.1(g) in order to enter into a definitive
agreement providing for an unsolicited Acquisition Proposal, which the
Company Board of Directors determined in good faith after consultation with
the Companys outside legal and financial advisors is a Superior Proposal, but
only if the Company Board of Directors has determined, upon the
recommendation of the Company Special Committee, in good faith after
consultation with the

 



55  Companys outside financial advisors and outside legal counsel, that failure
to take such action would be inconsistent with the directors duties under
applicable Law. " _Intervening Event_ " means any event, change in
circumstance or development that is material to the Company and the Company
Subsidiaries (taken as a whole) and was not known or reasonably foreseeable by
the Company Board of Directors as of or prior to the date of this Agreement
and which becomes known to the Company Board of Directors prior to the
Acceptance Time; _provided, however,_ that in no event shall the following
events, developments or changes in circumstances, constitute an Intervening
Event: (A) the receipt, existence or terms of an Acquisition Proposal or any
matter relating thereto or consequence thereof or (B) changes, in and of
itself, in the market price or trading volume of the Company Common Stock or
Parent Common Stock or the fact that the Company meets or exceeds (or that
Parent fails to meet or exceed) internal or published projections, forecasts
or revenue or earnings predictions for any period.

 

(e) Prior to the Company taking any action permitted (i) under Section
6.3(d)(i), the Company shall provide Parent with three (3) business days
prior written notice advising Parent it intends to effect a Change of
Recommendation and specifying, in reasonable detail, the reasons therefor, and
during such three (3) business day period, the Company shall cause its
Representatives (including its executive officers) to negotiate in good faith
(to the extent Parent desires to negotiate (and if Parent does negotiate,
Parent shall cause its Representatives (including its executive officers) to
negotiate in good faith)) any proposal by Parent to amend the terms and
conditions of this Agreement in a manner that would obviate the need to effect
a Change of Recommendation and at the end of such three (3) business day
period the Company Board of Directors again makes the determination under
Section 6.3(d)(i) (after in good faith taking into account any amendments
proposed by Parent), or (ii) under Section 6.3(d)(ii), the Company shall
provide Parent with three (3) business days prior written notice advising
Parent that the Company Board of Directors intends to take such action and
specifying the material terms and conditions of the Acquisition Proposal, and
during such three (3) business day period, the Company shall cause its
Representatives (including its executive officers) to negotiate in good faith
(to the extent Parent desires to negotiate) any proposal by Parent to amend
the terms and conditions of this Agreement such that such Acquisition
Proposal would no longer constitute a Superior Proposal and at the end of such
three (3) business day period the Company Board of Directors again makes the
determination under Section 6.3(d)(ii) (after in good faith taking into
account the amendments proposed by Parent). With respect to Section
6.3(e)(ii), if there are any material amendments, revisions or changes to the
terms of any such Superior Proposal (including any revision to the amount,
form or mix of consideration the Companys stockholders would receive as a
result of the Superior Proposal, whether or not material), the Company shall
notify Parent of each such amendment, revision or change in compliance with
Section 6.3(c) and the applicable three (3) business day period shall be
extended until at least two (2) business days after the time that Parent
receives notification from the Company of each such amendment, revision or
change and the Company Board of Directors shall not make a Change of
Recommendation prior to the end of any such period as so extended in
accordance with the terms of this Section 6.3(e).

 

(f) Nothing in this Agreement shall prohibit the Company Board of Directors
from: (i) taking and disclosing to the stockholders of the Company a position
contemplated by Rule 14e-2(a), Rule 14d-9 or Item 1012(a) of Regulation M-A
promulgated under the Exchange Act, if failure to do so would violate
applicable Law or (ii) making any "stop, look and listen" communication to
the Companys stockholders pursuant to Rule 14d-9(f) promulgated under the
Exchange Act; provided that this Section 6.3(f) shall not permit the Company
Board of Directors to make a Change of Recommendation except to the extent
permitted by Section 6.3(d) and Section 6.3(e).

 



56 (g) References in this Section 6.3 or in Article I to the " _Company Board of
Directors_ " shall mean the Company Board of Directors or, to the extent
applicable, a committee thereof, including the Company Special Committee.

 

6.4 Additional Dividends.

 

(a) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall declare a dividend to its
stockholders, the record date for which shall be the close of business on the
fourth business day prior to the day on which the Acceptance Time occurs, and
the payment date for which shall be the business day on which the Acceptance
Time occurs, subject to funds being legally available therefor; provided that
the payment of such dividend may be conditioned upon the occurrence of the
Acceptance Time; _provided, further_ , that the Company shall, not later than
the payment date described above for such dividend, set aside and deliver to
the paying agent for the payment of such dividend, the aggregate amount
required to be paid pursuant to such dividend, and in no event shall Parent
fund, directly or indirectly, the payment of such dividend. The per share
dividend amount payable by the Company pursuant to this Section 6.4(a) shall
be an amount equal to (i) the Companys then-most recent quarterly dividend
(on a per share basis), multiplied by the number of days elapsed since the
last dividend record date through and including the business day prior to the
day on which the Acceptance Time occurs, and divided by the actual number of
days in the calendar quarter in which such dividend is declared, plus (ii) an
additional amount (the " _Company Additional Dividend Amount_ "), if any,
necessary so that the aggregate dividend payable is equal to the Minimum
Distribution Dividend.

 

(b) The Company and Parent shall cooperate in good faith to determine whether
it is necessary to declare a Company Additional Dividend Amount and the
amount (if any) of the Company Additional Dividend Amount. Such determination
shall be made at least twelve (12) days prior to the then-applicable
expiration date of the Offer. It is expected that, in addition to
regular quarterly dividends, notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to
the contrary, Parent will declare and pay a stub-period dividend to its
stockholders, with a record date as of the close of business on the last
business day prior to the day on which the Acceptance Time occurs, on a
comparable basis as the Company dividend paid pursuant to Section 6.4(a)(i)
(provided that Parent shall be permitted to take into account increases or
anticipated increases in such dividend amount contemplated by Section
6.2(ii)(a)(i)), and including an additional per share amount equal to the
Company Additional Dividend Amount (if any) (on a per share basis), divided by
0.9519.

 

ARTICLE VII

ADDITIONAL AGREEMENTS

7.1 Access; Confidentiality; Notice of Certain Events.

 

(a) From the date of this Agreement until the Effective Time or the date, if
any, on which this Agreement is terminated pursuant to Section 9.1, to the
extent permitted by applicable Law, each of the Company and Parent shall, and
shall cause each of the Parent Subsidiaries and the Company Subsidiaries,
respectively, to afford to the other Party and to the Representatives of such
other Party reasonable access during normal business hours and upon reasonable
advance notice to

 



57  all of their respective properties, Contracts, personnel (which, for the
avoidance of doubt, with respect to the Company shall not include the Company
Managers portfolio management personnel), books and records and, during such
period, the Company shall, and shall cause the Company Subsidiaries to,
furnish reasonably promptly to Parent information (financial or otherwise)
concerning its business, properties and personnel as Parent may reasonably
request, including but not limited to (x) information regarding financing
reporting, cash management, accounts payable and receivable and portfolio
level information, and (y) the duration, as calculated using the Blackrock
Solutions model, of the portfolio of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries
and the notional balance of Company MBS, "To Be Announced" agency mortgage-
backed securities, credit risk transfer securities, legacy
residential mortgage-backed securities and swaptions (collectively, the "
_Portfolio Information_ "), and, at the reasonable request of Parent, the
Company shall provide regular updates to Parent regarding its portfolio risk
and portfolio activities, including through weekly delivery of the Portfolio
Information. Notwithstanding the foregoing, neither the Company nor Parent
shall be required by this Section 7.1 to provide the other Party or the
Representatives of such other Party with access to or to disclose information
(A) that is subject to the terms of a confidentiality agreement with a third
party entered into prior to the date of this Agreement or entered into after
the date of this Agreement in the ordinary course of business consistent with
past practice ( _provided, however,_ that the withholding Party shall use its
reasonable best efforts to obtain the required consent of such third party to
such access or disclosure or, if unable to do so, to make appropriate
substitute arrangements to permit reasonable access or disclosure not in
violation of such consent requirement), (B) the disclosure of which would
violate any Law or duty ( _provided, however,_ that the withholding
Party shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to make appropriate
substitute arrangements to permit reasonable disclosure not in violation of
any Law or duty), or (C) that is subject to any attorney-client, attorney work
product or other legal privilege ( _provided, however,_ that the withholding
Party shall use its reasonable best efforts to allow for such access or
disclosure to the maximum extent that does not result in a loss of any
such attorney-client, attorney work product or other legal privilege);
_provided, however,_ that such access and information shall be disclosed or
granted, as applicable, to external counsel for Parent to the extent
reasonably required for the purpose of complying with applicable Laws. Each of
the Company and Parent will use its commercially reasonable efforts to
minimize any disruption to the businesses of the other Party that may result
from the requests for access, data and information hereunder.

(b) Each of the Company and Parent will hold, and will cause
its Representatives and affiliates to hold, any non-public information,
including any information exchanged pursuant to this Section 7.1, in
confidence to the extent required by and in accordance with, and will
otherwise comply with, the terms of the Confidentiality Agreement.

(c) The Company shall give prompt notice to Parent, and Parent shall give
prompt notice to the Company, (i) of any notice or other communication
received by such Party from any Governmental Entity in connection with this
Agreement, the Offer, the Merger or other Transactions, or from any Person
alleging that the consent of such Person is or may be required in connection
with the Offer, the Merger or the other Transactions, if the subject matter of
such communication or the failure of such Party to obtain such consent could
be material to the Company, the Surviving Corporation or Parent, (ii) of any
legal proceeding commenced or, to any Partys knowledge, threatened against,
such Party or any of its Subsidiaries or affiliates or otherwise relating to,
involving or affecting such Party or any of its Subsidiaries or affiliates,
in each case in connection with, arising from or otherwise relating to the
Offer, the Merger or any other Transaction, and (iii) upon becoming aware of
the occurrence or impending occurrence of any event or circumstance relating
to it or any of the Company Subsidiaries or the Parent Subsidiaries,
respectively, which

 



58  would reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a
Company Material Adverse Effect or a Parent Material Adverse Effect, as the
case may be, or which would reasonably be expected to prevent or materially
delay or impede the consummation of the Transactions; _provided, however,_
that the delivery of any notice pursuant to this Section 7.1(c) shall not cure
any breach of any representation or warranty requiring disclosure of such
matter prior to the date of this Agreement or otherwise limit or affect the
remedies available hereunder to any Party. The failure to deliver any such
notice shall not affect any of the conditions set forth in Annex B or give
rise to any right to terminate under Article IX.

(d) Prior to the Closing, the Company shall use reasonable best efforts
to cause the Company Manager and each affiliate of the Company Manager to
deliver to the Company all Contracts and records in the Company Managers or
any of its affiliates possession or control to the extent (with respect to
Contracts) they are Contracts to which the Company or any Company Subsidiary
is a party, and with respect to records, to the extent they pertain to the
business of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries, _provided_ that, for the
avoidance of doubt, such records shall not include records that are the owned
property of the Company Manager and are not owned property of the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries.

 

(e) The Company shall give written notice to Parent as promptly as practicable
if at any time the Liquidity Ratio Test is not satisfied, and the Company
shall in good faith consider implementing the reasonable recommendations of
Parent with respect to maintaining adequate liquidity.

 

7.2 Reasonable Best Efforts.

 

(a) Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, each Party will use
its reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions and to
do, or cause to be done, all things necessary, proper or advisable under
applicable Laws to consummate the Offer, the Merger and the other Transactions
as soon as practicable after the date hereof, including (i) preparing and
filing or otherwise providing, in consultation with the other Party and as
promptly as practicable and advisable after the date hereof, all documentation
to effect all necessary applications, notices, petitions, filings, and other
documents and to obtain as promptly as practicable all waiting period
expirations or terminations, consents, clearances, waivers, licenses, orders,
registrations, approvals, permits, and authorizations necessary or advisable
to be obtained from any third party and/or any Governmental Entity and/or
Program Lender in order to consummate the Offer, the Merger or any of the
other Transactions and (ii) taking all steps as may be necessary, subject to
the limitations in this Section 7.2, to obtain all such waiting period
expirations or terminations, consents, clearances, waivers, licenses,
registrations, permits, authorizations, orders and approvals.

 

(b) In connection with and without limiting the foregoing, each of the Parties
shall give any notices to third parties, and each of the Parties shall use,
and cause each of their respective Subsidiaries and affiliates to use, its
reasonable best efforts to obtain any third party consents that are necessary,
proper or advisable to consummate the Offer and Merger. Each of the
Parties will furnish to the other such necessary information and reasonable
assistance as the other may request in connection with the preparation of any
required filings or submissions with any Governmental Entity or Program Lender
and will cooperate in responding to any inquiry from a Governmental Entity or
Program Lender, including promptly informing the other Parties of such
inquiry, consulting in advance before making any presentations or submissions
to a Governmental Entity or Program Lender, and supplying each other with
copies of all material correspondence,

 



59  filings or communications between either Party and any Governmental Entity
or Program Lender with respect to this Agreement. To the extent reasonably
practicable, the Parties or their Representatives shall have the right to
review in advance and each of the Parties will consult the others on, all the
information relating to the other and each of their affiliates that appears in
any filing made with, or written materials submitted to, any Governmental
Entity or Program Lender in connection with the Offer and the Merger and the
other Transactions, except that confidential competitively sensitive business
information may be redacted from such exchanges. To the extent
reasonably practicable, none of the Parties shall, nor shall they permit
their respective Representatives to, participate independently in any meeting
or engage in any substantive conversation with any Governmental Entity or
Program Lender in respect of any filing, investigation or other inquiry
without giving the other Party prior notice of such meeting or conversation
and, to the extent permitted by applicable Law, without giving the other
Parties the opportunity to attend or participate (whether by telephone or in

(c) In connection with obtaining any approval or consent from any Person with
respect to the Offer or the Merger, the Company or any Company Subsidiary
shall not pay or commit to pay to any Person whose approval or consent is
being solicited any cash or other consideration, make any accommodation or

the prior written consent of Parent. The Parties shall cooperate to obtain
such consents.

 

(d) For the avoidance of doubt, the Parties agree that no transfer of any
interest in any project of the Company or any its Subsidiaries under this
Agreement shall be effective prior to obtaining any applicable Required
Consents of HUD. Prior to obtaining any such Required Consents of HUD, (i)
Parent and its Subsidiaries will not take possession of any such project nor
assume benefits of any such project ownership prior to such approval by HUD
and (ii) Parent and its assigns will have no right upon any breach by the
Company hereunder to seek damages, directly or indirectly, from the applicable
project to which the HUD approval relates, including from any assets, rents,
issues or profits thereof, and shall have no right to effect a lien upon such
projects or the assets, rents, issues, or profits thereof.

 

7.3 Publicity. So long as this Agreement is in effect, none of the Company,
the Company Subsidiaries, Parent, the Parent Subsidiaries or the manager of
Parent shall issue or cause the publication of any press release or other
public announcement with respect to the Offer, the Merger or this Agreement
without the prior written consent of the other Party, unless such Party
determines, after consultation with outside counsel, that it is required by
applicable Law or by any listing agreement with or the listing rules of a
national securities exchange or trading market to issue or cause the
publication of any press release or other public announcement with respect to
the Offer, the Merger or this Agreement, in which event such Party shall
endeavor, on a basis reasonable under the circumstances, to provide a
meaningful opportunity to the other Party to review and comment upon such
press release or other announcement in advance and shall give due
consideration to all reasonable additions, deletions or changes suggested
thereto; _provided, however,_ that the Parties shall not be required by
this Section 7.3 to provide any such review or comment to the other Party
relating to any dispute between the Parties relating to this Agreement;
provided, further, that each Party and their respective affiliates and
Representatives may make statements that are not inconsistent with previous
press releases, public disclosures or public statements made by Parent or the
Company in compliance with this Section 7.3; and _provided_ , _further_ , that
none of the limitations set forth in this Section 7.3 shall apply in
connection with or following a Change of Recommendation.

 



60 7.4 DandO Insurance and Indemnification.

 

(a) For not less than six (6) years from and after the Effective Time, Parent
shall and shall cause the Surviving Corporation to indemnify and hold
harmless all past and present directors, officers and agents of the Company
and the Company Subsidiaries (collectively, the " _Indemnified Parties_ ")
against any costs or expenses (including advancing attorneys fees and
expenses in advance of the final disposition of any actual or threatened
claim, suit, proceeding or investigation to each Indemnified Party to the
extent permitted by applicable Law; provided such Indemnified Party agrees
in advance to return any such funds to which a court of competent
jurisdiction has determined in a final, nonappealable judgment such
Indemnified Party is not ultimately entitled), judgments, fines, losses,
claims, damages, liabilities and amounts paid in settlement in connection
with any actual or threatened claim, action, investigation, suit or proceeding
in respect of acts or omissions occurring or alleged to have occurred at or
prior to the Effective Time, whether asserted or claimed prior to, at or
after the Effective Time (including acts or omissions occurring in connection
with the approval of this Agreement and the consummation of the Offer, the
Merger or any of the other Transactions), in connection with such Persons
serving as an officer, director, employee, agent or fiduciary of the Company
or any of the Company Subsidiaries or of any Person if such service was at the
request or for the benefit of the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries,
to the extent permitted by Law and provided pursuant to the Company Governing
Documents or the organizational documents of any Company Subsidiary or any
indemnification agreements, if any, in existence on the date of this Agreement
and which were provided to Parent prior to the date hereof (including the
Management Agreement). Without limiting or being limited by the foregoing, the
Parties agree that all rights to elimination of liability, indemnification and
advancement of expenses for acts or omissions occurring or alleged to have
occurred at or prior to the Effective Time, whether asserted or claimed prior
to, at or after the Effective Time, now existing in favor of the Indemnified
Parties as provided in their respective charter or bylaws (or
comparable organizational documents) or in any agreement (including the
Management Agreement) shall survive the Merger and shall continue in full
force and effect in accordance with the terms thereof. Notwithstanding
anything herein to the contrary, if any Indemnified Party notifies Parent on
or prior to the sixth (6th) anniversary of the Effective Time of a matter in
respect of which such Person may seek indemnification pursuant to this Section
7.4, the provisions of this Section 7.4 shall continue in effect with respect
to such matter until the final disposition of all claims, actions,
investigations, suits and proceedings relating thereto.

 

(b) For six (6) years after the Effective Time, Parent and the Surviving
Corporation shall cause to be maintained in effect the provisions in (i) the
Company Governing Documents and the organizational documents of any Company
Subsidiary and (ii) except to the extent such agreement provides for an
earlier termination, any other agreements of the Company and the Company
Subsidiaries with any Indemnified Party, in each case, regarding elimination
of liability, indemnification of officers, directors, agents and employees and
advancement of expenses that are in existence on the date of this Agreement,
copies of all of which have been provided to Parent prior to the date hereof
(including the Management Agreement), and no such provision shall be amended,
modified or repealed in any manner that would adversely affect the rights or
protections thereunder of any such Indemnified Party in respect of acts or
omissions occurring or alleged to have occurred at or prior to the Effective
Time (including acts or omissions occurring in connection with the approval of
this Agreement and the consummation of the Offer, the Merger or any of the
other Transactions).

 



61 (c) At or prior to the Acceptance Time, in consultation with Parent as
provided in this Section 7.4(c), the Company shall purchase a six (6)-year
prepaid "tail" policy on terms and conditions providing coverage retentions,
limits and other material terms substantially equivalent to the current
policies of directors and officers liability insurance and fiduciary
liability insurance maintained by the Company and the Company Subsidiaries
with respect to matters arising on or before the Effective Time, covering
without limitation the transactions contemplated hereby; _provided, however,_
that the Company shall, in cooperation with Parent, use commercially
reasonably efforts to obtain the most favorable pricing and most comprehensive
coverage reasonably available for such "tail" policy and the Company shall
not commit or spend on such "tail" policy more than 300% of the last aggregate
annual premium paid by the Company prior to the date hereof for the Companys
current policies of directors and officers liability insurance and
fiduciary liability insurance (the " _Base Amount_ "), and if the cost of such
"tail" policy would otherwise exceed the Base Amount, the Company shall
be permitted to purchase as much coverage as reasonably practicable for the
Base Amount. After the Effective Time, Parent shall cause such policy to be
maintained in full force and effect, for its full term, and cause all
obligations thereunder to be honored by the Surviving Corporation, and no
Party shall have any other obligation to purchase or pay for insurance
hereunder. The Company shall in good faith cooperate and consult with Parent
prior to the Acceptance Time with respect to the procurement of such "tail"
policy, including with respect to the selection of the broker, available
policy price and coverage options, and shall in good faith consider Parents
recommendations with respect thereto.

 

(d) In the event Parent or the Surviving Corporation or any of their
respective successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any
other Person and shall not be the continuing or surviving corporation or
entity of such consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers all or substantially
all of its properties and assets to any Person, then, and in each such
case, proper provision shall be made so that the successors and assigns of
Parent or the Surviving Corporation, as the case may be, shall assume the
obligations set forth in this Section 7.4. The rights and obligations under
this Section 7.4 shall survive consummation of the Offer and the Merger and
shall not be terminated or amended in a manner that is adverse to any
Indemnified Party without the written consent of such Indemnified Party. The
Parties acknowledge and agree that the Indemnified Parties shall be third
party beneficiaries of this Section 7.4, each of whom may enforce the
provisions thereof.

7.5 Takeover Statutes. The Parties shall use their respective reasonable best
efforts (a) to take all action necessary so that no Takeover Statute is or
becomes applicable to the Offer, the Merger or any of the other Transactions
and (b) if any such Takeover Statute is or becomes applicable to any of the
foregoing, to take all action necessary so that the Offer, the Merger and the
other Transactions may be consummated as promptly as practicable on the terms
contemplated by this Agreement or otherwise to eliminate or minimize the
effect of such Takeover Statute on the Offer, the Merger and the other
Transactions. No Change of Recommendation shall change, or be deemed to
change, the approval of the Company Board of Directors for purposes of
causing any Takeover Statute to be inapplicable to the Offer, the Merger or
any of the other Transactions.

 

7.6 Obligations of Purchaser. Parent shall take all action necessary to cause
Purchaser to perform its obligations under this Agreement and to consummate
the Transactions, including the Offer and the Merger, upon the terms and
subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement.

 



62 7.7 Rule 16b-3. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company and Parent shall,
as applicable, take all such steps as may be reasonably necessary or
advisable hereto to cause any dispositions of Company equity securities
(including derivative securities) and acquisitions of Parent equity securities
pursuant to the Transactions contemplated by this Agreement by each
individual who is a director or officer of the Company subject to the
reporting requirements of Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act with respect to
the Company to be exempt under Rule 16b-3 promulgated under the Exchange Act.
Upon request, the Company shall promptly furnish Parent with all requisite
information for Parent to take the actions contemplated by this Section 7.7.

 

7.8 Security Holder Litigation. Each Party shall provide the other Party
prompt notice of any litigation brought by any stockholder of that Party
against such Party, any of its Subsidiaries and/or any of their respective
directors relating to the Offer, the Merger, this Agreement or any of the
other Transactions, and shall keep the other Party informed on a prompt and
timely basis with respect to the status thereof. The Company shall give Parent
the opportunity to participate (at Parents expense and subject to a customary
joint defense agreement) in the defense or settlement of any such litigation,
the Company shall reasonably cooperate with Parent conducting the defense or
settlement of such litigation, and no such settlement shall be agreed to
without Parents prior written consent, which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed, except that Parent shall not
be obligated to consent to any settlement which does not include a full
release of Parent and its affiliates or which imposes an injunction or other
equitable relief after the Effective Time upon Parent or any of its
affiliates. In the event of, and to the extent of, any conflict or overlap
between the provisions of this Section 7.8 and Section 6.1 or Section 7.2, the
provisions of this Section 7.8 shall control.

 

7.9 Delisting. Each of the Parties agrees to cooperate with the other Parties
in taking, or causing to be taken, all actions necessary to delist each of
the Company Common Stock and Company Preferred Stock from NASDAQ and terminate
its registration under the Exchange Act; provided that such delisting and
termination shall not be effective until after the Effective Time. 

7.10 Director Resignations. The Company shall cause to be delivered to Parent
resignations executed by each director of the Company in office as of
immediately prior to the Effective Time and effective upon the Effective Time.

7.11 Certain Tax Matters.

(a) Each of the Parties shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause the
Offer and the Merger, taken together, to qualify as a "reorganization" within
the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code, including by executing and

Merger contained or set forth in the Form S-4 or (ii) the tax opinions
referenced in clauses (E)(5)(i) and (E)(5)(ii) of Annex B. None of the Parties
shall (and each of the Parties shall cause their respective Subsidiaries not

be expected to cause the Offer and the Merger, taken together, to fail to
qualify as a "reorganization" within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the
Code. The Parties intend to report and, except to the extent otherwise
required pursuant to a "final determination" within the meaning of Section
1313(a) of the Code (or any similar provision of state, local or foreign Law),

granted according to employment compensation, severance and other employee
benefit plans of the Company, including the Company Benefit Plans

and holders of Company RSUs. The Compensation and Governance Committee of the
Company Board of Directors (the " _Company Compensation Committee_ ") (A) at
a meeting held or to be held prior to the Acceptance Time, has duly adopted or
will duly adopt resolutions approving as an "employment compensation,
severance or other employee benefit arrangement" within the meaning of

director" in accordance with the requirements of Rule 14d-10(d)(2) under the
Exchange Act.

 

7.14 Treatment of Management Agreement. On the date hereof, the Company, MTGE
TRS, LLC and the Company Manager have entered into an amendment to the

_Termination Amendment_ "), and such termination shall be without any
liability (except to the extent specifically set forth therein) to the
Company, any of the Company Subsidiaries, Parent, any affiliate of Parent, or
the Surviving Corporation. The Company has provided to Parent a true, correct
and complete copy of the executed Termination Amendment. The Company shall not

(i) the replacement, backstopping or amendment, as of the Effective Time, of
outstanding financial guaranties, letters of credit, letters of guaranty,
surety bonds and other similar instruments and obligations of the Company and
the Company Subsidiaries, including granting any waivers in respect thereof
and facilitating the migration of such financial products to the facilities

after the Closing Parent and/or its Subsidiaries may amend, modify
or otherwise alter each such severance agreement in accordance with its
terms.

 



65 (b) On and after the Closing Date, (i) Parent shall ensure, or cause the
Surviving Corporation or a Subsidiary thereof to ensure, that no limitations
or exclusions as to pre-existing conditions, evidence of insurability or good
health, waiting periods or actively-at-work exclusions or other limitations or

Employees_ ") or their dependents or beneficiaries under any welfare benefit
plans sponsored by Parent and its Subsidiaries (" _Parent Plans_ ") in which
such Continuing Employees or their dependents or beneficiaries first become
eligible to participate after the Effective Time, except to the extent such
exclusions, limitations or restrictions would apply under the analogous
Company Benefit Plan in which any such Continuing Employee was a participant
or was eligible to participate immediately prior to the Effective Time and
(ii) any costs or expenses incurred by Continuing Employees (and their
dependents or beneficiaries) up to (and including) the Closing Date shall be
taken into account for purposes of satisfying applicable deductible, co-
payment, coinsurance, maximum out-of-pocket provisions and like adjustments or
limitations on coverage under any such Parent Plans for the plan year in which
the Closing Date occurs, except to the extent such costs or expenses would
not be taken into account for such purposes under the analogous Company
Benefit Plan in which any such Continuing Employee was a participant or was
eligible to participate immediately prior to the Effective Time.

(c) With respect to each employee benefit plan, policy or practice, including
severance, vacation and paid time off plans, policies or practices, sponsored
or maintained by Parent or its Affiliates (including the Surviving Corporation
following the Closing) in which the Continuing Employees become eligible to
participate after the Effective Time, Parent shall grant, or cause to be
granted to, all Continuing Employees from and after the Closing Date credit
for all service with the Company, its Affiliates and their predecessors prior
to the Closing Date for purposes of eligibility to participate, vesting
credit, eligibility to commence benefits, and benefit accrual, but excluding
(i) benefit accrual under any defined benefit pension plan or retiree medical
program and (ii) any such credit that would result in a duplication of
benefits.

(d) Nothing contained in this Section 7.16 or any other provision of this
Agreement, express or implied: (i) shall be construed to establish, amend, or
modify any benefit plan, program, agreement or arrangement, including any
Company Benefit Plan or any employee benefit plan of Parent or any of its
Subsidiaries, (ii) shall alter or limit the ability of any of Parent, the
Surviving Corporation, or any of their respective Subsidiaries to amend,
modify or terminate any benefit plan, program, agreement or arrangement at any
time assumed, established, sponsored or maintained by any of them, (iii) is
intended to confer upon any current or former employee any right to employment
or continued employment for any period of time by reason of this Agreement, or
any right to a particular term or condition of employment, or (iv) is
intended to confer upon any Person (including for the avoidance of doubt any
current or former employee, director, officer or other service provider or any

pay a fee of $35,118,500.00 in cash (the " _Termination Fee_ ") to Parent.
Solely for purposes of this Section 9.2(b)(i), the term " _Acquisition
Proposal_ " shall have the meaning assigned to such term in Annex A, except
that all references to "20%" and "80%" therein shall be deemed to be
references to "50%."

(ii) If Parent terminates this Agreement pursuant to Section 9.1(e), within
two (2) business days after such termination, the Company shall pay or cause
to be paid to Parent the Termination Fee.

(iii) If the Company terminates this Agreement pursuant to Section 9.1(g),
immediately prior to such termination, the Company shall pay or cause to be
paid to Parent the Termination Fee.

 

(iv) For the avoidance of doubt, in no event shall the Company be obligated to
pay the Termination Fee on more than one occasion.

 

(c) Any payment required to be made under this _Section 9.2_ shall be made by
wire transfer of same-day funds to the account or accounts designated by
Parent.

(d) Each of the Parties acknowledges that the agreements contained in this
Section 9.2 are an integral part of the Transactions and that the Termination
Fee is not a penalty, but rather is a reasonable amount that will compensate
Parent and Purchaser in the circumstances in which the Termination Fee is
payable for the efforts and resources expended and opportunities foregone
while negotiating this Agreement and in reliance on this Agreement and on the
expectation of the consummation of the Transactions. In addition, if the
Company fails to pay in a timely manner any amount due pursuant to Section
9.2(b), then (i) the Company shall reimburse Parent for all costs and expenses
(including disbursements and fees of counsel) incurred in the collection of
such overdue amount, including in connection with any related claims, actions
or proceedings commenced and (ii) the Company shall pay to Parent interest on
the amounts payable pursuant to Section 9.2(b) from and including the date
payment of such amount or amounts were due to but excluding the date of
actual payment at the prime rate set forth in The Wall Street Journal in
effect on the date such payment was required to be made. Other than for
Willful Breach, payment of the Termination Fee (and any additional amounts
required under this Section 9.2(d)) to Parent by the Company in accordance
with this Agreement shall be the sole and exclusive remedy of Parent and shall
be deemed to be liquidated damages for any actual or purported breach of this
Agreement and for any and all losses or damages suffered or incurred by
Parent or any of its Affiliates in connection with this Agreement (and the
termination hereof), the transactions contemplated hereby (and the abandonment
thereof) or any matter forming the basis for such termination and, after such
payment has been made, the Company and its Affiliates shall have no further
liability for any such actual or purported breach or for any and all losses or
damages suffered or incurred by Parent or any of its Affiliates in connection
with this Agreement (and the termination hereof), the transactions
contemplated hereby (and the abandonment thereof) or any matter forming the
basis for such termination.

meaning set forth in Rule 12b-2 of the Exchange Act. The table of contents and

10.6 Counterparts. This Agreement may be executed manually or by facsimile or

each of the Parties and delivered to the other Parties. The exchange of a
fully executed Agreement (in counterparts or otherwise) by electronic
transmission in .PDF format or by facsimile shall be sufficient to bind the
Parties to the terms and conditions of this Agreement.

 



71 10.7 Entire Agreement Third-Party Beneficiaries.

 

(a) This Agreement (including the Company Disclosure Letter and the Parent

agreement among the Parties with respect to the subject matter hereof and
thereof and supersede all other prior agreements (except that the
Confidentiality Agreement shall be deemed amended hereby so that until the

Agreement) and understandings, both written and oral, among the Parties or any
of them with respect to the subject matter hereof and thereof.

10.8 Severability. If any term or other provision of this Agreement is

policy, all other conditions and provisions of this Agreement shall
nevertheless remain in full force and effect so long as the economic or legal
substance of the Offer and the Merger is not affected in any manner adverse
to any Party. Upon such determination that any term or other provision is
invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced, the Parties shall negotiate
in good faith to modify this Agreement so as to effect the original intent of
the Parties as closely as possible in an acceptable manner to the end that
the Offer and the Merger are fulfilled to the extent possible.

 

10.9 Governing Law; Jurisdiction.

for recognition or enforcement of any judgment relating thereto, and each of
the Parties hereby irrevocably and unconditionally (i) agrees not to commence
any such action or proceeding except in the MD Courts, (ii) agrees that any
claim in respect of any such action or proceeding may be heard and determined
in the MD Courts, (iii) waives, to the fullest extent it may legally and
effectively do so, any objection that it may now or hereafter have to the
laying of venue of any such action or proceeding in such courts, and (iv)
waives, to the fullest extent permitted by Law, the defense of an inconvenient
forum to the maintenance of such action or proceeding in such courts. In the
event that any action or proceeding described in the preceding sentence is
pending in the Circuit Court for Baltimore City, Maryland, each of the Parties
shall cooperate in seeking to have the action or proceeding assigned to the
Business and Technology Case Management Program. Each of the Parties hereto
agrees that a final judgment in any such action or proceeding shall be
conclusive

 



72  and may be enforced in other jurisdictions by suit on the judgment or in any
other manner provided by Law. Each Party to this Agreement irrevocably
consents to service of process inside or outside the territorial jurisdiction
of the courts referred to in this Section 10.9(b) in the manner provided for
notices in Section 10.4. Nothing in this Agreement will affect the right of
any Party to this Agreement to serve process in any other manner permitted by
Law.

10.10 Waiver of Jury Trial. EACH PARTY HEREBY IRREVOCABLY AND UNCONDITIONALLY
WAIVES ANY RIGHT IT MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN RESPECT OF ANY LITIGATION
DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT AND ANY OF
THE AGREEMENTS DELIVERED IN CONNECTION HEREWITH OR THE OFFER, THE MERGER AND
OTHER TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY OR THEREBY. EACH PARTY CERTIFIES AND
ACKNOWLEDGES THAT (A) NO REPRESENTATIVE, AGENT OR ATTORNEY OF ANY OTHER PARTY
HAS REPRESENTED, EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE, THAT SUCH OTHER PARTY WOULD NOT, IN
THE EVENT OF LITIGATION, SEEK TO ENFORCE SUCH WAIVERS, (B) IT UNDERSTANDS AND
HAS CONSIDERED THE IMPLICATIONS OF SUCH WAIVERS, (C) IT MAKES SUCH WAIVERS
VOLUNTARILY, AND (D) IT HAS BEEN INDUCED TO ENTER INTO THIS AGREEMENT BY,
AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE MUTUAL WAIVERS AND CERTIFICATIONS IN THIS SECTION
10.10.

10.11 Assignment. This Agreement shall not be assigned by any of the Parties
(whether by operation of Law or otherwise) without the prior written consent
of the other Parties other than by virtue of the consummation of the
Transactions. Subject to the preceding sentence, but without relieving any
Party of any obligation hereunder, this Agreement will be binding upon, inure
to the benefit of and be enforceable by the Parties and their respective
successors and assigns.

 

10.12 Enforcement; Remedies.

 

(a) Except as otherwise expressly provided herein, any and all remedies herein
expressly conferred upon a Party will be deemed cumulative with and not
exclusive of any other remedy conferred hereby, or by Law or equity upon such
Party, and the exercise by a Party of any one remedy will not preclude the
exercise of any other remedy.

 

(b) The Parties agree that irreparable injury will occur in the event that any
of the provisions of this Agreement is not performed in accordance with its
specific terms or is otherwise breached. It is agreed that prior to the valid
termination of this Agreement pursuant to Article IX, each Party shall be
entitled to an injunction or injunctions to prevent or remedy any breaches
or threatened breaches of this Agreement by any other Party, to a decree or
order of specific performance specifically enforce the terms and provisions of
this Agreement and to any further equitable relief.

 

(c) The Parties rights in this Section 10.12 are an integral part of the
Transactions and each Party hereby waives any objections to any remedy
referred to in this Section 10.12 (including any objection on the basis that
there is an adequate remedy at Law or that an award of such remedy is not an
appropriate remedy for any reason at Law or equity). For the avoidance of
doubt, each Party agrees that there is not an adequate remedy at Law for a
breach of this Agreement by any Party. In the event any Party seeks any remedy
referred to in this Section 10.12, such Party shall not be required
to obtain, furnish, post or provide any bond or other security in connection
with or as a condition to obtaining any such remedy.

8.125% SERIES H CUMULATIVE REDEEMABLE PREFERRED STOCK

($25.00 LIQUIDATION PREFERENCE PER SHARE)

 

OF

ANNALY CAPITAL MANAGEMENT, INC.

Annaly Capital Management, Inc., a Maryland corporation (the " _Corporation_
"), does hereby certify to the State Department of Assessments and Taxation
of Maryland that:

_FIRST_ : Under a power contained in Article VI of the charter of the
Corporation (the " _Charter_ "), the Board of Directors of the Corporation
(the " _Board_ ") by duly adopted resolutions that reclassified not more than
2,200,000 shares of authorized but unissued Common Stock (as defined in the
Charter) as shares of preferred stock of the Corporation, par value $0.01 per
share, and designated such shares as "Series H Cumulative Redeemable Preferred
Stock" with the following preferences, rights, voting powers, restrictions,
limitations as to dividends and other distributions, qualifications, terms and
conditions of redemption, which, upon any restatement of the Charter, shall
become part of Article VI of the Charter, with any necessary or
appropriate renumbering or relettering of the sections or subsections
thereof:

Section 1\. _Designation and Amount_. A series of Preferred Stock, designated
the 8.125% Series H Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Stock, par value $0.01 per
share (the " _Series H Preferred Stock_ "), is hereby established. The number
of shares of Series H Preferred Stock initially shall be 2,200,000.

Section 2. _Maturity_. The Series H Preferred Stock has no stated maturity
and will not be subject to any sinking fund or mandatory redemption, and will
remain outstanding indefinitely unless (i) the Corporation decides to redeem
or otherwise repurchase the Series H Preferred Stock or (ii) the Series H
Preferred Stock becomes convertible and is actually converted pursuant to
Section 7 hereof. The Corporation is not required to set aside funds to redeem
the Series H Preferred Stock.

 

Section 3. _Ranking_. The Series H Preferred Stock will rank, with respect to
rights to the payment of dividends and the distribution of assets in the
event of any liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Corporation, (i)
senior to all classes or series of the Corporations common stock, par value
$0.01 per share (the " _Common Stock_ "), and to all other equity securities
issued by the Corporation other than equity securities referred to in clauses
(ii) and (iii) of this Section 3; (ii) on a parity with the Corporations
7.625% Series C Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Stock, 7.50% Series D
Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Stock, 6.95% Series F Fixed-to-Floating Rate
Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Stock, 6.50% Series G Fixed-to-Floating Rate
Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Stock, and with all other equity securities
issued by the Corporation with terms specifically providing that those equity
securities rank on a parity with the Series H Preferred Stock with respect to
rights to the payment of dividends and the distribution of assets upon any
liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Corporation; and (iii) junior
to   all equity securities issued by the Corporation with terms specifically
providing that those equity securities rank senior to the Series H Preferred
Stock with respect to rights to the payment of dividends and the distribution
of assets upon any liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Corporation.
The term "equity securities" shall not include convertible debt securities.

 

Section 4. _Dividends_.

 

(a) Subject to the preferential rights of the holders of any class or series
of capital stock of the Corporation ranking senior to the Series H Preferred
Stock as to dividends, holders of shares of the Series H Preferred Stock shall
be entitled to receive, when, as and if authorized by the Board and declared
by the Corporation, out of funds of the Corporation legally available for the
payment of dividends, cumulative cash dividends at the rate of 8.125% per
annum of the $25.00 liquidation preference per share of Series H Preferred
Stock (equivalent to $2.03125 per annum per share). Such dividends with
respect to each share of Series H Preferred Stock shall accumulate daily and
shall be cumulative from, and including, [●]1, and shall be payable quarterly
in arrears on March 31, June 30, September 30 and December 31 (each, a "
_Dividend Payment Date_ "), commencing on [ _next payment date of Annaly
preferred after merger closing_ ]; _provided_ , that if any Dividend Payment
Date is not a Business Day (as defined below), then the dividend which would
otherwise have been payable on that Dividend Payment Date may be paid on
either the immediately preceding Business Day or the next succeeding Business
Day with the same force and effect as if paid on such Dividend Payment Date
and no interest, additional dividends or other sums will accrue on the amount
so payable for the period from and after such Dividend Payment Date to such
next succeeding Business Day. Any dividend payable on the Series H
Preferred Stock, including dividends payable for any partial dividend period,
will be computed on the basis of a 360-day year consisting of twelve 30-day
months. Dividends will be payable to holders of record as they appear in the
stock records of the Corporation for the Series H Preferred Stock at the close
of business on the applicable record date, which shall be the first day of the
calendar month, whether or not a Business Day, in which the applicable
Dividend Payment Date falls or on such record date set by the Board, not more
than 30 days preceding the applicable Dividend Payment Date (each, a "
_Dividend Record Date_ "). The dividends payable on any Dividend Payment Date
shall include dividends accumulated to, but not including, such Dividend
Payment Date.

 

(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in Section 4(a), if,
following a Change of Control (as hereinafter defined), the Corporation has
not exercised its option to redeem the Series H Preferred Stock pursuant to
Section 6, the quarterly cumulative dividend rate shall be increased by three
hundred (300) basis points per annum (such increased dividend rate, the "
_Special Dividend Rate_ "). Holders of shares of the Series H Preferred Stock
will be entitled to receive, when, as and if authorized by the Board and
declared by the Corporation, out of funds of the Corporation
legally available for the payment of dividends, cumulative cash dividends
from, and including, the first date on which the Change of Control has
occurred at the Special Dividend Rate for so long as the Corporation has not
exercised its option to redeem the Series H Preferred Stock pursuant to
Section 6\.



   1  | NTD: Date expected to be April 1 or July 1. If Mountain has not
declared the July 15 dividend by the time of the closing, accrual will begin
on the first day of the first month of the second quarter (April 1), and
payment dates will be the same as Annalys payment dates (i.e., second quarter
dividend to be paid on June 30). If Mountain has declared the July 15 dividend
and closing occurs prior to the payment date (i.e., closing occurs between
June 16 and July 15), Annaly will assume the second quarter dividend payment
obligation (i.e., second quarter dividend to be paid on July 15) and accrual
for the third quarter will begin on the first day of the first month of
the quarter (July 1), and future payment dates will be the same as Annalys
payment dates. If closing occurs after July 15 and Mountain has not declared
the third quarter dividend (i.e., closing occurs between July 16 and mid-
September), accrual will begin on the first day of the first month of the
third quarter (July 1), and payment dates will be the same as Annalys payment
dates (i.e., third quarter dividend to be paid on September 30). 
---|--- 
 



-2- (c) No dividends on shares of Series H Preferred Stock shall be authorized by
the Board or paid or set apart for payment by the Corporation at any time
when the terms and provisions of any agreement of the Corporation, including
any agreement relating to any indebtedness of the Corporation, prohibit the
authorization, payment or setting apart for payment thereof or provide that
the authorization, payment or setting apart for payment thereof would
constitute a breach of the agreement or a default under the agreement, or if
the authorization, payment or setting apart for payment shall be restricted
or prohibited by law.

(d) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, dividends on
the Series H Preferred Stock will accumulate whether or not the Corporation
has earnings, whether or not there are funds legally available for the payment
of those dividends and whether or not those dividends are declared. No
interest, or sum in lieu of interest, will be payable in respect of any
dividend payment or payments on the Series H Preferred Stock which may be in
arrears, and holders of the Series H Preferred Stock will not be entitled to
any dividends in excess of full cumulative dividends described in Sections
4(a) and (b). Any dividend payment made on the Series H Preferred Stock shall
first be credited against the earliest accumulated but unpaid dividend due
with respect to the Series H Preferred Stock.

 

(e) Except as provided in Section 4(f), unless full cumulative dividends on
the Series H Preferred Stock have been or contemporaneously are declared and
paid or declared and a sum sufficient for the payment thereof is set apart for
payment for all past dividend periods, (i) no dividends (other than in shares
of Common Stock or in shares of any class or series of Preferred Stock that
the Corporation may issue ranking junior to the Series H Preferred Stock as to
dividends and upon liquidation) shall be declared or paid or set aside for
payment upon shares of Common Stock or Preferred Stock that the Corporation
may issue ranking junior to or on a parity with the Series H Preferred Stock
as to dividends or upon liquidation, (ii) no other distribution shall be
declared or made upon shares of Common Stock or Preferred Stock that
the Corporation may issue ranking junior to or on a parity with the Series H
Preferred Stock as to dividends or upon liquidation, and (iii) any shares of
Common Stock and Preferred Stock that the Corporation may issue ranking junior
to or on a parity with the Series H Preferred Stock as to dividends or upon
liquidation shall not be redeemed, purchased or otherwise acquired for any
consideration (or any moneys be paid to or made available for a sinking fund
for the redemption of any such shares) by the Corporation (except (x) by
conversion into or exchange for other capital stock of the Corporation that it
may issue ranking junior to the Series H Preferred Stock as to dividends and
upon liquidation, and (y) for transfers made pursuant to the provisions of
Article XI of the Charter).

(f) When dividends are not paid in full (or a sum sufficient for such full
payment is not so set apart) upon the Series H Preferred Stock and the shares
of any other class or series of Preferred Stock that the Corporation may issue
ranking on a parity as to dividends with the Series H Preferred Stock,
all dividends declared upon the Series H Preferred Stock and any other class
or series of Preferred Stock that the Corporation may issue ranking on a
parity as to dividends with the Series H Preferred Stock shall be declared
_pro rata_ so that the amount of dividends declared per share of Series H
Preferred Stock and such other class or series of Preferred Stock that the
Corporation may issue shall in all cases bear to each other the same ratio
that accumulated dividends per share on the Series H Preferred Stock and
accumulated or accrued dividends per share on such other class or series of
Preferred Stock that the Corporation may issue (which shall not include any
accrual in respect of unpaid dividends for prior dividend periods if such
Preferred Stock does not have a cumulative dividend) bear to each other. No
interest, or sum of money in lieu of interest, shall be payable in respect of
any dividend payment or payments on the Series H Preferred Stock which may be
in arrears. 

 



-3- (g) " _Business Day_ " shall mean any day, other than a Saturday or
Sunday, that is neither a legal holiday nor a day on which banking
institutions in the State of Maryland are authorized or required by law,
regulation or executive order to close.

 

Section 5. _Liquidation Preference_.

 

(a) In the event of any voluntary or involuntary liquidation, dissolution or
winding up of the Corporation, the holders of shares of Series H Preferred
Stock will be entitled to be paid out of the assets the Corporation has
legally available for distribution to its stockholders, subject to the
preferential rights of the holders of any class or series of capital stock of
the Corporation it may issue ranking senior to the Series H Preferred Stock
with respect to the distribution of assets upon liquidation, dissolution or
winding up, a liquidation preference of Twenty-Five Dollars ($25.00) per
share, plus an amount equal to any accumulated and unpaid dividends to, but
not including, the date of payment, before any distribution of assets is made
to holders of Common Stock or any other class or series of capital stock of
the Corporation that it may issue that ranks junior to the Series H Preferred
Stock as to liquidation rights.

(b) In the event that, upon any such voluntary or involuntary liquidation,
dissolution or winding up, the available assets of the Corporation are
insufficient to pay the amount of the liquidating distributions on all
outstanding shares of Series H Preferred Stock and the corresponding amounts
payable on all shares of other classes or series of capital stock of the
Corporation that it may issue ranking on a parity with the Series H Preferred
Stock in the distribution of assets, then the holders of the Series H
Preferred Stock and all other such classes or series of capital stock shall
share ratably in any such distribution of assets in proportion to the full
liquidating distributions to which they would otherwise be respectively
entitled.

 

(c) Holders of Series H Preferred Stock will be entitled to written notice of
any such liquidation no fewer than 30 days and no more than 60 days prior to
the payment date. After payment of the full amount of the liquidating
distributions to which they are entitled, the holders of Series H Preferred
Stock will have no right or claim to any of the remaining assets of
the Corporation. The consolidation or merger of the Corporation, or a
statutory share exchange, with or into any other corporation, trust or entity
or of any other entity with or into the Corporation, or the sale, lease,
transfer or conveyance of all or substantially all of the property or
business the Corporation, shall not be deemed to constitute a liquidation,
dissolution or winding up of the Corporation.

 

Section 6. _Redemption_.

 

(a) The Series H Preferred Stock is not redeemable prior to May 22, 2019
except as described in this Section 6 and except that, as provided in Article
XI of the Charter, the Corporation may purchase or redeem shares of the Series
H Preferred Stock prior to that date in order to preserve its qualification as
a real estate investment trust (" _REIT_ ") for federal income tax purposes.

 



-4- (b) _Optional Redemption Right_. On and after May 22, 2019, the Corporation
may, at its option, upon not less than 30 nor more than 60 days written
notice, redeem the Series H Preferred Stock, in whole or in part, at any time
or from time to time, for cash at a redemption price of Twenty-Five Dollars
($25.00) per share, plus any accumulated and unpaid dividends thereon to, but
not including, the date fixed for redemption. If the Corporation elects to
redeem any shares of Series H Preferred Stock as described in this Section
6(b), it may use any available cash to pay the redemption price, and it will
not be required to pay the redemption price only out of the proceeds from the
issuance of other equity securities or any other specific source.

 

(c) _Special Optional Redemption Right_. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary contained in Section 6(a), upon the occurrence of a Change of
Control, the Corporation may, at its option, upon not less than 30 nor more
than 60 days written notice, redeem the Series H Preferred Stock, in whole or
in part, within 120 days after the first date on which such Change of Control
occurred, for cash at a redemption price of Twenty-Five Dollars ($25.00) per
share, plus any accumulated and unpaid dividends thereon to, but not
including, the date fixed for redemption. If, prior to the Change of
Control Conversion Date (as hereinafter defined), the Corporation has
provided notice of its election to redeem some or all of the shares of Series
H Preferred Stock pursuant to this Section 6, the holders of Series H
Preferred Stock will not have the Change of Control Conversion Right (as
hereinafter defined) with respect to the shares called for redemption. If the
Corporation elects to redeem any shares of Series H Preferred Stock as
described in this Section 6(c), it may use any available cash to pay the
redemption price, and it will not be required to pay the redemption price only
out of the proceeds from the issuance of other equity securities or any other
specific source.

 

(d) A " _Change of Control_ " is deemed to occur when, after the Original
Issue Date, the following have occurred and are continuing: (i) the
acquisition by any person, including any syndicate or group deemed to be a
"person" under Section 13(d)(3) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as
amended (the " _Exchange Act_ "), of beneficial ownership, directly or
indirectly, through a purchase, merger or other acquisition transaction or
series of purchases, mergers or other acquisition transactions of capital
stock of the Corporation entitling that person to exercise more than 50% of
the total voting power of all capital stock of the Corporation entitled to
vote generally in the election of directors of the Corporation (except that
such person will be deemed to have beneficial ownership of all securities that
such person has the right to acquire, whether such right is currently
exercisable or is exercisable only upon the occurrence of a subsequent
condition); and (ii) following the closing of any transaction referred to in
clause (i), neither the Corporation nor the acquiring or surviving entity has
a class of common securities (or American Depositary Receipts representing
such securities) listed on the New York Stock Exchange (the " _NYSE_ "), the
NYSE American LLC (the " _NYSE American_ ") or the NASDAQ Stock Market ("
_NASDAQ_ "), or listed or quoted on an exchange or quotation system that is a
successor to the NYSE, the NYSE American or NASDAQ.

 

(e) In the event the Corporation elects to redeem Series H Preferred Stock,
the notice of redemption will be mailed by the Corporation, postage prepaid,
not less than 30 nor more than 60 days prior to the redemption date, to each
holder of record of Series H Preferred Stock called for redemption at such
holders address as it appears on the stock transfer records of
the Corporation and shall state: (i) the redemption date; (ii) the number of
shares of Series H Preferred Stock to be redeemed; (iii) the redemption price;
(iv) the place or places where certificates (if any) for the Series
H Preferred Stock are to be surrendered for payment of the redemption price;
(v) that dividends on the shares to be redeemed will cease to accumulate on
the redemption date; (vi) whether such redemption is being made pursuant
to Section 6(a), Section 6(b) or Section 6(c); (vii) if applicable, that such
redemption is being made in connection with a Change of Control and, in that
case, a brief description of the transaction or transactions 

 



-5-  constituting such Change of Control; and (viii) if such redemption is being
made in connection with a Change of Control, that the holders of the shares of
Series H Preferred Stock being so called for redemption will not be able to
tender such shares of Series H Preferred Stock for conversion in connection
with the Change of Control and that each share of Series H Preferred Stock
tendered for conversion that is called, prior to the Change of Control
Conversion Date, for redemption will be redeemed on the related date of
redemption instead of converted on the Change of Control Conversion Date. If
less than all of the shares of Series H Preferred Stock held by any holder are
to be redeemed, the notice mailed to such holder shall also specify the
number of shares of Series H Preferred Stock held by such holder to be
redeemed. No failure to give such notice or any defect thereto or in the
mailing thereof shall affect the validity of the proceedings for the
redemption of any shares of Series H Preferred Stock except as to the holder
to whom notice was defective or not given.

 

(f) Holders of Series H Preferred Stock to be redeemed shall surrender the
Series H Preferred Stock at the place designated in the notice of redemption
and shall be entitled to the redemption price and any accumulated and unpaid
dividends payable upon the redemption following the surrender.

 

(g) If notice of redemption of any shares of Series H Preferred Stock has been
given and if the Corporation irrevocably sets aside the funds necessary for
redemption in trust for the benefit of the holders of the shares of Series H
Preferred Stock so called for redemption, then from and after the redemption
date (unless the Corporation shall default in providing for the payment
of the redemption price plus accumulated and unpaid dividends, if any),
dividends will cease to accumulate on those shares of Series H Preferred
Stock, those shares of Series H Preferred Stock shall no longer be deemed
outstanding and all rights of the holders of those shares will terminate,
except the right to receive the redemption price plus accumulated and unpaid
dividends, if any, payable upon redemption.

 

(h) If any redemption date is not a Business Day, then the redemption price
and accumulated and unpaid dividends, if any, payable upon redemption may be
paid on the next Business Day and no interest, additional dividends or other
sums will accrue on the amount payable for the period from and after that
redemption date to that next Business Day.

 

(i) If less than all of the outstanding shares of Series H Preferred Stock are
to be redeemed, the shares of Series H Preferred Stock to be redeemed shall
be selected _pro rata_ (as nearly as may be practicable without creating
fractional shares) or by any other equitable method the Board shall determine
that will not result in the automatic transfer of any shares of Series
H Preferred Stock to a trust pursuant to Article XI of the Charter (as to
restrictions on transfer and ownership of the Corporations capital stock).

 

(j) Immediately prior to any redemption of Series H Preferred Stock, the
Corporation shall pay, in cash, any accumulated and unpaid dividends to, but
not including, the redemption date, unless a redemption date falls after a
Dividend Record Date and prior to the corresponding Dividend Payment Date, in
which case each holder of Series H Preferred Stock at the close of business
on such Dividend Record Date shall be entitled to the dividend payable on
such shares on the corresponding Dividend Payment Date notwithstanding the
redemption of such shares before such Dividend Payment Date. Except as
provided in this Section 6(j), the Corporation will make no payment or
allowance for unpaid dividends, whether or not in arrears, on shares of the
Series H Preferred Stock to be redeemed.

 



-6- (k) Unless full cumulative dividends on all shares of Series H Preferred Stock
shall have been or contemporaneously are declared and paid or declared and a
sum sufficient for the payment thereof has been or contemporaneously is set
apart for payment for all past dividend periods, no shares of Series H
Preferred Stock shall be redeemed unless all outstanding shares of Series H
Preferred Stock are simultaneously redeemed and the Corporation shall not
purchase or otherwise acquire directly or indirectly any shares of Series H
Preferred Stock (except by exchanging it for its capital stock ranking junior
to the Series H Preferred Stock as to dividends and upon liquidation);
_provided, however_ , that the foregoing shall not prevent the purchase or
acquisition by the Corporation of shares of Series H Preferred Stock
to preserve its REIT status for federal income tax purposes or pursuant to a
purchase or exchange offer made on the same terms to holders of all
outstanding shares of Series H Preferred Stock.

 

(l) Subject to applicable law, the Corporation may purchase shares of Series H
Preferred Stock in the open market, by tender or by private agreement.

(m) Any shares of Series H Preferred Stock that the Corporation acquires in
any manner shall return to the status of authorized but unissued shares of
Preferred Stock, without designation as to class or series, and may thereafter
be reissued as any class or series of Preferred Stock.

 

Section 7. _Conversion Rights_. Shares of Series H Preferred Stock are not
convertible into or exchangeable for any other property or securities of the
Corporation, except as provided in this Section 7\.

(a) Upon the occurrence of a Change of Control, each holder of Series H
Preferred Stock will have the right (unless, prior to the Change of Control
Conversion Date, the Corporation has provided notice of its election to redeem
some or all of the shares of Series H Preferred Stock held by such holder
pursuant to Section 6, in which case such holder will have the right only with
respect to shares of Series H Preferred Stock that are not called for
redemption) to convert some or all of the Series H Preferred Stock held by
such holder (the " _Change of Control Conversion Right_ ") on the Change of
Control Conversion Date into a number of shares of Common Stock per share of
Series H Preferred Stock (the " _Common Stock Conversion Consideration_
") equal to the lesser of: (i) the quotient obtained by dividing (x) the sum
of the $25.00 liquidation preference per share of Series H Preferred Stock
plus the amount of any accumulated and unpaid dividends thereon to, but not
including, the Change of Control Conversion Date (unless the Change of
Control Conversion Date is after a Dividend Record Date and prior to the
corresponding Dividend Payment Date for the Series H Preferred Stock, in which
case no additional amount for such accrued and unpaid dividends will be
included in this sum) by (y) the Common Stock Price (as defined below) (such
quotient, the " _Conversion Rate_ "); and (ii) [●]2 (the " _Share Cap_ "),
subject to adjustments provided in Section 7(b) below.

(b) The Share Cap is subject to pro rata adjustments for any share splits
(including those effected pursuant to a distribution of Common Stock to
existing holders of Common Stock), subdivisions or combinations (in each case,
a " _Share Split_ ") with respect to Common Stock as follows: the adjusted
Share Cap as the result of a Share Split will be the number of shares of
Common Stock that is equivalent to the product obtained by multiplying (i) the
Share Cap in effect immediately prior to such

 



   2  |

NTD: Share cap to be adjusted to preserve the economics of the Mountain Series
A Preferred Stock. Formula would be: New Share Cap is equal to (A) Old Share
Cap, multiplied by (B) a fraction in which (i) the numerator is equal to the
sum of (x) the cash portion of the mixed consideration and (y) the product of
(1) the stock portion of the mixed consideration and (2) the Annaly stock
price as of closing (measured using a 10-day VWAP prior to closing), and (ii)
the denominator is the Annaly stock price as of closing.  

---|--- 
 



-7-  Share Split by (ii) a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of
shares of Common Stock outstanding immediately after giving effect to such
Share Split and the denominator of which is the number of shares of Common
Stock outstanding immediately prior to such Share Split. For the avoidance of
doubt, subject to the immediately succeeding sentence, the aggregate number of
shares of Common Stock (or equivalent Alternative Conversion Consideration
(as defined below), as applicable) issuable or deliverable, as applicable, in
connection with the exercise of the Change of Control Conversion Right will
not exceed the product of the Share Cap times the aggregate number of shares
of the Series H Preferred Stock issued and outstanding at the Change of
Control Conversion Date (or equivalent Alternative Conversion Consideration,
as applicable) (the " _Exchange Cap_ "). The Exchange Cap is subject to pro
rata adjustments for any Share Splits on the same basis as the corresponding
adjustment to the Share Cap.

(c) The " _Change of Control Conversion Date_ " is the date the Series H
Preferred Stock is to be converted, which will be a Business Day selected by
the Corporation that is no fewer than 20 days nor more than 35 days after the
date on which it provides the notice described in Section 7(h) to the holders
of Series H Preferred Stock.

(d) The " _Common Stock Price_ " is (i) if the consideration to be received
in the Change of Control by the holders of Common Stock is solely cash, the
amount of cash consideration per share of Common Stock or (ii) if the
consideration to be received in the Change of Control by holders of Common
Stock is other than solely cash (x) the average of the closing sale prices per
share of Common Stock (or, if no closing sale price is reported, the average
of the closing bid and ask prices per share or, if more than one in either
case, the average of the average closing bid and the average closing ask
prices per share) for the ten consecutive trading days immediately preceding,
but not including, the date on which such Change of Control occurred as
reported on the principal U.S. securities exchange on which Common Stock is
then traded, or (y) the average of the last quoted bid prices for Common Stock
in the over-the-counter market as reported by OTC Link LLC or similar
organization for the ten consecutive trading days immediately preceding, but
not including, the date on which such Change of Control occurred, if Common
Stock is not then listed for trading on a U.S. securities exchange.

(e) In the case of a Change of Control pursuant to which Common Stock is or
will be converted into cash, securities or other property or assets
(including any combination thereof) (the " _Alternative Form Consideration_
"), a holder of Series H Preferred Stock will receive upon conversion of such
Series H Preferred Stock the kind and amount of Alternative Form
Consideration which such holder would have owned or been entitled to receive
upon the Change of Control had such holder held a number of shares of Common
Stock equal to the Common Stock Conversion Consideration immediately prior to
the effective time of the Change of Control (the " _Alternative Conversion
Consideration_ "; the Common Stock Conversion Consideration or the Alternative
Conversion Consideration, whichever shall be applicable to a Change
of Control, is referred to as the " _Conversion Consideration_ ").

(f) If the holders of Common Stock have the opportunity to elect the form of
consideration to be received in the Change of Control, the Conversion
Consideration in respect of such Change of Control will be deemed to be the
kind and amount of consideration actually received by holders of a majority
of the outstanding shares of Common Stock that made or voted for such an
election (if electing between two types of consideration) or holders of a
plurality of the outstanding shares of Common Stock that made or voted for
such an election (if electing between more than two types of consideration),
as the case may be, and will be subject to any limitations to which all
holders of Common Stock are subject, including, without limitation, pro rata
reductions applicable to any portion of the consideration payable in such
Change of Control.

 



-8- (g) No fractional shares of Common Stock upon the conversion of the Series H
Preferred Stock in connection with a Change of Control will be issued.
Instead, the Corporation will make a cash payment equal to the value of such
fractional shares based upon the Common Stock Price used in determining the
Common Stock Conversion Consideration for such Change of Control.

(h) Within 15 days following the occurrence of a Change of Control, provided
that the Corporation has not then exercised its right to redeem all shares of
Series H Preferred Stock pursuant to Section 6, the Corporation will provide
to holders of Series H Preferred Stock a notice of occurrence of the Change of
Control that describes the resulting Change of Control Conversion Right,
which notice shall be delivered to the holders of record of the shares of the
Series H Preferred Stock at their addresses as they appear on the stock
transfer records of the Corporation and shall state: (i) the events
constituting the Change of Control; (ii) the date of the Change of Control;
(iii) the last date on which the holders of Series H Preferred Stock may
exercise their Change of Control Conversion Right; (iv) the method and period
for calculating the Common Stock Price; (v) the Change of Control Conversion
Date; (vi) that if, prior to the Change of Control Conversion Date, the
Corporation has provided notice of its election to redeem all or any shares
of Series H Preferred Stock, holders will not be able to convert the shares of
Series H Preferred Stock called for redemption and such shares will be
redeemed on the related redemption date, even if such shares have already
been tendered for conversion pursuant to the Change of Control Conversion
Right; (vii) if applicable, the type and amount of Alternative Conversion
Consideration entitled to be received per share of Series H Preferred Stock;
(viii) the name and address of the paying agent, transfer agent and
conversion agent for the Series H Preferred Stock; (ix) the procedures that
the holders of Series H Preferred Stock must follow to exercise the Change of
Control Conversion Right (including procedures for surrendering shares for
conversion through the facilities of a Depositary (as defined below)),
including the form of conversion notice to be delivered by such holders as
described below; and (x) the last date on which holders of Series H Preferred
Stock may withdraw shares surrendered for conversion and the procedures that
such holders must follow to effect such a withdrawal.

 

(i) The Corporation shall also issue a press release containing such notice
provided for in Section 7(h) for publication on Dow Jones and Company, Inc.,
Business Wire, PR Newswire or Bloomberg Business News (or, if these
organizations are not in existence at the time of issuance of the press
release, such other news or press organization as is reasonably calculated
to broadly disseminate the relevant information to the public), and post a
notice on its website, in any event prior to the opening of business on the
first Business Day following any date on which it provides the notice provided
for in Section 7(h) to the holders of Series H Preferred Stock.

(j) To exercise the Change of Control Conversion Right, the holders of Series
H Preferred Stock will be required to deliver, on or before the close of
business on the Change of Control Conversion Date, the certificates (if any)
representing the shares of Series H Preferred Stock to be converted, duly
endorsed for transfer (or, in the case of any shares of Series H Preferred
Stock held in book-entry form through a Depositary, to deliver, on or before
the close of business on the Change of Control Conversion Date, the shares of
Series H Preferred Stock to be converted through the facilities of such
Depositary), together with a written conversion notice in the form provided by
the Corporation, duly completed, to its transfer agent. The conversion notice
must state: (i) the relevant Change of Control Conversion Date; (ii) the
number of shares of Series H Preferred Stock to be converted; and (iii) that
the Series H Preferred Stock is to be converted pursuant to the applicable
provisions of these Articles Supplementary.

 



-9- (k) Holders of Series H Preferred Stock may withdraw any notice of exercise of
a Change of Control Conversion Right (in whole or in part) by a written
notice of withdrawal delivered to the transfer agent of the Corporation prior
to the close of business on the Business Day prior to the Change of Control
Conversion Date. The notice of withdrawal delivered by any holder must state:
(i) the number of withdrawn shares of Series H Preferred Stock; (ii) if
certificated Series H Preferred Stock has been surrendered for conversion, the
certificate numbers of the withdrawn shares of Series H Preferred Stock; and
(iii) the number of shares of Series H Preferred Stock, if any, which remain
subject to the holders conversion notice.

 

(l) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in Sections 7(m) and
(n), if any shares of Series H Preferred Stock are held in book-entry form
through The Depository Trust Company (" _DTC_ ") or a similar depositary
(each, a " _Depositary_ "), the conversion notice and/or the notice of
withdrawal, as applicable, must comply with applicable procedures, if any, of
the applicable Depositary.

(m) Series H Preferred Stock as to which the Change of Control Conversion
Right has been properly exercised and for which the conversion notice has not
been properly withdrawn will be converted into the applicable Conversion
Consideration in accordance with the Change of Control Conversion Right on the
Change of Control Conversion Date, unless prior to the Change of Control
Conversion Date the Corporation has provided notice of its election to redeem
some or all of the shares of Series H Preferred Stock pursuant to Section 6,
in which case only the shares of Series H Preferred Stock properly
surrendered for conversion and not properly withdrawn that are not called for
redemption will be converted as aforesaid. If the Corporation elects to redeem
shares of Series H Preferred Stock that would otherwise be converted into the
applicable Conversion Consideration on a Change of Control Conversion Date,
such shares of Series H Preferred Stock will not be so converted and the
holders of such shares will be entitled to receive on the applicable
redemption date the redemption price as provided in Section 6\.

(n) The Corporation shall deliver all securities, cash and any other property
owing upon conversion no later than the third Business Day following the
Change of Control Conversion Date. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the persons
entitled to receive any shares of Common Stock or other securities delivered
on conversion will be deemed to have become the holders of record thereof as
of the Change of Control Conversion Date.

(o) In connection with the exercise of any Change of Control Conversion
Right, the Corporation shall comply with all applicable federal and state
securities laws and stock exchange rules in connection with any conversion of
Series H Preferred Stock into shares of Common Stock or other property.
Notwithstanding any other provision of the Series H Preferred Stock, no holder
of Series H Preferred Stock will be entitled to convert such Series H
Preferred Stock into shares of Common Stock to the extent that receipt of
such Common Stock would cause such holder (or any other person) to exceed the
applicable share ownership limitations contained in Article XI of the Charter,
unless the Corporation provides an exemption from this limitation to
such holder pursuant to Article XI of the Charter.

(p) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein and except as otherwise
required by law, the persons who are the holders of record of shares of
Series H Preferred Stock at the close of business on a Dividend Record Date
will be entitled to receive the dividend payable on the

 



-10-  corresponding Dividend Payment Date notwithstanding the conversion of those
shares after such Dividend Record Date and on or prior to such Dividend
Payment Date and, in such case, the full amount of such dividend shall be
paid on such Dividend Payment Date to the persons who were the holders of
record at the close of business on such Dividend Record Date. Except as
provided in this Section 7(p), the Corporation will make no allowance for
unpaid dividends that are not in arrears on the shares of Series H Preferred
Stock to be converted.

Section 8. _Voting Rights_.

(a) Holders of the Series H Preferred Stock will not have any voting rights,
except as set forth in this Section 8 or as otherwise required by law. On
each matter on which holders of Series H Preferred Stock are entitled to vote,
each share of Series H Preferred Stock will be entitled to one vote, except
that when shares of any other class or series of the Preferred Stock have the
right to vote with the Series H Preferred Stock as a single class on any
matter, the Series H Preferred Stock and the shares of each such other class
or series will have one vote for each $25.00 of liquidation
preference (excluding accumulated dividends).

(b) Whenever dividends on any shares of Series H Preferred Stock are in
arrears for six or more quarterly dividend periods, whether or not
consecutive, the number of directors constituting the Board will, subject to
the maximum number of directors authorized under the Bylaws of the Corporation
then in effect, be automatically increased by two (if not already increased
by two by reason of the election of directors by the holders of any other
class or series of Preferred Stock that the Corporation may issue and upon
which like voting rights have been conferred and are exercisable and
with which the Series H Preferred Stock is entitled to vote as a class with
respect to the election of those two directors) and the holders of Series H
Preferred Stock (voting separately as a class with all other classes or series
of Preferred Stock that the Corporation may issue and upon which like voting
rights have been conferred and are exercisable and which are entitled to vote
as a class with the Series H Preferred Stock in the election of those two
directors) will be entitled to vote for the election of those two additional
directors at a special meeting called by the Corporation at the request of the
holders of record of at least 25% of the outstanding shares of Series H
Preferred Stock or by the holders of any other class or series of Preferred
Stock upon which like voting rights have been conferred and are exercisable
and which are entitled to vote as a class with the Series H Preferred Stock in
the election of those two directors (unless the request is received less than
90 days before the date fixed for the next annual or special meeting of
stockholders of the Corporation, in which case, such vote will be held at the
earlier of the next annual or special meeting of stockholders of the
Corporation), and at each subsequent annual meeting until all dividends
accumulated on the Series H Preferred Stock for all past dividend periods and
the then current dividend period (if after a Dividend Record Date and prior to
the corresponding Dividend Payment Date for the then current dividend period)
shall have been fully paid or declared and a sum sufficient for the payment
thereof set aside for payment. In that case, the right of holders of the
Series H Preferred Stock to elect any directors will cease and, unless there
are other classes or series of Preferred Stock upon which like voting rights
have been conferred and are exercisable, any directors elected by holders of
the Series H Preferred Stock shall immediately resign and the number of
directors constituting the Board shall be reduced accordingly. In no event
shall the holders of Series H Preferred Stock be entitled pursuant to the
voting rights under this Section 8 to elect a director that would cause the
Corporation to fail to satisfy a requirement relating to director
independence of any national securities exchange or quotation system on which
any class or series of its capital stock is listed or quoted. For the
avoidance of doubt, in no event shall the total number of directors elected
by holders of the Series H Preferred Stock (voting separately as a class with
all other

 



-11-  classes or series of Preferred Stock that the Corporation may issue and upon
which like voting rights have been conferred and are exercisable and which are
entitled to vote as a class with the Series H Preferred Stock in the election
of such directors) pursuant to the voting rights under this Section 8 exceed
two.

 

(c) If a special meeting at a place within the United States designated by the
Corporation is not called by the Corporation within 30 days after request
from the holders of Series H Preferred Stock in Section 8(b), then the holders
of record of at least 25% of the outstanding Series H Preferred Stock may
designate a holder to call the meeting at the expense of the Corporation and
such meeting may be called by the holder so designated upon notice similar to
that required for annual meetings of stockholders and shall be held at the
place within the United States designated by the holder calling such meeting.
The Corporation shall pay all costs and expenses of calling and holding any
meeting and of electing directors pursuant to Section 8(b), including, without
limitation, the cost of preparing, reproducing and mailing the notice of such
meeting, the cost of renting a room for such meeting to be held, and the cost
of collecting and tabulating votes.

(d) If, at any time when the voting rights conferred upon the Series H
Preferred Stock pursuant to Section 8(b) are exercisable, any vacancy in the
office of a director elected pursuant to Section 8(b) shall occur, then such
vacancy may be filled only by the remaining such director or by vote of the
holders of record of the outstanding Series H Preferred Stock and any other
classes or series of Preferred Stock upon which like voting rights have been
conferred and are exercisable and which are entitled to vote as a class with
the Series H Preferred Stock in the election of directors pursuant to Section
8(b). Any director elected or appointed pursuant to Section 8(b) may be
removed only by the affirmative vote of holders of the outstanding Series
H Preferred Stock and any other classes or series of Preferred Stock upon
which like voting rights have been conferred and are exercisable and which
classes or series of Preferred Stock are entitled to vote as a class with the
Series H Preferred Stock in the election of directors pursuant to Section
8(b), such removal to be effected by the affirmative vote of a majority of the
votes entitled to be cast by the holders of the outstanding Series H Preferred
Stock and any such other classes or series of Preferred Stock, and may not be
removed by the holders of the Common Stock.

(e) So long as any shares of Series H Preferred Stock remain outstanding (or
as otherwise set forth below in this Section 8(e)), the Corporation will not,
without the affirmative vote or consent, given in person or by proxy, either
in writing or at a meeting, of the holders of at least two-thirds of the
votes entitled to be cast by the holders of the Series H Preferred Stock and
the holders of all other series of Preferred Stock ranking on a parity with
the Series H Preferred Stock that the Corporation may issue and upon which
like voting rights have been conferred and are exercisable, voting as a class:
(i) authorize or create, or increase the authorized or issued amount of, any
class or series of capital stock ranking senior to the Series H Preferred
Stock with respect to payment of dividends or the distribution of assets upon
liquidation, dissolution or winding up or reclassify any of the authorized
capital stock of the Corporation into such shares, or create, authorize or
issue any obligation or security convertible into or evidencing the right to
purchase any such shares; or (ii) amend, alter or repeal the provisions of the
Charter, whether by merger, consolidation or otherwise, so as to
materially and adversely affect any right, preference, privilege or voting
power of the Series H Preferred Stock (each, an " _Event_ "); _provided,
however_ , with respect to the occurrence of any Event set forth in clause
(ii), so long as the Series H Preferred Stock remains outstanding with the
terms thereof materially unchanged (or a substantially similar security to the
Series H Preferred Stock is issued), taking into account that, upon an
occurrence of an Event, the Corporation may not be the surviving entity, the
occurrence of any such Event shall not be deemed to materially and adversely
affect such rights, preferences, privileges or voting power of holders

 



-12-  of the Series H Preferred Stock and, _provided further_ , that any increase
in the amount of the authorized Preferred Stock, including the Series H
Preferred Stock, or the creation or issuance of any additional shares of
Series H Preferred Stock or other classes or series of Preferred Stock that
the Corporation may issue, or any increase in the amount of authorized shares
of such class or series, in each case ranking on a parity with or junior to
the Series H Preferred Stock that the Corporation may issue with respect to
payment of dividends or the distribution of assets upon liquidation,
dissolution or winding up, shall not be deemed to materially and adversely
affect such rights, preferences, privileges or voting powers.

(f) The voting rights provided for in this Section 8 will not apply if, at or
prior to the time when the act with respect to which voting by holders of the
Series H Preferred Stock would otherwise be required pursuant to this Section
8 shall be effected, all outstanding shares of Series H Preferred Stock shall
have been redeemed or called for redemption upon proper notice and sufficient
funds shall have been deposited in trust to effect such redemption pursuant to
Section 6\.

 

(g) Except as expressly stated in this Section 8 or as may be required by
applicable law, the Series H Preferred Stock will not have any relative,
participating, optional or other special voting rights or powers and the
consent of the holders thereof shall not be required for the taking of any
corporate action.

 

Section 9. _Information Rights_. During any period in which the Corporation
is not subject to Section 13 or 15(d) of the Exchange Act and any shares of
Series H Preferred Stock are outstanding, the Corporation will use its best
efforts to (i) transmit by mail (or other permissible means under the Exchange
Act) to all holders of Series H Preferred Stock, as their names and addresses
appear on the record books of the Corporation and without cost to such
holders, copies of the annual reports on Form 10-K and quarterly reports on
Form 10-Q, respectively, that the Corporation would have been required to
file with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the " _SEC_ ") pursuant to
Section 13 or 15(d) of the Exchange Act if it were subject thereto (other
than any exhibits that would have been required); and (ii) promptly, upon
request, supply copies of such reports to any holders or prospective holder of
Series H Preferred Stock. The Corporation will use its best efforts to mail
(or otherwise provide) the information to the holders of the Series H
Preferred Stock within 15 days after the respective dates by which a periodic
report on Form 10-K or Form 10-Q, as the case may be, in respect of such
information would have been required to be filed with the SEC, if the
Corporation were subject to Section 13 or 15(d) of the Exchange Act, in each
case, based on the dates on which the Corporation would be required to file
such periodic reports if it were a "non-accelerated filer" within the meaning
of the Exchange Act.

 

Section 10\. _No Preemptive Rights_. No holders of the Series H Preferred
Stock will, as holders of Series H Preferred Stock, have any preemptive
rights to purchase or subscribe for Common Stock or any other security of the
Corporation.

 

Section 11. _Restrictions on Ownership and Transfer_. The Series H Preferred
Stock shall be subject to the restrictions on ownership and transfer set
forth in Article XI of the Charter. Any person who violates such restrictions
in acquiring beneficial or constructive ownership of shares of Series H
Preferred Stock is required to give written notice thereof immediately to the
Corporation and provide the Corporation with such other information as the
Corporation may request in order to determine the effect of such acquisition
on the Corporations status as a REIT. Any certificates representing shares of
the Series H Preferred Stock shall be marked with a legend sufficient under
the laws of the State of Maryland to provide a purchaser of such shares with
notice of the restrictions on transfer under Article XI of the Charter.
Nothing in 

 



-13-  Article XI of the Charter shall preclude the settlement of any transactions
entered into through the facilities of any national securities exchange or
automated inter-dealer quotation system. The fact that settlement of any
transaction takes place shall not, however, negate the effect of any provision
of Article XI of the Charter, and any transferee, and the shares of Series H
Preferred Stock transferred to such transferee in such a transaction, shall
be subject to all of the provisions and limitations in Article XI of the
Charter.

Section 12. _Record Holders_. The Corporation and the transfer agent for the
Series H Preferred Stock may deem and treat the record holder of any Series H
Preferred Stock as the true and lawful owner thereof for all purposes, and
neither the Corporation nor the transfer agent shall be affected by any
notice to the contrary.

Section 13. _Permissible Distributions_. In determining whether a
distribution (other than upon liquidation, dissolution or winding up), whether
by dividend, or upon redemption or other acquisition of shares or otherwise,
is permitted under Maryland law, amounts that would be needed, if the
Corporation were to be dissolved at the time of the distribution, to satisfy
the preferential rights upon dissolution of holders of shares of any class or
series of stock whose preferential rights upon dissolution are superior or
prior to those receiving the distribution shall not be added to the
Corporations total liabilities.

Section 14. _Office or Agency_. For so long as any shares of Series H
Preferred Stock are outstanding, the Corporation shall at all times maintain
an office or agency in one of the 48 contiguous States of the United States of
America where shares of Series H Preferred Stock may be surrendered for
payment (including upon redemption), registration of transfer or exchange.

_SECOND_ : The Series H Preferred Stock have been classified and designated
by the Board of Directors under the authority contained in the Charter. The
reclassification of shares of Common Stock into Preferred Stock pursuant to
the first paragraph of Article FIRST increases the number of
shares classified as Preferred Stock from shares
immediately prior to the reclassification to  shares
immediately after the reclassification. The reclassification decreases the
number of shares classified as Common Stock from shares
immediately prior to the reclassification to  shares
immediately after the reclassification.

 

 _THIRD_ : These Articles Supplementary have been approved by the Board in the
manner and by the vote required by law.

 

 _FOURTH_ : These Articles Supplementary shall be effective at the time the
State Department of Assessments and Taxation of Maryland accepts these
Articles Supplementary for record.

_FIFTH_ : The undersigned acknowledges these Articles Supplementary to be
the corporate act of the Corporation and, as to all matters or facts required
to be verified under oath, the undersigned acknowledges that to the best of
his knowledge, information and belief, these matters and facts are true in all
material respects and that this statement is made under the penalties for
perjury.

 _Annaly Capital Management, Inc._

 

 _Qualification as_

_Real Estate Investment Trust_

Ladies and Gentlemen:

 

We have acted as counsel to Annaly Capital Management, Inc., a Maryland
corporation (the "Company"), in connection with (i) the proposed exchange
offer and subsequent merger (the " _Merger_ ") of MTGE Investment Corp., a
Maryland corporation, with and into Mountain Merger Sub Corporation ("
_Mountain Merger Sub_ "), a Maryland corporation and "qualified REIT
subsidiary" within the meaning of section 856(i)(2) of the Internal Revenue
Code of 1986, as amended (the " _Code_ ") of the Company, pursuant to the
Agreement and Plan of Merger, by and among the Company, Mountain Merger Sub,
and Mountain, dated as of May [●], 2018 (the " _Merger Agreement_ ") and (ii)
the preparation of the Registration Statement on Form S-4 filed by the Company
with the Securities and Exchange Commission, as amended through the date
hereof (the " _Registration Statement_ "), with respect to the Merger. This
opinion is being provided to you pursuant to section 7.11(c) of the Merger
Agreement.

 

In giving this opinion letter, we have examined, and with your consent, relied
upon, the following:

 



     | 1. | the Registration Statement; 
---|---|--- 



     | 2. | the Merger Agreement; 
---|---|--- 



     | 3. | the Companys Articles of Amendment and Restatement, as filed
on February 4, 1997 with the Department of Assessments and Taxation of the
State of Maryland, as amended and supplemented through the date hereof;  
---|---|--- 



     | 4. | such other documents as we have deemed necessary or
appropriate for purposes of this opinion.

In connection with the opinions rendered below, we have assumed, with your
consent, that: 

1\. each of the documents referred to above has been duly authorized,
executed, and delivered; is authentic, if an original, or is accurate, if a
copy; and has not been amended;

2\. during its taxable year ending December 31, 2018, and future taxable
years, the Company has operated and will operate in a manner that will make
the factual representations contained in a certificate, dated the date hereof
and executed by a duly appointed officer of the Company (the " _Company
Officer s Certificate_"), true for such years;

3\. during its taxable year ending on the date of the Merger, Mountain has
operated and will operate in a manner that will make the factual
representations contained in a certificate, dated the date hereof and executed
by a duly appointed officer of Mountain (the " _Mountain Officer s
Certificate_" and together with the Company Officers Certificate, the "
_Officer s Certificates_"), true for such taxable year ending on the date of
the Merger;

 

4\. neither the Company nor Mountain will make any amendments to its
organizational documents after the date of this opinion that would affect its
qualification as a REIT for any taxable year; and

5\. no action will be taken by the Company or Mountain after the date hereof
that would have the effect of altering the facts upon which the opinions set
forth below are based.

In connection with the opinions rendered below, we also have relied upon the
correctness of the factual representations contained in the Officers
Certificates and the factual matters discussed in the Registration Statement
that relate to the Companys status as a REIT. No facts have come to our
attention that would cause us to question the accuracy and completeness of
such factual representations. Furthermore, with respect to the Company
Officers Certificate, where such factual representations involve terms
defined in the Code, the Treasury regulations thereunder (the " _Regulations_
"), published rulings of the Internal Revenue Service (the " _Service_ "), or
other relevant authority, we have reviewed with the individual making
such representations the relevant provisions of the Code, the applicable
Regulations and published administrative interpretations thereof.

 

Based solely on the documents and assumptions set forth above, the
representations set forth in the Officers Certificates, and the discussion
in the Registration Statement under the caption "Material U.S. Federal Income
Tax Consequences" (which is [ ]

 

[ ], 2018

 

Page 3



 

 incorporated herein by reference), we are of the opinion that (A) at all
times since its taxable year ended December 31, 2014 through the date of the
expiration of the Offer, the Company has been organized and operated in
conformity with the requirements for qualification as a REIT under the Code
and (B) the proposed method of operation of the Company will enable the
Company to continue to meet the requirements for qualification as a REIT
under the Code.

We will not review on a continuing basis the Companys or Mountains
compliance with the documents or assumptions set forth above, or the
representations set forth in the Officers Certificates. Accordingly, no
assurance can be given that the actual results of the Companys operations for
any given taxable year will satisfy the requirements for qualification and
taxation as a REIT. Although we have made such inquiries and performed such
investigations as we have deemed necessary to fulfill our professional
responsibilities as counsel, we have not undertaken an independent
investigation of all the facts referred to in this letter or the Officers
Certificates. In particular, we note that the Company has engaged in
transactions in connection with which we have not provided legal advice and
may not have reviewed. Moreover, we note that we did not represent the
Company as tax counsel prior to June 1, 2016.

The foregoing opinion is based on current provisions of the Code, the
Regulations, published administrative interpretations thereof, and published
court decisions. The Service has not issued Regulations or administrative
interpretations with respect to various provisions of the Code relating to
REIT qualification. No assurance can be given that the law will not change in
a way that will prevent the Company from qualifying as a REIT.

 

The foregoing opinion is limited to the U.S. federal income tax matters
addressed herein, and no other opinions are rendered with respect to other
U.S. federal tax matters or to any issues arising under the tax laws of any
other country, or any state or locality. Additional issues may exist that
could affect the federal tax treatment of the transaction that is the subject
of the opinion, and this opinion letter does not consider or provide a
conclusion with respect to any such additional issues. We undertake no
obligation to update the opinion expressed herein after the date of this
letter. This opinion letter is solely for the information and use of the
addressees, and it speaks only as of the date hereof. This opinion letter may
not be distributed, relied upon for any purpose by any other person, quoted in
whole or in part or otherwise reproduced in any document, or filed with any
governmental agency without our express written consent.

Very truly yours, [ ]

Re: MTGE Investment Corp.

 

Ladies and Gentlemen:

We have acted as special tax counsel to MTGE Investment Corp., a Maryland
corporation (the "Company") in connection with the transactions contemplated
by the Agreement and Plan of Merger dated as of May [●], 2018 (the "Merger
Agreement"), by and among the Company, Annaly Capital Management, Inc., a
Maryland corporation ("Parent"), and Mountain Merger Sub Corporation, a
Maryland corporation and a wholly-owned subsidiary of Parent ("Purchaser")
with respect to the proposed exchange offer and subsequent merger of the
Company with and into Purchaser, with Purchaser surviving the merger, and
certain other transactions. This opinion letter is being delivered to you
pursuant to Section 7.11(b) of the Merger Agreement. Capitalized terms used
herein which are defined in the Merger Agreement shall have the meanings set
forth in the Merger Agreement, unless otherwise defined herein

 

Bases for Opinion

The opinion set forth in this letter is based on relevant current provisions
of the U.S. Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code"), the
Treasury Regulations promulgated thereunder (including proposed and temporary
Treasury Regulations), and interpretations of the foregoing as expressed in
court decisions, applicable legislative history, and the administrative
rulings and practices of the U.S. Internal Revenue Service (the "IRS"),
including its practices and policies in issuing private letter rulings, which
are not binding on the IRS except with respect to a taxpayer that receives
such a ruling, all as of the date hereof. These provisions and interpretations
are subject to change by the IRS, Congress and the courts (as applicable),
which may or may not be retroactive in effect and which might result in
material modifications of our opinion. Our opinion does not foreclose the
possibility of a contrary determination by the IRS or a court of competent
jurisdiction, or of a contrary position taken by the IRS or the United States
Treasury Department in regulations or rulings issued in the future. In this
regard, an opinion of counsel with respect to an issue represents counsels
best professional judgment with respect to the outcome on the merits with
respect to such issue, if such issue were to be litigated, but an opinion is
not binding on the IRS or the courts, and is not a guarantee that the IRS will
not assert a contrary position with respect to such issue or that a court
will not sustain such a position asserted by the IRS.

In rendering the following opinion, we have examined such statutes,
regulations, records, agreements, certificates and other documents as we have
considered necessary or appropriate as a basis for the opinion, including but
not limited to (1) the registration statement on Form S-4 (Registration No.
333-[]) initially filed by Parent with the Securities and Exchange Commission
on [] [], 2018, as amended through the date hereof (together with the
documents incorporated by reference therein (the "Registration Statement")
under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, including the prospectus (the
"Prospectus") included therein, (2) the Merger Agreement, and (3) certain
organizational documents of the Company and certain of its subsidiaries
(those documents referred to in clauses (1) through (3), the "Reviewed
Documents").

 

The opinion set forth in this letter is premised on, among other things, the
written representations of the Company contained in a letter to us dated as
of the date hereof (the "Management Representation Letter"). Although we have
discussed the Management Representation Letter with the signatories thereto,
for purposes of rendering our opinion, we have not made an
independent investigation or audit of the facts set forth in the Reviewed
Documents and the Management Representation Letter. We consequently have
relied upon the representations and statements of the Company and Parent as
described in the Reviewed Documents and the Management Representation Letter,
and assumed that the information presented in such documents or otherwise
furnished to us is accurate and complete in all material respects. In
particular, we note that the Company has engaged in transactions in
connection with which we have not provided legal advice and may not have
reviewed. Moreover, we note that we did not represent the Company as special
tax counsel prior to April 19, 2018.

 

In this regard, we have assumed with your consent the following:

 

(1) that (A) all of the representations and statements as to factual
matters set forth in the Reviewed Documents and the Management Representation
Letter are true, correct and complete as of the date hereof, (B) any
representation or statement in the Reviewed Documents and the Management
Representation Letter made as a belief or made "to the knowledge of" or
similarly qualified is true, correct and complete as of the date hereof,
without such qualification, (C) each agreement described in the Reviewed
Documents is valid and binding in accordance with its terms, and (D) each of
the obligations of the Company and its subsidiaries, as described in the
Reviewed Documents, has been or will be performed or satisfied in accordance
with its terms;

 

(2) the genuineness of all signatures, the proper execution of all
documents, the authenticity of all documents submitted to us as originals,
the conformity to originals of documents submitted to us as copies, and the
authenticity of the originals from which any copies were made;

 

(3) that any documents as to which we have reviewed only a form were or
will be duly executed without material changes from the form reviewed by us;

(4) that the Merger Agreement is valid and binding in accordance with its
terms; 

(5) that the Offer and the Merger will be consummated in accordance with
the Merger Agreement (including satisfaction of all pre-closing covenants and
conditions to the obligations of the parties without amendment, waiver, or
breach thereof);

 

(6) that the Offer and the Merger, taken together, will qualify as a
"reorganization" within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code; Annaly Capital Management, Inc.

(7) that Parent will timely file a U.S. federal income tax return on Form
1120-REIT for the Company for its taxable year that ends on the Effective
Time;

(8) that Parent will comply with the requirements of Code Section
857(f)(1) and Treas. Reg. Sections 1.857-8 and 1.857-9 (related to records to
be maintained concerning stock ownership and information required to be
requested from shareholders as specified in applicable Treasury Regulations)
with respect to the Company for its taxable year that ends on the Effective
Time; and

 

(9) that, from and after the date of this letter, the Company and Parent
each will utilize all appropriate "savings provisions" (including the
provisions of Sections 856(c)(6), 856(c)(7), and 856(g) of the Code, and the
provision included in Section 856(c)(4) of the Code (flush language) allowing
for the disposal of assets within 30 days after the close of a calendar
quarter, and all available deficiency dividend procedures) available to the
Company and/or Parent under the Code in order to correct any violations of the
applicable real estate investment trust ("REIT") qualification requirements
of Sections 856 and 857 of the Code to the full extent the remedies under such
provisions are available.

 

Any material variation or difference in the facts from those set forth in the
documents that we have reviewed and upon which we have relied (including,
in particular, the Registration Statement, the Prospectus, and the Management
Representation Letter) may adversely affect the conclusions stated herein.

 

Opinion

Based upon, and subject to the assumptions and qualifications set forth
herein, including, without limitation, the discussion in the next three
paragraphs below, we are of the opinion that, commencing with the Companys
taxable year that ended on December 31, 2011 and through and including the
taxable year that ends on the Effective Time, the Company has been organized
and has operated in conformity with the requirements for qualification and
taxation as a REIT under the Code.

 

The Companys qualification and taxation as a REIT under the Code depends upon
the ability of the Company to meet on an ongoing basis (through
actual quarterly and annual operating results, distribution levels, diversity
of share ownership and otherwise) the various qualification tests imposed
under the Code, and upon the Company and/or Parent utilizing any and all
appropriate "savings provisions" (including the provisions of Sections
856(c)(6), 856(c)(7), and 856(g) of the Code and the provision included in
Section 856(c)(4) of the Code (flush language) allowing for the disposal of
assets within 30 days after the close of a calendar quarter, and all
available deficiency dividend procedures) available to the Company and/or
Parent under the Code to correct violations of specified REIT qualification
requirements of Sections 856 and 857 of the Code. Our opinion set forth above
does not foreclose the possibility that the Company and/or Parent may have to
utilize one or more of these "savings provisions" in the future, which could
require the Company and/or Parent to pay an excise or penalty tax
(which could be significant in amount) in order to maintain the Companys
REIT qualification. We have not undertaken to review the Companys and
Parents compliance with these requirements on a continuing basis.
Accordingly, no assurance can be given that the actual results of the
Companys operations, the sources of its income, the nature of its assets, the
level of its distributions to shareholders and the diversity of its share
ownership for any given taxable year will satisfy the requirements under the
Code for qualification and taxation as a REIT. Annaly Capital Management, Inc.

AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF 

MERGER

 

AMENDMENT TO MANAGEMENT AGREEMENT

 

THIS AMENDMENT TO MANAGEMENT AGREEMENT (this "Amendment") is made and entered
into as of this 2 day of May, 2018 by and between MTGE Investment Corp., a
Maryland corporation (the "Company"), MTGE TRS, LLC, a Delaware limited
liability company and a subsidiary of the Company ("MTGE TRS"), MTGE
Management, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company (the "Manager"), and
Annaly Capital Management, Inc., a Maryland corporation ("Parent"), solely for
the purposes of _Section_ __ _ 7_ hereof. The Company, MTGE TRS, the
Manager and Parent are each sometimes referred to herein as a "Party" and
collectively as the "Parties". Capitalized terms used herein but not defined
shall have the meanings ascribed to such terms in the Merger Agreement (as
defined below). For the avoidance of doubt, any reference herein to the
Company shall mean, from and after the Effective Time, the Surviving
Corporation.

 

RECITALS

WHEREAS, the Company (f/k/a American Capital Mortgage Investment Corp.), MTGE
TRS (f/k/a American Capital Mortgage Investment TRS, LLC) and the Manager
(f/k/a American Capital MTGE Management, LLC) previously entered into that
certain Amended and Restated Management Agreement, dated as of July 1, 2016
(the "Management Agreement");

WHEREAS, contemporaneously with the entry into this Amendment, the Company
has entered into that certain Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated as of May
2, 2018, by and among Parent, Mountain Merger Sub Corporation, a Maryland
corporation and a wholly owned subsidiary of Parent, and the Company (as may
be amended from time to time, the "Merger Agreement"); and

WHEREAS, in connection with the Merger Agreement and the transactions
contemplated thereby, the Parties desire, subject to the terms and conditions
set forth herein, to amend the Management Agreement to provide, among other
things, for: (i) the termination of the Management Agreement effective as of
the Termination Time (as defined below); and (ii) certain additional
obligations and agreements among the Parties and for the benefit of Parent.

NOW THEREFORE, in consideration of the mutual covenants and other good and
valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which are hereby
acknowledged, the Parties hereby agree as follows:

 

1\. TERMINATION

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the Management Agreement, the
Parties hereby agree that the Management Agreement and all rights and
obligations of the Parties thereunder shall be terminated effective as of one
(1) month following the Closing Date (as defined in the Merger Agreement)
(the "Termination Time", and such termination, the "Termination") and without
any further notice or action by each of the Parties, except that: (i) the
Company shall reimburse the Manager for the Unreimbursed Expenses (as defined
below) within five (5) business days following delivery to the Company of the
Managers report of such expenses; (ii) the Company shall pay to the Manager
the Accrued Management Fees (as defined below) within five (5) business days
following delivery to the Company of the Managers written statement setting
forth the  computation of such fees; (iii) the Manager shall take those actions
required by Section 13 of the Management Agreement upon the terms and
conditions set forth therein; and (iv) Sections 3(c), 5, 7 (to the extent any
Unreimbursed Expenses (as defined below) have previously been incurred or are
incurred in connection with the Termination (which includes, for the avoidance
of doubt, all third-party legal, expert and other fees and expenses relating
to any actions, proceedings, lawsuits, demands, causes of action and claims,
whether actual or threatened, made by or against the Company in connection
with, or after public announcement of, the Merger Agreement, the Offer, the
Merger or other Transactions)), 8, 13 and 14 of the Management Agreement shall
survive the Termination. The Termination shall be deemed a Termination Without
Cause (as defined in the Management Agreement) for the purposes of Section
3(c) of the Management Agreement. For the avoidance of doubt, any covenant or
agreement of the Parties contained in this Amendment which by its terms
contemplates performance after the Termination Time shall survive the
Termination, including, without limitation, such covenants and agreements
contained in this _Section_ __ _ 1_ and _Sections 4_ through _11_ hereof. For
purposes of this Amendment, "Unreimbursed Expenses" shall mean unreimbursed
expenses incurred by the Manager pursuant to the terms of the Management
Agreement prior to the Termination Time in the ordinary course of business and
consistent with past practice, to the extent reimbursable pursuant to Section
7 of the Management Agreement (including, for the avoidance of doubt,
pursuant to the last sentence of Section 7(c) of the Management Agreement),
subject to compliance with the provisions of Section 7(c) of the Management
Agreement, and "Accrued Management Fees" shall mean an amount equal to the
greater of (A) management fees payable for the period ending on the date
ninety (90) days after the date hereof or (B) unpaid management fees accrued
under Section 6 of the Management Agreement prior to the Termination Time, in
each case calculated in accordance with the terms of the Management Agreement
and whereby "Equity" (as defined in the Management Agreement) shall be
determined as of the end of the month which occurred immediately prior to the
Closing Date for any period following the Closing Date; provided, however,
that the management fees for the month in which the Termination Time occurs
shall be pro-rated based on the number of days in such month that have elapsed
up to and including the date on which the Termination Time occurs compared to
the total number of days in such month.

 

Following the Closing Date and until the Termination Time, the Manager hereby
agrees to continue to provide the services and activities (other than
investment advisory or investment management services) necessary or
appropriate to allow for an orderly transition of the management of the
Companys assets to Parent or Parents manager, as Parent may determine, or as
otherwise reasonably requested by Parent. For the avoidance of doubt, the
Manager shall not provide data migration services (but nothing herein shall
limit Parents ability to retain a third party service provider at its sole
cost to provide such services, and the Manager shall reasonably cooperate at
Parents sole cost in connection therewith).

The Parties shall comply in all respects with all the terms and conditions of
the Management Agreement and shall not amend the Management Agreement or this
Amendment, in each case without the prior written consent of Parent. Except as
specifically permitted or required by the Merger Agreement, as required
by law, or as consented to in writing by Parent (which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned), the Manager shall conduct its
activities with respect to the Company and the Companys subsidiaries in the
ordinary course of business consistent with past practice in all material
respects.

 



2 2\. TERMINATION PAYMENT

 

In consideration for the Termination and the other promises, undertakings and
releases of the Manager hereunder, the Company shall pay the termination
fee amount of $41,659,461.54 (the "Termination Payment"), which shall be the
"Termination Fee" under the Management Agreement, to the Manager as follows:
(i) on the Closing Date, $36,659,461.54 and (ii) on the date the Termination
Time occurs, $5,000,000 (such payment, the "Post-Closing Termination
Payment"), subject in each case to the Managers compliance with the terms and
conditions of the Management Agreement (including, for the avoidance
of doubt, as amended by this Amendment). Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary in the Management Agreement, the Parties acknowledge and agree that
the Termination Payment, together with any Unreimbursed Expenses and Accrued
Management Fees payable hereunder, if any, shall be the entire amount payable
to the Manager or any of its affiliates in connection with the Termination and
thereafter under or in respect of the Management Agreement, as amended by this
Amendment, unless the Merger Agreement is validly terminated pursuant to
Section 9.1 of the Merger Agreement without the occurrence of the Effective
Time, and except with respect to those rights and obligations which, pursuant
to _Section_ __ _ 1_ of this Amendment, survive the Termination. For the
avoidance of doubt, prior to the Termination, the Manager shall only be
entitled to receive payments from the Company that are consistent with past
practice and pursuant to the terms of the Management Agreement; provided that
this sentence shall not be deemed to limit any bona fide claims the Manager
may have (and payment thereof) pursuant to Sections 3(c), 7 (to the extent any
Unreimbursed Expenses have previously been incurred or are incurred in
connection with the Termination (which includes, for the avoidance of doubt,
all third-party legal, expert and other fees and expenses relating to any
actions, proceedings, lawsuits, demands, causes of action and claims, whether
actual or threatened, made by or against the Company in connection with, or
after public announcement of, the Merger Agreement, the Offer, the Merger or
other Transactions)), 8, 13 or 14 of the Management Agreement.

 

3\. NON-SOLICITATION

 

From and after the date hereof until the earlier of the Acceptance Time or the
date, if any, on which the Merger Agreement is validly terminated pursuant
to Section 9.1 of the Merger Agreement without the occurrence of the
Effective Time, the Manager agrees that it shall not intentionally and
knowingly take any action, directly or indirectly, that is prohibited to be
taken by the Companys Representatives (as defined in the Merger Agreement),
and shall otherwise comply with all obligations applicable to the Companys
Representatives, pursuant to Section 6.3 of the Merger Agreement. The Manager
shall not intentionally and knowingly take any action that would reasonably
be expected to cause any of the conditions to the Offer or the Merger to be
failed to be satisfied, other than actions which the Company is permitted to
take pursuant to the Merger Agreement or as required by applicable law. For
the avoidance of doubt, nothing in this Amendment shall (i) restrict the
Manager from assisting the Company in discussions or negotiations regarding an
Acquisition Proposal with any Person, solely to the extent to which the
Company is permitted to, and does, engage in such discussions or negotiations
with such Person pursuant to Section 6.3 of the Merger Agreement, in each case
in all respects in accordance with the Merger Agreement or (ii) limit or
otherwise modify the Companys obligations pursuant to Section 6.3 of the
Merger Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, actions or inactions taken or
not taken by any affiliate of the Manager in its capacity as a stockholder of
the Company with

 



3  respect to the Companys common stock owned by such stockholder shall not be
deemed to be a breach by the Manager of this Section 3\. Nothing in Section
6.3 of the Merger Agreement or this Section 3 shall require the Manager to
issue any press release or make any public statement.

5\. WAIVER

 

The Parties hereby waive, whether exercisable now or at any time in the
future, any and all rights to notice under the Management Agreement, to the
extent relating to the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement or
this Amendment.

6\. RELEASE

 

Effective as of, and contingent upon, the Termination, each Party and its
affiliates hereby fully and unconditionally release and forever discharge each
other Party and the affiliates of each other Party (including, as applicable,
the Company Subsidiaries, Parent, the affiliates of Parent and the Surviving
Corporation, and the affiliates of the Manager), and their respective
administrators, executors, representatives, successors and assigns, from any
and all actions, causes of action, suits, debts, accounts, covenants,
liabilities, disputes, agreements, promises, damages, judgments, executions,
claims, and demands whatsoever in law or in equity that they ever had, now
have, or that they or their administrators, executors, representatives,
successors and assigns hereafter can or may have, arising under or pursuant to
the Management Agreement, except with respect to those rights and obligations
which, pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 1_ of this Amendment, survive the
Termination.

7\. SUCCESSORS AND ASSIGNS; THIRD PARTY BENEFICIARIES; GUARANTEE

This Amendment shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the Parties
and their respective heirs, personal representatives, successors and assigns
as provided in this Amendment. Parent and its affiliates, successors and
assigns shall be entitled to rely on this Amendment in connection with the
consummation of the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement. Parent
shall be an express third party beneficiary of this Amendment (including
applicable provisions of the Management Agreement) and Parent shall be
entitled to enforce such provisions as though it was a party hereto or thereto
_._  

Effective as of, and contingent upon, the Closing, Parent fully and
unconditionally guarantees the timely and full performance of the
indemnification and payment obligations of the Company under this Amendment
and the Management Agreement as if it were the Company. Parent waives
promptness, diligence, notice of acceptance and any other notice with respect
to its guaranteed obligations and this paragraph and all demands whatsoever.
Parent covenants that the guarantee in this paragraph will not be discharged,
except by complete performance of the obligations contained in this Amendment.
In addition, effective as of, and contingent upon, the Closing, Parent shall
deposit the Post-Closing Termination Payment into an escrow fund or provide to
the Manager a letter of credit in respect of the Post-Closing Termination
Payment, in each case upon terms and conditions reasonably acceptable to the
Manager and Parent.

 



4 8\. ENTIRE AGREEMENT

 

The Management Agreement and this Amendment constitute the entire
understanding between the Parties with respect to the subject matter hereof
and supersede all prior discussions between them relating thereto. Any
amendment or modification to this Amendment shall be effective only if in
writing and signed by each Party, with the prior written consent of Parent.
This Amendment shall terminate and be of no force or effect in the event that
the Merger Agreement is terminated without the occurrence of the Effective
Time.

9\. COUNTERPARTS

 

This Amendment may be executed in multiple counterparts, each of which, when
executed and delivered, shall be deemed an original, but all of which
shall together constitute one and the same instrument.

10\. PAYMENTS

 

All payments to be made pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 1_ and _Section_ __ _ 2_
hereof shall be made by wire transfer, in immediately available funds, to the
account set forth on _Schedule 1_ or such other account designated by the
Manager in writing at least three (3) business days prior to such payment.

 

11\. GOVERNING LAW

This Amendment shall be governed by and interpreted and construed in
accordance with the laws of the State of New York, without regard to conflict
of laws principles thereof.
