material so filed or served, except as contemplated by this Agreement or with
the Parent and the Purchaser's prior written consent, acting reasonably,
provided that nothing herein shall require the Parent or the Purchaser to
agree or consent to any increase in, or variation of the form of, the
Consideration or other modification or amendment to such filed or served
materials that expands or increases the Parent's or Purchaser's obligations,
or diminishes or limits the Parent's or Purchaser's rights, set forth in any

 \t\t\tSection 2.7Election Mechanics \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(1)Letters of Transmittal and Election Forms must be received by the
Depositary on or before the date that is two (2) Business Days prior to the
date of the Company Meeting (the "Election Date"), unless otherwise agreed in
writing by the Purchaser and the Company. The Company shall provide at least
seven (7) Business Days' notice of the Election Date to Shareholders by means
of a news release disseminated over newswire services in Canada. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(2)Any Company Securityholder who does not deposit with the Depositary
a duly completed Letter of Transmittal and Election Form on or prior to the
Election Date, or otherwise fails to comply with the requirements of this
Section 2.7 and the Letter of Transmittal and Election Form (including Company
Shareholders who duly exercise Dissent Rights but are ultimately not entitled,
for any reason, to be paid fair value for Company Shares in respect of which
they have exercised Dissent Rights), shall be deemed to have elected to
receive, for each Company Share, the Share Consideration and the Contingent
Consideration. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(3)Until surrendered as contemplated by this Section 2.7, each
certificate that immediately prior to the Effective Time represented Company
Shares shall be deemed after the Effective Time to represent only the right to
receive upon such surrender the Consideration to which the holder is entitled
to receive in lieu of such certificate as contemplated in this Section 2.7.
Any such certificate formerly representing Company Shares not duly surrendered
on or before sixth (6th) anniversary of the Effective Date shall cease to
represent a claim by or interest of any former holder of Company Shares of any
kind or nature against or in Parent, Purchaser or Company. On such date,

 \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t  \t\t

 \t\t\t(4)Any Letter of Transmittal and Election Form, once deposited with
the Depositary, shall be irrevocable and may not be withdrawn by a Company
Securityholder. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\tSection 2.8Payment of Consideration on Closing \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(1)The Parent shall, following receipt by the Company of the Final
Order and immediately prior to the Effective Time, deposit in escrow with the
Depositary sufficient funds and irrevocable direction for sufficient Share
Consideration to satisfy the aggregate Initial Consideration payable to
Company Securityholders pursuant to the Plan of Arrangement. For greater
certainty, the Parent shall not be required pursuant to this Section 2.8 to
provide the Depositary, prior to the Effective Date, with any cash funds or
Parent Shares as Consideration for Company Shares held by Dissenting
Shareholders or to satisfy the Contingent Consideration (if any). \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(2)Upon surrender to the Depositary for cancellation of a certificate
which immediately prior to the Effective Time represented outstanding Company
Shares that were transferred to the Purchaser pursuant to the Plan of
Arrangement and/or the Company Compensation Option Certificate, as applicable,
together with a duly completed and executed Letter of Transmittal and Election
Form and such additional documents and instruments as the Depositary may
reasonably require, the Company Securityholder represented by such surrendered
certificate shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor the Initial
Consideration, and the Depositary shall deliver to such Company Securityholder
the Share Consideration and/or the Cash Consideration, as applicable, which
such Company Securityholder has the right to receive under the Arrangement for
such Company Shares, less any amounts withheld pursuant to Section 2.13, and
any certificate so surrendered shall forthwith be cancelled. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(1)Within 90 days following the end of the EBITDA Period, the
Purchaser shall present the Company Nominee with its draft calculation of the
Company EBITDA (the "Draft EBITDA Statement"), together with any source
materials reasonably requested by the Company Nominee. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\tFor the purposes hereof, "Company EBITDA" means the Company's net
income (or loss) (calculated in accordance with U.S. GAAP) before interest,
income taxes, depreciation, amortization and stock-based compensation for the
EBITDA Period; provided that, for greater certainty: (a) all revenue and costs
from the utilization by the Company of certain equipment purchased by the
Company (excluding the purchase price thereof) during the EBITDA Period shall
be included in Company EBITDA; (b) should any customer work for the account of
the Company be performed, at the Company's direction, by the Parent or the
Purchaser or by any other affiliate of the Parent during the EBITDA Period,
then seven percent (7%) of the gross revenue of the Parent, the Purchaser or
such affiliate of the Parent from the performance of such work shall be
attributed to the Company and included in the calculation of Company EBITDA;
(c) any transaction costs of the Company relating to the transactions
comprising the Arrangement shall be excluded from the calculation of Company
EBITDA; and (d) following Closing, the Company shall have access, at the
Company's discretion, to the \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t \t\t

 \t\t   \t\t\t25  \t\t

  

 \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t  \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\tParent's liability insurance, fuel, tire and all other purchasing
programs and the Company may use such programs to generate cost savings during
the EBITDA Period to the extent practicable for the Parent to make such
insurance and programs available to the Company. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(2)Within 30 days following delivery of the Draft EBITDA Statement,
the Company Nominee shall notify the Purchaser in writing if the Company
Nominee has any objections to the Draft EBITDA Statement (the "Notice of
Dispute"). The Notice of Dispute must state in reasonable detail the basis of
each objection and the approximate amounts in dispute (the "Disputed Items").
The Company Nominee will be deemed to: (a) have agreed with all other items
and amounts set forth in the Draft EBITDA Statement other than those specified
in the Notice of Dispute; (b) have accepted the Draft EBITDA Statement if the
Company Nominee does not notify Purchaser of any objection within such period
of 30 days; or (c) have accepted the Draft EBITDA Statement if the Company
Nominee notifies the Purchaser in writing in advance of the 30 day period
referred to above in (b), that it has no objection to such statement. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(3)If Company Nominee sends a Notice of Dispute in accordance with
Section 2.9(2), then the Purchaser and the Company Nominee will work
expeditiously and in good faith in an attempt to resolve such dispute within a
further period of 30 days after the date of the notification of such dispute
(the "Dispute Notice Period"), failing which the dispute may be submitted by
the Company Nominee or the Purchaser for final determination to the Managing
Partner of Deloitte LLP in Dallas, Texas, or if Managing Partner of Deloitte
LLP in Dallas, Texas is unwilling or unable to act, an independent nationally
recognized accounting firm mutually acceptable to the Purchaser and the
Company Nominee (the "Third Party Auditors"), both acting reasonably. The
Purchaser and the Company Nominee will use commercially reasonable efforts to
cause the Third Party Auditors to complete their work within 30 days of their
engagement. The Third Party Auditors shall allow the Purchaser and the Company
Nominee to present their respective positions regarding the Disputed Items and
the Purchaser, and the Company Nominee shall have the right to present
additional documents, materials and other information, and make an oral
presentation to the Third Party Auditors regarding the dispute. The Third
Party Auditors shall consider such additional documents, materials and other
information and such oral presentations. Any such other documents, materials
or other information shall be copied to the Purchaser and the Company Nominee
and each of the Purchaser and the Company Nominee shall be entitled to attend
any such oral presentation and to reply thereto. The Purchaser and the Company
Nominee, shall jointly instruct the Third Party Auditors that: (i) they shall
act as an expert in accounting, and not as an arbitrator, to resolve the
unresolved Disputed Items and amounts that were properly included in the
Notice of Dispute in accordance with this Agreement; (ii) they shall base
their decision solely on the written submissions of the Purchaser and the
Company Nominee and not on independent review; and (iii) they may not assign a
dollar value to any Disputed Item greater than the highest amount or less than
the lowest amount claimed by the Purchaser or the Company Nominee, as
applicable. Such written decision of the Third Party Auditors as to the
Disputed Items shall, absent manifest error, be final, binding and conclusive
on the Purchaser, the Company Nominee and the Company Securityholders. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(4)All fees of and costs related to the Third Party Auditors for the
purposes set out in this Section 2.9 and all fees of the Company Nominee's
legal counsel engaged in accordance with Section 8.1(5), as applicable,
(collectively, the "EBITDA Fees") shall be payable from the Contingent
Consideration and remitted by the Purchaser to the \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\tThird Party Auditors, the Company Nominee's legal counsel or such
other applicable person. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(5)Promptly following the 30-day (or shorter) period referred to in
Section 2.9(2) during which no Notice of Dispute was given or after the
resolution of any dispute in accordance with Section 2.9(3), as the case may
be, the Purchaser shall deliver to the Company Nominee an amended Draft EBITDA
Statement (the "Final EBITDA Statement") that reflects the decision of the
Purchaser and the Company Nominee or the Third Party Auditors (to the extent a
Notice of Dispute was given) in respect of the Disputed Items in accordance
with Section 2.9(3) (if any), or reflects the calculations set forth in the
Draft EBITDA Statement (to the extent no Notice of Dispute was given). The
Final EBITDA Statement, including the Company EBITDA set out in the Final
EBITDA Statement (the "Final Company EBITDA"), shall be final and binding upon
the Purchaser, the Company Nominee and the Company Securityholders upon
delivery thereof and shall not be subject to appeal, absent manifest
error. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(6)Promptly following delivery of the Final EBITDA Statement, the
Purchaser shall deposit with the Depositary funds in an amount (the
"Contingent Consideration") equal to (a) the lesser of: (i) the Contingent
Maximum Amount; and (ii) the product of (A) the number of Company Shares
outstanding as of the Effective Date less number of Company Shares held by
Dissenting Shareholders and (B) the following ratio: \t\t

 \t\t\tminus (b) the amount of the EBITDA Fees (if any). \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\tIf the Contingent Consideration is an amount less than $500,000, the
Purchaser shall not deposit any funds with the Depositary with respect to the
Contingent Consideration and no amounts shall be payable with respect to the
Contingent Consideration. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\tFor greater certainty, set out in Schedule E are three examples of the
calculation of Contingent Consideration. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(7)Promptly following delivery of the Contingent Consideration by the
Purchaser to the Depositary (if any), the Depositary shall deliver to the
Electing Company Securityholders their pro rata share of the Contingent
Consideration based on the number of Company Shares owned on the Effective
Date, less any amounts withheld pursuant to Section 2.13. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, the Depositary shall not make such payment of the Contingent
Consideration to a Company Securityholder until such Company Securityholder
has, in accordance with Section 2.8, surrendered to the Depositary for
cancellation of a certificate which immediately prior to the Effective Time
represented outstanding Company Shares and/or the Company Compensation Option
Certificate, as applicable, that were transferred to the Purchaser pursuant to
the Plan of Arrangement and a duly completed and executed Letter of
Transmittal and Election Form and such additional documents and instruments as
the Depositary may reasonably require. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(8)The Company and the Company Nominee each acknowledges and agrees
that (A) from and after the Effective Time, Parent and its Subsidiaries

its Subsidiaries are under no obligation to continue to serve any existing
client of the Company and its Subsidiaries (or Parent and its Subsidiaries)

Subsidiaries, any Company Securityholder or the Company Nominee, including an

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(9)In the event that at any time during the EBITDA Period, the Company
effects any Acquisition Proposal (or effects multiple transactions which, in
aggregate, would constitute an Acquisition Proposal), the Purchaser shall use
its reasonable commercial efforts to ensure that, notwithstanding the
occurrence of any such transaction(s), the revenues and expenses relating to
the operations of the Company's assets and properties existing as of the
Effective Date are accurately tracked by the Company and/or Purchaser during

continues to apply and that any information provided under Section 4.4(1)
above that is non-public and/or proprietary in nature shall be subject to the
terms of the Confidentiality Agreement; provided that to the extent any

 \t\t\tSection 4.5Pre-Acquisition Reorganization \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(1)Subject to Section 4.5(2), the Company agrees that, upon request of
the Parent and the Purchaser, the Company shall (i) perform such
reorganizations of its corporate structure, capital structure, business,
operations and assets or such other transactions as the Purchaser may request,
acting reasonably (each a "Pre-Acquisition Reorganization"), and (ii)

manner in which they would most effectively be undertaken. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(2)The Company will not be obligated to participate in any Pre-
Acquisition Reorganization under Section 4.5(1) unless such Pre-Acquisition
Reorganization: \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(a)can be completed prior to the Effective Date, and can be unwound in
the event the Arrangement is not consummated without adversely affecting the
Company in any material manner; \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(b)is not prejudicial to the Company or to the Company Securityholders
in any material respect; and \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(c)does not impair the ability of the Company to consummate, and will
not materially delay the consummation of, the Arrangement. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\tFurthermore, such Pre-Acquisition Reorganization will not be
considered in determining whether a representation or warranty of the Company
under this Agreement has been breached. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(3)The Parent and the Purchaser must provide written notice to the
Company of any proposed Pre-Acquisition Reorganization at least 15 Business
Days prior to the Effective Date. Upon receipt of such notice, the Company,
the Parent and the Purchaser shall work cooperatively and use their best
efforts to prepare prior to the Effective Time all documentation necessary and
do such other acts and things as are necessary to give effect to such Pre-
Acquisition Reorganization, including any amendment to this Agreement or the
Plan of Arrangement and shall seek to have any such Pre-Acquisition
Reorganization made effective as of the last moment of the Business Day ending

for all costs and expenses (including any reasonable professional fees and
expenses) associated with any Pre-Acquisition Reorganization to be carried out
at their request and shall indemnify and save harmless the Company and its
affiliates from and against any and all liabilities, losses, damages, claims,
costs, expenses, interest awards, judgements and penalties suffered or
incurred by any of them in connection with or as a result of any such Pre-
Acquisition Reorganization if after participating in any Pre-Acquisition
Reorganization the Arrangement is not completed other than due to a breach by
the Company of the terms and conditions of this Agreement. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\tSection 4.6Notice and Cure Provisions \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(1)Each Party shall promptly notify the other Parties of the
occurrence, or failure to occur, of any event or state of facts which
occurrence or failure would, or would be reasonably likely to: \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(a)cause any of the representations or warranties of such Party
contained in this Agreement to be untrue or inaccurate in any material respect
at any time from the date of this Agreement to the Effective Time; or \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(b)result in the failure, in any material respect, to comply with or
satisfy any covenant, condition or agreement to be complied with or satisfied
by such Party under this Agreement. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(2)Notification provided under this Section 4.8 will not affect the

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(3)The Parent and the Purchaser may not elect to exercise their right
to terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 7.2(1)(d)(i) and the Company
may not elect to exercise its right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to
Section 7.2(1)(c)(i), unless the Party seeking to terminate the Agreement (the
"Terminating Party") has delivered a written notice ("Termination Notice") to
the other Party (the "Breaching Party") specifying in reasonable detail all
breaches of covenants, representations and warranties or other matters which
the Terminating Party asserts as the basis for termination. After delivering a
Termination Notice, provided the Breaching Party is proceeding diligently to
cure such matter and such matter is capable of being cured prior to the
Outside Date, the Terminating Party may not exercise such termination right
until the earlier of (a) the Outside Date, and (b) the date that is 15
Business Days following receipt of such Termination Notice by Breaching Party,
if such matter has not been cured by such date. If the Terminating Party
delivers a Termination Notice prior to the date of the Company Meeting, unless
the Parties agree otherwise, the Company shall postpone or adjourn the Company
Meeting, to the earlier of (a) 10 Business Days prior to the Outside Date and

any, to the Company Securityholders regarding the Arrangement. No party hereto
shall issue any press release or make any other public statement or disclosure
with respect to this Agreement or the Arrangement without the consent of the
other Parties (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed),
and no party hereto may make any filing with any Governmental Entity with
respect to this Agreement or the Arrangement without the consent of the other

disclosure shall give reasonable consideration to any comments made by the
other Parties or their counsel, and if such prior notice is not possible,
shall give such notice immediately following the making of such disclosure or

 \t\t

 \t\t\tSection 4.8Insurance and Indemnification \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(1)Prior to the Effective Date, the Company shall purchase customary
"tail" policies of directors' and officers' liability insurance providing
protection no less favorable in the aggregate than the protection provided by
the policies maintained by the Company which are in effect immediately prior
to the Effective Date and providing protection in respect of claims arising
from facts or events which occurred on or prior to the Effective Date and the
Parent and the Purchaser will, or will cause the Company to maintain such tail
policies in effect without any reduction in scope or coverage for six (6)
years from the Effective Date; provided that neither the Parent nor the
Purchaser will be required to pay any amounts in respect of such coverage
prior to the Effective Time and provided further that the cost of such
policies shall not exceed 200% of the Company's current annual aggregate
premium for policies currently maintained by the Company. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(2)The Purchaser shall cause the Company to, honour all rights to
indemnification or exculpation now existing in favour of present and former

extent that they are (i) included in the Constating Documents of the Company
or any of its Subsidiaries, or (ii) disclosed in Section 3.1(25) [Collateral
Benefits] of the Company Disclosure Letter, and acknowledges that such rights
under both (i) and (ii) shall survive the completion of the Arrangement and
shall continue in full force and effect in accordance with their terms for a
period of not less than six (6) years from the Effective Date. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(3)If the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or any of their
respective successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any
other Person and is not a continuing or surviving corporation or entity of
such consolidation or merger, or (ii) transfers all or substantially all of
its properties and assets to any Person, the Purchaser shall ensure that any
such successor or assign (including, as applicable, any acquirer of
substantially all of the properties and assets of the Company or its
Subsidiaries) assumes all of the obligations set forth in this Section
4.8. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(d)accept, approve, endorse or recommend, or publicly propose to

that publicly taking no position or a neutral position with respect to a
publicly announced, or otherwise publicly disclosed, Acquisition Proposal for

terminated, any solicitation, encouragement, discussion, negotiations, or
other activities commenced prior to the date of this Agreement with any Person
(other than the Parent, the Purchaser and their respective Affiliates) with
respect to any inquiry, proposal or offer that constitutes, or may reasonably
be expected to constitute or lead to, an Acquisition Proposal for the Company,

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(3)The Company represents and warrants that the Company has not waived
any confidentiality, standstill, non-disclosure, non-solicitation, use,

obligations respecting the Company or any of its Subsidiaries under any
confidentiality, standstill, non-disclosure, non-solicitation, use, business
purpose or similar agreement, restriction or covenant to which the Company or
any Subsidiary is a party (it being acknowledged by the Parent and the
Purchaser that the automatic termination or release of any standstill
restrictions of any such agreements as the result of entering into of this

 \t\t

 \t\t\tSection 5.2Notification of Acquisition Proposals \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\tIf the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or any of the Company

 \t\t\tSection 5.3Responding to an Acquisition Proposal for the Company \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\tNotwithstanding Section 5.1, if at any time prior to obtaining the
Required Approval of the Arrangement Resolution, the Company receives a
written Acquisition Proposal for the Company, the Company may engage in or
participate in discussions or negotiations with such Person regarding such
Acquisition Proposal for the Company, and may provide copies of, access to or
disclosure of information, properties, facilities, books or records of the
Company or its Subsidiaries, if and only if: \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(1)the Company Board first determines in good faith, after
consultation with its financial advisors and its outside legal counsel, that
such Acquisition Proposal for the Company constitutes or would reasonably be
expected to constitute a Superior Proposal, and, after consultation with its
outside legal counsel, that the failure to engage in such discussions or
negotiations would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties; \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(2)such Person was not restricted from making such Acquisition
Proposal pursuant to an existing confidentiality, standstill, non-disclosure,
use, business purpose or similar restriction with the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries; \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(3)the Company has been, and continues to be, in compliance with its
obligations under this Article 5; \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(4)prior to providing any such copies, access or disclosure to such
Person, the Company enters into a confidentiality and standstill agreement
with such Person (unless such Person is already a party to a confidentiality
and standstill agreement with the Company) that contains a standstill
provision that is no less onerous or more beneficial to such Person than that
in the Confidentiality Agreement and is otherwise on terms that are no less
favorable to the Company than those found in the Confidentiality Agreement,
and any such copies, access or disclosure provided to such Person shall have
already been (or simultaneously be) provided to the Parent and the Purchaser
(by posting such information to the Company Data Room or otherwise); and \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t \t\t

 \t\t   \t\t\t46  \t\t

  

 \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t  \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(5)the Company promptly provides the Parent and the Purchaser
with: \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(a)two business days prior written notice stating the Company's
intention to participate in such discussions or negotiations and to provide
such copies, access or disclosure and that the Company Board has determined
that failure to take such action would be inconsistent with its fiduciary
duties; and \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(b)prior to providing any such copies, access or disclosure to such
Person, the Company provides the Parent and the Purchaser with a true,
complete and final executed copy of the confidentiality and standstill
agreement referred to in Section 5.3(4). \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\tSection 5.4Purchaser Right to Match \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(1)If the Company receives an Acquisition Proposal for the Company
that constitutes a Superior Proposal prior to receipt of the Required Approval
of the Arrangement Resolution, the Company may, subject to compliance with
Article 7 and Section 8.3, enter into a definitive agreement with respect to
such Acquisition Proposal, if and only if: \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(a)the Person making the Superior Proposal was not restricted from
making such Acquisition Proposal pursuant to an existing confidentiality,
standstill, non-disclosure, use, business purpose or similar restriction with
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries; \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(b)the Company has been, and continues to be, in compliance with its
obligations under this Article 5; \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(c)the Company has delivered to the Parent and the Purchaser a written
notice of the determination of the Company Board that such Acquisition
Proposal constitutes a Superior Proposal and of the intention of the Company
to enter into such definitive agreement with respect to such Superior
Proposal, together with a written notice from the Company Board regarding the
value and financial terms that the Company Board, in consultation with its
financial advisors, has determined should be ascribed to any non-cash
consideration offered under such Superior Proposal (the "Company Superior
Proposal Notice"); \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(d)the Company has provided the Parent and the Purchaser a copy of the
proposed definitive agreement for the Superior Proposal and all supporting
materials, including any financing documents supplied to the Company in
connection therewith; \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(e)at least five (5) Business Days (the "Company Matching Period")
have elapsed from the date that is the later of the date on which the Parent
and the Purchaser received the Company Superior Proposal Notice and the date
on which the Parent and the Purchaser received all of the materials set forth
in Section 5.4(1)(d); \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(f)during any Company Matching Period, the Parent and the Purchaser
have had the opportunity (but not the obligation), in accordance with Section
5.4(2), to offer to amend this Agreement and the Arrangement in order for such
Acquisition Proposal to cease to be a Superior Proposal; \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t \t\t

 \t\t   \t\t\t47  \t\t

  

 \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t  \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(g)after the Company Matching Period, the Company Board (i) has
determined in good faith, after consultation with its outside legal counsel
and financial advisors, that such Acquisition Proposal continues to constitute
a Superior Proposal (if applicable, compared to the terms of the Arrangement
as proposed to be amended by the Parent and the Purchaser under Section
5.4(2)) and (ii) has determined in good faith, after consultation with its
outside legal counsel and financial advisors, that the failure by the Company
Board to recommend that the Company enter into a definitive agreement with
respect to such Superior Proposal would be inconsistent with its fiduciary
duties; \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(h)prior to or concurrently with entering into such definitive
agreement the Company terminates this Agreement pursuant to Section
7.2(1)(c)(ii); and \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(i)prior to or concurrently with entering into such definitive
agreement the Company terminates this Agreement pursuant to Section
7.2(1)(c)(ii) and pays the Termination Fee pursuant to Section 8.3. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(2)During the Company Matching Period, or such longer period as the
Company may approve in writing for such purpose: (a) the Company Board shall
review any offer made by the Parent and the Purchaser under Section 5.4(1)(f)
to amend the terms of this Agreement and the Arrangement in good faith in
order to determine whether such proposal would, upon acceptance, result in the
Acquisition Proposal for the Company previously constituting a Superior
Proposal ceasing to be a Superior Proposal; and (b) the Company shall
negotiate in good faith with the Parent and the Purchaser to make such
amendments to the terms of this Agreement and the Arrangement as would enable
the Parent and the Purchaser to proceed with the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement on such amended terms. If the Company Board determines that
such Acquisition Proposal would cease to be a Superior Proposal, the Company
shall promptly so advise the Parent and the Purchaser and the Company and the
Parent and the Purchaser shall amend this Agreement to reflect such offer made
by the Parent and the Purchaser, and shall take and cause to be taken all such
actions as are necessary to give effect to the foregoing. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(3)Each successive material amendment or modification to any
Acquisition Proposal shall constitute a new Acquisition Proposal for the
purposes of this Section 5.4, and the Parent and the Purchaser shall be
afforded a new five (5) Business Day Company Matching Period from the later of
the date on which the Parent and the Purchaser received the Company Superior
Proposal Notice and the date on which the Parent and the Purchaser received
all of the materials set forth in Section 5.4(1)(d) from the Company. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(4)The Company Board shall promptly reaffirm the Company Board
Recommendation by press release after any Acquisition Proposal for the Company
which is not determined to be a Superior Proposal is publicly announced or
publicly disclosed or the Company Board determines that a proposed amendment
to the terms of this Agreement as contemplated under Section 5.4(2) would
result in an Acquisition Proposal no longer being a Superior Proposal. The
Company shall provide the Parent and the Purchaser and their outside legal
counsel with a reasonable opportunity to review the form and content of any
such press release and shall make all reasonable amendments to such press
release as requested by the Parent and the Purchaser and their counsel. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(5)If the Company provides a Company Superior Proposal Notice to the
Parent and the Purchaser after a date that is less than ten (10) Business Days
before the Company Meeting, the Company shall either proceed with or shall
postpone the Company Meeting to a date that is not more than fifteen (15)
Business Days after the scheduled date of the Company Meeting, as directed by
the Parent and the Purchaser acting reasonably; provided, however, that the
Company Meeting shall not be adjourned or postponed to a date later than five
(5) Business Days prior to the Outside Date. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(6)Nothing in this Agreement shall prevent the Company Board from,
subject to its obligations under Section 8.3, complying with section 2.17 of
Multilateral Instrument 62-104 - Takeover Bids and Issuer Bids and similar
provisions under Securities Laws relating to the provision of a directors'
circular in respect of an Acquisition Proposal for the Company. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\tSection 5.5Breach by Representatives \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\tWithout limiting the generality of the foregoing, the Company shall
advise the Company Representatives of the prohibitions set out in this Article
5 and any violation of the restrictions set forth in this Article 5 by the
Company or the Company Representatives is deemed to be a breach of this
Article 5 by the Company. \t\t

Section 8.3 are an integral part of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, and that without these agreements, neither the Purchaser nor the
Parent would enter into this Agreement, and that the amounts set out in this

the damages, including opportunity costs, reputational damages, and out-of-
pocket expenditures, which the Purchaser and/or the Parent will suffer or
incur as a result of the event giving rise to such damages and resultant
termination of this Agreement, and are not penalties. The Company irrevocably
waives any right it may have to raise as a defence that any such liquidated
damages are excessive or punitive. The Company agrees that the payment of the
Termination Fee pursuant to this Section 8.3 is in addition to any damages or
other payment or remedy to which the Purchaser and/or the Parent may be
entitled under Section 8.7. \t\t

(i) if sent by personal delivery or same day courier, on the date of delivery
if it is a Business Day and the delivery was made prior to 4:00 p.m. (local

a party's address that is not specifically changed in a notice will be assumed
not to be changed. Sending a copy of a notice or other communication to a

 \t\t

 \t\t\tSection 8.6Time of the Essence. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\tTime is of the essence in this Agreement. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\tSection 8.7Injunctive Relief. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\tThe parties hereto agree that irreparable harm would occur for which
money damages would not be an adequate remedy at law in the event that any of
the provisions of this Agreement were not performed in accordance with their
specific terms or were otherwise breached. It is accordingly agreed that the
parties hereto shall be entitled to injunctive and other equitable relief to
prevent breaches or threatened breaches of this Agreement, and to enforce
compliance with the terms of this Agreement without any requirement for the
securing or posting of any bond in connection with the obtaining of any such
injunctive or other equitable relief, this being in addition to any other
remedy to which the parties hereto may be entitled at law or in equity. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\tSection 8.8No Third Party Beneficiaries. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\tThe parties hereto intend that this Agreement will not benefit or
create any right or cause of action in favour of, any Person, other than the
parties hereto. No Person, other than the parties to this Agreement, is
entitled to rely on the provisions of this Agreement in any action, suit,
proceeding, hearing or other forum. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\tSection 8.9Waiver. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\tNo waiver of any of the provisions of this Agreement will constitute a
waiver of any other provision (whether or not similar). No waiver will be
binding unless executed in writing by the party hereto to be bound by the
waiver. A failure or delay of a party hereto in exercising any right under
this Agreement will not operate as a waiver of that right. A single or partial
exercise of any right will not preclude a party hereto from any other or
further exercise of that right or the exercise of any other right. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\tSection 8.10Entire Agreement. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\tThis Agreement, together with the Confidentiality Agreement,
constitutes the entire agreement between the parties hereto with respect to
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and supersedes all prior
agreements, understandings, negotiations and discussions, whether oral or
written, of the parties hereto; provided that to the extent any provisions of
the Confidentiality Agreement conflict with the terms of this Agreement, the
terms of this Agreement shall prevail. There are no representations,
warranties, covenants, conditions or other agreements, express or implied,
collateral, statutory or otherwise, between the parties hereto in connection
with the subject matter of this Agreement, except as specifically set forth in
this Agreement. The parties hereto have not relied and are not relying on any
other information, \t\t

this Agreement are assignable or transferable by any party hereto without the
prior written consent of the other parties hereto. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\tSection 8.12Severability. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\tIf any provision of this Agreement is determined to be illegal,
invalid or unenforceable by any court of competent jurisdiction, that
provision will be severed from this Agreement and the remaining provisions
shall remain in full force and effect. Upon such determination that any term
or other provision is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced, the
parties hereto shall negotiate in good faith to modify this Agreement so as to
effect the original intent of the parties hereto as closely as possible in an
acceptable manner to the end that the transactions contemplated hereby are
fulfilled to the fullest extent possible. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\tSection 8.13Governing Law. \t\t

 \t\t

accordance with the laws of the Province of Alberta and the federal laws of
Canada applicable therein. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(2)Each party hereto irrevocably attorns and submits to the non-
exclusive jurisdiction of the Alberta courts situated in the City of Calgary
and waives objection to the venue of any proceeding in such court or that such
court provides an inconvenient forum. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\tSection 8.14Rules of Construction. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\tThe parties to this Agreement waive the application of any Law or rule
of construction providing that ambiguities in any agreement or other document
shall be construed against the party drafting such agreement or other
document. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\tSection 8.15No Liability. \t\t

 \t\t\tNo director or officer of the Parent or the Purchaser shall have any
personal liability whatsoever to the Company under this Agreement or any other
document delivered in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby on
behalf of the Parent or the Purchaser. No director or officer of the Company
or any of its Subsidiaries shall have any personal liability whatsoever to the

 \t\t

rounded \t\t

 \t\t\tRIGHTS OF DISSENT \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t4.1Rights of Dissent. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\tPursuant to the Interim Order, registered holders of Common Shares may
exercise dissent rights ("Dissent Rights") under section 191 of the ABCA, as
modified by this Article 4, the Interim Order and the Final Order, with
respect to their Common Shares in connection with the Arrangement, provided
however that written objection to the Arrangement Resolution contemplated by
subsection 191(5) of the ABCA must be received by the Company not later than
5:00 p.m. (Calgary time) on the Business Day that is two Business Days
immediately preceding the date of the Company Meeting (as it may be adjourned
or postponed from time to time). Registered holders of Common Shares who duly
exercise their Dissent Rights with respect to their Common Shares ("Dissenting
Shares") shall be deemed to have transferred the Common Shares held by them
and in respect of which Dissent Rights have been validly exercised to the
Purchaser free and clear of all Liens, as provided in Section 3.3(h), and if
they: \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(a)ultimately are entitled to be paid fair value for their Dissenting
Shares: (i) shall be deemed not to have participated in the transactions in
Article 3 (other than Section 3.3(h)), (ii) will be entitled to be paid by the
Purchaser the fair value of such Dissenting Shares, which fair value,
notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in the ABCA, shall be
determined as of the close of business on the day before the Arrangement
Resolution was adopted; and (iii) will not be entitled to any other payment or
consideration, including any payment that would be payable under the
Arrangement had such holders not exercised their Dissent Rights in respect of
such Dissenting Shares; or \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(b)ultimately are not entitled, for any reason, to be paid fair value
for such Dissenting Shares shall be deemed to have participated in the
Arrangement on the same basis as an Electing Securityholder; \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\tbut in no case will the Company be required to recognize such persons
as holding Common Shares on or after the Effective Date. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t4.2Recognition of Dissenting Shareholders. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(a)In no circumstances shall the Purchaser, the Parent, the Company or
any other Person be required to recognize a Person exercising Dissent Rights
unless such Person is the registered holder of those Common Shares in respect
of which such rights are sought to be exercised. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(b)For greater certainty, in no case shall the Parent, the Purchaser,
the Company or any other Person be required to recognize Dissenting
Shareholders as holders of Common Shares in respect of which Dissent Rights
have been validly exercised after the completion of the transfer under Section
3.3(h), and the names of such Dissenting Shareholders shall be removed from
the registers of holders of the Common Shares in respect of which Dissent
Rights have been validly exercised at the same time as the event described in
Section 3.3(h) occurs. In addition to \t\t

by the Common Shares held by such holders against the Arrangement
Resolution. \t\t

Time represented one or more outstanding Common Shares or Company Compensation
Options that was exchanged pursuant to Section 3.3, is lost, stolen or

certificate, the Consideration to which such Person is entitled in respect of
the Common Shares or Compensation Option Exchange Shares represented by such
lost, stolen, or destroyed certificate pursuant to Section 3.3 deliverable in
accordance with such Person's Letter of Transmittal and Election Form. When
authorizing such issuances in exchange for any lost, stolen or destroyed
certificate, the Person to whom consideration is to be issued will, as a
condition precedent to the issuance thereof, give a bond satisfactory to the
Parent, the Purchaser and the Depositary (acting reasonably) in such sum as
the Parent may direct or otherwise indemnify the Parent, the Purchaser and the

applicable, shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from any consideration
otherwise payable or otherwise deliverable to any Company Securityholders
under the Plan of Arrangement (including, without limitation, any amounts
payable pursuant to Article 4) such amounts as the Purchaser, the Parent, the
Company or the Depositary, as applicable, determines, acting reasonably, are
required or permitted to be deducted and withheld from such consideration
under the Tax Act, the United States Internal Revenue Code of 1986 or any
provision of any other Law. To the extent that consideration is so withheld,
such consideration shall be treated for all purposes hereof as having been
paid to the Company Securityholders in respect of which such deduction,
withholding and/or remittance was made; provided that such consideration is
actually remitted to the appropriate Governmental Entity. To the extent that
the amount required to be deducted or withheld from any payment to an affected
Company Securityholder exceeds the cash component, if any, of the Initial
Consideration otherwise payable to such holder, the Parent, the Purchaser, the
Company or the Depositary, as applicable, may sell or otherwise dispose of
such portion of the Initial Consideration or other amount otherwise payable to
such affected Company Securityholder in the form of Parent Shares as is
necessary to provide sufficient funds to enable the payor to comply with such
deduction and/or withholding requirements. To the extent that the Initial
Consideration is entirely in the form of Cash Consideration, any shortfall in
the amount required to be deducted or withheld shall be forthwith paid by such
affected Company Securityholder. \t\t

outstanding prior to the Effective Time, (b) the rights and obligations of the
Company Securityholders, the Company, the Parent, the Purchaser, the
Depositary and any transfer agent or other depositary therefor in relation
thereto, shall be solely as provided for in this Plan of Arrangement, and (c)
all actions, causes of action, claims or proceedings (actual or contingent and
whether or not previously asserted) based on or in any way relating to any
Common Shares, Company Options, Company DSUs, Company RSUs and Company
Compensation Options shall be deemed to have been settled, compromised,
released and determined without liability except as set forth in this Plan of

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(1)Organization and Qualification. The Company is a corporation duly
incorporated, validly existing and in good standing under the laws of the
jurisdiction of its incorporation and has all requisite power and authority to
own, lease and operate its assets and properties and conduct its business as
now owned and conducted. The Company is duly qualified, licensed or registered
to carry on business and is in good standing in each jurisdiction in which the
character of its assets and properties, owned, leased, licensed or otherwise
held, or the nature of its activities make such qualification, licensing or
registration necessary, and has all Authorizations required to own, lease and
operate its properties and assets and to conduct its business as now owned and
conducted, except for those Authorizations the absence of which do not result
in and would not be reasonably expected to result in, individually or in the
aggregate, any Material liability to the Company. Section 3.1(1) of the
Company Disclosure Letter lists the date of formation of the Company, each
state, province or other jurisdiction in which each Company is duly qualified
to do business as a foreign corporation and the date of such
qualification. \t\t

 \t\t

Company is accurately set out in Section 3.1(2)(a) of the Company Disclosure

incorporation, organization or formation, and (v) each state, province or
other jurisdiction in which such Subsidiary is duly qualified to do business
as a foreign corporation or Person and the date of such qualification, and,
other than as set out in Section 3.1(2)(a) of the Company Disclosure Letter,
the Company has no Subsidiaries or owns any security or other ownership
interest in any other Person. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(b)Each Subsidiary is a corporation, partnership, trust or limited
partnership, as the case may be, duly organized, validly existing and in good
standing under the laws of the jurisdiction of its incorporation, organization
or formation, as the case may be, and has all requisite corporate, trust or
partnership power and authority, as the case may be, to own, lease and operate
its properties and assets and to carry on its business as now being conducted,
except where the failure to be so organized, validly existing, qualified or in
good standing, or to have such power or authority, would not, individually or
in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to result in any Material liability
to the Company or any Subsidiary. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(c)Except as disclosed in Section 3.1(2)(c) of the Company Disclosure
Letter, the Company is, directly or indirectly, the registered and beneficial
owner of all of the outstanding common shares or other equity interests of
each of its Subsidiaries, free and clear of any Liens, all such shares or
other equity interests so owned by the Company have been validly issued and
are fully paid and non-assessable, as the case may be, and no such shares or
other equity interests have been issued in violation of any pre-emptive or
similar rights. Except for the shares or other equity interests owned by the

kind in any other Person. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(3)Corporate Authorization. The Company has the requisite corporate
power and authority to enter into and perform its obligations under this
Agreement. The execution, delivery and performance by the Company of its
obligations under this Agreement and the consummation of the Arrangement and
the other transactions contemplated hereby have been duly authorized by all
necessary corporate action on the part of the Company and no other corporate
proceedings on the part of the Company are necessary to authorize this
Agreement or the consummation of the Arrangement and the other transactions
contemplated hereby other than approval by the Company Shareholders in the
manner required by the Interim Order, Law and approval by the Court. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(4)Execution and Binding Obligation. This Agreement has been duly
executed and delivered by the Company, and constitutes a legal, valid and
binding agreement of the Company enforceable against it in accordance with its
terms subject only to any limitation under bankruptcy, insolvency or other
Laws affecting the enforcement of creditors' rights generally and the
discretion that a court may exercise in the granting of equitable remedies
such as specific performance and injunction. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(5)Governmental Authorization. The execution, delivery and performance
by the Company of its obligations under this Agreement and the consummation of
the Arrangement and the other transactions contemplated hereby do not require

compliance with all terms and conditions of employment and all Laws respecting
employment, including pay equity, accessibility, wages, hours of work,

subject to any claim for wrongful dismissal, constructive dismissal or any
other tort claim, actual or, to the knowledge of the Company, threatened, or
any litigation actual, or to the knowledge of the Company, threatened,

or termination of engagement of Independent Contractors. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(e)The Company has not and is not engaged in any unfair labour
practice and no unfair labour practice complaint, grievance or arbitration
proceeding is pending, or to the knowledge of the Company, threatened against
the Company. No labour strike, lock-out, slowdown or work stoppage is pending
or to the knowledge of the Company, threatened against or directly affecting
the Company and no such event has occurred in the last two years. No
Governmental Entity has issued a judgment, order, decree or finding with
respect to the labour or employment practices (including practices relating to
discrimination, wage payments, recordkeeping, employment classification and
immigration) of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(f)To Company's knowledge, no executive Employee or Independent

understandings with Independent Contractors comply with the Federal Leasing

bona fide agreement whereby such individuals are independent contractors to,
and are not employees of, the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, and there is

or before any Governmental Entity that challenges (1) the Company's or any of
its Subsidiaries' compliance with any Laws relating to the retention or
classification of independent contractors, (2) the independent contractor

(iii) other understandings or arrangements pertaining to any Independent

plans, funds, contracts, programs, policies, trusts, funds, policies,

former directors of the Company, Company Employees or former Company
Employees, which are maintained, sponsored or funded by the Company, whether
written or oral, funded or unfunded, insured or self-insured, registered or
unregistered in respect of which the Company may have any liability contingent
or otherwise, other than benefit plans established by statute (collectively,
the "Employee Plans"). \t\t

 \t\t

required to be included in the Company Data Room pursuant to this provision.
The Company has also included in the Company Data Room, with respect to each
Employee Plan and to the extent applicable: (i) the most recent annual or
other reports filed with any Governmental Entity, (ii) the insurance contract
or other funding arrangement and all amendments thereto, (iii) the most recent
summary plan description, and all summaries of Material modification thereto,
(iv) the most recent determination letter, opinion letter or advisory letter
issued by the United States Internal Revenue Service or Canada Revenue Agency
or other regulatory authority and (v) copies of any Material notices, letters
or other correspondence from any Governmental Entity. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(c)No Employee Plan is or is intended to be a "registered pension
plan", a "deferred profit sharing plan", a "retirement compensation
arrangement", a "registered retirement savings plan", or a "tax-free savings
account" as such terms are defined in the Tax Act. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(d)The Company and its Subsidiaries and each of their respective ERISA
Affiliates, as applicable, has performed all obligations, whether arising by
operation of any Law or by contract, required to be performed by them in
connection with the Employee Plans, and to Company's knowledge, there have
been no defaults or violations by any other party to the Employee Plans,
except where such non-performance would not reasonably be expected to result
in greater than $50,000 in losses for the Company. The Company has made all
contributions and paid all premiums in respect of each Employee Plan in a
timely fashion in accordance with Law and the terms of each Employee
Plan. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(e)Each of the Employee Plans has been operated and administered in
all Material respects in accordance with the documents and instruments
governing the Employee Plan and applicable Law. All Material reports and
filings with Governmental Entities required in connection with each Employee
Plan have been timely filed or furnished in accordance with applicable Law.
All Material disclosures and notices required by Law or Employee Plan
provisions to be given to participants and beneficiaries in connection with
each Employee Plan have been properly and timely furnished in accordance with
applicable Law. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(f)Other than routine claims for benefits, no Employee Plan is subject
to any pending action, investigation, examination, claim (including claims for
income taxes, interest, penalties, fines or excise taxes) or any other
proceeding initiated by any Person, and there exists no state of facts which
could reasonably be expected to give rise to any such action, investigation,
examination, claim or other proceeding. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(g)No insurance policy or any other agreement affecting any Employee
Plan requires or permits a retroactive increase in contributions, premiums or
other payments due thereunder. The level of insurance reserves under each
Employee Plan which provides group benefits and contemplates the holding of
such reserves is reasonable and sufficient to provide for all incurred but
unreported claims. \t\t

for the proper administration of each Employee Plan. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(l)Each of the Employee Plans intended to be qualified under section
401(a) of the U.S. Tax Code: (i) satisfies the requirements of such Section;

States Internal Revenue Service for which a separate determination letter is
not required, or has received a favorable determination letter from the United
States Internal Revenue Service regarding such qualified status; (iii) has
been amended to the extent required by applicable Laws; and (iv) has not been
otherwise amended or operated in a way which would adversely affect such
qualified status. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(m)None of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or any of their
respective ERISA Affiliates, as applicable, contributes to or has any
obligation to contribute to, or has at any time within the last six years

entirety as of the Effective Date without any liability except as to benefits
accrued thereunder prior to such amendment. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(o)In connection with the consummation of the transaction contemplated
by this Agreement, no payments, acceleration of vesting or benefits, or
provisions of other rights have or will be made under this Agreement, under
any agreement, plan or other program contemplated herein or under the Employee
Plans that, in the aggregate, would result in the imposition of the loss of
deduction imposed under Section 280G of the U.S. Tax Code (determined without
regard to the exceptions contained in Sections 280G(b)(4) and 280G(b)(5) of
the U.S. Tax Code) or the excise tax under Section 4999 of the U.S. Tax Code,
whether or not some other subsequent action or event would be required to
cause such payment, acceleration, or provision to be triggered. \t\t

or other retiree fringe benefits to any person, and none of the Company or any
of its Subsidiaries or any of their respective Affiliates is contractually or
otherwise obligated (whether or not in writing) to provide any person with
life insurance or medical benefits upon retirement or termination of
employment, other than as required by the provisions of Sections 601 through
608 of ERISA and Section 4980B of the U.S. Tax Code and the regulations
promulgated thereunder, or under the applicable employment standards
legislation. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(q)Each Employee Plan that is a "nonqualified deferred compensation"
arrangement under Section 409A of the U.S. Tax Code complies with the
requirements of such Section, and no service provider is entitled to a gross-
up or similar payment for any Tax or interest that may be due under such
Section. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(r)No act, omission or transaction of or by the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries (or, to the Company's knowledge, of any other Person) has

liability damages under Section 409 of ERISA, (b) a civil penalty assessed
pursuant to Section 502 of ERISA, (c) a Tax imposed pursuant to Chapter 43 of

consent decree with any present or former Company Employee, employee
representative or other Person, including any Governmental Entity, relating to
claims in respect of employment or labor practices and policies (including
practices relating to discrimination, wage payments, employment standards, pay
equity, privacy, accessibility, occupational health and safety, recordkeeping,

of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement does not and will not
(either alone or upon the occurrence of any additional or subsequent events)
i) require the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or any of their ERISA
Affiliates to make a larger contribution to, or pay greater compensation,
payments or benefits under, any Employee Plan that it otherwise would in the
absence of the execution and delivery of this Agreement or the consummation of
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or ii) create or give rise to
any additional vested rights or service credits under any Employee Plan. \t\t

None of the Company or its Subsidiaries has received a refund to which it was
not entitled. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(c)Except as set forth in Section 3.1(42)(c) of the Company Disclosure
Letter, no litigation, audits, investigations, proposed adjustments,
