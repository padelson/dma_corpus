(a) _Commencement of the Offer_. Provided that this Agreement shall not
have been terminated in accordance with _ARTICLE IX_ , as promptly as
practicable after the date of this Agreement but in no event more than ten
(10) Business Days after the date of this Agreement (subject to the Company
having timely provided any information required to be provided by it pursuant
to _Sections 1.1(e)_ and _1.2(b)_ ), Merger Sub shall (and Parent shall cause

Act) the Offer to purchase any and all of the outstanding Shares (other than
Shares to be cancelled pursuant to _Sections 3.1(a)(i)_ and _3.1(a)(ii)_

the Offer Price, net to the holder of such Share in cash, without interest and
subject to any withholding of Tax in accordance with _Section 3.3(e)_ all on
the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement.

  



  

(b) _Terms and Conditions of the Offer_. The obligations of Merger Sub to
(and of Parent to cause Merger Sub to) accept for purchase, and pay for, any
Shares validly tendered (and not validly withdrawn) pursuant to the Offer
shall be subject to the prior satisfaction or waiver (to the extent permitted
under applicable Laws) of the conditions set forth in _Annex I_ (collectively,
the " _Offer Conditions_ "), and no other conditions. The Offer shall be made
by means of an offer to purchase (the " _Offer to Purchase_ ") that contains
the terms set forth in this Agreement, the Minimum Condition (as defined in
_Annex I_ ), the Termination Condition (as defined in _Annex I_ ) and the
other Offer Conditions. Merger Sub expressly reserves the right to (i)
increase the amount of cash constituting the Offer Price, (ii) waive any Offer
Condition (to the extent permitted under applicable Laws) and (iii) make any
other changes in the terms and conditions of the Offer not inconsistent with
the terms of this Agreement; _provided_ , _however_ , notwithstanding anything

limit the ability of Parent and Merger Sub to increase the cash consideration
payable in the Offer), (C) decrease the maximum number of Shares sought to be
purchased in the Offer, (D) impose conditions or requirements to the Offer in
addition to the Offer Conditions, (E) amend, modify or waive the Minimum
Condition, Termination Condition or the conditions set forth in clause (e) of
_Annex I_ , (F) otherwise amend or modify any of the other terms of the Offer
in a manner that adversely affects, or would reasonably be expected to
adversely affect any holder of Shares in its capacity as such, (G) withdraw or
terminate the Offer or accelerate, extend or otherwise change the Expiration
Date, in each case, except as provided in _Sections 1.1(c)_ or _1.1(d)_ or (H)
provide any "subsequent offering period" (or any extension thereof) within the
meaning of Rule 14d-11 promulgated under the Exchange Act.

(c) _Expiration and Extension of the Offer_. The expiration date and time
of the Offer, as the same may be extended from time to time in accordance with
the terms of this Agreement, is herein referred to as the " _Expiration Date_
". The initial Expiration Date shall be one minute after 11:59 p.m. Eastern
Time on the date that is twenty (20) Business Days (determined as set forth in
Rule 14d-1(g)(3) and Rule 14e-1(a) under the Exchange Act) following the date
on which Merger Sub commences the Offer, within the meaning of Rule 14d-2
under the Exchange Act (the " _Offer Commencement Date_ "). Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, but subject to the
Parties' respective termination rights under _ARTICLE IX_ : (i) if, as of the
then-scheduled Expiration Date, any Offer Condition is not satisfied (unless
such condition is waivable by Merger Sub or Parent and has been waived) Merger
Sub shall, and Parent shall cause Merger Sub to, extend the Offer for
additional periods of up to ten (10) Business Days per extension, to permit
such Offer Condition to be satisfied; and (ii) Merger Sub shall, and Parent
shall cause Merger Sub to, extend the Offer from time to time for any period
required by any Law, any interpretation or position of the SEC, the staff
thereof or the New York Stock Exchange applicable to the Offer; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that in no event shall Merger Sub (1) be required to extend the
Offer beyond the earlier to occur of (x) the valid termination of this
Agreement in accordance with _ARTICLE IX_ and (y) the End Date (such earlier
occurrence, the " _Extension Deadline_ ") or (2) be permitted to extend the
Offer beyond the Extension Deadline without the prior written consent of the
Company.

  



  

(d) _Termination of Offer_. Nothing in this _Section 1.1_ shall be deemed
to impair, limit or otherwise restrict in any manner the right of the Company,
Parent or Merger Sub to terminate this Agreement pursuant to _ARTICLE IX_. In
the event that this Agreement is validly terminated pursuant to _ARTICLE IX_ ,
Merger Sub shall (and Parent shall cause Merger Sub to) promptly (and in no
event more than one (1) Business Day after such termination), irrevocably and
unconditionally terminate the Offer and shall not acquire any Shares pursuant
to the Offer. If the Offer is terminated in accordance with the terms of this
Agreement, Merger Sub shall promptly (and in no event more than one (1)
Business Day after such termination) return, and shall cause any depository
acting on behalf of Merger Sub to return, in accordance with applicable Laws,
all tendered Shares to the registered holders thereof.

(e) _Offer Documents_. As promptly as practicable on the Offer
Commencement Date, Parent and Merger Sub shall (i) file with the SEC, in
accordance with Exchange Act Rule 14d-3, a tender offer statement on Schedule
TO with respect to the Offer (together with any exhibits, amendments or
supplements thereto, the " _Offer Documents_ ") that will contain or
incorporate by reference the Offer to Purchase, form of the related letter of
transmittal and summary advertisement, (ii) make all deliveries, mailings and
telephonic notices required by Rule 14d-3 under the Exchange Act and (iii)
cause the Offer to Purchase and related documents to be disseminated to
holders of Shares as and to the extent required by applicable Laws. Parent and
Merger Sub agree that they shall cause the Offer Documents filed by either
Parent or Merger Sub with the SEC to (x) comply in all material respects with
the Exchange Act and other applicable Laws and (y) on the date first filed
with the SEC and on the date first disseminated to holders of Shares, not
contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material
fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the
statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made,
not misleading; _provided_ , _however_ , that no covenant is made by Parent or
Merger Sub with respect to information supplied by or on behalf of the Company
for inclusion or incorporation by reference in the Offer Documents. Each of
Parent, Merger Sub and the Company agrees to respond promptly to any comments
(including oral comments) of the SEC or its staff and to promptly correct any
information provided by it for use in the Offer Documents if and to the extent
that such information shall have become false or misleading in any material
respect, and Parent and Merger Sub further agree to take all steps necessary
to promptly cause the Offer Documents as so corrected to be filed with the SEC
and to be disseminated to holders of Shares, in each case as and to the extent
required by applicable Laws. The Company hereby consents to the inclusion of
the Company Board Recommendation in the Offer Documents. The Company shall
promptly furnish or otherwise make available to Parent and Merger Sub or
Parent's legal counsel all information concerning the Company and the
Company's stockholders that may be required or reasonably requested in
connection with any action contemplated by this _Section 1.1(e)_. The Company
and its counsel shall be given reasonable opportunity to review and comment on
the Offer Documents (including any response to any comments (including oral
comments) of the SEC or its staff with respect thereto) prior to the filing
thereof with the SEC, and Parent and Merger Sub shall give reasonable
consideration to any such comments made by the Company or its counsel. Parent
and Merger Sub agree to provide the Company and its counsel with any comments
(including oral comments) Parent, Merger Sub or their counsel may receive from
the SEC or its staff with respect to the Offer Documents promptly after
receipt of such comments (including oral comments).

  



  

(f) _Funds_. Without limiting the generality of _Section 7.13_ , Parent
shall cause to be provided to Merger Sub, on a timely basis, all of the funds
necessary to purchase all Shares that Merger Sub becomes obligated to purchase
pursuant to the Offer, and shall cause Merger Sub to perform, on a timely
basis, all of Merger Sub's obligations under this Agreement.

  



  

(g) _Adjustments_. If, between the date of this Agreement and the Offer
Acceptance Time, the outstanding Shares are changed into a different number or
class of shares by reason of any stock split, division or subdivision of
shares, stock dividend, reverse stock split, consolidation of shares,
reclassification, recapitalization or other similar transaction, then the
Offer Price shall be appropriately adjusted.

  



  

(h) _Acceptance_. Subject only to the satisfaction or, to the extent
waivable by Merger Sub or Parent, waiver by Merger Sub or Parent of each of
the Offer Conditions, Merger Sub shall (and Parent shall cause Merger Sub to)
(i) promptly, and in no event later than 9:00 a.m. Eastern Time one (1)
Business Day after the Expiration Date irrevocably accept for payment all
Shares tendered (and not validly withdrawn) pursuant to the Offer (the time of
such acceptance, the " _Offer Acceptance Time_ ") and (ii) as promptly as
practicable after the Offer Acceptance Time (and in any event within three (3)
Business Days) pay for such Shares.

agrees that it shall cause the Schedule 14D-9 to (x) comply in all material
respects with the Exchange Act and other applicable Laws and (y) on the date
first filed with the SEC and on the date first disseminated to holders of
Shares, not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state
any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make
the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were

same date as) the Offer Acceptance Time, except if the conditions set forth in
_ARTICLE VIII_ shall not be satisfied or, to the extent permitted by
applicable Laws, waived as of such date, in which case the Closing shall take
place on the second Business Day on which all conditions set forth in

SECTION 3.1 _Effect on Capital Stock_. At the Effective Time, by virtue
of the Merger and without any action on the part of the Company, Parent,
Merger Sub or the holders of any of the following securities:

  



  

(a) _Per Share_ _Merger Consideration_.

cease to exist, and no consideration shall be delivered in exchange therefor;

  



  

(ii) any Shares held immediately prior to the Effective Time by Parent,

(iii) except as provided in clauses (i) and (ii) above and subject to
_Section 3.1(b)_ , each Share outstanding immediately prior to the Effective
Time (other than any Dissenting Shares (as defined below), which shall have
only those rights set forth in _Section 3.4_ , and other than any Cancelled
Shares) shall be converted into the right to receive the Offer Price (the "
_Per Share Merger Consideration_ "), in each case without any interest
thereon, subject to any withholding of Taxes in accordance with _Section
3.3(e)_ ; and

  



  

(iv) each share of the common stock, $0.01 par value per share, of Merger
Sub then outstanding shall be converted into one share of common stock of the

outstanding Shares are changed into a different number or class of shares by
reason of any stock split, division or subdivision of shares, stock dividend,

SECTION 3.2 _Treatment of Company Equity Awards_.

  



  

(a) _Treatment of Options_. Except as may otherwise be agreed to in
writing between a holder of a Company Option (as defined below) and Parent,
each option to purchase Shares that is outstanding and unexercised immediately
prior to the Effective Time that was granted pursuant to the Company Stock
Plan, whether vested or unvested (each, a " _Company Option_ "), shall, as of
the Effective Time, become fully vested (to the extent not already vested) and
be cancelled and converted into the right to receive an amount in cash
(without interest) equal to the product obtained by multiplying (i) the
excess, if any, of the Per Share Merger Consideration over the exercise price
per Share of such Company Option by (ii) the total number of Shares subject to
such Company Option immediately prior to the Effective Time. The Surviving
Corporation or one of its subsidiaries, as applicable, shall pay to the
holders of Company Options the cash amounts described in the immediately
preceding sentence, less such amounts as are required to be withheld or
deducted under the Code or any provision of state, local or foreign Law with
respect to the making of such payment, within seven calendar days following
the Effective Time. Any Company Option with an exercise price per Share that
is equal to or greater than the Per Share Merger Consideration shall be
cancelled for no consideration as of the Effective Time.

  



  

(b) _Treatment of_ _Company Restricted Shares_. Each Share granted
subject to vesting or other lapse restrictions pursuant to the Company Stock
Plans that is outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (each, a "
_Company Restricted Share_ "), shall, as of the Effective Time, become fully
vested (without regard to the satisfaction of any vesting or other lapse
restriction, including any performance condition) and be cancelled and
converted into the right to receive an amount in cash (without interest) equal
to the Per Share Merger Consideration. The Surviving Corporation or one of its
subsidiaries, as applicable, shall pay to the holders of Company Restricted
Shares the cash amounts described in the immediately preceding sentence, less
such amounts as are required to be withheld or deducted under the Code or any
provision of state, local or foreign Law relating to Tax with respect to the
making of such payment, within seven calendar days following the Effective
Time.

  



  

(c) _Treatment of_ _Company ESPP_. As soon as practicable following the
date of this Agreement, the Company shall take all actions with respect to the
Company ESPP that are necessary to provide that (i) no participant may
increase the percentage amount of his or her payroll deduction election from
that in effect as of the date of this Agreement for the offering period under
the Company ESPP that is in effect as of the date of this Agreement (the "
_Current Offering Period_ "); and (ii) no new offering period will be
commenced under the Company ESPP following the date of this Agreement. If the
Effective Time occurs prior to the end of the Current Offering Period, then
there shall be no purchases of Common Stock under the Company ESPP for such
Current Offering Period and the Company ESPP optionholders' accumulated
payroll deduction for the Current Offering Period shall be returned to the
Company ESPP optionholders without interest.

  



  

(d) _Corporate Actions_. At or prior to the Effective Time, the Company,
the Board of Directors of the Company and the Compensation Committee of the
Board of Directors of the Company, as applicable, shall adopt any resolutions
and take any actions which are necessary to effectuate the provisions of this
_Section 3.2_ and to cause the Company Stock Plans and all rights thereunder
to terminate as of the Effective Time.

(e) On the Closing Date, Parent will deposit (or cause to be deposited)
with the Company, by wire transfer of immediately available funds, the
aggregate amount owed to holders of Company Options and Company Restricted
Shares (including the employer portion of any applicable payroll taxes).

  



  

SECTION 3.3 _Surrender of Shares_.

  



  

(a) _Depository Agent and_ _Paying Agent_. Prior to the Offer Acceptance
Time, Parent or Merger Sub shall enter into an agreement in form and substance
reasonably acceptable to each of the Company and Parent with a depository
agent and a paying agent selected by Parent with the Company's prior written
approval, which approval shall not be unreasonably conditioned, withheld or
delayed, to act as agent for the stockholders of the Company in connection
with the Offer and the Merger for the holders of Shares to receive the
aggregate Offer Price to which the holders of such Shares shall become
entitled to pursuant to _Section 1.1(b)_ (the " _Depository Agent_ ") and for
the holder of Shares to receive the aggregate Per Share Merger Consideration
to which the holders of shall become entitled pursuant to _Section 3.1(a)_
(the " _Paying Agent_ "). Substantially concurrently with the Offer Acceptance
Time, Parent shall deposit, or cause to be deposited, with the Depository
Agent, a cash amount sufficient to make the payment of the aggregate Offer
Price payable pursuant to _Section 1.1(h_ ). Promptly after (and in no event
later than the second Business Day after) the Closing Date, Parent shall
deposit, or shall cause to be deposited, with the Paying Agent cash sufficient
to pay the aggregate Per Share Merger Consideration payable pursuant to
_Section 3.1_ (together with the amount deposited pursuant the immediately
preceding sentence, the " _Exchange Fund_ "). With respect to any Dissenting
Shares, Parent shall not be required to deposit or cause to be deposited with
the Paying Agent funds sufficient to pay the Per Share Merger Consideration
that would be payable in respect of such Dissenting Shares if such Dissenting
Shares were not Dissenting Shares. The Exchange Fund shall not be used for any
purpose other than to pay the aggregate Offer Price in the Offer and the
aggregate Per Share Merger Consideration in the Merger. The Paying Agent shall
invest the Exchange Fund as reasonably directed by Parent; _provided_ that
such investments shall be in obligations of or guaranteed by the United States
of America, in commercial paper obligations rated A-1 or P-1 or better by
Moody's Investors Service, Inc. or Standard and Poor's Corporation,
respectively, in certificates of deposit, bank repurchase agreements or
banker's acceptances of commercial banks with capital exceeding $1 billion, or
in money market funds having a rating in the highest investment category
granted by a recognized credit rating agency at the time of acquisition or a
combination of the foregoing and, in any such case, no such instrument shall
have a maturity exceeding three months. To the extent that there are losses
with respect to such investments, or the Exchange Fund diminishes for other
reasons below the level required to make prompt cash payment of the aggregate
Per Share Merger Consideration as contemplated hereby, Parent shall promptly
replace or restore, or cause to be replaced or restored, the cash in the
Exchange Fund lost through such investments or other events so as to ensure
that the Exchange Fund is at all times maintained at a level sufficient to
make such cash payments. Any interest and other income resulting from such
investment shall become a part of the Exchange Fund, and any amounts in excess
of the amounts payable under _Section_ _3_ _.1(a)_ shall be promptly returned
to Parent or the Surviving Corporation, as requested by Parent. The funds
deposited with the Paying Agent pursuant to this _Section_ _3_ _.3(a)_ shall
not be used for any purpose other than as contemplated by this _Section_ _3_
_.3(a)_.

(b) _Exchange Procedures_.

  



  

(i) _Transmittal Materials_. Promptly after the Effective Time (and in
any event within two Business Days thereafter), the Surviving Corporation
shall cause the Paying Agent to mail or otherwise provide to each former
holder of record of a certificate or certificates that immediately prior to
the Effective Time represented outstanding Shares, if any (" _Certificates_
"), and, if required by the Paying Agent, each former holder of record of
Shares held in book-entry form (" _Book-Entry Shares_ ") (other than holders
of Cancelled Shares and Dissenting Shares) (A) transmittal materials,
including a letter of transmittal in customary form as agreed by the Parties,
specifying that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the
Certificates will pass, only upon proper delivery of the Certificates to the
Paying Agent or, with respect to Book-Entry Shares, only upon delivery of
evidence, if any, of the book-entry transfer of Book-Entry Shares as the
Paying Agent may reasonably request, such transmittal materials to be in such
form and have such other provisions as Parent and the Company may reasonably
agree, and (B) instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the
Certificates or Book-Entry Shares, as applicable, in exchange for the Per
Share Merger Consideration.

  



  

(ii) _Certificates_. Upon surrender of Certificates (or effective
affidavits of loss in lieu thereof and delivery of a bond in a reasonable
amount, if reasonably required, in each case pursuant to this _Section
3.3(b)(ii)_ ) to the Paying Agent, together with the transmittal materials,
duly completed and validly executed in accordance with the instructions
thereto (and such other customary documents as may be required by the Paying
Agent) each holder of record of one or more Certificates, if any, shall be
entitled to receive, and Parent shall cause the Paying Agent to pay and
deliver as promptly as reasonably practicable after the Effective Time, a cash
amount in immediately available funds (after giving effect to any required Tax
withholdings as provided in _Section 3.3(e)_ ) equal to the product obtained
by _multiplying_ __ (A) the number of Shares represented by such Certificates
by (B) the Per Share Merger Consideration, and the Certificates so surrendered
shall immediately be cancelled. No interest will be paid or accrued on any
amount payable upon due surrender of the Certificates. If any Certificate
shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, then upon (i) the making of an
affidavit of that fact by the Person claiming such Certificate to be lost,
stolen or destroyed, and (ii) if reasonably required by the Surviving
Corporation, an indemnity bond reasonable in amount, the Paying Agent shall
pay in respect of such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate the Per Share
Merger Consideration to which the holder thereof is entitled pursuant to
_Section 3.1(a)_.

  



  

(iii) _Book-Entry Shares_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
contained in this Agreement, any holder of Book-Entry Shares will not be
required to deliver a Certificate to receive the Per Share Merger
Consideration. In lieu thereof, each holder of record of one or more Book-
Entry Shares (other than Cancelled Shares and Dissenting Shares) shall upon
receipt by the Paying Agent of evidence, if any, of the book-entry transfer of
Book-Entry Shares as the Paying Agent may reasonably request be entitled to
receive, together with the transmittal materials, duly completed and validly
executed in accordance with the instructions thereto (and such other documents
as may customarily be required by the Paying Agent), and Parent shall cause
the Paying Agent to pay and deliver as promptly as reasonably practicable
after the Effective Time, a cash amount in immediately available funds (after
giving effect to any required Tax withholdings as provided in _Section 3.3(e)_
) equal to the product obtained by _multiplying_ __ (A) the number of Shares
represented by such Book-Entry Shares by (B) the Per Share Merger
Consideration, and the Book-Entry Shares so surrendered shall immediately be
cancelled. No interest will be paid or accrued on any amount payable upon due
surrender of the Book-Entry Shares.

  



  

 

 

 

11

   

 



 

 

 

  



  

(iv) _Unrecorded Transfers; Other Payments_. In the event of a transfer
of ownership of Shares that is not registered in the transfer records of the
Company or if payment of the Per Share Merger Consideration is to be made to a
Person other than the Person in whose name the surrendered Certificates is
registered, a check for any cash to be exchanged upon due surrender of the
Certificates may be issued to such transferee or other Person if the
Certificates formerly representing such Shares so surrendered are properly
endorsed or otherwise in proper form and accompanied by all documents required
to evidence and effect such transfer and to evidence that any applicable
transfer or other similar Taxes have been paid or are not applicable. Payment
of the Per Share Merger Consideration with respect to Book-Entry Shares will
only be made to the Person in whose name such Book-Entry Shares are
registered.

  



  

(v) Until surrendered as contemplated by this _Section 3.3(b)_ , each
Certificate and Book-Entry Share (other than Cancelled Shares and Dissenting
Shares) shall be deemed at any time after the Effective Time to represent only
the right to receive upon such surrender (together, if applicable, with a
letter of transmittal, duly completed and validly executed in accordance with
the instructions thereto, and such other documents as may reasonably be
required pursuant to such instructions (as applicable)) the applicable Per
Share Merger Consideration as contemplated by this _ARTICLE III_. The
Surviving Corporation shall pay all charges and expenses, including those of
the Paying Agent, in connection with the exchange of Shares for the Per Share
Merger Consideration.

  



  

(c) _Termination of Exchange Fund_. Any portion of the Exchange Fund
(including the proceeds of any investments thereof) that remains unclaimed by
the former holders of Shares for 12 months after the Effective Time shall be
delivered to the Surviving Corporation upon demand. Any holder of Certificates
or Book-Entry Shares (other than Cancelled Shares and Dissenting Shares) who
has not theretofore complied with this _ARTICLE III_ shall thereafter be
entitled to look to the Surviving Corporation for payment of the Per Share
Merger Consideration (after giving effect to any required Tax withholdings as
provided in _Section 3.3(e)_ ) upon delivery of evidence of Certificates or
Book-Entry Shares acceptable to the Surviving Corporation, without any
interest thereon in accordance with the provisions set forth in _Section
3.3(b)_ , and the Surviving Corporation shall remain liable for (subject to
applicable abandoned property, escheat or other similar Laws) payment of such
holder's claim for the Per Share Merger Consideration payable upon due
surrender of its Certificates or Book-Entry Shares. Notwithstanding anything
to the contrary herein, none of the Surviving Corporation, Parent, the
Company, the Paying Agent or any other Person shall be liable to any former
holder of Shares for any amount properly delivered to a public official
pursuant to applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar Laws. Any
amounts remaining unclaimed by such holders immediately prior to such time at
which such amounts would otherwise escheat to or become property of any
Governmental Entity shall become, to the extent permitted by applicable Law,
the property of the Surviving Corporation, free and clear of all claims of
interest of any Person previously entitled thereto.

  



  

 

 

 

12

   

 



 

 

 

  



  

(d) _Transfers_. From and after the Effective Time, the stock transfer
books of the Company shall be closed, and there shall be no transfers on the
stock transfer books of the Surviving Corporation of the Shares that were
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time. Until surrendered as
contemplated by _Section 3.3_ _(b)_ , each Certificate or Book-Entry Share
shall, from and after the Effective Time, represent only the right to receive
the Per Share Merger Consideration (without interest and less applicable
withholding Taxes) and will not evidence any interest in, or any right to
exercise the rights of a stockholder or other equityholder of the Company or
the Surviving Corporation. If, after the Effective Time, any evidence of a
Certificate or Book-Entry Share is presented, and acceptable, to the Surviving
Corporation, Parent or the Paying Agent for transfer, subject to compliance
with the procedures set forth in this _ARTICLE III_ , it shall be cancelled
and exchanged for the cash amount in immediately available funds to which the
holder thereof is entitled pursuant to _Section 3.1(a)_ (without interest and
less applicable withholding Taxes). The Per Share Merger Consideration paid
upon surrender of Certificates or receipt by the Paying Agent of an "agent's
message", if applicable, in the case of Book-Entry Shares in accordance with
the terms of this _ARTICLE III_ shall be deemed to have been paid in full
satisfaction of all rights pertaining to the Shares formerly represented by
such Certificates or Book-Entry Shares, as applicable.

  



  

(e) _Withholding Rights_. Each of the Depository Agent, the Paying Agent,
Parent and the Surviving Corporation (and any agent thereof) shall be entitled
to deduct and withhold from the consideration otherwise payable pursuant to
this Agreement to any holder of Shares, Company Options, and Company
Restricted Shares such amounts as it is required to deduct and withhold with
respect to the making of such payment under the Code or any other applicable
state, local or foreign Tax Law (as reasonably determined by the Depository
Agent, Paying Agent, Parent or the Surviving Corporation (or any agent
thereof)). To the extent that amounts are so deducted or withheld by the
Depository Agent, Paying Agent, Parent or the Surviving Corporation (or any
agent thereof), as the case may be, such deducted or withheld amounts (i)
shall be remitted by the Depository Agent, Paying Agent, Parent or the
Surviving Corporation (or any agent thereof), as applicable, to the applicable
Governmental Entity, and (ii) shall be treated for all purposes of this
Agreement as having been paid to the holder of Shares, Company Options, and
Company Restricted Shares (as the case may be) in respect of which such
deduction and withholding was made by the Depository Agent, Paying Agent,
Parent or the Surviving Corporation (or any agent thereof), as the case may
be. All compensatory amounts subject to payroll reporting and withholding
payable pursuant to or as contemplated by this Agreement will be paid through
the applicable payroll system in accordance with applicable payroll
procedures, without regard to any deferral potentially available under the
CARES Act.

  



  

SECTION 3.4 _Appraisal Rights_. Notwithstanding anything in this
Agreement to the contrary, any Shares that are issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than any Cancelled Shares) that
are held by stockholders of the Company who are entitled to appraisal rights
under Section 262 of the DGCL and have properly exercised and perfected their
respective demands for appraisal of such Shares in the time and manner
provided in Section 262 of the DGCL and, as of the Effective Time, have
neither effectively withdrawn nor lost their rights to such appraisal and
payment under the DGCL (collectively, " _Dissenting Shares_ ") shall not be
converted into or represent the right to receive the Per Share Merger
Consideration as provided in _Section 3.1(a)_ , unless and until such Person
shall have effectively withdrawn or otherwise lost or failed to perfect such
Person's right to appraisal or payment under the DGCL or a court of competent
jurisdiction determines that such holder is not entitled to the relief
provided by Section 262 of the DGCL, at which time such Shares shall be
treated as if they had been converted into and become exchangeable for the
right to receive, as of the Effective Time, the Per Share Merger Consideration
as provided in _Section 3.1(a)_ , upon surrender of the Certificates or Book-
Entry Shares representing such Shares, without interest and after giving
effect to any required Tax withholdings pursuant to _Section 3.3(e)_ and such
Shares shall not be deemed Dissenting Shares, and such holder thereof shall
cease to have any other rights with respect to such Shares. Each Dissenting
Share shall be deemed to no longer be outstanding, shall automatically be
canceled and extinguished and shall cease to exist at the Effective Time. Each
holder of Dissenting Shares shall cease to have any rights with respect to the
Dissenting Shares, other than the right to receive the payment of the fair
value of such Dissenting Shares in accordance with the provisions of, and as
provided by, Section 262 of the DGCL with respect to such Dissenting Shares
unless and until such Person shall have effectively withdrawn or otherwise
lost or failed to perfect such Person's right to appraisal or payment under
the DGCL or a court of competent jurisdiction determines that such holder is
not entitled to the relief provided by Section 262 of the DGCL. The Company
shall give Parent prompt written notice of any written demands for appraisal
or withdrawals of such demands, and any other instruments served pursuant to
applicable Law that are received by the Company relating to stockholders'
rights of appraisal. The Company shall not, except with the prior written
consent of Parent, and prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall not, except
with the prior written consent of the Company, make any payment with respect
to any demands for appraisal or offer to settle or compromise, or settle or
compromise or otherwise negotiate, any such demands, or approve any withdrawal
of any such demands, or waive any failure to timely deliver a written demand
for appraisal or otherwise to comply with the provisions under Section 262 of
the DGCL, or agree to do any of the foregoing.

SECTION 3.5 _Adjustments_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
herein, in the event that the number of Shares or securities convertible or
exchangeable into or exercisable for Shares issued and outstanding after the
date hereof and prior to the Effective Time shall have been changed into a
different number of Shares or securities or a different class as a result of a
reclassification, stock split (including a reverse stock split), combination,
stock dividend or distribution, recapitalization, subdivision, merger, issuer
tender or exchange offer, or other similar transaction, then the Per Share
Merger Consideration shall be equitably adjusted to provide to Parent and the
holders of Shares, Company Options, and Company Restricted Shares the same
economic effect as contemplated by this Agreement prior to such event;
_provided_ that nothing in this _Section 3.5_ shall be construed to permit the
Company, any subsidiary of the Company or any other Person to take any action
that is otherwise prohibited by the terms of this Agreement.

  



  

 **ARTICLE IV 
  
 REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF THE COMPANY **

  



  

The Company hereby represents and warrants to Parent and Merger Sub as of the

forms, reports, statements, certificates and other documents filed since the

"). As of their respective SEC filing dates, or, if amended or superseded by a

periods involved (except as may be indicated in the notes thereto) and fairly
present in all material respects the consolidated financial position of the
Company and its subsidiaries at the respective dates thereof (taking into
account the notes thereto) and the consolidated statements of operations, cash
flows and changes in equity for the periods indicated. The unaudited
consolidated financial statements of the Company and its subsidiaries

defined in paragraphs (e) and (f), respectively, of Rule 13a-15 under the
Exchange Act) as required by Rules 13a-15 and 15d-15 of the Exchange Act. Such
disclosure controls and procedures are effective to ensure that material
information required to be disclosed by the Company is recorded and reported
on a timely basis to the individuals responsible for the preparation of the
Company's filings with the SEC and other public disclosure documents. The
Company's management has completed an assessment of the effectiveness of the
Company's internal controls over financial reporting in compliance with the
requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act for the years ended
December 31, 2018 and December 31, 2019, and such assessment concluded that
such controls were effective. Based on the Company's management's most
recently completed evaluation of the Company's internal control over financial
reporting prior to the date hereof, the Company has not identified (i) any
"significant deficiencies" or "material weaknesses" in the system of internal
control over financial reporting utilized by the Company and its subsidiaries
that has not been subsequently remediated or (ii) any fraud that involves the
Company's management or other employees who have a significant role in the
preparation of financial statements or the internal control over financial
reporting utilized by the Company and its subsidiaries. Since the Applicable

officer have disclosed, based on their evaluation of internal control over
financial reporting, to the Company's auditors and the audit committee of the

made aware of "significant deficiencies," "material weaknesses" or fraud
referred to in clauses (i) or (ii) above. Since the Applicable Date, there

case, which have not resulted from or arisen out of, and do not relate to, any
breach or violation of, or default under, any Material Contract, License or
applicable Law; (iii) for liabilities or obligations which have been
discharged or paid in full prior to the date of this Agreement; (iv) for

expenses and the refinancing of certain outstanding indebtedness of the
Company and (b) the executed commitment letter, dated as of the date hereof,
from the Guarantor (including all exhibits, schedules and annexes thereto, the

has committed, subject to the terms and conditions set forth therein, to

and all commitment fees or other fees in connection with the Financing
Commitments that are payable on or prior to the date hereof. As of the date

Sub, each of the other parties thereto. There are no conditions precedent or
other contingencies related to the funding of the full amount of the

delivered to the Company on or prior to the date hereof. As of the date
hereof, assuming the accuracy of the representations and warranties in

breach on the part of Parent or Merger Sub or, to the knowledge of Parent or
Merger Sub, any other party thereto under any of the Financing Commitments,
(ii) constitute a failure to satisfy a condition precedent on the part of
Parent or Merger Sub or any other party thereto under the Financing
Commitments or (iii) result in any portion of the Financing Commitments being

obligations under this Agreement that Parent or Merger Sub obtain the
Financing or any other financing for or related to any of the transactions
contemplated hereby.

agreed that any determination or action by the Board of Directors of the
Company made in accordance with _Section 7.1(b)_ or _Section 7.1(c)_ shall not
be deemed to be a breach or violation of this _Section 7.1(a)_. The Company
also agrees that immediately following the execution of this Agreement it
shall, and shall cause each of its subsidiaries and shall use its reasonable
best efforts to cause its and their Representatives to, cease any
solicitations, discussions or negotiations with any Person (other than the
Parties and their respective Representatives) in connection with an
Acquisition Proposal, in each case that exist as of the date hereof. The
Company also agrees that following the execution of this Agreement it will
promptly request each Person (other than the Parties and their respective
Representatives) that has in the past six (6) months prior to the date hereof
executed a confidentiality agreement in connection with its consideration of
an Acquisition Proposal to return or destroy all confidential information
furnished to such Person by or on behalf of it or any of its subsidiaries
prior to the date hereof and terminate access to any physical or electronic
data room maintained by or on behalf of the Company or any of its
subsidiaries. The Company shall promptly (and in any event within one Business
Day) notify, in writing, Parent of the receipt of any inquiry, proposal or
offer received after the date hereof that constitutes, or could reasonably be

confidentiality agreement (or any similar agreement) to which the Company or

_provided_ , that the Company may grant a waiver, amendment or release under
any confidentiality or standstill agreement to the extent necessary to allow
for a confidential Acquisition Proposal to be made to the Company or the Board
of Directors so long as the Board of Directors of the Company determines prior
to the grant of such waiver, amendment or release in good faith, after
consultation with outside legal counsel to the Company, that the failure of
the Board of Directors of the Company to take such action would be reasonably
likely to be inconsistent with its duties under applicable Law.

Acquisition Proposal would be inconsistent with its obligations under
applicable Law or under the Exchange Act;

  



  

(ii) prior to the Offer Acceptance Time, engaging in discussions with any
Person or group and their respective Representatives who has made an

Company's or any of its subsidiaries' properties, books and records and
providing information or data in response to a request therefor by a Person

any time prior to the Offer Acceptance Time, the Company's Board of Directors
determines in good faith, after consultation with its financial advisor(s) and
outside legal counsel, in response to an Acquisition Proposal that did not
result from a breach of this _Section 7.1_ , that such proposal constitutes a
Superior Proposal, the Company or its Board of Directors may, prior to the

Parent or Merger Sub), or publicly propose to withdraw (or modify in a manner
adverse to Parent or Merger Sub), the Company Board Recommendation, (2) adopt,

promulgated under the Exchange Act (or, if earlier, by the close of business
on the End Date) or (4) fail to include the Company Board Recommendation in
the Schedule 14D-9 when filed with the SEC or disseminated to the Company's
stockholders (any action described in this clause (A) being referred to as a "

action and containing the material terms and conditions of the Superior
Proposal that is the basis of the proposed action of the Board of Directors of
the Company (including the identity of the party making such Superior Proposal
and a written summary of any material terms and conditions communicated
orally), and shall include with such notice unredacted copies of the proposed
transaction agreement (if any) and copies of any other documents evidencing or
specifying the terms and conditions of such Acquisition Proposal, and (y) at

so terminate would be reasonably likely to be inconsistent with its fiduciary
duties under applicable Law. If requested by Parent, the Company will, and
will cause its subsidiaries to, and will use its reasonable best efforts to
cause its or their Representatives to, during the Notice Period, engage in
good faith negotiations with Parent and its Representatives to make such
adjustments in the terms and conditions of this Agreement so that such
Acquisition Proposal would cease to constitute a Superior Proposal.

contrary, if, at any time prior to the Offer Acceptance Time, the Company's
Board of Directors determines in good faith, in response to an Intervening

of any applicable waiting period; (ii) materially increase the risk of any
Governmental Entity seeking or entering an order prohibiting the consummation
of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement; or (iii) materially

information and materials of a Party to the other Party on an outside counsel-
only basis or directly to the applicable Governmental Entity while, to the
extent feasible, making a version in which the sensitive information has been
redacted available to the other Party. Materials provided to the other Party

consent of Parent, such consent not to be unreasonably withheld, delayed or
conditioned.

obtaining, any consents of any Governmental Entity necessary to consummate the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement or the expiration or termination
of any applicable waiting period; (ii) materially increase the risk of any
Governmental Entity seeking or entering an order prohibiting the consummation
of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement; (iii) materially increase

Governmental Entity in connection with the Merger or the other transactions
contemplated hereby or from any Person alleging that the consent of such

or the failure of such Party to obtain such consent would reasonably be
expected to be material to the Company, the Surviving Corporation or Parent,
(b) any Actions commenced or, to such Party's knowledge, threatened against,
relating to or involving or otherwise affecting such Party or any of its
subsidiaries which relate to the Merger or the other transactions contemplated
hereby, or (c) any fact, event or circumstance that occurs or exists that is
reasonably likely to result in any of the conditions set forth in _ARTICLE
VIII_ not being able to be satisfied; _provided_ that the delivery of any
notice pursuant to this _Section 7.3_ shall not (i) cure any breach of, or
non-compliance with, any other provision of this Agreement or (ii) limit the
remedies available to the Party receiving such notice. The Parties agree and
acknowledge that the Company's, on the one hand, and Parent's, on the other
hand, compliance or failure of compliance with this _Section 7.3_ shall not be
taken into account for purposes of determining whether the conditions referred
to in _Section 8.1_ or _Annex I_ shall have been satisfied with respect to
performance in all material respects with this _Section 7.3_.

  



  

 

 

 

55

afford Parent and its Representatives reasonable access, consistent with
applicable Law, during normal business hours to the Company's and its
subsidiaries' officers, employees, properties, books and records, as necessary
to facilitate consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, any such investigation or consultation shall be
conducted in such a manner as not to interfere unreasonably with the business
or operations of the Company or its subsidiaries or otherwise result in any
significant interference with the prompt and timely discharge by such
officers, employees and other authorized Representatives of their normal
duties and shall not include any invasive environmental sampling or testing.
Neither the Company nor any of its subsidiaries shall be required to provide
access or to disclose information where such access or disclosure would

judgment, decree or binding agreement entered into prior to the date of this
Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event that the Company does
not provide access or disclose information in reliance on the immediately
preceding sentence, it shall provide notice to Parent that it is withholding
such access or information and shall use its reasonable best efforts to
communicate, to the extent feasible, the applicable information in a way that
would not waive such privilege or violate the applicable Law, rule,
regulation, order, judgment, decree or binding agreement, including entering
into a joint defense agreement, common interest agreement or other similar
arrangement. All requests for information made pursuant to this _Section
7.4(a)_ shall be directed to the executive officer or other Person designated
by the Company.

things, reasonably necessary, proper or advisable on its part under applicable
Laws and rules and policies of the New York Stock Exchange to enable the
delisting by the Surviving Corporation of the Shares from the New York Stock

with respect to the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, including providing each other the opportunity to review and
comment upon any press release or other public announcement, and prior to

agreement with or rules of any national securities exchange or interdealer
quotation service or by the request of any Governmental Entity, in each case,
as determined in the good faith judgment of the Party proposing to make such
release (in which case, such Party shall not issue or cause the publication of
such press release or other public announcement without prior consultation
with the other Party). Notwithstanding the foregoing, Parent, Merger Sub and
their respective Affiliates may provide Ordinary Course communications
regarding this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby to existing
or prospective general and limited partners, equityholders, members, managers
and investors of any Affiliates of such Person, in each case, who are subject
to customary confidentiality restrictions to the extent consistent with prior
public disclosures by the Parties made in accordance with this _Section 7.6_.

  



  

SECTION 7.7 _Employee Benefits_.

  



  

(a) For at least 12 months following the Effective Time (the " _Benefit
Continuation Period_ "), Parent shall provide, or shall cause the Surviving
Corporation to provide, to each employee of the Company or its subsidiaries

Corporation or any subsidiary or Affiliate thereof (the " _Continuing
Employees_ "), with, for so long as such Continuing Employee continues
employment with the Surviving Corporation or any subsidiary or Affiliate

are substantially comparable in the aggregate to the broad-based employee
benefits (other than Excluded Benefits) that were provided to such Continuing
Employee immediately prior to the Effective Time or, if more favorable, that
are provided to similarly-situated employees of Parent. With respect to
Continuing Employees whose terms and conditions of employment are governed by
a collective bargaining agreement, the provisions of this _Section_ _7.7(a)_
shall not apply and the terms of such collective bargaining agreement shall
govern.

  



  

(b) From and after the Effective Time, Parent shall honor and assume, or
shall cause to be honored and assumed, the terms of all Company Plans (and any
compensation arrangement(s) adopted prior to the Effective Time as permitted
under _Section 6.1_ that would have been Company Plans had such arrangement(s)
been in effect as of the date of this Agreement) that remain in effect as of
the Effective Time in accordance with their terms.

  



  

 

 

 

57

   

 



 

 

 

  



  

(c) To the extent that Parent modifies any coverage or benefit plan in
which Continuing Employees participate, Parent or any of its subsidiaries
(including the Company and any subsidiaries thereof) shall use commercially
reasonable efforts to (i) waive or cause to be waived any pre-existing

eligibility waiting periods under any group health plans of Parent or its
Affiliates to be waived with respect to Continuing Employees and their
eligible dependents to the extent such conditions were inapplicable or waived
under a comparable Company Plans, (ii) give each Continuing Employee credit
for the plan year in which the Effective Time occurs towards applicable
deductibles and annual out-of-pocket limits for medical expenses incurred
prior to the Effective Time for which payment has been made and (iii) to the
extent that it would not result in a duplication of benefits and to the extent
that such service was recognized under a similar Company Plan, give each
Continuing Employee service credit for such Continuing Employee's employment
with the Company for purposes of eligibility to participate and vesting credit
(but excluding benefit accrual under any defined benefit pension plan) under
each applicable Parent benefit plan as if such service had been performed with
Parent; _provided_ that no such service credit shall be provided for purposes
of any Excluded Benefits.

  



  

(d) Following the Closing, Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation or
one of its subsidiaries to take all actions necessary to effectuate the
payments set forth on Section 7.7(d) of the Company Disclosure Letter.

any right to continue in the employ or service of Parent, the Surviving
Corporation or any Affiliate of Parent, or shall interfere with or restrict in
any way the rights of Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any Affiliate of
Parent, which rights are hereby expressly reserved, to discharge or terminate
the services of any Continuing Employee at any time for any reason whatsoever,
with or without cause or to amend or terminate any Company Plan, except to the
extent expressly provided otherwise in a written agreement between Parent, the
Surviving Corporation, the Company or any Affiliate of Parent and the
Continuing Employee or any severance, benefit or other applicable plan, policy
or program covering such Continuing Employee. Notwithstanding any provision in
this Agreement to the contrary, nothing in this _Section 7.7_ shall (i) be
deemed or construed to be the adoption or an amendment or other modification
of any Company Plan or other compensation or benefit plan, policy, program,
agreement or arrangement, (ii) prevent Parent, the Surviving Corporation or
any Affiliate of Parent from amending or terminating any Company Plan in
accordance with its terms or (iii) create any third-party rights in any
current or former service provider of the Company or its Affiliates (or any

SECTION 7.8 _Directors ' and Officers' Indemnification and Insurance_.

  



  

(a) From and after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation agrees
that it will indemnify and hold harmless each present and former director and
officer of the Company or any of its subsidiaries (in each case, to the extent
acting in such capacity) (the " _Indemnified Parties_ "), against any costs or
expenses (including reasonable attorneys' fees), judgments, fines, losses,
claims, damages, liabilities or awards paid in settlement incurred in
connection with any actual or threatened claim, action, suit, proceeding or
investigation, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative and
whether formal or informal (each, a " _Proceeding_ "), arising out of,
relating to or in connection with the fact that such Person is or was a
director or officer of the Company or any of its subsidiaries or any acts or
omissions occurring or alleged to occur prior to the Effective Time in such
Person's capacity as a director or officer of the Company, whether asserted or
claimed prior to, at or after the Effective Time, to the fullest extent that
the Company would have been permitted under Delaware Law and its Certificate
of Incorporation and Bylaws in effect on the date of this Agreement to
indemnify such Person (and the Surviving Corporation shall (and Parent shall
cause the Surviving Corporation to) advance expenses (including reasonable
legal fees and expenses) incurred in the defense of any Proceeding, including
any expenses incurred in successfully enforcing such Person's rights under
this _Section 7.8_ , regardless of whether indemnification with respect to or
advancement of such expenses is authorized under the Certificate of
Incorporation, the Bylaws or the certificate of incorporation and bylaws, or
equivalent organizational documents, of any subsidiary; _provided_ that the
Person to whom expenses are advanced provides an undertaking to repay such
advances if it is ultimately determined that such Person is not entitled to
indemnification pursuant to this _Section 7.8_ ). In the event of any such
Proceeding (x) neither Parent nor the Surviving Corporation shall settle,
compromise or consent to the entry of any judgment in any Proceeding in which
indemnification has been sought by such Indemnified Party hereunder, unless
such settlement, compromise or consent relates only to monetary damages for
which the Surviving Corporation is entirely responsible and includes an
unconditional release of such Indemnified Party from all liability arising out
of such Proceeding or such Indemnified Party otherwise consents (which consent
shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed) and (y) the
Surviving Corporation shall reasonably cooperate with the Indemnified Party in
the defense of any such matter. In the event any Proceeding is brought against
any Indemnified Party and in which indemnification could be sought by such
Indemnified Party under this _Section 7.8_ , (i) the Surviving Corporation
shall have the right to control the defense thereof after the Effective Time,
(ii) subject to the retention of additional counsel if necessary as a result
of any conflict of interest, the applicable Indemnified Parties shall be
entitled to retain a single firm to serve as their own counsel for any such
Proceeding, whether or not the Surviving Corporation shall elect to control
the defense of such Proceeding, (iii) the Surviving Corporation shall pay all
reasonable fees and expenses of any such counsel retained by one or more
Indemnified Parties promptly after statements therefor are received, if the
Surviving Corporation does not elect to control the defense of any such
Proceeding, and (iv) no Indemnified Party shall be liable to Parent or the
Surviving Corporation for any settlement effected without his or her prior
express written consent; _provided_ that for purposes of clauses (ii) and
(iii) the Indemnified Party on behalf of whom fees and expenses are paid
provides an undertaking to repay such fees and expenses if it is ultimately
determined that such Person is not entitled to indemnification pursuant to
this _Section 7.8_ ).

  



  

(b) Any Indemnified Party wishing to claim indemnification under this
_Section 7.8_ , upon learning of any such Proceeding, shall promptly notify
the Surviving Corporation thereof, but the failure to so notify shall not
relieve the Surviving Corporation of any liability it may have to such
Indemnified Party except to the extent such failure materially prejudices the
indemnifying Party.

  



  

(c) For a period of six years after the Effective Time, or if any
applicable statute of limitations is extended to a later date, for a period
ending on such later date, the provisions in the Surviving Corporation's
certificate of incorporation and bylaws with respect to indemnification,
advancement of expenses and exculpation of former or present directors and
officers shall be no less favorable to such directors and officers than such
provisions contained in the Company's Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws
in effect as of the date hereof, which provisions shall not be amended,
repealed or otherwise modified for a period of six years after the Effective
Time, or if any applicable statute of limitations is extended to a later date,
for a period ending on such later date, in any manner that would adversely
affect the rights thereunder of any such individuals.

  



  

 

 

 

59

   

 



 

 

 

  



  

(d) Parent shall maintain, or shall cause the Surviving Corporation to
maintain, at no expense to the beneficiaries, in effect for at least six years
from the Effective Time the current policies of the directors' and officers'
liability insurance and fiduciary liability insurance maintained by the
Company ( _provided_ that Parent or the Surviving Corporation may substitute
therefor policies of at least the same coverage containing terms and
conditions which are not less advantageous to any beneficiary thereof) with
respect to matters existing or occurring at or prior to the Effective Time. At
Parent's option, in lieu of maintaining such current policies, the Company
shall purchase from insurance carriers with comparable credit ratings, no
later than the Effective Time, a six-year prepaid "tail policy" providing at
least the same coverage and amounts containing terms and conditions that are
no less advantageous in the aggregate to the insured than the current policies
of directors' and officers' liability insurance and fiduciary liability
insurance maintained by the Company and its subsidiaries with respect to
claims arising from facts or events that occurred at or before the Effective
Time, including the transactions contemplated hereby; _provided_ , _however_ ,
that after the Effective Time, Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall not
be required to pay in the aggregate for such coverage under each such policy
more than 300% of the last annual premium paid by the Company prior to the
date hereof in respect of the coverage required to be obtained pursuant hereto
under each such policy, but in such case shall purchase as much coverage as
reasonably practicable for such amount. In the event the Company elects to
purchase such a "tail policy", the Surviving Corporation shall (and Parent
shall cause the Surviving Corporation to) maintain such "tail policy" in full
force and effect and continue to honor their respective obligations thereunder
for six years from the Effective Time. Parent agrees to cause the Surviving
Corporation to honor and perform under, all indemnification agreements that
entered into by the Company or any of its subsidiaries with any Indemnified
Party and that copies of which have been provided to Parent prior to the date
hereof.

  



  

(e) If Parent or the Surviving Corporation or any of their respective
successors or assigns (i) shall consolidate with or merge into any other
corporation or entity and shall not be the continuing or surviving corporation
or entity of such consolidation or merger or (ii) shall transfer all or
substantially all of its properties and assets to any individual, corporation
or other entity, then, and in each such case, proper provisions shall be made
so that the successors and assigns of Parent or the Surviving Corporation
shall assume all of the obligations set forth in this _Section 7.8_.

  



  

(f) The provisions of this _Section 7.8_ shall survive the Merger and,
following the Effective Time, are intended to be for the benefit of, and shall
be enforceable by, each of the Indemnified Parties and their heirs and
representatives.

(g) The rights of the Indemnified Parties under this _Section 7.8_ shall
be in addition to any rights such Indemnified Parties may have under the
Certificate of Incorporation or Bylaws of the Company or the comparable
governing instruments of any of its subsidiaries, or under any applicable
Contracts or Laws. Nothing in this Agreement is intended to, shall be
construed to or shall release, waive or impair any rights to directors' and
officers' insurance claims under any policy that is or has been in existence
with respect to the Company or its officers, directors and employees, it being
understood that the indemnification provided for in this _Section 7.8_ is not
prior to, or in substitution for, any such claims under any such policies.

  



  

SECTION 7.9 _Treatment of Company Indebtedness_. At the Closing, Parent
shall pay or cause to be paid, using funds provided from the Financing, all of
the then-outstanding indebtedness under the Credit Facilities and under the
Port Dania Mortgage. The Company shall, or shall cause its applicable
subsidiaries to, arrange for customary payoff letters and instruments of
discharge to be delivered at Closing (in form reasonably satisfactory to
Parent) providing for the payoff, discharge and termination on the Closing
Date of all then-outstanding indebtedness under the Credit Facilities and
under the Port Dania Mortgage, including, in each case, any related Liens with
respect to the assets of the Company or its subsidiaries, and shall deliver,
or cause its applicable subsidiaries to deliver, prepayment and termination
notices in accordance with the terms of such indebtedness ( _provided_ that
such prepayment and termination notices may be conditional on the occurrence
of the Closing).

SECTION 7.10 _Financing_.

  



  

(a) Parent and Merger Sub shall use reasonable best efforts to take, or
cause to be taken, all actions and to do, or cause to be done, all things
necessary, proper or advisable to arrange and consummate the Financing on the
terms and conditions described in or contemplated by the Financing
Commitments, including using reasonable best efforts to (i) maintain in full
force and effect the Financing Commitments until the earliest of the
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby, the termination of this
Agreement or the time at which any Alternative Financing is obtained, (ii)
satisfy on a timely basis, to the extent within their control, all conditions
to funding in the Debt Financing Commitments and such definitive agreements to
be entered into pursuant thereto (including by consummating the Equity
Financing at or prior to the Offer Acceptance Time), (iii) negotiate and enter
into definitive agreements with respect thereto on terms and conditions
described in the Debt Financing Commitments (including any "flex" provisions
contained therein) or otherwise consistent in all material respects with the
Debt Financing Commitments and on other terms that would not (A) reduce the
aggregate principal amount of the Debt Financing to an amount that would be
less than an amount that would be required to consummate the Offer and the
Merger and make the other payments required by Parent, Merger Sub and the
Surviving Corporation hereunder or otherwise contemplated in connection
herewith and repay or refinance the debt contemplated in this Agreement or the
Financing Commitments (unless the Equity Financing is increased by a
corresponding amount) or (B) impose new or additional conditions or otherwise
adversely amend or modify any of the conditions to the receipt of the
Financing, in each case, in a manner that would reasonably be expected to
prevent or materially delay the receipt of the Debt Financing prior to the
Closing Date and (iv) in the event that all conditions in the Debt Financing
Commitments have been satisfied, consummate the Debt Financing contemplated
under the Debt Financing Commitment required to consummate the Offer and the
Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby. Parent shall use its
reasonable best efforts to obtain the Equity Financing contemplated by the
Equity Financing Commitment upon satisfaction or waiver of the Offer
Conditions (other than conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied or
waived at the Offer Acceptance Time). To the extent reasonably requested by
the Company from time to time, Parent shall keep the Company informed on a
reasonably current basis of the status of its efforts to arrange the Financing
(or Alternative Financing) and Parent shall provide to the Company copies of
all documents reasonably requested by the Company related to the Financing (or
Alternative Financing), except that provisions related to fees (including any
fee letters), pricing, "market flex" (other than any structure flex) and other
customary economic or commercially sensitive terms may be redacted in a
customary manner; _provided_ , that in no event will Parent or Merger Sub be
under any obligation to disclose any information that (x) is subject to
attorney-client, attorney work product or other legal privilege or doctrine if
Parent or Merger Sub shall have used its commercially reasonable efforts to
disclose such information in a manner that would not waive such privilege or
doctrine or (y) would contravene any applicable Law. In the event any portion
of the Debt Financing becomes unavailable on the terms and conditions
contemplated in the Debt Financing Commitments for any reason (A) Parent shall
promptly notify the Company in writing and (B) Parent and Merger Sub shall
use, and shall cause their respective subsidiaries to use, their reasonable
best efforts to arrange to obtain alternative financing from alternative
sources (the " _Alternative Financing_ ") in an amount, when added with Parent
and Merger Sub's existing cash on hand and the Equity Financing Commitment,
sufficient to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement as
promptly as practicable following the occurrence of such event, which would
not (i) involve terms and conditions that are less beneficial in the aggregate
to Parent or Merger Sub and (ii) would not reasonably be expected to prevent,
impede or delay the consummation of the Closing. Without limiting the
generality of the foregoing, Parent shall promptly notify the Company in
writing of (A) the receipt by Parent or Merger Sub of any written notice or
other written communication from any lender or other debt financing source
with respect to any actual breach, default, repudiation, cancellation or
termination by any party to the Financing Commitment, (B) any material dispute
or disagreement between or among any parties to any Financing Commitments
(excluding, for the avoidance of doubt, ordinary course negotiations with
respect to the terms of the Debt Financing) or (C) Parent becoming aware of
any fact, circumstance, event or other reason that it reasonably expects will
result in (x) Parent not being able to obtain all or any portion of the
Financing contemplated to be funded at the Closing on the material terms, in
the manner or from the sources contemplated by the Financing Commitments or
(y) the prevention, impediment or delay of the consummation of the Closing. As
soon as reasonably practicable, Parent shall provide any information
reasonably requested in writing by the Company relating to any circumstance
referred to in clause (A), (B) or (C) of the immediately preceding sentence
that is in Parent's possession; _provided_ , that in no event will Parent or
Merger Sub be under any obligation to disclose any information that (x) is
subject to attorney-client, attorney work product or other legal privilege or
doctrine if Parent or Merger Sub shall have used its commercially reasonable
efforts to disclose such information in a manner that would not waive such
privilege or doctrine or (y) would contravene any applicable Law. Parent,
Merger Sub and Guarantor shall not (without the prior written consent of the
Company) consent or agree to any amendment, replacement, supplement or
modification to, or any waiver of any provision under, the Financing
Commitments or the definitive agreements relating to the Financing if such
amendment, replacement, supplement, modification or waiver (1) decreases the
aggregate amount of the Financing to an amount that would be less than an
amount that would be required to consummate the Offer and the Merger and make
the other payments required by Parent, Merger Sub and the Surviving
Corporation hereunder, (2) imposes new or additional conditions or otherwise
adversely expands, amends or modifies any of the conditions to the receipt of
the Financing, (3) could reasonably be expected to prevent, impede or delay
the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, or (4)
materially and adversely impacts the ability of Parent or Merger Sub to
enforce its rights against the other parties to the Financing Commitments.
Parent shall furnish to the Company a copy of any amendment, modification,
waiver or consent of or relating to the Financing Commitments promptly upon
execution thereof. Parent and Merger Sub shall use their reasonable best
efforts to maintain the effectiveness of the Financing Commitments until the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement are consummated; _provided_ ,
_however_ , for the avoidance of doubt, Parent and Merger Sub may amend,
replace, supplement and/or modify the Debt Financing Commitments to add
lenders, lead arrangers, bookrunners, syndication agents or similar entities
as parties thereto who had not executed the Debt Financing Commitments as of
the date hereof. Parent shall provide the Company, upon reasonable request,
with such information and documentation as shall be reasonably necessary to
allow the Company to monitor the progress of such financing activities. Upon
any amendment, supplement or modification of the Financing Commitments made in
compliance with this _Section 7.10(a)_ , Parent shall provide a copy thereof
to the Company and the term " _Financing Commitments_ " shall mean the
Financing Commitments as so amended, replaced, supplemented or modified,
including any Alternative Financing (other than for purposes of _Section 5.8_
). Notwithstanding the foregoing, compliance by Parent with this _Section
7.10_ shall not relieve Parent or Merger Sub of its obligation to consummate
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement whether or not the Financing
is available and each of Parent and Merger Sub acknowledges that this
Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby are not contingent on
Parent or Merger Sub's ability to obtain the Financing (or any Alternative
Financing) or any specific term with respect to such financing.

the occurrence of the Effective Time and (C) no liability shall be imposed on
the Company, any of its subsidiaries, or any of their respective officers or
employees involved), (iii) providing information regarding the Company and its

to the extent reasonably requested by Parent cooperating in satisfying the
conditions set forth in the Debt Commitment Letter to the extent the
satisfaction of such condition requires the cooperation of, or is within the
control of, the Company or any subsidiary. Notwithstanding the foregoing, (x)
nothing in this _Section 7.10_ shall require such cooperation to the extent it
would unreasonably interfere with the business or operations of the Company
and its subsidiaries, and (y) none of the Company or any of its subsidiaries
shall be required to pay any commitment or other fee or incur any other
liability or obligation in connection with the Debt Financing contemplated by
the Debt Financing Commitments or be required to take any action for which it

"business combination," "control share acquisition" or other form of anti-
takeover statute or regulation is or may become applicable to the Merger or
the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement, each of the Company and

Any amount payable pursuant to _Section 9.2(b)_ shall be paid by the
applicable Party by wire transfer of same day funds prior to or on the date
such payment is required to be made under _Section 9.2(b)_.

claim, controversy, dispute or cause of action of any kind or nature (whether
based upon contract, tort or otherwise) involving a Lender Related Party that
is in any way related to this Agreement, the Merger or any of the other
transactions contemplated hereby, including any dispute arising out of or
relating in any way to the Debt Financing (including with respect to the Debt
Financing Commitments or the definitive agreements with respect to the Debt
Financing to be entered into in connection with the Closing) shall be governed
by, and construed in accordance with, the Laws of the State of New York.

  



  

SECTION 10.10 _Headings_. The descriptive headings contained in this
Agreement are included for convenience of reference only and shall not affect
in any way the meaning or interpretation of this Agreement.

  



  

SECTION 10.11 _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed and
delivered (including by facsimile transmission, ".pdf," or other electronic
transmission) in one or more counterparts, and by the different Parties in
separate counterparts, each of which when executed shall be deemed to be an
original but all of which taken together shall constitute one and the same
agreement.

  



  

SECTION 10.12 _Specific Performance_.

  



  

(a) The Parties agree that irreparable damage for which monetary damages,
even if available, may not be an adequate remedy, would occur in the event
that the Parties do not perform the provisions of this Agreement (including
failing to take such actions as are required of it hereunder in order to
consummate this Agreement) in accordance with its specified terms or otherwise
breach such provisions, and accordingly, but subject to _Section 10.12(b)_ ,
the Parties acknowledge and agree that the Parties shall be entitled to an
injunction, specific performance and other equitable relief to prevent
breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and
provisions hereof, without any requirement for the posting of security, this
being in addition to any other remedy to which they are entitled at law or in
equity. Subject to _Section 10.12(b)_ , the Parties hereby further acknowledge
and agree that prior to the Closing, the Company shall be entitled to seek
specific performance to enforce specifically the terms and provisions of, and
to prevent or cure breaches of this Agreement, by Parent or Merger Sub.

  



  

(b) Notwithstanding anything herein or in any Transaction Document to the
contrary, it is hereby acknowledged and agreed that the Company shall be
entitled to seek specific performance to cause Parent and Merger Sub to cause
the Equity Financing to be funded and to cause the Offer Acceptance Time to
occur and to consummate the Closing if, and only if, (A) at the Expiration
Date, all of the Offer Conditions shall be satisfied or waived in writing
(other than conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied or waived at
the Offer Acceptance Time), (B) with respect to the consummation of the
Merger, all of the conditions set forth in _Section 8.1_ are satisfied or
waived in writing (other than conditions that by their nature are to be
satisfied or waived at the Effective Time), (C) the financing contemplated by
the Debt Financing Commitments (or, if applicable, the Alternative Financing)
has been funded in full in accordance with its terms or will be funded in full
in accordance with its terms at the Offer Acceptance Time or the Closing if
the Equity Financing is funded and (D) the Company has confirmed that, if
specific performance is granted and the Equity Financing and Debt Financing
are funded, then the Closing will occur.

  



  

 

 

 

79

   

 



 

 

 

  



  

(c) Each of the Parties agrees that it will not oppose the granting of an
injunction, specific performance and other equitable relief as provided herein
on the basis that (x) either Party has an adequate remedy at law or (y) an
award of specific performance is not an appropriate remedy for any reason at
law or equity. Any Party seeking an injunction or injunctions to prevent
breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and
provisions of this Agreement shall not be required to provide any bond or
other security in connection with any such order or injunction.
Notwithstanding anything else to the contrary in this Agreement, for the
avoidance of doubt, while the Company may concurrently seek (i) specific
performance or other equitable relief, subject in all respects to this
_Section 10.12_ and (ii) payment of the Parent Termination Fee if, as and when
required pursuant to this Agreement, under no circumstances shall the Company
be permitted or entitled to receive both a grant of specific performance to
cause the Equity Financing to be funded (whether under this Agreement or the
Equity Financing Commitment), on the one hand, and payment of the Parent
Termination Fee, on the other hand.

  



  

SECTION 10.13 _Jurisdiction_.

  



  

(a) Each of the Parties irrevocably (i) consents to submit itself to the
sole and exclusive jurisdiction of the Delaware Court of Chancery and any
state appellate court therefrom within the State of Delaware (unless the
Delaware Court of Chancery shall decline to accept jurisdiction over a
particular matter, in which case, in any Delaware state or federal court
within the State of Delaware), in connection with any matter based upon or
arising out of this Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement or the actions of Parent, Merger Sub or the Company in the
negotiation, administration, performance and enforcement hereof and thereof,
(ii) agrees that it will not attempt to deny or defeat such personal
jurisdiction by motion or other request for leave from any such court, (iii)
agrees that it will not bring any action relating to this Agreement or any of
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement in any court other than the
courts of the State of Delaware, as described above, and (iv) consents to
service being made through the notice procedures set forth in _Section 10.4_.
Each of the Company, Parent and Merger Sub hereby agrees that service of any
process, summons, notice or document by U.S. registered mail to the respective
addresses set forth in _Section 10.4_ shall be effective service of process
for any suit or proceeding in connection with this Agreement or the
transactions contemplated hereby. Each Party hereto hereby irrevocably waives,
and agrees not to assert, by way of motion, as a defense, counterclaim or
otherwise, in any action or proceeding with respect to this Agreement, any
claim that it is not personally subject to the jurisdiction of the above-named
courts for any reason other than the failure to serve process in accordance
with this _Section 10.13_ , that it or its property is exempt or immune from
jurisdiction of any such court or from any legal process commenced in such
courts (whether through service of notice, attachment prior to judgment,
attachment in aid of execution of judgment, execution of judgment or
otherwise), and to the fullest extent permitted by applicable Law, that the
suit, action or proceeding in any such court is brought in an inconvenient
forum, that the venue of such suit, action or proceeding is improper, or that
this Agreement, or the subject matter hereof or thereof, may not be enforced
in or by such courts and further irrevocably waives, to the fullest extent
permitted by applicable Law, the benefit of any defense that would hinder,
fetter or delay the levy, execution or collection of any amount to which the
Party is entitled pursuant to the final judgment of any court having
jurisdiction. Each Party expressly acknowledges that the foregoing waiver is
intended to be irrevocable under the Laws of the State of Delaware and of the
United States of America; _provided_ that each such Party's consent to
jurisdiction and service contained in this _Section 10.13_ is solely for the
purpose referred to in this _Section 10.13_ and shall not be deemed to be a
general submission to said courts or in the State of Delaware other than for
such purpose.

  



  

 

 

 

80

   

 



 

 

 

  



  

(b) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, each Party
hereby irrevocably and unconditionally agrees that it will not bring or
support any litigation against any Lender Related Party under the Debt
Financing in any way relating to this Agreement or any of the transactions
contemplated hereby, including any dispute arising out of or relating in any
way to the Debt Financing or the performance thereof, in any forum other than
a court of competent jurisdiction sitting in the Borough of Manhattan of the
City of New York, whether a state or federal court, and that the provisions of
_Section 10.14_ relating to the waiver of jury trial shall apply to any such
action, suit or proceeding. The parties hereto further agree to waive and
hereby irrevocably waive, to the fullest extent permitted by law, any
objection which it may now have or hereafter have to the laying of venue of,
and the defense of an inconvenient forum to the maintenance of, any such
action in any such court and makes the agreements, waivers and consents set
forth in _Section 10.13(a)_ _mutatis mutandis_ but with respect to the courts
specified in this _Section 10.13(b)_.

  



  

SECTION 10.14 _WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL_. EACH OF PARENT, MERGER SUB AND THE
COMPANY HEREBY IRREVOCABLY WAIVES ANY AND ALL RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY
ACTION, PROCEEDING OR COUNTERCLAIM (WHETHER BASED ON CONTRACT, TORT OR
OTHERWISE) ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT OR THE TRANSACTIONS
CONTEMPLATED HEREBY (INCLUDING ANY SUCH ACTION INVOLVING ANY LENDER RELATED
PARTY UNDER THE DEBT FINANCING) OR THE ACTIONS OF PARENT OR THE COMPANY IN THE
NEGOTIATION, ADMINISTRATION, PERFORMANCE AND ENFORCEMENT HEREOF OR THEREOF.

  



  

SECTION 10.15 _Interpretation_. When reference is made in this Agreement
to an Article, Exhibit, Schedule or Section, such reference shall be to an
Article, Exhibit, Schedule or Section of this Agreement unless otherwise
indicated. Whenever the words "include", "includes" or "including" are used in
this Agreement, they shall be deemed to be followed by the words "without
limitation." The words "hereof," "herein," "hereby" and "hereunder" and words
of similar import when used in this Agreement shall refer to this Agreement as
a whole and not to any particular provision of this Agreement. All terms
defined in this Agreement shall have the defined meanings when used in any
certificate or other document made or delivered pursuant thereto unless
otherwise defined therein. Words of any gender include each other gender and
neuter genders and words using the singular or plural number also include the
plural or singular number, respectively. Any Contract or Law defined or
referred to herein means such Contract or Law as from time to time amended,
modified or supplemented, including (in the case of Contracts) by written
waiver or consent and (in the case of Laws) by succession or comparable
successor statutes and references to all attachments thereto and instruments
incorporated therein. The word "or" shall not be exclusive. With respect to
the determination of any period of time, "from" means "from and including".
The word "will" shall be construed to have the same meaning as the word
"shall". Whenever this Agreement refers to a number of days, such number shall
refer to calendar days unless Business Days are specified. The word "to the
extent" shall mean the degree to which a subject or other thing extends, and
such phrase shall not mean simply "if". References to "dollars" or "$" are to
United States of America dollars. Any deadline or time period set forth in
this Agreement that by its terms ends on a day that is not a Business Day
shall be automatically extended to the next succeeding Business Day. Each of
the Parties has participated in the drafting and negotiating of this
Agreement. If an ambiguity or question of intent or interpretation arises,
this Agreement shall be construed as if it is drafted by all the Parties and
without regard to any presumption or rule requiring construction or
interpretation against the Party drafting or causing any instrument to be
drafted. The words "made available to Parent", "furnished to Parent" and words
of similar import refer to documents that have either been (A) posted to the
"Project Safari" virtual data room maintained by Intralinks by or on behalf of
the Company or (B) delivered in person or electronically to Parent, Merger Sub
or their respective Representatives, in each case, no later than 11:59 p.m.
Eastern Time on the date prior to the date of this Agreement.

SECTION 10.16 _Non-Recourse_.

  



  

(a) Without limiting any of the express terms or conditions of this
Agreement, each party agrees, on behalf of itself and its Affiliates and
Representatives, that other than pursuant to (A) the Confidentiality
Agreement, (B) pursuant to the Equity Financing Commitment and (C) pursuant to
the Limited Guarantee, all proceedings, claims, obligations, liabilities or
causes of action (whether in Contract or in tort, in Law or in equity or
otherwise, or granted by statute or otherwise, whether by or through attempted
piercing of the corporate, limited partnership or limited liability company
veil or any other theory or doctrine, including alter ego or otherwise) that
may be based upon, in respect of, arise under, out or by reason of, be
connected with, or relate to (i) this Agreement or the transactions
contemplated hereby, (ii) the negotiation, execution or performance of this
Agreement (including any representation or warranty made in, in connection
with, or as an inducement to, this Agreement), (iii) any breach or violation
of this Agreement and (iv) any failure of the transactions contemplated hereby
to be consummated, in each case, may be made only against (and are those
solely of) the Persons that are expressly identified herein as a party to this
Agreement (or a party to any such other agreement referenced herein or
contemplated hereunder) and in accordance with, and subject to the terms and
conditions of, this Agreement (or the terms of any such other agreement
referenced herein or contemplated hereunder).

  



  

(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein and without
limiting the obligations of the relevant Lender Related Parties to Parent
under the Debt Financing Commitments, each party hereto, on behalf of itself
and its respective Affiliates, irrevocably and unconditionally acknowledges
and agrees that this Agreement may not be enforced against any Lender Related
Party and none of the Lender Related Parties shall have any liability or
obligation to the Company, any of its subsidiaries, the holders of the
Company's stock or any of its or their respective Affiliates relating to this
Agreement or the transactions contemplated herein, including any dispute
related to, or arising from, the Debt Financing, the Debt Financing
Commitments or the performance thereof.

or contract, and any contract or act that shall be approved or be ratified by
the vote of the holders of a majority of the stock of the Corporation which is
represented in person or by proxy at such meeting and entitled to vote thereat
( _provided_ that a lawful quorum of stockholders be there represented in
person or by proxy) shall be as valid and binding upon the Corporation and

otherwise be open to legal attack because of directors' interests, or for any
other reason.

  



  

D. In addition to the powers and authorities hereinbefore or by statute
expressly conferred upon them, the directors are hereby empowered to exercise
all such powers and do all such acts and things as may be exercised or done by

Delaware, of this Second Restated Certificate of Incorporation, and to any
bylaws from time to time made by the stockholders; _provided_ , _however_ ,

The Board of Directors (or any executive committee or other committee constituted with similar authority to that of an executive committee) is authorized to take such other ministerial actions or make such interpretations as it may deem necessary or advisable in order to implement this Dual Stock Certificate System in a manner consistent with the policies set forth in this Article EIGHTH.

  



  

E. _Excess Shares_.

  



  

1. If on any date, including, without limitation, any record date (each, an " **Excess Share Date** "), the number of shares of Capital Stock beneficially owned by Non-Citizens should exceed the Permitted Amount, irrespective of the date on which such event becomes known to the Corporation (such shares in excess of the Permitted Amount, the " **Excess Shares** "), then the shares of such Capital Stock of the Corporation that constitute Excess Shares for purposes of this Article EIGHTH shall be (a) those shares that have been acquired by or become beneficially owned by Non-Citizens, starting with the most recent acquisition of beneficial ownership of such shares by a Non-Citizen and including, in reverse chronological order of acquisition, all other acquisitions of beneficial ownership of such shares by Non-Citizens from and after the acquisition of beneficial ownership of such shares by a Non-Citizen that first caused such Permitted Amount to be exceeded, or (b) those shares beneficially owned by Non-Citizens that exceed the Permitted Amount as the result of any repurchase or redemption by the Corporation of shares of its Capital Stock, starting with the most recent acquisition of beneficial ownership of such shares by a Non-Citizen and going in reverse chronological order of acquisition; _provided_ _,_ _however_ , that: (i) the Corporation shall have the sole power to determine, in the exercise of its reasonable judgment, those shares that constitute Excess Shares in accordance with the provisions of this Article EIGHTH; (ii) the Corporation may, in its reasonable discretion, rely on any reasonable documentation provided by Non-Citizens with respect to the date and time of their acquisition of beneficial ownership of Excess Shares; (iii) if the acquisition of beneficial ownership of more than one Excess Share occurs on the same date and the time of acquisition is not definitively established, then the order in which such acquisitions shall be deemed to have occurred on such date shall be determined by lot or by such other method as the Corporation may, in its reasonable discretion, deem appropriate; (iv) Excess Shares that result from a determination that a beneficial owner has ceased to be a Citizen shall be deemed to have been acquired, for purposes of this Article EIGHTH, as of the date that such beneficial owner ceased to be a Citizen; and (v) the Corporation may adjust upward to the nearest whole share the number of shares of such class or series deemed to be Excess Shares. Any determination made by the Corporation pursuant to this subparagraph E as to which shares of Capital Stock constitute Excess Shares shall be conclusive and shall be deemed effective as of the applicable Excess Share Date.

  



  

 

 

 



   

 



 

 

 

  



  

F. _Redemption_ _o_ _f Excess Shares_.

  



  

1. In the event that (a) subparagraph C of this Article EIGHTH would not be effective for any reason to prevent the transfer of beneficial ownership of any Excess Shares to a Non-Citizen, (b) a change in the status of a Person from a Citizen to a Non-Citizen causes a share of Capital Stock of which such Person is the beneficial owner to constitute an Excess Share, (c) any repurchase or redemption by the Corporation of shares of its Capital Stock causes any share of Capital Stock of the Corporation beneficially owned by Non-Citizens to exceed the Permitted Amount, or (d) the original issuance by the Corporation of a share of Capital Stock of the Corporation to a Non-Citizen results in such share constituting an Excess Share, then, the Corporation, by action of the Board of Directors (or any executive committee or other committee constituted with similar authority to that of an executive committee), in its sole discretion, shall have the power to redeem, unless such redemption is not permitted under the DGCL or other provisions of applicable law, such Excess Share; _provided_ _,_ _however_ , that the Corporation shall not have any obligation under this subparagraph F to redeem any one or more Excess Shares.

  



  

2. Until such time as any Excess Shares subject to redemption by the Corporation pursuant to this subparagraph F are so redeemed by the Corporation at its option and beginning on the first Excess Share Date for the classes or series of the Capital Stock of which such Excess Shares are a part,

 \t\t\t \t\t 
---|---|--- 
    



  

Full voting rights shall be restored to any shares of Capital Stock of the
Corporation that were previously deemed to be Excess Shares, and any dividends
or distributions with respect thereto that have been previously paid into an
escrow account shall be due and paid solely to the holders of record of such
shares, promptly after such time as, and to the extent that, such shares have
ceased to be Excess Shares (including as a result of the sale of such shares
to a Citizen prior to the issuance of a Redemption Notice pursuant to section
3 of this subparagraph F of this Article EIGHTH), _provided_ _,_ _however_ ,
that such shares have not been already redeemed by the Corporation at its
option pursuant to this subparagraph F.

  



  

3. The terms and conditions of redemptions by the Corporation of Excess Shares of Capital Stock under this subparagraph F shall be as follows:

 \t\t\t \t\t

(f)

 \t\t\t \t\t\t|  \t\t\t

in the case of the Redemption Price paid in whole by cash, if a Redemption
Notice has been duly sent to the Record Holders of the Excess Shares to be

 \t\t\t \t\t 
---|---|--- 
    



  

4. Nothing in this subparagraph F of Article EIGHTH shall prevent the recipient of a Redemption Notice from transferring its shares before the Redemption Date if such transfer is otherwise permitted under this Second Restated Certificate of Incorporation and applicable law and the recipient provides notice of such proposed transfer to the Board of Directors along with the documentation and information required under subparagraph H of this Article EIGHTH establishing that such proposed transferee is a Citizen to the satisfaction of the Board of Directors in its sole discretion before the Redemption Date.

G. _Citizenship Determinations_. The Corporation shall have the power to
determine, in the exercise of its reasonable judgment and with the advice of
counsel, the citizenship of the beneficial owners and the transferees or
proposed transferees of any class or series of the Capital Stock for the
purposes of this Article EIGHTH. In determining the citizenship of the
beneficial owners or their transferees or proposed transferees or, in the case
of original issuance, any recipient (and, if such transferees, proposed
transferees or recipients are acting as fiduciaries or nominees for any
beneficial owners, with respect to such beneficial owners) of any class or
series of the Capital Stock, the Corporation may rely on the stock transfer
records of the Corporation and the citizenship certifications required under
Section 2 of subparagraph C of this Article EIGHTH and the written statements
and affidavits required under subparagraph H of this Article EIGHTH given by
the beneficial owners or their transferees or proposed transferees, or, in the
case of original issuance, any recipients (or any beneficial owners for whom
such transferees or proposed transferees or recipients are acting as
fiduciaries or nominees) (in each case whether such certifications, written
statements or affidavits have been given on their own behalf or on behalf of
others) to prove the citizenship of such beneficial owners, transferees,
proposed transferees or recipients (or any beneficial owners for whom such
transferees, proposed transferees or recipients are acting as fiduciaries or
nominees). The determination of the citizenship of such beneficial owners,
transferees, proposed transferees and recipients (and any beneficial owners
for whom such transferees, proposed transferees or recipients are acting as
fiduciaries or nominees) may also be subject to proof in such other manner as
the Corporation may deem reasonable pursuant to Section 2 of subparagraph H of
this Article EIGHTH. The determination of the Corporation at any time as to
the citizenship of such beneficial owners, transferees, proposed transferees
and recipients (and any beneficial owners for whom such transferees, proposed
transferees or recipients are acting as fiduciaries or nominees) in accordance
with the provisions of Article EIGHTH shall be conclusive.

I. _Severability_. Each provision of this Article EIGHTH is intended to
be severable from every other provision. If any one or more of the provisions

omissions not in good faith or which involve intentional misconduct or a
knowing violation of law, (3) under Section 174 of the DGCL, or (4) for any
transaction from which the director derived an improper personal benefit. If
the DGCL is amended to authorize corporate action further eliminating or
limiting the personal liability of directors, then the liability of a director
of the Corporation shall be eliminated or limited to the fullest extent
permitted by the DGCL, as so amended. Any repeal or modification of this

B. The Corporation, to the full extent permitted by Section 145 of the
DGCL, as amended from time to time, shall indemnify all persons whom it may
indemnify pursuant thereto. Expenses (including attorneys' fees) incurred by

investigative action, suit or proceeding for which such officer or director
may be entitled to indemnification hereunder shall be paid by the Corporation
in advance of the final disposition of such action, suit or proceeding upon
receipt of an undertaking by or on behalf of such director or officer to repay
such amount if it shall ultimately be determined that he is not entitled to be
indemnified by the Corporation as authorized hereby.

  



  

C. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, the Corporation shall
have no obligation to indemnify any person with respect to any expenses,
damages, losses, liabilities, judgments, payments, fines, penalties, awards or
amounts paid in settlement (collectively, " **Losses** ") or to advance any
expenses of such person, in each case, that arise from facts and circumstances
occurring, or actions taken, prior to the date of adoption of this Second
Restated Certificate of Incorporation; _provided_ , _however_ , that any
person covered by any run-off policy or policies of directors' and officers',
employee practices and fiduciary liability insurance procured by the
Corporation shall be entitled to indemnification of Losses and advancement of
expenses, in each case, that arise from facts and circumstances occurring, or
actions taken, prior to the date of adoption of this Second Restated
Certificate of Incorporation, but only to the extent indemnification for such
Losses or advancement of such expenses is covered by such policy or policies,
from the date of adoption of this Second Restated Certificate of Incorporation
until the sixth anniversary of such date.

  



  

 

 

 



   

 



 

 

 

  



  

 **TENTH** **.**

  



  

Whenever a compromise or arrangement is proposed between this Corporation and
its creditors or any class of them and/or between this Corporation and its
stockholders or any class of them, any court of equitable jurisdiction within
the State of Delaware may, on the application in a summary way of this
Corporation or of any creditor or stockholder thereof or on the application of
any receiver or receivers appointed for this Corporation under Section 291 of
the DGCL or on the application of trustees in dissolution or of any receiver
or receivers appointed for this Corporation under Section 279 of the DGCL
order a meeting of the creditors or class of creditors, and/or of the
stockholders or class of stockholders of this Corporation, as the case may be,
to be summoned in such manner as the said court directs. If a majority in
number representing three fourths in value of the creditors or class of
creditors, and/or of the stockholders or class of stockholders of this
Corporation, as the case may be, agree to any compromise or arrangement and to
any reorganization of this Corporation as a consequence of such compromise or
arrangement, the said compromise or arrangement and the said reorganization
shall, if sanctioned by the court to which the said application has been made,
be binding on all the creditors or class of creditors, and/or on all the
stockholders or class of stockholders, of this Corporation, as the case may
be, and also on this Corporation.

  



  

 **ELEVENTH** **.**

  



  

A. Each stockholder (who is not also an employee of the Corporation or any
of its subsidiaries), each member of the Board of Directors or any committee
thereof (other than an employee of the Corporation or any of its
subsidiaries), each member of any board of directors, board of managers or
similar governing body of any subsidiary of the Corporation (other than an
employee of the Corporation or any of its subsidiaries), and any one or more
of the respective affiliates, managers, directors principals, officers,
employees and other representatives of each such stockholder, member of the
Board of Directors (or committee thereof) or member of any board of directors,
board of managers or similar governing body of any subsidiary of the
Corporation who is not (in any such case) also an employee of the Corporation
or any of its subsidiaries (the foregoing persons being referred to,
collectively, as " **Identified Persons** " and, each individually, as an "
**Identified Person** ") may now engage, may continue to engage, or may, in
the future, decide to engage, in the same or similar activities or lines of
business as those in which the Corporation or any of its affiliates, directly
or indirectly, now engage or may engage or other business activities that
overlap with, are complementary to, or compete with those in which the
Corporation or any of its affiliates, directly or indirectly, now engage or
may engage (any such activity or line of business, an " **Opportunity** "). No
Identified Person shall have any duty to refrain, directly or indirectly, from
(1) engaging in any Opportunity or (2) otherwise competing with the
Corporation or any of its affiliates. No Identified Person shall have any duty
or obligation to refer or offer to the Corporation or any of its affiliates
any Opportunity, and the Corporation hereby renounces any interest or
expectancy of the Corporation in, or in being offered, an opportunity to
participate in any Opportunity which may be a corporate (or analogous) or
business opportunity for the Corporation or any of its affiliates.

  



  

B. In the event that any Identified Person acquires knowledge of a
potential transaction or other corporate (or analogous) or business
opportunity which may be an Opportunity for the Corporation or any of its
affiliates, such Identified Person shall have no duty to communicate or offer
such Opportunity to the Corporation or any of its affiliates and shall not be
liable to the Corporation or the stockholders for breach of any purported
fiduciary duty by reason of the fact that such Identified Person pursues or
acquires such Opportunity for itself, or offers or directs such Opportunity to
another person (including any affiliate of such Identified Person).
Notwithstanding subparagraphs A and B of this Article ELEVENTH, the
Corporation does not renounce any intent or expectancy it may have in any
Opportunity that is offered to an officer or director of the Corporation
(whether or not such individual is also an officer or director of a
stockholder) if such Opportunity is expressly offered to such person in his or
her capacity as an officer or director of the Corporation or knowledge of such
Opportunity is acquired by such person solely as a result of such person's
position as an officer or director of the Corporation.

  



  

 

 

 



   

 



 

 

 

  



  

C. The Identified Persons may now own, may continue to own, and from time
to time may acquire and own, investments in one or more other entities (such
entities, collectively, " **Related** **Companies** ") that are direct
competitors of, or that otherwise may have interests that do or could conflict
with those of, the Corporation, any of the stockholders or any of their
respective affiliates, and (1) the enjoyment, exercise and enforcement of the
rights, interests, privileges, powers and benefits granted or available to the
Identified Persons under this Second Restated Certificate of Incorporation
and/or any other agreement with the Corporation, shall not be in any manner
reduced, diminished, affected or impaired, and the obligations of the
Identified Persons under this Second Restated Certificate of Incorporation
shall not be in any manner augmented or increased, by reason of any act,
circumstance, occurrence or event arising from or in any respect relating to
(a) the ownership by an Identified Person of any interest in any Related
Company, (b) the affiliation of any Related Company with an Identified Person
or (c) any action taken or omitted by an Identified Person in respect of any
Related Company, (2) no Identified Person shall, by reason of such ownership,
affiliation or action, become subject to any fiduciary duty to the
Corporation, any of the stockholders or any of their respective affiliates,
(3) none of the duties imposed on an Identified Person, whether by contract or
law, do or shall limit or impair the right of any Identified Person lawfully
to compete with the Corporation, any of the stockholders or any of their
respective affiliates and (4) the Identified Persons are not and shall not be
obligated to disclose to the Corporation, any of the stockholders or any of
their respective affiliates any information related to their respective
businesses or opportunities, including acquisition opportunities, or to
refrain from or in any respect to be restricted in competing against the
Corporation, any of the stockholders or any of their respective affiliates in
any such business or as to any such opportunities.

owned by Parent and its Affiliates, represent one more Share than 66 2/3% of
the total number of Shares outstanding at the time of the expiration of the
Offer (the " _Minimum Condition_ "); _provided_ , _however_ , that for
purposes of determining whether the Minimum Condition has been satisfied, the
Parties shall exclude Shares tendered in the Offer pursuant to guaranteed

Time as if made of the Offer Acceptance Time (except to the extent any such
representation or warranty speaks as of an earlier date, in which case such
representation and warranty shall be true and correct as of such earlier
date), except where the failures of any such representations and warranties to
be so true and correct, individually or in the aggregate, would not be
reasonably expected to have a Material Adverse Effect;

  



  

 

 

 



   

 



 

 

 

  



  

(c) the Company shall have performed in all material respects the
obligations, and complied in all material respects with the agreements and
covenants, required to be performed by, or complied with by, it under this

terms (the " _Termination Condition_ ").

pursuant to the terms of the Agreement. The foregoing conditions are for the
sole benefit of Parent and Merger Sub, may be asserted by Parent or Merger Sub

Condition) may be waived by Parent and Merger Sub, in whole or in part, at any
time and from time to time, in the sole and absolute discretion of Parent and
Merger Sub. The failure by Parent or Merger Sub at any time to exercise any of
