2.1. _Merger._

 

 

Subject  to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, at the Effective
Time: (a)  GLB  shall merge with and into FNFG, with FNFG as the resulting
or surviving  corporation (the "Surviving Corporation"); and (b) the separate
existence of GLB  shall cease and all of the rights, privileges, powers,
franchises, properties,  assets, liabilities and obligations of GLB shall be
vested in and assumed  by  FNFG. As part of the Merger, each share of GLB
Common Stock (other  than Dissenting Shares and Treasury Stock) will be
converted into the right  to  receive the Merger Consideration pursuant to
the terms of Article III  hereof. Immediately after the Merger, GBSB shall
merge with and into  First Niagara Bank, with First Niagara Bank as the
resulting  institution.

 

 

2.2. _Effective  Time._

 

 

The  Closing shall occur no later than the close of business on the fifth
business  day following the latest to occur of (i) the receipt of all 
Regulatory Approvals, (ii) GLB shareholder approval of the Merger, or (iii) 
the passing of any applicable waiting periods; or at such other date or time 
upon which FNFG and GLB mutually agree (the "Closing"). The Merger shall be 
effected by the filing of a certificate of merger with the Delaware Office

upon which the certificate of merger is filed with the Delaware Office  of

The  Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws of FNFG as in effect
immediately  prior  to the Effective Time shall be the Certificate of
Incorporation and Bylaws  of  the Surviving Corporation, until thereafter
amended as provided therein and  by  applicable law.

 

 

2.4. _Directors  and Officers of Surviving Corporation._

 

 

The  directors of FNFG immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be the
initial  directors of the Surviving Corporation, each to hold office in
accordance  with  the Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws of the

each case  until  their respective successors are duly elected or appointed
and  qualified.

 


 

 

 

 

 

 

 

8  

 

 

 

 

 


 

2.5. _Advisory  Board._

 

 

Effective  immediately after the Effective Time, Gerard T. Mazurkiewicz and

At  and  after the Effective Time, the Merger shall have the effects as set
forth  in the  DGCL.

 

 

2.7. _Tax  Consequences._

 

 

It  is  intended that the Merger shall constitute a reorganization within
the meaning  of  Section 368(a) of the Code, and that this Agreement shall
constitute a "plan of  reorganization" as that term is used in Sections 354
and 361 of the  Code. From and after the date of this Agreement and until
the  Closing, each party hereto shall use its reasonable best efforts to
cause  the  Merger to qualify, and will not knowingly take any action, cause
any action  to  be taken, fail to take any action or cause any action to
fail to be taken  which  action or failure to act could prevent the Merger
from qualifying as a  reorganization under Section 368(a) of the Code.
Following the  Closing, neither FNFG, GLB nor any of their affiliates shall
knowingly take  any  action, cause any action to be taken, fail to take any
action or cause any  action to fail to be taken, which action or failure to
act could cause the  Merger to fail to qualify as a reorganization under
Section 368(a) of the  Code. FNFG and GLB each hereby agrees to deliver
certificates  substantially in compliance with IRS published advance ruling
guidelines,  with  customary exceptions and modifications thereto, to enable
counsel to deliver  the  legal opinion contemplated by Section 9.1.6, which
certificates shall be  effective as of the date of such opinion.

 

 

2.8. _Possible  Alternative Structures._

 

 

Notwithstanding  anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, prior
to the Effective  Time FNFG shall be entitled to revise the structure of the
Merger or the  Bank  Merger, including without limitation, by merging GLB
into a wholly owned  subsidiary of FNFG, provided that (i) any such
subsidiary shall become a  party to, and shall agree to be bound by, the
terms of this Agreement  (ii) there are no adverse Federal or state income
tax consequences to GLB  shareholders as a result of the modification; (iii)
the consideration to  be paid  to the holders of GLB Common Stock under this
Agreement is not thereby changed  in kind, value or reduced in amount; and
(iv) such modification will not  delay  materially or jeopardize the receipt
of Regulatory Approvals or other consents  and approvals relating to the
consummation of the Merger and the Bank Merger  or  otherwise cause any
condition to Closing set forth in Article IX not to be  capable of being
fulfilled. The parties hereto agree to appropriately  amend this Agreement
and any related documents in order to reflect any such  revised structure.

 

 

2.9. _Bank  Merger_

 

 

FNFG  and  GLB shall use their reasonable best efforts to cause the merger
of GBSB with  and  into First Niagara Bank, with First Niagara Bank as the
surviving institution,  to occur as soon as practicable after the Effective
Time. In  addition, following the execution and delivery of

 


 

 

 

 

 

 

 

9  

 

 

 

 

 


 

this  Agreement, FNFG will cause First Niagara Bank, and GLB will cause GBSB,
to  execute and deliver a mutually acceptable Plan of Bank Merger.

 

 

2.10. _Additional  Actions_

 

 

If,  at  any time after the Effective Time, FNFG shall consider or be
advised that  any  further deeds, assignments or assurances in law or any
other acts are necessary  or desirable to (i) vest, perfect or confirm, of
record or otherwise, in  FNFG its right, title or interest in, to or under
any of the rights, properties  or assets of GLB, GBSB, or (ii) otherwise
carry out the purposes of this  Agreement, GLB and its officers and directors
shall be deemed to have granted  to  FNFG an irrevocable power of attorney
to execute and deliver, in such official  corporate capacities, all such
deeds, assignments or assurances in law or  any  other acts as are necessary
or desirable to (a) vest, perfect or confirm,  of record or otherwise, in
FNFG its right, title or interest in, to or under  any  of the rights,
properties or assets of GLB or (b) otherwise carry out the  purposes of this
Agreement, and the officers and directors of the FNFG are  authorized in the
name of GLB or otherwise to take any and all such  action.

the part  of  FNFG, GLB or the holders of any of the shares of GLB Common
Stock, the Merger  shall be effected in accordance with the following terms:

 

 

3.1.1. Each  share of FNFG Common Stock that is issued and outstanding
immediately prior  to  the Effective Time shall remain issued and
outstanding following the Effective  Time and shall be unchanged by the
Merger.

 

 

3.1.2. All  shares of GLB Common Stock held in the treasury of GLB ("Treasury
Stock") and  each share of GLB Common Stock owned by FNFG immediately prior
to the Effective  Time (other than shares held in a fiduciary capacity or in
connection with  debts  previously contracted) shall, at the Effective Time,
cease to exist, and  the  certificates for such shares shall be canceled as
promptly as practicable  thereafter, and no payment or distribution shall be
made in consideration  therefor.

 

 

3.1.3. Subject  to the provisions of this Article III, each share of GLB
Common Stock issued  and  outstanding immediately prior to the Effective
Time (other than Treasury  Stock  and Dissenting Shares) shall become and be
converted into, as provided in  and  subject to the limitations set forth in
this Agreement, the right to receive  at  the election of the holder thereof
as provided in Section 3.2, the following,  without interest:

 

 

(A) for  each share of GLB Common Stock with respect to which an election to
receive  cash  has been effectively made and not revoked or lost, pursuant
to Section 3.2  (a "Cash Election"), cash from FNFG in an amount equal to
$14.00 (the "Cash  Consideration") (collectively, "Cash Election Shares");

 


 

 

 

 

 

 

 

10  

 

 

 

 

 


 

(B) for  each share of GLB Common Stock with respect to which an election to
receive  FNFG  Common Stock has been effectively made and not revoked or
lost, pursuant  to  Section 3.2 (a "Stock Election"), .993 shares ("the
Exchange Ratio") of FNFG  Common (the "Stock Consideration") (collectively,
the "Stock Election  Shares");

 

 

(C) a  combination of the Cash Consideration and the Stock Consideration (a
"Mixed  Election" and collectively the "Mixed Election Shares"); and

 

 

(D) for  each share of GLB Common Stock other than shares as to which a Cash
Election,  a  Stock Election or a Mixed Election has been effectively made
and not revoked  or  lost, pursuant to Section 3.2 (collectively, "Non-
Election Shares"), such Stock  Consideration and/or Cash Consideration as is
determined in accordance with  Section 3.2.

 

 

3.1.4. Each  outstanding share of GLB Common Stock the holder of which has
perfected his  right to dissent under the DGCL and has not effectively
withdrawn or lost  such  right as of the Effective Time (the "Dissenting
Shares") shall not be converted  into or represent a right to receive the
Merger Consideration hereunder,  and the  holder thereof shall be entitled
only to such rights as are granted by the  DGCL. GLB shall give FNFG prompt
notice upon receipt by GLB of any  written demand for payment of the fair
value of such shares of GLB Common  Stock  and of withdrawals of such notice
and any other instruments provided pursuant  to  applicable law (any
shareholder duly making such demand being hereinafter  called  a "Dissenting
Shareholder"), and FNFG shall have the right to participate in all 
negotiations and proceedings with respect to any such demands. GLB  shall
not, except with the prior written consent of FNFG, voluntarily make  any 
payment with respect to, or settle or offer to settle, any such demand for 
payment, or waive any failure to timely deliver a written demand for
appraisal  or the taking of any other action by such Dissenting Shareholder
as may be  necessary to perfect appraisal rights under the DGCL. Any payments
made in  respect of Dissenting Shares shall be made by the Surviving 
Company.

 

 

3.1.5. If  any Dissenting Shareholder shall effectively withdraw or lose
(through failure  to perfect or otherwise) his right to such payment at or
prior to the Effective  Time, such holder's shares of GLB Common Stock shall
be converted into a right  to receive cash or FNFG Common Stock in accordance
with the applicable  provisions of this Agreement. If such holder shall
effectively  withdraw or lose (through failure to perfect or otherwise) his
right to such  payment after the Effective Time (or the Election Deadline),
each share of  GLB  Common Stock of such holder shall be treated as a Non-
Election  Share.

 

 

3.1.6. After  the Effective Time, shares of GLB Common Stock shall be no
longer outstanding  and shall automatically be canceled and shall cease to
exist, and shall  thereafter by operation of this section represent the right
to receive the  Merger Consideration (or as to Dissenting Shares, such rights
as provided  by the  DGCL) and any dividends or distributions with respect
thereto or any dividends  or distributions with a record date prior to the
Effective Time that were  declared or made by GLB on such shares of GLB
Common Stock in accordance  with  the terms of this Agreement on or prior to
the Effective Time and which remain  unpaid at the Effective Time.

 


 

 

 

 

 

 

 

11

the number  of, or provides for the exchange of, shares of FNFG Common Stock
issued and  outstanding prior to the Effective Time as a result of a stock
split, stock  dividend, recapitalization, reclassification, or similar
transaction with  respect to the outstanding FNFG Common Stock and the record
date therefor  shall  be prior to the Effective Time, the Exchange Ratio
shall be proportionately  and  appropriately adjusted; _provided_ , _that_
no such adjustment shall be  made with regard to FNFG Common Stock if FNFG
issues additional shares of  Common  Stock and receives fair market value
consideration for such shares.

 

 

3.2. _Election  Procedures._

 

 

3.2.1. Holders  of GLB Common Stock may elect to receive shares of FNFG
Common Stock or cash  (in  either case without interest) in exchange for
their shares of GLB Common  Stock  in accordance with the procedures set
forth herein; provided that, in the  aggregate, and subject to the provisions
of 3.2, 50% of the total number  of  shares of GLB Common Stock issued and
outstanding at the Effective Time,  including any Dissenting Shares but
excluding any Treasury Shares (the "Stock  Conversion Number"), shall be
converted into the Stock Consideration and the  remaining outstanding shares
of GLB Common Stock shall be converted into  the  Cash Consideration. Shares
of GLB Common Stock as to which a Cash  Election (including, pursuant to a
Mixed Election) has been made are referred  to  herein as "Cash Election
Shares." Shares of GLB Common Stock as to  which a Stock Election has been
made (including, pursuant to a Mixed Election)  are referred to as "Stock
Election Shares." Shares of GLB Common  Stock as to which no election has
been made (or as to which an Election Form  is  not returned properly
completed) are referred to herein as "Non-Election  Shares." The aggregate
number of shares of GLB Common Stock with  respect to which a Stock Election
has been made is referred to herein as  the "Stock Election Number." Any
Dissenting Shares shall be deemed to be  Cash Election Shares, and the
holders thereof shall in no event receive  consideration comprised of FNFG
Common Stock with respect to such shares;  provided; however, that for
purposes of making the proration calculations  provided for in this Section
3.2, only Dissenting Shares as existing at the  Effective Time shall be
deemed Cash Election Shares.

 

 

3.2.2. An  election form and other appropriate and customary transmittal
materials (which  shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of
loss and title  to the  Certificates shall pass, only upon proper delivery
of such Certificates to  the  Exchange Agent), in such form as GLB and FNFG
shall mutually agree ("Election  Form"), shall be mailed no more than 40
business days and no less than 20  business days prior to the anticipated
Effective Time or on such earlier  date as  FNFG and GLB shall mutually
agree (the "Mailing Date") to each holder of record  of GLB Common Stock as
of five business days prior to the Mailing Date (the  "Election Form Record
Date"). Each Election Form shall permit such  holder, subject to the
allocation and election procedures set forth in this  Section 3.2, (i) to
elect to receive the Cash Consideration for all of the  shares of GLB Common
Stock held by such holder, in accordance with Section  3.1.3, (ii) to elect
to receive the Stock Consideration for all of such shares,  in accordance
with Section 3.1.3, (iii) elect to receive the Stock Consideration  for a
part of such holder's GLB Common Stock and the Cash consideration for the 
remaining part of such holder's GLB Common Stock, or (iv) to indicate that
such  record holder has no preference as to the receipt of cash or FNFG
Common  Stock  for such shares. A holder of record of shares of GLB Common
Stock who  holds such shares as nominee, trustee or in another
representative  capacity

 


 

 

 

 

 

 

 

12  

 

 

 

 

 


 

(a  "Representative") may submit multiple Election Forms, provided that each
such  Election Form covers all the shares of GLB Common Stock held by such 
Representative for a particular beneficial owner. Any shares of GLB  Common
Stock with respect to which the holder thereof shall not, as of the  Election
Deadline, have made an election by submission to the Exchange Agent  of  an
effective, properly completed Election Form shall be deemed Non-Election 
Shares.

 

 

3.2.3. To  be effective, a properly completed Election Form shall be
submitted to the  Exchange Agent on or before 5:00 p.m., New York City time,
on the 20th day following  the  Mailing Date (or such other time and date as
FNFG and GLB may mutually agree)  (the "Election Deadline"); provided,
however, that the Election Deadline may not  occur on or after the Closing
Date. GLB shall use its reasonable best  efforts to make available up to two
separate Election Forms, or such additional  Election Forms as FNFG may
permit, to all persons who become holders (or  beneficial owners) of GLB
Common Stock between the Election Form Record Date  and  the close of
business on the business day prior to the Election  Deadline. GLB shall
provide to the Exchange Agent all information  reasonably necessary for it to
perform as specified herein. An  election shall have been properly made only
if the Exchange Agent shall have  actually received a properly completed
Election Form by the Election  Deadline. An Election Form shall be deemed
properly completed only if  accompanied by one or more Certificates (or
customary affidavits and  indemnification regarding the loss or destruction
of such Certificates or  the  guaranteed delivery of such Certificates)
representing all shares of GLB  Common  Stock covered by such Election Form,
together with duly executed transmittal  materials included with the Election
Form. If an GLB shareholder  either (i) does not submit a properly completed
Election Form in a timely  fashion or (ii) revokes its Election Form prior to
the Election Deadline  (without later submitting a properly completed
Election Form prior to the  Election Deadline), the shares of GLB Common
Stock held by such shareholder  shall be designated as Non-Election Shares.
Any Election Form may be  revoked or changed by the person submitting such
Election Form to the Exchange  Agent by written notice to the Exchange Agent
only if such notice of revocation  or change is actually received by the
Exchange Agent at or prior to the Election  Deadline. FNFG shall cause the
Certificate or Certificates relating  to any revoked Election Form to be
promptly returned without charge to the  person submitting the Election Form
to the Exchange Agent. Subject to  the terms of this Agreement and of the
Election Form, the Exchange Agent  shall  have discretion to determine when
any election, modification or revocation  is  received and whether any such
election, modification or revocation has been  properly made. All elections
shall be revoked automatically if the  Exchange Agent is notified in writing
by FNFG or GLB, upon exercise by FNFG  or  GLB of its respective or their
mutual rights to terminate this Agreement  to the  extent provided under
Article XI, that this Agreement has been terminated  in  accordance with
Article XI.

 

 

3.2.4. If  the aggregate number of shares of GLB Common Stock with respect to
which  Stock  Elections shall have been made (the "Stock Election Number")
exceeds the Stock  Conversion Number, then all Cash Election Shares and all
Non-Election Shares  of  each holder thereof shall be converted into the
right to receive the Cash  Consideration, and Stock Election Shares of each
holder thereof will be  converted into the right to receive the Stock
Consideration in respect of  that  number of Stock Election Shares equal to
the product obtained by multiplying  (x)  the number of Stock Election
Shares held by such holder by (y) a fraction,  the  numerator of which is
the Stock Conversion Number and the denominator of  which  is the Stock
Election

 


 

 

 

 

 

 

 

13  

 

 

 

 

 


 

Number,  with the remaining number of such holder's Stock Election Shares
being converted  into the right to receive the Cash Consideration.

 

 

3.2.5.   If the Stock Election Number is less than the Stock Conversion
Number (the  amount by which the Stock Conversion Number exceeds the Stock
Election Number  being referred to herein as the "Shortfall Number"), then
all Stock Election  Shares shall be converted into the right to receive the
Stock Consideration  and  the Non-Election Shares and Cash Election Shares
shall be treated in the  following manner:

 

 

(A) If  the Shortfall Number is less than or equal to the number of Non-
Election  Shares,  then all Cash Election Shares shall be converted into the
right to receive  the  Cash Consideration and the Non-Election Shares of
each holder thereof shall  convert into the right to receive the Stock
Consideration in respect of that  number of Non-Election Shares equal to the
product obtained by multiplying  (x)  the number of Non-Election Shares held
by such holder by (y) a fraction,  the  numerator of which is the Shortfall
Number and the denominator of which is  the  total number of Non-Election
Shares, with the remaining number of such holder's  Non-Election Shares being
converted into the right to receive the Cash  Consideration; or

 

 

(B) If  the Shortfall Number exceeds the number of Non-Election Shares, then
all  Non-Election Shares shall be converted into the right to receive the
Stock  Consideration and Cash Election Shares of each holder thereof shall
convert  into  the right to receive the Stock Consideration in respect of
that number of  Cash  Election Shares equal to the product obtained by
multiplying (x) the number  of  Cash Election Shares held by such holder by
(y) a fraction, the numerator  of  which is the amount by which (1) the
Shortfall Number exceeds (2) the total  number of Non-Election Shares and the
denominator of which is the total number  of Cash Election Shares, with the
remaining number of such holder's Cash  Election Shares being converted into
the right to receive the Cash  Consideration.

 

 

3.2.6. _Adjustment  to Preserve Tax Treatment._ Notwithstanding anything in
this Article III to  the contrary, if the aggregate value of the Stock
Consideration to be delivered  as of the Effective Time, less the amount of
cash paid in lieu of fractional  shares of FNFG Common Stock pursuant to
Section 3.2.7 (the "Stock Value"), is  less than 40% of the sum of (i) the
aggregate value of the Merger Consideration  to be delivered as of the
Effective Time, plus (ii) the value of any  consideration described in
Treasury Regulations Section 1.368-1(e)(1)(ii),  plus  (iii) cash paid to
holders of Dissenting Shares, plus (iv) the value of any  consideration paid
by FNFG or any of its Subsidiaries (or any "related person" to FNFG or any of
its Subsidiaries within the meaning of Treasury Regulations  Section
1.368-1(e)(3)) to acquire shares of GLB Common Stock prior to the  Effective
Time (such sum, the "Aggregate Value"), then FNFG may reduce the  number of
shares of outstanding GLB Common Stock entitled to receive the  Cash 
Consideration and correspondingly increase the number of shares of GLB
Common  Stock entitled to receive the Stock Consideration by the minimum
amount  necessary to cause the Stock Value to equal 40% of the Aggregate 
Value.

 

 

3.2.7. _No  Fractional Shares._ Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
contained  herein, no certificates or scrip representing fractional shares of
FNFG Common  Stock shall be issued upon the surrender for exchange of
Certificates, no  dividend or distribution with respect to FNFG Common Stock
shall be payable  on  or with respect to any fractional share interest, and

 


 

 

 

 

 

 

 

14  

 

 

 

 

 


 

such  fractional share interests shall not entitle the owner thereof to vote
or  to any  other rights of a shareholder of FNFG. In lieu of the issuance
of any  such fractional share, FNFG shall pay to each former holder of GLB
Common  Stock  who otherwise would be entitled to receive a fractional share
of FNFG Common  Stock, an amount in cash, rounded to the nearest cent and
without interest,  equal to the product of (i) the fraction of a share to
which such holder  would  otherwise have been entitled and (ii) the average
of the daily closing sales  prices of a share of FNFG Common Stock as
reported on the Nasdaq for the  five  consecutive trading days immediately
preceding the Closing Date. For  purposes of determining any fractional share
interest, all shares of GLB  Common  Stock owned by a GLB shareholder shall
be combined so as to calculate the  maximum number of whole shares of FNFG
Common Stock issuable to such GLB  shareholder.

 

 

3.3. _Procedures  for Exchange of GLB Common Stock._

 

 

3.3.1. _FNFG  to Make Merger Consideration Available._ After the Election 
Deadline and no later than the Closing Date, FNFG shall deposit, or shall 
cause  to be deposited, with the Exchange Agent for the benefit of the
holders of  GLB  Common Stock, for exchange in accordance with this Section
3.3, certificates  representing the shares of FNFG Common Stock and an
aggregate amount of cash  sufficient to pay the aggregate amount of cash
payable pursuant to this Article  III (including any cash that may be payable
in lieu of any fractional shares  of  GLB Common Stock) (such cash and
certificates for shares of FNFG Common Stock,  together with any dividends or
distributions with respect thereto, being  hereinafter referred to as the
"Exchange Fund").

 

 

3.3.2. _Exchange  of Certificates_. FNFG shall take all steps necessary to
cause  the Exchange Agent, within five (5) business days after the Effective
Time,  to  mail to each holder of a Certificate or Certificates, a form
letter of  transmittal for return to the Exchange Agent and instructions for
use in  effecting the surrender of the Certificates for the Merger
Consideration  and  cash in lieu of fractional shares, if any, into which
the GLB Common Stock  represented by such Certificates shall have been
converted as a result of  the  Merger. The letter of transmittal shall
specify that delivery shall  be effected, and risk of loss and title to the
Certificates shall pass, only  upon delivery of the Certificates to the
Exchange Agent. Upon proper surrender  of a Certificate for exchange and
cancellation to the Exchange Agent, together  with a properly completed
letter of transmittal, duly executed, the holder  of  such Certificate shall
be entitled to receive in exchange therefor, as  applicable, (i) a
certificate representing that number of shares of FNFG  Common  Stock (if
any) to which such former holder of GLB Common Stock shall have  become 
entitled pursuant to the provisions of Section 3.1 or 3.2 hereof, (ii) a 
check  representing that amount of cash (if any) to which such former holder
of  GLB  Common Stock shall have become entitled pursuant to the provisions
of Section  3.1 or 3.2 hereof and (iii) a check representing the amount of
cash (if any)  payable in lieu of fractional shares of FNFG Common Stock,
which such former  holder has the right to receive in respect of the
Certificate surrendered  pursuant to the provisions of Section 3.2, and the
Certificate so surrendered  shall forthwith be cancelled. No interest will be
paid or accrued on  the cash payable in lieu of fractional shares.
Certificates  surrendered for exchange by any person who is an "affiliate" of
GLB for purposes  of Rule 145(c) under the Securities Act shall not be
exchanged for certificates  representing shares of FNFG Common Stock until
FNFG has received the written  agreement of such person contemplated by
Section 8.4 hereof.

 


 

 

 

 

 

 

 

15  

 

 

 

 

 


 

3.3.3. _Rights  of Certificate Holders after the Effective Time_. The holder
of a  Certificate that prior to the Merger represented issued and outstanding
GLB  Common Stock shall have no rights, after the Effective Time, with
respect  to  such GLB Common Stock except to surrender the Certificate in
exchange for  the  Merger Consideration as provided in this Agreement (or as
to Dissenting Shares,  such rights as provided by the DGCL). No dividends or
other  distributions declared after the Effective Time with respect to FNFG
Common  Stock shall be paid to the holder of any unsurrendered Certificate
until  the  holder thereof shall surrender such Certificate in accordance
with this Section  3.3. After the surrender of a Certificate in accordance
with this  Section 3.3, the record holder thereof shall be entitled to
receive any such  dividends or other distributions, without any interest
thereon, which  theretofore had become payable with respect to shares of FNFG
Common Stock  represented by such Certificate.

 

 

3.3.4. _Surrender  by Persons Other than Record Holders_. If the Person
surrendering  a Certificate and signing the accompanying letter of
transmittal is not the  record holder thereof, then it shall be a condition
of the payment of the  Merger  Consideration that: (i) such Certificate is
properly endorsed to such  Person or is accompanied by appropriate stock
powers, in either case signed  exactly as the name of the record holder
appears on such Certificate, and  is  otherwise in proper form for transfer,
or is accompanied by appropriate evidence  of the authority of the Person
surrendering such Certificate and signing  the  letter of transmittal to do
so on behalf of the record holder; and (ii) the  person requesting such
exchange shall pay to the Exchange Agent in advance  any  transfer or other
taxes required by reason of the payment to a person other  than  the
registered holder of the Certificate surrendered, or required for any 
other  reason, or shall establish to the satisfaction of the Exchange Agent
that  such  tax has been paid or is not payable.

 

 

3.3.5. _Closing  of Transfer Books_. From and after the Effective Time, there
shall be no  transfers on the stock transfer books of GLB of the GLB Common
Stock that  were  outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time. If,
after the  Effective Time, Certificates representing such shares are
presented for transfer  to the Exchange Agent, they shall be exchanged for
the Merger Consideration  and  canceled as provided in this Section 3.3.

 

 

3.3.6. _Return  of Exchange Fund_. At any time following the six (6) month
period after the  Effective Time, FNFG shall be entitled to require the
Exchange Agent to deliver  to it any portions of the Exchange Fund which had
been made available to  the  Exchange Agent and not disbursed to holders of
Certificates (including, without  limitation, all interest and other income
received by the Exchange Agent  in  respect of all funds made available to
it), and thereafter such holders shall  be  entitled to look to FNFG
(subject to abandoned property, escheat and other  similar laws) with respect
to any Merger Consideration that may be payable  upon  due surrender of the
Certificates held by them. Notwithstanding the foregoing,  neither FNFG nor
the Exchange Agent shall be liable to any holder of a  Certificate for any
Merger Consideration delivered in respect of such  Certificate to a public
official pursuant to any abandoned property, escheat  or  other similar law.

 

 

3.3.7. _Lost,  Stolen or Destroyed Certificates_. In the event any
Certificate  shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an
affidavit  of  that fact by the person claiming such Certificate to be lost,
stolen or  destroyed and, if required by FNFG, the posting by such person of
a bond  in such  amount as FNFG may reasonably direct as indemnity against
any

 


 

 

 

 

 

 

 

16  

 

 

 

 

 


 

claim  that may be made against it with respect to such Certificate, the
Exchange  Agent  will issue in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed
Certificate the  Merger  Consideration deliverable in respect thereof.

 

 

3.3.8. _Withholding._ FNFG  or the Exchange Agent will be entitled to deduct
and withhold from the  consideration otherwise payable pursuant to this
Agreement or the transactions  contemplated hereby to any holder of GLB
Common Stock such amounts as FNFG  (or  any Affiliate thereof) or the
Exchange Agent are required to deduct and withhold  with respect to the
making of such payment under the Code, or any applicable  provision of U.S.
federal, state, local or non-U.S. tax law. To the  extent that such amounts
are properly withheld by FNFG or the Exchange Agent,  such withheld amounts
will be treated for all purposes of this Agreement  as  having been paid to
the holder of the GLB Common Stock in respect of whom  such  deduction and
withholding were made by FNFG or the Exchange Agent.

 

 

3.3.9. _Treatment  of GLB Options_. GLB DISCLOSURE SCHEDULE 4.3.1 sets forth
all of  the outstanding GLB Options as of the date hereof. Prior to and 
effective as of the Effective Time, GLB shall take all actions necessary 
to  terminate the GLB Option Plans (and all other option plans listed in
GLB  DISCLOSURE SCHEDULE 4.9.1(ii). Holders of all unexercised GLB Options 
as of the Effective Time will receive, in cancellation of their GLB Options, 
a  cash payment from GLB immediately prior to the Effective Time, in an
amount  equal to the product of (x) the number of shares of GLB Common Stock
provided  for in such GLB Option and (y) the excess, if any, of $14.00 over
the exercise  price per share provided for in such GLB Option (the "Cash
Option Payment"),  which cash payment shall be treated as compensation and
shall be net of any  applicable federal or state withholding tax. Prior to
the Effective  Time, GLB shall use its reasonably best efforts to obtain the
written consent  of  each option holder to the cancellation of the GLB
Options in exchange for  the  Cash Option Payment, provided that the failure
to obtain each consent shall  not  be a breach of this agreement, provided
further that the execution of this  Agreement confirms the agreement of
Andrew W. Dorn, Jr., Michael J. Rogers  and  Peter B. Babiarz, and the
current directors of GLB, to enter into such written  consent.

 

 

3.3.10. _3.4_ Reservation  of Shares. FNFG shall reserve for issuance a
sufficient number of  shares of the FNFG Common Stock for the purpose of
issuing shares of FNFG  Common  Stock to the GLB shareholders in accordance
with this Article III.

circumstance or event unless such fact, circumstance or event, individually

4.6.4. The  records, systems, controls, data and information of GLB and its
Subsidiaries  are  recorded, stored, maintained and operated under means
(including any electronic,  mechanical or photographic process, whether
computerized or not) that are  under  the exclusive ownership and direct
control of GLB or its Subsidiaries or  accountants (including all means of
access thereto and therefrom), except  for  any non-exclusive ownership and
non-direct control that would not reasonably  be  expected to have a
material adverse effect on the system of internal accounting  controls
described below in this Section 4.6.4. GLB (x) has  implemented and maintains
a system of internal control over financial reporting  (as required by Rule
13a-15(a) of the Exchange Act) that is designed to provide  reasonable
assurances regarding the reliability of financial reporting and  the 
preparation of its financial statements for external purposes in accordance 
with  GAAP, (y) has implemented and maintains disclosure controls and
procedures  (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) of the Exchange Act) to ensure that
material  information relating to GLB, including its consolidated
Subsidiaries, is  made  known to the chief executive officer and the chief
financial officer of GLB  by  others within those entities, and (z) has
disclosed, based on its most  recent evaluation prior to the date hereof, to
GLB's outside auditors and the  audit

 


 

 

 

 

 

 

 

21  

 

 

 

 

 


 

committee  of GLB's Board of Directors (i) any significant deficiencies and
material  weaknesses in the design or operation of internal control over
financial  reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) of the Exchange Act) which
are  reasonably likely to adversely affect GLB's ability to record,
process,  summarize and report financial information and (ii) any fraud,
whether or  not material, that involves management or other employees who
have a significant  role in GLB's internal control over financial reporting.
These disclosures (if  any) were made in writing by management to GLB's
auditors and audit committee  and a copy has previously been made available
to FNFG. As of the date hereof,  to  the knowledge of GLB, its chief
executive officer and chief financial officer  will be able to give the
certifications required pursuant to the rules and  regulations adopted
pursuant to Section 302 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act,  without qualification,
when next due.

 

 

4.6.5. Since  June 30, 2006, (i) neither GLB nor any of its Subsidiaries nor,
to the  Knowledge of GLB, any director, officer, employee, auditor,
accountant or  representative of GLB or any of its Subsidiaries has received
or otherwise  had  or obtained knowledge of any material complaint,
allegation, assertion or  claim,  whether written or oral, regarding the
accounting or auditing practices,  procedures, methodologies or methods of
GLB or any of its Subsidiaries or  their  respective internal accounting
controls, including any material complaint,  allegation, assertion or claim
that GLB or any of its Subsidiaries has engaged  in questionable accounting
or auditing practices, and (ii) no attorney  representing GLB or any of its
Subsidiaries, whether or not employed by GLB  or  any of its Subsidiaries,
has reported evidence of a material violation of  Securities Laws, breach of
fiduciary duty or similar violation by GLB or  any of  its officers,
directors, employees or agents to the Board of Directors of  GLB or  any
committee thereof or to any director or officer of GLB.

 

 

4.7. _Taxes._

 

 

Except  as  set forth in GLB DISCLOSURE SCHEDULE 4.7(a), GLB and the GLB
Subsidiaries  that  are at least 80 percent owned by GLB are members of the
same affiliated group  within the meaning of Code Section 1504(a). GLB has
duly filed all federal,  state and material local tax returns required to be
filed by or with respect  to  GLB and every GLB Subsidiary on or prior to
the Closing Date, taking into  account any extensions (all such returns, to
GLB's Knowledge, being accurate and  correct in all material respects) and
has duly paid or made provisions for  the  payment of all material federal,
state and local taxes which have been incurred  by or are due or claimed to
be due from GLB and any GLB Subsidiary by any  taxing  authority or pursuant
to any written tax sharing agreement on or prior to  the  Closing Date other
than taxes or other charges which (i) are not delinquent,  (ii) are being
contested in good faith, or (iii) have not yet been fully  determined. Except
as set forth in GLB DISCLOSURE  SCHEDULE 4.7(b), as of the date of this
Agreement, GLB has received no  written notice of, and to GLB's Knowledge
there is no audit examination,  deficiency assessment, tax investigation or
refund litigation with respect  to  any taxes of GLB or any of its
Subsidiaries, and no claim has been made by  any  authority in a
jurisdiction where GLB or any of its Subsidiaries do not file  tax  returns
that GLB or any such Subsidiary is subject to taxation in that  jurisdiction.
Except as set forth in GLB DISCLOSURE  SCHEDULE 4.7(c), GLB and its
Subsidiaries have not executed an extension or  waiver of any statute of
limitations on the assessment or collection of any  material tax due that is
currently in effect. GLB and each of its Subsidiaries  has withheld and paid
all taxes required to have been withheld and paid in  connection with amounts
paid or owing to any employee,

 


 

 

 

 

 

 

 

22  

 

 

 

 

 


 

independent  contractor, creditor, shareholder or other third party, and GLB
and each  of its  Subsidiaries, to GLB's Knowledge, has timely complied with
all applicable  information reporting requirements under Part III, Subchapter
A of Chapter  61 of  the Code and similar applicable state and local
information reporting  requirements.

 

 

4.8. _No  Material Adverse Effect._

 

 

GLB  has  not suffered any Material Adverse Effect since December 31, 2006
and no event  has occurred or circumstance arisen since that date which, in
the aggregate,  has  had or is reasonably likely to have a Material Adverse
Effect on  GLB.

 

 

4.9. _Material  Contracts; Leases; Defaults._

 

 

4.9.1. Except  as set forth in GLB DISCLOSURE SCHEDULE 4.9.1, neither GLB nor
any GLB  Subsidiary is a party to or subject to: (i) any employment,
consulting or  severance contract or material arrangement with any past or
present officer,  director or employee of GLB or any GLB Subsidiary, except
for "at will" arrangements; (ii) any plan, material arrangement or contract
providing for  bonuses, pensions, options, deferred compensation, retirement
payments, profit  sharing or similar material arrangements for or with any

relating to employees  of  GLB or any GLB Subsidiary; (iv) any agreement
which by its terms limits the  payment of dividends by GLB or any GLB
Subsidiary; (v) any instrument evidencing  or related to material
indebtedness for borrowed money whether directly or  indirectly, by way of
purchase money obligation, conditional sale, lease  purchase, guaranty or
otherwise, in respect of which GLB or any GLB Subsidiary  is an obligor to
any person, which instrument evidences or relates to  indebtedness other than
deposits, repurchase agreements, FHLB advances, bankers' acceptances, and
"treasury tax and loan" accounts and transactions in "federal  funds" in each
case established in the ordinary course of business consistent  with past
practice, or which contains financial covenants or other restrictions  (other
than those relating to the payment of principal and interest when  due) 
which would be applicable on or after the Closing Date to FNFG or any FNFG 
Subsidiary; (vi) any other agreement, written or oral, that obligates GLB  or
any  GLB Subsidiary for the payment of more than $50,000 annually or for the
payment  of more than $100,000 over its remaining term, which is not
terminable without  cause on 60 days' or less notice without penalty or
payment, or (vii) any  agreement (other than this Agreement), contract,
arrangement, commitment  or  understanding (whether written or oral) that
restricts or limits in any material  way the conduct of business by GLB or
any GLB Subsidiary (it being understood  that any non-compete or similar
provision shall be deemed  material).

 

 

4.9.2. Each  real estate lease that requires the consent of the lessor or its
agent resulting  from the Merger or the Bank Merger by virtue of the terms of
any such lease,  is  listed in GLB DISCLOSURE SCHEDULE 4.9.2 identifying the
section of the lease  that contains such prohibition or restriction. Subject
to any  consents that may be required as a result of the transactions
contemplated  by  this Agreement, to its Knowledge, neither GLB nor any GLB
Subsidiary is in  default in any material respect under any material
contract, agreement,  commitment, arrangement, lease, insurance policy or
other instrument to which  it  is a party, by which its assets, business, or
operations may be bound or  affected, or under which it or its assets,

 


 

 

 

 

 

 

 

23  

 

 

 

 

 


 

business,  or operations receive benefits, and there has not occurred any
event that,  with  the lapse of time or the giving of notice or both, would
constitute such  a  default.

 

 

4.9.3. True  and correct copies of agreements, contracts, arrangements and
instruments  referred to in Section 4.9.1 and 4.9.2 have been made available
to FNFG on  or  before the date hereof, and are in full force and effect on
the date hereof  and  neither GLB nor any GLB Subsidiary (nor, to the
Knowledge of GLB, any other  party to any such contract, arrangement or
instrument) has materially breached  any provision of, or is in default in
any respect under any term of, any  such  contract, arrangement or
instrument, except as set forth in GLB DISCLOSURE  SCHEDULE 4.9.3(a). Except
as listed on GLB DISCLOSURE  SCHEDULE 4.9.3(b), no party to any material
contract, arrangement or  instrument will have the right to terminate any or
all of the provisions  of any  such contract, arrangement or instrument as a
result of the execution of,  and  the consummation of the transactions
contemplated by, this  Agreement. Except as set forth in GLB DISCLOSURE
SCHEDULE 4.9.3(c),  no plan, contract, employment agreement, termination
agreement, or similar  agreement or arrangement to which GLB or any GLB
Subsidiary is a party or  under  which GLB or any GLB Subsidiary may be
liable contains provisions which permit  an employee or independent
contractor to terminate it without cause and continue  to accrue future
benefits thereunder. Except as set forth in GLB  DISCLOSURE SCHEDULE
4.9.3(d), no such agreement, plan, contract, or arrangement  (x) provides for
acceleration in the vesting of benefits or payments due  thereunder upon the
occurrence of a change in ownership or control of GLB  or any  GLB
Subsidiary or upon the occurrence of a subsequent event; or (y) requires 
GLB  or any GLB Subsidiary to provide a benefit in the form of GLB Common
Stock  or  determined by reference to the value of GLB Common Stock.

 

 

4.9.4. Since  December 31, 2006, through and including the date of this
Agreement, except  as publicly disclosed by GLB in the Securities Documents
filed or furnished  by  GLB prior to the date hereof, neither GLB nor any
GLB Subsidiary has  (i) except for (A) normal increases for employees (other
than officers  and directors subject to the reporting requirements of Section
16(a) of the  Exchange Act) made in the ordinary course of business
consistent with past  practice, or (B) as required by applicable law,
increased the wages,  salaries, compensation, pension, or other fringe
benefits or perquisites  payable  to any executive officer, employee, or
director from the amount thereof in  effect as of December 31, 2006 (which
amounts have been previously made  available to FNFG), granted any severance
or termination pay, entered into  any  contract to make or grant any
severance or termination pay (except as required  under the terms of
agreements or severance plans listed on GLB DISCLOSURE  SCHEDULE 4.13.1, as
in effect as of the date hereof), or paid any bonus  other than the customary
year-end bonuses in amounts consistent with past  practice, (ii) granted any
options to purchase shares of GLB Common Stock,  or any right to acquire any
shares of its capital stock to any executive  officer, director or employee
other than grants to employees (other than  officers subject to the reporting
requirements of Section 16(a) of the  Exchange Act) made in the ordinary
course of business consistent with past  practice under GLB Option Plans,
(iii) increased or established any bonus,  insurance, severance, deferred
compensation, pension, retirement, profit  sharing, stock option (including,
without limitation, the granting of stock  options, stock appreciation
rights, performance awards, or restricted stock  awards), stock purchase or
other employee benefit plan, (iv) made any  material election for federal or
state income tax purposes, (v) made any  material change in the credit
policies or procedures of GLB or any of  its

 


 

 

 

 

 

 

 

24  

 

 

 

 

 


 

Subsidiaries,  the effect of which was or is to make any such policy or
procedure less  restrictive in any material respect, (vi) made any material
acquisition or  disposition of any assets or properties, or any contract for
any such  acquisition or disposition entered into other than loans and loan
commitments,  (vii) entered into any lease of real or personal property
requiring annual  payments in excess of $100,000, other than in connection
with foreclosed  property or in the ordinary course of business consistent
with past practice,  (viii) changed any accounting methods, principles or
practices of GLB or  its Subsidiaries affecting its assets, liabilities or
businesses, including  any  reserving, renewal or residual method, practice
or policy or (ix) suffered  any strike, work stoppage, slow-down, or other
labor disturbance.

 

 

4.10. _Ownership  of Property; Insurance Coverage._

 

 

4.10.1. Except  as set forth in GLB DISCLOSURE SCHEDULE 4.10, GLB and each
GLB Subsidiary  has good and, as to real property, marketable title to all
material assets  and  properties owned by GLB or each GLB Subsidiary in the
conduct of its businesses,  whether such assets and properties are real or
personal, tangible or intangible,  including assets and property reflected in
the balance sheets contained in  the  GLB Regulatory Reports and in the GLB
Financial Statements or acquired  subsequent thereto (except to the extent
that such assets and properties  have  been disposed of in the ordinary
course of business, since the date of such  balance sheets), subject to no
material encumbrances, liens, mortgages, security  interests or pledges,
except (i) those items which secure liabilities for  public or statutory
obligations or any discount with, borrowing from or other  obligations to
FHLB, inter-bank credit facilities, or any transaction by  an GLB 
Subsidiary acting in a fiduciary capacity, (ii) statutory liens for amounts 
not  yet delinquent or which are being contested in good faith, (iii) non-
monetary  liens affecting real property which do not materially and adversely
affect  the  value or use of such real property, and (iv) those described
and reflected  in  the GLB Financial Statements. GLB and the GLB
Subsidiaries, as lessee, have  the  right under valid and existing leases of
real and personal properties used  by  GLB and its Subsidiaries in the
conduct of their businesses to occupy or  use all  such properties as
presently occupied and used by each of them.

 

 

4.10.2. With  respect to all material agreements pursuant to which GLB or any
GLB Subsidiary  has purchased securities subject to an agreement to resell,
if any, GLB or  such  GLB Subsidiary, as the case may be, has a lien or
security interest (which  to  GLB's Knowledge is a valid, perfected first
lien) in the securities or other  collateral securing the repurchase
agreement, and the value of such collateral  equals or exceeds the amount of
the debt secured thereby.

 

 

4.10.3. GLB  and each GLB Subsidiary currently maintain insurance considered
by each of  them  to be reasonable for their respective operations. Neither
GLB nor any  GLB Subsidiary, except as disclosed in GLB DISCLOSURE SCHEDULE
4.10.3(a),  has received notice from any insurance carrier during the past
two years  that  (i) such insurance will be canceled or that coverage
thereunder will be reduced  or eliminated, or (ii) premium costs (other than
with respect to health or  disability insurance) with respect to such
policies of insurance will be  substantially increased. There are presently
no material claims pending under  such policies of insurance and no notices
have been given by GLB or any GLB  Subsidiary under such policies (other than
with respect to health or disability  insurance). All such insurance is valid
and enforceable and in full force  and  effect, and within the last two
years GLB and each GLB

 


 

 

 

 

 

 

 

25  

 

 

 

 

 


 

Subsidiary  has received each type of insurance coverage for which it has
applied and  during  such periods has not been denied indemnification for
any material claims  submitted under any of its insurance policies. GLB
DISCLOSURE SCHEDULE 4.10.3(b)  identifies all material policies of insurance
maintained by GLB and each  GLB  Subsidiary as well as the other matters
required to be disclosed under this  Section.

 

 

4.11. _Legal  Proceedings._

 

 

Except  as  set forth in GLB DISCLOSURE SCHEDULE 4.11, neither GLB nor any
GLB  Subsidiary is a party to any, and there are no pending or, to GLB's
Knowledge,  threatened legal, administrative, arbitration or other
proceedings, claims  (whether asserted or unasserted), actions or
governmental investigations  or  inquiries of any nature (i) against GLB or
any GLB Subsidiary, (ii) to which  GLB  or any GLB Subsidiary's assets are
or may be subject, (iii) challenging the  validity or propriety of any of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement,  or (iv) which could adversely
affect the ability of GLB or GBSB to perform  under  this Agreement, except,
in each of (i) through (iv) above, for any proceeding,  claim, action,
investigation or inquiry which, if adversely determined,  individually or in
the aggregate, would not be reasonably expected to have  a  Material Adverse
Effect on GLB.

 

 

4.12. _Compliance  With Applicable Law._

 

 

4.12.1. To  GLB's Knowledge, and except as set forth in GLB DISCLOSURE
SCHEDULE 4.12.1, each  of GLB and each GLB Subsidiary is in compliance in all
material respects  with  all applicable federal, state, local and foreign
statutes, laws, regulations,  ordinances, rules, judgments, orders or decrees
applicable to it, its  properties, assets and deposits, its business, and its
conduct of business  and  its relationship with its employees, including,
without limitation, the USA  Patriot Act, the Equal Credit Opportunity Act,
the Fair Housing Act, the  Community Reinvestment Act of 1977, the Home
Mortgage Disclosure Act, and  all  other applicable fair lending laws and
other laws relating to discriminatory  business practices and neither GLB nor
any GLB Subsidiary has received any  written notice to the contrary. The
Board of Directors of GBSB has  adopted and GBSB has implemented an anti-
money laundering program that contains  adequate and appropriate customer
identification verification procedures  that  has not been deemed
ineffective by any Governmental Authority and that meets  the  requirements
of Sections 352 and 326 of the USA Patriot Act and the regulations 
thereunder.

 

 

4.12.2. Each  of GLB and each GLB Subsidiary has all material permits,
licenses,  authorizations, orders and approvals of, and has made all filings,
applications  and registrations with, all Governmental Entities and Bank
Regulators that  are  required in order to permit it to own or lease its
properties and to conduct  its  business as presently conducted; all such
permits, licenses, certificates  of  authority, orders and approvals are in
full force and effect and, to the  Knowledge of GLB, no suspension or
cancellation of any such permit, license,  certificate, order or approval is
threatened or will result from the  consummation of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, subject  to  obtaining Regulatory Approvals.

 

 

4.12.3. For  the period beginning January 1, 2003 as to GBSB, and for the
period  beginning June 30, 2006 for GLB and each GLB Subsidiary (other than
GBSB),  neither GLB nor any GLB Subsidiary has received any written
notification  or, to  GLB's Knowledge, any other

 


 

 

 

 

 

 

 

26  

 

 

 

 

 


 

communication  from any Bank Regulator (i) asserting that GLB or any GLB
Subsidiary is not  in  material compliance with any of the statutes,
regulations or ordinances which  such Bank Regulator enforces; (ii)
threatening to revoke any license, franchise,  permit or governmental
authorization which is material to GLB or any GLB  Subsidiary; (iii)
requiring, or threatening to require, GLB or any GLB  Subsidiary, or
indicating that GLB or any GLB Subsidiary may be required,  to  enter into a
cease and desist order, agreement or memorandum of understanding  or  any
other agreement with any federal or state governmental agency or authority 
which is charged with the supervision or regulation of banks or engages in 
the  insurance of bank deposits restricting or limiting, or purporting to
restrict  or  limit, in any material respect the operations of GLB or any
GLB Subsidiary,  including without limitation any restriction on the payment
of dividends;  or  (iv) directing, restricting or limiting, or purporting to
direct, restrict  or  limit, in any manner the operations of GLB or any GLB
Subsidiary, including  without limitation any restriction on the payment of
dividends (any such  notice,  communication, memorandum, agreement or order
described in this sentence  is  hereinafter referred to as a "GLB Regulatory
Agreement"). Neither GLB nor any  GLB Subsidiary (other than GBSB) has
consented to or entered into any GLB  Regulatory Agreement that is currently
in effect or that was in effect since  June 30, 2006, and GBSB has not
consented to or entered into any GLB Regulatory  Agreement that is currently
in effect or that was in effect since June 30,  2003. The most recent
regulatory rating given to GBSB as to  compliance with the Community
Reinvestment Act ("CRA") is satisfactory or  better.

 

 

4.12.4. Since  December 31, 2006, GLB has been and is in compliance in all
material respects  with (i) the applicable provisions of the Sarbanes-Oxley
Act and  (ii) the applicable listing and corporate governance rules and
regulations  of the NYSE. GLB DISCLOSURE SCHEDULE 4.12.4 sets forth, as of 
July 31, 2007, a schedule of all executive officers and directors of GLB  who
have outstanding loans from GLB or GBSB, and there has been no default  on, 
or forgiveness or waiver of, in whole or in part, any such loan during the 
two  years immediately preceding the date hereof.

 

 

4.13. _Employee  Benefit Plans._

 

 

4.13.1. GLB  DISCLOSURE SCHEDULE 4.13.1 includes a descriptive list of all
existing bonus,  incentive, deferred compensation, pension, retirement,
profit-sharing, thrift,  savings, employee stock ownership, stock bonus,
stock purchase, restricted  stock, stock option, stock appreciation, phantom
stock, severance, welfare  benefit plans (including paid time off policies
and other benefit policies  and  procedures), fringe benefit plans,
employment, severance and change in control  agreements and all other
material benefit practices, policies and arrangements  maintained by GLB or
any GLB Subsidiary in which any employee or former  employee, consultant or
former consultant or director or former director  of GLB  or any GLB
Subsidiary participates or to which any such employee, consultant  or 
director is a party or is otherwise entitled to receive benefits (the "GLB 
Compensation and Benefit Plans"). Except as set forth in GLB  DISCLOSURE
SCHEDULE 4.13.1, neither GLB nor any of its Subsidiaries has any  commitment
to create any additional GLB Compensation and Benefit Plan or  to 
materially modify, change or renew any existing GLB Compensation and Benefit 
Plan (any modification or change that increases the cost of such plans would 
be  deemed material), except as required to maintain the qualified status
thereof,  GLB has made available to FNFG true and correct copies of the GLB
Compensation  and Benefit Plans.

 


 

 

 

 

 

 

 

27  

 

 

 

 

 


 

4.13.2. To  the Knowledge of GLB and except as disclosed in GLB DISCLOSURE
SCHEDULE 4.13.2,  each GLB Compensation and Benefit Plan has been operated
and administered  in all  material respects in accordance with its terms and
with applicable law,  including, but not limited to, ERISA, the Code, the
Securities Act, the Exchange  Act, the Age Discrimination in Employment Act,
COBRA, the Health Insurance  Portability and Accountability Act ("HIPAA") and
any regulations or rules  promulgated thereunder, and all material filings,
disclosures and notices  required by ERISA, the Code, the Securities Act, the
Exchange Act, the Age  Discrimination in Employment Act, COBRA and HIPAA and
any other applicable  law  have been timely made or any interest, fines,
penalties or other impositions  for  late filings have been paid in full.
Each GLB Compensation and  Benefit Plan which is an "employee pension benefit
plan" within the meaning of  Section 3(2) of ERISA (a "Pension Plan") and
which is intended to be qualified  under Section 401(a) of the Code, is
subject of a "Favorable Letter" within  the meaning of Rev. Proc. 2006-27
Section 5.01, and GLB is not aware of any  circumstances which are reasonably
likely to result in revocation of any  such  Favorable Letter. There is no
material pending or, to the Knowledge  of GLB, threatened action, suit or
claim relating to any of the GLB Compensation  and Benefit Plans (other than
routine claims for benefits). Neither  GLB nor any GLB Subsidiary has engaged
in a transaction, or omitted to take  any  action, with respect to any GLB
Compensation and Benefit Plan that would  reasonably be expected to subject
GLB or any GLB Subsidiary to an unpaid  tax or  penalty imposed by either
Section 4975 of the Code or Section 502 of  ERISA.

 

 

4.13.3.   GLB does not maintain any defined benefit pension plan. To the 
Knowledge of GLB, and except as set forth in GLB DISCLOSURE  SCHEDULE 4.13.3,
there is no pending investigation or enforcement action by  any Governmental
Entity or Bank Regulator with respect to any GLB Compensation  and Benefit
Plan, or any plan maintained by any entity which is considered  one 
employer with GLB under Section 4001(b)(1) of ERISA or Code Section 414
("ERISA  Affiliate")(such plan being referred to as an "ERISA Affiliate 
Plan"). Neither GLB, its Subsidiaries, nor any ERISA Affiliate  has
contributed to any "multiemployer plan," as defined in Section 3(37) of 
ERISA.

 

 

4.13.4. Except  as set forth in GLB DISCLOSURE SCHEDULE 4.13.4, all material
contributions  required to be made under the terms of any GLB Compensation
and Benefit Plan  or  ERISA Affiliate Plan or any employee benefit
arrangements to which GLB or  any  GLB Subsidiary is a party or a sponsor
have been timely made, and all  contributions and funding obligations are
accrued on GLB's consolidated  financial statements to the extent required by
GAAP. GLB and its  Subsidiaries have expensed and accrued as a liability the
present value of  future benefits under each applicable GLB Compensation and
Benefit Plan for  financial reporting purposes as required by GAAP.

 

 

4.13.5. Except  as set forth in GLB DISCLOSURE SCHEDULE 4.13.5(a), neither
GLB nor any GLB  Subsidiary has any obligations to provide retiree health,
life insurance,  disability insurance, or other retiree death benefits under
any GLB Compensation  and Benefit Plan, other than benefits mandated by COBRA
or other applicable  law. Except as set forth in GLB DISCLOSURE SCHEDULE
4.13.5(b),  there has been no communication to employees by GLB or any GLB
Subsidiary  that  would reasonably be expected to promise or guarantee such
employees retiree  health, life insurance, disability insurance, or other
retiree death  benefits.

 


 

 

 

 

 

 

 

28  

 

 

 

 

 


 

4.13.6. Except  as set forth in GLB DISCLOSURE SCHEDULE 4.13.6, GLB and its
Subsidiaries do  not maintain any GLB Compensation and Benefit Plans covering
employees who  are  not United States residents.

 

 

4.13.7. With  respect to each GLB Compensation and Benefit Plan, if
applicable, GLB has  provided or made available to FNFG copies of: (A) any
trust  instruments and insurance contracts; (B) the three most recent Forms
5500  filed  with the IRS; (C) the three most recent actuarial reports and
financial  statements; (D) the most recent summary plan description; (E) most
recent  Favorable Letter issued by the IRS; (F) any Form 5310 or Form 5330
filed  with  the IRS within the last three years; and (G) the most recent
nondiscrimination  tests performed under ERISA and the Code (including 401(k)
and 401(m)  tests).

 

 

4.13.8. Except  as disclosed in GLB DISCLOSURE SCHEDULE 4.13.8, the
consummation of the Merger  will not, directly or indirectly (including,
without limitation, as a result  of  any termination of employment or
service at any time prior to or following  the  Effective Time) (A) entitle
any employee, consultant or director to any payment  or benefit (including
severance pay, change in control benefit, or similar  compensation) or any
increase in compensation, (B) result in the vesting  or  acceleration of any
benefits under any GLB Compensation and Benefit Plan  or (C)  result in any
material increase in benefits payable under any GLB Compensation  and Benefit
Plan.

otherwise,  which will survive the Effective Time by reason of any agreement
to register  any  transaction involving any of its securities under the
Securities  Act.

 

 

4.22. _Risk  Management Instruments._

 

 

All  material interest rate swaps, caps, floors, option agreements, futures

whether  entered into for GLB's own account, or for the account of one or
more of GLB's  Subsidiaries or their customers (all of which are set forth in
GLB DISCLOSURE  SCHEDULE 4.22), were in all material respects entered into in
compliance  with  all applicable laws, rules, regulations and regulatory
policies, and to the  Knowledge of GLB, with counterparties believed to be
financially responsible  at  the time; and to GLB's Knowledge each of them
constitutes the valid and legally  binding obligation of GLB or one of its
Subsidiaries, enforceable in accordance  with its terms (except as
enforceability may be limited by applicable  bankruptcy, insolvency,
reorganization, moratorium, fraudulent  transfer

that, subject to  the terms, conditions and qualifications set forth therein,
as of the date  hereof, the Merger Consideration to be received by the

from a financial  point  of view. Such opinion has not been amended or
rescinded as of the  date of this Agreement.

 

 

4.24. _Trust  Accounts_

 

 

GBSB  and  each of its subsidiaries has properly administered all accounts
for which  it  acts as a fiduciary, including but not limited to accounts
for which it serves  as trustee, agent, custodian, personal representative,
guardian, conservator  or  investment advisor, in accordance with the terms
of the governing documents  and  applicable laws and regulations. Neither

names, servicemarks  and trademarks used in their business, each without
payment (except as set  forth  in GLB DISCLOSURE SCHEDULE 4.25), and neither

respect thereto that asserts the rights  of  others. GLB and each GLB
Subsidiary have performed all the  obligations required to be performed, and

arrangement or commitment relating to any  of the  foregoing. To the

such  filings and approvals as are required to be made or obtained under
the  securities or "Blue Sky" laws of various states in connection with the
issuance  of the shares of FNFG Common Stock pursuant to this Agreement, and

Approvals or other required consents or approvals will not be received, or 
that  (ii) any public body or authority, the consent or approval of which is
not  required or to which a filing is not required, will object to the
completion  of  the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

 

 

5.6. _Financial  Statements._

 

 

5.6.1. FNFG  has previously made available to GLB the FNFG Financial 
Statements. The FNFG Financial Statements have been prepared in  accordance
with GAAP, and (including the related notes where applicable)  fairly 
present in each case in all material respects (subject in the case of the 
unaudited interim statements to normal year-end adjustments) the
consolidated  financial position, results of operations and cash flows of
FNFG and the  FNFG  Subsidiaries on a consolidated basis as of and for the
respective periods  ending  on the dates thereof, in accordance with GAAP
during the periods involved,  except as indicated in the notes thereto, or in
the case of unaudited  statements, as permitted by Form 10-Q.

 

 

5.6.2. At  the date of each balance sheet included in the FNFG Financial
Statements,  FNFG  did not have any liabilities, obligations or loss
contingencies of any nature  (whether absolute, accrued, contingent or
otherwise) of a type required to  be  reflected in such FNFG Financial
Statements or in the footnotes thereto which  are not fully reflected or
reserved against therein or fully disclosed in  a  footnote thereto, except
for liabilities, obligations and loss contingencies  which are not material
individually or in the aggregate or which are incurred  in  the ordinary
course of business, consistent with past practice, and except  for 
liabilities, obligations and loss contingencies which are within the subject 
matter of a specific representation and warranty herein and subject, in the 
case  of any unaudited statements, to normal, recurring audit adjustments and
the  absence of footnotes.

 

 

5.6.3. The  records, systems, controls, data and information of FNFG and its
Subsidiaries  are recorded, stored, maintained and operated under means
(including any  electronic, mechanical or photographic process, whether
computerized or not)  that are under the

 


 

 

 

 

 

 

 

38  

 

 

 

 

 


 

exclusive  ownership and direct control of FNFG or its Subsidiaries or
accountants  (including all means of access thereto and therefrom), except
for any  non-exclusive ownership and non-direct control that would not
reasonably  be  expected to have a material adverse effect on the system of
internal accounting  controls described below in this Section 5.6.3. FNFG 
(x) has implemented and maintains a system of internal control over 
financial reporting (as required by Rule 13a-15(a) of the Exchange Act) that 
is  designed to provide reasonable assurances regarding the reliability of
financial  reporting and the preparation of its financial statements for
external purposes  in accordance with GAAP, (y) has implemented and maintains
disclosure  controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) of the
Exchange Act)  to  ensure that material information relating to FNFG,
including its consolidated  Subsidiaries, is made known to the chief
executive officer and the chief  financial officer of FNFG by others within
those entities, and (z) has  disclosed, based on its most recent evaluation
prior to the date hereof,  to  FNFG's outside auditors and the audit
committee of FNFG's Board of Directors  (i) any significant deficiencies and
material weaknesses in the design or  operation of internal control over
financial reporting (as defined in Rule  13a-15(f) of the Exchange Act) which
are reasonably likely to adversely affect  FNFG's ability to record, process,
summarize and report financial information  and (ii) any fraud, whether or
not material, that involves management or  other employees who have a
significant role in FNFG's internal control over  financial reporting. As of
the date hereof, to the knowledge of FNFG, its  chief  executive officer and
chief financial officer will be able to give the  certifications required
pursuant to the rules and regulations adopted pursuant  to Section 302 of the
Sarbanes-Oxley Act, without qualification, when next  due.

 

 

5.6.4. The  allowance for credit losses reflected in FNFG's audited statement
of condition  at December 31, 2006 was, and the allowance for credit losses
shown on the  balance sheets in FNFG's Securities Documents for periods
ending after December  31, 2006 was or will be, as the case may be, adequate,
as of the dates thereof,  under GAAP.

 

 

5.7. _Taxes._

 

 

FNFG  and  the FNFG Subsidiaries that are at least 80 percent owned by FNFG
are members  of  the same affiliated group within the meaning of Code
Section  1504(a). FNFG has duly filed all federal, state and material local 
tax returns required to be filed by or with respect to FNFG and each FNFG 
Subsidiary on or prior to the Closing Date, taking into account any
extensions  (all such returns, to the Knowledge of FNFG, being accurate and
correct in  all  material respects) and has duly paid or made provisions for
the payment of  all  material federal, state and local taxes which have been
incurred by or are  due  or claimed to be due from FNFG and any FNFG
Subsidiary by any taxing authority  or pursuant to any written tax sharing
agreement on or prior to the Closing  Date  other than taxes or other
charges which (i) are not delinquent, (ii) are  being  contested in good
faith, or (iii) have not yet been fully  determined. FNFG and each of its
Subsidiaries has withheld and paid  all taxes required to have been withheld
and paid in connection with amounts  paid or owing to any employee,
independent contractor, creditor, shareholder  or  other third party, and
FNFG and each of its Subsidiaries, to the Knowledge  of  FNFG, has timely
complied with all applicable information reporting requirements  under Part
III, Subchapter A of Chapter 61 of the Code and similar applicable  state and
local information reporting requirements. 


 

_5.8._ _No  Material Adverse Effect._

 

 

FNFG  has  not suffered any Material Adverse Effect since December 31, 2006
and no  event has occurred or circumstance arisen since that date which, in
the  aggregate, has had or is reasonably likely to have a Material Adverse
Effect  on  FNFG.

5.9. _Ownership  of Property; Insurance Coverage._

 

 

5.9.1. FNFG  and each FNFG Subsidiary has good and, as to real property,
marketable title  to  all material assets and properties owned by FNFG or
each FNFG Subsidiary  in the  conduct of their businesses, whether such
assets and properties are real  or  personal, tangible or intangible,
including assets and property reflected  in the  balance sheets contained in
the FNFG Financial Statements or acquired subsequent  thereto (except to the
extent that such assets and properties have been disposed  of in the ordinary
course of business, since the date of such balance sheets),  subject to no
material encumbrances, liens, mortgages, security interests  or  pledges,
except (i) those items which secure liabilities for public or statutory 
obligations or any discount with, borrowing from or other obligations to
FHLB,  inter-bank credit facilities, or any transaction by a FNFG Subsidiary
acting  in  a fiduciary capacity, (ii) statutory liens for amounts not yet
delinquent  or  which are being contested in good faith, (iii) non-monetary
liens affecting  real  property which do not adversely affect the value or
use of such real property,  and (iv) those described and reflected in the
FNFG Financial  Statements. FNFG and the FNFG Subsidiaries, as lessee, have
the right  under valid and existing leases of real and personal properties
used by FNFG  and  its Subsidiaries in the conduct of their businesses to
occupy or use all  such  properties as presently occupied and used by each
of them.

 

 

5.10. _Legal  Proceedings._

 

 

Except  as  disclosed in FNFG DISCLOSURE SCHEDULE 5.10, neither FNFG nor any
FNFG  Subsidiary is a party to any, and there are no pending or, to the
Knowledge  of  FNFG, threatened legal, administrative, arbitration or other
proceedings,  claims  (whether asserted or unasserted), actions or
governmental investigations  or  inquiries of any nature (i) against FNFG or
any FNFG Subsidiary,  (ii) to which FNFG or any FNFG Subsidiary's assets are
or may be subject,  (iii) challenging the validity or propriety of any of the
transactions  contemplated by this Agreement, or (iv) which would reasonably
be expected  to  adversely affect the ability of FNFG to perform under this
Agreement, except  for  any proceeding, claim, action, investigation or
inquiry which, if adversely  determined, individually or in the aggregate,
would not be reasonably expected  to have a Material Adverse Effect.

 

 

5.11. _Compliance  With Applicable Law._

 

 

5.11.1. To  the Knowledge of FNFG, each of FNFG and each FNFG Subsidiary is
in compliance  in  all material respects with all applicable federal, state,
local and foreign  statutes, laws, regulations, ordinances, rules, judgments,
orders or decrees  applicable to it, its properties, assets and deposits, its
business, and  its  conduct of business and its relationship with its
employees, including, without  limitation, the USA Patriot Act, the Equal
Credit Opportunity Act, the Fair  Housing Act, the Community Reinvestment Act
of 1977, the Home Mortgage  Disclosure Act, and all other applicable fair
lending laws and other laws  relating to discriminatory  business practices,
and neither FNFG nor any FNFG Subsidiary has received  any  written notice
to the contrary. The Board of Directors of First Niagara Bank  has  adopted
and First Niagara Bank has implemented an anti-money laundering program  that
contains adequate and appropriate customer identification verification 
procedures that has not been deemed ineffective by any Governmental
Authority  and that meets the requirements of Sections 352 and 326 of the USA
Patriot  Act  and the regulations thereunder.

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

40  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

5.11.2. Each  of FNFG and each FNFG Subsidiary has all material permits,
licenses,  authorizations, orders and approvals of, and has made all filings,
applications  and registrations with, all Bank Regulators that are required
in order to  permit  it to own or lease its properties and to conduct its
business as presently  conducted; all such permits, licenses, certificates of
authority, orders  and  approvals are in full force and effect and, to the
Knowledge of FNFG, no  suspension or cancellation of any such permit,
license, certificate, order  or  approval is threatened or will result from
the consummation of the transactions  contemplated by this Agreement, subject
to obtaining the Regulatory  Approvals.

 

 

5.11.3. For  the period beginning January 1, 2003, neither FNFG nor any FNFG
Subsidiary  has received any written notification or, to the Knowledge of
FNFG, any other  communication from any Bank Regulator (i) asserting that
FNFG or any FNFG  Subsidiary is not in material compliance with any of the
statutes, regulations  or ordinances which such Bank Regulator enforces; (ii)
threatening to revoke  any  license, franchise, permit or governmental
authorization which is material  to  FNFG or First Niagara Bank or First
Niagara Commercial Bank; (iii) requiring  or  threatening to require FNFG or
any FNFG Subsidiary, or indicating that FNFG  or  any FNFG Subsidiary may be
required, to enter into a cease and desist order,  agreement or memorandum of
understanding or any other agreement with any  federal  or state
governmental agency or authority which is charged with the supervision  or
regulation of banks or engages in the insurance of bank deposits restricting 
or limiting, or purporting to restrict or limit, in any material respect 
the  operations of FNFG or any FNFG Subsidiary, including without limitation
any  restriction on the payment of dividends; or (iv) directing, restricting
or  limiting, or purporting to direct, restrict or limit, in any manner the 
operations of FNFG or any FNFG Subsidiary, including without limitation any 
restriction on the payment of dividends (any such notice, communication, 
memorandum, agreement or order described in this sentence is hereinafter 
referred to as an "FNFG Regulatory Agreement"). Neither FNFG nor any FNFG 
Subsidiary has consented to or entered into any currently effective FNFG 
Regulatory Agreement. The most recent regulatory rating given to  First
Niagara Bank as to compliance with the CRA is satisfactory or  better.

 

 

5.11.4. Since  the enactment of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, FNFG has been and is
in compliance  in  all material respects with (i) the applicable provisions
of the  Sarbanes-Oxley Act and (ii) the applicable listing and corporate
governance  rules and regulations of the Nasdaq.

 

 

5.12. _Employee  Benefit Plans._

 

 

5.12.1. FNFG  DISCLOSURE SCHEDULE 5.12 includes a list of all existing bonus,
incentive,  deferred compensation, pension, retirement, profit-sharing,
thrift, savings,  employee stock ownership, stock bonus, stock purchase,
restricted stock,  stock  option, stock appreciation, phantom stock,
severance, welfare benefit plans,  fringe benefit plans, employment,
severance  and change in control agreements and all other benefit practices,
policies  and  arrangements maintained by FNFG or any FNFG Subsidiary and in
which employees  in  general may participate (the "FNFG Compensation and
Benefit  Plans").

 

 

5.12.2. To  the Knowledge of FNFG and except as disclosed in FNFG DISCLOSURE
SCHEDULE  5.12.2, each FNFG Compensation and Benefit Plan has been operated
and  administered in all material respects in accordance with its terms and
with 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

41  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

applicable  law, including, but not limited to, ERISA, the Code, the
Securities Act,  the  Exchange Act, the Age Discrimination in Employment
Act, COBRA, the Health  Insurance Portability and Accountability Act and any
regulations or rules  promulgated thereunder, and no notice has been issued
by any Governmental  Entity  questioning or challenging such compliance. All
material filings,  disclosures and notices required by ERISA, the Code, the
Securities Act,  the  Exchange Act, the Age Discrimination in Employment Act
and any other applicable  law have been timely made or any interest, fines,
penalties or other impositions  for late filings have been paid in full. Each
FNFG Compensation and  Benefit Plan which is a Pension Plan _and_ which is
intended to be  qualified under Section 401(a) of the Code has received a
favorable  determination letter from the IRS, and FNFG is not aware of any
circumstances  which are reasonably likely to result in revocation of any
such favorable  determination letter. There is no material pending or, to
the  Knowledge of FNFG, threatened action, suit or claim relating to any of
the  FNFG  Compensation and Benefit Plans (other than routine claims for 
benefits). Neither FNFG nor any FNFG Subsidiary has engaged in a 
transaction, or omitted to take any action, with respect to any FNFG 
Compensation and Benefit Plan that would reasonably be expected to subject 
FNFG  or any FNFG Subsidiary to an unpaid tax or penalty imposed by either
Section  4975 of the Code or Section 502 of ERISA.

 

 

5.12.3. No  liability to any Governmental Entity, other than PBGC premiums
arising in  the  ordinary course of business, has been or is expected by
FNFG or any of its  Subsidiaries to be incurred with respect to any FNFG
Compensation and Benefit  Plan which is a Defined Benefit Plan or with
respect to any ERISA Affiliate  Plan  currently or formerly maintained by
FNFG or any ERISA Affiliate. To  the Knowledge of FNFG, no FNFG Defined
Benefit Plan had an "accumulated funding  deficiency" (as defined in Section
302 of ERISA), whether or not waived,  as of  the last day of the end of the
most recent plan year ending prior to the  date  hereof. No notice of a
"reportable event" (as defined in Section 4043  of ERISA) for which the
30-day reporting requirement has not been waived  has  been required to be
filed for any FNFG Defined Benefit Plan within the 12-month  period ending on
the date hereof. Neither FNFG nor any of its  Subsidiaries has provided, or
is required to provide, security to any FNFG  Defined Benefit Plan or to any
single-employer plan of an ERISA Affiliate  pursuant to Section 401(a)(29) of
the Code or has taken any action, or omitted  to take any action, that has
resulted, or would reasonably be expected to  result  in the imposition of a
lien under Section 412(n) of the Code or pursuant  to  ERISA. Neither FNFG,
its Subsidiaries, nor any ERISA Affiliate has  contributed to any
"multiemployer plan," as defined in Section 3(37) of ERISA,  on or after
January 1, 1998. To the Knowledge of FNFG, there is no  pending investigation
or enforcement action by any Bank Regulator with respect  to any FNFG
Compensation and Benefit Plan or any ERISA Affiliate  Plan.

 

 

5.12.4. All  material contributions required to be made under the terms of
any FNFG  Compensation and Benefit Plan or ERISA Affiliate Plan or any
employee benefit  arrangements  to which FNFG or any FNFG Subsidiary is a
party or a sponsor have been timely  made, and all anticipated contributions
and funding obligations are accrued  on  FNFG's consolidated financial
statements to the extent required by  GAAP. FNFG and its Subsidiaries have
expensed and accrued as a  liability the present value of future benefits
under each applicable FNFG  Compensation and Benefit Plan for financial
reporting purposes as required  by  GAAP.

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

42  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

5.13. _Environmental  Matters._

 

 

5.13.1. To  the Knowledge of FNFG, neither the conduct nor operation of its
business  nor any  condition of any property currently or previously owned
or operated by it  (including, without limitation, in a fiduciary or agency
capacity), or on  which  it holds a lien, results or resulted in a violation
of any Environmental  Laws  that is reasonably likely to impose a material
liability (including a material  remediation obligation) upon FNFG or any of
FNFG Subsidiary. To the  Knowledge of FNFG, no condition has existed or event
has occurred with respect  to any of them or any such property that, with
notice or the passage of time,  or  both, is reasonably likely to result in
any material liability to FNFG or  any  FNFG Subsidiary by reason of any
Environmental Laws. Neither FNFG nor  any FNFG Subsidiary during the past
five years has received any written notice  from any Person that FNFG or any
FNFG Subsidiary or the operation or condition  of any property ever owned,
operated, or held as collateral or in a fiduciary  capacity by any of them
are currently in violation of or otherwise are alleged  to have financial
exposure under any Environmental Laws or relating to Materials  of
Environmental Concern (including, but not limited to, responsibility (or 
potential responsibility) for the cleanup or other remediation of any
Materials  of Environmental Concern at, on, beneath, or originating from any
such property)  for which a material liability is reasonably likely to be
imposed upon FNFG  or  any FNFG Subsidiary.

 

 

5.13.2. There  is no suit, claim, action, demand, executive or administrative
order, directive,  investigation or proceeding pending or, to the FNFG 's
Knowledge, threatened,  before any court, governmental agency or other forum
against FNFG or any  FNFG  Subsidiary (x) for alleged noncompliance
(including by any predecessor) with,  or  liability under, any Environmental
Law or (y) relating to the presence of  or  release (defined herein) into
the environment of any Materials of Environmental  Concern (as defined
herein), whether or not occurring at or on a site owned,  leased or operated
by any of the FNFG .

 

 

5.14. _Loan  Losses._

 

 

The  allowance for loan losses reflected in FNFG's audited consolidated
balance sheet  at December 31, 2006 was, and the allowance for loan losses
shown on the  balance  sheets in FNFG's Securities Documents for periods
ending after December 31, 2006  were adequate, as of the dates thereof, under
GAAP.

 

 

5.15. _Securities  Documents_

 

 

FNFG  has  made available to GLB copies of its (i) annual reports on Form
10-K for the  years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004, (ii) quarterly
reports on Form  10-Q for the quarters ended March 31 and June 30, 2007, and
(iii) proxy  materials used or for use in

 


 
 

connection  with its meetings of shareholders held in 2007, 2006 and 2005.
Such reports  and  such proxy materials complied, at the time filed with the
SEC, in all material  respects, with the Securities Laws.

 

 

5.16. _Brokers,  Finders and Financial Advisors_

 

 

Neither  FNFG nor any FNFG Subsidiary, nor any of their respective officers,
directors,  employees or agents, has employed any broker, finder or financial
advisor  in  connection with the

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

43  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

transactions  contemplated by this Agreement, or incurred any liability or
commitment for  any  fees or commissions to any such person in connection
with the transactions  contemplated by this Agreement except for the
retention of Stifel, Nicolaus  and Company, Incorporated and the fee payable
pursuant thereto.

 

 

5.17. _FNFG  Common Stock_

 

 

The  shares of FNFG Common Stock to be issued pursuant to this Agreement,
when  issued  in accordance with the terms of this Agreement, will be duly
authorized,  validly  issued, fully paid and non-assessable and subject to
no preemptive  rights.

 

 

5.18. _FNFG  Information Supplied_

 

 

The  information relating to FNFG and any FNFG Subsidiary to be contained in
the  Merger Registration Statement, or in any other document filed with any
Bank  Regulator or other Governmental Entity in connection herewith, will not
contain  any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material
fact  necessary to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances
in  which  they are made, not misleading. The Merger Registration Statement
will  comply with the provisions of the Exchange Act and the rules and
regulations  thereunder and the provisions of the Securities Act and the
rules and  regulations thereunder, except that no representation or warranty
is made  by  FNFG with respect to statements made or incorporated by
reference therein  based  on information supplied by GLB specifically for
inclusion or incorporation  by  reference in the Merger Registration
Statement.

Agreement to the Effective  Time and that the Stock Purchase Plan shall be
terminated  no later than the Effective Time, including cancellation of the
reservation  of  200,000 shares for issuance under the Plan.

 



 

6.2. _Current  Information._

 

 

6.2.1. During  the period from the date of this Agreement to the Effective
Time, GLB will  cause  one or more of its representatives to confer with
representatives of FNFG  and  report the general status of its ongoing
operations at such times as FNFG  may  reasonably request. GLB will promptly
notify FNFG of any material  change in the normal course of its business or
in the operation of its  properties and, to the extent permitted by
applicable law, of

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

48  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

any  governmental complaints, investigations or hearings (or communications 
indicating that the same may be contemplated), or the institution or the 
threat  of material litigation involving GLB or any GLB Subsidiary. Without 
limiting the foregoing, senior officers of FNFG and GLB shall meet on a 
reasonably regular basis (expected to be at least monthly) to review the 
financial and operational affairs of GLB and its Subsidiaries, in accordance 
with applicable law, and GLB shall give due consideration to FNFG's input on 
such matters, with the understanding that, notwithstanding any other
provision  contained in this Agreement, neither FNFG nor any FNFG Subsidiary
shall under  any circumstance be permitted to exercise control of GLB or any
GLB Subsidiary  prior to the Effective Time.

 

 

6.2.2. GBSB  and First Niagara Bank shall meet on a regular basis to discuss
and plan  for the  conversion of GBSB's data processing and related
electronic informational  systems to those used by First Niagara Bank, which
planning shall include,  but  not be limited to, discussion of the possible
termination by GBSB of third-party  service provider arrangements effective
at the Effective Time or at a date  thereafter, non-renewal of personal
property leases and software licenses  used  by GBSB in connection with its
systems operations, retention of outside  consultants and additional
employees to assist with the conversion, and  outsourcing, as appropriate, of
proprietary or self-provided system services,  it  being understood that
GBSB shall not be obligated to take any such action  prior  to the Effective
Time and, unless GBSB otherwise agrees, no conversion shall  take place prior
to the Effective Time. In the event that GBSB takes,  at the request of First
Niagara Bank, any action relative to third parties  to  facilitate the
conversion that results in the imposition of any termination  fees  or
charges, First Niagara Bank shall indemnify GBSB for any such fees and 
charges, and the costs of reversing the conversion process, if for any
reason  the Merger is not consummated for any reason other than a breach of
this  Agreement by GLB, or a termination of this Agreement under Section
11.1.8  or  11.1.9.

 

 

6.2.3. GBSB  shall provide First Niagara Bank, within fifteen (15) business
days of the  end  of each calendar month, a written list of nonperforming
assets (the term  "nonperforming assets," for purposes of this subsection,
means (i) loans that  are "troubled debt restructuring" as defined in
Statement of Financial  Accounting Standards No. 15, "Accounting by Debtors
and Creditors for Troubled  Debt Restructuring," (ii) loans on nonaccrual,
(iii) real estate owned, (iv) all  loans ninety (90) days or more past due)
as of the end of such month and  (iv)  and impaired loans. On a monthly
basis, GLB shall provide First  Niagara Bank with a schedule of all loan
approvals, which schedule shall  indicate the loan amount, loan type and
other material features of the  loan.

 

 

6.2.4. GLB  shall promptly inform FNFG upon receiving notice of any legal,
administrative,  arbitration or other proceedings, demands, notices, audits
or investigations  (by  any federal, state or local commission, agency or
board) relating to the  alleged  liability of GLB or any GLB Subsidiary
under any labor or employment  law.

 

 

6.3. _Access  to Properties and Records._

 

 

Subject  to Section 12.1 hereof, GLB shall permit FNFG reasonable access upon
reasonable  notice to its properties and those of the GLB Subsidiaries, and
shall disclose  and make available to FNFG during normal business hours all
of its books,  papers  and records relating to the assets, properties,
operations, obligations and  liabilities, including, but not limited

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

49  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to,  all  books of account (including the general ledger), tax records,
minute books  of  directors' (other than minutes that discuss any of the
transactions contemplated  by this Agreement or any other subject matter GLB
reasonably determines should  be treated as confidential) and shareholders'
meetings, organizational  documents, Bylaws, material contracts and
agreements, filings with any  regulatory authority, litigation files, plans
affecting employees, and any  other  business activities or prospects in
which FNFG may have a reasonable interest;  provided, however, that GLB shall
not be required to take any action that  would  provide access to or to
disclose information where such access or disclosure  would violate or
prejudice the rights or business interests or confidences  of  any customer
or other person or would result in the waiver by it of the  privilege
protecting communications between it and any of its counsel. GLB  shall 
provide and shall request its auditors to provide FNFG with such historical 
financial information regarding it (and related audit reports and consents) 
as  FNFG may reasonably request for securities disclosure purposes. FNFG 
shall use commercially reasonable efforts to minimize any interference with 
GLB's regular business operations during any such access to GLB's property, 
books and records. GLB and each GLB Subsidiary shall permit FNFG, at  its
expense, to cause a "phase I environmental audit" and a "phase II 
environmental audit" to be performed at any physical location owned or
occupied  by GLB or any GLB Subsidiary. In the event any subsurface or phase
II  site assessments are conducted, FNFG shall indemnify GLB and its
Subsidiaries  for all costs and expenses associated with returning the
property to its  previous condition.

 

 

6.4. _Financial  and Other Statements._

 

 

6.4.1. Promptly  upon receipt thereof, GLB will furnish to FNFG copies of
each annual, interim  or  special audit of the books of GLB and the GLB
Subsidiaries made by its  independent auditors and copies of all internal
control reports submitted  to GLB  by such auditors in connection with each
annual, interim or special audit  of the  books of GLB and the GLB
Subsidiaries made by such auditors.

 

 

6.4.2. As  soon as reasonably available, but in no event later than the date
such documents  are filed with the SEC, GLB will deliver to FNFG the
Securities Documents  filed  by it with the SEC under the Securities Laws.
GLB will furnish to  FNFG copies of all documents, statements and reports as
it or any GLB Subsidiary  shall send to its shareholders, the FDIC, the FRB,
the Department or any  other  regulatory authority, except as legally
prohibited thereby. Within 25  days after the end of each month, GLB will
deliver to FNFG a consolidated  balance sheet  and  a consolidated
statement of income, without related notes, for such month  prepared in
accordance with current financial reporting practices.

 

 

6.4.3. GLB  will advise FNFG promptly of the receipt of any examination
report of any  Bank  Regulator with respect to the condition or activities
of GLB or any of the  GLB  Subsidiaries.

 

 

6.4.4. With  reasonable promptness, GLB will furnish to FNFG such additional
financial  data  that GLB possesses and as FNFG may reasonably request,
including without  limitation, detailed monthly financial statements and loan
reports.

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

50  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

6.5. _Maintenance  of Insurance._

 

 

GLB  shall  maintain, and cause each GLB Subsidiary to maintain, insurance
in such amounts  as are reasonable to cover such risks as are customary in
relation to the  character and location of theirs properties and the nature
of their  business

 

 

6.6. _Disclosure  Supplements._

 

 

From  time  to time prior to the Effective Time, GLB will promptly
supplement or amend  the  GLB DISCLOSURE SCHEDULE delivered in connection
herewith with respect to  any  matter hereafter arising which, if existing,
occurring or known at the date  of  this Agreement, would have been required
to be set forth or described in  such  GLB DISCLOSURE SCHEDULE or which is
necessary to correct any information  in such  GLB DISCLOSURE SCHEDULE which
has been rendered materially inaccurate thereby.  No supplement or amendment
to such GLB DISCLOSURE SCHEDULE shall have any  effect  for the purpose of
determining satisfaction of the conditions set forth in  Article IX.

 

 

6.7. _Consents  and Approvals of Third Parties._

 

 

GLB  shall  use all commercially reasonable efforts to obtain as soon as
practicable  all  consents and approvals necessary or desirable for the
consummation of the  transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

 

 

6.8. _All  Reasonable Efforts._

 

 

Subject  to the terms and conditions herein provided, GLB agrees to use all
commercially  reasonable efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all action
and to do, or  cause  to be done, all things necessary, proper or advisable
under applicable laws  and  regulations to consummate and make effective the
transactions contemplated  by  this Agreement.

 

 

6.9. _Failure  to Fulfill Conditions._

 

 

In  the  event that GLB determines that a condition to its obligation to
complete  the  Merger cannot be fulfilled and that it will not waive that
condition, it  will  promptly notify FNFG. 


 

_6.10._ _No  Solicitation._

 

 

(a)  GLB  shall not, and shall cause its Subsidiaries and the respective
officers,  directors, employees, investment bankers, financial advisors,
attorneys,  accountants, consultants, affiliates and other agents
(collectively, the  "Representatives") not to, directly or indirectly, (i)
initiate, solicit,  induce or knowingly encourage, or take any action to
facilitate the making  of,  any inquiry, offer or proposal which
constitutes, or could reasonably be  expected to lead to, an Acquisition
Proposal; (ii) participate in any  discussions or negotiations regarding any
Acquisition Proposal or furnish,  or  otherwise afford access, to any Person
(other than FNFG) any information  or data  with respect to GLB or any of
its Subsidiaries or otherwise relating to an  Acquisition Proposal; (iii)
release any Person from, waive any provisions  of, or fail to enforce any
confidentiality agreement or standstill agreement  to  which GLB is a party;
or (iv) enter into any agreement, agreement in  principle or letter of intent
with respect to any Acquisition Proposal 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

51  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

or  approve or resolve to approve any Acquisition Proposal or any
agreement,  agreement in principle or letter of intent relating to an
Acquisition Proposal.  Any violation of the foregoing restrictions by GLB or
any Representative,  whether or not such Representative is so authorized and
whether or not such  Representative is purporting to act on behalf of GLB or
otherwise, shall  be  deemed to be a breach of this Agreement by GLB. GLB
and its Subsidiaries  shall,  and shall cause each of GLB Representative to,
immediately cease and cause  to be  terminated any and all existing
discussions, negotiations, and communications  with any Persons with respect
to any existing or potential Acquisition  Proposal.

 



 

For  purposes of this Agreement, "Acquisition Proposal" shall mean any
inquiry, offer  or proposal (other than an inquiry, offer or proposal from
FNFG), whether  or not  in writing, contemplating, relating to, or that
could reasonably be expected  to  lead to, an Acquisition Transaction. For
purposes of this Agreement, "Acquisition Transaction" shall mean (A) any
transaction or series of  transactions involving any merger, consolidation,
recapitalization, share  exchange, liquidation, dissolution or similar
transaction involving GLB or  any  of its Subsidiaries; (B) any transaction
pursuant to which any third party  or group acquires or would acquire
(whether through sale, lease or other  disposition), directly or indirectly,
any assets of GLB or any of its  Subsidiaries representing, in the aggregate,
fifteen percent (15%) or more  of the assets of GLB and its Subsidiaries on a
consolidated basis; (C) any  issuance, sale or other disposition of
(including by way of merger,  consolidation, share exchange or any similar
transaction) securities (or  options, rights or warrants to purchase or
securities convertible into, such  securities) representing fifteen percent
(15%) or more of the votes  attached to the outstanding securities of GLB or
any of its Subsidiaries;  (D) any tender offer or exchange offer that, if
consummated, would result  in any third party or group beneficially owning
fifteen percent (15%) or  more of any class of equity securities of GLB or
any of its Subsidiaries;  or  (E) any transaction which is similar in form,
substance or purpose to any  of the foregoing transactions, or any
combination of the foregoing.

 



 

(b)  Notwithstanding Section 6.10(a), GLB may take any of the actions
described  in clause (ii) of Section 6.10(a) if, but only if, (i) GLB has 
received a bona fide unsolicited written Acquisition Proposal that did not 
result from a breach of this Section 6.10; (ii) GLB Board determines  in good
faith, after consultation with and having considered the advice of  its 
outside legal counsel and its independent financial advisor, that (A) such 
Acquisition Proposal constitutes or is reasonably likely to lead to a
Superior  Proposal and (B) the failure to take such actions  would be
inconsistent with its fiduciary duties to GLB's shareholders under 
applicable law; (iii) GLB has provided FNFG with at least three  (3) Business
Days' prior notice of such determination; and (iv) prior  to furnishing or
affording access to any information or data with respect  to GLB  or any of
its Subsidiaries or otherwise relating to an Acquisition Proposal,  GLB 
receives from such Person a confidentiality agreement with terms no less 
favorable to GLB than those contained in the Confidentiality Agreement. GLB 
shall promptly provide to FNFG any non-public information regarding GLB or 
its  Subsidiaries provided to any other Person that was not previously
provided  to  FNFG, such additional information to be provided no later than
the date of  provision of such information to such other party.

 



 

For  purposes of this Agreement, "Superior Proposal" shall mean any bona fide
written  proposal (on its most recently amended or modified terms, if amended
or  modified) made by a

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

52  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

third  party to enter into an Acquisition Transaction on terms that GLB
Board  determines in its good faith judgment, after consultation with and
having  considered the advice of outside legal counsel and a financial
advisor  (i) would, if consummated, result in the acquisition of all, but not
less  than all, of the issued and outstanding shares of GLB Common Stock or
all,  or  substantially all, of the assets of GLB and its Subsidiaries on a
consolidated  basis; (ii) would result in a transaction that (A) involves 
consideration to the holders of the shares of GLB Common Stock that is more 
favorable, from a financial point of view, than the consideration to be paid 
to  GLB's shareholders pursuant to this Agreement, considering, among other
things,  the nature of the consideration being offered and any material
regulatory  approvals or other risks associated with the timing of the
proposed transaction  beyond or in addition to those specifically
contemplated hereby, and which  proposal is not conditioned upon obtaining
additional financing and (B) is,  in light of the other terms of such
proposal, more favorable to GLB's  shareholders than the Merger and the
transactions contemplated by this  Agreement; and (iii) is reasonably likely
to be completed on the terms  proposed, in each case taking into account all
legal, financial, regulatory  and  other aspects of the proposal.

 

 

(c)  GLB  shall promptly (and in any event within twenty-four (24) hours)
notify FNFG  in writing if any proposals or offers are received by, any
information is  requested from, or any negotiations or discussions are sought
to be initiated  or  continued with, GLB or any GLB Representatives, in each
case in connection  with  any Acquisition Proposal, and such notice shall
indicate the name of the  Person  initiating such discussions or
negotiations or making such proposal, offer  or  information request and the
material terms and conditions of any proposals  or  offers (and, in the case
of written materials relating to such proposal,  offer,  information
request, negotiations or discussion, providing copies of such  materials
(including e-mails or other electronic communications) unless  (i) such
materials constitute confidential information of the party making  such offer
or proposal under an effective confidentiality agreement,  (ii) disclosure of
such materials jeopardizes the attorney-client privilege  or (iii) disclosure
of such materials contravenes any law, rule,  regulation, order, judgment or
decree. GLB agrees that it shall keep FNFG  informed, on a current basis, of
the status and terms of any such proposal,  offer, information request,
negotiations or discussions (including any  amendments or modifications to
such proposal, offer or request).

 



 

(d)  Neither the GLB Board nor any committee thereof shall (i) withdraw,
qualify  or modify, or propose to withdraw, qualify or modify, in a manner
adverse  to  FNFG in connection with  the  transactions contemplated by
this Agreement (including the Merger), the GLB  Recommendation (as defined in
Section 8.1), or make any statement, filing  or  release, in connection with
GLB Shareholders Meeting or otherwise, inconsistent  with the GLB
Recommendation (it being understood that taking a neutral position  or no
position with respect to an Acquisition Proposal shall be considered  an 
adverse modification of the GLB Recommendation); (ii) approve or recommend, 
or propose to approve or recommend, any Acquisition Proposal; or  (iii) enter
into (or cause GLB or any of its Subsidiaries to enter into)  any letter of
intent, agreement in principle, acquisition agreement or other  agreement (A)
related to any Acquisition Transaction (other than a  confidentiality
agreement entered into in accordance with the provisions  of  Section
6.10(b)) or (B) requiring GLB to abandon, terminate or fail to  consummate
the Merger or any other transaction contemplated by this  Agreement.

 



 

 

 

 

 

 

 

53  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

(e)  Notwithstanding Section 6.10(d), prior to the date of GLB Shareholders 
Meeting, the GLB Board may approve or recommend to the shareholders of GLB 
a  Superior Proposal and withdraw, qualify or modify GLB Recommendation in 
connection therewith (a "GLB Subsequent Determination") after the fifth (5th)
Business  Day  following FNFG's receipt of a notice (the "Notice of Superior
Proposal") from  GLB advising FNFG that the GLB Board has decided that a bona
fide unsolicited  written Acquisition Proposal that it received (that did not
result from a  breach  of this Section 6.10) constitutes a Superior Proposal
(it being understood  that GLB shall be required to deliver a new Notice of
Superior Proposal in  respect of any revised Superior Proposal from such
third party or its affiliates  that GLB proposes to accept) if, but only if,
(i) the GLB Board has  reasonably determined in good faith, after
consultation with and having  considered the advice of outside legal counsel
and a financial advisor, that  it  is required to take such actions to
comply with its fiduciary duties to GLB's  shareholders under applicable law,
(ii) during the five (5) Business  Day Period after receipt of the Notice of
Superior Proposal by FNFG, GLB  and the  GLB Board shall have cooperated and
negotiated in good faith with FNFG to  make  such adjustments, modifications
or amendments to the terms and conditions  of  this Agreement as would
enable GLB to proceed with the GLB Recommendation  without a GLB Subsequent
Determination; _provided_ , _however_ , that  FNFG shall not have any
obligation to propose any adjustments, modifications  or  amendments to the
terms and conditions of this Agreement and (iii) at the  end of such five (5)
Business Day period, after taking into account any  such adjusted, modified
or amended terms as may have been proposed by FNFG  since  its receipt of
such Notice of Superior Proposal, GLB Board has again in good  faith made the
determination (A) in clause (i) of this  Section 6.10(e) and (B) that such
Acquisition Proposal constitutes a  Superior Proposal. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, the changing, qualifying  or  modifying of the GLB Recommendation
or the making of a GLB Subsequent  Determination by the GLB Board shall not
change the approval of the GLB Board  for purposes of causing any Takeover
Laws to be inapplicable to this Agreement  and the GLB Voting Agreements and
the transactions contemplated hereby and  thereby, including the Merger.

 



 

(f)  Nothing contained in this Section 6.10 shall prohibit GLB or the GLB
Board  from complying with GLB's obligations required under Rules 14d-9 and
14e-2(a)  promulgated under the Exchange Act; _provided_ , _however_ , that
any  such disclosure relating to an Acquisition Proposal shall be deemed a
change  in  GLB Recommendation unless GLB Board reaffirms GLB Recommendation
in such  disclosure.


 

_6.11._ _Reserves  and Merger-Related Costs._

 

 

GLB  agrees to consult with FNFG with respect to its loan, litigation and
real  estate  valuation policies and practices (including loan
classifications and levels  of  reserves). FNFG and GLB shall also consult
with respect to the  character, amount and timing of restructuring charges to
be taken by each  of  them in connection with the transactions contemplated
hereby and shall take  such  charges as FNFG shall reasonably request and
which are not inconsistent with  GAAP, provided that no such actions need be
effected until FNFG shall have  irrevocably certified to GLB that all
conditions set forth in Article IX  to the  obligation of FNFG to consummate
the transactions contemplated hereby (other  than the delivery of
certificates or opinions) have been satisfied or, where  legally permissible,
waived.

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

54  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

6.12. _Board  of Directors and Committee Meetings._

 

 

GLB  and  GBSB shall permit representatives of FNFG (no more than two) to
attend any  meeting of the Board of Directors of GLB and/or GBSB or the
Executive and  Loan  Committees thereof as an observer, provided that
neither GLB nor GBSB shall  be  required to permit the FNFG representative
to remain present during any  confidential discussion of this Agreement and
the transactions contemplated  hereby or any third party proposal to acquire
control of GLB or GBSB or during  any other matter that the respective Board
of Directors has reasonably  determined to be confidential with respect to
FNFG's participation.

**COVENANTS  OF FNFG**

 

 

7.1. _Conduct  of Business._

 

 

During  the period from the date of this Agreement to the Effective Time,
except  with  the written consent of GLB, which consent will not be
unreasonably withheld,  FNFG will, and it will cause each FNFG Subsidiary to
use reasonable efforts  to  preserve intact its business organization and
assets and maintain its rights  and  franchises; and voluntarily take no
action that would: (i) adversely affect  the  ability of the parties to
obtain the Regulatory Approvals or other approvals  of  Governmental
Entities required for the transaction contemplated hereby, or  materially
increase the period of time necessary to obtain such approvals;  (ii) 
adversely affect its ability to perform its covenants and agreements under 
this  Agreement; or (iii) result in the representations and warranties
contained  in  Article V of this Agreement not being true and correct on the
date of this  Agreement or at any future date on or prior to the Closing Date
or in any  of the  conditions set forth in Article IX hereof not being
satisfied.

 

 

7.2. _Current  Information._

 

 

During  the period from the date of this Agreement to the Effective Time,
FNFG will  cause one or more of its representatives to confer with
representatives of  GLB  and report the general status of its financial
condition, operations and  business and matters relating to the completion of
the transactions contemplated  hereby, at such times as GLB may reasonably
request. FNFG will promptly notify  GLB, to the extent permitted by
applicable law, of any governmental complaints,  investigations or hearings
(or communications indicating that the same may  be  contemplated), or the
institution of material litigation involving FNFG and  any  FNFG Subsidiary.
FNFG  shall be reasonably responsive to requests by GLB for access to such
information  and personnel regarding FNFG and its Subsidiaries as may be
reasonably necessary  for GLB to confirm that the representations and
warranties of FNFG contained  herein are true and correct and that the
covenants of FNFG contained herein  have  been performed in all material
respects; provided, however, that FNFG shall  not  be required to take any
action that would provide access to or to disclose  information where such
access or disclosure, in FNFG's reasonable judgment,  would interfere with
the normal conduct of FNFG's business or would violate or  prejudice the
rights or business interests or confidences of any customer  or  other
person or would result in the waiver by it of the privilege protecting 
communications between it and any of its counsel.

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

55  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

7.3. _Financial  and Other Statements._

 

 

FNFG  will  make available to GLB the Securities Documents filed by it with
the SEC under  the Securities Laws. FNFG will furnish to GLB copies of all 
documents, statements and reports as it or FNFG file with the OTS or any 
other  Bank Regulator authority with respect to the Merger. FNFG will 
furnish to GLB copies of all documents, statements and reports as it or any 
FNFG  Subsidiary sends to the shareholders of FNFG. FNFG will advise GLB 
promptly of the receipt of any examination report of any Bank Regulator with 
respect to the condition or activities of FNFG or any FNFG  subsidiary.

 

 

7.4. _Disclosure  Supplements._

 

 

From  time  to time prior to the Effective Time, FNFG will promptly
supplement or amend  the  FNFG DISCLOSURE SCHEDULE delivered in connection
herewith with respect to  any  material matter hereafter arising which, if
existing, occurring or known  at the  date of this Agreement, would have
been required to be set forth or described  in  such FNFG DISCLOSURE
SCHEDULE or which is necessary to correct any information  in such FNFG
DISCLOSURE SCHEDULE which has been rendered inaccurate thereby.  No 
supplement or amendment to such FNFG DISCLOSURE SCHEDULE shall have any
effect  for the purpose of determining satisfaction of the conditions set
forth in  Article IX.

 

 

7.5. _Consents  and Approvals of Third Parties._

 

 

FNFG  shall use all commercially reasonable efforts to obtain as soon as
practicable  all consents and approvals, necessary or desirable for the
consummation of  the  transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

 

 

7.6. _All  Reasonable Efforts._

 

 

Subject  to the terms and conditions herein provided, FNFG agrees to use all
commercially  reasonable efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all action
and to do, or  cause  to be done, all things necessary, proper or advisable
under applicable laws  and  regulations to consummate and make effective the
transactions contemplated  by  this Agreement. 


 

_7.7._ _Failure  to Fulfill Conditions_.

 

 

In  the  event that FNFG determines that a condition to its obligation to
complete  the  Merger cannot be fulfilled and that it will not waive that
condition, it  will  promptly notify GLB.

 

 

7.8. _Employee  Benefits._

 

 

7.8.1. FNFG  will review all GLB Compensation and Benefit Plans to determine
whether to  maintain, terminate or continue such plans. In the event
employee  compensation and/or benefits as currently provided by GLB or any
GLB Subsidiary  are changed or terminated by FNFG, in whole or in part, FNFG
shall provide  Continuing Employees (as defined below) with compensation and
benefits that  are,  in the aggregate, substantially similar to the
compensation and benefits  provided to similarly situated employees of FNFG
or applicable FNFG Subsidiary  (as of the date any such compensation or
benefit is provided). Employees  of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

56  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

GLB  or  any GLB Subsidiary who become participants in an FNFG Compensation
and Benefit  Plan shall, for purposes of determining eligibility for and for
any applicable  vesting periods of such employee benefits only (and not for
benefit accrual  purposes unless specifically set forth herein) be given
credit for meeting  eligibility and vesting requirements in such plans for
service as an employee  of  GLB or GBSB or any predecessor thereto prior to
the Effective Time, provided,  however, that credit for prior service shall
not be given for any purpose  under  the FNFG ESOP, and provided further,
that credit for benefit accrual purposes  will be given only for purposes of
FNFG vacation policies or programs and  for  purposes of the calculation of
severance benefits under any severance  compensation plan of FNFG. This
Agreement shall not be construed to  limit the ability of FNFG or First
Niagara Bank to terminate the employment  of  any employee or to review
employee benefits programs from time to time and  to  make such changes
(including terminating any program) as they deem  appropriate.

 

 

7.8.2. The  payments and benefits that would be required to be made under the
employment  agreements between (i) GLB and/or GBSB and (ii) each of the
following  individuals, Andrew W. Dorn, Jr. ("Dorn"), Michael J. Rogers
("Rogers") and  Peter B. Babiarz ("Babiarz"), assuming a termination of
employment as of March  31, 2008, shall be calculated in accordance with the
principles set forth  in GLB  DISCLOSURE SCHEDULE 7.8.2, which includes
explanatory detail and analysis  as to  the method of the calculation of the
payments and benefits due. Each  of the executives referenced in this Section
7.8.2 shall sign an acknowledgement  in connection with the execution of this
Agreement, which shall be included  in  GLB DISCLOSURE SCHEDULE 7.8.2,
agreeing to the application of the principles  set  forth therein, and upon
payment thereunder, shall execute a mutually acceptable  release.

 

 

7.8.3.   Any employee of GLB or any GLB Subsidiary who is not a party to an
employment,  change in control or severance agreement or contract providing
severance  payments shall, at the Effective Time, be covered by and eligible
to receive  severance benefits under the severance plan or policy of FNFG
applicable  to its  employees generally, in accordance with the terms of
such plan or  policy.

 

 

7.8.4. In  the event of any termination or consolidation of any GLB health
plan with  any  FNFG health plan, FNFG shall make available to employees of
GLB or any GLB  Subsidiary who continue employment with FNFG or a FNFG
Subsidiary ("Continuing Employees")  and their dependents employer-provided
health coverage on the same basis  as it  provides such coverage to FNFG
employees. Unless a Continuing  Employee affirmatively terminates coverage
under a GLB health plan prior  to the  time that such Continuing Employee
becomes eligible to participate in the  FNFG  health plan, no coverage of
any of the Continuing Employees or their dependents  shall terminate under
any of the GLB health plans prior to the time such  Continuing Employees and
their dependents become eligible to participate  in the  health plans,
programs and benefits common to all employees of FNFG and their  dependents.
In the event of a termination or consolidation of any GLB  health plan,
terminated GLB employees and qualified beneficiaries will have  the  right
to continued coverage under group health plans of FNFG in accordance  with 
COBRA, consistent with the provisions below. In the event of any  termination
of any GLB health plan, or consolidation of any GLB health plan  with  any
FNFG health plan, any coverage limitation under the FNFG health plan  due
to  any pre-existing condition shall be waived by the FNFG health plan to
the  degree  that such condition was covered by the GLB health plan and such
condition  would  otherwise have been covered by the FNFG

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

57  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

health  plan in the absence of such coverage limitation. All GLB Employees 
who cease participating in an GLB health plan and become participants in  a 
comparable FNFG health plan shall receive credit for any co-payment and 
deductibles paid under GLB's health plan for purposes of satisfying any 
applicable deductible or out-of-pocket requirements under the FNFG health 
plan,  upon substantiation, in a form satisfactory to FNFG that such co-
payment  and/or  deductible has been satisfied.

 

 

7.9. _Directors  and Officers Indemnification and Insurance._

 

 

7.9.1.   For a period of six years after the Effective Time, FNFG shall
indemnify,  defend  and hold harmless each person who is now, or who has
been at any time before  the  date hereof or who becomes before the
Effective Time, an officer, director  or  employee of GLB or a GLB
Subsidiary (the "Indemnified Parties") against all  losses, claims, damages,
costs, expenses (including attorney's fees),  liabilities or judgments or
amounts that are paid in settlement (which  settlement shall require the
prior written consent of FNFG, which consent  shall  not be unreasonably
withheld) of or in connection with any claim, action,  suit,  proceeding or
investigation, whether civil, criminal, or administrative (each  a "Claim"),
in which an Indemnified Party is, or is threatened to be made, a party  or
witness in whole or in part on or arising in whole or in part out of the 
fact  that such person is or was a director, officer or employee of GLB or a
GLB  Subsidiary if such Claim pertains to any matter of fact arising,
existing  or  occurring at or before the Effective Time (including, without
limitation,  the  Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby),
regardless of whether  such Claim is asserted or claimed before, or after,
the Effective Time, to  the  fullest extent permitted under applicable state
or Federal law, FNFG's  Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws, and under
GLB's Certificate of  Incorporation or Charter and Bylaws. FNFG shall pay
expenses in advance of  the  final disposition of any such action or
proceeding to each Indemnified Party  to  the full extent permitted by
applicable state or Federal law upon receipt  of an  undertaking to repay
such advance payments if he shall be adjudicated or  determined to be not
entitled to indemnification in the manner set forth  below. Any Indemnified
Party wishing to claim indemnification under  this Section 7.9.1 upon
learning of any Claim, shall notify FNFG (but the  failure so to notify FNFG
shall not relieve it from any liability which it  may  have under this
Section 7.9.1, except to the extent such failure materially  prejudices FNFG)
and shall deliver to FNFG the undertaking referred to in  the  previous
sentence.

 

 

7.9.2. In  the event that either FNFG or any of its successors or assigns 
(i) consolidates with or merges into any other person and shall not be the 
continuing or surviving bank or entity of such consolidation or merger or 
(ii)  transfers all or substantially all of its properties and assets to any
person,  then, and in each such case, proper provision shall be made so that
the  successors and assigns of FNFG shall assume the obligations set forth
in  this  Section 7.9.

 

 

7.9.3. FNFG  shall maintain, or shall cause First Niagara Bank to maintain,
in effect  for six  years following the Effective Time, the current
directors' and officers' liability insurance policies covering the officers
and directors of GLB  (provided, that FNFG may substitute therefor policies
of at least the same  coverage containing terms and conditions which are not
materially less  favorable) with respect to matters occurring at or prior to
the Effective  Time;  provided, however, that in no event shall FNFG be
required to expend pursuant  to  this

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

58  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Section  7.9.3 more than 175% of the annual cost currently expended by GLB
with respect  to such insurance (the "Maximum Amount"); _provided, further,_
that if  the amount of the annual premium necessary to maintain or procure
such insurance  coverage exceeds the Maximum Amount, FNFG shall maintain the
most advantageous  policies of directors' and officers' insurance obtainable
for a premium equal to  the Maximum Amount. In connection with the foregoing,
GLB agrees in order  for  FNFG to fulfill its agreement to provide directors
and officers liability  insurance policies for six years to provide such
insurer or substitute insurer  with such reasonable and customary
representations as such insurer may request  with respect to the reporting of
any prior claims.

 

 

7.9.4. The  obligations of FNFG provided under this Section 7.9 are intended
to be  enforceable against FNFG directly by the Indemnified Parties and shall
be  binding on all respective successors and permitted assigns of FNFG.

 

 

7.10. _Stock  Listing._

 

 

FNFG  agrees to list on the Nasdaq (or such other national securities
exchange  on  which the shares of the FNFG Common Stock shall be listed as
of the date  of  consummation of the Merger), subject to official notice of
issuance, the  shares  of FNFG Common Stock to be issued in the Merger.

 

 

7.11. _Stock  and Cash Reserve._

 

 

FNFG  agrees at all times from the date of this Agreement until the Merger 
Consideration has been paid in full to reserve a sufficient number of shares 
of  its common stock and to maintain sufficient liquid accounts or
borrowing  capacity to fulfill its obligations under this Agreement.

 


 

**ARTICLE  VIII**

 

**REGULATORY  AND OTHER MATTERS**

 

 

8.1. _GLB  Shareholder Meeting._

 

 

GLB  will (i) as promptly as practicable  after the Merger Registration
Statement is declared effective by the SEC,  take  all steps necessary to
duly call, give notice of, convene and hold a meeting  of  its shareholders
(the "GLB Shareholders Meeting"), for the purpose of  considering this
Agreement and the Merger, and for such other purposes as  may  be, in GLB's
reasonable judgment, necessary or desirable, (ii) subject to  Section 6.10,
have its Board of Directors recommend approval of this Agreement  to the GLB
shareholders (the "GLB Recommendation").

 

 

8.2. _Proxy  Statement-Prospectus._

 

 

8.2.1. For  the purposes (x) of registering FNFG Common Stock to be offered
to holders  of  GLB Common Stock in connection with the Merger with the SEC
under the Securities  Act and (y) of holding the GLB Shareholders Meeting,
FNFG shall draft and  prepare, and GLB shall cooperate in the preparation of,
the Merger Registration  Statement, including a combined

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

59  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

proxy  statement and prospectus satisfying all applicable requirements of
applicable  state securities and banking laws, and of the Securities Act and
the Exchange  Act, and the rules and regulations thereunder (such proxy
statement/prospectus  in the form mailed to the GLB shareholders, together
with any and all amendments  or supplements thereto, being herein referred to
as the "Proxy  Statement-Prospectus"). FNFG shall file the Merger
Registration  Statement, including the Proxy Statement-Prospectus, with the 
SEC. Each of FNFG and GLB shall use their reasonable best efforts to  have
the Merger Registration Statement declared effective under the Securities 
Act as promptly as practicable after such filing, and each of GLB and FNFG 
shall  thereafter promptly mail the Proxy Statement-Prospectus to the GLB
shareholders.  FNFG shall also use its reasonably best efforts to obtain all
necessary state  securities law or "Blue Sky" permits and approvals required
to carry out the  transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and GLB shall
furnish all  information concerning GLB and the holders of GLB Common Stock
as may be  reasonably requested in connection with any such action.

 

 

8.2.2. GLB  shall provide FNFG with any information concerning itself that
FNFG may  reasonably request in connection with the drafting and preparation
of the  Proxy  Statement-Prospectus, and FNFG shall notify GLB promptly of
the receipt of  any  comments of the SEC with respect to the Proxy
Statement-Prospectus and of  any  requests by the SEC for any amendment or
supplement thereto or for additional  information and shall provide to GLB
promptly copies of all correspondence  between FNFG or any of their
representatives and the SEC. FNFG shall give  GLB  and its counsel the
opportunity to review and comment on the Proxy  Statement-Prospectus prior to
its being filed with the SEC and shall give  GLB  and its counsel the
opportunity to review and comment on all amendments and  supplements to the
Proxy Statement-Prospectus and all responses to requests  for  additional
information and replies to comments prior to their being filed  with,  or
sent to, the SEC. Each of FNFG and GLB agrees to use all  reasonable efforts,
after consultation with the other party hereto, to respond  promptly to all
such comments of and requests by the SEC and to cause the  Proxy  Statement-
Prospectus and all required  amendments and supplements thereto to be mailed
to the holders of GLB Common  Stock entitled to vote at the GLB Shareholders
Meeting hereof at the earliest  practicable time.

 

 

8.2.3. GLB  and FNFG shall promptly notify the other party if at any time it
becomes  aware  that the Proxy Statement-Prospectus or the Merger
Registration Statement  contains any untrue statement of a material fact or
omits to state a material  fact required to be stated therein or necessary to
make the statements contained  therein, in light of the circumstances under
which they were made, not  misleading. In such event, GLB shall cooperate
with FNFG in the  preparation of a supplement or amendment to such Proxy
Statement-Prospectus  that  corrects such misstatement or omission, and FNFG
shall file an amended Merger  Registration Statement with the SEC, and each
of GLB shall mail an amended  Proxy  Statement-Prospectus to the GLB
shareholders. If requested by FNFG, GLB shall  obtain a "comfort" letter from
its independent certified public accountant,  dated as of the date of the
Proxy Statement-Prospectus and updated as of  the  date of consummation of
the Merger, with respect to certain financial  information regarding GLB, in
form and substance that is customary in  transactions such as the Merger.

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

60  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

8.3. _Regulatory  Approvals._

 

 

Each  of  GLB and FNFG will cooperate with the other and use all reasonable
efforts  to  promptly prepare all necessary documentation, to effect all
necessary filings  and to obtain all necessary permits, consents, waivers,
approvals and  authorizations of the SEC, the Bank Regulators and any other
third parties  and  governmental bodies necessary to consummate the
transactions contemplated  by  this Agreement. GLB and FNFG will furnish
each other and each other's counsel  with all information concerning
themselves, their subsidiaries, directors,  officers and shareholders and
such other matters as may be necessary or  advisable in connection with the
Proxy Statement-Prospectus and any application,  petition or any other
statement or application made by or on behalf of GLB,  FNFG  to any Bank
Regulatory or governmental body in connection with the Merger,  and  the
other transactions contemplated by this Agreement. GLB shall have the 
right  to review and approve in advance all characterizations of the
information  relating to GLB and any of its Subsidiaries, which appear in any
filing made  in  connection with the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement with any  governmental body. FNFG shall give GLB and its counsel
the  opportunity to review and comment on each filing prior to its being
filed  with a  Bank Regulator and shall give GLB and its counsel the
opportunity to review  and  comment on all amendments and supplements to
such filings and all responses  to  requests for additional information and
replies to comments prior to their  being  filed with, or sent to, a Bank
Regulator.

 

 

8.4. _Affiliates._

 

 

8.4.1. GLB  shall use all reasonable efforts to cause each director,
executive officer  and  other person who is an "affiliate" (for purposes of
Rule 145 under the  Securities Act) of GLB to deliver to FNFG, as soon as
practicable after the  date  of this Agreement, and at least thirty (30)
days prior to the date of the  GLB  Shareholders Meeting, a written
agreement, in the form of Exhibit C hereto,  providing that such person will
not sell, pledge, transfer or otherwise dispose  of any shares of FNFG Common
Stock to be received by such "affiliate," as a  result of the  Merger
otherwise than in compliance with the applicable provisions of the 
Securities Act and the rules and regulations thereunder.

consents shall have expired;  and  no such approval, authorization or
consent shall include any condition or  requirement, excluding standard

**TERMINATION,  AMENDMENT AND WAIVER**

 

 

11.1. _Termination._

 

 

This  Agreement may be terminated at any time prior to the Closing Date,
whether  before or after approval of the Merger by the shareholders of GLB:

 

 

11.1.1. At  any time by the mutual written agreement of FNFG and GLB;

 

 

11.1.2. By  the Board of Directors of either party (provided, that the
terminating party  is  not then in material breach of any representation,
warranty, covenant or  other  agreement

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

64  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

contained  herein) if there shall have been a material breach of any of the
representations  or warranties set forth in this Agreement on the part of the
other party,  which  breach by its nature cannot be cured prior to the
Termination Date or shall  not  have been cured within 30 days after written
notice of such breach by the  terminating party to the other party provided,
however, that neither party  shall  have the right to terminate this
Agreement pursuant to this Section 11.1.2  unless the breach of
representation or warranty, together with all other  such  breaches, would
entitle the terminating party not to consummate the transactions 
contemplated hereby under Section 9.2.1 (in the case of a breach of a 
representation or warranty by GLB) or Section 9.3.1 (in the case of a breach 
of  a representation or warranty by FNFG);

 

 

11.1.3. By  the Board of Directors of either party (provided, that the
terminating party  is  not then in material breach of any representation,
warranty, covenant or  other  agreement contained herein) if there shall

or agreements set forth in this  Agreement on the part of the other party,
which failure by its nature cannot  be  cured prior to the Termination Date
or shall not have been cured within 30  days  after written notice of such
failure by the terminating party to the other  party  provided, however,
that neither party shall have the right to terminate this  Agreement pursuant
to this Section 11.1.3 unless the breach of covenant or  agreement, together
with all other such breaches, would entitle the terminating  party not to
consummate the transactions contemplated hereby under Section  9.2.2  (in
the case of a breach of covenant by GLB) or Section 9.3.2 (in the case  of
a  breach of covenant by FNFG);

 

 

11.1.4. At  the election of the Board of Directors of either party if the
Closing shall  not  have occurred by the Termination Date, or such later
date as shall have been  agreed to in writing by FNFG and GLB; provided, that
no party may terminate  this  Agreement pursuant to this Section 11.1.4 if
the failure of the Closing to  have  occurred on or before said date was due
to such party's material breach of any  representation, warranty, covenant or
other agreement contained in this  Agreement;

 

 

11.1.5. By  the Board of Directors of either party if the shareholders of GLB
shall have  voted at the GLB Shareholders Meeting on the transactions
contemplated by  this  Agreement and such vote shall not have been
sufficient to approve such  transactions;

been taken  by a  Bank Regulator whose approval is required in connection
with this Agreement  and  the transactions contemplated hereby, which final
action (x) has become  unappealable and (y) does not approve this Agreement
or the transactions  contemplated hereby, or (ii) any court of competent
jurisdiction or other  governmental authority shall have issued an order,

otherwise prohibiting the Merger and  such  order, decree, ruling or other
action shall have become final and  nonappealable;

 

 

11.1.7. By  the Board of Directors of either party (provided, that the

any of the conditions precedent  to  the obligations of such party to
consummate the Merger cannot be satisfied  or  fulfilled by the date
specified in Section 11.1.4 of this  Agreement.

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

65  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

11.1.8. By  the Board of Directors of FNFG if GLB has received a Superior
Proposal, and  in  accordance with Section 6.10 of this Agreement, the Board
of Directors of  GLB  has entered into an acquisition agreement with respect
to the Superior Proposal,  terminated this Agreement, or withdraws its
recommendation of this Agreement,  fails to make such recommendation or
modifies or qualifies its recommendation  in  a manner adverse to FNFG.

 

 

11.1.9. By  the Board of Directors of GLB if GLB has received a Superior
Proposal, and  in  accordance with Section 6.10 of this Agreement, the Board
of Directors of  GLB  has made a determination to accept such Superior
Proposal.

 

 

11.1.10. By  GLB, if its Board of Directors so determines by a majority vote
of the members  of its entire Board, at any time during the five-day period
commencing on  the  Determination Date, such termination to be effective on
the 30th day following  such  Determination Date ("Effective Termination
Date"), if both of the following  conditions are satisfied:

 

 

(i) The  FNFG Market Value on the Determination Date is less than $11.30; 
and

 

 

(ii) the  number obtained by dividing the FNFG Market Value on the
Determination Date  by  the Initial FNFG Market Value ("FNFG Ratio") shall
be less than the quotient  obtained by dividing the Final Index Price by the
Initial Index Price minus  0.20;

 

 

subject,  however, to the following three sentences. If GLB elects to
exercise  its termination right pursuant to this Section 11.1.10, it shall
give prompt  written notice thereof to FNFG. During the five business day
period  commencing with its receipt of such notice, FNFG shall have the
option of  paying  additional Merger Consideration in the form of FNFG
Common Stock, cash, or  a  combination of FNFG Common Stock and cash so that
the Aggregate FNFG Share  Amount shall be valued at the lesser of (i) the
product of 0.80 and the Initial  FNFG Market Value or (ii) the product
obtained by multiplying the Index Ratio  by  the Initial FNFG Market Value.
If within such five business day  period, FNFG delivers written notice to GLB
that it intends to proceed with  the  Merger by paying such additional
consideration, as contemplated by the preceding  sentence,  then no
termination shall have occurred pursuant to this Section 11.10 and  this
Agreement shall remain in full force and effect in accordance with its  terms
(except that the Merger Consideration shall have been so  modified).

 

 

For  purposes of this Section 11.1.10, the following terms shall have the
meanings  indicated below:

 

 

"Determination  Date" shall mean the first date on which all Regulatory
Approvals (and waivers,  if applicable) necessary for consummation of the

Index, as  reported by SNL Securities, for the five consecutive trading days
immediately  preceding the Determination Date.

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

66

12.1, 12.2, 12.6, 12.9,  12.10,  and any other Section which, by its terms,

(A) Except  as provided below, whether or not the Merger is consummated, all
costs and  expenses incurred in connection with this Agreement and the
transactions  contemplated by this Agreement shall be paid by the party
incurring such  expenses.

 

 

(B) In  the event of a termination of this Agreement because of a willful
breach  of any  representation, warranty, covenant or agreement contained in

damages, costs and expenses, including  all reasonable attorneys' fees,
sustained or incurred by the non-breaching party  as a result thereof or in
connection therewith or with respect to the  enforcement of its rights
hereunder.

 

 

(C) As  a condition of FNFG's willingness, and in order to induce FNFG, to
enter into  this Agreement, and to reimburse FNFG for incurring the costs and
expenses  related to entering into this Agreement and consummating the

rights or claims  against GLB, its Subsidiaries, and their respective
officers and directors,  under this Agreement, it being agreed that the
acceptance of the FNFG Fee  under  Section 11.2.2(C) will constitute the
sole and exclusive remedy of FNFG against  GLB and its Subsidiaries and their
respective officers and  directors.

 

 

11.3. _Amendment,  Extension and Waiver._

 

 

Subject  to applicable law, at any time prior to the Effective Time (whether

hereto by  action  of their respective Boards of Directors, may (a) amend
this Agreement, (b)  extend the time for the performance of any of the
obligations or other acts  of  any other party hereto, (c) waive any
inaccuracies in the representations  and  warranties contained herein or in
any document delivered pursuant hereto,  or (d)  waive compliance with any
of the agreements or conditions contained herein;  provided, however, that
after any approval of this Agreement and the  transactions contemplated
hereby by the shareholders of GLB, there may not  be,  without further
approval of such shareholders, any amendment of this Agreement  which reduces
the amount, value or changes the form of consideration to be  delivered to
GLB's shareholders pursuant to this Agreement. This Agreement may  not be
amended except by an instrument in writing signed on behalf of each  of  the
parties hereto. Any agreement on the part of a party hereto to any extension 
or waiver shall be valid only if set forth in an instrument in writing
signed  on  behalf of such party, but such waiver or failure to insist on
strict compliance  with such obligation, covenant, agreement or condition
shall not operate  as a  waiver of, or estoppel with respect to, any
subsequent or other  failure.

table  of contents, index and headings contained in this Agreement are for
reference  purposes only and shall not affect in any way the meaning or
interpretation  of  this Agreement. Whenever the words "include", "includes"

Agreement", "the date  hereof" and terms of similar import, unless the
context otherwise requires,  shall be deemed to refer to the date set forth
in the Recitals to this  Agreement. The parties have participated jointly in
the negotiation  and drafting of this Agreement. In the event an ambiguity or

accordingly agreed  that the parties shall be entitled to an injunction  or
injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce
specifically  the terms and provisions thereof in any court of the United
States or any  state  having jurisdiction, this being in addition to any
other remedy to which  they  are entitled at law or in equity.
