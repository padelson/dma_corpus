 (a) Prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall appoint an exchange agent reasonably satisfactory to the Company (the " _Exchange Agent_ ") for the purpose of exchanging Certificates for the Merger Consideration and for paying the Equity Award Amount. As soon as reasonably practicable after the Effective Time, Parent will cause the Exchange Agent to send to each holder of record of shares of Company Common Stock as of the Effective Time whose shares of Company Common Stock were converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration pursuant to _Section 2.6_ a letter of transmittal (which shall specify that the delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title shall pass, only upon proper delivery of the Certificates to the Exchange Agent), including instructions for use in effecting the surrender of Certificates to the Exchange Agent in exchange for the Merger Consideration. Immediately after the Effective Time, Parent shall cause to be deposited with the Exchange Agent cash in U.S. dollars sufficient to pay the aggregate Merger Consideration and the Equity Award Amount, in each case in trust for each holder of shares of Company Common Stock and each holder of a Company Stock-Based Award as required to be paid pursuant to this Agreement. All cash deposited with the Exchange Agent shall be referred to in this Agreement as the " _Exchange Fund_ ". The Exchange Agent shall, pursuant to irrevocable instructions, deliver the Merger Consideration and Equity Award Amount contemplated to be paid pursuant to _Section 2.6_ and _Section 2.7_ out of the Exchange Fund. The Exchange Fund shall not be used for any other purpose. The Exchange Agent shall invest the cash included in the Exchange Fund as directed by Parent. Any interest and other income resulting from such investments shall be the property of, and paid to, Parent. 

   

 (b) Each holder of shares of Company Common Stock that have been converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration, upon surrender to the Exchange Agent of a Certificate, together with a properly completed letter of transmittal, duly executed and completed in accordance with the instructions thereto, and such other documents as may reasonably be required by Parent or the Exchange Agent, will be entitled to receive the Merger Consideration in exchange therefor. The Merger Consideration shall be paid as promptly as practicable after receipt by the Exchange Agent of the Certificate and letter of transmittal in accordance with the foregoing. The Equity Award Amount shall be paid, in accordance with instructions from the Company, as promptly as practicable following the Effective Time. No interest shall be paid or accrued on any Merger Consideration. Until so surrendered, each such Certificate shall, after the Effective Time, represent for all purposes only the right to receive such Merger Consideration. 

   

 (c) If any portion of the Merger Consideration is to be paid to a Person other than the Person in whose name the applicable surrendered Certificate is registered, it shall be a condition thereof that the surrendered Certificate shall be properly endorsed or otherwise be in proper form for transfer and that the Person requesting such delivery of the Merger Consideration shall pay to the Exchange Agent any required transfer or other similar Taxes or 

   ##### 

  

    

establish to the satisfaction of the Exchange Agent that such Tax has been
paid or is not payable. 

   

 (d) After the Effective Time, there shall be no further registration of transfers of shares of Company Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time. From and after the Effective Time, the holders of Certificates representing shares of Company Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall cease to have any rights with respect to such shares of Company Common Stock except as otherwise provided in this Agreement or by applicable Law. If, after the Effective Time, Certificates are presented to the Exchange Agent or Parent, they shall be cancelled and exchanged for the consideration provided for, and in accordance with the procedures set forth, in this _ARTICLE II_. 

   

 (e) Any portion of the Exchange Fund that remains unclaimed by the holders of shares of Company Common Stock one (1) year after the Effective Time shall be returned to Parent, upon demand, and any such holder who has not exchanged his or her shares of Company Common Stock for the Merger Consideration in accordance with this _Section 2.9_ prior to that time shall thereafter look only to Parent for delivery of the Merger Consideration in respect of such holders shares of Company Common Stock. Notwithstanding the foregoing, none of Parent, Merger Sub or the Company shall be liable to any holder of shares of Company Common Stock for any Merger Consideration delivered to a public official pursuant to applicable abandoned property Laws. Any Merger Consideration remaining unclaimed by holders of shares of Company Common Stock immediately prior to such time as such amounts would otherwise escheat to or become property of any Governmental Entity shall, to the extent permitted by applicable Law, become the property of Parent free and clear of any claims or interest of any Person previously entitled thereto. 

  

 Section 2.10 _Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates_. If any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the Person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if required by Parent, the posting by such Person of a bond, in such reasonable amount as Parent may direct, as indemnity against any claim that may be made against it with respect to such Certificate, the Exchange Agent will issue in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate the Merger Consideration to be paid in respect of the shares of Company Common Stock represented by such Certificate as contemplated by this _ARTICLE II_. 

  

 Section 2.11 _Withholding Rights_. Each of Parent, Merger Sub and the Surviving Corporation shall be entitled to deduct and withhold, or cause the Exchange Agent to deduct and withhold, from the consideration otherwise payable to any Person pursuant to this Agreement (including pursuant to _Section 2.7_) such amounts as it is required to deduct and withhold with respect to the making of such payment under the Code or any provision of state, local or foreign Tax law. To the extent that amounts are so deducted or withheld and paid over to the applicable Governmental Entity or Taxing Authority, such deducted or withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the holder of shares of Company Common Stock or any Company Stock-Based Award in respect of which such deduction and withholding was made. 

   ##### 

  

  

 Section 2.12 _Further Assurances_. After the Effective Time, the officers and directors of the Surviving Corporation will be authorized to execute and deliver, in the name and on behalf of the Company, any deeds, bills of sale, assignments or assurances and to take and do, in the name and on behalf of the Company, any other actions and things to vest, perfect or confirm of record or otherwise in the Surviving Corporation any and all right, title and interest in, to and under any of the rights, properties or assets acquired or to be acquired by the Surviving Corporation as a result of, or in connection with, the Merger.

Each of the Company Benefit Plans has been operated and administered in all material respects in 

   ##### 

  

    

accordance with its terms and all applicable Laws, including ERISA and the
Code, and the terms of any applicable collectively bargained agreements.
There are no pending or, to the knowledge of the Company, threatened actions,
suits, audits, proceedings or claims by or on behalf of any of the

With respect to each of the Company Benefit Plans that is subject to Title IV

obligations. No event has occurred and, to the knowledge of the Company, no
condition exists that would subject the Company or any Company Subsidiary,

the Code or other applicable Law. Each Company Benefit Plan that constitutes
in any part a nonqualified deferred compensation plan within the meaning of

 (d) None of the negotiation or the execution of this Agreement, the obtaining of the Company Stockholder Approval or the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (alone or in conjunction with any other event, including any termination of employment on or following the Effective Time) will (i) entitle any current or former director, officer, employee or independent contractor of the Company or any Company Subsidiary to any compensation or benefit, (ii) accelerate the time of payment or vesting, or trigger any payment or funding, of any compensation or benefits, or trigger any other obligation, under any Company Benefit Plan, (iii) result in any breach or violation of, default under or limit the Companys right to amend, modify or terminate any Company Benefit Plan or (iv) result in the payment of any amount that would not be deductible as a result of Section 280G of the Code.

   ##### 

  

    

Company Subsidiary residing outside of the U.S. (a " _Foreign Company Benefit
Plan_ "), and except as, individually or in the aggregate, has not resulted
in and would not reasonably be expected to result in any material liability
to the Company or any Company Subsidiary: (i) all employer and employee
contributions to each Foreign Company Benefit Plan required by Law or by the
terms of such Foreign Company Benefit Plan have been made, or, if applicable,
accrued, in accordance with normal accounting practices, (ii) the fair market
value of the assets of each funded Foreign Company Benefit Plan, the
liability of each insurer for any Foreign Company Benefit Plan funded through
insurance or the book reserve established for any Foreign Company Benefit
Plan, together with any accrued contributions, are sufficient to procure or
provide for the accrued benefit obligations with respect to all current and

Without limiting the foregoing, Parent and the Company shall, as promptly as practicable, but in no event later than ten (10) Business Days after the date of this Agreement, file with the United States Federal Trade Commission (the " _FTC_ ") and the United States Department of Justice (the " _DOJ_ ") the notification and report form, if any, required under the HSR Act for the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

Each of the Company and Parent shall furnish to the other such necessary information and reasonable assistance as the other may request in connection with its preparation of any filing or submission which is necessary under the HSR Act, any Foreign Competition Law or the Exon-Florio Amendment. Each of the Company and Parent shall keep each other apprised of the status of any communications with, and any inquiries or requests for additional information from, the FTC, the DOJ and any other Governmental Entity and shall comply with any such inquiry or request as promptly as practicable, but in no event later than five (5) Business Days after receipt of such inquiry or request, or as otherwise agreed to by the Parties, which agreement shall not be unreasonably withheld. Any such additional information shall be in substantial compliance with the applicable requirements of the HSR Act, Foreign Competition Law or the Exon-Florio Amendment. Each of the Company and Parent shall not independently participate in any meeting, or engage in any substantive conversation, with any Governmental Entity in respect of any filing, investigation or inquiry concerning this Agreement, the Merger or the transactions contemplated hereby (including the expected or proposed timing of consummation of the Merger or the other transactions contemplated hereby) without giving the other Party prior notice of the meeting or conversation and, unless prohibited by any such Governmental Entity, the opportunity to attend or participate. Each of the Company and Parent shall consult and cooperate with one another in connection with any analyses, appearances, presentations, memoranda, briefs, arguments, opinions and proposals made or submitted by or on behalf of any Party in connection with proceedings under or relating to the HSR Act, any Foreign Competition Law, the Exon-Florio Amendment or CFIUS. Each of the Company and Parent agrees not to extend, directly or indirectly, any waiting period under the HSR Act, any Foreign Competition Law or the Exon-Florio Amendment or enter into any agreement with a Governmental Entity to delay or not to consummate the transactions 

   #####

written communications between such Party or any of its Subsidiaries,
Affiliates or Representatives and any Governmental Entity or its respective

 (c) Without limiting the generality of each Partys obligations pursuant to _Section 6.4(b),_ each of the Company and Parent shall use its best efforts to obtain, as promptly as practicable, any clearance required under the HSR Act, any Foreign Competition Law and the Exon-Florio Amendment or from CFIUS for the consummation of the Merger, including, in the case of Parent, by (i) selling, holding separate or otherwise disposing of, or proposing and agreeing to sell, hold separate or otherwise dispose of, or permitting the sale, holding separate or other disposition of, any assets of Parent or its Subsidiaries, or after the Closing, the Company, its Subsidiaries, GrowHow, HATLP, OCOP or PLNL, and (ii) conducting its business in a specified manner, or proposing and agreeing or permitting Parent or its Subsidiaries, or after the Closing, the Company, its Subsidiaries, GrowHow, HATLP, OCOP or PLNL, to conduct its business in a specified manner (each a " _Divestiture Action_ "); _provided_ , _however_ , that, in no event shall Parent be required to agree, pursuant to any Divestiture Action, to take any action that would reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on the Company (without giving effect to clause (viii) of the definition thereof). In the event that any administrative or judicial action or proceeding is instituted (or threatened to be instituted) challenging any transaction contemplated by this Agreement as violative of any competition, antitrust or foreign investment Law or of the Exon-Florio Amendment, or if any Law is enacted, entered, promulgated or enforced by a Governmental Entity that would make the transactions contemplated by this Agreement illegal or would otherwise prohibit or materially impair or delay the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, Parent shall use its best efforts to resolve, contest and resist any such action or proceeding and to have vacated, lifted, reversed or overturned any Order, whether temporary, preliminary or permanent, that is in effect and that prohibits, prevents, delays or restricts consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and to have such Law repealed, rescinded or made inapplicable so as to permit prompt consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including by taking any Divestiture Action. 

  

 Section 6.5 _No Solicitation_. 

   

 (a) The Company shall not, nor shall it authorize or permit any of its Subsidiaries to, and it shall cause its and its Subsidiaries respective Representatives not to, directly or indirectly: (i) initiate or solicit or knowingly facilitate or encourage (it being understood that providing information in the ordinary course of business consistent with past practice to categories of Persons to whom the Company routinely provides such information in the ordinary course of business consistent with past practice will not, in and of itself, constitute encouragement hereunder) any inquiry or the making of any proposal that constitutes a Takeover Proposal or (ii) continue or otherwise participate in any discussions or negotiations regarding, furnish to any Person any information or data or access to its properties with respect to, or otherwise cooperate with or knowingly take any other action to facilitate any proposal that constitutes any Takeover Proposal. The Company shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries and its and their respective Representatives to, immediately cease and cause to be terminated all 

   ##### 

  

    

existing discussions or negotiations with any Person conducted heretofore with
respect to any Takeover Proposal (and shall not waive or otherwise modify any
existing standstill provision or confidentiality agreement that benefits the
Company) and request from each Person that has executed a confidentiality
agreement with the Company the prompt return or destruction of
any confidential information previously furnished to such Person in
connection therewith. Notwithstanding the foregoing, prior to receipt of the
Company Stockholder Approval, the Company and its Representatives, in
response to a bona fide written Takeover Proposal that was made after the
date of this Agreement and did not result from a material breach of this
Agreement and that (1) constitutes a Superior Proposal or (2) the Board of
Directors of the Company determines in good faith (after consultation with
outside counsel and a financial advisor of nationally recognized reputation)
could reasonably be expected to result in a Superior Proposal, shall
be permitted to: (A) provide access to non-public information to the Person
making such Takeover Proposal pursuant to and in accordance with an executed
confidentiality agreement not less restrictive of the other party than the
Confidentiality Agreement; _provided_ that all such information provided to
such Person has previously been provided to Parent or is provided to Parent
prior to or substantially concurrently with the time it is provided to such
Person; and (B) participate in discussions or negotiations with respect to
such Takeover Proposal with the Person making such Takeover Proposal. 

   

 (b) From and after the date of this Agreement, as promptly as practicable after the receipt, directly or indirectly, by the Company of any Takeover Proposal or any inquiry with respect to, or that could reasonably be expected to lead to, any Takeover Proposal, and in any case within two (2) Business Days after the receipt thereof, the Company shall provide oral and written notice to Parent of (i) such Takeover Proposal or inquiry, (ii) the identity of the Person making any such Takeover Proposal or inquiry and (iii) the material terms and conditions of any such Takeover Proposal or inquiry. The Company shall keep Parent fully informed on a current basis of the status of any such Takeover Proposal, including any changes to the terms and conditions thereof. 

   

 (c) At any time prior to receipt of the Company Stockholder Approval, the Board of Directors of the Company may (i) effect a Change in Company Recommendation; _provided_  that the Board of Directors of the Company determines in good faith, after consultation with outside counsel, that the failure to do so would be inconsistent with its duties to the stockholders of the Company under applicable Law, and (ii) in response to a Superior Proposal that was made after the date of this Agreement and did not result from a material breach of this Agreement, cause the Company to terminate this Agreement and concurrently with such termination, upon payment of the Termination Fee pursuant to _Section 8.2(b)(i)_, enter into a definitive agreement with respect to such Superior Proposal. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company shall not be entitled to exercise its right to effect a Change in Company Recommendation or its right to terminate this Agreement pursuant hereto unless (A) the Board of Directors of the Company shall have first provided prior written notice to Parent advising Parent that the Board of Directors of the Company intends to (x) effect a Change in Company Recommendation (a " _Notice of Change in Company Recommendation_ ") which notice shall contain a description of the events, facts and circumstances giving rise to such proposed action or (y) terminate this Agreement pursuant to this _Section 6.5(c)_ in response to a Superior Proposal (a " _Notice of Superior Proposal_ ") which notice shall contain a description of the terms and conditions of the Superior Proposal (including a copy of any such written Superior 

   ##### 

  

    

Proposal) and (B) Parent does not make, within five (5) Business Days after
receipt of such Notice of Change in Company Recommendation or Notice of
Superior Proposal, as the case may be (it being understood and agreed that,
with respect to a Notice of Superior Proposal, any amendment to the financial
terms or any other material term of such Superior Proposal shall require a new
Notice of Superior Proposal and a new five (5) Business Day period), a
proposal that would, in the good faith determination of the Board of
Directors of the Company (after consultation with outside counsel and a
financial advisor of nationally recognized reputation), cause such events,
facts and circumstances to no longer form the basis for the Board of
Directors of the Company to effect a Change in Company Recommendation, in the
case of a Change in Company Recommendation, or be at least as favorable to
the stockholders of the Company as such Superior Proposal, in the case of a
Notice of Superior Proposal. The Company agrees that, during the five (5)
Business Day period after Parents receipt of a Notice of Change in Company
Recommendation or Notice of Superior Proposal, as the case may be, the
Company and its Representatives shall negotiate in good faith with Parent and
its Representatives regarding any revisions to the terms of this Agreement
proposed by Parent. 

   

 (d) Nothing contained in this _Section 6.5_ shall prohibit the Company from (i) taking, and disclosing to its stockholders, a position contemplated by Rule 14e-2(a) under the Exchange Act or a statement required under Rule 14d-9 under the Exchange Act or (ii) making any disclosure to stockholders of the Company that is required by applicable Law; _provided_ ,  _however_ , that the taking of any such position or making of any such disclosure contemplated by clauses (i) or (ii) above shall be subject to and only taken in compliance with  _Section 6.2_ and, to the extent applicable, _Section 6.5(c)_. 

  

 Section 6.6 _Employee Matters_. 

   

 (a) From the Closing Date through no earlier than December 31 of the calendar year following the calendar year in which the Closing Date occurs (the " _Continuation Period_ "), the Surviving Corporation shall cause each individual who is employed by the Company and any Company Subsidiary immediately before the Effective Time (each, a " _Continuing Employee_ ") to be provided with (i) base compensation and bonus or incentive opportunities that are no less favorable in the aggregate than the base compensation and bonus or incentive opportunities (including value attributable to equity-based compensation) provided to such Continuing Employee immediately prior to the Effective Time and (ii) employee benefits that are substantially comparable in the aggregate to those provided to such Continuing Employee immediately prior to the Effective Time. Except to the extent necessary to avoid the duplication of benefits, the Surviving Corporation shall recognize the service of each Continuing Employee prior to the Effective Time as if such service had been performed with Parent or its Affiliates (A) for all purposes under the Company Benefit Plans maintained by the Surviving Corporation or its Affiliates after the Effective Time (to the extent such plans, programs or agreements are provided to Continuing Employees), (B) for purposes of eligibility and vesting under any employee benefit plans and programs of the Surviving Corporation or its ERISA Affiliates other than the Company Benefit Plans (the " _Surviving Corporation Plans_ ") in which the Continuing Employee participates after the Effective Time and (C) for purposes of determination of benefit accruals and benefit levels with respect to vacation, paid time off and severance under any Surviving Corporation Plan in which the Continuing Employee participates after the Effective Time (excluding, for the avoidance of doubt, benefit accrual 

   ##### 

  

    

under any defined benefit pension plans and non-qualified retirement plans),
in each case to the same extent such Continuing Employees service was
recognized by the Company and the Company Subsidiaries under the
corresponding Company Benefit Plan in which such Continuing
Employee participated immediately before the Effective Time. In addition, and
without limiting the generality of the foregoing, each Continuing Employee
shall be immediately eligible to participate, without any waiting time, in
any and all Surviving Corporation Plans to the extent coverage under any such
plan replaces coverage under a comparable benefit plan in which
such Continuing Employee participates immediately before the Effective Time.
For the avoidance of doubt, the Surviving Corporation shall have no
obligation to grant equity awards to the Continuing Employees. 

   

 (b) With respect to any welfare plan maintained by the Surviving Corporation or its Affiliates in which Continuing Employees are eligible to participate after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation and its Affiliates shall (i) waive all limitations as to pre-existing conditions, exclusions and waiting periods and actively-at-work requirements with respect to participation and coverage requirements applicable to such employees and their eligible dependents and beneficiaries, to the extent such limitations were waived, satisfied or did not apply to the applicable employee or eligible dependent or beneficiary under the corresponding welfare Company Benefit Plan in which he or she participated immediately prior to the Effective Time, and (ii) provide each Continuing Employee and his or her eligible dependents and beneficiaries with credit for any co-payments and deductibles paid prior to the Effective Time in satisfying any analogous deductible or out-of-pocket requirements to the extent applicable under any such plan and to the same extent such credit was provided to him or her under the corresponding welfare Company Benefit Plan in which he or she participated immediately prior to the Effective Time, in each case without duplication of benefits. 

   

 (c) Without limiting the generality of _Section 6.6(a)_, from and after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation and its Affiliates shall assume, honor and continue during the Continuation Period, or if sooner, until all obligations thereunder have been satisfied, all of the Company Benefit Plans that are employment, severance, retention and termination plans, policies, programs, agreements and arrangements (including any change in control severance agreement between the Company and any Continuing Employee) maintained by the Company or any Company Subsidiary, in each case as in effect at the Effective Time and as set forth on  _Section 6.6(c)_ of the Company Disclosure Letter, including with respect to any payments, benefits or rights arising as a result of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (either alone or in combination with any other event), without any amendment or modification, other than (i) as required pursuant to the terms of any Company Benefit Plan (including any collective bargaining agreement) as in effect on the date of this Agreement, (ii) as required to comply with applicable Law or GAAP or (iii) as expressly permitted by this Agreement. 

   

 (d) Without limiting the generality of _Section 6.6(a)_, with respect to the annual performance period in which the Effective Time occurs, the Surviving Corporation and its Affiliates shall (i) honor and continue in all material respects the Company Benefit Plans that are cash incentive compensation plans maintained by the Company and any Company Subsidiary at the Effective Time, as set forth on _Section 6.6(d)_ of the Company Disclosure Letter (the " _Incentive Plans_ "), pursuant to their respective terms (except as modified by the 

   ##### 

  

    

following clauses (ii) and (iii)) as in effect at the Effective Time with
respect to the annual performance period thereunder commencing prior to and
ending after the Effective Time, (ii) at the time(s) prescribed by the
Incentive Plans as in effect at the Effective Time, make payments to the
Continuing Employees in accordance with the applicable material terms of the
Incentive Plans as in effect at the Effective Time (subject to any plan
provision requiring an employee to remain continuously employed following the
end of the relevant performance period and up to the date that payments under
the applicable Incentive Plan are made) and (iii) provide any Continuing
Employee whose employment is terminated by Parent, the Surviving Corporation
or their Subsidiaries without "Cause" (as such term is defined in _Section
6.6(d)_ of the Company Disclosure Letter) prior to the time at which such
payments are made with an amount in cash as described on _Section 6.6(d)_ of
the Company Disclosure Letter, prorated to reflect the portion of such annual
performance period that elapsed prior to such termination (if
such termination occurs prior to the end of such performance period), payable
at the same time such bonus (if any) would have been paid had such
termination not occurred (but in any event within the period required by
Section 409A of the Code, such that it qualifies as a "short-term deferral"
pursuant to Section 1.409A-1(b)(4) of the Department of Treasury
Regulations). 

   

 (e) Without limiting the generality of _Section 6.6(a)_, during the Continuation Period, if the Surviving Corporation and its Affiliates terminate the employment of any Continuing Employee (other than any employee who is party to a Company Benefit Plan that is an employment, change in control, severance or other individual agreement) other than for Cause, the Surviving Corporation and its Affiliates shall pay to such Continuing Employee severance in an amount equal to the greater of (i) the severance benefits due under the applicable severance plan, policy or guidelines of the Surviving Corporation and its Affiliates then in effect for similarly situated employees of the Surviving Corporation and its Affiliates, and (ii) the severance benefits that would have been due under the applicable severance plan, policy or guidelines of the Company or any Company Subsidiary that was applicable to such Continuing Employee immediately prior to the Effective Time. Without limiting the generality of  _Section 6.6(a)_, the level of severance benefits a terminated Continuing Employee is entitled to receive pursuant to clauses (i) and (ii) of the preceding sentence shall be determined by taking into account such employees service with the Company and any Company Subsidiary (and any predecessor) prior to the Effective Time (to the same extent such service would have been recognized under the severance plan, policy or guidelines of the Company or any Company Subsidiary that was applicable to such Continuing Employee immediately prior to the Effective Time) and such employees service with the Surviving Corporation and its Affiliates on and after the Effective Time. 

   

 (f) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, Parent, Merger Sub and the Company acknowledge and agree that all provisions contained in this _Section 6.6_ are included for the sole benefit of Parent, Merger Sub and the Company, and that nothing in this Agreement, whether express or implied, (i) shall be treated as an amendment or other modification of any Company Benefit Plan or other employee benefit plan, agreement or other arrangement, (ii) shall limit the right of Parent, Merger Sub, the Company or their respective Affiliates to amend, terminate or otherwise modify any Company Benefit Plan or other employee benefit plan, agreement or other arrangement following the Effective Time, or (iii) shall create any third party beneficiary or other right (x) in any other Person, including, without limitation, any current or former director, officer, employee or independent contractor of the 

   ##### 

  

    

Company or any Company Subsidiary or any participant in any Company Benefit
Plan or other employee benefit plan, agreement or other arrangement (or any
dependent or beneficiary thereof) or (y) to continued employment with Parent,
Merger Sub, the Company or any of their respective Affiliates. 

  

 Section 6.7 _Fees and Expenses_. Whether or not the Merger is consummated, all expenses incurred in connection with this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby shall be paid by the Party incurring such expenses. 

  

 Section 6.8 _Directors  and Officers Indemnification and Insurance_. 

   

 (a) From and after the Effective Time, Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to the greatest extent permitted by Law (a) to indemnify and hold harmless, against any costs or expenses (including attorneys fees), judgments, fines, losses, claims, damages or liabilities incurred in connection with any claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative, and provide advancement of expenses (without requiring a preliminary determination as to the ultimate entitlement to indemnification) to, all past and present directors and officers of the Company (in all of their capacities) (the " _Indemnified Persons_ ") to the same extent such persons are indemnified or have the right to advancement of expenses as of the date of this Agreement by the Company pursuant to the Companys Constituent Documents and indemnification agreements, if any, in existence on the date hereof with any Indemnified Persons and (b) to honor the provisions regarding elimination of liability of directors, indemnification of officers and directors and advancement of expenses contained in the Companys Constituent Documents and indemnification agreements immediately prior to the Effective Time. 

   

 (b) From and after the Effective Time, Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to maintain for a period of six (6) years after the Effective Time the current policies of directors and officers liability insurance and fiduciary liability insurance (" _D and O Insurance_") maintained by the Company; _provided_ that the Surviving Corporation may substitute therefor policies of at least the same coverage and amounts containing terms and conditions which are, individually and in the aggregate, at least as protective and no less advantageous to the insured with respect to claims arising from facts or events that occurred on or before the Effective Time (including for acts or omissions occurring in connection with the approval of this Agreement and the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby);  _provided_ , _further_ , that in no event shall the Surviving Corporation be required to expend in any one year more than 300% of the current annual premium expended by the Company and the Company Subsidiaries to maintain or procure such D and O Insurance immediately prior to the Effective Time (such 300% amount, the " _Maximum Annual Premium_ "); _provided_ ,  _further_ , that if the annual premiums of such insurance coverage exceed such amount, the Surviving Corporation shall obtain a policy with the greatest coverage available for a cost not exceeding the Maximum Annual Premium. Alternatively, prior to the Effective Time, either Parent or, if Parent does not do so prior to three (3) Business Days prior to the Closing, the Company may purchase a six-year prepaid "tail" policy containing terms and conditions which are, individually and in the aggregate, at least as protective and no less advantageous to the insured than the D and O Insurance maintained by the Company with respect to claims arising from facts or events that occurred on or before the Effective Time (including for acts or omissions 

   ##### 

  

    

occurring in connection with the approval of this Agreement and the
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby); _provided_ , _however_
, that in no event shall any policy require payment of aggregate premiums for
such insurance in excess of the aggregate Maximum Annual Premium for such
six-year period. If such prepaid "tail" policy has been obtained by the
Company, Parent shall cause such policy to be maintained in full force
and effect, for its full term, and cause all obligations thereunder to be
honored by it and the Surviving Corporation. 

   

 (c) The obligations of the Surviving Corporation under this _Section 6.8_ shall not be terminated or modified in such a manner as to adversely affect any indemnitee to whom this  _Section 6.8_ applies without the consent of such affected indemnitee (it being expressly agreed that the indemnitees to whom this _Section 6.8_ applies shall be third-party beneficiaries of this _Section 6.8_). 

  

 Section 6.9 _Public Announcements_. Parent and the Company shall develop a joint communications plan and each Party shall (a) unless otherwise required by applicable Law, ensure that all press releases and other public statements or communications with respect to the transactions contemplated hereby shall be consistent with such joint communications plan and (b) unless otherwise required by applicable Law or by obligations pursuant to any listing agreement with or rules of any securities exchange, consult with each other before issuing any press release or, to the extent practicable, otherwise making any public statement or communication with respect to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby. 

  

 Section 6.10 _Notice of Certain Events_.

Each of the Company and Parent shall give the other Party the opportunity to participate in, subject to a customary joint defense agreement, but not control the defense or settlement of any such litigation, shall give due consideration to the other Partys advice with respect to such litigation and shall not settle any such litigation without the prior written consent of the other Party (not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed). 

   ##### 

  

  

 Section 6.13 _Company Series A Preferred Stock_. 

   

 (a) As promptly as reasonably practicable following the date of this Agreement, the Company shall exercise its right (the " _Preferred Stock Conversion Right_ ") pursuant to Section 8 of the provisions of the charter of the Company establishing the terms of the Company Series A Preferred Stock (the " _Preferred Stock Conversion Provisions_ ") to require all holders of Company Series A Preferred Stock to convert such shares of Company Series A Preferred Stock into shares of Company Common Stock on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in the Preferred Stock Conversion Provisions (the " _Preferred Stock Conversion_ "). The Companys exercise of its Preferred Stock Conversion Right and the Preferred Stock Conversion shall be conducted in accordance with the terms of the Preferred Stock Conversion Provisions;  _provided_ , that the date the Preferred Stock Conversion is to be effective shall be no later than one Business Day prior to the Closing Date. 

   

 (b) Subject to _Section 6.13(a)_, the Company shall take all action necessary to consummate the Preferred Stock Conversion, to comply in all material respects with all Laws and regulations applicable thereto, and to prepare and, if necessary, execute all documents as may be necessary to consummate the Preferred Stock Conversion. 

  

 Section 6.14 _Transfer Taxes_. If the Effective Time occurs, all stock transfer, real estate transfer, documentary, stamp, recording and other similar taxes (including interest, penalties and additions to any such taxes) incurred in connection with this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby shall, except as provided by _Section 2.9(c)_, be paid by Parent. 

  

 Section 6.15 _Financing_. Parent shall use its reasonable best efforts (a) to arrange financing that is sufficient to permit Parent and Merger Sub to consummate the Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby (the " _Financing_ ") and (b) to enter into, prior to the date of the Parent Stockholders Meeting, an underwriting agreement with one or more financial institutions pursuant to which such financial institutions shall commit to underwrite a rights offering by Parent (the " _Rights Issue_ "), which underwriting commitment shall cover the portion of the Rights Issue in excess of the pro rata share of the Norwegian Ministry of Trade and Industry and the Norwegian National Insurance Scheme Fund, and the proceeds of which will be used to provide Parent with a portion of the Financing to the extent the Rights Issue is undersubscribed. 

  

 Section 6.16 _Assistance with Financing_. 

   

 (a) In order to assist Parent in any way necessary, proper or advisable in connection with Parents arrangement of the Financing, the Company shall, and shall cause each of its Subsidiaries to, at the expense of Parent, provide such assistance and cooperation as Parent, Merger Sub and their Affiliates may reasonably request in connection with the arrangement of the Financing and the satisfaction, on a timely basis, of all conditions applicable to Parent and Merger Sub (or its or their Affiliates) in any definitive documents relating thereto including, (i) furnishing to Parent and its Representatives, to the extent reasonably available, pertinent information with respect to the Company and its Subsidiaries (or, to the extent required and reasonably available to it, GrowHow, HATLP, OCOP or PLNL) and their respective operations to be included in the Parent Circular, the Rights Offer Prospectus and any other prospectus, offering memorandum, rating agency presentations, bank book, information 

   ##### 

  

    

memorandum, lender presentation or similar document or marketing material
(including historical financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP
and projected financial statements of the Company for inclusion in any
such document, the " _Required Information_ "), and assisting in the
preparation of such documents (including the preparation of any pro forma
financial information required to be included in any such document) and
cooperating with and attending a reasonable number of meetings with
prospective investors or lenders, (ii) requesting its independent accountants
to provide reasonable assistance to Parent or Merger Sub consistent with
their customary practice (including to provide consent to Parent or Merger
Sub to prepare and use their audit reports relating to the Company and any
necessary "comfort letters" in each case on customary terms and consistent
with their customary practice in connection with the Financing), (iii)
providing reasonable cooperation with prospective investors, arrangers and
lenders and their respective advisors in performing their due diligence and
(iv) providing all required information reasonably available to it relating
to any indebtedness of the Company or its Subsidiaries whose terms require or
permit it to be declared due and payable, or provide that it
becomes automatically due and payable, prior to its stated maturity as a
result of, or in connection with, the Merger. The Company will use its
reasonable best efforts to update the Required Information from time to time
as may be necessary such that such Required Information does not contain any
untrue statement of material fact or omit to state any material fact
necessary in order to make the statements therein not misleading. 

   

 (b) In no event shall the Company or its Subsidiaries be required to pay any commitment or similar fee or incur any other liability in connection with the Financing prior to the Effective Time. The requested cooperation shall not unreasonably interfere with the ongoing operations of the Company and its Subsidiaries or otherwise materially impair the ability of any officer or executive of the Company to carry out their duties to the Company. 

   

 (c) Parent and Merger Sub shall indemnify and hold harmless the Company and its Subsidiaries and its and their directors, officers, employees and agents from and against any and all losses or damages suffered or incurred by them in connection with the arrangement of the Financing and any information utilized in connection therewith; _provided_ ,  _however_ , that the foregoing shall not apply to the Companys or its Subsidiaries or other Representatives willful misconduct or gross negligence. 

  

 Section 6.17 _Dividend Matters_. If the Company has declared and set a record date for a regular quarterly cash dividend payable to the Companys stockholders for the quarter ended prior to the quarter in which the Effective Time occurs (the " _Final Full Quarterly Dividend_ "), and the Effective Time occurs prior to the payment date for the Final Full Quarterly Dividend, then Parent or the Surviving Corporation will pay the Final Full Quarterly Dividend on behalf of the Company following the Closing on the scheduled payment date for such dividend. 

  

 Section 6.18 _No Financing Condition_. For the avoidance of doubt, the obligation of Parent and Merger Sub to close the transactions contemplated by this Agreement is conditioned upon the receipt of the Parent Stockholder Approval but is not conditioned upon the consummation of the Financing and, accordingly, the Parties agree that a failure of Parent and Merger Sub to close the transactions contemplated by this Agreement resulting from a failure or inability to consummate the Financing constitutes a breach for purposes of this Agreement. 

   ##### 

  

  

 Section 6.19 _Parent s Vote at Company Stockholders Meeting_. Parent shall vote all shares of Company Common Stock beneficially owned by it or any of its Subsidiaries in favor of the Merger at the Company Stockholders Meeting.

Parent shall cause Merger Sub or the Surviving Corporation, as applicable, to perform all of its respective agreements, covenants and obligations under this Agreement and Merger Sub shall not engage in any activities of any nature except as provided in or contemplated by this Agreement.

   ##### 

  

    

Agreement are for reference purposes only and shall not affect in any way the
meaning or interpretation of this Agreement. Whenever the word "include,"
"includes" or "including" is used in this Agreement, it shall be deemed to be
followed by the words "without limitation". The words "hereby",
"hereof", "herein" and "hereunder" and words of similar import when used in
this Agreement shall refer to this Agreement as a whole and not to any
particular provision of this Agreement. The words "date hereof" shall refer
to the date of this Agreement. The term "or" is not exclusive. The
word "extent" in the phrase "to the extent" shall mean the degree to which a
subject or other thing extends, and such phrase shall not mean simply "if".
The words describing the singular number shall include the plural and vice
versa and words denoting any gender shall include all genders. The Parties
have participated jointly in the negotiation and drafting of this Agreement.
In the event an ambiguity or a question of intent or interpretation arises,
this Agreement shall be construed as if drafted jointly by the Parties and no
presumption or burden of proof shall arise favoring or disfavoring any Party
by virtue of the authorship of any provisions of this Agreement. 

  

 Section 9.4 _Counterparts; Effectiveness_. This Agreement may be executed in two or more counterparts, each of which shall be deemed to be an original, but all of which shall constitute one and the same instrument. This Agreement shall become effective when each Party hereto shall have received counterparts thereof signed and delivered (by telecopy or otherwise) by the other Parties hereto. 

  

 Section 9.5 _Entire Agreement; Third Party Beneficiaries_. 

   

 (a) This Agreement (including the Company Disclosure Letter and the Exhibits hereto), together with the Confidentiality Agreement, constitute the entire agreement, and supersede all prior agreements and understandings, both written and oral, between the Parties with respect to the subject matter hereof and thereof. 

   

 (b) This Agreement shall be binding upon and inure solely to the benefit of each Party hereto, and nothing in this Agreement, express or implied, is intended to or shall confer upon any Person not a Party to this Agreement any rights, benefits or remedies of any nature whatsoever, other than _Section 6.8_ (which is intended to be for the benefit of the Persons covered thereby and may be enforced by such Persons). Notwithstanding the immediately preceding sentence, following the Effective Time, the provisions of _ARTICLE II_ shall be enforceable by holders of Certificates. 

  

 Section 9.6 _Severability_. If any term or other provision of this Agreement is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced by any law or public policy, all other terms and provisions of this Agreement shall nevertheless remain in full force and effect so long as the economic or legal substance of the transactions contemplated hereby is not affected in any manner materially adverse to any Party. Notwithstanding the foregoing, upon such determination that any term or other provision is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced, the Parties shall negotiate in good faith to modify this Agreement so as to effect the original intent of the Parties as closely as possible in an acceptable manner in order that the transactions contemplated hereby are consummated as originally contemplated to the greatest extent possible. 

   ##### 

  

  

 Section 9.7 _Assignment_. Neither this Agreement nor any of the rights, interests or obligations hereunder shall be assigned by any of the Parties, in whole or in part (whether by operation of Law or otherwise), without the prior written consent of the other Parties, and any attempt to make any such assignment without such consent shall be null and void; _provided_ , that Parent and Merger Sub may assign their rights and obligations pursuant to this Agreement to any direct or indirect wholly-owned Subsidiary of Parent so long as Parent continues to remain primarily liable for all of such rights and obligations. Subject to the preceding sentence, this Agreement will be binding upon, inure to the benefit of, and be enforceable by, the Parties and their respective successors and permitted assigns. 

  

 Section 9.8 _Amendment_. This Agreement may be amended by the Parties at any time before or after approval of the matters presented in connection with the Merger by the stockholders of the Company or the stockholders of Parent, but, after such approval, no amendment shall be made which by Law requires further approval by such stockholders without such further approval. This Agreement may not be amended except by an instrument in writing signed on behalf of each of the Parties. 

  

 Section 9.9 _Extension; Waiver_. At any time prior to the Effective Time, the Parties may, to the extent legally allowed, (a) extend the time for the performance of any of the obligations or other acts of the other Parties, (b) waive any inaccuracies in the representations and warranties contained herein or in any document delivered pursuant hereto and (c) waive compliance with any of the agreements or conditions contained herein. Any agreement on the part of a Party hereto to any such extension or waiver shall be valid only if set forth in a written instrument signed on behalf of such Party. The failure of any Party to this Agreement to assert any of its rights under this Agreement or otherwise shall not constitute a waiver of those rights.

 (a) All disputes arising out of or concerning the existence, validity interpretation or performance of this Agreement shall be resolved by binding arbitration administered by the American Arbitration Association (" _AAA_ ") pursuant to its Commercial Arbitration Rules in accordance with _Section 9.10(b)_. 

   

 (b) The arbitral panel shall consist of three members, one to be appointed by each of the Parties (with Parent and Merger Sub being treated as a single Party for purposes of this  _Section 9.10_) and the third to be chosen by the two party-appointed arbitrators. If the responding Party fails to appoint an arbitrator or the two party-appointed arbitrators fail to appoint the third within the prescribed time periods, then the appointments shall be made by the AAA pursuant to its rules and procedures in effect at the time of the appointments: 

   

 (i) Arbitration may be commenced by any Party by giving written notice to the other Party and to the AAA pursuant to the rules of the AAA then in existence. Within 15 days of such notice, the Party demanding arbitration shall appoint its arbitrator. Within 15 days of that appointment, the other Party shall appoint its arbitrator. Within 15 days after the appointment of both Party-appointed arbitrators, those two shall appoint the third, who shall preside over the panel. 

   ##### 

  

   

 (ii) The situs of the arbitration shall be the State of Delaware and the evidentiary proceedings shall be conducted in Wilmington, Delaware. The panel may conduct proceedings in other locations if necessary for the taking of evidence. 

   

 (iii) Each arbitrator shall be impartial and shall be a retired Delaware Chancery Court judge or Delaware Supreme Court justice, or, if not reasonably available, shall otherwise be knowledgeable about and experienced with the law of Delaware and have had at least 15 years of legal experience in the area of mergers and acquisitions. 

   

 (iv) In connection with any arbitration proceeding hereunder, the arbitral panel shall allow reasonable requests for the production of documents relevant to the dispute and permit the taking of depositions limited to not more than seven persons on each side and for not more than 70 hours in total for each side. The panel may seek to compel the production of evidence from non-Parties. 

   

 (c) The arbitral panel is authorized to award monetary damages and to grant specific performance of the Agreement and other injunctive relief, including interim relief pending the final award. 

   

 (d) The Parties shall bear their own costs incurred in connection with the arbitration and share equally the fees and expenses of the arbitral panel and the costs of administration. 

   

 (e) The arbitral award shall be final and non-appealable and may be enforced in any court of competent jurisdiction. 

   

 (f) THIS AGREEMENT SHALL BE DEEMED TO BE MADE IN ACCORDANCE WITH, AND IN ALL RESPECTS SHALL BE INTERPRETED, CONSTRUED AND GOVERNED BY AND IN ACCORDANCE WITH, THE LAW OF THE STATE OF DELAWARE WITHOUT REGARD TO ITS RULES OF CONFLICTS OF LAW TO THE EXTENT THAT THE APPLICATION OF THE LAWS OF ANOTHER JURISDICTION WOULD BE REQUIRED THEREBY, EXCEPT FOR SUCH PROVISIONS WHERE THE MGCL IS MANDATORILY APPLICABLE, WHICH PROVISIONS SHALL BE GOVERNED BY AND CONSTRUED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE MGCL; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, THAT THE MGCL SHALL GOVERN THE RELATIVE RIGHTS, OBLIGATIONS, POWERS, DUTIES AND OTHER INTERNAL AFFAIRS OF THE COMPANY AND THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS OF THE COMPANY. 

   

 (g) With respect to any matter not subject to arbitration under this Section of the Agreement, each Party hereby irrevocably consents to the exclusive jurisdiction of the courts of the State of Delaware and waives any objection to personal jurisdiction of and venue in such court with respect to such proceeding and any claim that such forum is inconvenient. EACH PARTY ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES THAT ANY CONTROVERSY WHICH MAY ARISE UNDER THIS AGREEMENT IS LIKELY TO 

   ##### 

  

    

INVOLVE COMPLICATED AND DIFFICULT ISSUES, AND THEREFORE EACH SUCH PARTY HEREBY
IRREVOCABLY AND UNCONDITIONALLY WAIVES ANY RIGHT SUCH PARTY MAY HAVE TO A
TRIAL BY JURY IN RESPECT OF ANY LITIGATION DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY ARISING OUT
OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED BY THIS
AGREEMENT. 

   

 (h) PARENT HEREBY IRREVOCABLY DESIGNATES NATIONAL CORPORATE RESEARCH, LTD. (IN SUCH CAPACITY THE " _PROCESS AGENT_ "), WITH AN OFFICE AT 615 SOUTH DUPONT HIGHWAY, DOVER, DE 19901, AS ITS DESIGNEE, APPOINTEE AND AGENT TO RECEIVE, FOR AND ON ITS BEHALF SERVICE OF PROCESS IN SUCH JURISDICTION IN ANY LEGAL ACTION OR PROCEEDINGS WITH RESPECT TO THIS AGREEMENT OR ANY OTHER AGREEMENT EXECUTED IN CONNECTION WITH THIS AGREEMENT, AND SUCH SERVICE SHALL BE DEEMED COMPLETE UPON DELIVERY THEREOF TO THE PROCESS AGENT. NOTHING HEREIN SHALL AFFECT THE RIGHT OF ANY PARTY TO SERVE PROCESS IN ANY OTHER MANNER PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW. 

   

 (i) EACH PARTY ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES THAT ANY CONTROVERSY WHICH MAY ARISE UNDER THIS AGREEMENT IS LIKELY TO INVOLVE COMPLICATED AND DIFFICULT ISSUES, AND THEREFORE EACH SUCH PARTY HEREBY IRREVOCABLY AND UNCONDITIONALLY WAIVES ANY RIGHT SUCH PARTY MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN RESPECT OF ANY LITIGATION DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED BY THIS AGREEMENT. EACH PARTY CERTIFIES AND ACKNOWLEDGES THAT (i) NO REPRESENTATIVE, AGENT OR ATTORNEY OF ANY OTHER PARTY HAS REPRESENTED, EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE, THAT SUCH OTHER PARTY WOULD NOT, IN THE EVENT OF LITIGATION, SEEK TO ENFORCE THE FOREGOING WAIVER, (ii) EACH PARTY UNDERSTANDS AND HAS CONSIDERED THE IMPLICATIONS OF THIS WAIVER, (iii) EACH PARTY MAKES THIS WAIVER VOLUNTARILY AND (iv) EACH PARTY HAS BEEN INDUCED TO ENTER INTO THIS AGREEMENT BY, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE MUTUAL WAIVERS AND CERTIFICATIONS IN THIS  _Section 9.10(i)_. 

  

 Section 9.11 _Specific Enforcement_. The Parties hereto agree that irreparable damage would occur in the event that any provision of this Agreement was not performed in accordance with its specific terms or was otherwise breached. It is accordingly agreed that the Parties shall be entitled to an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions hereof in any court of competent jurisdiction without proof of damages or otherwise (and each Party hereby waives any requirement for the securing or posting of any bond in connection with such remedy), this being in addition to any other remedy to which they are entitled at law or in equity. The right for specific enforcement shall include the right of the Company to cause Parent and Merger Sub to cause the Merger and the transactions contemplated by the Merger to be consummated on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement. The Parties further agree not to assert that a remedy of specific enforcement is unenforceable, invalid, contrary to Law or inequitable for any reason, nor to assert that a remedy of monetary damages would provide an adequate remedy. If, prior to the Walk-Away Date or Extended Walk-Away Date (if applicable), any Party brings any action to enforce specifically the 

   ##### 

  

    

performance of the terms and provisions hereof by any other Party, the Walk-
Away Date or Extended Walk-Away Date (if applicable) shall automatically be
extended by (x) the amount of time during which such action is pending,
plus twenty (20) Business Days or (y) such other time period established by
the court presiding over such action.

The Board of Directors may authorize the issuance from time to time of shares of stock of the Corporation of any class or series, whether now or hereafter authorized, or securities or rights convertible into shares of its stock of any class or series, whether now or hereafter authorized, for such consideration as the Board of Directors may deem advisable (or without consideration in the case of a stock split or stock dividend), subject to such restrictions or limitations, if any, as may be set forth in the charter (the "Charter") or the Bylaws. 

  

 Section 5.3 _Indemnification_.

Notwithstanding any provision of law permitting or requiring any action to be taken or approved by the affirmative vote of the holders of shares entitled to cast a greater number of votes, any such action shall be effective and valid if declared advisable by the Board of Directors and taken or approved by the affirmative vote of holders of shares entitled to cast a majority of all the votes entitled to be cast on the matter.

series; (iii) set or change, subject to the express terms of any class
or series of stock of the Corporation outstanding at the time, the
preferences, conversion or other rights, voting powers, restrictions,
limitations as to dividends or other distributions, qualifications and terms
and conditions of redemption for each class or series; and (iv) cause
the Corporation to file articles supplementary with the State Department of
Assessments and Taxation of Maryland. Any of the terms of any class or series
of stock set or changed pursuant to clause (iii) of this Section 6.2 may be
made dependent upon facts or events ascertainable outside the
Charter (including determinations by the Board of Directors or other facts or
events within the control of the Corporation) and may vary among holders
thereof, provided that the manner in which such facts, events or variations
shall operate upon the terms of such class or series of stock is clearly
and expressly set forth in the articles supplementary or other charter
document. 

   

 Section 6.3 _Charter and Bylaws_. The rights of all stockholders and the terms of all stock are subject to the provisions of the Charter and the Bylaws. The Board of Directors of the Corporation shall have the exclusive power to make, alter, amend or repeal the Bylaws.

AMENDMENTS 

  

 The Corporation reserves the right from time to time to make any amendment to its Charter, now or hereafter authorized by law, including any amendment altering the terms or contract rights, as expressly set forth in the Charter, of any shares of outstanding stock. All rights and powers conferred by the Charter on stockholders, directors and officers are granted subject to this reservation. 

  

ARTICLE VIII 

   

LIMITATION OF LIABILITY 

  

 To the fullest extent permitted by Maryland law, as it may be amended from time to time, no person who at any time was or is a director or officer of the Corporation shall be personally liable to the Corporation or its stockholders for money damages. No amendment of the Charter or repeal of any of its provisions shall limit or eliminate any of the benefits provided to present or former directors and present or former officers under this Article VIII in respect of any act or omission that occurred prior to such amendment or repeal.
