REGISTRATION RIGHTS

  



  

2.1  _Demand Registration_.

  



  

2.1.1  _Request for Registration_.

  



  

(a) At any time and from time to time on or after the NESR Closing Date,
Olayan may make a written demand (such holder, the " _Initiating Holder_ ")
for registration under the Securities Act of all or part of its Registrable
Securities (a " _Demand Registration_ "). Any demand for a Demand
Registration shall specify the number of Registrable Securities proposed to
be registered and the intended method(s) of distribution thereof. The
Company will notify all holders of Registrable Securities of the demand, and
each holder of Registrable Securities who wishes to include all or a
portion of such holder's Registrable Securities in the Demand Registration
(each such holder including shares of Registrable Securities in such
registration, including, without limitation, the Initiating Holder(s), a "
_Demanding Holder_ ") shall so notify the Company within fifteen (15) days
after the receipt by the holder of the notice from the Company. Upon any
such request, the Demanding Holders shall be entitled to have their
Registrable Securities included in the Demand Registration, subject to
Section 2.1.4 and the provisos set forth in Section 2.5.1(a). Olayan shall
be entitled to cause the Company to effect up to two (2) Demand
Registrations under this Section 2.1.1.

  



  

(b) the Company shall file the registration statement in respect of a
Demand Registration as soon as practicable and, in any event, within sixty
(60) days after receiving a request for a Demand Registration and shall use
reasonable best efforts to cause the same to be declared effective by the
SEC as promptly as practicable after such filing; __provided__ , __however__
, that:

  



  

(i) the Company shall not be obligated to effect a Demand Registration
pursuant to Section 2.1.1(a) within sixty (60) days after the effective date
of a previous Demand Registration, other than a Shelf Registration Statement
or Resale Shelf Registration Statement; and

  



  

(ii) the Company shall not be obligated to effect a Demand Registration
pursuant to Section 2.1.1(a) unless such demand request is for a number of
Registrable Securities with a market value that is equal to at least
$25,000,000 as of the date of such request.

  



    

| 4| 
---|---|--- 

 


--- 

    



  

2.1.2  _Effective Registration_. A registration will not count as a Demand
Registration until the Registration Statement filed with the Commission with
respect to such Demand Registration has been declared effective and the
Company has complied with all of its obligations under this
Registration Rights Agreement with respect thereto; __provided__ ,
__however__ , that if, after such Registration Statement has been declared
effective, the offering of Registrable Securities pursuant to a Demand
Registration is interfered with by any stop order or injunction of the
Commission or any other governmental agency or court, the Registration
Statement with respect to such Demand Registration will be deemed not to have
been declared effective, unless and until, (i) such stop order or injunction
is removed, rescinded or otherwise terminated, and (ii) a majority-in-
interest of the Demanding Holders thereafter elect to continue the offering;
__provided further__ that the Company shall not be obligated to file a
second Registration Statement until a Registration Statement that has been
filed is counted as a Demand Registration or is terminated.

  



  

2.1.3  _Underwritten Offering_. If the Initiating Holder so elects and
such holder so advises the Company as part of its written demand for a
Demand Registration, the offering of such Registrable Securities pursuant to
such Demand Registration shall be in the form of an underwritten offering.
In such event, the right of any holder to include its Registrable
Securities in such registration shall be conditioned upon such holder's
participation in such underwriting and the inclusion of such holder's
Registrable Securities in the underwriting to the extent provided herein. All
Demanding Holders proposing to distribute their Registrable
Securities through such underwriting shall enter into an underwriting
agreement in customary form with the Underwriter or Underwriters selected
for such underwriting by the Initiating Holder.

  



  

2.1.4  _Reduction_ _ of Offering_. If the managing Underwriter
or Underwriters for a Demand Registration that is to be an underwritten
offering advises the Company and the Demanding Holders in writing that the
dollar amount or number of shares of Registrable Securities which the
Demanding Holders desire to sell, taken together with all other Ordinary
Shares or other securities which the Company desires to sell and the
Ordinary Shares, if any, as to which registration has been requested pursuant
to written contractual piggy-back registration rights held by other
shareholders of the Company who desire to sell, exceeds the maximum dollar
amount or maximum number of shares that can be sold in such offering without
adversely affecting the proposed offering price, the timing, the
distribution method or the probability of success of such offering
(such maximum dollar amount or maximum number of shares, as applicable, the
" _Maximum Number_ _of Shares_"), then the Company shall include in
such registration: (i) first, the Registrable Securities as to which Demand
Registration has been requested by the Demanding Holders ( _pro_ _rata_ in
accordance with the number of shares that each such Person has requested be
included in such registration, regardless of the number of shares held by
each such Person (such proportion is referred to herein as " _Pro_ _ Rata_
")) that can be sold without exceeding the Maximum Number of Shares; (ii)
second, to the extent that the Maximum Number of Shares has not been reached
under the foregoing clause (i), the Ordinary Shares or other securities that
the Company desires to sell that can be sold without exceeding the Maximum
Number of Shares; and (iii) third, to the extent that the Maximum Number of
Shares has not been reached under the foregoing clauses (i) and (ii), the
Ordinary Shares or other securities for the account of other persons that
the Company is obligated to register pursuant to written contractual
arrangements with such persons and that can be sold without exceeding the
Maximum Number of Shares. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no employee of the
Company or any subsidiary thereof will be entitled to participate, directly
or indirectly, in any such registration to the extent that the managing
Underwriter or Underwriters (or, in the case of any offering that is not
underwritten, a nationally recognized investment banking firm) determines in
good faith that the participation of such employee in such registration
would adversely affect the marketability or offering price of the
securities being sold in such registration.

---|---|---

2.1.5  _Withdrawal_. If any Demanding Holder disapproves of the terms of
any underwriting or is not entitled to include all of its Registrable
Securities in any offering, such Demanding Holder may elect to
withdraw from such offering by giving written notice to the Company and the
Underwriter or Underwriters of its request to withdraw prior to the
effectiveness of the Registration Statement filed with the Commission with
respect to such Demand Registration or, if later, prior to the pricing date
of the applicable offering. If the Initiating Holder withdraws from a
proposed offering relating to a Demand Registration, then such registration
shall not count as a Demand Registration provided for in Section 2.1 by such
Initiating Holder; _provided_ that, if the registration is completed,
then the demand request will be considered to have been made by the
Demanding Holder that sells the greatest number of Registrable Securities in
the offering or, if such Demanding Holder is not entitled to any demands, to
the Demanding Holder that sells the next greatest number of shares.

  



  

2.2  _Piggy-Back Registration_.

  



  

2.2.1  _Piggy-Back Rights_. If at any time on or after the NESR Closing
Date the Company proposes to file a Registration Statement under the
Securities Act with respect to an offering of equity securities, or
securities or other obligations exercisable or exchangeable for, or
convertible into, equity securities, by the Company for its own account or
for shareholders of the Company for their account (or by the Company and by
shareholders of the Company including, without limitation, pursuant to
Section 2.1), other than a Registration Statement (i) filed in
connection with any employee stock option or other benefit plan, (ii) for an
exchange offer or offering of securities solely to the Company's existing
shareholders, (iii) for an offering of debt that is convertible into equity
securities of the Company or (iv) for a dividend reinvestment plan, then the
Company shall (x) give written notice of such proposed filing to the holders
of Registrable Securities as soon as practicable but in no event less than
ten (10) days before the anticipated filing date, which notice shall describe
the amount and type of securities to be included in such offering, the
intended method(s) of distribution, and the name of the proposed managing
Underwriter or Underwriters, if any, of the offering, and (y) offer to the
holders of Registrable Securities in such notice the opportunity to
register the sale of such number of shares of Registrable Securities as such
holders may request in writing within five (5) days following receipt of
such notice (a " _Piggy-Back Registration_ "). The Company shall cause such
Registrable Securities to be included in such registration and shall use its
best efforts to cause the managing Underwriter or Underwriters of a proposed
underwritten offering to permit the Registrable Securities requested to be
included in a Piggy-Back Registration on the same terms and conditions as
any similar securities of the Company and to permit the sale or other
disposition of such Registrable Securities in accordance with the intended
method(s) of distribution thereof. All holders of Registrable Securities
proposing to distribute their securities through a Piggy-Back Registration
that involves an Underwriter or Underwriters shall enter into an underwriting
agreement in customary form with the Underwriter or Underwriters selected
for such Piggy-Back Registration.

2.2.2  _Reduction_ _ of Offering_. If the managing Underwriter or
Underwriters for a Piggy- Back Registration that is to be an underwritten
offering advises the Company and the holders of Registrable Securities in
writing that the dollar amount or number of Ordinary Shares which the Company
desires to sell, taken together with the Registrable Securities as to which
registration has been requested under this Section 2.2 and the Ordinary
Shares, if any, as to which registration has been requested pursuant to the
written contractual piggy-back registration rights of other shareholders of
the Company, exceeds the Maximum Number of Shares, then the Company shall
include in any such registration:

  



  

(a) if the registration is undertaken for the Company's account: (A) first,
the Ordinary Shares or other securities that the Company desires to sell
that can be sold without exceeding the Maximum Number of Shares; (B) second,
to the extent that the Maximum Number of Shares has not been reached
under the foregoing clause (A), the Ordinary Shares or other securities, if
any, comprised of Registrable Securities, as to which registration has been
requested pursuant to the applicable written contractual piggy-
back registration rights of such security holders, Pro Rata, that can be
sold without exceeding the Maximum Number of Shares; and (C) third, to the
extent that the Maximum Number of Shares has not been reached under the
foregoing clauses (A) and (B), the Ordinary Shares or other securities for
the account of other persons that the Company is obligated to register
pursuant to written contractual piggy-back registration rights with such
persons and that can be sold without exceeding the Maximum Number of
Shares; and

  



  

(b) if the registration is a "demand" registration undertaken at the
demand of persons other than the holders of Registrable Securities, (A)
first, the Ordinary Shares or other securities for the account of the
demanding persons that can be sold without exceeding the Maximum Number
of Shares; (B) second, to the extent that the Maximum Number of Shares has
not been reached under the foregoing clause (A), the Ordinary Shares or other
securities that the Company desires to sell that can be sold without
exceeding the Maximum Number of Shares; (C) third, to the extent that the
Maximum Number of Shares has not been reached under the foregoing clauses
(A) and (B), collectively the Ordinary Shares or other securities comprised
of Registrable Securities, Pro Rata, as to which registration has been
requested pursuant to the terms hereof, that can be sold without exceeding
the Maximum Number of Shares; and (D) fourth, to the extent that the Maximum
Number of Shares has not been reached under the foregoing clauses (A), (B)
and (C), the Ordinary Shares or other securities for the account of other
persons that the Company is obligated to register pursuant to written
contractual arrangements with such persons, that can be sold
without exceeding the Maximum Number of Shares.

  



  

2.2.3  _Withdrawal_. Any holder of Registrable Securities may elect to
withdraw such holder's request for inclusion of Registrable Securities in
any Piggy-Back Registration by giving written notice to the Company of such
request to withdraw prior to the effectiveness of the Registration Statement
or, if later, prior to the pricing date of the applicable offering. The
Company (whether on its own determination or as the result of a withdrawal
by persons making a demand pursuant to written contractual obligations) may
withdraw a Registration Statement at any time prior to the effectiveness of
such Registration Statement. Notwithstanding any such withdrawal, the
Company shall pay all expenses incurred by the holders of
Registrable Securities in connection with such Piggy-Back Registration as
provided in Section 2.7.

---|---|---

2.3  _Registrations_ _  on Form S-3_. The holders of Registrable Securities
may, at any time and from time to time, request in writing that the Company
register the resale of any or all of such Registrable Securities on Form S-3
or Form F-3 (as applicable) or any similar short-form registration to the
extent available at such time, including, without limitation, an automatic
shelf registration available to well-known seasoned issuers (" _Form  S-3_").
Upon receipt of such written request, the Company will promptly give written
notice of the proposed registration to all other holders of
Registrable Securities, and, as soon as practicable thereafter, effect the
registration of all or such portion of such holder's or holders' Registrable
Securities as are specified in such request, together with all or
such portion of the Registrable Securities or other securities of the
Company, if any, of any other holder or holders joining in such request as
are specified in a written request given within fifteen (15) days after
receipt of such written notice from the Company. At any time that a Form S-3
is effective, if Olayan delivers a notice to the Company stating that it
intends to effect an underwritten offering or distribution of all or part of
its Registrable Securities included by it on any Form S-3 (a " _Shelf
Offering_ "), then the Company shall amend or supplement the Form S-3 as
may be necessary in order to enable such Registrable Securities to be
distributed pursuant to the Shelf Offering. If the managing Underwriter or
Underwriters for a Shelf Offering that is to be an underwritten offering
advises the Company and the selling holders of Registrable Securities in
writing that the dollar amount or number of shares of Registrable Securities
which the selling holders desire to sell, taken together with all other
Ordinary Shares or other securities which the Company desires to sell and the
Ordinary Shares, if any, as to which registration has been
requested pursuant to written contractual piggy-back registration rights held
by other shareholders of the Company who desire to sell, exceeds the Maximum
Number of Shares, then the Company shall include shares in such
registration in the manner provided for in Section 2.1.4. The Company shall
not be obligated to effect any Shelf Offering or registration pursuant to
this Section 2.3: (i) if Form S-3 is not available for such offering; or
(ii) if the holders of the Registrable Securities, together with the holders
of any other securities of the Company entitled to inclusion in such
registration, propose to sell Registrable Securities and such other
securities (if any) at any aggregate price to the public of less than
$500,000. Registrations effected pursuant to this Section 2.3 shall not be
counted as Demand Registrations effected pursuant to Section 2.1.

  



  

2.4  _Resale Shelf Registration_.

  



  

2.4.1  _Filing_. As promptly as practicable following the NESR
Closing Date, but in any event within four (4) months following the
NESR Closing Date (the " _Filing Date_ "), the Company shall file with the
Commission a Shelf Registration Statement relating to the offer and sale of
all Registrable Securities owned by Olayan (the " _Resale Shelf Registration
Statement_ "). If any Resale Shelf Registration Statement is filed before
the time that is thirty (30) days after the NESR Closing Date, then Company
shall cause to be registered the Registrable Securities in such Resale
Shelf Registration Statement.

  



    

| 8| 
---|---|--- 

 


--- 

    



  

2.4.2  _Continued Effectiveness_. The Company shall use its
commercially reasonable efforts to have the Resale Shelf Registration
Statement declared effective as soon as practicable after the filing thereof,
but in no event later than thirty (30) days after the Filing Date (or one
hundred twenty (120) days after the Filing Date if the Commission
notifies the Company that it will "review" the Resale Shelf Registration
Statement). The Company shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to
maintain the effectiveness of the Resale Shelf Registration Statement or any
Subsequent Shelf Registration (as defined below) until such time as all
Registrable Securities have been sold pursuant to the Resale Shelf
Registration Statement or a Subsequent Shelf Registration (but in no event
for a shorter period than the applicable period referred to in Section
4(a)(3) of the Securities Act and Rule 174 thereunder) (such required
period(s) of effectiveness, collectively, the " _Resale Shelf Period_ ").
Subject to Section 2.6, the Company shall not be deemed to have used
commercially reasonable efforts to keep the Resale Shelf Registration
Statement effective during the Resale Shelf Period if the
Company voluntarily takes any action or omits to take any action that would
result in the holders of Registrable Securities covered thereby not being
able to offer and sell any Registrable Securities pursuant to such Resale
Shelf Registration Statement during the Resale Shelf Period, unless such
action or omission is required by applicable law. The filing of the Resale
Registration Statement and offers and sales thereunder shall not be deemed to
be a Demand Registration pursuant to this Registration Rights Agreement. The
holders of Registrable Securities shall be eligible to sell their
Registrable Securities pursuant to such Resale Registration Statement from
time to time on one or more occasions, including, without limitation, through
one or more underwritten offerings.

  



  

2.4.3  _Subsequent Shelf Registration_. If any Shelf Registration Statement
ceases to be effective under the Securities Act for any reason at any time
during the Resale Shelf Period, the Company shall use its reasonable best
efforts as promptly as is reasonably practicable to cause such Shelf
Registration Statement to again become effective under the Securities Act
(including obtaining the prompt withdrawal of any order suspending the
effectiveness of such Shelf Registration Statement), and shall use its
reasonable best efforts as promptly as is reasonably practicable to
amend such Shelf Registration Statement in a manner reasonably expected to
result in the withdrawal of any order suspending the effectiveness of such
Shelf Registration Statement or file an additional registration statement (a
" _Subsequent Shelf Registration_ ") for an offering to be made on a delayed
or continuous basis pursuant to Rule 415 of the Securities Act registering
the resale from time to time by the holders thereof of all securities that
are Registrable Securities as of the time of such filing. If a Subsequent
Shelf Registration is filed, the Company shall use its reasonable best
efforts to (x) cause such Subsequent Shelf Registration to become effective
under the Securities Act as promptly as is reasonably practicable after the
filing thereof and (y) keep such Subsequent Shelf Registration continuously
effective and usable until the end of the Resale Shelf Period. Any such
Subsequent Shelf Registration shall be a registration statement on Form S-3
or Form F-3 to the extent that the Company is eligible to use such form.
Otherwise, such Subsequent Shelf Registration shall be on another appropriate
form and shall provide for the registration of such Registrable
Securities for resale by the holders in accordance with any reasonable
method of distribution elected by Olayan or for sale by the Company, as the
case may be.

  



  

2.4.4  _Partner Distribution_. Notwithstanding anything contained herein to
the contrary, the Company hereby agrees that (i) the Resale Shelf
Registration Statement and any Subsequent Shelf Registration shall contain
all language (including, without limitation, on the prospectus cover page,
the principal shareholder chart and the plan of distribution) as may
reasonably be requested by Olayan to allow for a distribution of Registrable
Securities to, and resale by, the direct and indirect affiliates, partners,
members, shareholders, directors, employees or consultants of Olayan (a "
_Partner Distribution_ ") and (ii) the Company shall, at the reasonable
request of Olayan to effect a Partner Distribution, file any prospectus
supplement or post- effective amendments and otherwise take any action
reasonably requested to include suchlanguage, if such language was not
included in the initial Registration Statement, or revise such language if
deemed reasonably necessary by Olayan to effect such Partner
Distribution (including the ability for the distributees to resell such
Registrable Securities), including naming in a prospectus supplement or post-
effective amendment all of the affiliates, partners, members, shareholders,
directors, employees or consultants of Olayan who receive securities in the
Partner Distribution so that they may resell the securities received.
Any Ordinary Shares distributed pursuant to a Partner Distribution shall
remain "Registrable Securities" until they are sold or transferred by the
recipients thereof.

2.4.5  _Block Trades_. Notwithstanding anything stated in this
Registration Rights Agreement to the contrary, in the event that Olayan
wishes to engage in an underwritten block trade or overnight bought deal (or
other similar registered offering), Olayan shall not be required to give more
than one (1) day's notice of the transaction to any other holder or the
Company, but shall endeavor to work with the Company, Olayan and the
applicable underwriters sufficiently in advance of the launch date of such
transaction in order to prepare the requisite documentation and prospectus
supplement necessary in order to implement such offering. For the avoidance
of doubt, the Initiating Holder with respect to such underwritten block
trade or overnight bought deal (or other similar registered offering) shall
determine the launch date for such transaction.

  



  

2.5  _Registration Procedures_.

  



  

2.5.1  _Filings; Information_. Whenever the Company is required to effect
the registration of any Registrable Securities pursuant to this Article 2,
the Company shall use its best efforts to effect the registration and sale
of such Registrable Securities in accordance with the intended method(s) of
distribution thereof as expeditiously as practicable, and in connection with
any such request:

  



  

(a)  _Filing Registration Statement_. The Company shall use its
best efforts to, as expeditiously as possible after receipt of a request

Registrable Securities included in any registration to be listed on such

from the Company of the happening of any event of the kind described in
Section 2.5.1(d)(iv), each holder of Registrable Securities included in any
registration shall immediately discontinue disposition of such Registrable
Securities pursuant to the Registration Statement covering such Registrable
Securities until such holder receives the supplemented or amended
prospectus contemplated by Section 2.5.1(d). In addition, in the case of a
resale registration pursuant to Section 2.3 or Section 2.4 hereof, in the
event that a holder of Registrable Securities is an insider subject to the
Company's insider trading compliance program, upon any suspension by the
Company pursuant to a written insider trading compliance program adopted by
the Company's Board of Directors of the ability of all "insiders" covered by
such program to transact in the Company's securities because of the
existence of material non-public information, then each such insider shall
immediately discontinue disposition of such Registrable Securities pursuant
to the Registration Statement covering such Registrable Securities until the
restriction on the ability of "insiders" to transact in the Company's
securities is removed. In either case, if so directed by the Company, each
such holder will deliver to the Company all copies, other than permanent file

in performing or complying with its other obligations under this
Registration Rights Agreement, whether or not the Registration Statement
becomes effective, including, without limitation: (i) all registration and
filing fees; (ii) fees and expenses of compliance with securities or "blue
sky" laws (including fees and disbursements of counsel in connection with
blue sky qualifications of the Registrable Securities); (iii) printing

limitation, all salaries and expenses of its officers and employees); (v) the

reasonable fees and expenses of any special experts retained by the Company
in connection with such registration; and (ix) the reasonable fees and
expenses of one (1) legal counsel for Olayan in connection with any such
registration or offering (together with any local counsel). The Company
shall have no obligation to pay any underwriting fees, including discounts
or selling commissions, attributable to the Registrable Securities being sold
by the holders thereof, which underwriting fees shall be borne by such
holders. The holders shall not be required to pay any other costs or
expenses in connection with any registration or offering made pursuant to
this Registration Rights Agreement, other than their _pro rata_ portion of
underwriting discounts or selling commissions and any fees and expenses of
legal counsel not otherwise paid by the Company pursuant to this Section
2.7.

Registration Statement, including amendments and supplements thereto, in

Securities Act pursuant to Article 2 and in connection with the Company's
obligation to comply with federal and applicable state securities laws;
__provided__ , __however__ , that under no circumstances will the Company be
permitted to file any Registration Statement, amendment or supplement
incorporating any information or affidavits supplied by any holder of
Registrable Securities or using the holder's name (collectively, the "
_Holder Information_") unless (i) such Holder Information is incorporated
verbatim as supplied by the holder (or in the case of the holder's name,
incorporated exactly and only in the context consented to by the holder (the

ARTICLE 3

  

INDEMNIFICATION AND CONTRIBUTION

  



  

3.1  _Indemnification_ _  by the Company_. The Company agrees to indemnify
and hold harmless Olayan and each other holder of Registrable Securities, and
each of their respective officers, employees, affiliates, directors,
partners, members, attorneys and agents, and each person, if any, who
controls Olayan and each other holder of Registrable Securities (within the
meaning of Section 15 of the Securities Act or Section 20 of the Exchange
Act) and each of their respective officers, employees, affiliates, directors,
partners, members, attorneys and agents (each, an " _Investor Indemnified
Party_ "), from and against any expenses, losses, judgments, claims, damages
or liabilities, whether joint or several, arising out of or based upon any
untrue statement (or allegedly untrue statement) of a material fact
contained in any Registration Statement under which the sale of such
Registrable Securities was registered under the Securities Act, any
preliminary prospectus, final prospectus or summary prospectus contained in
the Registration Statement, or any amendment or supplement to such
Registration Statement, any free writing prospectus or any written or oral
materials distributed to or presented to investors at any roadshow or
other meetings with investors, or arising out of or based upon any omission
(or alleged omission) to state a material fact required to be stated therein
or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, or any violation
by the Company of the Securities Act applicable to the Company and relating
to any action or inaction required of the Company in connection with any such
registration; and the Company shall promptly reimburse the
Investor Indemnified Party for any legal and any other expenses reasonably
incurred by such Investor Indemnified Party in connection with investigating
and defending any such expense, loss, judgment, claim, damage, liability or
action as they are incurred; __provided__ , __however__ , that the Company
will not be liable in any such case to the extent that any such
expense, loss, claim, damage or liability arises out of or is based upon any
untrue statement or allegedly untrue statement or omission or
alleged omission made in such Registration Statement, preliminary
prospectus, final prospectus or summary prospectus, or any such amendment or
supplement, free writing prospectus or roadshow, in reliance upon and in
conformity with information furnished to the Company, in writing, by
such selling holder expressly for use therein.

  



    

| 15| 
---|---|--- 

 


--- 

    



  

3.2  _Indemnification_ _  by Holders of Registrable Securities_. Each
selling holder of Registrable Securities will, in the event that any
registration is being effected under the Securities Act pursuant to this
Registration Rights Agreement of any Registrable Securities held by such
selling holder, indemnify and hold harmless the Company, each of its
directors and officers, each person, if any, who controls the Company within
the meaning of the Securities Act and each Underwriter (if any), and each
other selling holder and each other person, if any, who controls another
selling holder or such Underwriter within the meaning of the Securities Act,
against any losses, claims, judgments, damages or liabilities, whether joint
or several, insofar as such losses, claims, judgments, damages or liabilities
(or actions in respect thereof) arise out of or are based upon any untrue
statement or allegedly untrue statement of a material fact containedin any
Registration Statement under which the sale of such Registrable Securities
was registered under the Securities Act, any preliminary prospectus, final
prospectus or summary prospectus contained in the Registration Statement, or
any amendment or supplement to the Registration Statement, or any free
writing prospectus or any written or oral material distributed or presented
to investors at any roadshow or other meetings with investors, or arise out
of or are based upon any omission or the alleged omission to state a
material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the
statement therein not misleading, if the statement or omission was made in
reliance upon and in conformity with information furnished in writing to the
Company by such selling holder expressly for use therein, and shall
reimburse the Company, its directors and officers, and each other selling
holder or controlling person for any legal or other expenses reasonably
incurred by any of them in connection with investigating or defending any
such loss, claim, damage, liability or action. Each selling holder's
indemnification obligations hereunder shall be several and not joint and
shall be limited to the amount of any net proceeds actually received by
such selling holder. The parties hereto agree that the only
information furnished in writing to the Company by any selling holder shall
be information about the number of shares owned by such holder included in
the Registration Statement or prospectus, or any amendment or supplement
thereto, in the selling stockholder table.

  



  

3.3  _Conduct_ _  of Indemnification Proceedings_. Promptly after receipt
by any person of any notice of any loss, claim, damage or liability or any
action in respect of which indemnity may be sought pursuant to Section 3.1
or Section 3.2, such person (the " _Indemnified Party_ ") shall, if a claim
in respect thereof is to be made against any other person for
indemnification hereunder, notify such other person (the " _Indemnifying
Party_ ") in writing of the loss, claim, judgment, damage, liability or
action; __provided__ ,  _ _however__ , that the failure by the Indemnified
Party to notify the Indemnifying Party shall not relieve the
Indemnifying Party from any liability which the Indemnifying Party may
have to such Indemnified Party hereunder, except and solely to the extent
the Indemnifying Party is actually prejudiced by such failure. If the
Indemnified Party is seeking indemnification with respect to any claim or
action brought against the Indemnified Party, then the Indemnifying Party
shall be entitled to participate in such claim or action, and, to the
extent that it wishes, jointly with all other Indemnifying Parties, to
assume control of the defense thereof with counsel satisfactory to the
Indemnified Party. After notice from the Indemnifying Party to the
Indemnified Party of its election to assume control of the defense of
such claim or action, the Indemnifying Party shall not be liable to the
Indemnified Party for any legal or other expenses subsequently incurred by
the Indemnified Party in connection with the defense thereof other
than reasonable costs of investigation; __provided__ , __however__ , that in
any action, the Indemnified Party shall have the right to employ separate
counsel (but no more than one such separate counsel) to represent the
Indemnified Party and its controlling persons who may be subject to
liability arising out of any claim in respect of which indemnity may be
sought by the Indemnified Party against the Indemnifying Party, with the
fees and expenses of such counsel to be paid by such Indemnifying Party if,
based upon the written opinion of counsel of such Indemnified Party,
representation of both parties by the same counsel would be
inappropriate due to actual or potential differing interests between them or
because the Indemnified Party and Indemnifying Parties may have different or
conflicting defenses in any such action. No Indemnifying Party shall,
without the prior written consent of the Indemnified Party, consent to entry
of judgment or effect any settlement of any claim or pending or threatened
proceeding in respect of which the Indemnified Party is or could have been a
party and indemnity could have been sought hereunder by such Indemnified
Party, unless such judgment or settlement includes an unconditional release
of such Indemnified Party from all liability arising out of such claim or
proceeding and does not include a statement as to or an admission of
fault, culpability or a failure to act by or on behalf of an Indemnified
Party.

3.4  _Contribution_.

  



  

3.4.1 If the indemnification provided for in the foregoing Section 3.1,
Section 3.2 and Section 3.3 is unavailable to any Indemnified Party in
respect of or insufficient to cover any loss, claim, damage, liability or
action referred to herein, then each such Indemnifying Party, in lieu of
indemnifying such Indemnified Party, shall contribute to the amount paid or
payable by such Indemnified Party as a result of such loss, claim,
damage, liability or action in such proportion as is appropriate to
reflect the relative fault of the Indemnified Parties and the Indemnifying
Parties in connection with the actions or omissions which resulted in
such loss, claim, damage, liability or action, as well as any other relevant
equitable considerations. The relative fault of any Indemnified Party and
any Indemnifying Party shall be determined by reference to, among other
things, whether the untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or
the omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to
information supplied by such Indemnified Party or such Indemnifying Party
and the parties' relative intent, knowledge, access to information and
opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission.

  



  

3.4.2 The parties hereto agree that it would not be just and equitable if
contribution pursuant to this Section 3.4 were determined by _pro rata _
allocation or by any other method of allocation which does not take account
of the equitable considerations referred to in the immediately preceding
Section 3.4.1.

  



  

3.4.3 The amount paid or payable by an Indemnified Party as a result of
any loss, claim, damage, liability or action referred to in the
immediately preceding paragraph shall be deemed to include, subject to the
limitations set forth above, any legal or other expenses incurred by such
Indemnified Party in connection with investigating or defending any such
action or claim. Notwithstanding the provisions of this Article 3, no
holder of Registrable Securities shall be required to pay any amount in
respect of indemnification and/or contribution in excess of the dollar
amount of the net proceeds (after payment of any underwriting
fees, discounts, commissions or taxes) actually received by such holder from
the sale of Registrable Securities which gave rise to such indemnification
and/or contribution obligation. No person guilty of fraudulent
misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the
Securities Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was
not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation. In addition, no holder of
Registrable Securities or any affiliate thereof shall be required to pay any
amount as contribution, unless such person or entity would have been
required to pay such amount pursuant to Section 3.2, if it had been
applicable in accordance with its terms.

  



  

3.4.4 The indemnity and contribution agreements contained herein shall be
in addition to any other rights to indemnification or contribution which any
Indemnified Party may have pursuant to law or contract and shall remain
operative and in full force and effect regardless of any investigation made
or omitted by or on behalf of any Indemnified Party and shall survive the
transfer of the Registrable Securities by any such Party. The
indemnification and contribution required by this Registration Rights
Agreement shall be made by periodic payments of the amount thereof during the
course of the investigation or defense, as and when bills are received or
expense, loss, damage or liability is incurred.

ARTICLE 4

  

RULE 144

  



  

4.1  _Rule_ _ 144_. The Company covenants that it shall file any reports
required to be filed by it under the Securities Act and the Exchange Act and
shall take such further action as the holders of Registrable Securities may
reasonably request, all to the extent required from time to time to enable
such holders to sell Registrable Securities without registration under the
Securities Act within the limitation of the exemptions provided by Rule 144
under the Securities Act, as such Rule may be amended from time to time, or
any similar rule or regulation hereafter adopted by the Commission. To the
extent any holder desires to sell Registrable Securities pursuant to Rule
144, the Company agrees to provide customary instructions to the
transfer agent to remove any restrictive legends from such securities and to
provide or cause any customary opinions of counsel to be delivered to the
transfer agent in connection with any such sale. In addition, the Company
agrees to remove any restrictive legend from the Registrable Securities
upon the reasonable request of any holder as soon as reasonably
permitted by applicable law and customary practice (including customary
transfer agent practices).

has the right to waive; __provided__ ,  _ _however__ , that such waiver will
not be effective against the waiving Party unless it is in writing, is
signed by such Party, and specifically refers to this Registration Rights
Agreement. Waivers may be made in advance or after the right waived
has arisen or the breach or default waived has occurred. Any waiver may be
conditional. No waiver of any breach of any agreement or provision herein
contained shall be deemed a waiver of any preceding or succeeding breach
thereof nor of any other agreement or provision herein contained. No
waiver or extension of time for performance of any obligations or acts shall
be deemed a waiver or extension of the time for performance of any other
obligations or acts.

  



  

5.9  _Remedies Cumulative_. In the event that the Company fails to
observe or perform any covenant or agreement to be observed or performed
under this Registration Rights Agreement, Olayan or any other holder of
Registrable Securities may proceed to protect and enforce its rights by suit
in equity or action at law, whether for specific performance of any term
contained in this Registration Rights Agreement or for an injunction against
the breach of any such term or in aid of the exercise of any power
granted in this Registration Rights Agreement or to enforce any other legal
or equitable right, or to take any one or more of such actions, without
being required to post a bond. None of the rights, powers or remedies
conferred under this Registration Rights Agreement shall be mutually
exclusive, and each such right, power or remedy shall be cumulative and in
addition to any other right, power or remedy, whether conferred by this
Registration Rights Agreement or now or hereafter available at law, in
equity, by statute or otherwise.

  



  

5.10  _Governing_ _  Law_. This Registration Rights Agreement shall be
governed by, interpreted under, and construed in accordance with the
internal laws of the State of New York applicable to agreements made and to

5.11  _Waiver_ _  of Trial by Jury_. Each Party hereby irrevocably and
unconditionally waives the right to a trial by jury in any action, suit,
counterclaim or other proceeding (whether based on contract, tort or
otherwise) arising out of, connected with or relating to this Registration
Rights Agreement, the transactions contemplated hereby, or the actions of
Olayan in the negotiation, administration, performance or
enforcement hereof.

  



  

5.12  _Further Assurances_. Each Party hereto shall do and perform or cause
to be done and performed all such further acts and things and shall execute

5.13  _Restructuring_. To the extent that the board of directors or other
governing authority of the Company elects to effect a restructuring
or recapitalization of the Company or substantially all of the business of
the Company through a subsidiary or parent company of the Company or
otherwise, the provisions of this Registration Rights Agreement shall be
appropriately adjusted, and the holders of Registrable Securities and the
Company shall enter into such further agreements and arrangements as shall be
reasonably necessary or appropriate to provide the holders of
Registrable Securities with substantially the same registration rights as
they would have under this Registration Rights Agreement, giving due
consideration to the nature of the new public entity, the nature of the
securities to be offered and tax and other relevant considerations. The
Company agrees that it shall not effect or permit to occur any combination
or subdivision of its capital stock which would adversely affect the ability
of any holder of any Registrable Securities to include such Registrable
Securities in any registration contemplated by this Registration Rights
Agreement or the marketability of such Registrable Securities in any such
registration. The provisions of this Registration Rights Agreement shall
apply, to the full extent set forth herein with respect to the Registrable
Securities, to any and all shares of capital stock of the Company, any
successor or assign of the Company (whether by merger, share exchange,
consolidation, sale of assets or otherwise) or any subsidiary or parent
company of the Company which may be issued in respect of, in exchange for or
in substitution of Registrable Securities and shall be appropriately adjusted
for any stock dividends, splits, reverse splits, combinations,
recapitalizations and the like occurring after the date hereof.
