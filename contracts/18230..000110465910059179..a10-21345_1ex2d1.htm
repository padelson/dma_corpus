 _provided_ , _however_ , that if all the conditions set forth in Article VI

the extent permitted by law) waived. The date on which the Closing occurs
is referred to in this Agreement as the " _Closing Date_ ". For purposes
of this Agreement, the term " _business day_ " shall mean any day ending

on which banks are required or authorized to close in the City of Chicago,

DGCL. The Merger shall become effective at such date and time as the
Certificate of Merger is duly filed with the Secretary of State of the State
of Delaware or at such subsequent date and time as Parent and the Company
shall agree and specify in the Certificate of Merger. The date and time at
which the Merger becomes effective is referred to in this Agreement as the "
_Effective Time_ ".

  



  

SECTION 1.04. _Effects of the Merger_. The Merger shall have the effects set

the earlier of their resignation or removal or until their respective

SECTION 1.07. _Officers_. The officers of the Company immediately prior to
the Effective Time shall be the officers of the Surviving Corporation
until the earlier of their resignation or removal or until their

ARTICLE II

  



  

 _Conversion of Securities_

  



  

SECTION 2.01. _Conversion of Capital Stock_. At the Effective Time, by virtue
of the Merger and without any action on the part of the holder of any shares
of Common Stock, par value $0.01 per share, of the Company (the " _Company
Common Stock_ "), or the holder of any shares of capital stock of Sub:

  



  

(a) _Capital Stock of Sub_. Each issued and outstanding share of common
stock of Sub, par value $0.01 per share, shall be converted into and become
one fully paid and nonassessable share of common stock, par value $0.01 per
share, of the Surviving Corporation.

  



  

(b) _Cancelation of Treasury Stock and Parent-Owned Stock_.  All shares of
Company Common Stock that are owned as treasury stock by the Company or owned
by Parent or Sub, or any other direct or indirect wholly-owned Subsidiary of
Parent, immediately prior to the Effective Time shall automatically be
canceled and shall cease to exist, and no consideration shall be delivered or
deliverable in exchange therefore.

  



  

(c) _Conversion of Company Common Stock_. Subject to the allocation and
election procedures in Section 2.03, each share of Company Common Stock
issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than
shares to be canceled in accordance with Section 2.01(b) and, except as
provided in Section 2.02, the Appraisal Shares, together, the "
_Excluded Shares_ "), **** shall be converted into the right to receive
$92.00 in cash, without interest (the " _Merger Consideration_ "). At the
Effective Time, such shares shall no longer be outstanding and shall
automatically be canceled and shall cease to exist, and each holder of a
certificate or evidence of shares in book-entry form that immediately prior
to the Effective Time represented any such shares (a " _Certificate_ ") shall
cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except the right to receive
the Merger Consideration in accordance with the terms of this Agreement.

  



  

SECTION 2.02. _Appraisal Rights_. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement
to the contrary, shares (the " _Appraisal Shares_ ") of Company Common
Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time that are
held by any holder who is entitled to demand and properly demands appraisal
of such shares pursuant to, and who complies in all respects with, the
provisions of Section 262 of the DGCL (" _Section 262_") shall not be
converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration as provided in
Section 2.01(c), but instead such holder shall be entitled to payment of the
fair value of such shares in accordance with the provisions of Section 262.
At the Effective Time, the Appraisal Shares shall no longer be outstanding
and shall automatically be canceled and shall cease to exist, and each holder
of a certificate or evidence of shares in book-entry form that immediately
prior to the Effective Time represented Appraisal Shares shall cease to have
any rights with respect thereto, except the right to receive the fair value
of such shares in accordance with the provisions of

  



        
   

  



  

Section 262. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if any such holder shall fail to
perfect or otherwise shall waive, withdraw or lose the right to appraisal
under Section 262 or a court of competent jurisdiction shall determine that
such holder is not entitled to the relief provided by Section 262, then the
right of such holder to be paid the fair value of such holders Appraisal
Shares under Section 262 shall cease and such Appraisal Shares shall be
deemed to have been converted as of the Effective Time into, and shall have
become, the right to receive the Merger Consideration as provided in Section
2.01(c). The Company shall serve prompt notice to Parent of any demands for
appraisal of any shares of Company Common Stock, withdrawals of any such
demands and any other related instruments served pursuant to the DGCL
received by the Company, and Parent shall have the right to participate in
and direct all negotiations and proceedings with respect to such demands.
 The Company shall not, without the prior written consent of Parent,
make any payment with respect to, or settle or offer to settle, any such
demands, or agree to do or commit to do any of the foregoing.

  



  

SECTION 2.03. _Exchange of Certificates_.

  



  

(a) _Paying Agent_. Prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall designate a
bank or trust company reasonably acceptable to the Company to act as agent
for the payment of the Merger Consideration upon surrender of Certificates
(the " _Paying Agent_ "), and, from time to time after the Effective Time,
Parent shall make available, or cause the Surviving Corporation to make
available, to the Paying Agent in trust for the benefit of holders of shares
of Company Common Stock immediately available funds sufficient to pay the
aggregate Merger Consideration (such cash being hereinafter referred to
as the " _Exchange Fund_ ") in exchange for outstanding shares of
Company Common Stock.

  



  

(b) _Exchange Procedure_. As soon as reasonably practicable after the
Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation or Parent shall cause the Paying
Agent to mail to each holder of record of a Certificate (i) a form of letter
of transmittal (which shall include an accompanying IRS Form W-9 (or
substitute IRS Form W-9) and IRS Form W-8BEN, shall specify that delivery
shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the Certificates held by
such person shall pass, only upon proper delivery of the Certificates to the
Paying Agent and shall be in a form and have such other provisions (including
customary provisions regarding delivery of an "agents message" with respect
to shares held in book-entry form) as Parent may reasonably specify) and (ii)
instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the Certificates in
exchange for the Merger Consideration. Upon surrender of a Certificate
for cancelation to the Paying Agent or to such other agent or agents as may
be appointed by Parent, together with such letter of transmittal, duly
completed and validly executed, and such other documents as may reasonably be
required by the Paying Agent, the holder of such Certificate shall be
entitled to receive in exchange therefor the amount of cash equal to the
Merger Consideration that such holder has the right to receive pursuant to
Section 2.01(c), and the Certificate so surrendered shall forthwith be
canceled. In the event of a transfer of ownership of Company

  



        
   

  



  

Common Stock that is not registered in the stock transfer books of the
Company, payment of the Merger Consideration in exchange therefor may be made
to a person other than the person in whose name the Certificate so
surrendered is registered if such Certificate shall be properly endorsed or
otherwise be in proper form for transfer and the person requesting such
payment shall pay any transfer or other taxes required by reason of
the payment to a person other than the registered holder of such Certificate
or establish to the satisfaction of the Surviving Corporation that such tax
has been paid or is not applicable. No interest shall be paid or shall
accrue on the cash payable upon surrender of any Certificate.

  



  

(c) _No Further Ownership Rights in Company Common Stock_.  All Merger
Consideration paid upon the surrender of a Certificate in accordance with the
terms of this Article II shall be deemed to have been paid in full
satisfaction of all rights pertaining to the shares of Company Common Stock
formerly represented by such Certificate. At the close of business on the day
on which the Effective Time occurs, the stock transfer books of the Company
shall be closed, and there shall be no further registration of transfers on
the stock transfer books of the Surviving Corporation of the shares that were
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time.  If, after the close of
business on the day on which the Effective Time occurs, Certificates are
presented to the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent for transfer or
any other reason, they shall be canceled and exchanged as provided in this
Article II.

  



  

(d) _Lost Certificates_. If any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen,
defaced or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the
person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen, defaced or destroyed
and, if required by the Surviving Corporation, the posting by such person of
a bond in such amount as the Surviving Corporation may direct as indemnity
against any claim that may be made against it with respect to such
Certificate, the Paying Agent or the Surviving Corporation, as the case may
be, shall pay the Merger Consideration in respect of such lost, stolen,
defaced or destroyed Certificate.

  



  

(e) _Withholding Rights_. Parent, the Surviving Corporation or the Paying
Agent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the Merger Consideration
otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement to any holder of shares of
Company Common Stock such amounts, but only such amounts, as required to be
deducted and withheld with respect to the making of such payment under the
Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the " _Code_ "), or any provision
of state, local or foreign tax Law. To the extent that amounts are so
withheld and paid over to the appropriate taxing authority by Parent, the
Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent, such withheld amounts shall be
treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the holder
of the shares of Company Common Stock in respect of which such deduction and
withholding was made by Parent, the Surviving Corporation or the Paying
Agent.

  



        
   

  



  

(f) _Termination of Exchange Fund_. At any time following the one-year
anniversary of the Closing Date, the Surviving Corporation shall be entitled
to require the Paying Agent to deliver to it any cash (including any interest
received with respect thereto) that are held in the Exchange Fund and that
have not been disbursed to holders of Certificates, and thereafter, such
holders shall be entitled to look only to Parent and the Surviving
Corporation (subject to abandoned property, escheat or other similar Laws) as
general creditors thereof with respect to the payment of any
Merger Consideration that may be payable upon surrender of any Certificates
held by such holders, as determined pursuant to this Agreement, without any
interest thereon. Notwithstanding the foregoing, none of Parent, Sub, the
Company, the Surviving Corporation, the Paying Agent or any other Person
shall be liable to any person in respect of any Merger Consideration that
would have otherwise have been payable in respect of any Certificate which is
delivered to a public official as required by applicable abandoned
property, escheat or similar Laws.

  



  

(g) _Investment of Exchange Fund_. The Paying Agent shall invest any cash
included in the Exchange Fund as directed by Parent, on a daily basis,
_provided_ that (i) no such investment or losses thereon shall affect the
amount of Merger Consideration payable to the holders of shares of Company
Common Stock and (ii) such investments shall be in short-term obligations of
or guaranteed by the United States of America with maturities of no more than
30 days, or in commercial paper obligations rated A-1 or P-1 or better by
Moodys Investor Services, Inc. or Standard and Poors Corporation,
respectively. The Exchange Fund shall not be used for any other purpose,
except as provided in this Agreement. Any interest and other income resulting
from such investments will be paid to Parent.

SECTION 3.01. _Representations and Warranties of the Company_. Except as set
forth in the SEC Documents filed or furnished and publicly available prior to

disclosures in the "Risk Factors" sections of the Filed SEC Documents or any
disclosures included in the Filed SEC Documents that are cautionary,
predictive or forward-looking in nature; _provided_ , that any matter set
forth in the Filed SEC Documents shall be deemed to qualify any
representation or warranty in this Section 3.01 to the extent that the manner
in which it would qualify a representation or warranty is reasonably
apparent) or in the applicable section of the letter delivered by the Company
to Parent in connection with the execution of this Agreement (the " _Company

organizational power and authority to carry on its business as

and is in good standing in each jurisdiction (except, in the case of good

nature of its business or the ownership, leasing or operation of its
properties makes such qualification or licensing necessary, other than where
the failure to be so organized, existing, qualified or licensed or in good
standing would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be likely to
have a Company Material Adverse Effect. The Company has made available to
Parent true and complete copies of the certificate of incorporation of the
Company, as amended to the date of this Agreement (the "
_Company Certificate_ "), and the bylaws of the Company, as amended to the
date of this Agreement (the " _Company Bylaws_ "), and the certificate

Stock on the applicable grant date. All outstanding Company SARs are evidenced
by individual written stock appreciation rights agreements in each
case substantially identical to one of the forms set forth in Section

its obligations under this Agreement do not and will not conflict with, or
result in any violation or breach of, or default (with or without notice or

Material Adverse Effect. No consent, approval, order or authorization of,
registration, declaration or filing with, or notice to, any Federal, state or
local, domestic or foreign, government or any court, administrative agency or

material amendments thereto. Each Specified Contract of the Company or any
of its Subsidiaries that is material to the result of operation or financial
condition of the Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole (a "
_Material Contract_ ") is in full force and effect (except for those
Contracts that have expired in accordance with their terms) and is a legal,
valid and binding agreement of the Company or such Subsidiary, as the case

lease or operate their properties and assets and to carry on their businesses

Company Material Adverse Effect. Each of the Company and its Subsidiaries
is, and since January 1, 2009 has been, in compliance with all applicable
Laws and Judgments, and no condition or state of facts exists that could
reasonably be expected to give rise to a violation of, or a liability or
default under, any such applicable Law or Judgment, except for such
noncompliance or such condition or state of facts that would, individually or
in the aggregate, not reasonably be likely to have a Company Material Adverse
Effect. The execution and delivery of this Agreement by the Company does not,
and the consummation of the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by
this Agreement and compliance with the terms hereof could not reasonably be
expected to, cause the revocation or cancelation of any Permit, except for

aggregate, reasonably be likely to have a Company Material Adverse Effect.
Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has received any written
communication from any Governmental Entity that alleges that the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries is not in compliance in all material respects with,
or is subject to material liability under, any Permit, Law or Judgment or
relating to the revocation or modification of any material Permit. Neither
the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has received any written notice that

agreement or any Benefit Plan or Benefit Agreement (or any arrangement that
would be a Benefit Plan or Benefit Arrangement if it had been adopted,
entered into or established prior to the date hereof) that would materially
increase the cost to the Company or any of its Commonly Controlled Entities
with respect to such Benefit Plan, Benefit Agreement or collective bargaining
agreement, or (B) has made any change in any actuarial or other assumption
used to calculate funding obligations with respect to any Pension Plan or any
change in the manner in which contributions to any Pension Plan are made or
the basis on which such contributions are determined that, in either case,
would materially increase the cost of any such Pension Plan. Since January 1,
2009, neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has encountered any

2009, has been, in compliance with all applicable Laws and Judgments relating
to labor relations, employment and employment practices, occupational safety
and health standards, terms and conditions of employment, payment of wages,
and immigration, other than any such noncompliance that is not reasonably
likely to have a Company Material Adverse Effect and there is no claim
pending, or to the knowledge of the Company, threatened that the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries is not, in any material respect, in compliance with
such applicable Laws and Judgments. There is no unfair labor practice charge
or complaint or claim regarding representation against the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries pending or, to the knowledge of the Company, threatened, in
each case before the National Labor Relations Board or any comparable
Governmental Entity.  No grievance or arbitration proceeding arising out of a
collective bargaining agreement is pending or, to the knowledge of the
Company, threatened against the Company or any of its Subsidiaries.

against any person whose liabilities for such Environmental Claims the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries has, or may have, retained or assumed,
either contractually or by operation of Law; (vii) neither the Company nor

are no agreements, written or oral, with respect to the provision of
welfare benefits, after termination of employment, except where the cost
thereof is borne entirely by the former employee (or his or her eligible
dependents or beneficiaries) or as required by Section 4980B(f) of the Code
or any similar state statute or foreign Law.  The Company and its
Subsidiaries have complied with the applicable requirements of Section

health plan" (as defined in Section 5000(b)(1) of the Code) or any similar

likely to subject to the Company or its Subsidiaries to liability for breach
of fiduciary duty under ERISA (or indemnification for breach of fiduciary
duty) in an amount that would, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably
be expected to have Company Material Adverse Effect.

  



  

(x)  Each Benefit Plan and each Benefit Agreement that is a "nonqualified
deferred compensation plan" within the meaning of Treas. Reg. Section

deficiency, refund litigation, proposed adjustment or matter in controversy
with respect to any material taxes due and owing by the Company, any of its
Subsidiaries or any Company Affiliated Group. Each material deficiency
resulting from any completed audit or examination or concluded litigation
relating to taxes by any taxing authority has been timely paid or is being
contested in good faith. The relevant statute of limitations is closed with

the Subsidiary does not file tax returns that the Company or the Subsidiary
is subject to taxation by that jurisdiction.

  



  

(vii)  Except as disclosed in Section 3.01(m)(vii) of the Company Letter,

shall be deemed to qualify any representation or warranty in this Section
3.02 only to the extent that it is reasonably apparent that the description
of such matter in the Parent SEC Documents would be a

  



         
 

  



  

qualification with respect to such representation or warranty), Parent and
Sub represent and warrant to the Company as follows:

  



  

(a) _Organization, Standing and Corporate Power_. Each of Parent and Sub
(i) is a corporation duly organized, validly existing and in good standing
under the Laws of the jurisdiction of its organization, (ii) has all
requisite corporate power and authority to carry on its business as currently
conducted and (iii) is duly qualified or licensed to do business and is in
good standing in each jurisdiction in which the nature of its business or the
ownership, leasing or operation of its properties makes such qualification or
licensing necessary, other than where the failure to be so organized,
existing, qualified or licensed or in good standing would not, individually
or in the aggregate, reasonably be likely to have a Parent Material Adverse
Effect. Parent has made available to the Company true and complete copies of
the certificate of incorporation of Parent, as amended to the date of this
Agreement, and the bylaws of Parent, as amended to the date of this
Agreement, and the certificate of incorporation and bylaws of Sub, as amended
to the date of this Agreement.

  



  

(b) _Authority; Noncontravention_. Each of Parent and Sub has the requisite

the sole stockholder of Sub). The execution and delivery of this Agreement
by Parent and Sub, the consummation by Parent and Sub of the Merger and the
other transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the performance by
Parent and Sub with its obligations under this Agreement have been duly

to authorize this Agreement, to comply with the terms of this Agreement or to
consummate the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement (subject, in the case of the Merger, to the adoption of
this Agreement by Parent, as the sole stockholder of Sub). This Agreement has
been duly executed and delivered by Parent and Sub, as applicable, and,
assuming the due execution and delivery of this Agreement by the Company,
constitutes a valid and binding obligation of Parent and Sub, as applicable,
enforceable against Parent and Sub, as applicable, in accordance with its
terms, subject to the Bankruptcy and Equity Exception. The execution and
delivery of this Agreement, the consummation of the Merger and the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the performance by Parent and
Sub with its obligations under this Agreement do not and will not conflict
with, or result in any violation or breach of, or default (with or without
notice or lapse of time or both) under, or give rise to a right of, or result
in, termination, cancelation or acceleration of any obligation or to a loss
of a material benefit under, or result in the creation of any Lien in or upon
any of the properties or assets of Parent or Sub or any of Parents
Subsidiaries under, or give rise to any increased, additional, accelerated or
guaranteed rights or entitlements under, any provision of (i) the certificate
of incorporation or bylaws of Parent or Sub (ii) any Contract or Permit to or
by

otherwise under which Parent or Sub has rights or benefits or (iii) subject
to the governmental filings and other matters referred to in the following
sentence, any Law (assuming receipt of the Stockholder Approval) or Judgment,
in each case, applicable to Parent or Sub or any of Parents Subsidiaries or
their respective properties or assets, other than, in the case of clauses
(ii) and (iii), any such conflicts, violations, breaches, defaults,
terminations, cancelations, accelerations, losses, Liens, rights or
entitlements that would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be

or authorization of, registration, declaration or filing with, or notice to,
any Governmental Entity is required by or with respect to Parent or Sub or
any of Parents Subsidiaries in connection with the execution and delivery of
this Agreement by Parent and Sub, the consummation by Parent and Sub of the
Merger or the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement or the
performance by Parent and Sub of their respective obligations under
this Agreement, except for (A) the filing of a premerger notification
and report form under the HSR Act and the filings and receipt, termination
or expiration, as applicable, of such other approvals or waiting periods
required under any other applicable competition, merger control, antitrust or
similar Law or foreign investment control or similar law, (B) the filing with
the SEC of the Proxy Statement, and such reports under the Exchange Act as
may be required in connection with this Agreement and the Merger and the

states in which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is qualified to do

York Stock Exchange, (E) any filings, notification and reports under
state securities, takeover and "blue sky" Laws, and (F) such other consents,

notices, the failure of which to be obtained or made, would not, individually

Effect. _Interim Operations of Sub_. Sub was formed solely for the purpose
of engaging in the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement and has engaged in no business other than in connection with the
Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

  



  

(c) _Litigation_.  There are no civil, criminal or administrative actions,
suits, claims, hearings, arbitrations, investigations or other proceedings
pending or, to the knowledge of Parent, threatened against Parent or any of
its Subsidiaries, except for those that would not, individually or in the
aggregate, reasonably be likely to prevent, substantially impede or
substantially delay the consummation by Parent and Sub of the Merger or the
other transactions contemplated by this Agreement. There is no Judgment of
any Governmental Entity or arbitrator outstanding against, or investigation,
proceeding, notice of violation, order of forfeiture or complaint by any
Governmental Entity involving, Parent or any of its Subsidiaries that,

substantially impede or substantially delay the

  



        
   

  



  

consummation by Parent and Sub of the Merger or the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement.

  



  

(d) _Permits; Compliance with Laws_. Parent and Sub have in effect all
Permits that are necessary for them to own, lease or operate their properties

substantially delay the consummation by Parent and Sub of the Merger or the
other transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Each of Parent and Sub is
in compliance with all applicable Laws and Judgments, and no condition or
state of facts exists that could reasonably be expected to give rise to a
material violation of, or a material liability or default under, any such
applicable Law or Judgment, except for such noncompliance or such condition
or state of facts that would not, individually or in the aggregate,
reasonably be likely to prevent, substantially impede or substantially delay
the consummation by Parent and Sub of the Merger or the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement.

  



  

(e) _Available Funds_. Parent has as of the date of this Agreement
committed financing with respect to all funds necessary to, and, at the
Effective Time, will have available to it all funds necessary to, satisfy all
of its obligations hereunder and in connection with the Merger.

SECTION 4.02. _No Solicitation_. (a) Notwithstanding any provision in this
Agreement to the contrary, the Company (i) shall not, nor shall it authorize
or permit any of its Subsidiaries to, nor shall it authorize or permit any
director, officer or employee of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to,
and (ii) shall direct any investment banker, attorney, accountant or other
advisor or representative of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries not to
and shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause any such investment
banker, attorney, accountant or other advisor or representative not to,
directly or indirectly (and it shall direct and cause each
applicable Subsidiary, if any, to direct each such director, officer,
employee, investment banker, attorney, accountant or other advisor or
representative of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries not to), (i)
solicit, initiate or knowingly encourage, or take any other action to
knowingly facilitate, any Takeover Proposal or any inquiries or the making of
any proposal that could reasonably be expected to lead to a Takeover Proposal
or (ii) enter into, continue or otherwise participate in any discussions or
negotiations regarding, or furnish to any person (or any representative
thereof) any information with respect to any Takeover Proposal; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that at any time prior to obtaining the Stockholder Approval, in
response to a bona fide written unsolicited Takeover Proposal that the Board
of Directors of the Company determines in good faith constitutes or is
reasonably likely to lead to a Superior Proposal, and which Takeover Proposal
did not result from a breach of this Section 4.02, the Company may, and may
permit and authorize its Subsidiaries and its representatives and its
Subsidiaries representatives to, (A) furnish information with respect to the
Company and its Subsidiaries to the person making such Takeover Proposal (and
its representatives) pursuant to a confidentiality agreement which contains
terms that are substantially similar to those contained in the
Confidentiality Agreement, dated as of September 24, 2010, between Parent and
the Company (as it may be amended from time to time, the " _Confidentiality
Agreement_ "), _provided_ that all such material written information
regarding the Company and its Subsidiaries had been provided, or is
substantially concurrently provided, to Parent and (B) participate in
discussions or negotiations with the person making such Takeover
Proposal (and its representatives) regarding such Takeover Proposal or
otherwise.

  



  

For purposes of this Agreement, the term " _Takeover Proposal_ " means
any inquiry, proposal or offer from any person or group (other than Parent or
Sub or any of their affiliates) relating to one transaction or a series
of transactions, any merger, consolidation, recapitalization, liquidation
or dissolution involving the Company or any direct or indirect
acquisition, including by way of any merger, consolidation, tender offer,
exchange offer, stock acquisition, asset acquisition, binding share exchange,
business combination, recapitalization, liquidation, dissolution, joint
venture, license agreement or similar transaction (a " _Business Combination_
"), of (i) assets or businesses that constitute or represent 15% or more of
the total consolidated assets of the Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a
whole, or (ii) 15% or more of the outstanding shares of Company Common Stock
or of any class of capital stock of, or other equity or voting interests in,
one or more of the Subsidiaries of the Company which, in the aggregate,
directly or

  



        
   

  



  

indirectly hold at least the amount of the assets equal to the amount
referred to in clause (i) above.

  



  

For purposes of this Agreement, the term " _Superior Proposal_ " means
any Takeover Proposal that did not result from a breach of Section 4.02(a)
made by any person (other than Parent or Sub or any of their affiliates)
that, if consummated, would result in such person (or, in the case of a
direct merger between such person and the Company, the stockholders of such
person) acquiring, directly or indirectly, more than 50% of the voting power
of the Company Common Stock or all or substantially all the assets of the
Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, and which offer, in the good
faith judgment of the Board of Directors of the Company (after consultation
with a financial advisor of nationally recognized reputation and outside
legal counsel), (i) is more favorable from a financial point of view than the
Merger (taking into account all of the terms and conditions of such proposal
and this Agreement (including any binding changes to the terms of this
Agreement proposed by Parent in response to such Superior Proposal or
otherwise)), (ii) is not subject to any closing condition providing for the
obtaining of financing, and (iii) is reasonably capable of being completed,
taking into account all financial, legal, regulatory and other aspects of
such proposal.

  



  

(b) Neither the Board of Directors of the Company nor any committee thereof
shall (or shall agree or resolve to) (i) withdraw or modify in a manner
adverse to Parent or Sub, or propose publicly to withdraw or modify in a
manner adverse to Parent or Sub, the recommendation of this Agreement or the
Merger, or recommend, declare advisable or propose to recommend or declare
advisable, the approval or adoption of any Takeover Proposal or resolve or
agree to take any such action (any such action, resolution or agreement to
take such action being referred to herein as an " _Adverse Recommendation
Change_ "), or (ii) cause or permit the Company to enter into any letter of
intent, memorandum of understanding, agreement in principle, acquisition
agreement, merger agreement, option agreement, joint venture agreement,
partnership agreement or other agreement (each, an " _Acquisition Agreement_
") for any Takeover Proposal (other than a confidentiality agreement referred
to in Section 4.02(a)), or resolve or agree to take any such action.
 Notwithstanding the foregoing, at any time prior to the
Stockholder Approval, the Board of Directors of the Company may, in response
to a Superior Proposal or an Intervening Event, effect an Adverse
Recommendation Change, _provided_  that the Board of Directors of the Company
determines in good faith, after consultation with its outside legal counsel
and, in the case of a Superior Proposal, a nationally recognized financial
advisor, that the failure to do so would be inconsistent with its fiduciary
duties under applicable Law, and _provided_   _further_ , that the Board of
Directors of the Company may not effect such an Adverse Recommendation Change
unless (A) the Board of Directors shall have first provided prior written
notice to Parent (an " _Adverse Recommendation Change Notice_ ") that it is
prepared to effect an Adverse Recommendation Change in response to a Superior
Proposal or an Intervening Event, which notice shall, in the case of a
Superior Proposal, attach the most current version of any written agreement
relating to the transaction that constitutes such Superior Proposal,

  



        
   

  



  

and, in the case of an Intervening Event, attach information which it
reasonably describes such Intervening Event in reasonable detail, and (B)
Parent does not make, within three business days after the receipt of such
notice, a proposal that would, in the good faith judgment of the Board of
Directors of the Company (after consultation with outside legal counsel and,
in the case of a Superior Proposal, a nationally recognized financial
advisor), (x) cause the offer previously constituting a Superior Proposal to
no longer constitute a Superior Proposal or (y) cause the Board of Directors
to conclude that it no longer needs to make an Adverse Recommendation Change
as a result of an Intervening Event (it being understood and agreed that any
binding amendment or modification of such Superior Proposal shall require a
new Adverse Recommendation Change Notice and a subsequent one-business day
time period ( _provided_ that in no event shall any such additional one-
business day time period be deemed to shorten the initial three-business day
time period)). The Company agrees that, during the period prior to its
effecting an Adverse Recommendation Change, the Company and its officers,
directors and representatives shall negotiate in good faith with Parent and
its officers, directors and representatives regarding any revisions to the
terms of the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement
proposed by Parent.

  



  

For purposes of this Agreement, the term " _Intervening Event_ " means an
event, which prior to the Stockholder Approval causes the Board of Directors
of the Company to conclude in good faith, after consultation with its outside
legal counsel, that its failure to effect an Adverse Recommendation Change
would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under applicable Law;
_provided_ , _however_ , that in no event shall the receipt, existence or
terms of a Takeover Proposal constitute an Intervening Event.

  



  

(c) In addition to the obligations of the Company set forth in paragraphs
(a) and (b) of this Section 4.02, the Company shall, as promptly as
practicable and in any event within 24 hours after the receipt thereof,
advise Parent of (i) any Takeover Proposal and (ii) the material terms and
conditions of such Takeover Proposal (including any subsequent material
amendment or other material modification to such terms and conditions) and
the identity of the person making any such Takeover Proposal.  Commencing
upon the provision of any notice referred to above, the Company (or its
outside counsel) shall (A) promptly following a reasonable request by Parent
(but in no event more than one time per week), reasonably update Parent
regarding the progress of negotiations concerning the applicable Takeover
Proposal, including material amendments as to price and other material terms
and (B) as promptly as practicable following receipt or delivery thereof,
provide Parent (or its outside counsel) with copies of all
documents providing for or reflecting any material terms or conditions of
such Takeover Proposal exchanged between the Company or its Subsidiaries and
the person making a Takeover Proposal or any of its affiliates or
representatives.

  



  

(d) Nothing contained in this Section 4.02 or elsewhere in this Agreement
shall prohibit the Company from (i) taking and disclosing to its stockholders
a position contemplated by Rule 14d-9 and Rule 14e 2(a) promulgated under
the Exchange Act or

  



         
 

  



  

(ii) making any disclosure to its stockholders if, in the good faith judgment
of the Board of Directors of the Company, failure to so disclose would be
inconsistent with applicable Law; provided, however, that in no event shall
the Company or its Board of Directors or any committee thereof take any
action prohibited by Section 4.02(b) (provided that the parties agree that
any "stop-look-and-listen" communication that contains only the information
set forth in Rule 14d-9(f) under the Exchange Act shall not be deemed an
Adverse Recommendation Change), unless such action is required by applicable
Law and if such action constitutes an Adverse Recommendation Change, then
Parent will have the right to terminate under Section 7.01(c).

  



  

SECTION 4.03. _Conduct by Parent_. During the period from the date of this
Agreement to the Effective Time, except with the prior written consent of the
Company (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed), Parent
shall and shall cause its Subsidiaries to not engage in any acquisition of
assets, businesses or entities related to mining equipment that would,
individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be likely to prevent or
materially delay the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement.

of filing of the preliminary Proxy Statement with the SEC and (ii) if
the Company does receive comments from the SEC with respect to the
preliminary Proxy Statement, clearance by the SEC with respect to such

(d) The Company and Parent each agrees, as to itself and its Subsidiaries,
that none of the information supplied or to be supplied by it or its
Subsidiaries for inclusion or incorporation by reference in the Proxy
Statement and any amendment or supplement thereto will, at the date of
mailing to stockholders and at the times of the meeting **** of stockholders
of the Company to be held in connection with the Merger, contain any untrue
statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact required to
be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in
light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading. If at
any time prior to the Effective Time any information relating to the Company
or Parent, or any of their respective affiliates, officers or directors,
should be discovered by the Company or Parent which should be set forth in an
amendment or supplement to the Proxy Statement so that any of such documents
would not include any misstatement of a material fact or omit to state any
material fact necessary to make the statements therein, in light of the
circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, the party that
discovers such information shall promptly notify the other parties hereto
and, to the extent required by Law, an appropriate amendment or supplement
describing such information shall be promptly filed with the SEC and
disseminated to the stockholders of the Company.

  



  

(e) Notwithstanding the foregoing, prior to filing or mailing the Proxy
Statement (or any amendment or supplement thereto) or responding to any
comments of the SEC with respect thereto, the Company (i) shall provide the
Parent an opportunity to review and comment on such document or response,
(ii) shall include in such document or response all comments reasonably
proposed by the other party and (iii) shall not file or mail such document,
or respond to the SEC, prior to receiving the approval of the other party,
which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed.

  



  

(f) The Company shall, subject to applicable law, as promptly as reasonably
practicable after the date of this Agreement, establish a record date for,
duly call, give notice of, convene and hold a meeting of its stockholders
(the " _Stockholders Meeting_ "), for the purpose of obtaining the
Stockholder Approval, regardless of whether the Board of Directors of the
Company determines at any time that this Agreement is no longer advisable or
recommends that the stockholders of the Company reject it or any other
Adverse Recommendation Change has occurred at any time. The notice of
such Stockholders Meeting shall state that a resolution to adopt this
Agreement will be considered at the Stockholders Meeting.  Subject to
Section 4.02(b), (x) the Board of Directors of the Company shall recommend to
holders of Company Common Stock that they adopt this Agreement and shall
include such recommendation in the Proxy Statement and (y) subject to the
applicable Law, the Company shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to
solicit the Stockholder Approval.

  



  

(g) Within 24 hours following the execution hereof, Parent, as sole
stockholder of Sub, shall adopt this Agreement.

Parents officers, employees, investment bankers, attorneys, accountants,
consultants and other representatives and advisors full access upon
reasonable advance notice and during normal business hours during the period
prior to the Effective Time or the termination of this Agreement to all their
respective properties, assets, books, records, Contracts, Permits, documents,
information, directors, officers and employees, and during such period the
Company shall, and shall cause each of its Subsidiaries to, furnish to Parent
any information concerning its business as Parent may reasonably request and
shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to afford access to Parent and
its representatives to the work papers of Deloitte and Touche LLP; _provided_ ,
that the foregoing shall not require the Company (i) to permit any
inspection, or to disclose any information, that in the reasonable judgment
of the Company, would result in the disclosure of any trade secrets of the
Company and its Subsidiaries or violate any of its obligations with respect
to confidentiality or (ii) to disclose any privileged information of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries. All requests for information made
pursuant to this Section 5.02 shall be directed to the executive officer or
other Person designated by the Company. No investigation by Parent or any of
its officers, directors, employees, investment bankers, attorneys,
accountants or other advisors or representatives and no other receipt of
information by Parent or any of its officers, directors, employees,
investment bankers, attorneys, accountants or other advisors or
representatives shall operate as a waiver or otherwise affect any
representation, warranty, covenant, agreement or other provision of this
Agreement, or the obligations of the parties (or remedies with respect
thereto) or the conditions to the obligations of the parties under the
Agreement. Parent will hold, and will direct its officers, employees,
investment bankers, attorneys, accountants and other advisors and
representatives to hold, any and all information received from the Company
confidential in accordance with the Confidentiality Agreement.

  



  

(b) Subject to applicable law, the Company and Parent shall, and shall cause
each of their respective Subsidiaries to, cooperate to ensure an orderly

permitted by applicable Law and without the waiver of any privilege, (A) meet
from time to time with the designated representative of the Parent ("
_Representative_ ") to provide briefings on the findings of and any
significant facts developed in connection with, and any strategy related to,
any internal investigations or inquiries being conducted by the Company or
its counsel related to the inquiry or investigation of the Governmental
Entity; (B) promptly provide the Representative each written communication
and a summary of each other substantive communication, excluding any document
production, transmitted by or on behalf of the Company or its counsel to the
Governmental Entity or transmitted to the

  



        
   

  



  

Company from the Government Entity; (C) provide a reasonable opportunity for
the Representative to attend any in-person meeting with the Governmental
Entity relating to the inquiry or investigation by the Governmental Entity
and, prior to attending such in-person meeting, to discuss the content and
strategy related to such meeting, subject in each case to the approval of the
Governmental Entity; and (D) act in good faith to limit the amount of fines,
penalties or any non-monetary obligations imposed by the Governmental Entity
with respect to the inquiry or investigation by the Governmental Entity in a
manner consistent with prior discussions between Company and the
Representative.

  



  

SECTION 5.03. _Efforts; Consultation and Notice_. (a) Upon the terms and
subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement and subject to Section
5.03(b)-(f), governing compliance with the HSR Act and obtaining required
approvals under the competition and foreign investment control Laws of
foreign countries, each of the parties hereto agrees to use its reasonable
best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions that are necessary,
proper or advisable to consummate and make effective the Merger and the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement promptly, including using its
reasonable best efforts to accomplish the following:  (i) the satisfaction
of the conditions precedent set forth in Article VI, (ii) the obtaining of
all necessary actions or nonactions, waivers, consents, approvals, orders and
authorizations from, and the giving of any necessary notices to, Governmental
Entities and other persons and the making of all necessary registrations,
declarations and filings, (iii) the taking of all reasonable steps to provide
any supplemental information requested by a Governmental Entity, including
participating in meetings with officials of such entity in the course of its
review of this Agreement, the Merger or the other transactions contemplated
by this Agreement, (iv) the taking of all reasonable steps as may be
necessary to avoid any suit, claim, action, investigation or proceeding by
any Governmental Entity or third party and (v) the obtaining of all necessary
consents, approvals or waivers from any third party. In connection with and
without limiting the generality of the foregoing, each of the Company and its
Board of Directors shall, if any state takeover statute or similar statute or
regulation is or becomes applicable to this Agreement or any of the Merger
and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement, take all actions
necessary to ensure that the Merger and the other transactions contemplated
by this Agreement may be consummated as promptly as practicable on the terms
contemplated by this Agreement and otherwise to minimize the effect of such
statute or regulation on this Agreement, the Merger and the
other transactions contemplated by this Agreement.  The Company and Parent
shall provide such assistance, information and cooperation to each other as
is reasonably required to obtain any such actions, nonactions, waivers,

advisable to permit consummation of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement as promptly as practicable; and (ii) the prompt use of its best
**** efforts to avoid the entry of any permanent, preliminary or temporary

including (A) the defense through litigation on the merits of any claim
asserted in any court, agency or other proceeding by any person or entity,
including any Governmental Entity, seeking to delay, restrain, prevent,

or other operations or interests therein of the Company or Parent or eithers
respective Subsidiaries (and the entry into agreements with, and submission
to orders of, the relevant Government Antitrust Entity giving effect thereto)
and agree to and implement such other actions, conditions, or limitations
sought by such Government Antitrust Entity if such actions would be
reasonably necessary to avoid, prevent, eliminate or remove any of the events
described above in this clause (ii); _provided_ that Parent may expressly
condition any such sale, lease, license, disposition or holding separate, or
any agreement to implement such other actions, conditions or

  



        
   

  



  

limitations, upon the consummation of the Merger and the other transactions

person for any divestiture, hold separate condition or any other restriction
with respect to any assets, businesses or product lines of either Parent or
the Company and shall have the obligation to defend any other proceeding
filed by such Government Antitrust Entity or other Person seeking to delay,
restrain, prevent, enjoin or otherwise prohibit consummation of the Merger,
and shall use its best efforts to defend such litigation and resist the entry
of any temporary, preliminary or permanent injunction or other order
that would have the effect of delaying, restraining, preventing, enjoining,
or otherwise prohibiting the transactions contemplated hereby, including by
taking the actions referred to in clause (d) above.

  



  

(e) (i)  Nothing in this Agreement shall require a Party to permit any
inspection or disclose any information that in such Partys good faith
judgment would (A) violate any law relating to the sharing of information
between competitors, provided that the Parties will provide summaries or

does not result in such a violation or improper disclosure or (B) waive any
privilege.

  



  

(ii)  Parent and the Company shall give prompt notice to the other party

be satisfied or (B) the failure of Parent, Sub or the Company to perform in
any material respect any obligation to be performed by such party under
this Agreement such that the condition set forth in Section 6.03(b)
or 6.02(b), as the case may be, could not be satisfied; provided, however,
that no such notification or failure to provide such notification shall
affect the representations, warranties, covenants, agreements or obligations
of the parties (or remedies with respect thereto) or the conditions to the
obligations of the parties under this Agreement and a failure to comply with
this Section 5.03(f)(ii) will not be deemed a breach of this Agreement.

consent of such person is required pursuant to a specified contract with such

SECTION 5.05. _Employee Benefits_.

  



  

(a) Parent agrees that it shall provide or cause to be provided, during the

Subsidiaries as of the Closing Date base salary, incentive compensation
opportunities and employee benefits which are substantially comparable in the
aggregate to the base salary, incentive compensation opportunities and

Company Employees immediately prior to the Closing Date. To the extent
applicable, Parent shall cause any employee benefit plans, programs, policies
and arrangements of Parent in which the Company Employees are entitled

benefits benefit accrual (but not for any other purpose, including, but not
limited to, benefit accrual under an employee pension benefit plan or for

Company Employees whose terms and conditions of employment are subject to a
collective bargaining agreement or agreement with works council or similar
organization, to any Company Employee after termination from employment with
the Company or its Subsidiaries, or to any Company Employees outside of the
United States whose terms and conditions of employment are governed
by applicable law.

Parent or any of its affiliates during the period commencing on the Closing
Date and ending on the first anniversary of the Closing Date, Parent shall
provide, or shall cause its affiliates to provide, severance benefits to such
Company Employee, which

  



        
   

  



  

shall be no less favorable than in accordance with the severance benefit plan
or agreement maintained by the Company or any of its affiliates for the
benefit of such Company Employee immediately prior to the Closing Date,
taking into account all service with the Company, Parent and their respective
affiliates in determining the amount of severance benefits payable. The
foregoing provisions of this Section 5.05(b) shall not apply to any Company
Employees whose terms and conditions of employment are subject to a
collective bargaining agreement or agreement with works council or similar
organization or to any Company Employees outside of the United States whose
severance entitlements are governed by applicable law.

  



  

(c) Parent shall, or shall cause the Surviving Corporation or Parents or
the Surviving Corporations Subsidiaries, as applicable, to: (i) waive any

Parent that provides health benefits in which Company Employees may be
eligible to participate following the Closing Date, (ii) honor any
deductible, co-payment and out-of-pocket maximums incurred by the Company
Employees and their eligible dependents under the health plans in which they

payments or out-of-pocket maximums under health plans of Parent, the
Surviving Corporation or any of their respective Subsidiaries in which they
are eligible to participate after the Closing Date in the same plan year in
which such deductibles, co-payments or out-of-pocket maximums were incurred
and (iii) waive any waiting period limitation or evidence of insurability
requirement that would otherwise be applicable to a Company Employee and his
or her eligible dependents on or after the Closing Date, in each case to the
extent such Company Employee or eligible dependent had satisfied any similar
limitation or requirement under a corresponding Benefit Plan prior to the
Effective Time.

  



  

(d) Parent shall, or shall cause the Surviving Corporation or Parents or
the Surviving Corporations Subsidiaries, as applicable, to honor the terms
of all Benefit Plans and Benefit Agreements existing and as in effect as of
immediately prior to the Closing Date, including any provisions relating to
change in control.

  



  

(e)  Prior to the Closing Date, the Company shall be permitted to enter into
the change in control, retention, bonus and compensation arrangements
disclosed in Section 5.05(e) of the Company Letter.

  



  

(f) Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing contained herein shall (i) be
treated as an amendment of any particular Benefit Plan or Benefit
Arrangement, (ii) give any third party, including Company Employees or any
representative thereof, any right to enforce the provisions of this Section
5.05 or (iii) obligate Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any of their

employment of any particular employee.

  



         
 

  



  

SECTION 5.06. _Indemnification, Exculpation and Insurance_.

  



  

(a) Each of Parent, Sub and the Surviving Corporation agrees that it will

officers of the Company and its Subsidiaries (including by providing all
rights to indemnification, advancement of expenses and exculpation from
liabilities) for acts or omissions occurring at or prior to the Effective
Time to the full extent now existing in favor of such persons as provided in
the respective certificates of incorporation or bylaws (or comparable
organizational documents) of the Company and each of its Subsidiaries. Any
and all indemnification or other agreements of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries as in effect on the date of this Agreement shall be assumed by
the Surviving Corporation in the Merger, without further action, at the
Effective Time, and shall survive the Merger and shall continue in full force
and effect in accordance with their terms, and Parent shall, and shall cause
the Surviving Corporation to, comply with and honor the obligations under
each such agreement.

  



  

(b) In the event that the Surviving Corporation or any of its successors or
assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any other person and is not the
continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation or merger
or (ii) transfers or conveys all or substantially all its properties
and assets to any person, or if Parent dissolves the Surviving Corporation
then, and in each such case, Parent shall cause proper provision to be made
so that the successors and assigns of the Surviving Corporation assume the
obligations set forth in this Section 5.06.

  



  

(c) Prior to the Closing, Parent shall obtain as of the Effective Time a
"tail" insurance policy with a claims period of six years from the Effective
Time with respect to directors and officers liability insurance covering
each person currently covered by the Companys directors and officers
liability insurance policy for acts or omissions occurring prior to the
Effective Time on terms that are no less favorable than those of such policy
of the Company in effect on the date of this Agreement, which insurance
shall, prior to the Closing, be in effect and prepaid for such six-year
period; _provided_ , that in the event Parent does not obtain such insurance
by the fifteenth business day prior to the Closing Date (the " _Insurance
Deadline_ "), Parent shall notify the Company that is has not obtained such
insurance and the Company shall have the right to obtain such insurance prior
to the effective Time; _provided_  that in no event shall Parent or the
Surviving Corporation be required to pay, and in no event shall the Company
pay, premiums for insurance under this Section 5.06(c) which in the aggregate
exceed 250% of the annual premiums paid by the Company as of the Effective
Time for such purpose; _provided_ that Parent shall nevertheless be obligated
to provide such coverage, with respect to the entire six-year period
following the Effective Time, as may be obtained for such 250% amount. If
requested by Parent, the Company shall issue a broker of record letter naming
the insurance broker selected by Parent to effect such runoff coverage until
the Insurance Deadline, and the Company shall provide reasonable cooperation
and information requested by Parent with respect to the procurement of such
runoff coverage.

  



        
   

  



  

(d) The provisions of this Section 5.06 (i) are intended to be for the
benefit of, and will be enforceable by, each indemnified party, his or her
heirs and his or her representatives and (ii) are in addition to, and not in
substitution for, any other rights to indemnification or contribution that
any such person may have by contract or otherwise.

  



  

SECTION 5.07. _Fees and Expenses_. (a) Except as expressly set forth in this
Section 5.07, all fees and expenses incurred in connection with
this Agreement and the transactions contemplated by this Agreement shall be
paid by the party incurring such fees or expenses, whether or not the Merger
is consummated.

  



  

(b) In the event that (i) a Takeover Proposal has been made to the Company
or publicly to its stockholders or any person has publicly announced an
intention (whether or not conditional and whether or not withdrawn) to make a
bona-fide Takeover Proposal or a bona-fide Takeover Proposal otherwise
becomes known to the Company or the stockholders of the Company and
thereafter (A) this Agreement is terminated by either Parent or the Company
pursuant to (x) Section 7.01(b)(i) and the conditions set forth in Section
6.03 would be satisfied if the Closing Date were to occur on the date of such
termination or (y) Section 7.01(b)(iii) and (B) prior to the date that is (x)

(y) twelve months after such termination (in the case of Section
7.01(b)(iii)), the Company or any of its Subsidiaries enters into any
Acquisition Agreement providing for a Takeover Proposal or any Takeover
Proposal is consummated (solely for purposes of this Section
5.07(b)(i)(B), the term "Takeover Proposal" shall have the meaning set forth
in the definition of Takeover Proposal contained in Section 4.02(a) except
that all references to "15% or more" shall be deemed references to "a
majority" and a Business Combination shall not be deemed a Takeover Proposal
unless it involves a majority of the Company Common Stock), and the
Acquisition Agreement or Takeover Proposal in the case of Section 7.01(b)(i)
shall be with the Person which made the Takeover Proposal prior to the
termination and shall provide for a value per share of Company Common Stock
equal to at least $96.60 or (ii) this Agreement is terminated by Parent
pursuant to Section 7.01(c), then, in each such case, the Company shall pay
Parent a fee equal to $200 million (the " _Termination Fee_ ") by wire
transfer of same-day funds (A) in the case of a termination by Parent
pursuant to Section 7.01(c), within two business days after such termination
and (B) in the case of a payment as a result of any event referred to

in each case to an account designated by Parent.

  



  

SECTION 5.08. _Public Announcements_. The parties agree that the initial
press release to be issued with respect to the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement shall be in the form heretofore agreed to by the parties.
Parent and Sub, on the one hand, and the Company, on the other hand, shall,

making, and give each other a reasonable opportunity to review and comment
upon, any press release or other public statements with respect to

this Agreement, and shall not issue any such press release or make any such
public statement prior to such reasonably practicable consultation, except as
may be required by applicable Law, court process or by obligations pursuant
to any listing agreement with any national securities exchange or national
securities quotation system.

  



  

SECTION 5.09. _Company Rights Agreement_. The Board of Directors of the
Company shall take all further actions (in addition to those referred to
in Section 3.01(s)) requested by Parent in order to render the Company
Rights inapplicable to this Agreement, the Merger, the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement and compliance with the terms of this
Agreement. Except as provided above with respect to this Agreement, the

employees and advisors, including legal and accounting, to provide reasonable

(the " _Financing_ ") after the date hereof, including using its commercially
reasonable efforts to (i) provide financial and other relevant information
regarding the Company and its Subsidiaries that is reasonably necessary and
cooperate in the preparation of pro forma financial information for the
Merger (including information to be used in the preparation of an information

document regarding the business, assets, operations, financial projections
and prospects of Parent and the Company customary for such financing or
reasonably necessary for the completion of the Financing) as may be required

which case such representation and warranty shall be true and correct in all

Effect. The Company shall have received a certificate signed on behalf of
Parent by an authorized signatory of Parent to such effect.

  



  

(b) _Performance of Obligations of Parent and Sub_.  Parent and Sub shall

give rise to the failure of a condition set forth in Section 6.02(a) or
6.02(b) and (B) is incapable of being cured by the Company by the date that
is 30 business days after such breach or failure or, if capable of being
cured by the Company by such date, the Company does not commence to cure such
breach or failure within 10 business days after its receipt of written notice

give rise to the failure of a condition set forth in Section 6.03(a) or
6.03(b) and (ii) is incapable of being cured by Parent or Sub by the date
that is 30 business days after such breach or failure or, if capable of being
cured by Parent or Sub by such date, Parent or Sub, as the case may be, does
not commence to cure such breach or failure within 10 business days after
its receipt of written notice thereof from the Company and diligently pursue
such cure thereafter.

  



  

SECTION 7.02. _Effect of Termination_. In the event of termination of this
Agreement by either the Company or Parent as provided in Section 7.01,
this Agreement shall forthwith become void and have no effect, without any
liability or obligation on the part of Parent, Sub or the Company, other than
the provisions of Section 3.01(u), the last sentence of Section
5.02(a), Section 5.07, this Section 7.02 and Article VIII and except

  



        
   

  



  

for any liabilities or damages resulting from any fraud or willful breach by
a party of any of its representations, warranties, covenants or agreements
set forth in this Agreement (which liability or damages therefor shall not
be affected by termination of this Agreement or any payment of the
Termination Fee pursuant to Section 5.07(b)).

  



  

SECTION 7.03. _Amendment_. This Agreement may be amended by the
parties hereto at any time, whether before or after the Stockholder Approval
has been obtained; _provided_ , _however_ , that after the Stockholder

approval of such stockholders. This Agreement may not be amended except by
an instrument in writing signed on behalf of each of the parties hereto.

agreements or conditions contained herein; _provided_ , _however_ , that
after the Stockholder Approval has been obtained, there shall be made no
waiver that by Law requires further approval by stockholders of the Company
without the further approval of such stockholders.  Any agreement on the
part of a party to any such extension or waiver shall be valid only if set
forth in an instrument in writing signed on behalf of such party which
specifically sets forth the terms of such extension or waiver. The failure or
delay by any party to this Agreement to assert any of its rights under this
Agreement or otherwise shall not constitute a waiver of such rights nor shall
any single or partial exercise by any party to this Agreement of any of its
rights under this Agreement preclude any other or further exercise of such
rights or any other rights under this Agreement.

meaning or interpretation of this Agreement. Any capitalized terms used in
any Schedule or Exhibit but not otherwise defined therein shall have the
meaning as defined in this Agreement. When a reference is made in this
Agreement to an Article, Section, Subsection, Schedule or Exhibit, such
reference shall be to a Section or Article of, or a Schedule or Exhibit to,
this Agreement unless otherwise indicated.  For all purposes hereof, the

otherwise) or remedies, whether as third-party beneficiaries or otherwise.

and construed in accordance with, the Laws of the State of Delaware,

principles of conflicts of Laws thereof.

  



  

SECTION 8.08. _Assignment_. Neither this Agreement nor any of the
rights, interests or obligations hereunder shall be assigned, in whole or in
part, by operation of Law or otherwise by any of the parties without the
prior written consent of the other parties, except that Sub may assign, in

under this Agreement to Parent or to any direct or indirect wholly owned

forth above shall be effective service of process for any action, suit or
proceeding in the State of Delaware with respect to any matters to which it
has submitted to jurisdiction as set forth above in the immediately preceding
sentence. Each of the parties hereto irrevocably and unconditionally waives
(and agrees not to plead or claim), any objection to the laying of venue of
any action, suit or proceeding arising out of this Agreement or the Merger or
any of the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement in the Delaware
Court of Chancery (and if the Delaware Court of Chancery shall be
unavailable, in any Delaware State court or the Federal court of the United
States of America sitting in the State of Delaware) or that any such action,
suit or proceeding brought in any such court has been brought in an
inconvenient forum.

  



        
   

  



  

SECTION 8.10. _Waiver of Jury Trial_. Each party hereto hereby waives, to
the fullest extent permitted by applicable Law, any right it may have to a
trial by jury in respect of any suit, action or other proceeding directly or
indirectly arising out of, under or in connection with this Agreement. Each
party hereto (a) certifies that no representative, agent or attorney of any
other party has represented, expressly or otherwise, that such party would
not, in the event of any action, suit or proceeding, seek to enforce the
foregoing waiver and (b) acknowledges that it and the other parties hereto
have been induced to enter into this Agreement, by, among other things, the
mutual waiver and certifications in this Section 8.10.

  



  

SECTION 8.11. _Enforcement_. The parties agree that irreparable damage would
occur in the event that any of the provisions of this Agreement were

enforce specifically the terms and provisions of this Agreement in the
Delaware Court of Chancery (and if the Delaware Court of Chancery shall be
unavailable, in any Delaware State court or the Federal court of the United
States of America sitting in the State of Delaware), this being in addition
to any other remedy to which they are entitled at Law or in equity.

  



  

SECTION 8.12. _Consents and Approvals_. For any matter under this Agreement
requiring the consent or approval of any party to be valid and binding on the
parties hereto, such consent or approval must be in writing and executed and
delivered to the other parties by a person duly authorized by such party to
do so.

  



  

SECTION 8.13. _Severability_. If any provision of this Agreement or
the application of any such provision to any person or circumstance shall be
held invalid, illegal or unenforceable in any respect by a court of
competent jurisdiction, such invalidity, illegality or unenforceability shall
not affect the validity, legality or enforceability of any other provision
hereof and the invalidity of a particular provision in a particular
jurisdiction shall not invalidate such provision in any other jurisdiction.

  



        
   

  



  

IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the parties hereto have caused this Agreement to be
signed by their respective officers thereunto duly authorized, all as of the
date first written above.
