Section 2.6 _Post-Closing Payment Reconciliation_.

 

(a) Prior to or on the date that is ninety (90) days after the Closing Date,
Acquiror shall prepare and deliver or cause to be prepared and delivered to

Acquirors good faith calculation of the Net Working Capital as of the Closing
Date for the Company Group, based on the Company Financial Statements and
consistent with the methodology for the Company Group set forth on _Schedule
2.5_ (collectively, the " _Closing Net Working Capital_ "). Acquirors
calculation of the Closing Net Working Capital shall be determined in
accordance with GAAP applied using the accounting principles, practices and
methods that were used in the preparation of the Company Financial Statements
and consistent with the methodology for the Company Group set forth on 
_Schedule 2.5_.

(b) After receipt of the Adjustment Statement, Contributors shall have thirty
(30) days to review the factual basis, mathematical calculations and
accounting methods used therein. On or prior to the thirtieth (30th) day after
receipt of the Adjustment Statement, Contributors shall deliver
written notice to Acquiror specifying any disputed items (the " _Initial
Reconciliation Disputes_ ") and the basis therefor and amount thereof. If
Contributors fail to notify Acquiror of any Initial Reconciliation Disputes on
or prior to the thirtieth (30th) day after receipt of the Adjustment
Statement, then all calculations and valuations of the Closing Net Working
Capital set forth on the Adjustment Statement shall be deemed accepted by
Contributors and shall be final, binding, conclusive and non-appealable for
all purposes of this Agreement.

(c) If Contributors notifies Acquiror of any Initial Reconciliation Disputes
in accordance with _Section 2.6(b_), then Acquiror and Contributors shall,
over the fifteen (15) days following the date of such notice (the "
_Resolution Period_ "), attempt in good faith to resolve the Initial
Reconciliation Disputes, and any written resolution by them as to any disputed
item shall be final, binding, conclusive and non-appealable for all purposes
of this Agreement. If, at the conclusion of the Resolution Period, Acquiror
and Contributors have not reached an agreement on all disputed items, then all
Initial Reconciliation Disputes then remaining in dispute (the " _Final
Reconciliation Disputes_ ") shall be submitted by Acquiror and Contributors
to an Independent Auditor upon which Acquiror and Contributors shall
reasonably agree prior to expiration of the Resolution Period. All fees and
expenses relating to the work, if any, to be performed by such Independent
Auditor pursuant to this _Section 2.6_ shall be borne by Contributors, on the
one hand, and by Acquiror, on the other hand, based upon the percentage that
the amount ultimately awarded or not awarded, as applicable, to such Party by
such Independent Auditor bears to the amount actually contested by such Party
in the Final Reconciliation Disputes. Except as provided in the preceding
sentence, all other costs and expenses incurred by the Parties in connection
with resolving any Final Reconciliation Disputes hereunder before such
Independent Auditor shall be borne by the Party incurring such cost and

 



15  expense. With respect to each disputed line item of the Closing Net Working
Capital, such Independent Auditors final determination, if not in accordance
with the position of either Contributors, on the one hand, or Acquiror, on
the other hand, will not be in excess of the higher, nor less than the lower,
of the amounts advocated by Acquiror in its calculation of the Closing Net
Working Capital or the corresponding amounts claimed by Contributors in the
initial notice of any Initial Reconciliation Disputes delivered by
Contributors pursuant to _Section 2.6(b)_. For the avoidance of doubt, the
Independent Auditor shall not review any line item or make any determination
with respect to any matter other than the Final Reconciliation Disputes. The
Parties shall instruct the Independent Auditor to render its reasoned written
decision, acting as an expert and not as an arbitrator, as soon as
practicable but in no event later than sixty (60) days after its engagement
(which engagement shall be made no later than ten (10) Business Days after the
end of the Resolution Period). Such decision shall be determined in accordance
with GAAP applied using the accounting principles, practices and methods that
were used in the preparation of the Company Financial Statements and
consistent with the methodology for the Company Group set forth on _Section
2.6_ shall be set forth in a written statement delivered to Acquiror and
Contributors and shall be final, binding, conclusive and non-appealable for
all purposes hereunder. Notwithstanding anything else contained herein, no
Party may assert that any award issued by the Independent Auditor is
unenforceable because it has not been timely rendered. The term " _Final
Adjustment Statement_ " shall mean the definitive Adjustment Statement setting
forth the final determination of the Closing Net Working Capital (the "
_Final Closing Net Working Capital_ ") and resulting from (i) agreement by
Acquiror and Contributors during the Resolution Period or otherwise, (ii) a
deemed acceptance pursuant to _Section 2.6(b)_ and/or (iii) the
determination by an Independent Auditor in accordance with this _Section
2.6(c)_.

(d) If the Final Closing Net Working Capital is greater than the Estimated
Closing Net Working Capital, then Acquiror shall pay to Contributors an amount
equal to such excess in the manner set forth in _Section 2.6(f)_. Conversely,
if the Final Closing Net Working Capital is less than the Estimated Closing
Net Working Capital, then Contributors shall pay to Acquiror an amount equal
to such difference in the manner set forth in _Section 2.6(f)_.

 

(e) For purposes of calculating Closing Net Working Capital and without
limiting the provisions of _Section 2.6(a)_ and the generality of _Section

and assets owned, leased or operated by it, or the nature of the business
conducted by it, makes such qualification or licensing necessary, except in
such jurisdictions where the failure to be so duly qualified or licensed and
in good standing would not reasonably be expected to have a Company Material
Adverse Effect.

respective Governing Documents of each member of the Company Group. There is
no pending, or to the knowledge of the Contributors, threatened action for the
dissolution, liquidation or insolvency of any member of the Company Group.

its own investigation and analysis and the representations and warranties of
the Acquiror Parties expressly contained in _Article 5_ and the Acquiror
Certificate and such Contributor acknowledges that, other than as set forth in
this Agreement (as modified by the Schedules) and the certificates or
other instruments delivered pursuant hereto, none of Acquiror, the members of
the Acquiror Group or any of their respective directors, officers, employees,
Affiliates, stockholders, agents or representatives makes or has made any
representation or warranty, either express or implied, (x) as to the accuracy
or completeness of any of the information provided or made available to such
Contributor or any of its respective agents, representatives, lenders or
Affiliates prior to the execution of this Agreement (other than, for the
avoidance of doubt, as set forth in this Agreement) or (y) with respect to any
projections, forecasts, estimates, plans or budgets of future revenues,
expenses or expenditures, future results of operations (or any component
thereof), future cash flows (or any component thereof) or future financial
condition (or any component thereof) of any member of the Acquiror Group
heretofore or hereafter delivered to or made available to such Contributor or
any of its respective agents, representatives, lenders or Affiliates. It is
understood that any cost estimates, projections or other predictions, any
data, any financial information or any memoranda or offering materials or
presentations are not and shall not be deemed to be or to include
representations or warranties of any member of the Acquiror Group or Acquiror
(other than, for the avoidance of doubt, as set forth in this Agreement as
modified by the Schedules), and are not and shall not be deemed to be relied
upon by such Contributor in executing, delivering and performing this
Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby.

 

Section 4.8 _Management Projections and Budget_. The projections and budget
set forth on _Schedule 4.8_ provided to Acquiror by Contributors as part of
Acquirors review in connection with this Agreement were prepared by
management of Contributors in good faith based on assumptions that they

contemplated hereby.

(c) In entering into this Agreement, Acquiror has relied solely upon its
own investigation and analysis and the representations and warranties of the
Company and Contributors expressly contained in _Article 3_ and _Article 4_ ,

(d) Acquiror and Contributors shall cooperate fully, as and to the extent
reasonably requested by the other Party, in connection with the preparation,
filing and execution of Tax Returns (including Tax Returns of each Contributor
with respect to the business activities

 



37  of the Company Group) and any audit, litigation or other proceeding (each a
" _Tax Proceeding_ ") with respect to Taxes imposed on or with respect to the
Company or the assets of the Company Group for any Pre-Closing Tax Period or
Straddle Period. Such cooperation shall include the retention and (upon the
other Partys request) the provision of records and information that
are reasonably relevant to any such Tax Return or Tax Proceeding and making
employees available on a mutually convenient basis to provide additional
information and explanation of any material provided hereunder or to testify
at any such Tax Proceeding. Contributors and the Company Group agree to (and,
in the case of the Company Group, will cause the Company Group to) retain all
books and records with respect to Tax matters pertinent to the Company Group
until six (6) months following the expiration of the statute of limitations
(and any extensions thereof) of the respective Pre-Closing Tax Periods. Each
Contributor shall have the right to settle, compromise or litigate any matter
described above in this subsection (d) that could give rise to an
indemnification obligation on the part of such Contributor pursuant to this
Agreement. Acquiror and Contributors further agree, upon request, to use their
commercially reasonable efforts to obtain any certificate or other document
from any Taxing Authority or any other Person or take any other action as may
be necessary to mitigate, reduce or eliminate any Tax that could be imposed on
any Party (including with respect to the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement).

Pre-Closing Tax Periods shall be the property of Contributors. The Company
Group will not, and Acquiror will not permit the Company Group to, forfeit,
fail to collect or otherwise minimize any Pre-Closing Tax Refund whether
through any election to carry forward a net operating loss or otherwise
(regardless of whether Acquiror or the Company Group otherwise is legally
permitted to take such action). Acquiror shall pay to HHI (and HHI shall pay
to ETP Holdco its proportionate share of) any Pre-Closing Tax Refund, together
with any interest thereon, received after the Closing Date within fifteen
(15) days of such receipt. A Pre-Closing Tax Refund shall be "received" for
purposes of this Agreement (i) on the day of receipt of any actual refund of
Taxes or (ii) on the day of filing of any Tax Return that applies what would
have been a Pre-Closing Tax Refund to the payment of Taxes for another taxable
period.

 

(f) The Parties do not expect that the transfer of Acquired Interests pursuant
to this Agreement will result in any state and local transfer, sales, use,
registration, stamp or other similar Taxes (" _Transfer Taxes_ "). However, if
any Transfer Taxes are imposed on the transfer of the Acquired Interests
pursuant to this Agreement, such Transfer Taxes shall be borne equally by
Acquiror, on the one hand, and Contributors, on the other hand. The Parties
shall cooperate in good faith to minimize, to the extent permissible under
applicable Law, the amount of any such Transfer Taxes.

the confidentiality agreements to which the Company is subject, the Company
shall provide to the Acquiror Parties and their authorized representatives
during normal business hours reasonable access to all books and records of the
Company (in a manner so as to not unreasonably interfere with the normal
business operations of the Company) and the Company shall furnish promptly
to Acquiror Parties and their representatives such information concerning
their business, properties, Contracts, assets,

 



38  liabilities and employees as the Acquiror Parties and their representatives
may reasonably request; _provided_ , that in no event shall the foregoing
include any sampling or analysis of soil, groundwater, building materials or
other environmental media of the sort generally referred to as a Phase II
environmental investigation nor may the Acquiror Parties require that such
Phase II environmental investigation be conducted.

and the Company shall use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain consents
of all Governmental Entities or other third parties necessary to consummate

connection with obtaining such consents shall be borne by the Party incurring
such costs and, in no event, shall either Contributor, any of their

facilitate the obtaining of any such consents.

commenced which questions the validity or legality of the transactions
contemplated hereby or seeks damages in connection therewith, the Parties

Proceeding, to use commercially reasonable efforts to have such injunction or
other order lifted, and to cooperate reasonably regarding any other impediment
to the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby.

(c) Contributors and the Acquiror Parties shall permit counsel for the other
Party reasonable opportunity to review in advance, and consider in good faith
the views of the other Party in connection with, any proposed written
communication to any Governmental Entity relating to the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement. Each Contributor and each Acquiror Party
agrees not to participate in any substantive meeting or discussion, either in
person or by telephone with any Governmental Entity in connection with the

press release or make any such public statement prior to such consultation and
prior written consent; _provided_ that each Party may make any such
announcement which it in good faith believes, based on advice of counsel, is
necessary in connection with any requirement of Law, it being understood and
agreed that each Party shall provide the other Parties with copies of any such
announcement in advance of such issuance.

modification of the underlying Contract that is subject to the Contributor
Guarantee in a way which would affect the related Contributor Guarantee in

to recover Losses in excess of such amount, subject to the other limitations
set forth herein.

 

(d) Acquiror shall not be liable to the Contributor Indemnitees for
indemnification under _Section 9.3(a)_ (other than with respect to a claim
for indemnification with respect to or by reason of any Acquiror Fundamental
Representation) for any particular Loss (including any series of related
Losses) indemnifiable pursuant to _Section 9.3(a)_ (other than those
with respect to any Acquiror Fundamental Representation), unless such Loss
(including any series of related Losses) equals or exceeds the Per Claim
Deductible, and any Losses (or series of related Losses) that are less than
the Per Claim Deductible (other than those with respect to any Acquiror
Fundamental Representation) shall not be included in the aggregate Losses
indemnifiable pursuant to _Section 9.3(a)_, including for purposes of the
calculation in _Section 9.4(c)_. 

(e) The maximum aggregate liability of each Contributor (other than with
respect to a claim for indemnification with respect to a breach of a
Contributor Fundamental Representation) with respect to Losses indemnifiable
pursuant to _Section 9.2(a)_ shall be their respective proportionate share of
the Cap; _provided_ , that the maximum aggregate liability of HHI pursuant to
this _Article 9_ shall not exceed sixty-six percent (66%) of the Aggregate Cap
and the maximum aggregate liability of ETP Holdco pursuant to this _Article 9_
shall not exceed thirty-four percent (34%) of the Aggregate Cap. 

(f) The maximum aggregate liability of Acquiror (other than with respect to a
claim for indemnification with respect to a breach of an Acquiror Fundamental
Representation) with respect to Losses indemnifiable pursuant to _Section
9.3(a)_ shall be the Cap; _provided_ , that the maximum liability of Acquiror
pursuant to this _Article 9_ shall not exceed the Aggregate Cap.

(g) An Indemnifying Party (as defined below) shall be obligated to pay for the
same Loss only once under this _Article 9_ even if a claim for
indemnification in respect of such Loss has been made as a result of a breach
of more than one representation, warranty, covenant or agreement contained in
this Agreement.

 

(h) For purposes of this _Article 9_ , any inaccuracy in or breach of any
representation or warranty, and any damages resulting therefrom, shall be
determined without regard to any materiality, Material Adverse Effect or other
similar qualification contained in or otherwise applicable to such
representation or warranty.

 

(i) Subject to the provisions of this _Section 9.4(i)_ the amount of any and
all Losses shall be determined net of (i) any amounts in payment for Losses
actually received by any

 



49  of the Acquiror Indemnitees or Contributor Indemnitees, as applicable, (net
of any related costs and expenses incurred in connection therewith, including
the direct costs of premiums relating to any such insurance proceeds) under
or pursuant to (x) any insurance coverage or storage tank fund and all
arrangements set forth on _Schedule 3.10_ or _Schedule 5.8_ and (y) any
other indemnity or reimbursement arrangement or Contract, or from other
collateral sources (collectively, " _Alternative Arrangements_ "), and (ii)
any Tax benefits arising from the incurrence or payment of the underlying
obligations relating to such Losses actually realized for the year of such
incurrence or payment. The Acquiror Indemnitees shall use commercially
reasonable efforts to collect all amounts available and recoverable under any
Alternative Arrangements and Contributors shall provide reasonable
cooperation to the Acquiror Indemnitees undertaking such efforts, including by
providing reasonable access to any documents, reports, data or other
information in the possession of Contributors required by the Acquiror
Indemnitees or any Alternative Arrangements; _provided_ , _however_ , that,
(A) in no event shall the expenditure of such efforts require the Acquiror
Indemnitees to expend any such efforts prior to submitting a claim for
indemnification under this Agreement, (B) nothing provided herein shall
require any Acquiror Indemnitee to avail itself of any available policies of
self-insurance other than any Alternative Arrangements, and (C) if Acquiror
seeks indemnification from Contributor, Acquiror shall provide Contributors
with documents and information directly related to such efforts and recovery,
as reasonably requested by Contributors. For the avoidance of doubt,
Contributors shall not be liable for any Losses related to any breach of the
representations and warranties set forth in _Section 3.10_ ( _Environmental
Matters_ ) unless and until the Acquiror Indemnitees have exhausted their
remedies under all Alternative Arrangements reasonably available to
such Acquiror Indemnitees, and thereafter, Contributors shall only be
responsible for the portion of any Losses that is not satisfied or covered by
any reasonably available Alternative Arrangements (net of any related costs
and expenses incurred in connection therewith, including the direct costs of
premiums relating to any insurance proceeds) after satisfaction or payment of
any deductible or retention thereunder; _provided_ , _however_ , that, in no
event, shall the exhaustion of such remedies require the Acquiror Indemnitees
to exhaust any such remedies prior to submitting a claim for indemnification
under this Agreement. For purposes hereof, Acquiror shall have satisfied the
"exhaustion of remedies" of Alternative Arrangements as long as Acquiror has
commenced a Proceeding in pursuit of the Alternative Arrangements and Acquiror
prosecutes such Proceeding in good faith in an attempt to avail itself of the
Alternative Arrangements; _provided_ ,  _however_ , that "exhaustion of
remedies" shall not require Acquiror to pursue or appeal any decision issued
in connection with any Proceeding.

 

(j) In any case where a Acquiror Indemnitee, directly or indirectly through
the Company, recovers, under any Alternative Arrangements, any amount in
respect of a matter for which such Acquiror Indemnitee was, prior to such
recovery, indemnified pursuant to _Section 9.2_, such Acquiror Indemnitee,
or, if applicable, the Company, shall promptly pay over to each Contributor
any amount so recovered from such Contributor (after deducting therefrom the
amount of the expenses incurred by such Acquiror Indemnitee in procuring such
recovery), but not in excess of the sum of (i) any amount previously so paid
by such Contributor to or on behalf of such Acquiror Indemnitee in respect of
such matter and (ii) any amount actually expended by such Contributor in
pursuing or defending any claim arising out of such matter that is
indemnifiable as a Loss hereunder. 

 



50 (k) (i) The Acquiror Indemnitees shall not be entitled to indemnification
pursuant to  _Section 9.2_ for any Loss to the extent that such Loss is
reflected as a liability on the Latest Company Balance Sheet or reflected in
the footnotes to the Company Financial Statements and (ii) the Contributor
Indemnitees shall not be entitled to indemnification pursuant to _Section
9.3_ for any Loss to the extent that such Loss is reflected as a liability on
the Latest Acquiror Balance Sheet or reflected in the financial statements of
Acquiror included in the Acquiror SEC Documents, in each case of clauses (i)
and (ii), only to the extent that amounts associated with such Loss are
included therein.

 

(l) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, Contributors shall not be
obligated to indemnify the Acquiror Indemnitees for any Loss with respect to
any environmental matter or condition, including for any inaccuracy or breach
of the representations and warranties in _Section 3.10_ ( _Environmental
Matters_ ), that is discovered or detected by any sampling, investigation,
analysis or reporting unless: (i) such sampling, investigating, analysis or
reporting is affirmatively required by Environmental Laws or by a Governmental
Entity; (ii) such sampling, investigation, analysis or reporting is necessary
to conduct in defense of a Third Party Claim (as defined below) against
Acquiror Indemnitees alleging that Hazardous Substances have migrated off of
any Company Owned Real Property or Company Leased Real Property; or (iii)
such sampling, investigation, analysis or reporting is conducted in
connection with the bona fide construction or expansion of improvements by any
Acquiror Indemnitee at any Company Real Property undertaken in the ordinary
course of business, and in such case only to the extent such sampling,
investigation, analysis or reporting is consistent with industry practice. Any
indemnification of any of the Acquiror Indemnitees with respect to any
remediation, removal or cleanup, including any investigation, monitoring, or
remedial obligations, shall be limited to such cost effective action that is
required by Environmental Laws or by a Governmental Entity to attain
compliance with minimum applicable remedial standards for continued use of
the relevant property or facility as a gasoline fueling and service station
and/or convenience store with gasoline fueling operations, employing, if
appropriate, available or acceptable, permissible risk-based remedial
standards and reasonable deed or use restrictions and institutional controls.

Section 9.5 _Indemnification Procedures_. The party making a claim under this
_Article 9_ is referred to as the " _Indemnified Party_ ", and the party
against whom such claim is asserted under this _Article 9_ is referred to as
the " _Indemnifying Party_ ".

 

(a) _Third Party Claims_. If any Indemnified Party receives notice of the
assertion or commencement of any Proceeding made or brought by any Person who
is not a party to this Agreement or an Affiliate of a party to this Agreement
or a representative of the foregoing (a " _Third Party Claim_ ") against such
Indemnified Party with respect to which the Indemnifying Party is obligated
to provide indemnification under this Agreement, the Indemnified Party shall
give the Indemnifying Party reasonably prompt written notice thereof, but in
any event not later than thirty (30) calendar days after receipt of such
notice of such Third Party Claim. The failure to give such prompt written
notice shall not, however, relieve the Indemnifying Party of its
indemnification obligations, except and only to the extent that the
Indemnifying Party is actually and materially prejudiced thereby. Such notice
by the Indemnified Party shall describe the Third Party Claim in reasonable
detail, shall include copies of all material written evidence thereof and
shall indicate the estimated amount, if reasonably practicable, of the Loss
that has been or may reasonably be sustained by the Indemnified Party. The
Indemnifying Party shall have the right to

 



51  participate in, or by giving written notice to the Indemnified Party, to
assume the conduct and control of the settlement or defense of any Third Party
Claim at the Indemnifying Partys expense and by the Indemnifying Partys own
counsel, and the Indemnified Party shall cooperate in good faith in such
defense; _provided_ , that if the Indemnifying Party is Contributor, such
Indemnifying Party shall not have the right to defend or direct the defense
of any such Third Party Claim that seeks an injunction or other equitable
relief against the Indemnified Party. In the event that the Indemnifying Party
assumes the defense of any Third Party Claim, subject to  _Section 9.5(b)_,
it shall have the right to take such action as it deems necessary to avoid,
dispute, defend, appeal or make counterclaims pertaining to any such Third
Party Claim in the name and on behalf of the Indemnified Party.
The Indemnified Party shall have the right to participate in the defense of
any Third Party Claim with counsel selected by it subject to the Indemnifying
Partys right to control the settlement and defense thereof. The fees and
disbursements of such counsel shall be at the expense of the Indemnified
Party; _provided_ , that if in the reasonable opinion of counsel to the
Indemnified Party, (A) there are legal defenses available to an Indemnified
Party that are different from or additional to those available to the
Indemnifying Party; or (B) there exists a conflict of interest between the
Indemnifying Party and the Indemnified Party that cannot be waived, the
Indemnifying Party shall be liable for the reasonable fees and expenses of
one counsel to the Indemnified Party. If the Indemnifying Party elects not to
compromise or defend such Third Party Claim, the Indemnified Party may,
subject to _Section 9.5(b)_, pay, compromise or defend such Third
Party Claim and seek indemnification for any and all Losses based upon,
arising from or relating to such Third Party Claim. Contributors and Acquiror
shall cooperate with each other in all reasonable respects in connection with
the defense of any Third Party Claim, including making available records
relating to such Third Party Claim and furnishing, without expense (other than
reimbursement of actual out-of-pocket expenses) to the defending party, such
management employees of the non-defending party, information and testimony,
and attending such conferences, discovery proceedings, hearings, trials and
appeals as may be reasonably necessary for the preparation of the defense of
such Third Party Claim.

 

(b) _Settlement of Third Party Claims_. Notwithstanding any other provision of
this Agreement, the Indemnifying Party shall not enter into settlement of any
Third Party Claim without the prior written consent of the Indemnified Party,
except to the extent such settlement does not provide for liability or the
creation of a financial or other obligation on the part of the Indemnified
Party and provides, in customary form, for the unconditional release of each
Indemnified Party from all liabilities and obligations in connection with such
Third Party Claim. If the Indemnified Party has assumed the defense pursuant
to  _Section 9.5(a)_, it shall not agree to any settlement without the
written consent of the Indemnifying Party (which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld or delayed), and no such settlement shall be
determinative of the Indemnifying Partys obligations under this _Article 9_.

(c) _Direct Claims_. Any claim by an Indemnified Party on account of a
Loss which does not result from a Third Party Claim (a " _Direct Claim_ ")
shall be asserted by the Indemnified Party giving the Indemnifying Party
reasonably prompt written notice thereof, but in any event not later than
thirty (30) calendar days after the Indemnified Party becomes aware of the
matter or circumstance alleged to give rise to such Direct Claim. The failure
to give such prompt written notice shall not, however, relieve the
Indemnifying Party of its indemnification obligations, except and only to the
extent that the Indemnifying Party is actually and materially

 



52  prejudiced thereby. Such notice by the Indemnified Party shall describe the
Direct Claim in reasonable detail, shall include copies of all material
written evidence thereof and shall indicate the estimated amount of the Loss
that has been or may be reasonably sustained by the Indemnified Party. The
Indemnified Party shall allow the Indemnifying Party and its professional
advisors to investigate the matter or circumstance alleged to give rise to
the Direct Claim, and whether and to what extent any amount is payable in
respect of the Direct Claim, and the Indemnified Party shall assist the
Indemnifying Partys investigation by giving such information and assistance
(including access to the Companys premises and personnel and the right to
examine and copy any accounts, documents or records) as the Indemnifying Party
or any of its professional advisors may reasonably request.

 

Section 9.6 _Subrogation_. In the event of payment by or on behalf of any
Indemnifying Party to any Indemnified Party (including pursuant to this
_Article 9_ ) in connection with any Third Party Claim, such Indemnifying
Party shall be subrogated to and shall stand in the place of such Indemnified
Party as to any events or circumstances in respect of which such
Indemnified Party may have any right, defense or claim relating to such claim
or demand against any claimant or plaintiff asserting such claim or demand.
Such Indemnified Party shall cooperate with such Indemnifying Party in a
reasonable manner, and at the cost of such Indemnifying Party, in presenting
any subrogated right, defense or claim.

Section 9.7 _Tax Treatment of Indemnification Payments_. All indemnification
payments made under this Agreement shall be treated by the Parties as an
adjustment to the Consideration for Tax purposes, and to the extent possible,
first as an adjustment to the Cash Consideration, unless otherwise required
by Law.

Section 9.8 _Exclusive Remedies_. Except with respect to _Section 8.2_, the
Parties acknowledge and agree that, from and after the Closing, their sole
and exclusive remedy with respect to any and all claims (other than claims for
fraud on the part of a party in connection with the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement, which such claims shall not be subject to any monetary or
survival limitations set forth herein, and other than claims to enforce, or
for breach of, Guaranteed Obligations pursuant to _Section 10.19_) for any
breach of any representation, warranty, covenant, agreement or obligation set
forth herein or otherwise relating to or in any way arising from the subject
matter of this Agreement, shall be pursuant to the indemnification provisions
set forth in this _Article 9_ , and the Parties hereby waive any other
statutory and common law remedies or claims. Without limiting the generality
of the foregoing, Acquiror acknowledges and agrees that each Acquiror
Indemnitees right to indemnification under this _Article 9_  for any
environmental matter, including for any breach or inaccuracy of the
representations and warranties contained in _Section 3.10_ ( _Environmental
Matters_ ), shall constitute such Acquiror Indemnitees sole and
exclusive remedy against Contributors with respect to any environmental
matter, including any such matter arising under any Environmental Laws. The
Acquiror Indemnitees hereby, except as specifically reserved under this
_Article 9_ , (a) waive any remedies or claims that may be available under
Environmental Laws relating to the subject matter of this Agreement, and (b)
release Contributors from any claim, demand or liability with respect to any
environmental matters relating to the subject matter of this Agreement,
including any such claims arising under Environmental Laws.

amount in the representations or warranties contained in this Agreement or

that such amounts, or higher or lower amounts or the items so included or
other items, are or are not material, and no Party shall use the fact of the
setting of such amounts or the inclusion of any such item in any dispute or
controversy as to whether any obligation, items or matter not described herein

Section 10.7 _Parties in Interest_. This Agreement shall be binding upon and

"to Contributors knowledge" and any derivations thereof shall mean, as of
the applicable date, the actual knowledge of the officers of the Company or
such Contributor, as applicable (none of whom shall have any personal
liability or obligations regarding such knowledge). For all purposes of this
Agreement, the phrase "to Acquirors knowledge" and any derivations thereof

either Acquiror Party, as applicable (none of whom shall have any personal
liability or obligations regarding such knowledge).

acknowledges that no recourse under this Agreement or any documents or
instruments delivered in connection with this Agreement shall be had against
any current or future director, officer, employee or member of either
Contributor or of any Affiliate or assignee thereof, as such, whether by the
enforcement of any assessment or by any legal or equitable proceeding, or by
virtue of any statute, regulation or other applicable Law, it being expressly
agreed and acknowledged that no personal liability whatsoever shall attach
to, be imposed on or otherwise be incurred by any current or future officer,
agent or employee of either Contributor or any current or future member of
either Contributor or any current or future director, officer, employee or
member of either Contributor or of any Affiliate or assignee thereof, as such,
for any obligation of either Contributor under this Agreement or any documents
or instruments delivered in connection with this Agreement for any claim
based on, in respect of or by reason of such obligations or their creation.

Section 10.14 _Waiver of Jury Trial_. Each Party hereby waives, to the

any way connected with or related or incidental to the dealings of the
Parties in respect of this Agreement or any of the transactions related
hereto, in each case, whether now existing or hereafter arising, and whether
in contract, tort, equity, or otherwise. Each Party hereby further agrees
and consents that any such claim, demand, action, or cause of action shall be

this Agreement with any court as written evidence of the consent of the
Parties to the waiver of their right to trial by jury.

Section 10.15 _Jurisdiction and Venue_. Each of the Parties (i) submits to the
exclusive general jurisdiction of the Court of Chancery for the State of
Delaware (the " _Chancery Court_ ") and any state appellate court therefrom
located within the State of Delaware (or, only if the Chancery Court declines
to accept jurisdiction over a particular matter, any state or federal court

 



57  within the State of Delaware) in any Proceeding arising out of or relating
to this Agreement, (ii) agrees that all claims in respect of such Proceeding
may be heard and determined in any such court and (iii) agrees not to bring
any Proceeding arising out of or relating to this Agreement in any other
court. Each of the Parties waives any defense of inconvenient forum to the
maintenance of any Proceeding so brought and waives any bond, surety or other
security that might be required of any other Party with respect thereto. Each
Party agrees that service of summons and complaint or any other process that
might be served in any Proceeding may be made on such Party by sending or
delivering a copy of the process to the Party to be served at the address of
the Party and in the manner provided for the giving of notices in _Section
10.2_. Nothing in this _Section 10.15_, _however_ , shall affect the right
of any Party to serve legal process in any other manner permitted by Law. Each
Party agrees that a final, non-appealable judgment in any Proceeding so
brought shall be conclusive and may be enforced by suit on the judgment or in
any other manner provided by Law.

Section 10.16 _Remedies_. Except as otherwise expressly provided herein, any
and all remedies provided herein will be deemed cumulative with and not
exclusive of any other remedy conferred hereby, or by Law or equity upon such
party, and the exercise by a party of any one remedy will not preclude the
exercise of any other remedy. The Parties agree and acknowledge that
irreparable damage for which monetary damages, even if available, would not be
an adequate remedy, would occur in the event that the parties hereto do not
perform their respective obligations under the provisions of this Agreement
(including failing to take such actions as are required of them hereunder to
consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement) in accordance with
their specific terms or otherwise breach such provisions. It is accordingly
agreed that, prior to the valid termination of this Agreement pursuant to
_Section 8.1_, the Parties shall be entitled to an injunction or injunctions,
specific performance and other equitable relief to prevent breaches of this
Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions of this
Agreement, in each case without posting a bond or undertaking, this being in
addition to any other remedy to which they are entitled at Law or in equity.
Each of the Parties agrees that it will not oppose the granting of an
injunction, specific performance and other equitable relief when expressly
available pursuant to the terms of this Agreement on the basis that the other
Parties have an adequate remedy at Law or an award of specific performance is
not an appropriate remedy for any reason at Law or equity.

Section 10.17 _Time of Essence_. With regard to all dates and time periods
set forth or referred to in this Agreement, time is of the essence.

Section 10.18 _Further Assurances_. Following the Closing, as and when
requested by any Party and at such Partys expense, any other Party shall
execute and deliver, or cause to be executed and delivered, all such documents
and instruments and shall take, or cause to be taken, all such further or
other actions as such other Party may reasonably deem necessary to evidence
and effectuate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

 

Section 10.19 _Contributor Guarantor_.

 

(a) Contributor Guarantor hereby absolutely, unconditionally and irrevocably
guarantees to the Acquiror Parties the due, full and punctual payment and
performance of all covenants, obligations, liabilities and agreements of
Contributors hereunder (the " _Guaranteed_

 



58   _Obligations_ "), subject to the terms and conditions hereunder. If, for
any reason whatsoever, Contributors shall fail or be unable to duly,
punctually and fully pay or perform the Guaranteed Obligations, Contributor
Guarantor will forthwith pay and cause to be paid in lawful currency of the
United States, or perform or cause to be performed, the Guaranteed
Obligations. The foregoing obligation of Contributor Guarantor constitutes a
continuing guarantee of payment and performance, and is and shall be absolute
and unconditional under any and all circumstances, including circumstances
which might otherwise constitute a legal or equitable discharge of a guarantor
and including any amendment, extension, modification or waiver of any of the
Guaranteed Obligations or any insolvency, bankruptcy, liquidation or
dissolution of Contributors or any assignment thereby. Contributor Guarantor
hereby irrevocably waives (to the fullest extent permitted by applicable Law)
notice of acceptance of this guaranty and notice of any liability to which it
may apply, and waives promptness, diligence, presentment, demand or payment,
protest, notice of dishonor or nonpayment, suit, filing objections with a
court, any right to require proceeding first against Contributors (including
initiating a Proceeding against Contributors), any right to require the prior
disposition of the assets of Contributors to meet any of its obligations
hereunder or the taking of any other action by the Acquiror Group and all
demands whatsoever. The guaranty set forth in this _Section 10.19(a)_ will
remain in full force and effect, and will be binding upon
Contributor Guarantor, until all of the Guaranteed Obligations have been
satisfied.

(b) Contributor Guarantor hereby represents and warrants to the Acquiror
Parties that:

(i) Contributor Guarantor is a limited partnership duly organized, validly
existing and in good standing under the Laws of its jurisdiction of
organization;

(ii) Contributor Guarantor has all requisite limited partnership power and
authority and has taken all limited partnership action necessary in order to
execute, deliver and perform its obligations under this Agreement;

(iii) No material notices to, filings with, or authorizations, consents or
approvals of any Governmental Entity are necessary for the execution, delivery
or performance of this Agreement. Neither the execution, delivery and
performance by Contributor Guarantor of this Agreement nor the consummation
by Contributor Guarantor of the transactions contemplated thereby will (A)
conflict with or result in any breach of any provision of Contributor
Guarantors Governing Documents, (B) result in a violation or breach of, or
cause acceleration, or constitute (with or without due notice or lapse of time
or both) a default (or give rise to any right of termination, cancellation or
acceleration) under any of the terms, conditions or provisions of any
material Contract to which Contributor Guarantor is a party, other than
violations, breaches, accelerations or defaults which would not, or would not
be reasonably likely to, have a material effect on Contributors ability to
execute, deliver and perform its obligations under this Agreement or (C)
violate any material Law or Order of any Governmental Entity applicable to
Contributor Guarantor or any of its properties or assets; and

 

(iv) This Agreement has been duly executed and delivered by Contributor
Guarantor and is a valid and binding agreement of Contributor Guarantor,
enforceable against it in accordance with its terms, subject to applicable
bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium or other laws affecting
generally the enforcement of creditors rights and subject to general
principles of equity.

WHEREAS, pursuant to Section 13.3(c) of the Partnership Agreement, if the
General Partner determines that an amendment does not satisfy the

other classes of Partnership Interests, in any material respect, such
amendment shall only be required to be approved by the adversely affected

__WHEREAS, in connection with the transactions contemplated by the

agreed to receive units of a new class of Partnership Interests to be
designated as "Class B Units" as partial consideration for the contribution by

to the Partnership; and

WHEREAS, the General Partner has determined that the creation of the new

interests of the Partnership and beneficial to the Limited Partners, including
the holders of the Common Units; and

WHEREAS, Stripes LLC and Stripes 1009, in their capacities as Limited Partners
holding all of the outstanding Subordinated Units, have consented to and
approved this Amendment No. 2, including without limitation the provisions

connection with the creation, authorization and issuance of the issuance of

set forth herein are necessary or advisable to reflect, account for and deal
with appropriately the investment by the Partnership in any corporation,
partnership, joint venture, limited liability company or other entity other

WHEREAS, the General Partner has determined that, pursuant to Section 13.3(c)
of the Partnership Agreement, to the extent that the amendments providing for
the SUN Interest Conversion and setting forth the terms of the Class A Units
adversely affect the Subordinated Units as a class of Partnership Interests

respect, such amendments shall only be required to be approved by the holders

     | c. | Article V of the Partnership Agreement is hereby amended by
adding a new Section 5.13 at the end thereof as follows: 
---|---|--- 
 

 __"5.13 _Establishment of Class B Units_. __

Units to be designated as "Class B Units" and initially consisting of a total

(b) _Conversion_.

 

(i) All Class B Units shall automatically convert into Common Units on a one-
for-one basis (subject to adjustment in Section 5.9 in the event of any
split-up, combination or similar event affecting the Common Units or other
Units that occurs prior to the Class B Conversion Effective Date) on the first
Business Day following the Record Date for the distribution for the Quarter
ended June 30, 2015 (the " _Class B Conversion Effective Date_ ") without any
further action by the holders thereof. The terms of the Class B Units shall be
changed, automatically and without further action, on the Class B Conversion
Effective Date so that each Class B Unit is converted into one Common Unit
and, immediately thereafter, none of the Class B Units shall be Outstanding;
_provided_ , _however_ , that such converted Class B Units will remain
subject to the provisions of Section 5.13(b)(ii) and Section 6.1(d)(x).

 



5 (ii) Subject to the provisions of Section 5.13(b)(iii) _,_ immediately prior
to the transfer of a Class B Unit that has converted into a Common Unit by the
holder thereof (other than a transfer to an Affiliate unless the General
Partner elects to have this subparagraph apply), the Capital Account

be transferred in an amount equal to the product of (a) the number of
converted Class B Units to be transferred and (b) the Per Unit Capital
Account for a Common Unit, and (Y) second, any remaining balance in such
Capital Account will be retained by the transferor. Following any such
allocation, the transferors Capital Account, if any, maintained with respect
to the retained converted Class B Units, if any, will have a balance equal to
the amount allocated under clause (Y) above, and the transferees Capital
Account established with respect to the transferred converted Class B Units
will have a balance equal to the amount allocated under clause (X) above.

(iii) A Unitholder holding a Common Unit issued upon conversion of a Class B
Unit pursuant to Section 5.13(b) shall not be issued a Common Unit Certificate
pursuant to Section 4.1, if the Common Units are evidenced by Certificates,
and shall not be permitted to transfer such Common Units until such time as
the General Partner determines, based on advice of counsel, that the Common
Unit issued upon conversion of such Class B Unit should have, as a substantive
matter, like intrinsic economic and federal income tax characteristics of an
Initial Common Unit. In connection with the condition imposed by this Section
5.13(b)(iii), General Partner shall take whatever steps are required to
provide economic uniformity to the Common Units issued upon conversion of
Class B Units in preparation for a transfer of such Common Units, including
application of Section 5.13(b)(ii) and Section 6.1(d)(x)(D).

 

(c) _Allocations_. Except as otherwise provided in this Agreement, during the
period commencing upon issuance of the Class B Units and ending on the Class
B Conversion Effective Date, all items of Partnership income, gain, loss,
deduction and credit, including Unrealized Gain or Unrealized Loss, shall be
allocated to the Class B Units to the same extent as such items would be so
allocated if such Class B Units were Common Units that were then Outstanding.

(d) _Distributions_. Prior to the Class B Conversion Effective Date, the
Class B Units shall not be entitled to receive distributions of Available Cash
pursuant to Sections 6.4 or 6.5.

 

(e) _Voting_. The Class B Units will have such voting rights pursuant to the
Agreement as such Class B Units would have if they were Common Units that
were then Outstanding and shall vote together with the Common Units as a
single class, except that the Class B Units shall be entitled to vote as a
separate class on any matter on which Unitholders are entitled to vote that
adversely affects the rights or preferences of the Class B Units in relation
to other classes of Partnership Interests in any material respect or as
required by law. The approval of a majority of the Class B Units shall be
required to approve any matter for which the holders of the Class B Units are
entitled to vote as a separate class.

 



6 (f) _Certificates._ The Class B Units shall not be evidenced by certificates
and, subject to Section 5.13(b)(iii) and the satisfaction of any applicable
legal and regulatory requirements, may be assigned or transferred in a manner
identical to the assignment and transfer of Common Units.

 

(g) _Registrar and Transfer Agent_. Unless and until the General Partner
determines to assign the responsibility to another Person, the General
Partner shall act as the Transfer Agent for the Class B Units.

(h) _Surrender of Certificates_. Subject to the requirements of Section
5.13(b)(iii), on or after the Class B Conversion Effective Date, the
Partnership shall, as soon as practicable thereafter, issue and deliver at the
office of the General Partner to such holder of Class B Units one or more
Common Unit Certificates, registered in the name of such holder, or other
evidence of the issuance of uncertificated certificates, for the number of
Common Units to which such holder shall be entitled. Such conversion shall be
deemed to have been made as of the Class B Conversion Effective Date, and the
Person entitled to receive the Common Units issuable upon such conversion
shall be treated for all purposes as the record holder of such Common
Units as of such date.



     | d. | Section 6.1(c) of the Partnership Agreement is hereby amended
to add the following proviso at the end of such section: 
---|---|--- 
 

"; _provided, however_ , that in no event shall the allocations of Net
Termination Gain or Net Termination Loss result in the distribution of any
items derived from or attributable to Propco Available Cash to a holder of
Class A Units pursuant to Section 12.4(c) and the General Partner may adjust
the allocations of Net Termination Gain or Net Termination Loss to avoid such
result."



     | e. | Section 6.1(d)(iii)(A) of the Partnership Agreement is hereby
amended read as follows: 
---|---|--- 
 

"(A) If the amount of cash or the Net Agreed Value of any property distributed
(except for distributions of Propco Available Cash pursuant to Section 6.10
and cash or property distributed pursuant to Section 12.4) with respect to a
Unit for a taxable period exceeds the amount of cash or the Net Agreed Value
of property distributed with respect to another Unit within the same taxable
period (the amount of the excess, and "Excess Distribution" and the Units with
respect to which the greater distribution is paid, an "Excess Distribution
Unit"), then there shall be allocated gross income and gain to each
Unitholder receiving an Excess Distribution with respect to the Excess
Distribution Unit until the aggregate amount of such items allocated with
respect to such Excess Distribution Unit pursuant to this Section
6.1(d)(iii)(A) for the current and all previous taxable periods is equal to
the amount of the Excess Distribution; _provided, however_ , this _Section
6.1(d)(iii)(A)_ shall not apply to the extent distributions are not made to
the Class B Units with respect to any Record Date prior to the Class B
Conversion Effective Date."

 



7 to add a new Section 6.1(d)(xv) as follows: 
---|---|--- 
 

"(xv) _Allocations of Propco Items_. All Propco Items shall, to the maximum
extent possible, be allocated to the holders of the Common Units,
Subordinated Units and Class B Units, Pro Rata.



     | g. | Section 6.1(d)(x) of the Partnership Agreement shall be
amended to add Section 6.1(d)(x)(D) which shall read as follows and to
renumber existing Section 6.1(d)(x)(D) as Section 6.1(d)(x)(E):  
---|---|--- 

"With respect to any taxable period in which the Class B Conversion Effective
Date occurs (and, if necessary, any subsequent taxable period), items of
Partnership gross income, gain, deduction or loss for the taxable period shall
be allocated 100% to each Limited Partner with respect to such Limited
Partners Class B Units that are Outstanding immediately before the Class B
Conversion Effective Date in the proportion that the respective number of
Class B Units held by such Partner bears to the total number of Class B Units
then Outstanding, until each such Partner has been allocated the amount
of gross income, gain, deduction or loss with respect to such Partners Class
B Units that causes the Capital Account attributable to each Class B Unit, on
a per Unit basis, to equal the Per Unit Capital Amount for a Common Unit on
the Class B Conversion Effective Date. The purpose for this allocation is to
establish uniformity between the Capital Accounts underlying converted Class B
Units and the Capital Accounts underlying Common Units immediately prior to
the conversion of Class B Units into Common Units."



     | h. | Section 6.4(a) of the Partnership Agreement is hereby amended
and restated to read in its entirety: 
---|---|--- 
 

 _"During Subordination Period_. Available Cash (other than Propco Available
Cash which shall be distributed in accordance with Section 6.10) with respect
to any Quarter wholly within the Subordination Period that is deemed to be
Operating Surplus pursuant to the provisions of Section 6.3 or 6.5 shall be
distributed as follows, except as otherwise contemplated by Section 5.6(b) in
respect of other Partnership Interests issued pursuant thereto:

(i) First, to all Unitholders holding Common Units, Pro Rata, until there has
been distributed in respect of each Common Unit then Outstanding an amount
equal to the Minimum Quarterly Distribution for such Quarter;

 

(ii) Second, to all Unitholders holding Common Units, Pro Rata, until there
has been distributed in respect of each Common Unit then Outstanding an
amount equal to the Cumulative Common Unit Arrearage existing with respect to

respect of each Unit then Outstanding an amount equal to the excess of the
First Target Distribution over the Minimum Quarterly Distribution for such
Quarter;

(v) Fifth, (A) 15.0% to the holders of the Incentive Distribution Rights, Pro
Rata; and (B) 85.0% to all Unitholders, Pro Rata, until there has been
distributed in respect of each Unit then Outstanding an amount equal to the
