                          AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER

          This AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER, dated as of March 3, 2006 (this
"Agreement"), is by and between EM Acquisition Corporation, a Pennsylvania
corporation ("Merger Co"), and Education Management Corporation, a Pennsylvania
corporation (the "Company").

                                    RECITALS

          A. The respective Boards of Directors of each of the Company and
Merger Co deem it in the best interests of their respective companies and
shareholders to consummate the merger (the "Merger"), on the terms and subject
to the conditions set forth in this Agreement, of Merger Co with and into the
Company, and such Boards of Directors have approved this Agreement and declared
its advisability (and, in the case of the Board of Directors of the Company (the
"Company Board"), unanimously recommended that this Agreement be adopted by the
Company's shareholders).

          B. Upon consummation of the Merger, each issued and outstanding share
of common stock, par value $.01 per share, of the Company (the "Company Common
Stock"), will be converted into the right to receive $43 per share in cash, upon
the terms and subject to the conditions of this Agreement.

          C. Certain capitalized terms used in this Agreement that are not
otherwise defined in context are defined in Section 9.03(a).

          NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing and of the
representations, warranties, covenants, and agreements contained herein, and
intending to be legally bound hereby, Merger Co and the Company hereby agree as
follows:

                                    ARTICLE 1

                                   THE MERGER

          1.01 The Merger. Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set
forth in Article 7, and in accordance with the Pennsylvania Business Corporation
Law of 1988, as amended (the "PBCL"), at the Effective Time, Merger Co shall be
merged with and into the Company. At the Effective Time, the separate corporate
existence of Merger Co shall cease and the Company shall continue as the
surviving corporation of the Merger (the "Surviving Corporation") and shall
succeed to and assume all the rights and obligations of Merger Co in accordance
with the PBCL.

          1.02 Closing. Unless this Agreement shall have been terminated in
accordance with Section 8.01, and subject to the satisfaction or waiver of the
conditions set forth in Article 7, the closing of the Merger (the "Closing")
will take place at 10:00 a.m., New York time, on the Business Day immediately
following the satisfaction or waiver of the conditions set forth in Article 7
(other than those that by their terms are to be satisfied or waived at the
Closing) that is the earlier of (a) a date during the Marketing Period to be
specified by Merger Co on no less than three Business Days' notice to the
Company and (b) the final day of the Marketing Period, at the


                                       -1-

<PAGE>

offices of Simpson Thacher & Bartlett LLP, 425 Lexington Avenue, New York, New
York, unless another time, date, and/or place is agreed to in writing by Merger
Co and the Company (the "Closing Date"); provided, however, that if the Closing
does not occur on or before the tenth (10th) day of any month, the Closing shall
occur on the first Business Day of the subsequent month.

          1.03 Effective Time. Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set
forth in this Agreement, on the Closing Date, the parties hereto shall (a) file
articles of merger (the "Articles of Merger") executed and acknowledged in
accordance with the relevant provisions of the PBCL and (b) make all other
filings or recordings required under the PBCL to effect the Merger. The Merger
shall become effective at such date and time as the Articles of Merger are duly
filed with the Secretary of State of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, or at
such subsequent date and time as Merger Co and the Company shall agree and
specify in the Articles of Merger. The date and time at which the Merger becomes
effective is referred to in this Agreement as the "Effective Time".

          1.04 Effect of the Merger. At the Effective Time, the effect of the
Merger shall be as provided in Section 1929 of the PBCL.

          1.05 Articles of Incorporation; Bylaws.

          (a) The Articles of Merger shall provide that, at the Effective Time,
the Articles of Incorporation of the Company, as in effect immediately prior to
the Effective Time, shall be the Articles of Incorporation of the Surviving
Corporation until thereafter amended in accordance with the provisions thereof
and as provided by Law.

          (b) At the Effective Time, the Bylaws of Merger Co, as in effect
immediately prior to the Effective Time, shall be the Bylaws of the Surviving
Corporation until thereafter amended as provided by Law and the Articles of
Incorporation and the Bylaws of the Surviving Corporation.

          1.06 Directors. The directors of Merger Co immediately prior to the
Effective Time shall be the initial directors of the Surviving Corporation, each
to hold office in accordance with the Articles of Incorporation and Bylaws of
the Surviving Corporation, until their respective successors are duly elected or
appointed and qualified or until the earlier of their death, resignation, or
removal.

                                   ARTICLE 2

               CONVERSION OF SECURITIES; EXCHANGE OF CERTIFICATES

          2.01 Conversion of Securities. At the Effective Time, by virtue of the
Merger and without any action on the part of Merger Co, the Company, or the
holders of any of the following securities:

          (a) Conversion of Company Common Stock. Each share of Company Common
Stock (all issued and outstanding shares of Company Common Stock collectively
referred to as the "Shares") issued and outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time (other than any


                                       -2-

<PAGE>

Shares to be cancelled pursuant to Section 2.01(b) and Shares owned by
Subsidiaries of the Company), including Shares subject to restrictions or
forfeiture conditions relating to time, performance, or otherwise (the
"Restricted Shares"), shall be cancelled and shall be converted automatically
into the right to receive $43 in cash, without interest (the "Merger
Consideration"), payable upon surrender of the certificate that formerly
evidenced such Share in the manner provided in Section 2.02.

          (b) Cancellation of Treasury Stock and Merger Co Owned Stock. Each
Share held in the treasury of the Company and each Share owned by Merger Co or
any direct or indirect Subsidiary of Merger Co immediately prior to the
Effective Time shall automatically be cancelled without any conversion thereof,
and no payment or distribution shall be made with respect thereto.

          (c) Capital Stock of Merger Co. Each share of common stock, par value
$.01 per share, of Merger Co issued and outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time shall be converted into and become one validly issued, fully
paid, and nonassessable share of common stock, par value $.01 per share, of the
Surviving Corporation. Following the Effective Time, each certificate evidencing
ownership of shares of Merger Co common stock shall evidence ownership of such
shares of the Surviving Corporation.

          (d) Adjustments. If, between the date of this Agreement and the
Effective Time, there is a reclassification, recapitalization, stock split,
stock dividend, subdivision, combination or exchange of shares with respect to,
or rights issued in respect of, the Shares, the Merger Consideration shall be
adjusted accordingly, without duplication, to provide the holders of Shares the
same economic effect as contemplated by this Agreement prior to such event.

          2.02 Exchange of Certificates.

          (a) Paying Agent. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall (i)
appoint and designate Mellon Investor Services LLC or a bank or trust company
reasonably acceptable to Merger Co as the paying agent (the "Paying Agent") and
(ii) enter into a paying agent agreement with such Paying Agent for the payment
of the Merger Consideration in accordance with this Article 2. At the Effective
Time, the Surviving Corporation shall deposit with the Paying Agent, for the
benefit of the holders of Shares, cash in an amount sufficient to pay the
aggregate Merger Consideration required to be paid pursuant to Section 2.01(a)
(such cash amount referred to as the "Exchange Fund"). The Exchange Fund shall
not be used for any other purpose. The Exchange Fund shall be invested by the
Paying Agent as directed by the Surviving Corporation; provided, however, that
such investments shall be in obligations of or guaranteed by the United States
of America or any agency or instrumentality thereof and backed by the full faith
and credit of the United States of America, in commercial paper obligations
rated A-1 or P-1 or better by Moody's Investors Service, Inc. or Standard &
Poor's Corporation, respectively, or in certificates of deposit, bank repurchase
agreements, or banker's acceptances of commercial banks with capital exceeding
$1 billion (based on the most recent financial statements of such bank which are
then publicly available). Any net profit resulting from, or interest or income
produced by, such investments shall be payable to the Surviving Corporation.


                                       -3-

<PAGE>

          (b) Exchange Procedures. As promptly as practicable after the
Effective Time (but no later than ten Business Days after the Effective Time),
the Surviving Corporation shall cause the Paying Agent to mail to each person
who was, at the Effective Time, a holder of record of Shares entitled to receive
the Merger Consideration pursuant to Section 2.01(a): (i) a letter of
transmittal (which shall be in customary form and containing customary terms and
shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the
certificate(s) evidencing such Shares (the "Certificates") shall pass, only upon
proper delivery of the Certificates, to the Paying Agent) and (ii) instructions
for use in effecting the surrender of the Certificates in exchange for the
Merger Consideration. Upon surrender to the Paying Agent of a Certificate for
cancellation, together with such letter of transmittal, duly completed, and
validly executed in accordance with the instructions thereto, and such other
documents as may be required pursuant to such instructions, the holder of such
Certificate shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor the Merger
Consideration that such holder has the right to receive in respect of the Shares
formerly represented by such Certificate pursuant to Section 2.01(a), and the
Certificate so surrendered shall forthwith be cancelled. In the event of a
transfer of ownership of Shares that is not registered in the transfer records
of the Company, payment of the Merger Consideration may be made to a person
other than the person in whose name the Certificate so surrendered is registered
if the Certificate representing such Shares shall be properly endorsed or
otherwise be in proper form for transfer, and the person requesting such payment
shall pay any transfer or other taxes required by reason of the payment of the
Merger Consideration to a person other than the registered holder of such
Certificate or establish to the reasonable satisfaction of the Surviving
Corporation that such tax has been paid or is not applicable. Until surrendered
as contemplated by this Section 2.02, each Certificate shall be deemed at all
times after the Effective Time to represent only the right to receive upon such
surrender the Merger Consideration to which the holder of such Certificate is
entitled pursuant to this Article 2. No interest shall be paid or will accrue on
any cash payable to holders of Certificates pursuant to the provisions of this
Article 2.

          (c) No Further Rights. From and after the Effective Time, holders of
Certificates shall cease to have any rights as shareholders of the Company,
except as provided herein or by applicable Law.

          (d) Termination of Exchange Fund. Any portion of the Exchange Fund
that remains undistributed to the holders of Shares for one year after the
Effective Time shall be delivered to the Surviving Corporation, upon demand, and
any holders of Shares who have not theretofore complied with this Article 2
shall thereafter look only to the Surviving Corporation for, and the Surviving
Corporation shall remain liable for, payment of their claim for the Merger
Consideration. Any portion of the Exchange Fund remaining unclaimed by holders
of Shares as of a date which is immediately prior to such time as such amounts
would otherwise escheat to or become property of any Governmental Entity shall,
to the extent permitted by applicable Law, become the property of the Surviving
Corporation free and clear of any claims or interest of any person previously
entitled thereto.

          (e) No Liability. None of the Paying Agent, Merger Co, or the
Surviving Corporation shall be liable to any holder of Shares for any such
Shares (or dividends or distributions with respect thereto), or cash delivered
to a public official pursuant to any abandoned property, escheat, or similar
Law.


                                       -4-

<PAGE>

          (f) Withholding Rights. Each of the Paying Agent, the Surviving
Corporation, and Merger Co shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the
consideration otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement to any holder of
Shares such amounts as it is required to deduct and withhold with respect to
such payment under all applicable Tax Laws and pay such withholding amount over
to the appropriate taxing authority. To the extent that amounts are so properly
withheld by the Paying Agent, the Surviving Corporation, or Merger Co, as the
case may be, such withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this
Agreement as having been paid to the holder of the Shares in respect of which
such deduction and withholding was made by the Paying Agent, the Surviving
Corporation, or Merger Co, as the case may be.

          (g) Lost Certificates. If any Certificate shall have been lost,
stolen, or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the person
claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen, or destroyed, and, if reasonably
required by the Surviving Corporation, the posting by such person of a bond, in
such reasonable and customary amount as the Surviving Corporation may direct, as
indemnity against any claim that may be made against it with respect to such
Certificate, the Paying Agent shall pay in respect of such lost, stolen, or
destroyed Certificate, the Merger Consideration to which the holder thereof is
entitled pursuant to Section 2.01(a).

          2.03 Stock Transfer Books. At the Effective Time, the stock transfer
books of the Company shall be closed and there shall be no further registration
of transfers of Shares thereafter on the records of the Company. From and after
the Effective Time, the holders of Certificates representing Shares outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall cease to have any rights with
respect to such Shares, except as otherwise provided in this Agreement or by
Law. On or after the Effective Time, any Certificates presented to the Paying
Agent or Merger Co for any reason shall be cancelled against delivery of the
Merger Consideration to which the holders thereof are entitled pursuant to
Section 2.01(a).

          2.04 Company Stock Options.

          (a) Immediately prior to the Effective Time, all options then
outstanding to purchase shares of Company Common Stock (the "Company Stock
Options") granted under any plan, arrangement, or agreement set forth in Section
3.13(a) of the Company Disclosure Schedule (collectively, the "Company Stock
Option Plans") shall become fully vested and exercisable (whether or not then
vested or subject to any time or performance condition that has not been
satisfied). At the Effective Time, each Company Stock Option not previously
exercised shall be cancelled and converted into the right to receive, as
promptly as practicable thereafter (and in any event within ten Business Days),
an amount of cash (without interest) (the "Option Amount") equal to the product
of (i) the total number of shares of Company Common Stock subject to such
Company Stock Option multiplied by (ii) the excess of the amount of the per
share Merger Consideration over the exercise price per share of Company Common
Stock under such Company Stock Option (with the aggregate amount of such payment
rounded to the nearest cent) less applicable Taxes, if any, required to be
withheld with respect to such payment. In the event the amount of the per share
Merger Consideration over the exercise price per share of the Company Common
Stock is zero or a negative number with respect to any Company Stock Option, the
holder of such Company Stock Option shall receive no payment in connection with
the cancellation of such Company Stock Option under this Agreement. After the
Effective Time, any Company Stock Option cancelled in accordance with this
Section 2.04(a) shall no longer be


                                       -5-

<PAGE>

exercisable by the former holder thereof, but shall only entitle such holder to
the payment described in this Section 2.04(a).

          (b) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company Board, or, where
appropriate, the applicable administrative committee under each Company Stock
Option Plan and the ESPP, shall take all actions reasonably necessary and
appropriate (including the adoption of any necessary resolutions, plan
amendments, and/or the obtaining of any necessary consents) to make such
adjustments and amendments to, or make such determinations with respect to, the
Company Stock Option Plans and Company Stock Options to implement the foregoing
provisions of this Section 2.04 and the provisions of Section 6.06(e), including
the cancellation, subject to and effective on and as of the Effective Time, of
all Company Stock Options without further obligation of the Company or its
Affiliates (other than payment of the Option Amount pursuant to Section 2.04).

          2.05 No Dissenters' Rights. In accordance with Section 1571 of the
PBCL, holders of Shares shall not have the right to dissent in connection with
the Merger or the Other Transactions.

                                    ARTICLE 3

                  REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF THE COMPANY

          Except as set forth in the disclosure schedule delivered by the
Company to Merger Co prior to or concurrently with the execution and delivery of
this Agreement (the "Company Disclosure Schedule"), which Company Disclosure
Schedule identifies the section (or if applicable, the subsection) to which such
exception relates (provided, that disclosure of any fact or item in any section
or subsection of the Company Disclosure Schedule shall, should the existence of
such fact or item be relevant to any other section or subsection, be deemed to
be disclosed with respect to that other section or subsection so long as the
relevance of such disclosure to such other section or subsection is reasonably
apparent from the nature of such disclosure), the Company hereby represents and
warrants to Merger Co as follows:

          3.01 Organization and Qualification; Subsidiaries.

          (a) Except as set forth in Section 3.01(a) of the Company Disclosure
Schedule, the Company and each Subsidiary of the Company is a corporation,
limited partnership, or limited liability company (as applicable) duly
organized, validly subsisting or existing, and in good standing under the laws
of the jurisdiction of its organization and has the requisite power and
authority to own, lease, and operate its properties and to carry on its business
as it is now being conducted, except where the failure to be so organized,
subsisting or existing, or in good standing or to have such power and authority
would not have a Company Material Adverse Effect. Each of the Company and each
Subsidiary is duly qualified or licensed as a foreign corporation, limited
partnership, or limited liability company (as applicable) to do business, and is
in good standing, in each jurisdiction where the character of the properties
owned, leased, or operated by it or the nature of its business makes such
qualification or licensing necessary, except where the failure to be so
qualified or licensed and in good standing would not have a Company Material
Adverse Effect.


                                       -6-

<PAGE>

          (b) A true and complete list of all Subsidiaries of the Company,
together with the jurisdiction of organization of each Subsidiary of the Company
and the percentage of the outstanding capital stock (or other equity interest)
of each Subsidiary of the Company owned by the Company, each other Subsidiary of
the Company, and any other person, is set forth in Section 3.01(b) of the
Company Disclosure Schedule.

          (c) Section 3.01(c) of the Company Disclosure Schedule lists any and
all persons of which the Company directly or indirectly owns an equity or
similar interest, or an interest convertible into or exchangeable or exercisable
for an equity or similar interest, of less than 50% (collectively, the
"Investments"). Except as set forth in Section 3.01(c) of the Company Disclosure
Schedule, the Company or one of its Subsidiaries, as the case may be, owns all
Investments free and clear of all Liens, and there are no outstanding
contractual obligations of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries permitting the
repurchase, redemption or other acquisition of any of its interest in the
Investments or requiring the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to provide funds
to, make any investment (in the form of a loan, capital contribution or
otherwise) in, provide any guarantee with respect to, or assume, endorse or
otherwise become responsible for the obligations of, any Investment.

          3.02 Articles of Incorporation and Bylaws. The Company has made
available to Merger Co a complete and correct copy of the Articles of
Incorporation and the Bylaws (or similar organizational documents), each as
amended to date, of the Company and each Subsidiary. Such Articles of
Incorporation and Bylaws (or similar organizational documents) are in full force
and effect as of the date hereof. Neither the Company nor any Subsidiary set
forth on Section 3.02 of the Company Disclosure Schedule (each a "Material
Subsidiary") is in violation of any of the provisions of its Articles of
Incorporation or Bylaws (or similar organizational documents). No Subsidiary of
the Company (other than the Material Subsidiaries, which are subject to the
immediately preceding sentence) is in violation of any of the provisions of its
Articles of Incorporation or Bylaws (or similar organizational documents),
except for violations that would not have a Company Material Adverse Effect. The
Company has made available to Merger Co complete and correct copies of the
minutes of all meetings of the Company Board (and each committee thereof) (other
than the portion of any minutes regarding the deliberations of the Company Board
(or any committee thereof) in connection with entering into this Agreement or
pursuing other strategic alternatives or that would be reasonably expected to
violate or result in the loss or impairment of any attorney-client or
work-product privilege), and of the shareholders of the Company, in each case
since January 1, 2002.

          (a) Section 3.13(a) of the Company Disclosure Schedule lists all
material employee benefit plans (as defined in Section 3(3) of the Employee
Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended ("ERISA")) and all bonus,
stock option, stock purchase, restricted stock, incentive, deferred
compensation, retiree medical or life insurance, supplemental retirement,
severance (other than Contracts with individual members of the faculty of the
Schools), consulting, change-in-control, collective bargaining, termination, or
other benefit plans, programs, arrangements and material Contracts to which the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries is a party (whether legally binding or not
and whether subject to ERISA or not), which are maintained, contributed to or
sponsored by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries for the benefit of any
current or former employee, consultant, officer or director of the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries (each, a "Company Employee") or pursuant to which the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries has or may reasonably be expected to have any
material obligations or material liabilities of any nature (whether direct,
indirect, accrued, absolute, contingent,


                                      -18-

<PAGE>

determined or determinable, matured or unmatured or otherwise). All such plans,
programs, arrangements and Contracts, whether material or not, shall be
collectively referred to as the "Plans". The Company has made available to
Merger Co a true and complete copy (where applicable) of (A) each Plan (or,
where a Plan has not been reduced to writing, a summary of all material Plan
terms of such Plan), (B) each trust or funding arrangement prepared in
connection with each such Plan, (C) the three most recently filed annual reports

most recently prepared actuarial reports and financial statements in connection

written communications (or a description of any material oral communications) by
the Company or its Subsidiaries to any Company Employee concerning the extent of
the benefits provided under a Plan.

          (b) None of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or any other person
or entity that, together with the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, is or was
treated as a single employer under Section 414(b), (c), (m) or (o) of the Code
(each, together with the Company and any of its Subsidiaries, an "ERISA
Affiliate") has now or at any time within the past six years (and in the case of
any such other person or entity, only during the period within the past six
years that such other person or entity was an ERISA Affiliate) contributed to,
sponsored, or maintained: (i) a pension plan (within the meaning of Section 3(2)
of ERISA) subject to Section 412 of the Code or Title IV of ERISA; (ii) a
multiemployer plan (within the meaning of Section 3(37) or 4001(a)(3) of ERISA)
(a "Multiemployer Plan"); or (iii) a single employer pension plan (within the
meaning of Section 4001(a)(15) of ERISA) for which an ERISA Affiliate would

Plan"). Except as set forth in Section 3.13(b) of the Company Disclosure
Schedule (each, a "Change in Control Agreement"), no Plan exists that would
result in the payment to any Company Employee of any money or other property or
accelerate or provide any other rights or benefits to any Company Employee as a
result of the consummation of the Merger or any other transaction contemplated
by this Agreement (whether alone or in connection with any other event). Except
as set forth in Section 3.13(b) of the Company Disclosure Schedule, there is no
Plan covering any Company Employee that, individually or collectively, would
give rise to the payment of any amount that would not be deductible pursuant to
the terms of Section 280G or Section 162(m) of the United States Internal
Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code").

          (c) Each Plan that is intended to be qualified under Section 401(a) of
the Code has received a favorable determination letter from the IRS covering all
of the material provisions applicable to the Plan for which determination
letters are currently available that the Plan is so qualified, and each trust
established in connection with any Plan which is intended to be exempt from
federal income taxation under Section 501(a) of the Code has received a
determination letter from the IRS that it is so exempt, and, to the Knowledge of
the Company, no fact or circumstance exists that would result in the revocation
of such letter.

          (d) Each Plan has been established and administered in accordance with
its terms, and in compliance with the applicable provisions of ERISA, the Code
and other applicable Laws, except to the extent such noncompliance would not
have a Company Material Adverse Effect,


                                      -19-

<PAGE>

and except as set forth in Section 3.13(d) of the Company Disclosure Schedule,
no Plan provides post-termination or retiree welfare benefits, and neither the
Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has any obligation to provide any
post-termination or retiree welfare benefits other than health care continuation
as required by Section 4980B of the Code.

          (e) All contributions (including all employer contributions and
employee salary reduction contributions) that are due have been made to each
pension plan (as defined in Section 3(2) of ERISA), and to the extent not due
have been appropriately accrued on the financial statements described in Section
3.09 in accordance with GAAP. All premiums or other payments which are due have
been paid with respect to each welfare plan or fringe benefit plan, and to the
extent such amounts are owed with respect to periods prior to the Closing Date
but are not yet payable, have been appropriately accrued on the financial
statements described in Section 3.09 in accordance with GAAP.

          (f) Each plan that is a "non-qualified deferred compensation plan" (as
defined in Section 409A(d)(1) of the Code) and is otherwise subject to the
requirements of Section 409A of the Code (together with the guidance and
proposed regulations promulgated thereunder, "Section 409A") has been operated
and administered in good faith compliance in all material respects with Section
409A since January 1, 2005.

          (g) Except as set forth in Section 3.13(g) of the Company Disclosure
Schedule, with respect to any Plan, (i) no Actions (other than routine claims
for benefits in the ordinary course) are pending or, to the Knowledge of the
Company, threatened, except for those that would not be material to the Company,
(ii) to the Knowledge of the Company, no facts or circumstances exist that would
give rise to any such Actions, and (iii) no administrative investigation, audit
or other administrative proceeding by the Department of Labor, the IRS, or other
Governmental Entity, is pending, in progress or, to the Knowledge of the
Company, threatened, except for those that would not be material to the Company.

          (h) With respect to each Plan that is not subject to United States Law
(a "Foreign Benefit Plan"), except as set forth in Section 3.13(h) of the
Company Disclosure Schedule or as would not have a Company Material Adverse
Effect: (i) all employer and employee contributions to each Foreign Benefit Plan
required by Law or by the terms of such Foreign Benefit Plan have been made or,
if applicable, accrued in accordance with normal accounting practices; (ii) the
fair market value of the assets of each funded Foreign Benefit Plan, the
liability of each insurer for any Foreign Benefit Plan funded through insurance
or the book reserve established for any Foreign Benefit Plan, together with any
accrued contributions, is sufficient to procure or provide for the accrued
benefit obligations with respect to all current and former participants in such
plan, according to the actuarial assumptions and valuations most recently used
and consistent with applicable Law and normal accounting practices to determine
employer contributions to such Foreign Benefit Plan, and no transaction
contemplated by this Agreement shall cause such assets, reserve or insurance
obligations to be less than such benefit obligations; (iii) each Foreign Benefit
Plan required to be registered has been registered and has been maintained in
good standing with applicable regulatory authorities; and (iv) each Foreign
Benefit Plan is in compliance in all material respects with all applicable Laws.

There are no material unfair labor practice complaints pending against the
Company or any of its Material Subsidiaries before the National Labor Relations

restrictions, conditions, setbacks, encroachments, gaps and gores, and other
imperfections of title, that are typical for the applicable property type and
locality, none of which, individually or in the aggregate, materially impairs
the use, value or operations of the affected property or materially interferes
with the conduct of the business of the Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a
whole, as presently conducted, (collectively, "Permitted Liens"). Copies of
title insurance policies obtained by the Company for each parcel of Owned Real
Property have been made available to Merger Co to the extent existing and

Company or one of its Subsidiaries party thereto or, to the Company's Knowledge,
by any other party thereto and, to the Company's Knowledge, no event has
occurred that, with the lapse of time or the giving of notice or both, would
constitute a material default by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
thereunder.

full force and effect, and no event has occurred which, with or without notice,
lapse of time or both, would constitute a breach or default on the part of any
Guarantor under its respective Guaranty.

unreasonably small capital for the business in which it is and will be engaged,
and (c) will be solvent.

          4.12 Governmental Entity or Accrediting Body Approval. As of the date
hereof, there exists no fact or circumstance attributable to Merger Co or any of
its Subsidiaries or any Equity Investor (or any person or entity that exercises
Substantial Control (as such term is defined in Section 4.13) over any of the
foregoing), which would reasonably be expected to have a material adverse impact
on the Company's or Merger Co's ability to obtain any authorization, consent, or
similar approval from the DOE or any other Education Department, Governmental
Entity, or Accrediting Body whose authorization, consent, or similar approval is
contemplated in connection with this Agreement, including, without limitation,
any authorization, consent, or similar approval which must be obtained following
the Closing from the DOE or any Education Department or Accrediting Body in
order to continue the operations of the Schools as presently conducted; provided
that no representation or warranty is made in this Section 4.12 with respect to
the effect of the expected leverage of the Company after the Effective Date.

          4.13 Status of Investors and Borrowers. From July 1, 2002 to the date
hereof, or in the case of Merger Co, its formation date, none of Merger Co, any
person or entity that exercises Substantial Control over Merger Co or any Equity
Investor, or member of such person's family (as the term "family" is defined in
34 C.F.R. Section 600.21(f)), alone or together, (a) exercises or exercised
Substantial Control over a post-secondary institution or third-party servicer
(as that term is defined in 34 C.F.R. Section 668.2) that owes a liability for a
violation of a Title IV Program or other HEA program requirement, or (b) owes a
liability for a Title IV Program or other HEA program violation. At no time has
any of Merger Co, any person or entity that exercises Substantial Control over
Merger Co or any Equity Investor, filed for relief in bankruptcy or had entered
against it an order for relief in bankruptcy. None of Merger Co, any person or
entity that exercises Substantial Control over Merger Co or any Equity Investor,
has pled guilty to, has pled nolo contendere to, or has been found guilty of a
crime involving the acquisition, use, or expenditure of funds under the Title IV
Programs or has been judicially determined to have committed fraud involving
funds under the Title IV Programs. From July 1, 2002 to the date hereof, to
Merger Co's Knowledge, neither Merger Co nor any Equity Investor has employed
any individual or entity in a capacity that involves the administration or
receipt of funds under the Title IV programs, or contracted with any institution
or third-party servicer, which has been terminated under the Title IV Programs
for a reason involving the acquisition, use, or expenditure of federal, state or
local government funds, or has been convicted of, or has pled nolo contendere or
guilty to, a crime involving the acquisition, use or expenditure of


                                      -33-

federal, state, or local government funds, or has been administratively or
judicially determined to have committed fraud or any other material violation of
law involving federal, state, or local government funds.

nothing contained in this Section 5.02 shall prevent Merger Co from taking
actions in accordance with, and consistent with the time periods permitted by,
Section 6.08).

                                    ARTICLE 6

                              ADDITIONAL AGREEMENTS

          6.01 Proxy Statement; Other Filings. As promptly as practicable
following the date of this Agreement (but in any event within 15 Business Days
thereafter unless the parties shall otherwise agree), (a) the Company shall
prepare (in consultation with Merger Co) and file with the SEC the preliminary
Proxy Statement, and (b) each of the Company and the Merger Co shall, or shall
cause their respective Affiliates to, prepare and file with the SEC all Other
Filings that are required to be filed by such party in connection with the
transactions contemplated hereby. Each of the Company and Merger Co shall
furnish all information concerning itself and its Affiliates that is required to
be included in the Proxy Statement or, to the extent applicable, the Other
Filings, or that is customarily included in proxy statements or other filings
prepared in connection with transactions of the type contemplated by this
Agreement. Each of the Company and Merger Co shall use its respective reasonable
best efforts to respond as promptly as practicable to any comments of the SEC
with respect to the Proxy Statement or the Other Filings, and the Company shall
use its reasonable best efforts to cause the definitive Proxy Statement to be
mailed to the Company's shareholders as promptly as reasonably practicable after
the date of this Agreement. Each party shall promptly notify the other party
upon the receipt of any comments from the SEC or its staff or any request from
the SEC or its staff for amendments or supplements to the Proxy Statement or the
Other Filings and shall provide the other party with copies of all
correspondence between it and its Representatives, on the one hand, and the SEC
and its staff, on the other hand relating to the Proxy Statement or the Other
Filings. If at any time prior to the Company Shareholders' Meeting, any
information relating to the Company, Merger Co, or any of their respective
Affiliates, officers or directors, should be discovered by the Company or Merger
Co which should be set forth in an amendment or supplement to the Proxy
Statement or the Other Filings, so that the Proxy Statement or the Other Filings
shall not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any
material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the
statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they are made, not
misleading, the party which discovers such information shall promptly notify the
other parties, and an appropriate amendment or supplement describing such
information shall be filed with the SEC and, to the extent required by
applicable Law, disseminated to the shareholders of the Company. Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary stated above, prior to filing or mailing the Proxy
Statement or filing the Other Filings (or, in each case, any amendment or
supplement thereto) or responding to any comments of the SEC with respect
thereto, the party responsible for filing or mailing such document shall provide
the other party an opportunity to review and comment on such document or
response and shall include in such document or response comments reasonably
proposed by the other party.

          6.02 Company Shareholders' Meeting. The Company shall duly call, give
notice of, convene, and hold a meeting of its shareholders (the "Company
Shareholders' Meeting") for the purpose of voting upon the adoption of this
Agreement as promptly as reasonably practicable


                                      -37-

<PAGE>

after the date of the Agreement. Unless this Agreement shall have been
terminated in accordance with Section 8.01, the Company shall hold the Company
Shareholders' Meeting regardless of whether the Company Board has effected a
Change in Board Recommendation. Subject to Section 6.04(c), the Company Board
shall recommend to holders of the Shares that they adopt this Agreement and
shall include such recommendation in the Proxy Statement. Subject to Section
6.04(c), the Company will use reasonable best efforts to solicit from its
shareholders proxies in favor of the adoption of this Agreement and will take
all other action necessary or advisable to secure the vote or consent of its
shareholders required by the rules of the NASD or applicable Law to obtain such
approvals. The Company shall keep Merger Co updated with respect to proxy
solicitation results as reasonably requested by Merger Co.

          6.03 Access to Information; Confidentiality.

          (a) Except as otherwise prohibited by applicable Law or the terms of
any Contract entered into prior to the date hereof or as would reasonably be
expected to violate or result in the loss or impairment of any attorney-client
or work-product privilege (it being understood that the parties shall each use
reasonable best efforts to cause such information to be provided in a manner
that does not result in such violation, loss or impairment), from the date of
this Agreement until the Effective Time (or the earlier termination of this
Agreement in accordance with Article 8), the Company shall (and shall cause its
Subsidiaries to): (i) provide to Merger Co and to the officers, directors,
employees, accountants, legal counsel, investment bankers, financial advisors,
financing sources, and other agents and representatives (collectively,
"Representatives") of Merger Co reasonable access, during normal business hours
and upon reasonable prior notice and subject to reasonable confidentiality
restrictions by Merger Co, to the officers, employees, agents, properties,
offices, and other facilities of the Company and its Subsidiaries and to the
books and records thereof, and (ii) subject to Section 6.03(b), permit Merger Co
to make such copies and inspections thereof as Merger Co may reasonably request,
and (iii) furnish promptly to Merger Co such information concerning the
business, properties, contracts, assets, liabilities, personnel, and other
aspects of the Company and its Subsidiaries as Merger Co or its Representatives
may reasonably request; provided, however, that the Company shall not be
required to provide access or furnish any information in the event of any
litigation between the parties to this Agreement except pursuant to applicable
rules of discovery.

          (b) Prior to the Closing, all information obtained by Merger Co or its
Representatives pursuant to this Section 6.03 or otherwise shall be kept
confidential in accordance with the confidentiality letter agreement, dated
January 21, 2006 (the "Confidentiality Agreement"), among GS Capital Partners V
Fund, L.P., Providence Equity Partners, Inc., the Company, and the other parties
thereto; provided, however, that Merger Co and its Representatives shall be
permitted to disclose information as necessary and consistent with customary
practices in connection with the Commitments; and provided, further, that the
Company hereby consents to the Equity Investors' disclosure of "Material" as
defined in the Confidentiality Agreement to any sources of debt or equity
financing, and that each such source of debt or equity financing executes and
delivers to the Company a representative's letter in the form attached as
Exhibit A to the Confidentiality Agreement.

          6.04 No Solicitation of Transactions.

          (a) Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries shall, nor shall
it authorize or permit the Representatives of the Company or its Subsidiaries
to, directly or indirectly, (i) solicit, initiate, propose or encourage, or
otherwise facilitate (including by way of furnishing information) the submission
of any Acquisition Proposal, (ii) initiate, participate in, or continue
discussions or negotiations regarding, or furnish to any person (other than
Merger Co or its Representatives) any non-public information in connection with,
or which would reasonably be expected to result in, any Acquisition Proposal,
(iii) otherwise cooperate in any way with, or knowingly assist or participate
in, or facilitate or encourage any effort or attempt by any person (other than
Merger Co or its Representatives) with respect to, or which would reasonably be
expected to result in, an Acquisition Proposal, or (iv) take any action (A) to
render the Rights issued pursuant to the terms of the Company Rights Agreement
inapplicable to an Acquisition Proposal or the transactions contemplated
thereby, exempt or exclude any person from the definition of an Acquiring Person
(as defined in the Company Rights Agreement) under the terms of the Company
Rights Agreement or, other than as contemplated by this Agreement in connection
with the Merger, to redeem the rights or allow the Rights to expire prior to
their expiration date, or (B) to render the provisions of the PA Anti-Takeover
Statutes inapplicable to any person (other than Merger Co or its Affiliates) or
group in connection with any Acquisition Proposal; provided, however, that,
prior to the adoption of this Agreement at the Company's Shareholders Meeting,
nothing contained in this Agreement or in this Section 6.04 shall restrict or
prevent the Company (acting at the direction of the Company Board) or the
Company Board from furnishing information to, or engaging in negotiations, or
discussions with, any person or group in connection with an unsolicited bona
fide Acquisition Proposal by such person or group received after the date
hereof, if and only to the extent that prior to taking such action the Company
Board determines in good faith (after consultation with its advisors) that such
Acquisition Proposal is, or could reasonably be expected to result in, a
Superior Proposal, and receives from such person or group an executed
confidentiality agreement, the terms of which are substantially similar to and
no less favorable to the Company than those contained in the Confidentiality
Agreement.

          (b) The Company shall notify Merger Co as promptly as practicable (and
in any event within 24 hours) orally and in writing of the receipt by the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries, or any of its or their respective
Representatives, of any inquiries, proposals or offers, requests for information
or requests for discussions or negotiations regarding any Acquisition Proposal,
specifying the material terms and conditions thereof and the identity of the
person making such proposal, and shall provide to Merger Co, within such 24 hour
time frame, a copy of all written materials subsequently provided to or by the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries in connection with any such inquiries,
proposals or offers. The Company shall keep Merger Co reasonably informed of the
status of any such discussions or negotiations and shall notify Merger Co (as
promptly as practicable and in any event within 24 hours) orally and in writing
of any material modifications to the financial or other material terms of such
inquiries, proposals or offers and shall provide to Merger Co, within such 24
hour time frame, a copy of all written materials subsequently provided to or by
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries in connection with any such inquiries,
proposals or offers. The Company agrees that it shall not, and shall cause its
Subsidiaries not to, enter into any confidentiality agreement with any person
subsequent to the date of this Agreement which prohibits the Company from
providing such


                                      -39-



<PAGE>

information to Merger Co. The Company agrees that neither it nor any of its
Subsidiaries shall terminate, waive, amend or modify any provision of any
existing standstill or confidentiality agreement to which it or any of its
Subsidiaries is a party and that it and its Subsidiaries shall enforce the
provisions of any such agreement. The Company shall, and shall cause its
Subsidiaries and its and their Representatives to, immediately cease and cause
to be terminated any discussions or negotiations with any parties that may be
ongoing with respect to any Acquisition Proposal as of the date hereof, shall
take reasonable steps to inform its and its Subsidiaries' Representatives of the
obligations undertaken in this Section 6.04, and shall request that all
confidential information previously furnished to any such third parties be
returned promptly.

          (c) Except as set forth in this Section 6.04(c), the Company Board (or
any committee thereof) shall not, and shall not publicly propose to: (i)
withdraw, modify, or change in a manner adverse to Merger Co, the approval or
recommendation of this Agreement, the Merger or the Other Transactions by the
Company Board (or any committee thereof) or cause the representation and
warranty in Section 3.22 to be untrue in any material respects; (ii) approve,
adopt, recommend or take any action other than to recommend shareholders reject
any Acquisition Proposal; or (iii) approve or recommend, or allow the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries to enter into, any letter of intent, acquisition
agreement, or other similar agreement with respect to, or that is reasonably
expected to result in, any Acquisition Proposal (other than a confidentiality
agreement referred to in this Section 6.04). Notwithstanding the foregoing,
prior to the adoption of this Agreement at the Company Shareholders' Meeting, in
response to the receipt of an unsolicited bona fide written Acquisition
Proposal, if the Company Board determines in good faith (after consultation with
its advisors) that such Acquisition Proposal is a Superior Proposal, then the
Company Board may approve and recommend such Superior Proposal and, in
connection with such Superior Proposal, withdraw, modify, or change in a manner
adverse to Merger Co, the Company Board Recommendation (a "Change in Board
Recommendation"). The Company shall not effect a Change in Board Recommendation
unless the Company has complied with its obligations under Section 6.04(b).

          (d) Nothing contained in this Agreement shall prohibit the Company
from taking and disclosing to its shareholders a position contemplated by Rules
14d-9 and 14e-2(a) promulgated under the Exchange Act or from making any
disclosure to the Company's shareholders if the Company Board (or any committee
thereof) determines in good faith (after consultation with its outside legal
counsel) that it is required to do so under applicable Law; provided, however,
that neither the Company nor the Company Board (nor any committee thereof) shall
(i) recommend that the shareholders of the Company tender their Shares in
connection with any such tender or exchange offer (or otherwise approve or
recommend any Acquisition Proposal) or take any position under Rule 14e-2(a)
other than recommending rejection of such tender or exchange offer, or (ii)
withdraw, modify, or change in a manner materially adverse to Merger Co, the
Company Board Recommendation, unless in each case the requirements of Section
6.04(c) shall have been satisfied.

          (e) For purposes of this Agreement, "Acquisition Proposal" means any
proposal or offer (including any proposal from or to the Company's shareholders)
from any person or group other than Merger Co relating to: (i) any direct or
indirect acquisition or purchase, in a single transaction or series of related
transactions by such person or group acting in concert, of


                                      -40-

<PAGE>

(A) more than 20% of the fair market value of the assets, securities, or other
ownership interests (including capital stock of the Company's Subsidiaries) of
the Company and its consolidated Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, or (B) more
than 20% of any class of equity securities of the Company; (ii) any tender offer
or exchange offer (including through the filing with the SEC of a Schedule TO),
as defined pursuant to the Exchange Act, that if consummated, would result in
any person or group beneficially owning 20% or more of any class of equity
securities of the Company; or (iii) any merger, consolidation, business
combination, recapitalization, liquidation, dissolution, or other similar
transaction involving the Company as a result of which any person or group
acting in concert would acquire the assets, securities, or businesses described
in any of clauses (A) and (B) above.

          6.05 Directors' and Officers' Indemnification and Insurance.

          (a) The Articles of Incorporation of the Surviving Corporation shall
contain provisions no less favorable with respect to elimination or limitation
of liability and indemnification than are set forth in the Articles of
Incorporation and Bylaws of the Company as of the date hereof, which provisions
shall not be amended, repealed, or otherwise modified for a period of six years
from the Effective Time in any manner that would affect adversely the rights
thereunder of individuals who, at or prior to the Effective Time, were directors
or officers, of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries.

          (b) From and after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation
shall, to the fullest extent permitted under applicable Law, indemnify, defend,
and hold harmless, each present and former director and officer of the Company
and each Subsidiary of the Company (collectively, the "Indemnified Parties")
against any and all costs and expenses (including attorneys' fees), judgments,
fines, losses, claims, damages, liabilities and settlement amounts
(collectively, "Losses") paid or incurred in connection with any claim, action,
suit, proceeding or investigation (whether arising before or after the Effective
Time), whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative, arising out of
or pertaining to any action or omission in their capacity as an officer,
director, or fiduciary occurring on or before the Effective Time, to the same
extent as provided in the Articles of Incorporation and Bylaws of the Company,
as amended to the date hereof, and without limiting any rights under any other
applicable contract or agreement. In the event of any such claim, action, suit,
proceeding or investigation, (i) the Surviving Corporation shall pay the
reasonable fees and expenses of counsel selected by the Indemnified Parties,
which counsel shall be reasonably satisfactory to the Surviving Corporation,
promptly after statements therefor are received (provided the applicable
Indemnified Party provides an undertaking to repay all advanced expenses if it
is finally judicially determined that such Indemnified Party is not entitled to
indemnification) and (ii) the Surviving Corporation shall cooperate in the
defense of any such matter; provided, however, that the Surviving Corporation
shall not be liable for any settlement effected without the Surviving
Corporation's written consent (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld,
or delayed); provided, further, that the Surviving Corporation shall not be
obligated pursuant to this Section 6.05(b) to pay the fees and expenses of more
than one counsel (selected by a plurality of the applicable Indemnified Parties)
for all Indemnified Parties with respect to any single action or related actions
except to the extent that two or more of such Indemnified Parties shall have
conflicting interests in the outcome of such action; and provided, further,
that, in the event that any claim for indemnification is asserted or made within
such six year period from the Effective Time, all


                                      -41-

<PAGE>

rights to indemnification in respect of such claim shall continue until the
disposition of such claim.

          (c) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall endeavor to obtain
and fully pay (up to a maximum cost of 300% of the current annual premiums paid
for its existing coverage in the aggregate) for "tail" insurance policies with a
claims period of at least six years from the Effective Time with respect to
directors' and officers' liability insurance in amount and scope at least as
favorable as the Company's existing policies for claims arising from facts or
events that occurred on or prior to the Effective Time. If the Company is unable
to obtain such "tail" insurance prior to the Effective Time, the Surviving
Corporation shall, as soon as practicable after the Effective Time, either (i)
cause to be obtained and fully pay for retroactive to the Effective Time "tail"
insurance policies with a claims period of at least six years from the Effective
Time with respect to directors' and officers' liability insurance in amount and
scope at least as favorable as the Company's existing policies for claims
arising from facts or events that occurred on or prior to the Effective Time or
(ii) maintain in effect for six years from the Effective Time the current
directors' and officers' liability insurance policies maintained by the Company
(provided that the Surviving Corporation may substitute therefor policies of at
least the same coverage containing terms and conditions that are not less
favorable) with respect to matters occurring prior to the Effective Time;
provided, however, that in no event shall the Surviving Corporation be required
to expend pursuant to this Section 6.05(c) more than an amount in the aggregate
equal to 300% of the current annual premiums paid by the Company for such
insurance; provided, further, that the Surviving Corporation shall be required
to obtain as much coverage as is possible under substantially similar policies
for such maximum annual amount. The Company represents that such current annual
premium amount is set forth in Section 6.05(c) of the Company Disclosure
Schedule.

          (d) In the event Merger Co or the Surviving Corporation or any of
their respective successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any
other person and shall not be the continuing or surviving corporation or entity
of such consolidation or merger, or (ii) transfers all or substantially all of
its properties and assets to any person, then, and in each such case, proper
provision shall be made so that the successors and assigns of Merger Co or the
Surviving Corporation, as the case may be, shall succeed to the obligations set
forth in this Section 6.05.

          (e) Merger Co shall cause the Surviving Corporation to perform all of
the obligations of the Surviving Corporation under this Section 6.05.

          (f) If the Surviving Corporation refuses or fails to make any payment
to any Indemnified Party required by this Section 6.05, the Indemnified Party
shall be promptly indemnified by the Surviving Corporation against reasonable
expenses (including reasonable attorneys' fees, disbursements, and other
charges) actually and reasonably incurred by the Indemnified Party in connection
with the successful establishment of such Indemnified Party's right to
indemnification or advancement of expenses, in whole or in part, in an action in
a court of competent jurisdiction. The rights of each of the Indemnified Parties
under this Section 6.05 shall be in addition to any right such person might have
under the Articles of Incorporation or Bylaws of the Company, the Surviving
Corporation, or any of their respective Subsidiaries, or under any agreement or
insurance policies applicable to the Indemnified Party. The provisions


                                      -42-

<PAGE>

of this Section 6.05 survive the consummation of the Merger and are intended to
be for the benefit of, and shall be enforceable by, each of the Indemnified
Parties, their respective heirs and representatives.

          6.06 Employee Benefits Matters.

          (a) Until December 31, 2007, Merger Co shall, or it shall cause the
Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries to, (i) provide each employee of the
Company and its Subsidiaries as of the Effective Time (each, an "Employee") with
at least the same level of base salary that was provided to each such Employee
immediately prior to the Effective Time, and (ii) provide the Employees with
salary, employee benefits and annual incentive compensation opportunities that
are no less favorable in the aggregate than those provided to the Employees by
the Company and its Subsidiaries pursuant to the Plans set forth on Section
3.13(a) of the Company Disclosure Schedule (excluding, for this purpose, any
equity-based incentives) immediately prior to the Effective Time. From and after
the Effective Time, Merger Co shall cause the Surviving Corporation and its
Subsidiaries to honor in accordance with their terms (including, without
limitation, terms which provide for amendment or termination), all contracts,
agreements, arrangements, policies, plans and commitments of the Company and its
Subsidiaries as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time that are
applicable to Employees, in each case, to the extent described or referenced in
Section 3.13(a) of the Company Disclosure Schedule. Subject to Section 6.06(d),
nothing in this Agreement shall be deemed to be a guarantee of employment for
any Employee, or to restrict the right of the Surviving Corporation to alter the
terms and conditions of employment of any Employee or to terminate, suspend,
modify or amend any Plan in accordance with its terms in effect immediately
prior to the Effective Time.

          (b) Employees shall receive credit for all purposes (including for
purposes of eligibility to participate, vesting, benefit accrual and eligibility
to receive benefits, but excluding benefit accruals under any defined benefit
pension plan) under any employee benefit plan, program or arrangement
established or maintained by Merger Co, the Surviving Corporation, or any of
their respective Subsidiaries, under which each Employee may be eligible to
participate on or after the Effective Time to the same extent recognized by the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries under comparable Plans immediately prior to
the Effective Time; provided, however, that such crediting of service shall not
operate to duplicate any benefit or the funding of any such benefit. Such plan,
program or arrangement shall credit each such Employee for service accrued or
deemed accrued on or prior to the Effective Time with the Company or any
Subsidiary of the Company; provided, however, that such crediting of service
shall not operate to duplicate any benefit or the funding of any such benefit.

          (c) With respect to the welfare benefit plans, programs and
arrangements maintained, sponsored or contributed to by Merger Co or the
Surviving Corporation ("Purchaser Welfare Benefit Plans") in which an Employee
may be eligible to participate on or after the Effective Time, Merger Co shall
(i) waive, or use commercially reasonable efforts to cause its insurance carrier
to waive, all limitations as to preexisting and at-work conditions, if any, with
respect to participation and coverage requirements applicable to each Employee
under any Purchaser Welfare Benefit Plan to the same extent waived under a
comparable Plan, and (ii) provide credit to each Employee for any co-payments,
deductibles and out-of-pocket expenses


                                      -43-

<PAGE>

paid by such Employee under the Plans during the relevant plan year, up to and
including the Effective Time.

          (d) From and after the Effective Time, Merger Co shall (i) assume and
be bound by, or cause the Surviving Corporation to assume and be bound by all
agreements and arrangements of the Company and its Subsidiaries, including each
severance and separation pay plan, written employment, severance, retention,
incentive, change in control and termination agreement or arrangement, set forth
in Section 6.06(d) of the Company Disclosure Schedule and applicable to
Employees at the Effective Time, and (ii) honor or cause to be honored, in
accordance with their terms (including, without limitation, terms which provide
for amendment or termination), all such agreements and arrangements of the
Company and its Subsidiaries, in the same manner and to the same extent that the
Company would be required to perform and honor such agreements and arrangements
if the Merger had not been consummated.

          (e) On and after the date hereof, no future offering periods will be
commenced under the Company's Employee Stock Purchase Plan ("ESPP"). All
offering periods in progress on the date hereof shall cease, and the Company
shall terminate the ESPP, on the NASDAQ National Market trading day immediately
prior to the Effective Time. On such date, all rights of each participating
Employee then outstanding shall be deemed to be automatically exercised and each
participating Employee will be credited with the number of Shares purchased for
his or her account(s) under the ESPP during such offering period. The Company
Board shall send written notice that the Merger will result in the termination
of the ESPP to all participating Employees not later than ten Business Days
after the date hereof. With respect to persons participating in the ESPP on the
date on which the offering period cease and the ESPP terminates (and who have
not withdrawn from or otherwise ceased participation in the Plan prior to such
date), accumulated contributions will be applied on such date to the purchase of
Company Common Stock in accordance with the ESPP's terms (treating the date of
termination as the last day of the relevant offering period). With respect to
matters described in this Section 6.06(e), the Company will communicate with
Merger Co prior to sending any material notices or other communication materials
to its employees (and reasonably consider Merger Co's comments with respect
thereto).

          (f) For the avoidance of doubt, no provision of this Section 6.06
shall create any third party beneficiary rights in any Employee (or beneficiary
or dependent thereof) or shall create any right in respect of continued
employment or resumed employment, and no provision of this Section 6.06 shall
create any rights in any such persons in respect of any benefits that may be
provided, directly or indirectly, under any contract, agreement, arrangement,
policy, plan or commitment.

          6.07 Notification of Certain Matters.

          (a) The Company shall notify Merger Co promptly of any event, change,
occurrence, circumstance or development between the date of this Agreement and
the Effective Time which causes or is reasonably likely to cause the conditions
set forth in Sections 7.02(a) and 7.02(b) of this Agreement not to be satisfied.


                                      -44-

<PAGE>

          (b) Merger Co shall notify the Company promptly of any event, change,
occurrence, circumstance or development between the date of this Agreement and
the Effective Time which causes or is reasonably likely to cause the conditions
set forth in Sections 7.03(a) and 7.03(b) of this Agreement not to be satisfied.

          (c) The delivery of any notice pursuant to this Section 6.07 shall not
limit or otherwise affect the remedies available hereunder to the party
receiving such notice.

          (d) In addition, the Company shall give prompt written notice to
Merger Co, and Merger Co shall give prompt written notice to the Company, of any
notice or other communication (i) from any person and the response thereto of
the Company or its Subsidiaries or Merger Co, as the case may be, or its or
their Representatives alleging that the consent of such person is or may be
required in connection with this Agreement or the Merger, (ii) from any
Governmental Entity and the response thereto of the Company or its Subsidiaries
or Merger Co, as the case may be, or its or their Representatives in connection
with this Agreement or the Merger, and (iii) from or to the SEC, except in the
event the Company Board shall have effected a Change of Board Recommendation.

          6.08 Financing.

          (a) Merger Co shall use its reasonable best efforts to arrange and
consummate all of the Commitments, including using its reasonable best efforts
to (i) negotiate definitive agreements with respect thereto on terms and
conditions contained therein and (ii) to satisfy all conditions in such
definitive agreements that are within its control. In the event all or any
portion of the equity or debt financing under the Commitments becomes
unavailable on the terms and conditions contemplated in the Commitments,
including as a result of any Lender MAC (as defined below), Merger Co shall use
its reasonable best efforts to arrange to obtain any such financing from
alternative sources on terms not materially less favorable in the aggregate to
Merger Co (as determined in the reasonable good faith judgment of Merger Co) as
promptly as practicable following the occurrence of such event (the "Alternative
Financing"). Merger Co shall give the Company prompt notice of any material
breach by any party of any Commitments or any termination of any Commitments.
Merger Co shall keep the Company reasonably informed of the status of its
efforts to arrange the Commitments and shall promptly notify the Company orally
and in writing of any material modifications to the Commitments and shall not
permit any material amendment or modification to be made to, or any waiver of
any material provision or remedy under, any Commitment without first consulting
with the Company and no amendment, modification, or waiver which would be
inconsistent with the terms set forth in the DOE Request Letter shall be made or
given without the prior written consent of the Company. For purposes of this
Agreement, the term "Marketing Period" shall mean the first period of twenty
consecutive Business Days after the date hereof throughout which (A) Merger Co
shall have the Required Information pursuant to Section 6.08(b), which Required
Information is and remains Compliant (as defined below) and (B) the conditions
set forth in Sections 7.01(c) and (d) and 7.02 (other than 7.02(c) and (h))
shall be and remain satisfied (for this purpose, as of the date of the
commencement of the Marketing Period) and at the end of which all conditions set
forth in Section 7.01 and 7.02 shall be satisfied, provided that the Marketing
Period shall end on any earlier date which is the third Business Day following
the date the financing contemplated by the Commitment Letters is consummated.
"Compliant" shall mean, with respect to any Required


                                      -45-

<PAGE>

Information, that such Required Information does not contain any untrue
statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact regarding the
Company and it Subsidiaries necessary in order to make such Required Information
not misleading and is, and remains throughout the Marketing Period, compliant in
all material respects with all applicable requirements of Regulation S-K and
Regulation S-X and a registration statement on Form S-1 (or any applicable
successor form) under the Securities Act, in each case assuming such Required
Information is intended to be the information to be used for a public offering
of securities by the Company in connection with the debt financing contemplated
by the Debt Commitment Letter. For purposes of this Agreement, the term "Lender
MAC" shall mean (1) any restriction on lending imposed by a regulatory authority
on, or a petition of bankruptcy, insolvency, or reorganization (or similar
petition or initiation of proceedings under any debtor relief Law) filed by or
against, or the seeking of the appointment of a receiver or similar person by,
or the making of an assignment for the benefit of creditors by, any lender or
lenders providing at least 25% of the financing contemplated by the Debt
Commitment Letter or (2) any order, decree, or injunction of a court or agency
of competent jurisdiction, including any such lender's primary banking regulator
or regulators, prohibiting the consummation of the financing contemplated by the
Debt Commitment Letter affecting any lender or lenders providing at least 25% of
the financing contemplated by the Debt Commitment Letter, which, in each case,
prevents the lender or lenders from providing the financing contemplated by the
Debt Commitment Letter and which, in the case of any petition filed against any
such lender or lenders, is not dismissed within ten Business Days of being
filed.

          (b) The Company shall provide, and shall cause its Subsidiaries and
its and their Representatives to provide, all cooperation in connection with the
arrangement of the equity and debt financing under the Commitments (or
Alternative Financing) as may be reasonably requested by Merger Co, including
(i) participation in meetings, presentations, drafting sessions, management
presentation sessions, "road shows," sessions with ratings agencies and due
diligence sessions, (ii) furnishing Merger Co and its financing sources with
financial statements and related information, including audited financial
statements for the Company for each of the three fiscal years ended June 30,
2005, June 30, 2004 and June 30, 2003 and other financial and pertinent
information regarding the Company as may be reasonably requested by Merger Co,
including all financial statements and financial data of the type required by
Regulation S-X and Regulation S-K under the Securities Act and of type and form
customarily included in the offering memoranda for private placements under Rule
144A of the Securities Act, to consummate the offerings of debt securities
contemplated by the Commitments at the time during the Company's fiscal year
such offerings will be made, (iii) assisting Merger Co and its financing sources
in the preparation of (A) an offering document for any financing contemplated by
the Commitments and (B) materials for rating agency presentations (collectively,
the "Required Information"), (iv) satisfying the conditions set forth in the
Commitments which require action by or cooperation of the Company, (v)
facilitating the pledging of collateral, (vi) using commercially reasonable
efforts to obtain accountants' comfort letters, legal opinions, surveys, and
title insurance as reasonably requested by Merger Co, (vii) assisting any tax or
other structural planning undertaken by Merger Co in connection with the
transactions contemplated hereby, (viii) executing and delivering any commitment
letters, underwriting or placement agreements, pledge and security documents,
other definitive financing or other documents as may be reasonably requested by
Merger Co, including a certificate of the chief financial or other appropriate
officer of any of the Company or its Subsidiaries with respect to solvency and


                                      -46-

<PAGE>

financial matters in customary form and substance reasonably acceptable to the
Company and its legal counsel, (ix) obtaining any necessary rating agencies'
confirmations or approvals for Merger Co's financing and (x) providing and
executing documents as may be reasonably requested by Merger Co in form and
substance reasonably acceptable to the Company; provided, however, that none of
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries shall be required to pay any commitment
or other similar fee or incur any other liability in connection with the equity
or debt financing under the Commitments prior to the Effective Time. Following
the termination of this Agreement pursuant to Sections 8.01(a), (c), or (e),
Merger Co shall (i) promptly upon request by the Company, reimburse the Company
for all reasonable out-of-pocket costs incurred by the Company or its
Subsidiaries in connection with such cooperation and (ii) indemnify, defend, and
hold harmless the Company, its Subsidiaries, and their respective
Representatives for and against any and all liabilities, losses, damages,
claims, costs, expenses, interest, awards, judgments and penalties suffered or
incurred by them in connection with any information utilized in connection with
the arrangement of the equity and debt financing under the Commitments (other
than information provided by the Company, it Subsidiaries or any of their
respective Representatives or contained in the SEC Reports).

          (c) All non-public or otherwise confidential information regarding the
Company or its Subsidiaries obtained by Merger Co or its representatives
pursuant to Section 6.08(b) shall be kept confidential in accordance with the
Confidentiality Agreement; provided, however, that Merger Co and its
Representatives shall be permitted to disclose information as necessary or
consistent with customary practices in connection with the Commitments.

          (d) Within fifteen Business Days of there having occurred after the
date of this Agreement (i) any general suspension of trading in, or limitation
on prices for, securities on the NYSE or NASD for three or more consecutive
Business Days, including but not limited to, as a result of actual or threatened
terrorist attacks, responses by the United States or its allies thereto, or the
effects thereof, (ii) the declaration of a banking moratorium or any suspension
of payments in respect of banks in the United States generally for three or more
consecutive Business Days, (iii) the commencement or material escalation of a
war, armed hostilities or other international or national crisis or security
event involving the United States or any of its territories, including any acts
of terrorism, domestic or foreign or responses of the United States or its
allies, or a national or international economic or financial crisis, as a result
of which there has occurred any material disruption or material adverse change
in the United States commercial credit, debt, or capital securities markets
(including the market for leveraged loans or high yield securities) for a period
of three or more consecutive Business Days, or (iv) any limitation by any
governmental, regulatory, or administrative agency which prohibits the extension
of credit by banks or other lending institutions in the United States generally
in a manner that prevents a lender from providing the financing contemplated by
the Debt Commitment Letter for a period of three or more consecutive Business
Days, Merger Co shall deliver to the Company a certificate (the "Market MAC
Notice") to that effect signed by an officer of Merger Co, describing in
reasonable detail the nature of the Market MAC (any of the events specified in
clauses (i) through (iv) described in such Market MAC Notice being hereinafter
referred to as a "Market MAC"). At any time following its receipt of the Market
MAC Notice, the Company may request (by delivery of a written notice to Merger
Co to such effect (a "Company Waiver Request")) that Merger Co fully and
irrevocably waive its right to invoke the condition set forth in Section 7.02(d)
with respect to such Market MAC. In the event that Merger Co delivers to the
Company a written


                                      -47-

<PAGE>

notice that Merger Co waives its right to invoke the condition set forth in
Section 7.02(d) with respect to such Market MAC (a "Merger Co Waiver Notice"),
then such Market MAC shall cease to be a basis for Merger Co not consummating
the Merger. In the event that Merger Co fails to deliver a Merger Co Waiver
Notice with respect to a Market MAC within the longer of (i) five Business Days
after Merger Co's receipt of the corresponding Company Waiver Request and (ii)
the number of days between the date on which Merger Co delivered to the Company
the corresponding Market MAC Notice and the date on which the Company delivered
to Merger Co the Company Waiver Request (the longer of such periods being
referred to herein as "Requisite Response Period"), then the Company shall be
entitled to terminate the Agreement pursuant to Section 8.01(i) within ten
Business Days after expiration of the Requisite Response Period. Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary in this Section 6.08(d), nothing shall release Merger
Co from continuing to be obligated to use its reasonable best efforts to obtain
(A) the financing contemplated by the Debt Commitment Letter or (B) the
Alternative Financing, in accordance with Section 6.08(a) in the event Merger Co
declines to timely waive its right to invoke the condition set forth in Section
7.02(d) with respect to a Market MAC.

          6.09 Further Action; Reasonable Best Efforts.

          (a) Upon the terms and subject to the conditions of this Agreement,
each of the parties hereto shall use its reasonable best efforts to (i) take, or
cause to be taken, all appropriate action, and to do, or cause to be done, all
things necessary, proper or advisable under applicable Law or otherwise to
consummate the Merger and complete the Other Transactions, (ii) obtain from
Governmental Entities any consents, licenses, permits, waivers, approvals,
authorizations or orders required to be obtained by Merger Co or the Company or
any of their respective Subsidiaries in connection with the authorization,
execution, and delivery of this Agreement, and (iii) promptly make all necessary
filings, and thereafter make any other required submission, with respect to this
Agreement and the Merger required under the HSR Act or any other applicable
antitrust, competition or fair trade Laws with respect to the Merger. Subject to
appropriate confidentiality protections, the parties hereto shall have an
opportunity to review and approve in advance drafts of all applications,
notices, petitions, filings and other documents made or prepared in connection
with the items described in clauses (i) through (iii) above, which approval
shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned, or delayed, shall cooperate
with each other in connection with the prompt making of all such filings, shall
furnish to the other party such necessary information and assistance as such
other party may reasonably request with respect to the foregoing and shall
provide the other party with copies of all filings made by such party with any
applicable Government Entity, and, upon request, any other information supplied
by such party to a Governmental Entity in connection with this Agreement and the
Merger.

          (b) Merger Co and the Company shall each use their respective
reasonable best efforts to obtain any third party consents (i) necessary, proper
or advisable to consummate the Merger and the Other Transactions, (ii) disclosed
in the Company Disclosure Schedule, or (iii) required to prevent a Company
Material Adverse Effect from occurring prior to or as a result of the Effective
Time. In the event that the Company shall fail to obtain any third party consent
described above, the Company shall use its reasonable best efforts, and shall
take such actions as are reasonably requested by Merger Co, to minimize any
adverse effect upon the Company and Merger Co and their respective businesses
resulting, or which would reasonably be expected to result, after the Effective
Time, from the failure to obtain such consent.


                                      -48-

<PAGE>

          (c) The Company and each of its Subsidiaries, with the cooperation of
Merger Co, will take all commercially reasonable steps, and proceed diligently
and in good faith to submit pre-acquisition review applications with the DOE
within 15 Business Days of the date of this Agreement and promptly to submit
other applications, notices and submissions with DOE and other Education
Departments and Accrediting Bodies which must be filed prior to the Closing in
order for the Company to obtain (i) all Education Department and Accrediting
Body approvals and permits which must be obtained prior to the Closing in order
for Merger Co to operate the Schools as they are currently operated and for the
Schools to participate in all of the Student Financial Assistance Programs,
including the Title IV Programs, under the ownership of Merger Co (collectively,
the "Pre-Closing Education Consents," identified as such in Section 3.05(b)(vii)
of the Company Disclosure Schedule), and (ii) all Education Department and
Accrediting Body approvals and permits which must be obtained after the Closing
in order for Merger Co to operate the Schools as they are currently operated and
for the Schools to participate in all of the Student Financial Assistance
Programs, including the Title IV Programs, under the ownership of Merger Co
(collectively, the "Post-Closing Education Consents" identified as such in
Section 3.05(b)(vii) of the Company Disclosure Schedule); provided, however,
that the Company (including any of its Subsidiaries) shall not file any
application, notice or other submission to the DOE, any Education Department or
any Accrediting Body without providing Merger Co a reasonable opportunity to
review such application, notice or other submission and without obtaining the
consent of Merger Co (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned, or delayed). The Company and each of its Subsidiaries and Merger Co
will cooperate with each other and will take all commercially reasonable steps
to ensure that any response from the DOE to the DOE pre-acquisition review
application does not contain any of the conditions set forth in Section
7.02(f)(ii)(B).

          (d) The Company and Merger Co will promptly and regularly advise each
other concerning the occurrence and status of any discussions or other
communications, whether oral or written, with any Education Department,
Accrediting Body, or other third party with respect to any Pre-Closing Education
Consents or Post-Closing Education Consents, including any material difficulties
or material delays experienced in obtaining any such consent, and of any adverse
conditions proposed, considered, or requested with respect to any such consent.
Merger Co will cooperate fully with the Company in its efforts to obtain any
such consent, including the timely submission of any information or materials
requested by an Education Department or Accrediting Body with respect to
obtaining such consents. The Company will allow Merger Co's Representatives to
participate in any meetings or telephone calls with any Education Department or
Accrediting Body to discuss the status of any such consent and will not engage
in any such meetings or telephone calls without such participation (unless
Merger Co elects not to participate or fails to make its Representatives
reasonably available in a timely manner), provided, however, that the Company
and its Representatives will confer in advance with Merger Co and its
Representatives to agree on issues to be discussed in such meetings or telephone
calls and neither party nor its Representatives will introduce any issues that
are not agreed to in advance and will not respond to any compliance issues first
introduced in such meetings or telephone calls.

          6.10 Public Announcements. The initial press release relating to this
Agreement shall be a joint press release the text of which has been agreed to by
each of Merger Co and the Company. Thereafter, each of Merger Co and the Company
shall consult with each other before


                                      -49-

<PAGE>

issuing any press release or otherwise making any public statements with respect
to this Agreement or the Merger, except to the extent public disclosure is
required by applicable Law or the requirements of the NASD, in which case the
issuing party shall use its reasonable best efforts to consult with the other
party before issuing any such release or making any such public statement.

          6.11 Resignations. The Company shall use its reasonable best efforts
to obtain and deliver to Merger Co at the Closing evidence reasonably
satisfactory to Merger Co of the resignation effective, as of the Effective
Time, of those directors of the Company or any Subsidiary of the Company
designated by Merger Co to the Company in writing prior to the Closing.

          6.12 State Takeover Statutes. The Company and the Company Board shall
ensure that the PA Anti-Takeover Statutes are not applicable to this Agreement,
the Merger, or any of the Other Transactions and, if any PA Anti-Takeover
Statute becomes applicable to this Agreement, the Merger, or any of the Other
Transactions, shall ensure that the Merger, including the Other Transactions,
may be consummated as promptly as practicable on the terms contemplated by this
Agreement and otherwise to minimize the effect of such PA Anti-Takeover Statute
on the Merger and the Other Transactions, including the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement.

          6.13 Permits. The Company and each of its Subsidiaries shall provide
such additional assistance and cooperation to Merger Co as Merger Co shall
reasonably request in connection with the transfer, assignment, or conveyance of
any Permit, accreditation, authorization or approval to Merger Co hereunder.

          6.14 Credit Agreement. The Company shall take all actions reasonably
necessary to terminate, effective as of the Closing Date, the Credit Agreement,
including the repayment of all outstanding revolving credit loans (other than
Letters of Credit issued under the Credit Agreement which will remain in full
force and effect after the Closing Date). Merger Co shall arrange for the
issuance of "back-to-back" Letters of Credit in favor of National City Bank of
Pennsylvania with terms acceptable to National City Bank of Pennsylvania with

except in the case of the first sentence of Section 3.11) as though made on and
as of the Closing Date (except for representations and warranties made as of an

effect to any limitation on any representation and warranty indicated by a
materiality qualification, including the words "Company Material Adverse
Effect," "material," "in all material respects" or like words, except in the
case of the first sentence of Section 3.11) would not, individually or in the

consecutive Business Day period already referenced with respect to the
applicable event in Section 6.08(d)), then Merger Co shall not be obligated to
consummate the Merger for so long as such event is continuing, and thereafter
Merger Co shall not be obligated to consummate the Merger to the extent such
event constitutes a Market MAC in accordance with Section 6.08(d) (other than
any Market MAC in respect of which Merger Co has previously waived its right to

have a Company Material Adverse Effect.

          (ii) The Pre-Closing Education Consents marked with an asterisk in
Section 3.05(b)(vii) of the Company Disclosure Schedule shall have been obtained
without any limitations (other than any customary limitations generally imposed
by any Education Department or Accrediting Body in connection with its approval
of a change of ownership) (the "Pre-Closing Deficiencies") which taken together
with any Non-DOE Deficiencies and DOE Growth Limitations, would or would be
reasonably likely to, individually or in the aggregate, materially impair the
growth prospects of the Company and its Subsidiaries taken as a whole, and the
Company shall have received written responses from the DOE to the
pre-acquisition review applications and such written responses shall not include

change of ownership transactions as set forth in the standard form of
provisional program participation agreement) on an Institution's ability to open
new locations or add new educational programs or revise existing educational
programs (collectively under this clause (2), "DOE Growth Limitations") that,
taken together with any Pre-Closing Deficiencies and Non-DOE Deficiencies, would
or would be reasonably likely to, individually or in the aggregate, materially
impair the growth prospects of the Company and its Subsidiaries taken as a
whole, (3) any requirement that an Institution process its Title IV Program
funds under the DOE's reimbursement or heightened cash monitoring-level 2
procedures, or (4) any requirement that an Equity Investor assume any liability
for obligations arising out of the Company's or any Institutions participation
in or administration of the Title IV Programs;

shall have been informed in writing by any Education Department or Accrediting
Body that issues a Post-Closing Education Consent marked with a double-asterisk
in Schedule 3.5(b)(vii) of the Company Disclosure Schedules (i) that it will not
or does not expect to be able to issue its Post-Closing Education Consent or
(ii) that such Post-Closing Education Consent will or is reasonably likely to
have any limitations (other than any customary limitations generally imposed by
any

Education Department or Accrediting Body in connection with its approval of
change of ownership transactions) on any Institution (collectively under clauses
(i) and (ii), "Non-DOE Deficiencies"), which Non-DOE Deficiencies, taken
together with any Pre-Closing Deficiencies and DOE Growth Limitations, would or
would be reasonably likely to, individually or in the aggregate, materially
impair the growth prospects of the Company and its Subsidiaries taken as a
whole.

          (h) Resignations. Any resignations requested by Merger Co pursuant to

the Company to consummate the Merger are subject to the satisfaction or waiver
in writing (where permissible) of the following additional conditions:

          (a) Representations and Warranties. The representations and warranties
of Merger Co contained in this Agreement shall be true and correct in all
respects (without giving effect to any limitation on any representation and
warranty indicated by the words "Company Material Adverse Effect," "material,"
"in all material respects" or like words) as though made on and as of the
Closing Date (except for representations and warranties made as of an earlier
date, in which case as of such earlier date), except where the failure of such
representations and warranties to be so true or correct (without giving effect
to any limitation on any representation and warranty indicated by the words
"Company Material Adverse Effect," "material," "in all material respects" or
like words) would not prevent the consummation of the Merger or prevent Merger
Co from performing its obligations under this Agreement.

          (b) Agreements and Covenants. Merger Co shall have performed or
complied in all material respects with all agreements and covenants required by
this Agreement to be performed or complied with by it on or prior to the
Effective Time.

          (c) Officer's Certificate. Merger Co shall have delivered to the

                       TERMINATION, AMENDMENT, AND WAIVER

          8.01 Termination. This Agreement may be terminated and the Merger may
be abandoned at any time prior to the Effective Time by action taken or
authorized by the Board of Directors of the terminating party or parties,
notwithstanding any requisite adoption of this Agreement by the shareholders of
the Company, and whether before or after the Shareholder Approval, as follows
(the date of any such termination, the "Termination Date"):

          (a) by mutual written consent of Merger Co and the Company;

          (b) by either Merger Co or the Company if the Effective Time shall not
have occurred on or before the date that is six months from the date of this
Agreement; provided, however, that the right to terminate this Agreement under
this Section 8.01(b) shall not be


                                      -54-

<PAGE>

available to the party whose failure to fulfill any obligation under this
Agreement has been the cause of, or resulted in, the failure of the Effective
Time to occur on or before such date;

          (c) by either Merger Co or the Company if any Governmental Entity or
Education Department shall have enacted, issued, promulgated, enforced, or
entered any injunction, order, decree, or ruling or taken any other action
(including the failure to have taken an action) which has become final and
non-appealable and has the effect of making consummation of the Merger illegal
or otherwise preventing or prohibiting consummation of the Merger;

          (d) by Merger Co if it is not in material breach of its obligations
under this Agreement, and if (i) any of the representations and warranties of
the Company herein are or become untrue or inaccurate such that Section 7.02(a)
would not be satisfied, or (ii) there has been a breach on the part of the
Company of any of its covenants or agreements herein such that Section 7.02(b)
would not be satisfied, and, in either such case, such breach has not been, or
cannot be, cured within 30 days after written notice to the Company;

          (e) by the Company if it is not in material breach of its obligations
under this Agreement, and if (i) any of the representations and warranties of
Merger Co herein are or become untrue or inaccurate such that Section 7.03(a)
would not be satisfied, or (ii) there has been a breach on the part of Merger Co
of any of its covenants or agreements herein such that Section 7.03(b) would not
be satisfied, and, in either such case, such breach (other than as a result of a
breach by Merger Co to effect the Closing as and when required by Section 1.02)
has not been, or cannot be, cured within 30 days after written notice to Merger
Co;

          (f) by either Merger Co or the Company if this Agreement shall fail to
receive the Shareholder Approval at the Company Shareholders' Meeting; provided,
however, that the Company may not terminate under this Section 8.01(f) if it is
in material breach of its obligations under Sections 6.01, 6.02, or 6.04;

          (g) by Merger Co if the Company Board shall have (i) effected a Change
of Board Recommendation, (ii) recommended to its shareholders or approved any
Acquisition Proposal, (iii) within five Business Days of the date any
Acquisition Proposal is first published or sent or given, taken any position
contemplated by Rule 14e-2(a) of the Exchange Act other than recommending
rejection of such Acquisition Proposal or (iv) failed to include in the Proxy
Statement distributed to shareholders its recommendation that shareholders adopt
and approve this Agreement and the Merger, provided, however, it is understood
that any "stop-look-and-listen" communication by the Company Board to the
Company's shareholders pursuant to Section 14d-9(f) of the Exchange Act that
does not take a position with respect to an Acquisition Proposal shall not be
deemed to constitute a withdrawal, modification, or change of its recommendation
of this Agreement or the Merger;

          (h) by the Company if, prior to the adoption of this Agreement at the
Company Shareholders' Meeting, the Company Board determines in good faith (after
consultation with its advisors) that an unsolicited bona fide Acquisition
Proposal is a Superior Proposal but only (i) after providing written notice to
Merger Co (a "Notice of Superior Proposal") advising Merger Co that the Company
Board has received a Superior Proposal, specifying in writing the material


                                      -55-

<PAGE>

terms and conditions of such Superior Proposal and the identifying the person
making the proposal, and (ii) if Merger Co does not, within two Business Days of
Merger Co's receipt of the Notice of Superior Proposal, make an offer that the
Company Board determines, in its good faith judgment (after consultation with
its advisors) to be at least as favorable to the Company's shareholders as such
Superior Proposal; provided, however, that during such two Business Day period,
the Company shall cooperate and negotiate with Merger Co (to the extent Merger
Co wishes such cooperation) to enable Merger Co to make such an offer; provided,
further, that, in the event of any amendment to the financial or other material
terms of such Superior Proposal, the Company Board shall deliver to Merger Co an
additional written Notice of Superior Proposal, and the two Business Day period
referenced above shall be extended for an additional two Business Days after
Merger Co's receipt of such additional Notice of Superior Proposal; and
provided, further, that any such purported termination pursuant to this Section
8.01(h) shall be void and of no force and effect unless the Company concurrently
with such termination pays the Company Termination Fee as directed by the Merger
Co in writing in accordance with Section 8.03; or

          (i) by the Company within ten Business Days after the expiration of a
Requisite Period, if Merger Co fails to deliver a Merger Co Waiver Notice prior
to the expiration of the Requisite Response Period with respect to any Market
MAC.

          8.02 Effect of Termination. In the event of the termination of this
Agreement pursuant to Section 8.01, this Agreement shall forthwith become void,
except that (i) the provisions of Section 6.03(b), Section 6.08(b), Section
6.16, this Section 8.02, Section 8.03, and Article 9 and the Guaranties referred
to in Section 4.09 shall survive any such termination and (ii) subject to the
other provisions of this Agreement (including Section 9.07), no such termination
shall relieve any party of any liability resulting from any breach by that party
of this Agreement.

          8.03 Fees and Expenses.

          (a) Except as otherwise set forth in this Section 8.03, all Expenses

Agreement, "Expenses" includes all reasonable out-of-pocket documented expenses
(including all fees and expenses of counsel, accountants, investment bankers,

Affiliates) incurred by a party or on its behalf in connection with or related
to the authorization, preparation, negotiation, execution, and performance of
this Agreement, the preparation, printing, filing, and mailing of the Proxy
Statement, the solicitation of the Shareholder Approval, financing, and all
other matters related to the Merger and the Other Transactions.

          (b) If this Agreement shall be terminated:

               (i) by Merger Co pursuant to Section 8.01(d), if (A) at or prior
to the Termination Date, an Acquisition Proposal shall have been publicly
announced or disclosed to the Company in writing and (B) no later than 12 months
after the Termination Date, the Company enters into, recommends or submits to
the shareholders of the Company for adoption or acceptance, an Acquisition
Proposal or an agreement with respect to such Acquisition


                                      -56-

<PAGE>

Proposal (which in each case need not be the same Acquisition Proposal as the
Acquisition Proposal described above that shall have been publicly announced at
or prior to the Termination Date), and an Acquisition Proposal is consummated,
then the Company shall pay the Company Termination Fee as provided in Section
8.03(c);

               (ii) by Merger Co or the Company pursuant to Section 8.01(f), if
(A) at or prior to the Termination Date, an Acquisition Proposal shall have been

Proposal described above that shall have been publicly announced at or prior to
the Termination Date), and an Acquisition Proposal is consummated, then the
Company shall pay the Company Termination Fee as provided in Section 8.03(c);

               (iii) by Merger Co pursuant to Section 8.01(g), then the Company
shall pay the Company Termination Fee as provided in Section 8.03(c); or

               (iv) by the Company pursuant to Section 8.01(h), then the Company
shall pay the Company Termination Fee as provided in Section 8.03(c).

          (c) The Company Termination Fee shall be paid by the Company as
directed by Merger Co in writing in immediately available funds (i) concurrently
with and as a condition to the effectiveness of a termination of this Agreement
by the Company pursuant to Section 8.01(h) and (ii) within two Business Days
after the date of the event giving rise to the obligation to make such payment
in all other circumstances. The Merger Co Termination Fee (as defined below)
shall be paid by Merger Co as directed by the Company in writing in immediately
available funds within two Business Days after the date of the event giving rise
to the obligation to make such payment.

          (d) For purposes of this Agreement, (i) "Company Termination Fee"
means an aggregate amount in cash equal to $84,000,000 and (ii) "Merger Co
Termination Fee" means an aggregate amount in cash equal to $84,000,000.

          (e) If this Agreement shall be terminated by the Company (i) pursuant
to Section 8.01(e)(ii) as a result of a breach by Merger Co of its obligations
to effect the Closing if and when required by Section 1.02, then Merger Co shall
pay the Merger Co Termination Fee as provided in Section 8.03(c).

          (f) Each of the Company and Merger Co acknowledges that the agreements
contained in this Section 8.03 are an integral part of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement. In the event that the Company shall fail to pay
the Company Termination Fee when due or Merger Co shall fail to pay Merger Co
Termination Fee when due, the Company or Merger Co, as the case may be, shall
reimburse the other party for all reasonable costs and expenses actually
incurred or accrued by such other party (including reasonable fees and expenses
of counsel) in connection with the collection under and enforcement of this
Section 8.03.
