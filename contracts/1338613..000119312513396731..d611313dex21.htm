Exchange Agent, as agent for the holders of Common Units or Class B Units that would otherwise receive fractional Parent Units, shall sell the Excess Units at then-prevailing prices on the NYSE in the manner provided in this

such Common Units and Class B Units shall be entitled, if any, by multiplying the amount of the aggregate unit proceeds comprising the Fractional Unit Proceeds by a fraction, the numerator of which is the amount of the fractional unit interest to

local or foreign Tax Law (and to the extent deduction and withholding is required, such deduction and withholding shall be taken in Parent Units). To the extent amounts are so withheld and paid over to the appropriate Tax authority, such withheld
amounts shall be treated for the purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the former holder of the Common Units, Class B Units, Restricted Units, Phantom Units (and distribution equivalent rights) and Deferred Common Units, as applicable,
in respect of whom such withholding was made. If withholding is taken in Parent Units, Parent and the Exchange Agent shall be treated as having sold such consideration for an amount of cash equal to the fair market value of such consideration at the

federal income Tax purposes as a contribution of all of the assets of MLP to Parent in exchange for the Merger Consideration, the cash received in lieu of fractional Parent Units and the assumption of liabilities. To the maximum extent possible, the
