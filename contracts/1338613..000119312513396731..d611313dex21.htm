Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby. 

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the representations, warranties, covenants
and agreements contained in this Agreement, and intending to be legally
bound, the parties agree as follows:

ARTICLE I

 

 _The Merger_

 

Section 1.1 _The Merger_. Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set
forth in this Agreement, and in accordance with the DRULPA and the DLLCA, at
the Effective Time, Merger Sub shall be merged with and into MLP (the "
_Merger_ "), the separate limited liability company existence of Merger Sub
will cease, and MLP will continue its existence as a limited partnership
under Delaware law as the surviving entity in the Merger (the " _Surviving
Entity_ "). Section 1.2 _Closing_. Subject to the provisions of _Article VI_ , the closing
of the Merger (the " _Closing_ ") shall take place at the offices of Baker
Botts L.L.P., 2001 Ross Avenue, Dallas, Texas 75201 at 9:00 A.M., local time,
on the second business day after the satisfaction or waiver of the conditions
set forth in _Article VI_ (other than conditions that by their nature are to
be satisfied at the Closing, but subject to the satisfaction or waiver of
those conditions), or at such other place, date and time as MLP and Parent
shall agree. The date on which the Closing actually occurs is referred to as
the " _Closing Date_."

Section 1.3 _Effective Time_. Subject to the provisions of this Agreement, at
the Closing, MLP will cause a certificate of merger, executed in accordance
with the relevant provisions of the DRULPA and the DLLCA (the " _Certificate
of Merger_ ") to be duly filed with the Secretary of State of the State of
Delaware. The Merger will become effective at such time as the Certificate of
Merger has been duly filed with the Secretary of State of the State of
Delaware or at such later date or time as may be agreed by MLP and Parent in
writing and specified in the Certificate of Merger (the effective time of the
Merger being hereinafter referred to as the " _Effective Time_ ").

 

Section 1.4 _Effects of the Merger_. The Merger shall have the effects set
forth in the applicable provisions of the DRULPA and the DLLCA.

Section 1.5 _Organizational Documents of the Surviving Entity_.

 

(a) At the Effective Time, the certificate of limited partnership of MLP as in
effect immediately prior to the Effective Time shall remain unchanged and
shall be the certificate of limited partnership of the Surviving Entity from
and after the Effective Time, and thereafter may be amended as provided
therein or by Law, in each case consistent with the obligations set forth in 
_Section 5.8_.

(b) The MLP Partnership Agreement shall, by virtue of the Merger and the
Certificate of Merger, be amended and restated in its entirety as set forth
in _Exhibit A_ hereto, and thereafter may be amended as provided therein or by
Law, in each case consistent with the obligations set forth in _Section 5.8_.

 

ARTICLE II

_Effect on Units_

Section 2.1 _Effect of Merger_. At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger
and without any action on the part of MLP GP, MLP, Parent GP, Parent, Merger
Sub or the holder of any securities of MLP or Merger Sub:

(a) _Conversion of Common Units and Class B Units_. Subject to _Section
2.1(c)_, _Section 2.2(h)_ and _Section 2.4_, each Common Unit and each Class
B Unit issued and outstanding or deemed issued and outstanding in accordance
with  _Section 2.3_ as of immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be
converted into the right to receive (i) an amount of cash equal to the
difference (if positive) between (x) the Annualized MLP Distribution minus (y)
the Annualized Adjusted Parent Distribution (the " _Cash Consideration_ ")
and (ii) 1.020 (the " _Exchange Ratio_ ") Parent Units (the " _Unit
Consideration_ " and, together with the Cash Consideration, the " _Merger
Consideration_ ").

 



2 (b) _Limited Partner Interests of the Surviving Entity_. At the Effective
Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of Parent,
the membership interests in Merger Sub issued and outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective Time shall be converted into a 100% limited partner
interest in MLP (as the Surviving Entity). At the Effective Time, the books
and records of MLP shall be revised to reflect the admission of Parent as a
Limited Partner of MLP and the simultaneous withdrawal of all other Limited
Partners of MLP.

 

(c) _Cancellation of MLP-Owned Units and Parent-Owned Units_. Any MLP
Securities that are owned immediately prior to the Effective Time by MLP or
any Subsidiary of MLP, and any MLP Securities owned immediately prior to the
Effective Time by Parent or any Subsidiary of Parent, shall be automatically
canceled and shall cease to exist and no consideration shall be delivered in
exchange for such canceled MLP Securities.

(d) _Certificates_. As of the Effective Time, all Common Units and Class B
Units converted into the Merger Consideration pursuant to this _Article II_
shall no longer be outstanding and shall automatically be canceled and shall
cease to exist, and each holder of a certificate (or evidence of units in
book-entry form) that immediately prior to the Effective Time represented any
such Common Units or Class B Units (a " _Certificate_ ") shall cease to have
any rights with respect thereto, except the right to receive the Merger
Consideration, any distributions to which such holder is entitled pursuant to
_Section 2.2(g)_ and cash in lieu of any fractional Parent Units to which
such holder is entitled pursuant to _Section 2.2(h)_, in each case to be
issued or paid in consideration therefor upon surrender of such Certificate
in accordance with _Section 2.2(c)_, without interest, and the right to be
admitted as a Parent Limited Partner. Parent GP hereby consents to the
admission (as a Parent Limited Partner) of each Unitholder who is issued
Parent Units in exchange for such Unitholders Common Units or Class B Units
in accordance with this _Article II_ , upon the proper surrender of the
Certificate representing such Common Units or Class B Units. Upon such
surrender of the Certificate (or upon a waiver of the requirement to
surrender a Certificate granted by Parent GP in its sole discretion) and the
recording of the name of such Person as a limited partner of Parent on the
books and records of Parent, such Person shall automatically and effective as
of the Effective Time be admitted as a Parent Limited Partner and be bound by
the Parent Partnership Agreement as such. By its surrender of a Certificate,
or by its acceptance of Parent Units, a Unitholder confirms its agreement to
be bound by all of the terms and conditions of the Parent Partnership
Agreement.

 



3 Section 2.2 _Exchange of Certificates_.

 

(a) _Exchange Agent_. Prior to the Closing Date, Parent shall appoint an
exchange agent reasonably acceptable to MLP (the " _Exchange Agent_ ") for
the purpose of exchanging Certificates for the Merger Consideration. As soon
as reasonably practicable after the Effective Time, but in no event more than
three business days following the Effective Time, Parent will send, or will
cause the Exchange Agent to send, to each holder of record of Common Units and
Class B Units as of the Effective Time (and, to the extent commercially
practicable, to make available for collection by hand, during
customary business hours commencing immediately after the Effective Time, if
so elected by such holder of record), whose Common Units and Class B Units,
were converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration, a letter of
transmittal (which shall specify that the delivery shall be effected, and
risk of loss and title shall pass, only upon proper delivery of the
Certificates (or effective affidavits of loss in lieu thereof) to the Exchange
Agent) in such forms as MLP and Parent may reasonably agree, including, as
applicable, instructions for use in effecting the surrender of Certificates
(or effective affidavits of loss in lieu thereof) to the Exchange Agent in
exchange for the Merger Consideration and cash in lieu of any
fractional Parent Units payable pursuant to _Section 2.2(h)_.

(b) _Deposit_. At or prior to the Closing, Parent shall cause to be deposited
with the Exchange Agent, in trust for the benefit of the holders of Common
Units, Class B Units, Restricted Units, Phantom Units (and distribution
equivalent rights) and Deferred Common Units, an amount of Parent Units (which
shall be in non-certificated book-entry form) and an amount of cash in U.S.
dollars sufficient to be issued and paid pursuant to _Section 2.1(a)(i)_ and
_Section 2.3(a)_, payable upon due surrender of the Certificates or other
evidence of Restricted Units, Phantom Units (and distribution equivalent
rights) and Deferred Common Units (or effective affidavits of loss in lieu
thereof) pursuant to the provisions of this _Article II_. Following the
Effective Time, Parent agrees to make available to the Exchange Agent, from
time to time as needed, cash in U.S. dollars sufficient to pay any
distributions pursuant to _Section 2.2(g)_ and any Parent Units sufficient to
pay any Merger Consideration, in each case, that may be payable from time to
time following the Effective Time. All cash and book-entry units representing
Parent Units deposited with the Exchange Agent or representing unit proceeds
obtained pursuant to _Section 2.2(h)_ shall be referred to in this Agreement
as the " _Exchange Fund_." The Exchange Agent shall, pursuant to irrevocable
instructions, deliver the Merger Consideration contemplated to be issued or
paid pursuant to this _Article II_ out of the Exchange Fund. The Exchange
Fund shall not be used for any other purpose. The Exchange Agent shall invest
any cash included in the Exchange Fund as directed by Parent; _provided_ that
(i) no such investment or losses thereon shall affect the
Merger Consideration payable to holders of Common Units, Class B Units,
Restricted Units, Phantom Units (and distribution equivalent rights) or
Deferred Common Units entitled to receive such consideration or cash in lieu
of fractional interests, or in respect of distribution equivalent rights,
pursuant to _Section 2.3(a)_ and Parent shall promptly cause to be provided
additional funds to the Exchange Agent for the benefit of holders of Common
Units, Class B Units, Restricted Units, Phantom Units (and distribution
equivalent rights) or Deferred Common Units entitled to receive such
consideration in the amount of any such losses; and (ii) such investments
shall be in short-term obligations of the United States of America with
maturities of no more than 30 days.

 



4 (c) _Exchange_. Each holder of Common Units and Class B Units that have been
converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration, upon surrender
to the Exchange Agent of a properly completed letter of transmittal, duly
executed and completed in accordance with the instructions thereto, a
Certificate (as applicable) and such other documents as may reasonably be
required by the Exchange Agent, will be entitled to receive in exchange
therefor (i) the number of Parent Units representing, in the aggregate, the
whole number of Parent Units that such holder has the right to receive in
accordance with the provisions of this _Article II_ and/or (ii) a check
denominated in U.S. dollars in the amount of cash that such holder has the
right to receive pursuant to this _Article II_, including the
Cash Consideration. The Merger Consideration shall be paid as promptly as
practicable by mail after receipt by the Exchange Agent of the Certificate and
letter of transmittal in accordance with the foregoing. No interest shall be
paid or accrued on any Merger Consideration, cash in lieu of fractional
Parent Units or in respect of distribution equivalent rights or on any unpaid
distributions payable to holders of Certificates. Until so surrendered, each
such Certificate shall, after the Effective Time, represent for all purposes
only the right to receive such Merger Consideration. The Merger Consideration
paid upon surrender of Certificates shall be deemed to have been paid in full
satisfaction of all rights pertaining to the Common Units or Class B Units,
as the case may be, formerly represented by such Certificates.

(d) _Other Payees_. If any cash payment is to be made to a Person other than
the Person in whose name the applicable surrendered Certificate is registered,
it shall be a condition of such payment that the Person requesting such
payment shall pay any transfer or other similar Taxes required by reason
of the making of such cash payment to a Person other than the registered
holder of the surrendered Certificate or shall establish to the satisfaction
of the Exchange Agent that such Tax has been paid or is not payable. If any
portion of the Merger Consideration is to be registered in the name of a
Person other than the Person in whose name the applicable surrendered
Certificate is registered, it shall be a condition to the registration thereof
that the surrendered Certificate shall be properly endorsed or otherwise be
in proper form for transfer and that the Person requesting such delivery of
the Merger Consideration shall pay to the Exchange Agent any transfer or other
similar Taxes required as a result of such registration in the name of a
Person other than the registered holder of such Certificate or establish to
the satisfaction of the Exchange Agent that such Tax has been paid or is not
payable.

 

(e) _No Further Transfers_. From and after the Effective Time, there shall be
no further registration on the books of MLP of transfers of Common Units or
Class B Units. From and after the Effective Time, the holders of Certificates
representing Common Units or Class B Units outstanding immediately prior to
the Effective Time shall cease to have any rights with respect to such
Common Units or Class B Units, except as otherwise provided in this Agreement
or by applicable Law. If, after the Effective Time, Certificates are presented
to the Exchange Agent or Parent, they shall be canceled and exchanged for the
consideration provided for, and in accordance with the procedures set forth,
in this _Article II_.

(f) _Termination of Exchange Fund_. Any portion of the Exchange Fund that
remains unclaimed by the holders of Common Units or Class B Units 12 months
after the

 



5  Effective Time shall be returned to Parent, upon demand, and any such holder
who has not exchanged his, her or its Common Units or Class B Units for the
Merger Consideration in accordance with this _Section 2.2_ prior to that
time shall thereafter look only to Parent for delivery of the Merger
Consideration in respect of such holders Common Units or Class B Units.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, Parent, Merger Sub and MLP shall not be liable
to any holder of Common Units or Class B Units for any Merger Consideration
duly delivered to a public official pursuant to applicable abandoned property
Laws. Any Merger Consideration remaining unclaimed by holders of Common Units
or Class B Units immediately prior to such time as such amounts would
otherwise escheat to, or become property of, any Governmental Authority shall,
to the extent permitted by applicable Law, become the property of Parent free
and clear of any claims or interest of any Person previously entitled
thereto.

(g) _Distributions_. No distributions with respect to Parent Units issued in
the Merger shall be paid to the holder of any unsurrendered Certificates until
such Certificates are surrendered as provided in this _Section 2.2_.
Following such surrender, subject to the effect of escheat, Tax or
other applicable Law, there shall be paid, without interest, to the record
holder of the Parent Units, if any, issued in exchange therefor (i) at the
time of such surrender, all distributions payable in respect of any such
Parent Units with a record date after the Effective Time and a payment date
on or prior to the date of such surrender and not previously paid and (ii) at
the appropriate payment date, the distributions payable with respect to such
Parent Units with a record date after the Effective Time but with a payment
date subsequent to such surrender. For purposes of distributions in respect of
Parent Units, all Parent Units to be issued pursuant to the Merger shall be
entitled to distributions pursuant to the immediately preceding sentence as
if issued and outstanding as of the Effective Time.

(h) _No Fractional Units_. No certificates or scrip representing fractional
Parent Units shall be issued upon the surrender for exchange of Certificates.
Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, each holder of Common
Units or Class B Units converted pursuant to the Merger who would otherwise
have been entitled to receive a fraction of a Parent Unit (after taking into
account all Certificates (or effective affidavits of loss in lieu thereof)
delivered by such holder) shall be entitled to receive, from the Exchange
Agent in accordance with the provisions of this _Section 2.2(h)_, a cash
payment, without interest, in lieu of such fractional units representing such
holders proportionate interest, if any, in the proceeds from the sale by the
Exchange Agent (reduced by reasonable and customary fees of the Exchange
Agent attributable to such sale) (as so reduced, the " _unit proceeds_ ") in
one or more transactions of a number of Parent Units, such number equal to the
excess of (i) the aggregate number of Parent Units to be delivered to the
Exchange Agent by Parent pursuant to _Section 2.2(b)_ over (ii) the aggregate
number of whole Parent Units to be distributed to the holders of Certificates
pursuant to  _Section 2.2(c)_ (such excess, the " _Excess Units_ "). The
parties acknowledge that payment of the cash unit proceeds in lieu of issuing
certificates or scrip for fractional units was not separately bargained-
for consideration but merely represents a mechanical rounding off for
purposes of avoiding the expense and inconvenience to Parent that would
otherwise be caused by the issuance of fractional units. As soon as
practicable after the Effective Time, the Exchange Agent, as agent for the
holders of Common Units or Class B Units that would otherwise receive
fractional Parent Units, shall sell the Excess Units at then-prevailing prices
on the NYSE in the manner provided in this  _Section 2.2(h)_ and such sales
shall be executed in round lots to the extent practicable.

 



6  Until the unit proceeds of such sale or sales have been distributed to the
holders of such Common Units or Class B Units, or the Exchange Fund is
terminated, the Exchange Agent shall hold such unit proceeds in trust for the
benefit of the holders of such Common Units and Class B Units (the "
_Fractional Unit Proceeds_ "). The Exchange Agent shall determine the portion
of the Fractional Unit Proceeds to which each holder of such Common Units and
Class B Units shall be entitled, if any, by multiplying the amount of the
aggregate unit proceeds comprising the Fractional Unit Proceeds by a fraction,
the numerator of which is the amount of the fractional unit interest to which
such holder of such Common Units or Class B Units would otherwise be entitled
and the denominator of which is the aggregate amount of fractional unit
interests to which all holders of such Common Units would otherwise be
entitled.

 

(i) _Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates_. If any Certificate shall have
been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact
by the Person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and,
if required by Parent, the posting by such Person of a bond, in such
reasonable amount as Parent may direct, as indemnity against any claim that
may be made against it with respect to such Certificate, the Exchange Agent
will issue in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate the
Merger Consideration to be paid in respect of the Common Units represented by
such Certificate as contemplated by this _Article II_.

(j) _Withholding Taxes_. Parent, Merger Sub and the Exchange Agent shall
deduct and withhold from the consideration otherwise payable pursuant to this
Agreement to a holder of Common Units, Class B Units, Restricted Units,
Phantom Units (and any distribution equivalent rights) and Deferred Common
Units such amounts as are required to be deducted and withheld with respect
to the making of such payment under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as
amended (the " _Code_ "), and the rules and regulations promulgated
thereunder, or under any provision of applicable state, local or foreign Tax
Law (and to the extent deduction and withholding is required, such deduction
and withholding shall be taken in Parent Units). To the extent amounts are so
withheld and paid over to the appropriate Tax authority, such
withheld amounts shall be treated for the purposes of this Agreement as
having been paid to the former holder of the Common Units, Class B Units,
Restricted Units, Phantom Units (and distribution equivalent rights) and
Deferred Common Units, as applicable, in respect of whom such withholding was
made. If withholding is taken in Parent Units, Parent and the Exchange Agent
shall be treated as having sold such consideration for an amount of cash equal
to the fair market value of such consideration at the time of such deemed
sale and paid such cash proceeds to the appropriate Tax authority.

(k) _Tax Characterization of Merger and Cash Received_. MLP and Parent each
acknowledges and agrees that for federal income Tax purposes the transactions
consummated pursuant to this Agreement will be treated as an "assets-over"
partnership merger transaction under Treasury Regulations Sections
1.708-1(c)(1) and 1.708-1(c)(3)(i), whereby MLP will be the terminating
partnership and Parent will be the resulting partnership. As a result, the
transactions consummated pursuant to this Agreement shall be treated for
U.S. federal income Tax purposes as a contribution of all of the assets of
MLP to Parent in exchange for the Merger Consideration, the cash received in
lieu of fractional Parent Units and the assumption of liabilities. To the
maximum extent possible, the Cash Consideration and any cash received in lieu
of fractional Parent Units shall be treated as a reimbursement of preformation
capital

 



7  expenditures described in Treasury Regulation Section 1.707-4(d). To the
extent the Cash Consideration and any cash received in lieu of fractional
Parent Units exceeds the amount that can be so treated, such excess cash will
be treated as proceeds of a disguised sale transaction described in Section
707(a)(2)(B) of the Code (a " _Disguised Sale_ "). Each of MLP and Parent
agrees to prepare and file all U.S. federal income Tax Returns in accordance
with the foregoing and shall not take any position inconsistent therewith on
any such Tax Return, or in the course of any audit, litigation or other
proceeding with respect to U.S. federal income Taxes, except as otherwise
required by applicable Laws following a final determination by a court of
competent jurisdiction or other final administrative decision by an applicable
Governmental Authority.

 

Section 2.3 _Treatment of Phantom Units, Restricted Units and Deferred Common
Units; Equity Plans_. As soon as reasonably practicable following the date of
this Agreement, and in any event prior to the Effective Time, the MLP GP Board
(or, if appropriate, any committee administering any MLP Equity Plan) will
adopt resolutions, and MLP will take all other actions as may be necessary or
required in accordance with applicable Law and each MLP Equity Plan
(including, the award agreements in respect of awards granted thereunder) to
give effect to this _Section 2.3_ to provide that:

 

(a) _Treatment of Phantom Units_. Except as otherwise expressly provided in
the original grant terms of a particular award, each Phantom Unit that is
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall, as of the Effective
Time, automatically and without any action on the part of the holder thereof,
vest in full (in the case of performance-based Phantom Units, based
on achievement of target level of performance) and the restrictions with
respect thereto shall lapse, and each Common Unit deemed to be issued in
settlement thereof shall be deemed issued and outstanding as of immediately
prior to the Effective Time and otherwise subject to the terms and conditions
of this Agreement (including _Sections 2.1_ and _2.2_ ). In addition, any
then-accumulated distribution equivalents payable pursuant to distribution
equivalent rights with respect to each Phantom Unit that vests pursuant to
this _Section 2.3(a)_ shall, as of the Effective Time, automatically and
without any action on the part of the holder thereof, vest in full and shall
become immediately payable in cash.

 

(b) _Treatment of Restricted Units_. Each Restricted Unit that is outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall, as of the Effective Time,
automatically and without any action on the part of the holder thereof, vest
in full and the restrictions with respect thereto shall lapse, and each
Restricted Unit shall be treated as an issued and outstanding Common Unit as
of immediately prior to the Effective Time and otherwise subject to the terms
and conditions of this Agreement (including _Sections 2.1_ and _2.2_ ).

 

(c) _Treatment of Deferred Common Units_. Restrictions with respect to each
Deferred Common Unit that is outstanding immediately prior to the Effective
Time shall, as of the Effective Time, automatically and without any action on
the part of the holder thereof, lapse, and each Deferred Common Unit shall be
treated as an issued and outstanding Common Unit as of immediately prior to
the Effective Time and otherwise subject to the terms and conditions of this
Agreement (including _Sections 2.1_ and _2.2_ ).

 



8 (d) _Assumption of MLP Equity Plans_. As of the Effective Time, Parent shall
assume the obligations of MLP under the MLP Equity Plans and shall assume
such plans for purposes of employing such plans to make grants of equity based
awards on Parent Units following the Closing.

 

Section 2.4 _Adjustments_. Notwithstanding any provision of this Article II to
the contrary (but without in any way limiting the covenants in _Section
5.2_), if between the date of this Agreement and the Effective Time the number
of outstanding Common Units, Class B Units or Parent Units shall have been
changed into a different number of units or a different class by reason of
the occurrence or record date of any unit dividend, subdivision,
reclassification, recapitalization, split, split-up, unit distribution (except
in the case of distributions of PIK Units in the ordinary course and in
accordance with Section 5.9(d) of the MLP Partnership Agreement),
combination, exchange of units or similar transaction, each of the Cash
Consideration and the Exchange Ratio shall be appropriately adjusted to
reflect fully the effect of such unit dividend, subdivision,
reclassification, split, combination, exchange of units or similar transaction
and to provide the holders of Common Units and Class B Units the same economic
effect as contemplated by this Agreement prior to such event.

 

Section 2.5 _No Dissenters  Rights_. No dissenters or appraisal rights shall
be available with respect to the Merger or the other transactions
contemplated hereby.

(other than any factual information contained within such headings,
disclosure or statements)) or (b) the disclosure letter delivered by MLP to
Parent (the " _MLP Disclosure Schedule_ ") prior to the execution of this
Agreement ( _provided_ that (i) disclosure in any section of such MLP
Disclosure Schedule shall be deemed to be disclosed with respect to any other
section of this Agreement to the extent that it is reasonably apparent on the
face of such disclosure that it is applicable to such other section
notwithstanding the omission of a reference or cross reference thereto and
(ii) the mere inclusion of an item in such MLP Disclosure Schedule as an
exception to a representation or warranty shall not be deemed an admission
that such item represents a material exception or material fact, event or
circumstance or that such item has had, would have or would reasonably be
expected to have, an MLP Material Adverse Effect), MLP represents and warrants
to Parent as follows:

 

Section 3.1 _Organization, Standing and Power_.

 

(a) Each of MLP and its Subsidiaries is a legal entity duly organized, validly

partnership, corporate, limited liability company or other applicable power
and authority necessary to own or lease all of its properties and assets and
to carry on its business as it is now being conducted, except where the
failure to have such power or authority would not, individually or in the
aggregate, have a Material Adverse Effect on MLP (an " _MLP Material
Adverse Effect_ ").

 



9 (b) Each of MLP and its Subsidiaries is duly licensed or qualified to do
business and is in good standing in each jurisdiction in which the nature of
the business conducted by it or the character or location of the properties
and assets owned or leased by it makes such licensing or qualification
necessary, except where the failure to be so licensed, qualified or in good
standing would not, individually or in the aggregate, have an MLP Material
Adverse Effect.

interests, shares of capital stock of, or other equity interests in, each
material Subsidiary of MLP that are owned directly or indirectly by MLP have
been duly authorized and validly issued and are fully paid and nonassessable

encumbrances, options, rights of first refusal or other preferential purchase
rights, adverse rights or claims and security interests of any kind or nature
whatsoever (including any restriction on the right to vote or transfer the

_Liens_ "). Except for those of the MLP Joint Ventures, all such interests
and shares of capital stock of each Subsidiary are owned directly or
indirectly by MLP.

(d) MLP has made available to Parent correct and complete copies of its
certificate of limited partnership and the MLP Partnership Agreement (the "
_MLP Charter Documents_ "), and correct and complete copies of the comparable

and MLP is not in violation of any of their provisions.

other equity interests of MLP issued and outstanding or any subscriptions,
options, warrants, calls, convertible or exchangeable securities, rights,
commitments or agreements of any character providing for the issuance of any
Partnership Interests or other partnership interests, voting securities or
other equity interests of MLP, including any representing the right to
purchase or otherwise receive any of the foregoing.

(b) Since the Balance Sheet Date to the date of this Agreement, MLP has not
issued any Partnership Interests or other partnership interests, voting
securities or other equity interests, or any securities convertible into or

any character providing for the issuance or disposition of any partnership
interests, shares of capital stock, voting securities or equity interests of

Liens.

Section 3.3  _Authority; Noncontravention; Voting Requirements_.

(a) Each of the MLP Entities has all necessary power and authority to
execute and deliver this Agreement and to consummate the transactions
contemplated hereby, subject to obtaining the MLP Unitholder Approval. The
execution, delivery and performance by the MLP Entities of this Agreement, and
the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby, have been duly

and the transactions contemplated hereby and (ii) resolved to submit the
Agreement to a vote of the Limited Partners of MLP and to recommend adoption
of this Agreement by the Limited Partners of MLP, and except for obtaining the
MLP Unitholder Approval for the adoption of this Agreement, and consummation
of the transactions contemplated hereby, no other entity action on the part of
the MLP Entities is necessary to authorize the execution, delivery and
performance by the MLP Entities of this Agreement and the consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby. This Agreement has been duly executed and
delivered by the MLP Entities and, assuming due authorization, execution and
delivery of this Agreement by the other parties hereto, constitutes a legal,
valid and binding obligation of each of the MLP Entities, enforceable against
each of them in accordance with its terms.

(b) Neither the execution and delivery of this Agreement by the MLP Entities
nor the consummation by the MLP Entities of the transactions contemplated
hereby, nor compliance by the MLP Entities with any of the terms or provisions
of this Agreement, will (i) conflict with or violate any provision of the MLP
Charter Documents or any of the MLP Subsidiary Documents, (ii) assuming that
the authorizations, consents and approvals referred to in _Section 3.4_ and
the MLP Unitholder Approval are obtained and the filings referred to in
_Section 3.4_ are made, (x) violate any Law, judgment, writ or injunction of
any Governmental Authority applicable to MLP or any of its Subsidiaries or any
of their respective properties or assets, or (y) violate, conflict with,

which, with notice or lapse of time, or both, would constitute a default)
under, result in the termination of or a right of termination or cancellation
under, accelerate the performance required by, or result in the creation of
any Lien upon any of the respective properties or assets of, MLP or any of its
Subsidiaries under any of the terms, conditions or provisions of any loan or 

 



12  credit agreement, debenture, note, bond, mortgage, indenture, deed of trust,
license, lease, contract or other agreement, instrument or obligation (each, a
" _Contract_ ") or MLP Permit (including any Environmental Permit) to which
MLP or any of its Subsidiaries is a party, or by which they or any of their
respective properties or assets may be bound or affected or (iii) result in
the exercisability of any right to purchase or acquire any material asset of
MLP or any of its Subsidiaries, except, in the case of clauses (ii)(x) and
(ii)(y), for such violations, conflicts, losses, defaults, terminations,
cancellations, accelerations or Liens as, individually or in the aggregate,
would not reasonably be expected to have an MLP Material Adverse Effect.

(c) The affirmative vote or consent of the holders of a Unit Majority at the
MLP Unitholders Meeting or any adjournment or postponement thereof in favor of
the adoption of this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby (the "
_MLP Unitholder Approval_ ") is the only vote or approval of the holders of

that, if not obtained, made or given, would not, individually or in the
aggregate, reasonably be expected to result in an MLP Material Adverse Effect.

 

Section 3.5 _MLP SEC Documents; Undisclosed Liabilities_.

 

(a) MLP and its Subsidiaries have filed and furnished all reports, schedules,
forms, certifications, prospectuses, and registration, proxy and other
statements required to be filed by them with the SEC since December 31, 2011
(collectively and together with all documents filed on a voluntary basis on
Form 8-K, and in each case including all exhibits and schedules thereto and
documents incorporated by reference therein, the " _MLP SEC Documents_ ").
The MLP SEC Documents, as of their respective effective dates (in the case of
the MLP SEC Documents that are registration statements filed pursuant to the
requirements of the Securities Act) and as of their respective

 



13  SEC filing dates (in the case of all other MLP SEC Documents), or, if
amended, as finally amended prior to the date of this Agreement, complied in
all material respects with the requirements of the Exchange Act, the
Securities Act and the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, as the case may be, applicable to
such MLP SEC Documents, and none of the MLP SEC Documents as of such
respective dates contained any untrue statement of a material fact or omitted
to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order
to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they
were made, not misleading. As of the date of this Agreement, there are no
outstanding or unresolved comments received from the SEC staff with respect
to the MLP SEC Documents. To the Knowledge of MLP, none of the MLP SEC
Documents is the subject of ongoing SEC review or investigation.

 

(b) The consolidated financial statements of MLP included in the MLP SEC
Documents as of their respective dates (if amended, as of the date of the
last such amendment) comply as to form in all material respects with
applicable accounting requirements and the published rules and regulations of
the SEC with respect thereto, have been prepared in accordance with GAAP
(except, in the case of unaudited quarterly statements, as indicated in the
notes thereto) applied on a consistent basis during the periods involved
(except as may be indicated in the notes thereto) and fairly present in all
material respects the consolidated financial position of MLP and its
consolidated Subsidiaries as of the dates thereof and the consolidated results
of their operations, cash flows and changes in partners equity for the
periods then ended (subject, in the case of unaudited quarterly statements,
to normal year-end audit adjustments, none of which has been or will be,
individually or in the aggregate, material to MLP and its consolidated
Subsidiaries, taken as a whole).

 

(c) MLP has established and maintains internal control over financial
reporting and disclosure controls and procedures (as such terms are defined
in Rule 13a-15 and Rule 15d-15 under the Exchange Act); such disclosure
controls and procedures are designed to ensure that material information
relating to MLP, including its consolidated Subsidiaries, required to be
disclosed by MLP in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange
Act is accumulated and communicated to MLPs principal executive officer and
its principal financial officer to allow timely decisions regarding required
disclosure; and such disclosure controls and procedures are effective to
ensure that information required to be disclosed by MLP in the reports that it
files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and
reported within the time periods specified in SEC rules and forms. MLPs
principal executive officer and its principal financial officer have
disclosed, based on their most recent evaluation, to MLPs auditors and the
audit committee of the MLP GP Board (x) all significant deficiencies in the
design or operation of internal controls which could adversely affect MLPs
ability to record, process, summarize and report financial data and have
identified for MLPs auditors any material weaknesses in internal controls
and (y) any fraud, whether or not material, that involves management or other
employees who have a significant role in MLPs internal controls. The
principal executive officer and the principal financial officer of MLP have
made all certifications required by the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, the Exchange Act
and any related rules and regulations promulgated by the SEC with respect to
the MLP SEC Documents, and the statements contained in such certifications
were complete and correct when made. The management of MLP has completed its
assessment of the effectiveness of MLPs internal control over financial
reporting in compliance with the requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes
Oxley Act for the year ended December 31, 2012, and such assessment concluded
that such controls were effective. To the

 



14  Knowledge of MLP, as of the date of this Agreement there are no facts or
circumstances that would prevent its principal executive officer and principal
financial officer from giving the certifications and attestations required
pursuant to the rules and regulations adopted pursuant to Section 404 of the
Sarbanes Oxley Act, without qualification, when next due.

 

(d) Except (i) as reflected or otherwise reserved against on the balance sheet
of MLP and its Subsidiaries as of December 31, 2012 (the " _Balance Sheet
Date_ ") (including the notes thereto) included in the MLP SEC Documents filed
by MLP and publicly available prior to the date of this Agreement, (ii) for
liabilities and obligations incurred since the Balance Sheet Date in the
ordinary course of business and (iii) for liabilities and obligations incurred
under or in accordance with this Agreement or in connection with the
transactions contemplated hereby, neither MLP nor any of its Subsidiaries
has any liabilities or obligations of any nature (whether or not accrued or
contingent), that would be required to be reflected or reserved against on a
consolidated balance sheet of MLP prepared in accordance with GAAP or the
notes thereto, other than as have not and would not reasonably be expected to
have, individually or in the aggregate, an MLP Material Adverse Effect.

(e) Neither MLP nor any of its Subsidiaries is a party to, or has any
commitment to become a party to, any joint venture, off-balance sheet
partnership or any similar Contract (including any Contract or arrangement
relating to any transaction or relationship between or among MLP and any of
its Subsidiaries, on the one hand, and any unconsolidated Affiliate, including
any structured finance, special purpose or limited purpose entity or Person,
on the other hand, or any "off-balance sheet arrangements" (as defined in
Item 303(a) of Regulation S-K of the SEC)), where the purpose of such Contract
is to avoid disclosure of any material transaction involving, or material
liabilities of, MLP in MLPs published financial statements or any MLP SEC
Documents.

Section 3.6 _Absence of Certain Changes or Events_.

 

(a) Since the Balance Sheet Date, there has not been an MLP Material Adverse
Effect.

 

(b) Since the Balance Sheet Date, (i) except for this Agreement and the
transactions contemplated hereby, MLP and its Subsidiaries have carried on
and operated their respective businesses in all material respects in the
ordinary course of business consistent with past practice and (ii) neither MLP
nor any of its Subsidiaries has taken any action described in  _Section
5.2(a)(ii)_, _(iii)_ , _(v)_ , _(vi)_ , _(vii)_ , _(ix)_ , _(xiv)_ or _(xv)_
(but, with respect to _(vii)_ , disregarding the proviso to _Section
5.2(a)(vii)(1)_, and with respect to _(xv)_ , only to the extent applicable
to the other clauses designated in this _Section 3.6(b)(ii)_) that, if taken
after the date of this Agreement and prior to the Effective Time without the
prior written consent of Parent, would violate such provisions.

 



15 Section 3.7 _Legal Proceedings_. There are no investigations or proceedings
pending (or, to the Knowledge of MLP, threatened) by any Governmental
Authority with respect to MLP or any of its Subsidiaries or actions, suits or
proceedings pending (or, to the Knowledge of MLP, threatened) against MLP or
any of its Subsidiaries or any of their respective properties, at law or in
equity before any Governmental Authority, and there are no orders, judgments
or decrees of any Governmental Authority against MLP or any of its
Subsidiaries, in each case except for those that would not reasonably be
expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, an MLP Material Adverse
Effect.

Section 3.8 _Compliance with Laws; Permits_.

in compliance with and are not in default under or in violation of any
applicable federal, state, local or foreign or provincial law, statute,
ordinance, rule, regulation, judgment, order, injunction, decree or agency
requirement of or undertaking to any Governmental Authority, including common
law (collectively, " _Laws_ " and each, a " _Law_ "), except where such non-

necessary for MLP and its Subsidiaries to own, lease and operate
their properties and assets or to carry on their businesses as they are now
being conducted (the " _MLP Permits_ "), except where the failure to have any
of the MLP Permits would not have, individually or in the aggregate, an MLP
Material Adverse Effect. All MLP Permits are in full force and effect, except
where the failure to be in full force and effect would not have, individually
or in the aggregate, an MLP Material Adverse Effect. No suspension or
cancellation of any of the MLP Permits is pending or, to the Knowledge of
MLP, threatened, except where such suspension or cancellation would not have,
individually or in the aggregate, an MLP Material Adverse Effect. MLP and its
Subsidiaries are not, and since December 31, 2011 have not been, in violation
or breach of, or default under, any MLP Permit, except where such violation,
breach or default would not have, individually or in the aggregate, an MLP
Material Adverse Effect. As of the date of this Agreement, to the Knowledge
of MLP, no event or condition has occurred or exists which would result in a
violation of, breach, default or loss of a benefit under, or acceleration of
an obligation of MLP or any of its Subsidiaries under, any MLP Permit, or
has caused (or would cause) an applicable Governmental Authority to fail or
refuse to issue, renew or extend any MLP Permit (in each case, with or without
notice or lapse of time or both), except for violations, breaches, defaults,
losses, accelerations or failures that would not have, individually or in the
aggregate, an MLP Material Adverse Effect.

Subsidiaries, and, to the Knowledge of MLP, each joint venture partner, joint
interest owner, consultant, agent, or representative of any of the foregoing

foreign anti-corruption Laws by any such person; and (iii) to the Knowledge of
MLP, is not being (and has not been) investigated by any Governmental
Authority except, in each case of the foregoing clauses (i) through (iii), as
would not have, individually or in the aggregate, an MLP Material Adverse
Effect.

representations and warranties of Parent set forth in  _Section 4.9_, none
of the information supplied (or to be supplied) in writing by or on behalf of
MLP specifically for inclusion or incorporation by reference in (a) the
registration statement on Form S-4 to be filed with the SEC by Parent in
connection with the issuance of Parent Units in connection with the Merger (as

employee benefit plans, programs, policies, agreements or other arrangements,
whether or not subject to ERISA, including, cash or equity or equity-based,
employment, retention, change of control, health, medical, dental, disability,

or termination, in each case of clauses (i) and (ii) that are sponsored,
maintained, contributed to or required to be contributed to by MLP or any of
its Subsidiaries for the benefit of current or former employees, directors or
consultants of MLP or its Subsidiaries, or with respect to which MLP or its
Subsidiaries have any current or contingent liability, except that no
"multiemployer plan" (within the meaning of Section 4001(a)(3) of ERISA) (a "

(d) Each MLP Benefit Plan has been maintained, funded and administered in

filing for) a favorable determination or opinion letter from the United States
Internal Revenue Service that has not been revoked and, to the Knowledge of
MLP, no fact or event has occurred since the date of such
determination letter or letters from the Internal Revenue Service that would
reasonably be expected to adversely affect the qualified status of any such
MLP Benefit Plan. To the Knowledge of MLP, neither MLP, any of its
Subsidiaries, nor any of their respective ERISA Affiliates has engaged in a
transaction with respect to any MLP Benefit Plan for which they would

Plan. 

(f) Except as would not have, individually or in the aggregate, an MLP
Material Adverse Effect, with respect to any MLP Benefit Plan,

Subsidiaries required by Law or any MLP Benefit Plan have been made or
properly accrued under any such plan to any fund, trust or account established
thereunder or in connection therewith by the due date thereof.

(g) The consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby will not, either
alone or in combination with another event, (i) entitle any current or former
employee, consultant

 



19  or officer of MLP or any of its Subsidiaries to any severance pay, retention
bonuses, parachute payments, non-competition payments, unemployment
compensation or any other payment, (ii) accelerate the time of payment or
vesting, or increase the amount of any compensation due any such employee,
consultant or officer, (iii) result in any forgiveness of indebtedness or
obligation to fund benefits with respect to any such employee, director or
officer or (iv) result in any amount failing to be deductible by reason of
Section 280G of the Code. No director, officer, employee or other service
provider of MLP or any of its Subsidiaries is entitled to a gross up, make
whole or other similar payment as a result of the imposition of Taxes under
Section 280G, Section 4999 or Section 409A of the Code pursuant to any
agreement or arrangement with MLP or any of its Subsidiaries. Each
MLP Benefit Plan may be amended or terminated at any time without penalty.

employment, occupational health and safety or workplace safety and
insurance/workers compensation laws to conduct an investigation of MLP or any
of its Subsidiaries with respect to such matters and, to the Knowledge of MLP,

29 Section 4.5 _Parent SEC Documents; Undisclosed Liabilities_.

 

(a) Parent and its Subsidiaries have filed and furnished all reports,
schedules, forms, certifications, prospectuses, and registration, proxy and
other statements required to be filed by them with the SEC since December 31,
2011 (collectively and together with all documents filed on a voluntary basis
on Form 8-K, and in each case including all exhibits and schedules thereto
and documents incorporated by reference therein, the " _Parent SEC Documents_
"). The Parent SEC Documents, as of their respective effective dates (in the
case of the Parent SEC Documents that are registration statements filed
pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Act) and as of their
respective SEC filing dates (in the case of all other Parent SEC Documents),
or, if amended, as finally amended prior to the date of this Agreement,
complied in all material respects with the requirements of the Exchange Act,
the Securities Act and the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, as the case may be, applicable
to such Parent SEC Documents, and none of the Parent SEC Documents as of such
respective dates contained any untrue statement of a material fact or omitted
to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order
to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they
were made, not misleading. As of the date of this Agreement, there are no
outstanding or unresolved comments received from the SEC staff with respect to
the Parent SEC Documents. To the Knowledge of Parent, none of the Parent SEC
Documents is the subject of ongoing SEC review or investigation.

 

(b) The consolidated financial statements of Parent included in the Parent SEC
Documents as of their respective dates (if amended, as of the date of the
last such amendment) comply as to form in all material respects with
applicable accounting requirements and the published rules and regulations of
the SEC with respect thereto, have been prepared in accordance with GAAP
(except, in the case of unaudited quarterly statements, as indicated in the
notes thereto) applied on a consistent basis during the periods involved
(except as may be indicated in the notes thereto) and fairly present in all
material respects the consolidated financial position of Parent and its
consolidated Subsidiaries as of the dates thereof and the consolidated results
of their operations, cash flows and changes in partners equity for the
periods then ended (subject, in the case of unaudited quarterly statements,
to normal year-end audit adjustments, none of which has been or will be,
individually or in the aggregate, material to Parent and its consolidated
Subsidiaries, taken as a whole).

 

(c) Parent has established and maintains internal control over financial
reporting and disclosure controls and procedures (as such terms are defined
in Rule 13a-15 and Rule 15d-15 under the Exchange Act); such disclosure
controls and procedures are designed to ensure that material information
relating to Parent, including its consolidated Subsidiaries, required to be
disclosed by Parent in the reports that it files or submits under the
Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to Parents principal executive
officer and its principal financial officer to allow timely decisions
regarding required disclosure; and such disclosure controls and procedures
are effective to ensure that information required to be disclosed by Parent in
the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded,
processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in SEC
rules and forms. Parents principal executive officer and its principal
financial officer have disclosed, based on their most recent evaluation, to
Parents auditors and the audit and risk committee of the Parent Managing GP
Board (x) all significant deficiencies in the design or operation of internal
controls which could adversely affect Parents ability to record, process,
summarize and report financial data and have identified for Parents
auditors any material weaknesses in internal controls and (y) any fraud,
whether or

 



30  not material, that involves management or other employees who have a
significant role in Parents internal controls. The principal executive
officer and the principal financial officer of Parent have made all
certifications required by the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, the Exchange Act and any
related rules and regulations promulgated by the SEC with respect to the
Parent SEC Documents, and the statements contained in such certifications
were complete and correct when made. The management of Parent has completed
its assessment of the effectiveness of Parents internal control over
financial reporting in compliance with the requirements of Section 404 of the
Sarbanes Oxley Act for the year ended December 31, 2012, and such assessment
concluded that such controls were effective. To the Knowledge of Parent, as of
the date of this Agreement, there are no facts or circumstances that would
prevent its principal executive officer and principal financial officer from
giving the certifications and attestations required pursuant to the rules and
regulations adopted pursuant to Section 404 of the Sarbanes Oxley Act, without
qualification, when next due.

 

(d) Except (i) as reflected or otherwise reserved against on the balance sheet
of Parent and its Subsidiaries as of the Balance Sheet Date (including the
notes thereto) included in the Parent SEC Documents filed by Parent and
publicly available prior to the date of this Agreement, (ii) for liabilities
and obligations incurred since the Balance Sheet Date in the ordinary course
of business and (iii) for liabilities and obligations incurred under or in
accordance with this Agreement or in connection with the transactions
contemplated hereby, neither Parent nor any of its Subsidiaries has any
liabilities or obligations of any nature (whether or not accrued or
contingent), that would be required to be reflected or reserved against on a
consolidated balance sheet of Parent prepared in accordance with GAAP or the
notes thereto, other than as have not and would not reasonably be expected to
have, individually or in the aggregate, a Parent Material Adverse Effect.

(e) Neither Parent nor any of its Subsidiaries is a party to, or has any
commitment to become a party to, any joint venture, off-balance sheet
partnership or any similar Contract (including any Contract or arrangement
relating to any transaction or relationship between or among Parent and any
of its Subsidiaries, on the one hand, and any unconsolidated Affiliate,
including any structured finance, special purpose or limited purpose entity or
Person, on the other hand, or any "off-balance sheet arrangements" (as
defined in Item 303(a) of Regulation S-K of the SEC)), where the purpose of
such Contract is to avoid disclosure of any material transaction involving, or
material liabilities of, Parent in Parents published financial statements
or any Parent SEC Documents.

Section 4.6 _Absence of Certain Changes or Events_.

 

(a) Since the Balance Sheet Date, there has not been a Parent Material Adverse
Effect.

 

(b) Since the Balance Sheet Date, (i) except for this Agreement and the
transactions contemplated hereby, Parent and its Subsidiaries have carried on
and operated their respective businesses in all material respects in the
ordinary course of business consistent with past practice and (ii) neither
Parent nor any of its Subsidiaries has taken any action described in 
_Section 5.2(b)_ that, if taken after the date of this Agreement and prior to
the Effective Time without the prior written consent of Parent, would violate
such provisions.

 



31 Section 4.7 _Legal Proceedings_. There are no investigations or proceedings
pending (or, to the Knowledge of Parent, threatened) by any Governmental
Authority with respect to Parent or any of its Subsidiaries or actions, suits
or proceedings pending (or, to the Knowledge of Parent, threatened) against
Parent or any of its Subsidiaries or any of their respective properties, at
law or in equity before any Governmental Authority, and there are no orders,
judgments or decrees of any Governmental Authority against Parent or any of
its Subsidiaries, in each case except for those that would not reasonably be
expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Parent Material Adverse
Effect.

Section 4.8  _Compliance with Laws; Permits_.

(a) Parent and its Subsidiaries are, and since the later of December 31, 2011
and their respective dates of incorporation, formation or organization have
been, in compliance with and are not in default under or in violation of any
applicable Laws, except where such non-compliance, default or violation would
not have, individually or in the aggregate, a Parent Material Adverse Effect.

(b) Parent and its Subsidiaries are in possession of all franchises, tariffs,
grants, authorizations, licenses, permits, easements, variances, exceptions,
consents, certificates, approvals and orders of any Governmental Authority
necessary for Parent and its Subsidiaries to own, lease and operate their
properties and assets or to carry on their businesses as they are now being
conducted (the " _Parent Permits_ "), except where the failure to have any of
the Parent Permits would not have, individually or in the aggregate, a Parent
Material Adverse Effect. All Parent Permits are in full force and effect,
except where the failure to be in full force and effect would not have,
individually or in the aggregate, a Parent Material Adverse Effect. No
suspension or cancellation of any of Parent Permits is pending or, to the
Knowledge of Parent, threatened, except where such suspension or cancellation
would not have, individually or in the aggregate, a Parent Material Adverse
Effect. Parent and its Subsidiaries are not, and since December 31, 2011 have
not been, in violation or breach of, or default under, any Parent Permit,
except where such violation, breach or default would not have, individually or
in the aggregate, a Parent Material Adverse Effect. As of the date of this
Agreement, to the Knowledge of Parent, no event or condition has occurred or
exists which would result in a violation of, breach, default or loss of a
benefit under, or acceleration of an obligation of Parent or any of its
Subsidiaries under, any Parent Permit, or has caused (or would cause) an
applicable Governmental Authority to fail or refuse to issue, renew or extend
any Parent Permit (in each case, with or without notice or lapse of time or
both), except for violations, breaches, defaults, losses, accelerations or
failures that would not have, individually or in the aggregate, a Parent
Material Adverse Effect.

 



32 (c) Without limiting the generality of _Section 4.8(a)_, Parent, each of
its Subsidiaries, and, to the Knowledge of Parent, each joint venture
partner, joint interest owner, consultant, agent, or representative of any of

the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, and any other U.S. and foreign anti-
corruption Laws that are applicable to Parent or its Subsidiaries; (ii) has

investigated by any Governmental Authority except, in each case of the
foregoing clauses (i) through (iii), as has not had, and would not reasonably
be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Parent Material
Adverse Effect.

 

Section 4.9 _Information Supplied_. Subject to the accuracy of the
representations and warranties of MLP set forth in  _Section 3.9_, none of
the information supplied (or to be supplied) in writing by or on behalf of
Parent specifically for inclusion or incorporation by reference in (a) the

of the circumstances under which they are made, not misleading, and (b) the
Proxy Statement will, on the date it is first mailed to Unitholders of MLP,

include any misstatement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact
necessary to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under
which they were made, not misleading, the party that discovers such
information shall promptly notify the other parties hereto and an appropriate
amendment or supplement describing such information shall be promptly filed
with the SEC and, to the extent required by Law, disseminated to

shall use its reasonable best efforts to solicit from the Unitholders proxies
in favor of the Merger and to take all other action necessary or advisable to
secure the MLP Unitholder Approval. The Proxy Statement shall include a copy
of the MLP Fairness Opinion and (subject to  _Section 5.3_) the MLP Board

proxies for the purpose of obtaining the MLP Unitholder Approval, (ii) for
the absence of quorum, (iii) to allow reasonable additional time for the

efforts to promptly cure such violation once MLP is made aware of such
violation.

 

(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in _Section 5.3(a)_,
if at any time following the date of this Agreement and prior to obtaining
the MLP Unitholder Approval, (i) MLP has received a written Alternative
Proposal that the MLP GP Board believes is bona fide, (ii) the MLP GP Board,
after consultation with its financial advisors and outside legal counsel,
determines in good faith that such Alternative Proposal constitutes or could
reasonably be expected to lead to or result in a Superior Proposal and (iii)
such Alternative Proposal did not result from a material breach of this 
_Section 5.3_, then MLP may, subject to clauses (x) and (y) below, (A)
furnish information, including confidential information, with respect to MLP
and its Subsidiaries to the Person making such Alternative Proposal and (B)
participate in discussions or negotiations regarding such Alternative
Proposal; _provided_ that (x) MLP will not, and will use reasonable best
efforts to cause its Representatives not to, disclose any non-public
information to such Person unless MLP has, or first enters into, a
confidentiality agreement with such Person with confidentiality provisions and
"standstill" provisions that are not less restrictive to such Person than the
provisions of the Parent Confidentiality Agreement are to Parent ( _provided_
that the standstill provisions of such confidentiality agreement may permit
such Person to make a non-public Alternative Proposal to MLP GP Board) and (y)
MLP will provide to Parent non-public information about MLP or its
Subsidiaries that was not previously provided or made available to Parent
prior to or substantially concurrently with providing or making available such
non-public information to such other Person. If MLP desires to waive any of
the standstill provisions of any confidentiality agreement entered into with
another Person pursuant to the immediately preceding sentence, MLP shall give
written notice of the specific aspect of the standstill provisions desired to
be waived and thereafter shall be permitted to waive such provisions, which
waiver shall constitute a waiver of the standstill provisions in Section 9 of
the Parent Confidentiality Agreement in the same manner and to the same
extent as such provisions are waived with respect to such Person.

 



44 (c) In addition to the other obligations of MLP set forth in this _Section
5.3_, MLP shall promptly advise Parent, orally and in writing, and in no
event later than 24 hours after receipt, if any proposal, offer, inquiry or
other contact is received by, any information is requested from, or any
discussions or negotiations are sought to be initiated or continued with, MLP
in respect of any Alternative Proposal, and shall, in any such notice to
Parent, indicate the identity of the Person making such proposal, offer,
inquiry or other contact and the terms and conditions of any proposals or
offers or the nature of any inquiries or contacts (and shall include with such
notice copies of any written materials received from or on behalf of such
Person relating to such proposal, offer, inquiry or request), and thereafter
shall promptly keep Parent reasonably informed of all material developments
affecting the status and terms of any such proposals, offers, inquiries or
requests (and MLP shall promptly provide Parent with copies of any additional
written materials received by MLP or that MLP has delivered to any third
party making an Alternative Proposal that relate to such proposals, offers,
inquiries or requests) and of the status of any such discussions or
negotiations.

 

(d) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, at any time prior
to obtaining the MLP Unitholder Approval, the MLP GP Board may effect an
Adverse Recommendation Change in response to an Alternative Proposal or a
Changed Circumstance if the MLP GP Board, after consultation with its outside
legal counsel and financial advisors, determines in good faith that the
failure to take such action would be inconsistent with its duties under the
MLP Partnership Agreement or applicable Law and:

(i) if the MLP GP Board intends to effect such Adverse Recommendation Change
in response to an Alternative Proposal:

(A) such Alternative Proposal is bona fide, in writing and has not been
withdrawn or abandoned;

(B) the MLP GP Board has determined, after consultation with its outside
legal counsel and financial advisors, that such Alternative Proposal
constitutes a Superior Proposal after giving effect to all of the adjustments
offered by Parent pursuant to clause (E) below; 

(C) MLP has provided prior written notice to Parent in accordance with
_Section 8.9_ (the " _Superior Proposal Notice_ ") of the MLP GP Boards
intention to effect an Adverse Recommendation Change, and such Superior
Proposal Notice has specified the identity of the Person making such
Alternative Proposal, the material terms and conditions of such Alternative
Proposal, and complete copies of any written proposal or offers (including
proposed agreements) received by MLP in connection with such Alternative
Proposal;

 

(D) during the period that commences on the date of delivery of the Superior
Proposal Notice as determined in accordance with  _Section 8.9_ and ends at
11:59 p.m. Central time on the date that is the fifth calendar day following
the date of such delivery (the " _Superior Proposal Notice Period_ "), MLP
shall (1) negotiate with Parent in good faith to

 



45  make such adjustments to the terms and conditions of this Agreement as would
permit the MLP GP Board not to effect an Adverse Recommendation Change; and
(2) keep Parent reasonably informed with respect to the status and changes in
the material terms and conditions of such Alternative Proposal or other change
in circumstances related thereto; _provided_ , _however_ , any material
revisions to such Alternative Proposal (it being agreed that any change in
the purchase price in such Alternative Proposal shall be deemed a material
revision) shall require delivery of a subsequent Superior Proposal Notice and
a subsequent Superior Proposal Notice Period in respect of such revised
Alternative Proposal, except that such subsequent Superior Proposal Notice
Period shall expire upon the later of (x) the end of the initial Superior
Proposal Notice Period and (y) 11:59 p.m. Central time on the date that is
the third calendar day following the date of the delivery of such subsequent
Superior Proposal Notice; and

(E) the MLP GP Board shall have considered all revisions to the terms of this
Agreement irrevocably offered in writing by Parent and, at the end of the
Superior Proposal Notice Period, shall have determined in good faith that such
Alternative Proposal continues to constitute a Superior Proposal even if such
revisions were to be given effect; or

(ii) if the MLP GP Board intends to effect such Adverse Recommendation Change
in response to a Changed Circumstance:

(A) MLP has provided prior written notice to Parent in accordance with
_Section 8.9_ (the " _Recommendation Change Notice_ ") of the MLP GP Boards
intention to effect an Adverse Recommendation Change, and such Recommendation
Change Notice has specified the details of such Changed Circumstance and the
reasons for the Adverse Recommendation Change;

(B) during the period that commences on the date of delivery of the
Recommendation Change Notice as determined in accordance with _Section 8.9_
and ends at 11:59 p.m. Central time the date that is the fifth calendar day
following the date of such delivery (the " _Recommendation Change Notice
Period_ "), MLP shall (i) negotiate with Parent in good faith to make such
adjustments to the terms and conditions of this Agreement as would permit the
MLP GP Board not to effect an Adverse Recommendation Change; and (ii) keep
Parent reasonably informed of any change in circumstances related thereto; and

 

(C) the MLP GP Board shall have considered all revisions to the terms of this
Agreement irrevocably offered in writing by Parent and, at the end of the
Adverse Recommendation Change Notice Period, shall have determined in good
faith that the failure to effect an Adverse Recommendation Change would be
inconsistent with its duties under the MLP Partnership Agreement
or applicable Law even if such revisions were to be given effect.

(e) Nothing contained in this Agreement shall prevent MLP or the MLP GP Board
from issuing a "stop, look and listen" communication pursuant to Rule 14d-9(f)
under the

 



46  Exchange Act or complying with Rule 14d-9 and Rule 14e-2 under the Exchange
Act with respect to an Alternative Proposal if the MLP GP Board determines in
good faith (after consultation with outside legal counsel) that its failure
to do so would be reasonably likely to constitute a violation of applicable
Law; _provided_ that any Adverse Recommendation Change may only be made in
accordance with _Section 5.3(d)_. For the avoidance of doubt, a public
statement that describes MLPs receipt of an Alternative Proposal and the
operation of this Agreement with respect thereto shall not be deemed an
Adverse Recommendation Change.

 

Section 5.4 _Reasonable Best Efforts_.

 

(a) Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement (including _Section
5.4(d)_), each of the Parent Entities, on the one hand, and the MLP Entities,
on the other hand, shall cooperate with the other and use (and shall cause
their respective Subsidiaries to use) its reasonable best efforts to (i) take,
or cause to be taken, all actions, and do, or cause to be done, all things,
necessary, proper or advisable to cause the conditions to the Closing to be
satisfied as promptly as practicable (and in any event no later than the
Outside Date) and to consummate and make effective, in the most expeditious
manner practicable, the transactions contemplated hereby, including preparing
and filing promptly and fully all documentation to effect all necessary

submissions of information, applications and other documents (including any
required or recommended filings under applicable Antitrust Laws, (ii) obtain
promptly (and in any event no later than the Outside Date) all approvals,

Governmental Authority or third party necessary, proper or advisable to
consummate the transactions contemplated hereby, (iii) defend any lawsuits or
other legal proceedings, whether judicial or administrative, challenging this
Agreement or the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby and (iv)
obtain all necessary consents, approvals or waivers from third parties. 

(b) In furtherance and not in limitation of the foregoing, (i) each party
hereto (including by their respective Subsidiaries) agrees to make an
appropriate filing of a Notification and Report Form pursuant to the HSR Act
with respect to the transactions contemplated hereby as promptly as
practicable and in any event within 15 business days after the date of this
Agreement (unless a later date is mutually agreed to by the parties hereto)
and to supply as promptly as practicable any additional information and
documentary material that may be requested by any Governmental Authority
pursuant to the HSR Act or any other Antitrust Law and use its reasonable
best efforts to take, or cause to be taken (including by their respective
Subsidiaries), all other actions consistent with this _Section 5.4_ necessary
to cause the expiration or termination of the applicable waiting periods
under the HSR Act as soon as practicable (and in any event no later than the
Outside Date); and (ii) MLP and Parent shall each use its reasonable best
efforts to (x) take all action necessary to ensure that no state takeover
statute or similar Law is or becomes applicable to any of the transactions
contemplated hereby and (y) if any state takeover statute or similar Law
becomes applicable to any of the transactions contemplated hereby, take all
action necessary to ensure that such transaction may be consummated as
promptly as practicable on the terms contemplated by this Agreement and
otherwise minimize the effect of such Law on the transaction.

 



47 (c) Each of the parties hereto shall use (and shall cause their respective
Subsidiaries to use) its reasonable best efforts to (i) cooperate in all
respects with each other in connection with any filing or submission with a
Governmental Authority in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby
and in connection with any investigation or other inquiry by or before a
Governmental Authority relating to the transactions contemplated hereby,
including any proceeding initiated by a private Person, (ii) promptly inform
the other party of (and supply to the other party) any communication received
by such party from, or given by such party to, the Federal Trade Commission,

Authority and any material communication received or given in connection with
any proceeding by a private Person, in each case regarding any of the
transactions contemplated hereby, (iii) permit the other party to review in
advance and incorporate the other partys reasonable comments in
any communication to be given by it to any Governmental Authority with
respect to obtaining any clearances required under any Antitrust Law in
connection with the transactions contemplated hereby and (iv) consult with the
other party in advance of any meeting or teleconference with any Governmental
Authority or, in connection with any proceeding by a private Person, with any
other Person, and, to the extent not prohibited by the Governmental Authority
or other Person, give the other party the opportunity to attend and
participate in such meetings and teleconferences. Parent shall have the
principal responsibility for devising and implementing the strategy for
obtaining any clearances required under any Antitrust Law in connection
with the transactions contemplated hereby and shall take the lead in all
meetings and communications with any Governmental Authority in connection with
obtaining such clearances, _provided_ , _however_ , that Parent shall consult
in advance with MLP and in good faith take MLPs views into account regarding
the overall strategy. Subject to _Section 5.6(b)_, the parties shall take
reasonable efforts to share information protected from disclosure under the
attorney-client privilege, work product doctrine, joint defense privilege or
any other privilege pursuant to this _Section 5.4_ in a manner so as to
preserve the applicable privilege.

 

(d) Parent and MLP (including by causing their respective Subsidiaries) agree
to use their reasonable best efforts to (x) resolve any objections that a
Governmental Authority or other Person may assert under any Antitrust Law with
respect to the transactions contemplated hereby, and (y) avoid or eliminate
each and every impediment under any Antitrust Law that may be asserted by any
Governmental Authority with respect to the transactions contemplated hereby,
in each case, so as to enable the Closing to occur as promptly as practicable
and in any event no later than the Outside Date, and including taking or
agreeing to take the types of actions, but subject to the limitations,
described in the following sentence. Notwithstanding the foregoing or any
other provision of this Agreement, MLP shall not, without Parents prior
written consent, commit to any divestiture transaction or agree to any
restriction on its business, and nothing in this _Section 5.4_ shall (i) limit
any applicable rights a party may have to terminate this Agreement pursuant to
_Section 7.1_ in a case where  _Section 7.1_ permits such termination or (ii)
require Parent to offer, accept or agree to (A) dispose or hold separate any
part of MLPs, Parents or their respective Subsidiaries businesses,
operations or assets (or a combination thereof), (B) not compete in any
geographic area or line of business, and/or (C) restrict the manner in which,
or whether, Parent, MLP or any of their Subsidiaries may carry on business in
any part of the world;  _provided_ , _however_ , that Parent shall be
required to offer, accept or agree to the actions in clauses (A), (B) and/or
(C) if (and only if) the following conditions are satisfied: (1) any such
dispositions or holdings separate of, and/or limitations or restrictions on,
are, individually and in the aggregate, immaterial to the businesses,
operations and/or assets of MLP, Parent or their

 



48  respective Subsidiaries ( _provided_ that, in the case of Parent and its
Subsidiaries, for purposes of determining whether a business, operation or
asset is immaterial, it shall be assumed that Parent and its Subsidiaries are
of equivalent size to the current size of MLP and its Subsidiaries, in each
case taken as a whole) and (2) the effect of any such dispositions, holdings
separate, limitations and/or restrictions would not, individually or in the
aggregate, reasonably be expected to result in a loss (other than an
immaterial loss) of the reasonably expected benefits to Parent of the
transactions contemplated hereby.

 

Section 5.5 _Public Announcements_. The initial press release with respect to
the execution of this Agreement shall be a joint press release to be
reasonably agreed upon by Parent and MLP. Thereafter, neither MLP nor Parent
shall issue or cause the publication of any press release or other public
announcement (to the extent previously issued or made in accordance with
this Agreement) with respect to this Agreement or the transactions
contemplated hereby without the prior consent of the other party (which
consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed), except as may be
required by Law or by any applicable listing agreement with the NYSE or other
national securities exchange as determined in the good faith judgment of the
party proposing to make such release (in which case such party shall not issue
or cause the publication of such press release or other public announcement
without prior consultation with the other party); _provided_ , _however_ ,
that MLP shall not be required by this _Section 5.5_ to consult with any
other party with respect to a public announcement in connection with the
receipt and existence of an Alternative Proposal that the MLP GP Board
believes is _bona fide_ and matters related thereto or an Adverse
Recommendation Change but nothing in this proviso shall limit any obligation
of MLP under _Section 5.3(d)_ to negotiate with Parent in good faith;
_provided_ , _further_ , that each party and their respective controlled
affiliates may make statements that are consistent with statements made in
previous press releases, public disclosures or public statements made by
Parent or MLP in compliance with this _Section 5.5_.

Section 5.6  _Access to Information; Confidentiality_.

(a) Upon reasonable notice and subject to applicable Laws relating to the
exchange of information, each party shall, and shall cause each of its
Subsidiaries to afford to the other party and its Representatives reasonable
access during normal business hours (and, with respect to books and records,
the right to copy) to all of its and its Subsidiaries properties,
commitments, books, Contracts, records and correspondence (in each case,
whether in physical or electronic form), officers, employees, accountants,
counsel, financial advisors and other Representatives. Each party shall
furnish promptly to the other party (i) a copy of each report, schedule and
other document filed or submitted by it pursuant to the requirements of
federal or state securities Laws and a copy of any communication (including
"comment letters") received by such party from the SEC concerning compliance
with securities Laws and (ii) all other information concerning its and its
Subsidiaries business, properties and personnel as the other party may
reasonably request (including information necessary to prepare the Proxy
Statement). Except for disclosures permitted by the terms of the
Confidentiality Agreement, dated as of August 28, 2013, between Parent and MLP
(as it may be amended from time to time, the " _Parent_

 



49   _Confidentiality Agreement_ "), each party and its Representatives shall
hold information received from the other party pursuant to this _Section 5.6_
in confidence in accordance with the terms of the Parent Confidentiality
Agreement.

(b) This _Section 5.6_ shall not require either party to permit any access,
or to disclose any information, that in the reasonable, good faith judgment
(after consultation with counsel, which may be in-house counsel) of such party
would reasonably be expected to result in (i) any violation of any contract
or Law to which such party or its Subsidiaries is a party or is subject or
cause any privilege (including attorney-client privilege) that such party or
any of its Subsidiaries would be entitled to assert to be undermined with
respect to such information and such undermining of such privilege could in
such partys good faith judgment (after consultation with counsel, which may
be in-house counsel) adversely affect in any material respect such partys
position in any pending or, what such party believes in good faith (after
consultation with counsel, which may be in-house counsel) could be, future
litigation or (ii) if such party or any of its Subsidiaries, on the one hand,
and the other party or any of its Subsidiaries, on the other hand, are
adverse parties in a litigation, such information being reasonably pertinent
thereto; _provided_ that, in the case of clause (i), the parties hereto shall
cooperate in seeking to find a way to allow disclosure of such information
(including by entering into a joint-defense or similar agreement) to the
extent doing so (1) would not (in the good faith belief of the party being
requested to disclose the information (after consultation with counsel, which
may be in-house counsel)) reasonably be likely to result in the violation of
any such contract or Law or reasonably be likely to cause such privilege to be
undermined with respect to such information or (2) could reasonably (in the
good faith belief of the party being requested to disclose the information
(after consultation with counsel, which may be in-house counsel)) be managed
through the use of customary "clean-room" arrangements pursuant to
which appropriately designated Representatives of the other party shall be
provided access to such information; _provided_ , _further_ , that the party
being requested to disclose the information shall (x) notify the other party
that such disclosures are reasonably likely to violate its or its
Subsidiaries obligations under any such contract or Law or are reasonably
likely to cause such privilege to be undermined, (y) communicate to the other
party in reasonable detail the facts giving rise to such notification and the
subject matter of such information (to the extent it is able to do so in
accordance with the first proviso in this _Section 5.6(b)_) and (z) in the
case where such disclosures are reasonably likely to violate its or its
Subsidiaries obligations under any contract, use reasonable commercial
efforts to seek consent from the applicable third party to any such contract
with respect to the disclosures prohibited thereby (to the extent not
otherwise expressly prohibited by the terms of such contract).

(c) No investigation, or information received, pursuant to this _Section
5.6_ will modify any of the representations and warranties of the parties
hereto.

Section 5.7  _Notification of Certain Matters_. MLP shall give prompt notice
to Parent, and Parent shall give prompt notice to MLP, of (i) any notice or
other communication received by such party from any Governmental Authority in
connection with the transactions contemplated hereby or from any Person
alleging that the consent of such Person is or may be required in connection
with the transactions contemplated hereby, if the subject matter of such
communication or the failure of such party to obtain such

 



50  consent is reasonably likely to be material to MLP or Parent, (ii) any
actions, suits, claims, investigations or proceedings commenced or, to such
partys knowledge, threatened against, relating to or involving or otherwise
affecting such party or any of its Subsidiaries and that relate to the
transactions contemplated hereby, (iii) the discovery of any fact or
circumstance that, or the occurrence or non-occurrence of any event the
occurrence or non-occurrence of which, would result in the failure to be
satisfied of any of the conditions to the Closing in _Article VI_ and (iv) any
material failure of such party to comply with or satisfy any covenant
or agreement to be complied with or satisfied by it hereby which would result
in the failure to be satisfied of any of the conditions to the Closing in
_Article VI_ ; _provided_ that, in the case of clauses (iii) and (iv), the
failure to comply with this _Section 5.7_ shall not result in the failure to
be satisfied of any of the conditions to the Closing in _Article VI_ , or give
rise to any right to terminate this Agreement under _Article VII_, if
the underlying fact, circumstance, event or failure would not in and of
itself give rise to such failure or right.

Section 5.8  _Indemnification and Insurance_.

(a) For purposes of this _Section 5.8_, (i) " _Indemnified Person_ " shall
mean any person who is now, or has been or becomes at any time prior to the
Effective Time, an officer or director of MLP or any of its Subsidiaries and
also with respect to any such Person, in their capacity as a director,
officer, employee, member, trustee or fiduciary of another corporation,
foundation, partnership, joint venture, trust, pension or other employee
benefit plan or enterprise (whether or not such other entity or enterprise is
affiliated with MLP) serving at the request of or on behalf of MLP or any of
its Subsidiaries and together with such Persons heirs, executors or
administrators and (ii) " _Proceeding_ " shall mean any actual or threatened
claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation, whether civil, criminal,
administrative, investigative or otherwise and whether or not such claim,
action, suit, proceeding or investigation results in a formal civil or
criminal litigation or regulatory action.

 

(b) From and after the Effective Time, solely to the extent that MLP or any
applicable Subsidiary would be permitted to indemnify an Indemnified Person,
Parent and the Surviving Entity jointly and severally agree to (i) indemnify
and hold harmless against any cost or expenses (including attorneys fees),
judgments, fines, losses, claims, damages or liabilities and amounts paid in
settlement in connection with any Proceeding, and provide advancement of
expenses to, all Indemnified Persons to the fullest extent permitted under
applicable Law and (ii) honor the provisions regarding elimination of
liability of directors, indemnification of officers, directors and employees
and advancement of expenses contained in the MLP Charter Documents and
comparable governing instruments of any Subsidiary of MLP immediately prior to
the Effective Time and ensure that the organizational documents of the
Surviving Entity shall, for a period of six years following the Effective
Time, contain provisions no less favorable with respect to indemnification,
advancement of expenses and exculpation of present and former directors,
officers and agents of MLP and its Subsidiaries than are presently set forth
in the MLP Charter Documents. Any right of indemnification of an Indemnified
Person pursuant to this _Section 5.8(b)_ shall not be amended, repealed or
otherwise modified at any time in a manner that would adversely affect the
rights of such Indemnified Person as provided herein.

 



51 (c) Parent shall cause the Surviving Entity to, and the Surviving Entity
shall, maintain in effect for six years from the Effective Time MLPs current
directors and officers liability insurance policies covering acts or
omissions occurring at or prior to the Effective Time with respect to
Indemnified Persons ( _provided_ that the Surviving Entity may substitute
therefor policies with reputable carriers of at least the same coverage
containing terms and conditions that are no less favorable to the Indemnified
Persons); _provided_ ,  _however_ , that in no event shall the Surviving
Entity be required to expend pursuant to this _Section 5.8(c)_ more than an
amount per year equal to 300% of current annual premiums paid by MLP for such
insurance (the " _Maximum Amount_ "). In the event that, but for the proviso
to the immediately preceding sentence, the Surviving Entity would be required
to expend more than the Maximum Amount, the Surviving Entity shall obtain the
maximum amount of such insurance as is available for the Maximum Amount. If
MLP in its sole discretion elects, then, in lieu of the obligations of Parent
under this _Section 5.8(c)_, MLP may, prior to the Effective Time, purchase a
"tail policy" with respect to acts or omissions occurring or alleged to have
occurred prior to the Effective Time that were committed or alleged to have
been committed by such Indemnified Persons in their capacity as such;
_provided_ that in no event shall the cost of such policy exceed six times
the Maximum Amount.

(d) The rights of any Indemnified Person under this _Section 5.8_ shall be
in addition to any other rights such Indemnified Person may have under the
organizational documents of MLP, the Surviving Entity, the DRULPA or the
DLLCA. The provisions of this _Section 5.8_ shall survive the consummation of
the transactions contemplated hereby for a period of six years and are
expressly intended to benefit each of the Indemnified Persons and their
respective heirs and representatives; _provided_ , _however_ , that in the
event that any claim or claims for indemnification set forth in this _Section
5.8_ are asserted or made within such six-year period, all rights to
indemnification in respect of any such claim or claims shall continue until
disposition of all such claims. If Parent and/or the Surviving Entity, or any
of their respective successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into
any other Person, or (ii) transfers or conveys all or substantially all of
their businesses or assets to any other Person, then, in each such case, to
the extent necessary, a proper provision shall be made so that the successors
and assigns of Parent and/or the Surviving Entity, as the case may be, shall
assume the obligations of Parent and the Surviving Entity set forth in this 
_Section 5.8_.

Section 5.9 _Securityholder Litigation_. MLP shall give Parent the opportunity
to participate in the defense or settlement of any securityholder litigation
against MLP and/or its officers and directors relating to the transactions
contemplated hereby, provided that MLP shall in any event control such defense
and/or settlement (subject to  _Section 5.2(a)(xiii)_) and shall not be
required to provide information if doing so would be reasonably expected to
threaten the loss of any attorney-client privilege or other applicable legal
privilege.

 



52 Section 5.10 _Financing Matters_.

 

(a) MLP shall, at the request of Parent, (i) call for prepayment or
redemption, or prepay or redeem, (ii) attempt to renegotiate the terms of,
(iii) commence an offer to purchase and/or consent solicitation or (iv)
satisfy and discharge or defease any then-existing indebtedness for borrowed
money of MLP; _provided_ , _however_ , that MLP shall not be obligated to
make or cause to become effective any such action (nor shall MLP be required
to incur any cost or liability in respect thereof) prior to the Effective
Time. Parent shall prepare all necessary and appropriate documentation in
connection with any action described above, and provide MLP with a reasonable
opportunity to comment on such documents. Parent and MLP shall, and shall
cause their respective Subsidiaries and Representatives to, reasonably
cooperate with each other in the preparation of such documents.

(b) To the extent requested by Parent, MLP shall cooperate with Parent with
respect to, and use its reasonable best efforts to facilitate, possible
alternative or supplemental structures for the acquisition of MLP and its
Subsidiaries; _provided_ that such structures do not impede or delay the
Closing of the transactions contemplated hereby or change the Merger
Consideration or adversely affect MLP and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole,
should the Merger not occur.

Section 5.11  _Fees and Expenses_. All fees and expenses incurred in
connection with the transactions contemplated hereby including all legal,
accounting, financial advisory, consulting and all other fees and expenses of
third parties incurred by a party in connection with the negotiation and
effectuation of the terms and conditions of this Agreement and the
transactions contemplated hereby, shall be the obligation of the respective
party incurring such fees and expenses, except Parent and MLP shall each bear
and pay one-half of the expenses incurred in connection with the filing,
printing and mailing of the Registration Statement and Proxy Statement.

 

Section 5.12 _Section 16 Matters_. Prior to the Effective Time, Parent and
MLP shall take all such steps as may be required (to the extent permitted
under Applicable Law) to cause any dispositions of Common Units (including
derivative securities with respect to Common Units) or acquisitions of Parent
Units (including derivative securities with respect to Parent
Units) resulting from the transactions contemplated by this Agreement by each
individual who is subject to the reporting requirements of Section 16(a) of
the Exchange Act with respect to MLP, or will become subject to such reporting
requirements with respect to Parent, to be exempt under Rule 16b-3
promulgated under the Exchange Act.

Section 5.13 _Employee Benefits_.

 

(a) As of the Effective Time, Parent shall assume all MLP Benefit Plans in
accordance with their terms as in effect immediately before the Effective
Time; _provided_ that, nothing herein shall limit the right of MLP or Parent
or any of their respective Affiliates to amend or terminate such MLP Benefit
Plans to the extent permitted by their terms. For a period of one year
following the Effective Time (the " _Continuation Period_ "),

 



53  Parent shall provide, or shall cause to be provided, to each employee of MLP
or any of its Subsidiaries as of immediately prior to the Effective Time (the
" _MLP Employees_ "), for so long as such MLP Employee remains an employee of
Parent, the Surviving Entity or any of their respective Affiliates during the
Continuation Period, (i) base salary or regularly hourly wage which is the
same as or no less favorable than that provided to such MLP Employee
immediately before the Effective Time and (ii) eligibility to participate in
the employee benefit plans (including cash incentive compensation plans)
sponsored or maintained by Parent Managing GP or its Subsidiaries on the same
basis as such eligibility to participate is provided to similarly situated
employees of Parent Managing GP or its Subsidiaries.

 

(b) For all purposes (including purposes of vesting, eligibility to
participate and level of benefits) under the employee benefit plans of Parent
Managing GP and its Subsidiaries providing benefits to any MLP Employees after
the Effective Time as required pursuant to this _Section 5.13(b)_ (the " _New
Plans_ "), each MLP Employee shall be credited with his or her years of
service with MLP and its Subsidiaries and their respective predecessors before
the Effective Time, to the same extent as such MLP Employee was entitled,
before the Effective Time, to credit for such service under any similar MLP
Benefit Plan in which such MLP Employee participated or was eligible to
participate immediately prior to the Effective Time; _provided_ that the
foregoing shall not apply with respect to either benefit accrual attributable
to any period prior to the Effective Time under any defined benefit pension
plan, or to the extent that its application would result in a duplication of
benefits. In addition, to the extent such MLP Employee is eligible to
participate in a New Plan pursuant to  _Section 5.13(a)_, and without
limiting the generality of the foregoing, (i) each MLP Employee shall be
immediately eligible to participate, without any waiting time, in any and all
New Plans of the same type as any MLP Benefit Plans in which such MLP
Employee participated immediately before the consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby (such plans, collectively, the " _Old Plans_ "), and (ii)
for purposes of each New Plan providing medical, dental, pharmaceutical
and/or vision benefits to any MLP Employee, Parent shall cause all pre-
existing condition exclusions and actively-at-work requirements of such New
Plan to be waived for such employee and his or her covered dependents, unless
such conditions would not have been waived under the comparable plans of MLP
or its Subsidiaries in which such employee participated immediately prior to
the Effective Time, and Parent shall cause any eligible expenses incurred by
such employee and his or her covered dependents during the portion of the
plan year of the Old Plan ending on the date such employees participation in
the corresponding New Plan begins to be taken into account under such New Plan
for purposes of satisfying all deductible, coinsurance and maximum out-of-
pocket requirements applicable to such employee and his or her covered
dependents for the applicable plan year as if such amounts had been paid in
accordance with such New Plan.

 

(c) Parent hereby acknowledges that (i) a "change of control" (or similar
phrase) within the meaning of the MLP Equity Plans will occur as of the
Effective Time and (ii) a "change of control" (or similar phrase) within the
meaning of the MLP Benefit Plans (other than any MLP Equity Plans) set forth
in Section 5.13(c)(ii) of the MLP Disclosure Schedule will occur as of the
Effective Time.

 



54 (d) Upon the earlier to occur of March 1, 2014 and the date which is 30 days

annual bonus in an amount that is equal to the product of (A) such MLP
Employees previously established target 2013 annual bonus (as provided to
Parent in writing prior to the date hereof), multiplied by (B) a fraction
equal to the number of days elapsed in 2013, through and including the Closing
Date, divided by 365. If the Effective Time does not occur until calendar
year 2014, no new awards in respect of calendar year 2014 shall be made
pursuant to MLP GPs Annual Incentive Plan without the consent of Parent.

 

(e) Parent shall honor, or shall cause to be honored, all vacation that is
accrued and unused by each of the MLP Employees as of the Effective Time and
reflected on the balance sheet of MLP and its Subsidiaries (the " _Pre-Closing
Vacation_ ") in accordance with the terms of MLPs policies as in effect as of
immediately prior to the Effective Time, for the avoidance of doubt,
including the terms of such policies regarding the forfeiture and carryover of
such Pre-Closing Vacation. All vacation and paid time off that is accrued by
each MLP Employee following the Effective Time shall be subject to the
policies of Parent Managing GP.

(f) Nothing in this Agreement, expressed or implied, shall (i) confer upon any
MLP Employee or any other Person any right to continue in the employ or
service of Parent, the Surviving Entity or any Affiliate of Parent, or shall
interfere with or restrict in any way the rights of Parent, the Surviving
Entity or any Affiliate of Parent, which rights are hereby expressly
reserved, to discharge or terminate the services of any MLP Employee or any
Person at any time for any reason whatsoever, with or without cause, except to
the extent expressly provided otherwise in a written agreement between Parent,
the Surviving Entity or any Affiliate of Parent and the MLP Employee, (ii)
constitute an amendment to any MLP Benefit Plan or any employee benefit or
compensation plan of Parent Managing GP or any of its Affiliates, or (iii)
obligate Parent, the Surviving Entity or any Affiliate of Parent to maintain
any particular compensation or benefit plan, program arrangement, policy or
contract. Notwithstanding any provision in this Agreement to the contrary,
nothing in this  _Section 5.13_ shall create any third party rights in any
current or former service provider of MLP or its Affiliates (or any
beneficiaries or dependents thereof).

 

Section 5.14 _Listing_. Parent shall cause the Parent Units to be issued
pursuant to and in accordance with this Agreement to be approved for listing
(subject, if applicable, to notice of issuance) for trading on the NYSE prior
to the Closing.

Section 5.15  _Issuance of PIK Units; Distributions_.

(a) Any Class B Units issued as PIK Units prior to the Closing Date shall be
issued as of the close of business on the record date for the distribution of
such Class B Units issued as PIK Units.

 



55 (b) After the date of this Agreement until the Effective Time, each of Parent
and MLP shall coordinate with the other regarding the declaration of any
distributions in respect of Parent Units, Common Units and Class B Units and
the record dates and payment dates relating thereto, it being the intention of
the parties that holders of Common Units or Class B Units shall not receive,
for any quarter, distributions both in respect of Common Units or Class B
Units and also distributions in respect of Parent Units that they receive in
exchange therefor in the Merger, but that they shall receive for any such
quarter either: (i) only distributions in respect of Common Units or Class B
Units or (ii) only distributions in respect of Parent Units that they receive
in exchange therefor in the Merger.

 

Section 5.16 _Amendment of MLP Partnership Agreement_. The MLP Entities shall
amend the MLP Partnership Agreement, for no additional consideration or
undertaking by MLP or by the holders of the Class B Units, prior to the record
date for the MLP Unitholders Meeting, so that (i) Section 5.9(f) thereof
provides for the mandatory and automatic conversion of the Class B Units into
Common Units immediately prior to the Effective Time and (ii) the term
"Preference Termination Date" is defined as follows: "means with respect to a
Class B Unit the date such Class B Unit becomes eligible for conversion
pursuant to Section 5.9(c)(i), 5.9(c)(ii), 5.9(c)(iii) or is converted
pursuant to Section 5.9(f)."

to closing set forth in _Sections 6.1(b)_ and _6.1(c)_ (but for purposes of

Parent by written notice to the other to a date not later than August 31,
2014; _provided_ , _further_ , that the right to terminate this Agreement
under this _Section 7.1(b)(i)_ shall not be available (x) to a party if the

other party has filed (and is then pursuing) an action seeking specific
performance as permitted by _Section 8.8_; 

 



59 (ii) if any Restraint having the effect set forth in _Section 6.1(c)_ shall
be in effect and shall have become final and nonappealable; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that the right to terminate this Agreement under this _Section
7.1(b)(ii)_ shall not be available to a party if such Restraint was due

Willful Breach was not caused by, or within the Knowledge of, MLP and (z) MLP
takes appropriate actions to remedy such Willful Breach upon discovery

representations, warranties, covenants or agreements set forth in this
Agreement (or if any of the representations or warranties of MLP set forth in
this Agreement shall fail to be true), which breach or failure (A) would (if
it occurred or was continuing as of the Closing Date) give rise to the failure

of being cured, or is not cured by MLP within 30 days following receipt of
written notice from Parent of such breach or failure; _provided_ that Parent

representations, warranties, covenants or agreements set forth in this
Agreement (or if any of the representations or warranties of Parent set forth

(if it occurred or was continuing as of the Closing Date) give rise to the
failure of a condition set forth in _Section 6.3(a)_ or _(b)_ and (B) is
incapable of being cured, or is not cured, by Parent within 30 days following
receipt of written notice from MLP of such breach or failure; _provided_ that
MLP shall not have the right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this
_Section 7.1(d)_ if MLP is then in breach of any of the first three
sentences of _Section 5.1(b)_ or _Section 5.3_ or in material breach of any
of its other representations, warranties, covenants or agreements contained in
this Agreement; or

 

(ii) prior to the receipt of the MLP Unitholder Approval, in order to enter

Agreement as provided in _Section 7.1_, written notice thereof shall be
given to the other party or parties, specifying the provision of this
Agreement pursuant to which such termination is made, and this Agreement shall

, _7.2_ and _7.3_ and in the last sentence of _Section 5.6(a)_, and the

subject to  _Sections 7.3(e)_ and _7.3(f)_ , nothing shall relieve any party
hereto from any liability for any failure to consummate the Merger and the
other transactions contemplated hereby when required pursuant to this

covenant or other agreement contained in this Agreement.

Section 7.3 _Fees and Expenses_.

(a) In the event that (A) an Alternative Proposal shall have been publicly
proposed or publicly disclosed prior to, and not withdrawn at the time of,
the date of the MLP Unitholders Meeting (or, if the MLP Unitholders Meeting
shall not have occurred, prior to the termination of this Agreement pursuant
to _Section 7.1(b)(i)_ ), (B) this Agreement is terminated by MLP or Parent
pursuant to _Section 7.1(b)(i)_ or _Section 7.1(b)(iii)_ , and (C) MLP enters
into a definitive agreement with respect to, or consummates, any Alternative
Proposal within 12 months after the date this Agreement is terminated
(whether or not such Alternative Proposal is the same Alternative Proposal
referred to in clause (A)), then MLP shall pay to Parent a termination fee
equal to $134.5 million, less any Parent Expenses previously paid by MLP
pursuant to _Section 7.3(f)_ (the " _Termination Fee_ "), upon the earlier of
the public announcement that MLP has entered into such definitive agreement or
the consummation of any such transaction. For purposes of this  _Section
7.3(a)_, the term "Alternative Proposal" shall have the meaning assigned to
such term in _Section 8.13_, except that the references to "15% or more"
shall be deemed to be references to "50% or more."

(b) In the event this Agreement is terminated by MLP pursuant to _Section
7.1(b)(iii)_ in a case where an Adverse Recommendation Change has occurred,
by MLP pursuant to _Section 7.1(d)(ii)_ or by Parent pursuant to _Section

described in _Section 8.8_ ), then MLP shall pay to Parent, within two
business days after the date of termination, the Termination Fee.

 



61 (c) Without limiting Parents other remedies described in _Section 8.8_ , in
the event this Agreement is terminated by Parent pursuant to _Section
7.1(c)(iii)_ as a result of a Willful Breach by MLP, then MLP shall pay to
Parent, within two business days after the date of termination, the
Termination Fee.

 

(d) Any payment of the Termination Fee shall be made in cash by wire transfer
of same day funds to an account designated in writing by Parent. 

(e) In the event that MLP or Parent shall fail to pay the Termination Fee
required pursuant to this _Section 7.3_ when due, such fee shall accrue
interest for the period commencing on the date such fee became past due, at a
rate equal to the legal rate of interest provided for in Section 2301 of Title
6 of the Delaware Code. In addition, if MLP shall fail to pay the Termination
Fee when due, MLP shall also pay all of Parents reasonable costs and expenses
(including attorneys fees) in connection with efforts to collect such fee.
The MLP Entities and the Parent Entities acknowledge that the provisions of
this _Section 7.3_ are an integral part of the transactions contemplated
hereby and that, without these agreements, neither the MLP Entities nor the
Parent Entities would enter into this Agreement. The parties agree that in the
event that MLP pays the Termination Fee to Parent, no MLP Entity shall have
any further liability to any Parent Entity of any kind in respect of this
Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby, and that in no event shall
MLP be required to pay the Termination Fee on more than one occasion.

(f) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, in the event
of termination of this Agreement by (i) either party pursuant to _Section
7.1(b)(iii)_ (or a termination by MLP pursuant to a different provision of
_Section 7.1_ at a time when this Agreement was terminable pursuant to 
_Section 7.1(b)(iii)_) or (ii) Parent pursuant to _Section 7.1(c)(iii)_,
then MLP shall promptly, but in no event later than three business days after
receipt of an invoice (with supporting documentation) therefor from Parent,
pay Parents designee all of the reasonably documented out-of-pocket expenses
(including all fees and expenses of counsel, accountants, investment bankers,
financing sources, hedging counterparties, experts and consultants) incurred
by Parent, Merger Sub and their respective Affiliates in connection with this
Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby up to a maximum amount of
$20.0 million (the " _Parent Expenses_ "); _provided_ , _however_ , that in
no event shall MLP have any obligation to make any such payment if, at the
time of such termination, this Agreement was terminable by MLP pursuant to
_Section 7.1(d)(i)_.

the parties and delivered to the other parties.

 



63 Section 8.6 _Entire Agreement; No Third-Party Beneficiaries_. This Agreement,

brought and determined exclusively in the Delaware Court of Chancery and any
state appellate court therefrom within the State of Delaware (or, if the

would occur and that the parties would not have any adequate remedy at law in

sitting in the State of Delaware, this being in addition to any other remedy
