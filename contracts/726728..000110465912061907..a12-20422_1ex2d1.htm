_Exchange Fund_ "), in each case, for the sole benefit of the holders of
shares of Company Common Stock. Parent shall cause the Exchange Agent to make,
and the Exchange Agent shall make, payments of the Merger Consideration and
any amounts payable in respect of dividends or other distributions on shares
of Parent Common Stock in accordance with _Section 3.2(d)_ out of the
Exchange Fund in accordance with this Agreement, the Articles of Merger and

shall be paid to the Surviving Entity.

 



 

(b) _Share Transfer Books_. At the Effective Time, the share transfer books of
the Company shall be closed, and thereafter there shall be no further

herein. On or after the Effective Time, any Certificates presented to the
Exchange Agent or the Surviving Entity for any reason shall be exchanged for

formerly represented thereby.

 



 

(c) _Exchange Procedures_.

 



 

(i) As promptly as practicable following the Effective Time (but in no event
later than two (2) Business Days thereafter), the Surviving Entity shall cause
the Exchange Agent to mail (and to make available for collection by hand) to
each holder of record of a Certificate (A) a letter of transmittal (a "
_Letter of Transmittal_ "), which shall specify that delivery shall be
effected, and risk of loss and title to the Certificates shall pass only upon
proper delivery of the Certificates (or affidavits of loss in lieu thereof) to
the Exchange Agent, and which Letter of Transmittal shall be in such form and
have such other customary provisions as the Company and Parent may reasonably
agree upon, and (B) instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the
Certificates in exchange for the Merger Consideration into which the number of
shares of Company Common Stock previously represented by such Certificate
shall have been converted pursuant to this Agreement, together with any
amounts payable in respect of dividends or other distributions on shares of
Parent Common Stock in accordance with _Section 3.2(d)_ (which instructions
shall provide that, at the election of the surrendering holder, (1)
Certificates may be surrendered by hand delivery or otherwise or (2) the
Merger Consideration in exchange therefor, together with any amounts payable
in respect of dividends or other distributions on shares of Parent Common
Stock in accordance with _Section 3.2(d)_, may be collected by check or wire
transfer to the surrendering holder).

 



 

(ii) Upon surrender of a Certificate (or affidavit of loss in lieu thereof) to
the Exchange Agent, together with a Letter of Transmittal duly completed and
validly executed in accordance with the instructions thereto, and such other
documents as may reasonably be required by the Exchange Agent, the holder of
such Certificate shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor the Merger
Consideration for each share of Company Common Stock formerly represented by
such Certificate pursuant to the provisions of this _Article III_ plus a
check or wire transfer representing the amount of cash such holder is entitled
to receive in lieu of fractional shares of Parent Common Stock that such
holder has the right to receive pursuant to the provisions of _Section
3.1(b)_ and any amounts that such holder has the right to receive in respect
of dividends or other distributions on shares of Parent Common Stock in
accordance with _Section 3.2(d)_, to be mailed or delivered by wire transfer,
within two (2) Business Days following the later to occur of (A) the Effective
Time or (B) the Exchange Agents receipt of such Certificate (or affidavit of
loss in lieu thereof), and the Certificate (or affidavit of loss in lieu
thereof) so surrendered shall be forthwith cancelled. The Exchange Agent shall
accept such Certificates (or affidavits of loss in lieu thereof) upon
compliance with such reasonable terms and conditions as the Exchange Agent may
impose to effect an orderly exchange thereof in accordance with customary
exchange practices. Until surrendered as contemplated by this _Section 3.2_,
each Certificate shall be deemed, at any time after the Effective Time, to
represent only the right to receive, upon such surrender, the Merger

 



      
 

 



 

Consideration as contemplated by this _Article III_. No interest shall be
paid or accrued for the benefit of holders of the Certificates on the Merger
Consideration payable upon the surrender of the Certificates.

 



 

(iii) As promptly as practicable following the Effective Time (but in no event
later than two (2) Business Days thereafter), the Surviving Entity shall cause
the Exchange Agent (A) to issue to each holder of Book-Entry Shares that
number of uncertificated shares of Parent Common Stock that such holder is
entitled to receive pursuant to _Section 3.1(b)_ in respect of such Book-
Entry Shares, and (B) to issue and deliver to each holder of Book-Entry Shares
a check or wire transfer for any amounts payable in respect of dividends or
other distributions on shares of Parent Common Stock in accordance with
_Section 3.2(d)_ and any other amount such holder is entitled to receive in
lieu of fractional shares of Parent Common Stock that such holder has the
right to receive pursuant to the provisions of _Section 3.1(b)_, in each case
without such holder being required to deliver a Certificate or an executed
Letter of Transmittal to the Exchange Agent, and such Book-Entry Shares shall
then be canceled. No interest shall be paid or accrued for the benefit of
holders of Book-Entry Shares on the Merger Consideration payable in respect of
the Book-Entry Shares.

 



 

(iv) In the event of a transfer of ownership of shares of Company Common Stock
that is not registered in the transfer records of the Company, it shall be a
condition of payment that any Certificate surrendered in accordance with the
procedures set forth in this _Section 3.2(c)_ shall be properly endorsed or
shall be otherwise in proper form for transfer, or any Book-Entry Share shall
be properly transferred, and that the Person requesting such payment shall
have paid any transfer Taxes and other Taxes required by reason of the payment
of the Merger Consideration to a Person other than the registered holder of
the Certificate or Book-Entry Share surrendered or shall have established to
the reasonable satisfaction of Parent that such Tax either has been paid or is
not applicable.

 



 

(d) _Dividends with Respect to Parent Common Stock_. No dividends or other
distributions with respect to Parent Common Stock with a record date after the
Effective Time shall be paid to the holder of any unsurrendered Certificate
with respect to the shares of Parent Common Stock issuable hereunder, and all
such dividends and other distributions shall be paid by Parent to the Exchange
Agent and shall be included in the Exchange Fund, in each case until the
surrender of such Certificate (or affidavit of loss in lieu thereof) in
accordance with this Agreement. Subject to applicable Laws, following
surrender of any such Certificate (or affidavit of loss in lieu thereof) there
shall be paid to the holder thereof, without interest, (i) the amount of
dividends or other distributions with a record date after the Effective Time
theretofore paid with respect to such shares of Parent Common Stock to which
such holder is entitled pursuant to this Agreement and (ii) at the appropriate

date subsequent to such surrender payable with respect to such shares of
Parent Common Stock.

 



 

(e) _Termination of Exchange Fund_. Any portion of the Exchange Fund
(including any interest and other income received with respect thereto) which
remains

 



      
 

 



 

undistributed to the former holders of shares of Company Common Stock on the
first (1st) anniversary of the Effective Time shall be delivered to Parent,
upon demand, and any former holders of shares of Company Common Stock who have
not theretofore received any Merger Consideration (including any cash in lieu
of fractional shares and any applicable dividends or other distributions with
respect to Parent Common Stock) to which they are entitled under this _Article
III_ shall thereafter look only to Parent and the Surviving Entity for payment
of their claims with respect thereto.

 



 

(f) _No Liability_. None of Parent, Merger Sub, the Company, the Surviving
Entity or the Exchange Agent, or any employee, officer, director, agent or
Affiliate of any of them, shall be liable to any holder of shares of Company
Common Stock in respect of any part of the Merger Consideration delivered to a
public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or
similar Law. Any amounts remaining unclaimed by holders of any such shares
immediately prior to the time at which such amounts would otherwise escheat
to, or become property of, any Governmental Authority shall, to the extent
permitted by applicable Law, become the property of the Surviving Entity, free
and clear of any claims or interest of any such holders or their successors,
assigns or personal representatives previously entitled thereto.

 



 

Section 3.3 _Equity Awards_.

 



 

(a) _Company Options_. At the Effective Time, each then outstanding Company
Option, whether or not exercisable at the Effective Time, shall, by virtue of
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and without any action on the
part of the holders thereof, be deemed subject to a cashless exercise and the
holder of each Company Option shall be deemed to receive by virtue of such
deemed cashless exercise a number of shares of Company Common Stock equal to
(i) the number of shares of Company Common Stock subject to each Company
Option, less (ii) the number of shares of Company Common Stock equal in value
to the aggregate exercise price of each Company Option, assuming a fair market
value of a share of Company Common Stock equal to the closing price of the
Company Common Stock on the last completed trading day immediately prior to
the Closing. Immediately following such deemed cashless exercise, the net
number of shares of Company Common Stock deemed issued in connection with the
deemed cashless exercise of each Company Option hereunder shall be converted
into the right of the holder of the corresponding Company Option to receive
the Merger Consideration payable with respect to the Company Common Stock in
accordance with _Section 3.1(b)_ of this Agreement.

 



 

(b) _Company Restricted Stock_. Immediately prior to the Effective Time, any
then-outstanding shares of Company Restricted Stock shall become fully vested
and the Company shall be entitled to deduct and withhold such number of shares
of Company Common Stock otherwise deliverable upon such acceleration to
satisfy any applicable income and employment withholding Taxes (assuming a
fair market value of a share of Company Common Stock equal to the closing
price of the Company Common Stock on the last completed trading day
immediately prior to the Closing). All shares of Company Common Stock then-
outstanding as a result of the full vesting of the shares of Company
Restricted Stock and the satisfaction of any applicable income and employment
withholding Taxes shall have the right to receive the Merger Consideration in
accordance with the terms and conditions of this Agreement.

 



      
 

 



 

(c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, prior to the
Effective Time, the Company shall take all actions necessary to effectuate the
provisions of this _Section 3.3_.

 



 

Section 3.4 _Withholding Rights_. Parent, the Surviving Entity or the Exchange
Agent, as applicable, shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the Merger
Consideration and any amounts otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement to
any holder of shares of Company Common Stock such amounts as Parent, the
Surviving Entity or the Exchange Agent is required to deduct and withhold with
respect to the making of such payment under the Code, and the rules and
regulations promulgated thereunder, or any provision of applicable Tax Law. To
the extent that amounts are so deducted or withheld and paid over to the
appropriate Governmental Authority by Parent, the Surviving Entity or the
Exchange Agent, as applicable, such withheld amounts shall be treated for all
purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the Person in respect of
which such deduction and withholding was made by Parent, the Surviving Entity
or the Exchange Agent, as applicable.

 



 

Section 3.5 _Lost Certificates_. If any Certificate shall have been lost,
stolen or destroyed, then upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the
Person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if
required by the Surviving Entity, the posting by such Person of a bond in such
reasonable amount as the Surviving Entity may direct, as indemnity against any
claim that may be made against it with respect to such Certificate, the
Exchange Agent will issue in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed
Certificate the Merger Consideration to which the holder thereof is entitled
pursuant to this _Article III_.

 



 

Section 3.6 _Dissenters  Rights_. No dissenters or appraisal rights shall be
available with respect to the Merger or the other transactions contemplated by
this Agreement.

 



 

Section 3.7 _Fractional Shares_. No certificate or scrip representing
fractional shares of Parent Common Stock shall be issued upon the surrender
for exchange of Certificates or with respect to Book-Entry Shares, and such
fractional share interests shall not entitle the owner thereof to vote or to
any other rights of a stockholder of Parent. Notwithstanding any other
provision of this Agreement, each holder of shares of Company Common Stock
converted pursuant to the Merger who would otherwise have been entitled to
receive a fraction of a share of Parent Common Stock shall receive, in lieu
thereof, cash, without interest, in an amount equal to such fractional part of
a share of Parent Common Stock multiplied by the VWAP of Parent Common Stock.

 



 

Section 3.8 _LTIP Units_. Parent and the Company acknowledge that at the
Effective Time all outstanding LTIP Units shall be fully vested and that the
capital accounts of the holders of such LTIP Units shall be adjusted as
provided in clause (iii) of _Section 6.20_ hereof.

Section 4.7 _SEC Filings; Financial Statements_.

 



 

(a) The Company has filed with, or furnished (on a publicly available basis)
to, the SEC all forms, reports, schedules, statements and documents required
to be filed or furnished by it under the Securities Act or the Exchange Act,
as the case may be, including any amendments or supplements thereto, from and
after January 1, 2010 (collectively, the " _Company SEC Filings_ "). Each
Company SEC Filing, as amended or supplemented, if applicable, (i) as of its
date, or, if amended or supplemented, as of the date of the most recent
amendment or supplement thereto, complied in all material respects with the
requirements of the Securities Act or the Exchange Act, as the case may be,
and the applicable rules and regulations of the SEC thereunder, and (ii) did
not, at the time it was filed (or became effective in the case of registration
statements), or, if amended or supplemented, as of the date of the most recent
amendment or supplement thereto, contain any untrue statement of a material
fact or omit to state a material fact required to be stated therein or
necessary in order to make the statements made therein, in the light of the
circumstances under which they were made, not misleading. As of the date of
this Agreement, no Company Subsidiary is separately subject to the periodic
reporting requirements of the Exchange Act.

 



 

(b) Each of the consolidated financial statements contained or incorporated by
reference in the Company SEC Filings (as amended, supplemented or restated, if
applicable), including the related notes and schedules, was prepared (except
as indicated in the notes thereto) in accordance with GAAP applied on a
consistent basis throughout the periods indicated, and each such consolidated
financial statement presented fairly, in all material respects, the
consolidated financial position, results of operations, stockholders equity
and cash flows of the Company and its consolidated subsidiaries as of the
respective dates thereof and for the respective periods indicated therein
(subject, in the case of unaudited quarterly financial statements, to normal
year-end adjustments).

 



 

(c) The records, systems, controls, data and information of the Company and
the Company Subsidiaries that are used in the system of internal accounting
controls described in the following sentence are recorded, stored, maintained
and operated under means that are under the exclusive ownership and direct
control of the Company or the Company Subsidiaries or accountants, except for
any non-exclusive ownership and non-direct control that would not reasonably
be expected to have a materially adverse effect on the system of internal
accounting controls. The Company and the Company Subsidiaries have devised and
maintain a system of internal accounting controls sufficient to provide
reasonable assurances regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the
preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with
GAAP, including that: (1) transactions are executed only in accordance with
managements authorization; (2) transactions are recorded as necessary to
permit preparation of the financial statements of the Company and the Company
Subsidiaries and to maintain accountability for the assets of the Company and
the Company Subsidiaries; (3) access to such assets is permitted only in
accordance with managements authorization; (4) the reporting of such assets
is compared with existing assets at regular intervals; and (5) accounts, notes
and other receivables and inventory are recorded accurately, and proper and
adequate procedures are implemented to effect the collection thereof on a
current and timely basis. The Companys principal executive officer and its
principal financial officer have disclosed to the Companys auditors and the
audit committee of the Company Board (i) all significant deficiencies and

 



      
 

 



 

material weaknesses in the design or operation of internal controls over
financial reporting that are reasonably likely to adversely affect the
Companys ability to record, process, summarize and report financial data, and
(ii) any fraud, whether or not material, that involves management or other
employees who have a significant role in the Companys internal controls, and
the Company has made available to Parent copies of any material written
materials relating to the foregoing. The Company has established and maintains
disclosure controls and procedures (as such term is defined in Rule 13a-15
promulgated under the Exchange Act) designed to ensure that material
information relating to the Company required to be included in reports filed
under the Exchange Act, including its consolidated subsidiaries, is made known
to the Companys principal executive officer and its principal financial
officer by others within those entities, particularly during the periods in
which the periodic reports required under the Exchange Act are being prepared,
and, to the knowledge of the Company, such disclosure controls and procedures
are effective in timely alerting the Companys principal executive officer and
its principal financial officer to material information required to be
included in the Companys periodic reports required under the Exchange Act.
Since the enactment of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, none of the Company or any
Company Subsidiary has made any prohibited loans to any director or executive
officer of the Company (as defined in Rule 3b-7 promulgated under the Exchange
Act).

 



 

(d) Except as and to the extent disclosed or reserved against on the Companys
most recent balance sheet (or, in the notes thereto) included in the Company
SEC Filings, none of the Company or its consolidated subsidiaries has any
liabilities or obligations of any nature (whether accrued, absolute,
contingent or otherwise), except for liabilities or obligations (i) expressly
contemplated by or under this Agreement, including _Section 6.1_ hereof, (ii)
incurred in the ordinary course of business consistent with past practice
since the most recent balance sheet set forth in the Company SEC Filings made
through and including the date of this Agreement, (iii) described in any
section of the Company Disclosure Letter or (iv) that, individually or in the
aggregate, have not had and would not reasonably be expected to have a Company
Material Adverse Effect.

to the knowledge of the Company, none of the Company SEC Filings is the
subject of ongoing SEC review and the Company has not received any comments
from the SEC with respect to any of the Company SEC Filings since January 1,
2010 which remain unresolved, nor has it received any inquiry or information
request from the SEC as to any matters affecting the Company which has not
been adequately addressed. The Company has made available to Parent true and
complete copies of all written comment letters from the staff of the SEC
received since January 1, 2010 through the date of this Agreement relating to
the Company SEC Filings and all written responses of the Company thereto
through the date of this Agreement. None of the Company SEC Filings is the
subject of any confidential treatment request by the Company.

and delivery of this Agreement (the " _Parent Disclosure Letter_ ") (it being
agreed that disclosure of any item in any Section of the Parent Disclosure

standing under the laws of the State of Maryland and has the requisite
organizational power and authority and any necessary governmental
authorization to own, lease and, to the extent applicable, operate its
properties and to carry on its business as it is now being conducted. Parent
is duly qualified or licensed to do business, and is in good standing, in each
jurisdiction where the character of the properties owned, operated or leased
by it or the nature of its business makes such qualification, licensing or
good standing necessary, except for such failures to be so qualified, licensed
or in good standing that, individually or in the aggregate, have not had and
would not reasonably be expected to have a Parent Material Adverse Effect.

 



      
 

 



 

(b) Merger Sub is a limited liability company duly organized, validly existing
and in good standing under the laws of the State of Delaware and has the
requisite organizational power and authority and any necessary governmental
authorization to own, lease and, to the extent applicable, operate its

Sub is duly qualified or licensed to do business, and is in good standing, in
each jurisdiction where the character of the properties owned, operated or

had and would not reasonably be expected to have a Parent Material Adverse
Effect.

 



 

(c) Each Parent Subsidiary (other than Merger Sub) is duly organized, validly

authorization to own, lease and, to the extent applicable, operate its
properties and to carry on its business as it is now being conducted, except
for such failures to be so organized, in good standing or have certain power
and authority that, individually or in the aggregate, have not had and would
not reasonably be expected to have a Parent Material Adverse Effect. Each
Parent Subsidiary is duly qualified or licensed to do business, and is in good
standing, in each jurisdiction where the character of the properties owned,
operated or leased by it or the nature of its business makes such
qualification, licensing or good standing necessary, except for such failures
to be so qualified, licensed or in good standing that, individually or in the
aggregate, have not had and would not reasonably be expected to have a Parent
Material Adverse Effect.

 



 

(d) None of Parent, Merger Sub or any Parent Subsidiary, directly or

Person (other than in the Parent Subsidiaries and investments in short-term
investment securities).

Stock Plans, as of the date of this Agreement, there are no securities,
options, warrants, calls, rights, commitments, agreements, rights of first
refusal, arrangements or undertakings of any kind to which Parent, Merger Sub
or any other Parent Subsidiary is a party or by which any of them is bound,

Merger Sub nor any other Parent Subsidiary is a party to or bound by any

interests in any of the other Parent Subsidiaries.

 



 

(e) All dividends or other distributions on the shares of Parent Stock and any
material dividends or other distributions on any securities of any Parent
Subsidiary which have been authorized or declared prior to the date hereof

Section 5.4 _Authority_.

 



 

(a) Each of Parent and Merger Sub has the requisite corporate or limited
liability company power and authority, as applicable, to execute and deliver
this Agreement, to perform its obligations hereunder and, subject to receipt
of the Parent Stockholder Approval, to consummate the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement. The execution and delivery of this Agreement
by each of Parent and Merger Sub and the consummation by each of Parent and
Merger Sub of the transactions contemplated hereby have been duly and validly
authorized by all necessary corporate and limited liability company action,
and no other corporate or limited liability company proceedings on the part of
Parent or Merger Sub, as applicable, are necessary to authorize this Agreement
or the Merger or to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby, subject,

Merger Sub and, assuming due authorization, execution and delivery by the

bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium or other similar Laws
affecting creditors rights generally and by general principles of equity
(regardless of whether enforceability is considered in a proceeding in equity
or at law).

 



 

Section 5.5 _No Conflict; Required Filings and Consents_.

 



 

(a) The execution and delivery of this Agreement by each of Parent and Merger
Sub does not, and the performance of this Agreement and the consummation of
the Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby by each of Parent
and Merger Sub will not, (i) assuming receipt of the Parent Stockholder
Approval, conflict with or violate any provision of (A) the Parent Charter or
Parent Bylaws, Merger Subs certificate of formation or limited liability
company agreement or (B) any equivalent organizational or governing documents
of any other Parent Subsidiary, (ii) assuming that all consents, approvals,
authorizations and permits described in _Section 5.5(b)_ have been obtained,

other Parent Subsidiary is bound, or (iii) require any consent or approval
under, result in any breach of or any loss of any benefit or material increase
in any cost or obligation of Parent or any Parent

 



      
 

 



 

Subsidiary under, or constitute a default (or an event which with notice or
lapse of time or both would become a default) under, or give to others any
right of termination, acceleration or cancellation (with or without notice or
the lapse of time or both) of, or give rise to any right of purchase, first
offer or forced sale under or result in the creation of a Lien on any property
or asset of Parent, Merger Sub or any other Parent Subsidiary pursuant to, any
note, bond, debt instrument, indenture, contract, agreement, ground lease,
license, permit or other legally binding obligation to which Parent, Merger
Sub or any other Parent Subsidiary is a party, except, as to clauses (i)(B),
(ii) and (iii), respectively, for any such conflicts, violations, breaches,
defaults or other occurrences which, individually or in the aggregate, have
not had and would not reasonably be expected to have a Parent Material Adverse
Effect.

 



 

(b) The execution and delivery of this Agreement by each of Parent and Merger
Sub does not, and the performance of this Agreement by each of Parent and
Merger Sub will not, require any consent, approval, authorization or permit
of, or filing with or notification to, any Governmental Authority, except (i)
the filing with the SEC of (A) the Joint Proxy Statement and the Form S-4 and
the declaration of effectiveness of the Form S-4, and (B) such reports under,
and other compliance with, the Exchange Act (and the rules and regulations
promulgated thereunder) and the Securities Act (and the rules and regulations
promulgated thereunder) as may be required in connection with this Agreement

filings or notifications, individually or in the aggregate, has not had and

Section 5.6 _Permits; Compliance With Law_.

 



 

(a) Except for the authorizations, licenses, permits, certificates, approvals,
variances, exemptions, orders, franchises, certifications and clearances that
are the subject of _Section 5.14_ or _Section 5.16_, which are addressed
solely in those Sections, Parent, Merger Sub and each other Parent Subsidiary
is in possession of all authorizations, licenses, permits, certificates,
approvals, variances, exemptions, orders, franchises, certifications and
clearances of any Governmental Authority and accreditation and certification
agencies, bodies or other organizations, including building permits and
certificates of occupancy, necessary for Parent, Merger Sub and each other
Parent Subsidiary to own, lease and, to the extent applicable, operate its
properties or to carry on its respective business substantially as it is being
conducted as of the date hereof (the " _Parent Permits_ "), and all such
Parent Permits are valid and in full force and effect, except where the
failure to be in possession of, or the failure to be valid or in full force
and effect of, any of the Parent Permits, individually or in the aggregate,
has not had and would not reasonably be expected to have a Parent Material
Adverse Effect. All applications required to have been filed for the renewal
of Parent Permits have been duly filed on a timely basis with the appropriate
Governmental Authority, and all other filings required to have been made with
respect to such Parent Permits have been duly made on a timely basis with the
appropriate Governmental Authority, except in each case for failures to file
which, individually or in the

 



      
 

 



 

aggregate, have not had and would not reasonably be expected to have a Parent
Material Adverse Effect. Neither Parent nor any Parent Subsidiary has received
any claim or notice nor has any knowledge indicating that Parent or any Parent
Subsidiary is currently not in compliance with the terms of any such Parent
Permits, except where the failure to be in compliance with the terms of any
such Parent Permits, individually or in the aggregate, have not had and would
not reasonably be expected to have a Parent Material Adverse Effect.

 



 

(b) None of Parent, Merger Sub or any other Parent Subsidiary is or has been
in conflict with, or in default or violation of (i) any Law applicable to
Parent, Merger Sub or any other Parent Subsidiary or by which any property or
asset of Parent, Merger Sub or any other Parent Subsidiary is bound (except
for Laws addressed in _Section 5.10_, _Section 5.11_, _Section 5.14_,
_Section 5.15_ or _Section 5.17_), or (ii) any Parent Permits (except for
Parent Permits addressed in _Section 5.14_ or _Section 5.16_), except in
each case for any such conflicts, defaults or violations that, individually or
in the aggregate, have not had and would not reasonably be expected to have a
Parent Material Adverse Effect.

 



 

Section 5.7 _SEC Filings; Financial Statements_.

 



 

(a) Parent has filed with, or furnished (on a publicly available basis) to,
the SEC all forms, reports, schedules, statements and documents required to be
filed or furnished by it under the Securities Act or the Exchange Act, as the
case may be, including any amendments or supplements thereto, from and after
January 1, 2010 (collectively, the " _Parent SEC Filings_ "). Each Parent SEC
Filing, as amended or supplemented, if applicable, (i) as of its date, or, if
amended or supplemented, as of the date of the most recent amendment or
supplement thereto, complied in all material respects with the requirements of
the Securities Act or the Exchange Act, as the case may be, and the applicable
rules and regulations of the SEC thereunder, and (ii) did not, at the time it
was filed (or became effective in the case of registration statements), or, if
amended or supplemented, as of the date of the most recent amendment or
supplement thereto, contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to
state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to
make the statements made therein, in the light of the circumstances under
which they were made, not misleading. As of the date of this Agreement,
neither Merger Sub nor any other Parent Subsidiary is separately subject to
the periodic reporting requirements of the Exchange Act.

 



 

(b) Each of the consolidated financial statements contained or incorporated by
reference in the Parent SEC Filings (as amended, supplemented or restated, if
applicable), including the related notes and schedules, was prepared (except
as indicated in the notes thereto) in accordance with GAAP applied on a
consistent basis throughout the periods indicated, and each such consolidated
financial statement presented fairly, in all material respects, the
consolidated financial position, results of operations, stockholders equity
and cash flows of Parent and its consolidated subsidiaries as of the
respective dates thereof and for the respective periods indicated therein
(subject, in the case of unaudited quarterly financial statements, to normal
year-end adjustments).

 



 

(c) The records, systems, controls, data and information of Parent and the
Parent Subsidiaries that are used in the system of internal accounting
controls described in the following sentence are recorded, stored, maintained
and operated under means that are under the

 



      
 

 



 

exclusive ownership and direct control of Parent or the Parent Subsidiaries or
accountants, except for any non-exclusive ownership and non-direct control
that would not reasonably be expected to have a materially adverse effect on
the system of internal accounting controls. Parent and the Parent Subsidiaries
have devised and maintain a system of internal accounting controls sufficient
to provide reasonable assurances regarding the reliability of financial
reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in
accordance with GAAP, including that: (1) transactions are executed only in
accordance with managements authorization; (2) transactions are recorded as
necessary to permit preparation of the financial statements of Parent and the
Parent Subsidiaries and to maintain accountability for the assets of Parent
and the Parent Subsidiaries; (3) access to such assets is permitted only in
accordance with managements authorization; (4) the reporting of such assets
is compared with existing assets at regular intervals; and (5) accounts, notes
and other receivables and inventory are recorded accurately, and proper and
adequate procedures are implemented to effect the collection thereof on a
current and timely basis. Parents principal executive officer and its
principal financial officer have disclosed to Parents auditors and the audit
committee of the Parent Board (i) all significant deficiencies and material
weaknesses in the design or operation of internal controls over financial
reporting that are reasonably likely to adversely affect Parents ability to
record, process, summarize and report financial data, and (ii) any fraud,
whether or not material, that involves management or other employees who have
a significant role in Parents internal controls, and Parent has made
available to the Company copies of any material written materials relating to
the foregoing. Parent has established and maintains disclosure controls and
procedures (as such term is defined in Rule 13a-15 promulgated under the
Exchange Act) designed to ensure that material information relating to Parent
required to be included in reports filed under the Exchange Act, including its
consolidated subsidiaries, is made known to Parents principal executive
officer and its principal financial officer by others within those entities,
particularly during the periods in which the periodic reports required under
the Exchange Act are being prepared, and, to the knowledge of Parent, such
disclosure controls and procedures are effective in timely alerting Parents
principal executive officer and its principal financial officer to material
information required to be included in Parents periodic reports required
under the Exchange Act. Since the enactment of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, none of
Parent, Merger Sub or any other Parent Subsidiary has made any prohibited
loans to any director or executive officer of Parent (as defined in Rule 3b-7
promulgated under the Exchange Act).

 



 

(d) Except as and to the extent disclosed or reserved against on Parents most
recent balance sheet (or, in the notes thereto) included in the Parent SEC
Filings, none of Parent or its consolidated subsidiaries has any liabilities
or obligations of any nature (whether accrued, absolute, contingent or
otherwise), except for liabilities or obligations (i) expressly contemplated
by or under this Agreement, including _Section 6.2_ hereof, (ii) incurred in
the ordinary course of business consistent with past practice since the most
recent balance sheet set forth in the Parent SEC Filings made through and
including the date of this Agreement, (iii) described in any section of the
Parent Disclosure Letter or (iv) that, individually or in the aggregate, have
not had and would not reasonably be expected to have a Parent Material Adverse
Effect.

 



 

(e) To the knowledge of Parent, none of the Parent SEC Filings is the subject
of ongoing SEC review and Parent has not received any comments from the SEC
with respect to any of the Parent SEC Filings since January 1, 2010 which
remains unresolved, nor has it received any inquiry or information request
from the SEC as to any matters affecting Parent

 



      
 

 



 

which has not been adequately addressed. Parent has made available to the
Company true and complete copies of all written comment letters from the staff
of the SEC received since January 1, 2010 through the date of this Agreement
relating to the Parent SEC Filings and all written responses of Parent thereto
through the date of this Agreement. None of the Parent SEC Filings is the
subject of any confidential treatment request by Parent.

 



 

Section 5.8 _Disclosure Documents_.

 



 

(a) None of the information supplied or to be supplied in writing by or on
behalf of Parent, Merger Sub or any other Parent Subsidiary for inclusion or
incorporation by reference in (i) the Form S-4 will, at the time such document
is filed with the SEC, at any time such document is amended or supplemented or
at the time such document is declared effective by the SEC, contain any untrue
statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be
stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, or
(ii) the Joint Proxy Statement will, at the date it is first mailed to the
stockholders of the Company and of Parent, at the time of the Company
Stockholder Meeting and the Parent Stockholder Meeting, at the time the Form
S-4 is declared effective by the SEC or at the Effective Time, contain any
untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact
required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein, in
light of the circumstances in which they were made, not misleading. All
documents that Parent is responsible for filing with the SEC in connection
with the transactions contemplated herein, to the extent relating to Parent or
any Parent Subsidiary or other information supplied by or on behalf of Parent
or any Parent Subsidiary for inclusion therein, will comply as to form, in all
material respects, with the provisions of the Securities Act or Exchange Act,
as applicable and the rules and regulations of the SEC thereunder and each
such document required to be filed with any Governmental Authority (other than
the SEC) will comply in all material respects with the provisions of any
applicable Law as to the information required to be contained therein.

 



 

(b) The representations and warranties contained in this _Section 5.8_ will
not apply to statements or omissions included in the Form S-4 or the Joint
Proxy Statement to the extent based upon information supplied to Parent by or
on behalf of the Company.

 



 

Section 5.9 _Absence of Certain Changes or Events_. Between January 1, 2012
and the date hereof, except as contemplated by this Agreement or set forth on
_Section 5.9_ of the Parent Disclosure Letter, Parent, Merger Sub and each
other Parent Subsidiary has conducted its business in all material respects in
the ordinary course. Between January 1, 2009 and the date hereof, there has
not been any Parent Material Adverse Effect or any effect, event, development
or circumstance that, individually or in the aggregate with all other effects,
events, developments and changes, would reasonably be expected to result in a
Parent Material Adverse Effect.

 



 

Section 5.10 _Employee Benefit Plans_.

 



 

(a) _Section 5.10(a)_ of the Parent Disclosure Letter sets forth a true and
complete list of each material Parent Benefit Plan. Parent has delivered or
made available to the Company a true, correct and complete copy of each
material Parent Benefit Plan and, with respect thereto, if applicable, (i) all
amendments, trust (or other funding vehicle) agreements, summary plan
descriptions and insurance contracts, (ii) the most recent annual report

accountants reports) filed with the IRS, (iii) the most recent actuarial
report or other financial statement, (iv) the most recent determination letter
or opinion letter, if any, issued by the IRS, and any pending request for such
a letter, with respect to any Parent Benefit Plan intended to be qualified

correspondence with any Governmental Authority within the prior three (3)
years.

reasonably be expected to have a Parent Material Adverse Effect, each Parent
Benefit Plan has been established and administered in accordance with its
terms and in compliance with all applicable Laws, including ERISA and the
Code.

 



 

(c) Except as, individually or in the aggregate, have not had and would not
reasonably be expected to have a Parent Material Adverse Effect, each Parent
Benefit Plan that is intended to qualify under Section 401(a) of the Code has
either received a favorable determination letter from the IRS as to its
qualified status or may rely upon an opinion letter for a prototype plan and,
to Parents knowledge, nothing has occurred that could adversely affect the
qualified status of any such Parent Benefit Plan.

 



 

(d) There has been no prohibited transaction (within the meaning of Section
406 of ERISA or Section 4975 of the Code and other than a transaction that is
exempt under a statutory or administrative exemption) with respect to any
Parent Benefit Plan, except for any such transactions that, individually or in
the aggregate, have not had and would not reasonably be expected to have a
Parent Material Adverse Effect.

 



 

(e) There is no pending or, to the knowledge of Parent, threatened Action
against the Parent Benefit Plans, the assets of any of the trusts under such
Parent Benefit Plans, or against any fiduciary of the Parent Benefit Plans
with respect to the Parent Benefit Plans (other than routine claims for
benefits and appeals of such claims), except for any such Actions that,
individually or in the aggregate, have not had and would not reasonably be
expected to have a Parent Material Adverse Effect.

 



 

(f) No Parent Benefit Plan is, and none of Parent, Merger Sub, any Parent
Subsidiary or any of their respective ERISA Affiliates maintains, contributes
to, or participates in, or has ever maintained, contributed to, or
participated in, or otherwise has any obligation or liability in connection

(g) Except to the extent required by applicable Law and except as,

proposed final version of such document or response). Parent shall advise the
Company, promptly after it receives notice thereof, of the time of
effectiveness of the Form S-4, the issuance of any stop order relating thereto
or the suspension of the qualification of the Parent Common Stock issuable in
connection with the Merger for offering or sale in any jurisdiction, and
Parent and the Company shall use their reasonable best efforts to have any
such stop order or suspension lifted, reversed or otherwise terminated. Parent
shall also take any other action required to be taken under the Securities
Act, the Exchange Act, any applicable foreign or state securities or "blue
sky" Laws and the rules and regulations thereunder in connection with the
issuance of the Parent Common Stock in the Merger, and the Company shall
furnish all information concerning the Company and the holders of the Company
Common Stock as may be reasonably requested in connection with any such
actions.

 



 

(b) If, at any time prior to the receipt of the Company Stockholder Approval
or the Parent Stockholder Approval, any information relating to the Company or
Parent, or any of their respective Affiliates, should be discovered by the
Company or Parent which, in the reasonable judgment of the Company or Parent,
should be set forth in an amendment of, or a supplement to, any of the Form
S-4 or the Joint Proxy Statement, so that any of such documents would not
include any misstatement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact
necessary to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under
which they were made, not misleading, the party which discovers such
information shall promptly notify the other parties hereto, and the Company
and Parent shall cooperate in the prompt filing with the SEC of any necessary
amendment of, or supplement to, the Joint Proxy Statement or the Form S-4 and,
to the extent required by Law, in disseminating the information contained in
such amendment or supplement to stockholders of the Company and the
stockholders of Parent. Nothing in this _Section 6.3(b)_ shall limit the
obligations of any party under _Section 6.3(a)_. For purposes of _Section 4.8_
, _Section 5.8_ and this _Section 6.3_ , any information concerning or related
to the

 



      
 

 



 

Company, its Affiliates or the Company Stockholder Meeting will be deemed to
have been provided by the Company, and any information concerning or related
to Parent, its Affiliates or the Parent Stockholder Meeting will be deemed to
have been provided by Parent.

 



 

(c) As promptly as practicable following the date of this Agreement, the
Company shall, in accordance with applicable Law and the Company Charter and
Company Bylaws, establish a record date for, duly call, give notice of,
convene and hold the Company Stockholder Meeting. The Company shall use its
reasonable best efforts to cause the Joint Proxy Statement to be mailed to the
stockholders of the Company entitled to vote at the Company Stockholder
Meeting and to hold the Company Stockholder Meeting as soon as practicable
after the Form S-4 is declared effective under the Securities Act. The Company
shall, through the Company Board, recommend to its stockholders that they give
the Company Stockholder Approval, include such recommendation in the Joint
Proxy Statement and solicit and use its reasonable best efforts to obtain the
Company Stockholder Approval, except to the extent that the Company Board
shall have made an Adverse Recommendation Change as permitted by _Section
6.5(d)_. Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this _Section 6.3(c)_ ,
if, on a date for which the Company Stockholder Meeting is scheduled, the
Company has not received proxies representing a sufficient number of shares of
Company Common Stock to obtain the Company Stockholder Approval, whether or
not a quorum is present, the Company shall have the right to make one or more
successive postponements or adjournments of the Company Stockholder Meeting;
_provided_ that the Company Stockholder Meeting is not postponed or adjourned
to a date that is more than thirty (30) days after the date for which the
Company Stockholder Meeting was originally scheduled (excluding any
adjournments or postponements required by applicable Law).

 



 

(d) As promptly as practicable following the date of this Agreement, Parent
shall, in accordance with applicable Law and the Parent Charter and Parent
Bylaws, establish a record date for, duly call, give notice of, convene and
hold the Parent Stockholder Meeting. Parent shall use its reasonable best
efforts to cause the Joint Proxy Statement to be mailed to the stockholders of
Parent entitled to vote at the Parent Stockholder Meeting and to hold the
Parent Stockholder Meeting as soon as practicable after the Form S-4 is
declared effective under the Securities Act. Parent shall, through the Parent
Board, recommend to its stockholders that they give the Parent Stockholder
Approval, include such recommendation in the Joint Proxy Statement, and
solicit and use its reasonable best efforts to obtain the Parent Stockholder
Approval. Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this _Section 6.3(d)_ ,
if, on a date for which the Parent Stockholder Meeting is scheduled, Parent
has not received proxies representing a sufficient number of shares of Parent
Common Stock to obtain the Parent Stockholder Approval, whether or not a
quorum is present, Parent shall have the right to make one or more successive
postponements or adjournments of the Parent Stockholder Meeting; _provided_
that the Parent Stockholder Meeting is not postponed or adjourned to a date
that is more than thirty (30) days after the date for which the Parent
Stockholder Meeting was originally scheduled (excluding any adjournments or
postponements required by applicable Law). Nothing contained in this Agreement
shall be deemed to relieve Parent of its obligation to submit the Merger to
its stockholders for a vote on the approval thereof.

 



      
 

 



 

(e) The Company and Parent will use their respective reasonable best efforts
to hold the Company Stockholder Meeting and the Parent Stockholder Meeting on
the same date and as soon as reasonably practicable after the date of this
Agreement.

 



 

Section 6.4 _Access to Information; Confidentiality_.

 



 

(a) During the Interim Period, to the extent permitted by applicable Law and
contracts, and subject to the reasonable restrictions imposed from time to
time upon advice of counsel, each of the Company and Parent shall, and shall
cause each of the Parent Subsidiaries and the Company Subsidiaries,
respectively, to, afford to the other party and to the Representatives of such
other party reasonable access during normal business hours and upon reasonable
advance notice to all of their respective properties, offices, books,
contracts, commitments, personnel and records and, during such period, each of
the Company and Parent shall, and shall cause each of the Company Subsidiaries
and the Parent Subsidiaries, respectively, to, furnish reasonably promptly to
the other party (i) a copy of each report, schedule, registration statement
and other document filed by it during such period pursuant to the requirements
of federal or state securities Laws, and (ii) all other information (financial
or otherwise) concerning its business, properties and personnel as such other
party may reasonably request. Notwithstanding the foregoing, neither the
Company nor Parent shall be required by this _Section 6.4_ to provide the
other party or the Representatives of such other party with access to or to
disclose information (x) that is subject to the terms of a confidentiality
agreement with a third party entered into prior to the date of this Agreement
or entered into after the date of this Agreement in the ordinary course of
business consistent with past practice ( _provided_ , _however_ , that the
withholding party shall use its reasonable best efforts to obtain the required
consent of such third party to such access or disclosure), (y) the disclosure
of which would violate any Law or fiduciary duty ( _provided_ , _however_ ,
that the withholding party shall use its reasonable best efforts to make
appropriate substitute arrangements to permit reasonable disclosure not in
violation of any Law or fiduciary duty) or (z) that is subject to any
attorney-client, attorney work product or other legal privilege ( _provided_ ,
_however_ , that the withholding party shall use its reasonable best efforts
to allow for such access or disclosure to the maximum extent that does not
result in a loss of any such attorney-client, attorney work product or other
legal privilege). Each of the Company and Parent will use its reasonable best
efforts to minimize any disruption to the businesses of the other party that
may result from the requests for access, data and information hereunder. Prior
to the Effective Time, each of Parent and Merger Sub shall not, and shall
cause their respective Representatives and Affiliates not to, contact or
otherwise communicate with the employees of the Company or any Company
Subsidiary (other than those employees set forth on _Section 6.4(a)_ of the
Company Disclosure Letter) or other parties with which the Company or any
Company Subsidiary has a business relationship regarding the business of the
Company and the Company Subsidiaries or this Agreement and the transactions
contemplated hereby without the prior written consent of the Company.

 



 

(b) Each of the Company and Parent will hold, and will cause its
Representatives and Affiliates to hold, any nonpublic information, including
any information exchanged pursuant to this _Section 6.4_ , in confidence to
the extent required by and in accordance with, and will otherwise comply with,
the terms of the Confidentiality Agreements.

 



      
 

 



 

(c) Each of the Company and Parent agree to give prompt written notice to the
other upon becoming aware of the occurrence or impending occurrence of any
event or circumstance relating to it or any of the Company Subsidiaries or the
Parent Subsidiaries, respectively, which could reasonably be expected to have,
individually or in the aggregate, a Company Material Adverse Effect or a
Parent Material Adverse Effect, as the case may be.

 



 

Section 6.5 _Company Acquisition Proposals._

 



 

(a) Subject to the other provisions of this _Section 6.5_ , during the Interim
Period, the Company agrees that it shall not, and shall cause each of the
Company Subsidiaries not to, and shall not authorize and shall use reasonable
best efforts to cause its and their officers and directors, managers or
equivalent, and other Representatives not to, directly or indirectly through
another Person, (i) solicit, initiate, knowingly encourage or facilitate any
inquiry, discussion, offer or request that constitutes, or could reasonably be
expected to lead to, a Company Acquisition Proposal (an " _Inquiry_ "), (ii)
engage in any discussions or negotiations regarding, or furnish to any Third
Party any non-public information in connection with, or knowingly facilitate
in any way any effort by, any Third Party in furtherance of any Company
Acquisition Proposal or Inquiry, (iii) approve or recommend a Company
Acquisition Proposal, or enter into any letter of intent, memorandum of
understanding, agreement in principle, acquisition agreement, merger
agreement, share purchase agreement, asset purchase agreement, share exchange
agreement, option agreement or other similar definitive agreement (other than
an Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement entered into in accordance with this
_Section 6.5_ ) providing for or relating to a Company Acquisition Proposal
(an " _Alternative Acquisition Agreement_ "), or (iv) propose or agree to do
any of the foregoing.

 



 

(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this _Section 6.5_ , at any
time prior to obtaining the Company Stockholder Approval, the Company may,
directly or indirectly through any Representative, in response to an
unsolicited _bona fide_ written Company Acquisition Proposal by a Third Party
made after the date of this Agreement (that did not result from a breach of
this _Section 6.5_ ) (i) furnish non-public information to such Third Party
(and such Third Partys Representatives) making a Company Acquisition Proposal
( _provided_ , _however_ , that (A) prior to so furnishing such information,
the Company receives from the Third Party an executed Acceptable
Confidentiality Agreement, and (B) any non-public information concerning the
Company or the Company Subsidiaries that is provided to such Third Party
shall, to the extent not previously provided to Parent or Merger Sub, be
provided to Parent or Merger Sub prior to or substantially at the same time
that such information is provided to such Third Party), and (ii) engage in
discussions or negotiations with such Third Party (and such Third Partys
Representatives) with respect to the Company Acquisition Proposal if, in the
case of each of clauses (i) and (ii): (x) the Company Board determines in good
faith, after consultation with outside legal counsel and financial advisors,
that such Company Acquisition Proposal constitutes, or is reasonably likely to
result in, a Superior Proposal, and (y) the Company Board determines in good
faith, after consultation with outside legal counsel, that failure to take
such action would be inconsistent with the directors duties under applicable
Law; _provided_ , _however_ , that in each of the foregoing clauses (i) and
(ii), such Company Acquisition Proposal was not solicited in violation of
_Section 6.5_.

 



      
 

 



 

(c) The Company shall notify Parent promptly (but in no event later than 24
hours) after receipt of any Company Acquisition Proposal or any request for
nonpublic information relating to the Company or any Company Subsidiary by any
Third Party, or any Inquiry from any Person seeking to have discussions or
negotiations with the Company relating to a possible Company Acquisition
Proposal. Such notice shall be made orally and confirmed in writing, and shall
indicate the identity of the Third Party making the Company Acquisition
Proposal, request or Inquiry and the material terms and conditions of any
Company Acquisition Proposals, Inquiries, proposals or offers (including a
copy thereof if in writing and any related documentation or correspondence).
The Company shall also promptly, and in any event within 24 hours, notify
Parent orally and in writing, if it enters into discussions or negotiations
concerning any Company Acquisition Proposal or provides nonpublic information
or data to any Person in accordance with this _Section 6.5(c)_ and keep Parent
informed of the status and material terms of any such proposals, offers,
discussions or negotiations on a current basis, including by providing a copy
of all material documentation or material correspondence relating thereto.

 



 

(d) Except as permitted by this _Section 6.5(d)_ , neither the Company Board
nor any committee thereof shall (i) withhold, withdraw, modify or qualify (or
publicly propose to withhold, withdraw, modify or qualify), in a manner
adverse to Parent or Merger Sub, the Company Recommendation, (ii) approve,
adopt or recommend (or publicly propose to approve, adopt or recommend) any
Company Acquisition Proposal, (iii) fail to include the Company Recommendation
in the Joint Proxy Statement or any Schedule 14D-9, as applicable, (iv) fail
to publicly recommend against any Company Acquisition Proposal within ten (10)
Business Days of the request of Parent and/or reaffirm the Company
Recommendation within ten (10) Business Days of the request of Parent (any of
the actions described in clauses (i), (ii), (iii) and (iv) of this _Section
6.5(d)_ , an " _Adverse Recommendation Change_ "), or (v) approve, adopt,
declare advisable or recommend (or agree to, resolve or propose to approve,
adopt, declare advisable or recommend), or cause or permit the Company to
enter into, any Alternative Acquisition Agreement (other than an Acceptable
Confidentiality Agreement entered into in accordance with this _Section 6.5_
). Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement, at
any time prior to obtaining the Company Stockholder Approval, the Company
Board shall be permitted to effect an Adverse Recommendation Change if the
Company Board (x) has received an unsolicited _bona fide_ Company Acquisition
Proposal (that did not result from a breach of this _Section 6.5_ ) that, in
the good faith determination of the Company Board, after consultation with
outside legal counsel and financial advisors, constitutes a Superior Proposal,
after having complied with, and giving effect to all of the adjustments which
may be offered by Parent and Merger Sub pursuant to _Section 6.5(e)_ , and
such Company Acquisition Proposal is not withdrawn, and (y) determines in good
faith, after consultation with outside legal counsel, that failure to take
such action would be inconsistent with the directors duties under applicable
Law, and in such case the Company may (i) terminate this Agreement pursuant to
_Section 8.1(c)(ii)_ , (ii) make an Adverse Recommendation Change and/or (iii)
approve or recommend such Superior Proposal to the Companys stockholders and,
in the case of a termination, the Company may immediately prior to or
concurrently with such termination of this Agreement, enter into an
Alternative Acquisition Agreement with respect to such Superior Proposal
(provided, that in the event of any such termination, the Company complies
with its obligation to pay the Termination Payment pursuant to _Section
8.3(a)_ ).

 



       
 

 



 

(e) The Company Board shall not be entitled to effect an Adverse
Recommendation Change pursuant to _Section 6.5(d)_ unless (i) the Company has
provided a written notice (a " _Notice of Superior Proposal_ ") to Parent and
Merger Sub that the Company intends to take such action, specifying in
reasonable detail the reasons therefor and describing the material terms and
conditions of, and attaching a complete copy of, the Superior Proposal that is
the basis of such action (it being understood that such material terms shall
include the identity of the Third Party), (ii) during the five (5) Business
Day period following Parents and Merger Subs receipt of the Notice of
Superior Proposal, the Company shall, and shall cause its Representatives to,
negotiate with Parent and Merger Sub in good faith (to the extent Parent and
Merger Sub desire to negotiate) to make such adjustments in the terms and
conditions of this Agreement so that such Superior Proposal ceases to
constitute a Superior Proposal, and (iii) following the end of the five (5)
Business Day period, the Company Board shall have determined in good faith,
after consultation with outside legal counsel and financial advisors, taking
into account any changes to this Agreement proposed in writing by Parent and
Merger Sub in response to the Notice of Superior Proposal or otherwise, that
the Superior Proposal giving rise to the Notice of Superior Proposal continues
to constitute a Superior Proposal and, after consultation with outside legal
counsel, that failure to take such action would be inconsistent with the
directors duties under applicable Law. Any amendment to the financial terms
or any other material amendment of such Superior Proposal shall require a new
Notice of Superior Proposal, and the Company shall be required to comply again
with the requirements of this _Section 6.5(e)_; _provided_ , _however_ , that
references to the five (5) Business Day period above shall then be deemed to
be references to a three (3) Business Day period.

 



 

(f) Nothing contained in this _Section 6.5_ or elsewhere in this Agreement
shall prohibit the Company or the Company Board, directly or indirectly
through its Representatives, from disclosing to the Companys stockholders a
position contemplated by Rule 14e-2(a) or Rule 14d-9 promulgated under the
Exchange Act or making any disclosure to its stockholders if the Company Board
has determined, after consultation with outside legal counsel, that the
failure to do so would be inconsistent with applicable Law; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that any disclosure other than a "stop, look and listen" or
similar communication of the type contemplated by Rule 14d-9(f) promulgated
under the Exchange Act, an express rejection of any applicable Company
Acquisition Proposal or an express reaffirmation of the Company Recommendation
to the Companys stockholders in favor of the Merger shall be deemed to be an
Adverse Recommendation Change.

 



 

(g) The Company shall, and shall cause each of the Company Subsidiaries, and
its and their officers and directors, managers or equivalent, and other
Representatives to (i) immediately cease any existing discussions,
negotiations or communications with any Person conducted heretofore with
respect to any Company Acquisition Proposal and (ii) take such action as is
necessary to enforce any confidentiality provisions or provisions of similar
effect to which the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries is a party or
of which the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries is a beneficiary. The
Company shall use all reasonable efforts to cause all Third Parties who have
been furnished confidential information regarding the Company in connection
with the solicitation of or discussions regarding a Company Acquisition
Proposal within the six (6) months prior to the date of this Agreement to
promptly return or destroy such information (to the extent that the Company is
entitled to have such information returned or destroyed).

 



      
 

 



 

(h) For purposes of this Agreement:

 



 

(i) " _Company Acquisition Proposal_ " shall mean any proposal or offer for
(or expression by a Third Party that it is considering or may engage in),
whether in one transaction or a series of related transactions, (i) any
merger, consolidation, share exchange, business combination or similar
transaction involving the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries, (ii) any
sale, lease, exchange, mortgage, pledge, license, transfer or other
disposition, directly or indirectly, by merger, consolidation, sale of equity
interests, share exchange, joint venture, business combination or otherwise,
of any assets of the Company or any Company Subsidiary representing twenty
percent (20%) or more of the consolidated assets of the Company and the
Company Subsidiaries, taken as a whole as determined on a book-value basis,
(iii) any issue, sale or other disposition of (including by way of merger,
consolidation, joint venture, business combination, share exchange or any
similar transaction) securities (or options, rights or warrants to purchase,
or securities convertible into, such securities) representing twenty percent
(20%) or more of the voting power of the Company, (iv) any tender offer or
exchange offer in which any Person or "group" (as such term is defined in Rule
13d-3 promulgated under the Exchange Act) shall seek to acquire beneficial
ownership (as such term is defined in Rule 13d-3 promulgated under the
Exchange Act), or the right to acquire beneficial ownership, of twenty percent
(20%) or more of the outstanding shares of any class of voting securities of
the Company, or (v) any recapitalization, restructuring, liquidation,
dissolution or other similar type of transaction with respect to the Company
in which a Third Party shall acquire beneficial ownership of twenty percent
(20%) or more of the outstanding shares of any class of voting securities of
the Company; _provided_ , _however_ , that the term "Company Acquisition
Proposal" shall not include the Merger or the other transactions contemplated
by this Agreement.

 



 

(ii) " _Superior Proposal_ " shall mean a _bona fide_ written Company
Acquisition Proposal (except that, for purposes of this definition, the
references in the definition of "Company Acquisition Proposal" to "twenty
percent (20%)" shall be replaced by "fifty percent (50%)") made by a Third
Party on terms that the Company Board determines in good faith, after
consultation with the Companys outside legal counsel and financial advisors,
taking into account all financial, legal, regulatory and any other aspects of
the transaction described in such proposal, including the identity of the
Person making such proposal, any break-up fees, expense reimbursement
provisions and conditions to consummation, as well as any changes to the
financial terms of this Agreement proposed by Parent and Merger Sub in
response to such proposal or otherwise, to be (A) more favorable to the
Company and the Companys stockholders (solely in their capacity as such) from
a financial point of view than the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
and (B) reasonably likely to receive all required governmental approvals on a
timely basis and otherwise reasonably capable of being completed on the terms
proposed.

 



 

Section 6.6 _Appropriate Action; Consents; Filings_.

 



 

(a) Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement,
each of the Company and Parent shall and shall cause the Company Subsidiaries
and the Parent

 



      
 

 



 

Subsidiaries, respectively, to use its reasonable best efforts to take, or
cause to be taken, all actions, and to do, or cause to be done, and to assist
and cooperate with the other party in doing, all things necessary, proper or
advisable under applicable Law or pursuant to any contract or agreement to
consummate and make effective, as promptly as practicable, the Merger and the
other transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including (i) the taking of
all actions necessary to cause the conditions to Closing set forth in _Article
VII_ to be satisfied, (ii) the obtaining of all necessary actions or
nonactions, waivers, consents and approvals from Governmental Authorities or
other Persons necessary in connection with the consummation of the Merger and
the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the making of all
necessary registrations and filings (including filings with Governmental
Authorities, if any) and the taking of all reasonable steps as may be
necessary to obtain an approval or waiver from, or to avoid an action or
proceeding by, any Governmental Authority or other Persons necessary in
connection with the consummation of the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, (iii) the defending of any lawsuits or other
legal proceedings, whether judicial or administrative, challenging this
Agreement or the consummation of the Merger or the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, including seeking to have any stay or
temporary restraining order entered by any court or other Governmental
Authority vacated or reversed, the avoidance of each and every impediment
under any antitrust, merger control, competition or trade regulation Law that
may be asserted by any Governmental Authority with respect to the Merger so as
to enable the Closing to occur as soon as reasonably possible, and (iv) the
execution and delivery of any additional instruments necessary to consummate
the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement and to
fully carry out the purposes of this Agreement.

 



 

(b) In connection with and without limiting the foregoing, each of Parent and
the Company shall give (or shall cause the Parent Subsidiaries or the Company
Subsidiaries, respectively, to give) any notices to Third Parties, and each of
Parent and the Company shall use, and cause each of their respective
Affiliates to use, its reasonable best efforts to obtain any Third Party
consents not covered by _Section 6.6(a)_ that are necessary, proper or
advisable to consummate the Merger. Each of the parties hereto will furnish to
the other such necessary information and reasonable assistance as the other
may request in connection with the preparation of any required governmental
filings or submissions and will cooperate in responding to any inquiry from a
Governmental Authority, including promptly informing the other party of such
inquiry, consulting in advance before making any presentations or submissions
to a Governmental Authority, and supplying each other with copies of all
material correspondence, filings or communications between either party and
any Governmental Authority with respect to this Agreement. To the extent
reasonably practicable, the parties or their Representatives shall have the
right to review in advance and each of the parties will consult the others on,
all the information relating to the other and each of their Affiliates that
appears in any filing made with, or written materials submitted to, any
Governmental Authority in connection with the Merger and the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, except that confidential
competitively sensitive business information may be redacted from such
exchanges. To the extent reasonably practicable, neither the Company nor
Parent shall, nor shall they permit their respective Representatives to,
participate independently in any meeting or engage in any substantive
conversation with any Governmental Authority in respect of any filing,
investigation or other inquiry without giving the other party prior notice of
such meeting or conversation and, to the extent permitted by applicable Law,
without giving the other party the

 



      
 

 



 

opportunity to attend or participate (whether by telephone or in person) in
any such meeting with such Governmental Authority. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, obtaining any approval or consent from any third party pursuant to
this _Section 6.6(b)_ shall not be a condition to the obligations of Parent
and Merger Sub to consummate the Merger.

 



 

(c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, in connection
with obtaining any approval or consent from any Person (other than any
Governmental Authority) with respect to the Merger, none of the Company,
Parent, any of the Company Subsidiaries, any of the Parent Subsidiaries or any
of the their respective Representatives, shall be obligated to pay or commit
to pay to such Person whose approval or consent is being solicited any cash or
other consideration, make any accommodation or commitment or incur any
liability or other obligation to such Person. The parties shall cooperate with
respect to accommodations that may be requested or appropriate to obtain such
consents.

 



 

Section 6.7 _Notification of Certain Matters; Transaction Litigation_.

 



 

(a) The Company shall give prompt notice to Parent, and Parent shall give
prompt notice to the Company, of any notice or other communication received by
such party from any Governmental Authority in connection with this Agreement,
the Merger or the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement, or from
any Person alleging that the consent of such Person is or may be required in
connection with the Merger or the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement.

 



 

(b) The Company shall give prompt notice to Parent, and Parent shall give
prompt notice to the Company, if (i) any representation or warranty made by it
contained in this Agreement becomes untrue or inaccurate such that the
applicable closing conditions would reasonably expected to be incapable of
being satisfied by the Outside Date or (ii) it fails to comply with or satisfy
in any material respect any covenant, condition or agreement to be complied
with or satisfied by it under this Agreement; _provided_ , _however_ , that no
such notification shall affect the representations, warranties, covenants or
agreements of the parties or the conditions to the obligations of the parties
under this Agreement; _provided_ , _further_ , that the failure to provide
such prompt notice under this _Section 6.7(b)_ pursuant to clause (i) above
shall not constitute a breach of a covenant for purposes of _Section 7.2(b)_.

 



 

(c) The Company shall give prompt notice to Parent, and Parent shall give
prompt notice to the Company, of any Action commenced or, to such partys
knowledge, threatened against, relating to or involving such party or any of
the Company Subsidiaries or the Parent Subsidiaries, respectively, which
relate to this Agreement, the Merger or the other transactions contemplated by
this Agreement. The Company shall give Parent the opportunity to reasonably
participate in the defense and settlement of any stockholder litigation
against the Company and/or its directors relating to this Agreement and the
transactions contemplated hereby, and no such settlement shall be agreed to
without Parents prior written consent (which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed). Parent shall give the Company
the opportunity to reasonably participate in the defense and settlement of any
stockholder litigation against Parent and/or its directors relating to this
Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby, and no such settlement
shall be agreed to without the

 



      
 

 



 

Companys prior written consent (which consent shall not be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned or delayed).

 



 

Section 6.8 _Public Announcements_. The Company, Parent and Merger Sub shall,
to the extent reasonably practicable, consult with each other before issuing
any press release or otherwise making any public statements or filings with
respect to this Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated hereby, and
none of the parties shall issue any such press release or make any such public
statement or filing prior to obtaining the other parties consent (which
consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed);
_provided_ , _however_ , that a party may, without obtaining the other
parties consent, issue such press release or make such public statement or
filing as may be required by Law, Order or the applicable rules of any stock
exchange or the applicable provisions of any listing agreement of any party
hereto. If for any reason it is not practicable to consult with the other
party before making any public statement with respect to this Agreement or any
of the transactions contemplated hereby, then the party making such statement
shall not make a statement that is inconsistent with public statements or
filings to which the other party had previously consented; _provided_ ,
_further_ , that such consultation and consent shall not be required with
respect to any release, communication or announcement specifically permitted
by _Section 6.5_.

 



 

Section 6.9 _Directors  and Officers Indemnification and Insurance_.

 



 

(a) From and after the Effective Time, the Surviving Entity shall provide
exculpation, indemnification and advancement of expenses for each Indemnitee,
which is at least as favorable in scope and amount to such Indemnitee as the
exculpation, indemnification and advancement of expenses provided to such
Indemnitee by the Company and the Company Subsidiaries immediately prior to
the Effective Time in the Company Charter and the Company Bylaws or each of
the Company Subsidiaries respective articles or certificates of incorporation
or bylaws (or comparable organizational or governing documents), as in effect
on the date of this Agreement; _provided_ that such exculpation,
indemnification and advancement of expenses covers actions at or prior to the
Effective Time, including all transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

 



 

(b) Without limiting the provisions of _Section 6.9(a)_, during the period
commencing as of the Effective Time and ending on the sixth (6th) anniversary
of the Effective Time, Parent and the Surviving Entity shall (and Parent shall
cause the Surviving Entity to): (i) indemnify, defend and hold harmless each
Indemnitee against and from any costs or expenses (including attorneys fees),
judgments, fines, losses, claims, damages, liabilities and amounts paid in
settlement in connection with any Action, whether civil, criminal,
administrative or investigative, to the extent such Action arises out of or
pertains to (x) any action or omission or alleged action or omission in such
Indemnitees capacity as a director, officer, partner, member, trustee,
employee or agent of the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries, or (y)
this Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated hereby, including the
Merger; and (ii) pay in advance of the final disposition of any such Action
the expenses (including attorneys fees and any expenses incurred by any
Indemnitee in connection with enforcing any rights with respect to
indemnification) of any Indemnitee upon receipt of an undertaking by or on
behalf of such Indemnitee to repay such amount if it shall ultimately be
determined that such Indemnitee is not entitled to be indemnified.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement,

 



      
 

 



 

Parent or the Surviving Entity (i) shall not be liable for any settlement
effected without their prior written consent (which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned) and (ii) shall not have any
obligation hereunder to any Indemnitee to the extent that a court of competent
jurisdiction shall determine in a final and non-appealable order that such
indemnification is prohibited by applicable Law, in which case the Indemnitee
shall promptly refund to Parent or the Surviving Entity the amount of all such
expenses theretofore advanced pursuant hereto.

 



 

(c) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall or, if the Company is
unable to, Parent shall cause the Surviving Entity as of the Effective Time
to, obtain and fully pay the premium for the non-cancellable extension of the
coverage afforded by the Companys existing directors and officers liability
insurance policies and the Companys existing fiduciary liability insurance
policies (collectively, the " _D andO Insurance_"), in each case, for a claims
reporting or discovery period of at least six (6) years from and after the
Effective Time with respect to any claim related to any period or time at or
prior to the Effective Time from one or more insurance carriers with the same
or better credit rating as the Companys current insurance carrier with
respect to DandO Insurance with terms, conditions and retentions that are no
less favorable in the aggregate than the coverage provided under the Companys
existing policies and with limits of liability that are no lower than the
limits on the Companys existing policies as long as the annual premium in the
aggregate does not exceed 125% of the annual aggregate premium(s) under the
Companys existing policies. If the Company or the Surviving Entity for any
reason fails to obtain such "tail" insurance policies as of the Effective
Time, (i) the Surviving Entity shall continue to maintain in effect, for a
period of at least six (6) years from and after the Effective Time, the DandO
Insurance in place as of the date hereof with the Companys current insurance
carrier or with an insurance carrier with the same or better credit rating as
the Companys current insurance carrier with respect to DandO Insurance with
terms, conditions, retentions and limits of liability that are no less
favorable in the aggregate than the coverage provided under the Companys
existing policies as of the date hereof, or (ii) Parent shall provide, or
shall cause the Surviving Entity to provide, for a period of not less than six
(6) years after the Effective Time, the Indemnitees who are insured under the
Companys DandO Insurance with comparable DandO Insurance that provides coverage
for events occurring at or prior to the Effective Time from an insurance
carrier with the same or better credit rating as the Companys current
insurance carrier, that is no less favorable in the aggregate than the
existing policy of the Company (which may be provided under Parents DandO
Insurance policy) or, if substantially equivalent insurance coverage is
unavailable, the best available coverage; _provided_ , _however_ , that Parent
and the Surviving Entity shall not be required to pay an annual premium for
the DandO Insurance in excess of 300% of the annual premium currently paid by
the Company for such insurance; and _provided_ , _further_ , that if the
annual premiums of such insurance coverage exceed such amount, Parent or the
Surviving Entity shall be obligated to obtain a policy with the greatest
coverage available, with respect to matters occurring prior to the Effective
Time, for a cost not exceeding such amount.

 



 

(d) The Indemnitees to whom this _Section 6.9_ applies are intended to be
third-party beneficiaries of this _Section 6.9_. The provisions of this
_Section 6.9_ are intended to be for the benefit of each Indemnitee and his
or her successors, heirs, executors, trustees, fiduciaries, administrators or
representatives. Parent shall pay all reasonable expenses, including
attorneys

 



      
 

 



 

fees, that may be incurred by any Indemnitee in successfully enforcing the
indemnity and other obligations provided in this _Section 6.9_.

 



 

(e) The rights of each Indemnitee under this _Section 6.9_ shall be in

governing documents) of any of the Company Subsidiaries, or the Surviving
Entity or any of its subsidiaries, or under any applicable Law or under any
agreement of any Indemnitee or any employee with the Company or any of the
Company Subsidiaries listed in _Section 4.12_ the Company Disclosure Letter.
Nothing in this Agreement is intended to, shall be construed to or shall
release, waive or impair any rights to directors and officers insurance
claims under any policy that is or has been in existence with respect to the
Company or its officers, directors and employees, it being understood and
agreed that the indemnification provided for in this _Section 6.9_ is not
prior to, or in substitution for, any such claims under any such policies.

 



 

(f) Notwithstanding anything contained in _Section 9.1_ or _Section 9.7_ to
the contrary, this _Section 6.9_ shall survive the consummation of the Merger
indefinitely and shall be binding, jointly and severally, on all successors
and assigns of Parent, the Surviving Entity and its subsidiaries, and shall be
enforceable by the Indemnitees and their successors, heirs or representatives.
In the event that Parent or the Surviving Entity or any of its successors or
assigns consolidates with or merges into any other Person and shall not be the
continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation or merger,
or transfers or conveys all or a majority of its properties and assets to any
Person, then, and in each such case, proper provision shall be made so that
the successors and assigns of Parent or the Surviving Entity, as applicable,
shall succeed to the obligations set forth in this _Section 6.9_. The parties
acknowledge and agree that Parent guarantees the payment and performance of
the Surviving Entitys obligations pursuant to this _Section 6.9_.

for purposes of all Company Benefit Plans, and (b) terminate and discharge all
obligations of the Company and any Company Subsidiary with respect to each
lease or other agreement set forth in _Section 6.10_ of the Company
Disclosure Letter.

(b) the tangible property set forth on _Section 6.11(b)_ of the Company
Disclosure Letter shall be transferred by the Company to AR Capital, LLC in
consideration of $1.00 pursuant to a customary bill of sale or assignment and
assumption agreement but otherwise shall be on an "as-is," "where-is" and
"with-all-faults" basis with no representations, warranties or indemnities
whatsoever, and as a result of such assignment, neither Parent nor the
Surviving Entity shall have any interest in any such property and shall be
released from any leases or other obligations with respect thereto.

 



      
 

 



 

Section 6.12 _Certain Tax Matters_.

 



 

(a) Each of Parent and the Company shall use their reasonable best efforts to
cause the Merger to qualify as a reorganization within the meaning of Section
368(a) of the Code, including by executing and delivering the officers

action, or fail to take any action, that could reasonably be expected to cause

(b) Parent shall prepare, or cause to be prepared, and file, or cause to be
filed, any income Tax Returns of the Operating Partnership for the short

into account any amendments to the Partnership Agreement subsequent to the
filing of the income Tax Returns for the Operating Partnership for the prior
taxable year, to the extent Parent reasonably determines such preparation is
reasonably consistent with the Code. Parent shall provide to AR Capital, LLC a
copy of such Short Period Returns within forty-five (45) days prior to the

related to such stock) resulting from the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement by each individual who is subject to the

the Company immediately prior to the Effective Time are exempt under Rule

Section 6.18 _Incentive and Management Payments_.

 



 

(a) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth herein, Parent and

Note will be issued in accordance with the terms of the Incentive Listing Fee

Section 6.20 _Operating Partnership_.

 



 

(a) As of the Effective Time, Parent agrees to (i) cause the Operating
Partnership to enter into a " _Tax Matters Agreement_ " with certain of the
limited partners of the Operating Partnership in form and substance as set
forth in _Exhibit C_, (ii) guarantee the obligations of the Operating
Partnership under the Tax Matters Agreement, (iii) amend the Partnership
Agreement of the Operating Partnership in form and substance as set forth in
_Exhibit D_ (the " _Parent OP Agreement_ "), (iv) the "book-up" of the
capital accounts of the holders of LTIP Units in connection with the
contribution of cash to the Operating Partnership pursuant to the Contribution
Agreement, dated as of August 30, 2012, between the Company, the Operating
Partnership and the Additional Limited Partner, so that, to the extent
possible, the Economic Capital Account Balances of the LTIP Unit holders are
equal to the OP Unit Economic Balance. Parent hereby gives its consent to
permit holders of LTIP Units, to the extent not reduced as described in
_Section 6.20(b)_, to convert such LTIP Units into OP Units to the extent the
LTIP

 



      
 

 



 

Units qualify for conversion under the terms of the Partnership Agreement. Any
defined terms used in this _Section 6.20(a)_ not otherwise defined in this
Agreement shall have the same meaning ascribed to such terms in the
Partnership Agreement. Such OP Units shall be common OP Units or preferred OP
Units, as described in the Parent OP Agreement.

 



 

(b) As of the Effective Time, in accordance with the terms of the Omnibus OPP
Agreement Amendments, the aggregate number of issued and outstanding LTIP
Units will be reduced to an aggregate of 1,651,312 LTIP Units. Each right of a
limited partner in the Operating Partnership to redeem or exchange his or its
OP Units for Company Common Stock (or cash equivalents thereof) pursuant to
the Partnership Agreement outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time
shall be automatically converted into the right to redeem or exchange such OP
Units for a number of shares of Parent Common Stock (or cash equivalents
thereof) equal to the number of shares of Company Common Stock that such
limited partner would have received if the redemption or exchange occurred
immediately prior to the Effective Time and each LTIP Unit after taking into
account the Omnibus OPP Agreement Amendments shall be automatically converted
into such number of LTIP Units that, assuming a one-for-one exchange of LTIP
Units for OP Units, would have given the LTIP Unitholder the right to redeem
or exchange his or its LTIP Units (assuming a prior conversion of such LTIP
Units for an equal number of OP Units) for a number of shares of Parent Common
Stock (or cash equivalents thereof) equal to the number of shares of Company
Common Stock that such LTIP Unitholder (assuming a prior conversion of such
LTIP Units for an equal number of OP Units) would have received if the
redemption or exchange occurred immediately prior to the Effective Time. For
avoidance of doubt, from and after the Effective Time, each common OP Unit
shall be redeemable or exchangeable for one share of Parent Common Stock and
each LTIP Unit (after taking into account the Omnibus OPP Agreement
Amendments) will, subject to the terms of the amended Operating Partnership
Agreement, as set forth in clause (a) above, be convertible into one OP Unit.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, any exchange of common OP units in for Parent
stock or cash equivalents thereof shall be subject to the limitations set
forth in the Parent OP Agreement (including with respect to the limited
partners capital account balance).

 



 

Section 6.21 _Pending Acquisitions_. The Company shall use its (a) reasonable
best efforts to consummate each of the pending acquisitions contemplated by

reasonable efforts to consummate any of the acquisitions contemplated by the
agreements listed on _Section 6.1(c)(vii)(Part II)_ of the Company Disclosure
Letter (collectively, the " _Additional Acquisitions_ "), in each case on or
prior to the Closing Date and on the terms and subject to the conditions set
forth in such agreements as of the date hereof, as the same may be amended in
accordance with their terms; _provided_ , _however_ , that the Companys
obligations under this _Section 6.21_ shall not require the Company to
consummate any Pending Acquisitions or Additional Acquisitions if doing so
would not be in the best interests of the Company.

 



 

Section 6.22 _Joint Ventures_. Subject to the Parent complying with its
obligations as set forth in the following sentence of this _Section 6.22_ and
subject to the final proviso of this sentence, the Company shall, and shall
cause each applicable Company Subsidiary to, use its reasonable best efforts
to eliminate the minority interests in the joint ventures (collectively, the "
_Joint Venture Unwind Transactions_ ") set forth in _Section 1.1_ of the
Company Disclosure Letter;

 



       
 

 



 

 _provided_ , _however_ , with respect to the joint ventures listed as items
three through and including eight of _Section 1.1_ of the Company Disclosure
Letter, if the Company and the applicable Company Subsidiaries are unable to
eliminate the minority interests in one or more of such joint ventures by
acquiring or redeeming such minority interests, the Company agrees to use its
reasonable best efforts to sell, or cause its applicable Subsidiary to sell,
and Parent agrees to, and shall cause a Parent Subsidiary to, purchase, the
properties held by each such joint venture where the applicable minority
interests have not been so eliminated (the " _JV Sale Properties_ ") at the
price set forth opposite the name of each such JV Sale Property in _Section
6.22_ of the Company Disclosure Letter, the closing of which shall occur
concurrently with the Effective Time; _provided_ , further, however, any such
sale of the JV Sale Property owned by the joint venture listed as item four on
_Section 1.1_ of the Company Disclosure Letter shall be subject to a right of
first offer to acquire the applicable Company Subsidiarys interest in such
joint venture in accordance with the terms of the organizational documents of
such joint venture. Subject to the Parent complying with its obligations as
set forth in the preceding sentence in this _Section 6.22_, the Company shall
use its reasonable best efforts to effectuate the Joint Venture Unwind
Transactions at an aggregate net cost to the Company (without regard to
closing costs and closing adjustments) and/or the applicable Company
Subsidiaries (after taking into account any property sale proceeds that would
be distributed to the Company and/or the applicable Company Subsidiaries in
respect of its interests in the applicable joint ventures) not to exceed
$21,500,000 without the prior consent of Parent (not to be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned or delayed). To the extent any JV Sale Properties will
be sold by a Company Subsidiary to Parent or a Parent Subsidiary in accordance
with this _Section 6.22_, (i) the Company shall, and it shall cause the
applicable Company Subsidiary to, and (ii) the Parent shall, and it shall
cause the applicable Parent Subsidiary to, enter into a Purchase and Sale
Agreement, substantially in the form attached as _Section 6.22_ to the
Company Disclosure Letter, which Purchase and Sale Agreement shall govern the
other terms and conditions of such sale.

 



 

Section 6.23 _Termination of Annual Incentive Compensation Plan_. Unless
otherwise notified by Parent in writing, prior to the Effective Time, the
Company shall take or cause to be taken any and all actions (including plan
amendments) necessary or appropriate to terminate, without any payment or
payments thereunder in excess of $3,000,000 in the aggregate, the Companys
Annual Incentive Compensation Plan (the " _Annual Incentive Plan_ "),
effective no later than immediately prior to the Effective Time. The Company
acknowledges and agrees that upon the termination of the Annual Incentive
Plan, other than as set forth in the Omnibus OPP Agreement Amendments, no past
or current Annual Incentive Plan participant shall be entitled to any payment,
right, title or interest with respect to any amounts under the Annual
Incentive Plan, including without limitation in connection with the
termination of the Annual Incentive Plan.

 



 

Section 6.24 _Termination of Plan Participation_. Unless otherwise notified by
Parent in writing, prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall take or

effective no later than immediately prior to the Effective Time.

Time, Parent shall use reasonable efforts, at no cost to Parent or the
Surviving Entity, to substitute or replace the guaranties provided by Nicholas

listed as items 4 and 5 on _Section 4.24_ on the Company Disclosure Letter

Stockholder Approval or the Parent Stockholder Approval (except as otherwise
expressly noted), as follows:

 



 

(a) by mutual written agreement of each of Parent and the Company; or

 



 

(b) by either Parent or the Company, if:

 



 

(i) the Effective Time shall not have occurred on or before March 6, 2013 (the
" _Outside Date_ "); _provided_ , _however_ , the Outside Date will
automatically be extended to April 8, 2013 if as of March 6, 2013 all of the
conditions set forth in _Article VII_ (other than those conditions that by

been satisfied or waived by the party entitled to the benefit of the same,
other than the condition contained in _Section 7.2(g)_; _provided_ ,
_further_ , that the right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this
_Section 8.1(b)(i)_ shall not be available to any party if the failure of
such party (and in the case of Parent, including the failure of Merger Sub) to
perform any of its obligations under this Agreement has been a principal cause
of, or resulted in, the failure of the Merger to be consummated on or before
such date; or

 



 

(ii) any Governmental Authority of competent jurisdiction shall have issued an
Order permanently restraining, enjoining or otherwise prohibiting the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and such Order or other action
shall have become final and non-appealable; _provided_ , _however_ , that the
right to terminate this Agreement under this _Section 8.1(b)(ii)_ shall not
be available to a party if the issuance of such final, non-appealable Order
was primarily due to the failure of such party (and in the case of Parent,
including the failure of Merger Sub) to perform any of its obligations under
this Agreement, including pursuant to _Section 6.6_; or

 



 

(iii) the Company Stockholder Approval shall not have been obtained at a duly

thereof) at which the Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby
have been voted upon, _provided_ that the right to terminate this Agreement
under this _Section 8.1(b)(iii)_ shall not be available to the Company if the
failure to obtain such Company Stockholder Approval was primarily due to the
Companys failure to perform any of its obligations under this Agreement; or

 



 

(iv) the Parent Stockholder Approval shall not have been obtained at a duly
held Parent Stockholder Meeting (including any adjournment or postponement

 



      
 

 



 

thereof) at which the issuance of Parent Common Stock in connection with the
Merger has been voted upon, _provided_ that the right to terminate this
Agreement under this _Section 8.1(b)(iv)_ shall not be available to Parent if
the failure to obtain such Parent Stockholder Approval was primarily due to
Parents failure to perform any of its obligations under this Agreement; or

 



 

(c) by the Company:

 



 

(i) if Parent or Merger Sub shall have breached or failed to perform in any
material respect any of its representations, warranties, covenants or other
agreements set forth in this Agreement, which breach or failure to perform (x)
would, or would reasonably be expected to, result in a failure of a condition
set forth in _Section 7.3(a)_ or _Section 7.3(b)_ and (y) cannot be cured on
or before the Outside Date or, if curable, is not cured by Parent within
twenty (20) days of receipt by Parent of written notice of such breach or
failure; _provided_ that the Company shall not have the right to terminate
this Agreement pursuant to this _Section 8.1(c)_ if the Company is then in
breach of any of its respective representations, warranties, covenants or
agreements set forth in this Agreement such that the conditions set forth in
either _Section 7.2(a)_ or _Section 7.2(b)_ would not be satisfied; or

 



 

(ii) at any time prior to the receipt of the Company Stockholder Approval in
order to enter into an Alternative Acquisition Agreement with respect to a
Superior Proposal in accordance with _Section 6.5(d)_; _provided_ , that such
termination shall be null and void unless the Company shall concurrently pay
the Termination Payment in accordance with _Section 8.3_.

 



 

(d) by Parent, if:

 



 

(i) the Company shall have breached or failed to perform in any material
respect any of its representations, warranties, covenants or other agreements
set forth in this Agreement, which breach or failure to perform (x) would, or
would reasonably be expected to, result in a failure of a condition set forth
in _Section 7.2(a)_ or _Section 7.2(b)_ and (y) cannot be cured on or before
the Outside Date or, if curable, is not cured by the Company within twenty
(20) days of receipt by the Company of written notice of such breach or
failure; _provided_ that Parent shall not have the right to terminate this
Agreement pursuant to this _Section 8.1(d)(i)_ if Parent or Merger Sub are
then in breach of any of their respective representations, warranties,
covenants or agreements set forth in this Agreement such that the conditions
set forth in either _Section 7.3(a)_ or _Section 7.3(b)_ would not be
satisfied; or

 



 

(ii) (x) the Company Board shall have made an Adverse Recommendation Change,
(y) the Company shall have materially breached any of its obligations under
_Section 6.3_ or _Section 6.5_ or (z) the Company enters into an Alternative
Acquisition Agreement (other than an Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement
entered into in accordance with _Section 6.5_), _provided_ that the right to
terminate under _Section 8.1(d)(ii)(x)_ and _(y)_ shall not be available
after the receipt of the Company Stockholder Approval.

 



      
 

 



 

Section 8.2 _Effect of Termination_. In the event that this Agreement is
terminated and the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement are abandoned pursuant to _Section 8.1_, written notice thereof
shall be given to the other party or parties, specifying the provisions hereof
pursuant to which such termination is made and describing the basis therefor
in reasonable detail, and this Agreement shall forthwith become null and void
and of no further force or effect whatsoever without liability on the part of
any party hereto (or any of the Company Subsidiaries, Parent Subsidiaries or
any of the Companys or Parents respective Representatives), and all rights
and obligations of any party hereto shall cease; _provided_ , _however_ ,
that, notwithstanding anything in the foregoing to the contrary (a) no such
termination shall relieve any party hereto of any liability or damages
resulting from or arising out of any willful or intentional breach of this
Agreement; and (b) the Confidentiality Agreements, this _Section 8.2_,
_Section 8.3_, _Section 8.6_, _Article IX_ and the definitions of all
defined terms appearing in such sections shall survive any termination of this
Agreement pursuant to _Section 8.1_. If this Agreement is terminated as
provided herein, all filings, applications and other submissions made pursuant
to this Agreement, to the extent practicable, shall be withdrawn from the
Governmental Authority or other Person to which they were made.

 



 

Section 8.3 _Termination Fee_.

 



 

(a) If, but only if, the Agreement is terminated:

 



 

(i) by either the Company or Parent pursuant to _Section 8.1(b)(i)_ or
_Section 8.1(b)(iii)_ or by Parent pursuant to _Section 8.1(d)(i)_ and (A)
in the case of a termination pursuant to _Section 8.1(b)(i)_, the Parent
Stockholder Approval shall have been obtained and the Company Stockholder
Approval shall not have been obtained prior to such termination, (B) in any
such case the Company (x) receives or has received a Company Acquisition
Proposal after the date of this Agreement, which proposal has been publicly
announced and (y) within twelve (12) months of the termination of this
Agreement, consummates a transaction regarding, or executes a definitive
agreement which is later consummated with respect to, a Company Acquisition
Proposal, and (C) in the case of termination pursuant to _Section
8.1(b)(iii)_, such Company Acquisition Proposal has been withdrawn prior to
the date of the Company Stockholder Meeting (or any adjournment thereof), then
the Company shall pay, or cause to be paid, to Parent a fee equal to
$51,000,000 (the " _Termination Fee_ ") plus, if not previously paid pursuant
to _Section 8.3(a)(ii)_ below, the Expense Amount, by wire transfer of same
day funds to an account designated by Parent, not later than the consummation
of such transaction arising from such Company Acquisition Proposal; _provided_
, _however_ , that for purposes of this _Section 8.3(a)(i)_, the references
to "twenty percent (20%)" in the definition of Company Acquisition Proposal
shall be deemed to be references to "fifty percent (50%)";

 



 

(ii) by either the Company or Parent pursuant to _Section 8.1(b)(iii)_, the
Company shall pay, or cause to be paid, to Parent the Expense Amount (by wire
transfer to an account designated by Parent) within two (2) Business Days of
such termination; or

 



 

(iii) by either the Company or Parent pursuant to _Section 8.1(b)(iv)_, then
Parent shall pay, or cause to be paid, to the Company the Expense Amount (by
wire

 



      
 

 



 

transfer to an account designated by the Company) within two (2) Business Days
of such termination; or

 



 

(iv) by either the Company or Parent pursuant to _Section 8.1(b)(iii)_, and
the Company receives or has received a Company Acquisition Proposal after the
date of this Agreement, which proposal has been publicly announced and not
withdrawn prior to the date of the Company Stockholder Meeting and the Company
Board did not make an Adverse Recommendation Change, if the Company
subsequently enters into an acquisition agreement, merger agreement, share
purchase agreement, asset purchase agreement or other similar definitive
agreement with respect to a Company Acquisition Proposal within twelve (12)
months of the termination of this Agreement, the Company shall pay, or cause
to be paid, to Parent the Termination Fee plus, if not previously paid
pursuant to _Section 8.3(a)(ii)_ above, the Expense Amount, by wire transfer
of same day funds to an account designated by Parent, within two (2) Business
Days of entering into any such definitive agreement; _provided_ , _however_ ,
that for purposes of this _Section 8.3(a)(iv)_, the references to "twenty
percent (20%)" in the definition of Company Acquisition Proposal shall be
deemed to be references to "fifty percent (50%)"; or

 



 

(v) by the Company pursuant to _Section 8.1(c)(ii)_ then the Company shall
pay, or cause to be paid, to Parent the Termination Fee together with the
Expense Amount, by wire transfer of same day funds to an account designated by
Parent as a condition to the effectiveness of such termination; or

 



 

(vi) by Parent pursuant to _Section 8.1(d)(ii)_ , then the Company shall pay,
or cause to be paid, to Parent the Termination Fee together with the Expense
Amount, by wire transfer of same day funds to an account designated by Parent,
within two (2) Business Days of such termination.

 



 

(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement, the
parties agree that:

 



 

(i) under no circumstances shall the Company or Parent be required to pay the
Termination Fee or Expense Amount, as applicable, earlier than one (1) full
Business Day after receipt of appropriate wire transfer instructions from the
party entitled to payment; and

 



 

(ii) under no circumstances shall the Company or Parent be required to pay the
Termination Fee or Expense Amount, as applicable, on more than one occasion.

 



 

(c) Each of the parties hereto acknowledges that (i) the agreements contained
in this _Section 8.3_ are an integral part of the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement, (ii) the Termination Payment is not a penalty, but is
liquidated damages, in a reasonable amount that will compensate the Company or
Parent, as the case may be, in the circumstances in which such fee is payable
for the efforts and resources expended and opportunities foregone while
negotiating this Agreement and in reliance on this Agreement and on the
expectation of the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby, which
amount would otherwise be impossible to calculate with precision, and (iii)
without these agreements, the parties would not

 



      
 

 



 

enter into this Agreement; accordingly, if the Company or Parent, as the case
may be, fails to timely pay any amount due pursuant to this _Section 8.3_
and, in order to obtain such payment, either the Company or Parent, as the
case may be, commences a suit that results in a judgment against the other
party for the payment of any amount set forth in this _Section 8.3_, such
paying party shall pay the other party its costs and Expenses in connection
with such suit, together with interest on such amount at the annual rate of
five percent (5%) for the period from the date such payment was required to be
made through the date such payment was actually received, or such lesser rate
as is the maximum permitted by applicable Law.

 



 

(d) (i) If one party to this Agreement (the " _Termination Fee Payor_ ") is
required to pay another party to this Agreement (the " _Termination Fee Payee_
") a Termination Payment, such Termination Payment shall be paid into escrow
on the date such payment is required to be paid by the Termination Fee Payor
pursuant to this Agreement by wire transfer of immediately available funds to
an escrow account designated in accordance with this _Section 8.3(d)_. In the
event that the Termination Fee Payor is obligated to pay the Termination Fee
Payee the Termination Payment, the amount payable to the Termination Fee Payee
in any tax year of the Termination Fee Payee shall not exceed the lesser of
(i) the Termination Payment of the Termination Fee Payee, and (ii) the sum of
(A) the maximum amount that can be paid to the Termination Fee Payee without
causing the Termination Fee Payee to fail to meet the requirements of Section
856(c)(2) and (3) of the Code for the relevant tax year, determined as if the
payment of such amount did not constitute income described in Sections
856(c)(2) or 856(c)(3) of the Code (" _Qualifying Income_ ") and the
Termination Fee Payee has $1,000,000 of income from unknown sources during
such year which is not Qualifying Income (in addition to any known or
anticipated income which is not Qualifying Income), in each case, as
determined by the Termination Fee Payees independent accountants, plus (B) in
the event the Termination Fee Payee receives either (x) a letter from the
Termination Fee Payees counsel indicating that the Termination Fee Payee has
received a ruling from the IRS as described below in this _Section 8.3(d)_ or
(y) an opinion from the Termination Fee Payees outside counsel as described
below in this _Section 8.3(d)_, an amount equal to the excess of the
Termination Payment less the amount payable under clause (A) above.

 



 

(ii) To secure the Termination Fee Payors obligation to pay these amounts,
the Termination Fee Payor shall deposit into escrow an amount in cash equal to
the Termination Payment with an escrow agent selected by the Termination Fee
Payor on such terms (subject to this _Section 8.3(d)_) as shall be mutually
agreed upon by the Termination Fee Payor, the Termination Fee Payee and the
escrow agent. The payment or deposit into escrow of the Termination Payment
pursuant to this _Section 8.3(d)_ shall be made at the time the Termination
Fee Payor is obligated to pay the Termination Fee Payee such amount pursuant
to _Section 8.3_ by wire transfer. The escrow agreement shall provide that
the Termination Payment in escrow or any portion thereof shall not be released
to the Termination Fee Payee unless the escrow agent receives any one or
combination of the following: (i) a letter from the Termination Fee Payees
independent accountants indicating the maximum amount that can be paid by the
escrow agent to the Termination Fee Payee without causing the Termination Fee
Payee to fail to meet the requirements of Sections 856(c)(2) and (3) of the
Code determined as if the payment of such amount did not constitute Qualifying
Income and the Termination Fee Payee has $1,000,000 of income from unknown
sources during such year which is not Qualifying

 



      
 

 



 

Income (in addition to any known or anticipated income which is not Qualifying
Income), in which case the escrow agent shall release such amount to the
Termination Fee Payee, or (ii) a letter from the Termination Fee Payees
counsel indicating that (A) the Termination Fee Payee received a ruling from
the IRS holding that the receipt by the Termination Fee Payee of the
Termination Payment would either constitute Qualifying Income or would be
excluded from gross income within the meaning of Sections 856(c)(2) and (3) of
the Code or (B) the Termination Fee Payees outside counsel has rendered a
legal opinion to the effect that the receipt by the Termination Fee Payee of
the Termination Payment should either constitute Qualifying Income or should
be excluded from gross income within the meaning of Sections 856(c)(2) and (3)
of the Code, in which case the escrow agent shall release the remainder of the
Termination Payment to the Termination Fee Payee. The Termination Fee Payor
agrees to amend this _Section 8.3(d)_ at the reasonable request of the
Termination Fee Payee in order to (i) maximize the portion of the Termination
Payment that may be distributed to the Termination Fee Payee hereunder without
causing the Termination Fee Payee to fail to meet the requirements of Sections
856(c)(2) and (3) of the Code, (ii) improve the Termination Fee Payees
chances of securing a favorable ruling described in this _Section 8.3(d)_ or
(iii) assist the Termination Fee Payee in obtaining a favorable legal opinion
from its outside counsel as described in this _Section 8.3(d)_. Any amount of
the Termination Payment that remains unpaid as of the end of a taxable year
shall be paid as soon as possible during the following taxable year, subject
to the foregoing limitations of this _Section 8.3(d)_, _provided_ that the
obligation of the Termination Fee Payor to pay the unpaid portion of the
Termination Payment shall terminate on the December 31 following the date
which is five (5) years from the date of this Agreement.

 



 

Section 8.4 _Amendment_. Subject to compliance with applicable Law, this
Agreement may be amended by mutual agreement of the parties hereto by action
taken or authorized by their respective boards of directors (or similar
governing body or entity) at any time before or after receipt of the Company
Stockholder Approval or the Parent Stockholder Approval and prior to the
Effective Time; _provided_ , _however_ , that after the Company Stockholder
Approval or the Parent Stockholder Approval has been obtained, there shall not
be (a) any amendment of this Agreement that changes the amount or the form of
the consideration to be delivered under this Agreement to the holders of
Company Common Stock, or which by applicable Law or in accordance with the
rules of any stock exchange requires the further approval of the stockholders
of the Company or Parent without such further approval of such stockholders,
or (b) any amendment or change not permitted under applicable Law. This
Agreement may not be amended except by an instrument in writing signed by each
of the parties hereto.

 



 

Section 8.5 _Waiver_. At any time prior to the Effective Time, subject to
applicable Law, any party hereto may (a) extend the time for the performance
of any obligation or other act of any other party hereto, (b) waive any
inaccuracy in the representations and warranties of the other party contained
herein or in any document delivered pursuant hereto, and (c) subject to the
proviso of _Section 8.4_, waive compliance with any agreement or condition
contained herein. Any agreement on the part of a party hereto to any such
extension or waiver shall be valid only if set forth in an instrument in
writing signed by the party or parties to be bound thereby. Notwithstanding
the foregoing, no failure or delay by the Company, Parent or Merger Sub in

 



       
 

 



 

exercising any right hereunder shall operate as a waiver thereof nor shall any
single or partial exercise thereof preclude any other or further exercise of
any other right hereunder.

 



 

Section 8.6 _Fees and Expenses_. Except as otherwise provided in this
Agreement, all Expenses incurred in connection with this Agreement and the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement shall be paid by the party
incurring such expenses, whether or not the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement are consummated; _provided_ , _however_ , that the Company and
Parent shall share equally all Expenses related to the printing and filing of
the Form S-4 and the printing, filing and distribution of the Joint Proxy
Statement, other than attorneys and accountants fees.

 



 

Section 8.7 _Transfer Taxes_. Parent and the Company shall cooperate in the
preparation, execution and filing of all returns, questionnaires, applications
or other documents regarding any real property transfer or gains, sales, use,
transfer, value added, stock transfer or stamp taxes, any transfer, recording,
registration and other fees and any similar taxes that become payable in
connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (together with
any related interests, penalties or additions to Tax, " _Transfer Taxes_ "),
and shall cooperate in attempting to minimize the amount of Transfer Taxes.
From and after the Effective Time, the Surviving Entity shall pay or cause to
be paid, without deduction or withholding from any consideration or amounts
payable to holders of the Company Common Stock, all Transfer Taxes.

favoring or disfavoring any party by virtue of the authorship of any provision
of this Agreement. References to "this Agreement" shall include the Company

the meaning or interpretation of

 



      
 

 



 

this Agreement. Whenever the words "include," "includes" or "including" are
used in this Agreement, they shall be deemed to be followed by the words
"without limitation." The words "hereof," "herein" and "hereunder" and words
of similar import when used in this Agreement shall refer to this Agreement as
a whole and not to any particular provision of this Agreement. All terms
defined in this Agreement shall have the defined meanings when used in any

supplemented, including (in the case of statutes) by succession of comparable
successor Laws. References to a Person are also to its successors and
permitted assigns. All references to "dollars" or "$" refer to currency of the
United States of America.

 



 

Section 9.4 _Severability_. If any term or other provision of this Agreement
is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced under any present or future
Law, or public policy, (a) such term or other provision shall be fully
separable, (b) this Agreement shall be construed and enforced as if such
invalid, illegal or unenforceable provision had never comprised a part hereof,
and (c) all other conditions and provisions of this Agreement shall remain in
full force and effect and shall not be affected by the illegal, invalid or
unenforceable term or other provision or by its severance herefrom so long as
the economic or legal substance of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement is not affected in any manner materially adverse to any party. Upon
such determination that any term or other provision is invalid, illegal or
incapable of being enforced, the parties hereto shall negotiate in good faith
to modify this Agreement so as to effect the original intent of the parties as
closely as possible in a mutually acceptable manner in order that transactions
contemplated by this Agreement be consummated as originally contemplated to
the fullest extent possible.

 



 

Section 9.5 _Assignment; Delegation_. Other than to the Surviving Entity,
neither this Agreement nor any rights, interests or obligations hereunder
shall be assigned or delegated, in whole or in part, by any of the parties
hereto (whether by operation of Law or otherwise) without the prior written
consent of the other parties hereto.

 



 

Section 9.6 _Entire Agreement_. This Agreement (including the exhibits,
annexes and appendices hereto) constitutes, together with the Confidentiality
Agreements, the entire agreement between the parties with respect to the
subject matter hereof and thereof and supersedes all prior agreements and
understandings, both written and oral, among the parties, or any of them, with
respect to the subject matter hereof and thereof.

 



 

Section 9.7 _No Third-Party Beneficiaries_. This Agreement is not intended to
and shall not confer any rights or remedies upon any Person other than the
parties hereto and their respective successors and permitted assigns, except
for the provisions of _Section 6.9_ and _Section 6.18_ (which shall be to
the benefit of the parties referred to in such sections). The representations
and warranties in this Agreement are the product of negotiations among the
parties hereto and are for the sole benefit of the parties hereto. Any
inaccuracies in such representations and warranties are subject to waiver by
the parties hereto in accordance with _Section 8.5_ without notice or
liability to any other Person. The representations and warranties in

 



      
 

 



 

this Agreement may represent an allocation among the parties hereto of risks
associated with particular matters regardless of the knowledge of any of the
parties hereto. Accordingly, Persons other than the parties hereto may not
rely upon the representations and warranties in this Agreement as
characterizations of actual facts or circumstances as of the date of this
Agreement or as of any other date.

 



 

Section 9.8 _Specific Performance_. The parties hereto agree that irreparable
damage, for which monetary damages (even if available) would not be an
adequate remedy, would occur in the event that the parties hereto do not
perform the provisions of this Agreement (including failing to take such
actions as are required of it hereunder to consummate the Merger and the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement) in accordance with its specified
terms or otherwise breach such provisions. Accordingly, the parties
acknowledge and agree that the parties shall be entitled to an injunction,
specific performance and other equitable relief to prevent breaches of this
Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions hereof, in
addition to any other remedy to which they are entitled at Law or in equity.
Each of the parties agrees that it will not oppose the granting of an
injunction, specific performance and other equitable relief on the basis that
any other party has an adequate remedy at Law or that any award of specific
performance is not an appropriate remedy for any reason at Law or in equity.
Any party seeking an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of this
Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions of this
Agreement shall not be required to provide any bond or other security in
connection with any such order or injunction.

counterparts, and by the different parties hereto in separate counterparts,
each of which when executed shall be deemed to be an original but all of which
taken together shall constitute one and the same agreement. Delivery of an
executed counterpart of a signature page to this Agreement by facsimile
transmission or by e-mail of a pdf attachment shall be effective as delivery
of a manually executed counterpart of this Agreement.

 



 

Section 9.10 _Governing Law_. This Agreement and all Actions (whether based on
contract, tort or otherwise), directly or indirectly, arising out of or
relating to this Agreement or the actions of Parent, Merger Sub or the Company
in the negotiation, administration, performance and enforcement thereof, shall
be governed by, and construed in accordance with, the laws of the State of

 _OFFICER S CERTIFICATE_

 



 

The undersigned officer of American Realty Capital Trust, Inc., a Maryland
corporation (" _ARCT_ "), in connection with the opinions as to certain tax
matters to be delivered by Proskauer Rose LLP and Latham and Watkins LLP,
pursuant to Sections 7.3(f) and 7.2(f), respectively, of the Agreement and
Plan of Merger (the " _Merger Agreement_ ")* dated as of September 6, 2012, by
and among ARCT, Realty Income Corporation, a Maryland corporation (" _Realty_
"), and Tau Acquisition LLC, a Delaware limited liability company and a wholly
owned subsidiary of Realty Income (" _Merger Sub_ "), and recognizing that
said counsel will rely on this Officers Certificate in delivering their
opinions, hereby certifies and represents that (i) the facts that relate to
the Merger and related transactions, as described in the Merger Agreement and
the Form S-4 filed in connection with the Merger, including the Joint Proxy
Statement contained therein, each as amended or supplemented through the date
hereof, are true, correct, and complete in all material respects, and (ii) the
following statements and representations stated herein are true, correct, and
complete:

 



 

1. The Merger will be consummated in compliance with the material terms and conditions of the Merger Agreement and in accordance with applicable state corporation and limited liability company laws. The Merger Agreement, the Form S-4 and the other documents described in the Form S-4 represent the entire understanding of ARCT with respect to the Merger. None of the terms and conditions contained in the Merger Agreement, the Form S-4 and the other documents described in the Form S-4 have been or will be waived or modified and each of the representations relating to the Merger and contained in the Merger Agreement, the Form S-4 and the other documents described in the Form S-4 is true, correct and complete in all material respects. The terms of the Merger Agreement and all other agreements entered into in connection therewith are the result of arms length negotiations. ARCT has bona fide business reasons for engaging in the Merger, in particular, to combine the business operations of Realty Income and ARCT.

 



 

2. The fair market value of the Realty Income Common Stock (together with any cash paid in lieu of fractional shares, the " _Merger Consideration_ ") received by each ARCT shareholder will be approximately equal to the fair market value of the ARCT Common Stock surrendered by such ARCT shareholder in the Merger.

 



 

3. Commencing with its taxable year ended December 31, 2008, ARCT has been organized and has operated in conformity with the requirements for qualification and taxation as a

  * Terms used herein shall have the meanings ascribed to them in, and shall be interpreted in accordance with, the applicable federal income tax law and regulations. Except as otherwise provided, capitalized terms used but not defined herein have the meaning ascribed to them in the Merger Agreement. Except as otherwise indicated, all "Section" references contained herein refer to sections of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended.

      
 

 



 

real estate investment trust within the meaning of Section 856 for all taxable
periods ending before the Merger. ARCT intends to continue to so qualify for
its taxable year that will end with the Merger.

 



 

4. Pursuant to the Merger, no holder of ARCT Common Stock will receive in exchange for ARCT Common Stock, directly or indirectly, any consideration other than the Merger Consideration. No ARCT shareholder will retain any rights in the ARCT Common Stock transferred to Realty Income or cancelled pursuant to the Merger. To the best knowledge of ARCT, neither Realty Income nor any person related (as defined in Treasury Regulation Section 1.368-1(e)(4)) to Realty Income has acquired ARCT Common Stock with consideration other than Realty Income Common Stock either directly or through any transaction, agreement or arrangement with any other person. Neither ARCT nor any person related (as defined in Treasury Regulation Section 1.368-1(e)(4) but without regard to Treasury Regulation Section 1.368-1(e)(4)(i)(A)) to ARCT has acquired ARCT Common Stock prior to and in connection with the Merger or otherwise as part of a plan of which the Merger is a part. No distribution has been made with respect to ARCT Common Stock (other than normal, regular, dividend distributions made pursuant to the historic dividend paying practice of ARCT), either directly or through any transaction, agreement or arrangement with any other person, except for distributions described in Section 857 as required for ARCTs continued treatment as a REIT (and in order to avoid any income or excise tax imposed on ARCT). For purposes of this representation, "redeem," "purchase," or "acquire" will include a redemption, purchase, or acquisition, as the case may be, actually or in substance, including through derivative transactions such as collars or put protection arrangements, which have the economic effect of a transfer of the burdens, benefits, or other aspects of ownership. ARCT has not made any distributions with respect to its stock prior to and in connection with the Merger or otherwise as part of a plan of which the Merger is a part, other than regular, normal dividends or distributions made to all holders of ARCT Common Stock on the relevant record date with respect to such dividends or distributions. To the knowledge of ARCT, Realty Income has no plan or intention to, after the Merger, make a dividend or other distribution with respect to Realty Income Common Stock to holders of Realty Income Common Stock who are former stockholders of ARCT other than regular, normal dividends or distributions made to all holders of ARCT Common Stock on the relevant record date with respect to such dividends or distributions.

 



 

5. To the knowledge of ARCT, none of the ARCT stockholders will cause their shares of Realty Income Common Stock issued in the Merger to be redeemed or reacquired by Realty Income, or caused any person related to Realty Income (within the meaning of Treasury Regulation Section 1.368-1(e)(4)) or any person acting as an intermediary for Realty Income or such related person to acquire such shares. For purposes of this representation, the term "redeem," "reacquire," or "acquire" includes a redemption, reacquisition, or acquisition, as the case may be, actually or in substance, including through derivative transactions such as collars or put protection arrangements, which have the economic effect of a transfer of the burdens, benefits, or other aspects of ownership.

 



      
 

 



 

6. No equity interests, or other rights or interests that could be treated as equity interests for U.S. federal income tax purposes, in ARCT are outstanding except for ARCT Common Stock.

 



 

7. The liabilities of ARCT assumed by Merger Sub (as determined under Section 357(d)) and the liabilities to which the transferred assets of ARCT are subject were incurred by ARCT in the ordinary course of its business.

 



 

8. ARCT conducts a "historic business" for purposes of Treasury Regulation Section 1.368-1(d), and no assets of ARCT have been sold, transferred, or otherwise disposed of that would prevent Realty Income from continuing such "historic business" or from using a "significant portion" of ARCTs "historic business assets" in a business following the Merger (as such terms are used in Treasury Regulation Section 1.368-1(d)).

 



 

9. Except (i) as otherwise provided in Section 8.3 of the Merger Agreement, (ii) as otherwise provided in that certain side letter dated September 6, 2012 by and among Realty Income, AR Capital, LLC and Nicholas S. Schorsch, and (iii) for certain fees for printing, filing and distribution services relating to the Form S-4 and Joint Proxy Statement, which Realty Income and ARCT have agreed to share equally, Realty Income, Merger Sub, ARCT, and the shareholders of ARCT will each pay their respective expenses, if any, incurred in connection with the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement.

 



 

10. There is no intercorporate indebtedness existing between Realty Income (or any of its subsidiaries, including Merger Sub), on the one hand, and ARCT (or any of its subsidiaries), on the other hand, that was issued, acquired or will be settled at a discount.

 



 

11. ARCT is not under the jurisdiction of a court in a "title 11 or similar case" within the meaning of Section 368(a)(3)(A).

 



 

12. Immediately prior to the Effective Time, the fair market value of the assets of ARCT will exceed the sum of its liabilities, plus the amount of liabilities, if any, to which the assets are subject.

 



 

13. The payment of cash, if any, in lieu of fractional shares of Realty Income Common Stock is solely for the purpose of avoiding the expense and inconvenience to Realty Income of issuing fractional shares and does not represent separately bargained-for consideration. The total cash consideration that will be paid in the Merger to ARCT shareholders instead of issuing fractional shares of Realty Income Common Stock will not exceed one percent of the total consideration that will be issued in the Merger to ARCT shareholders in exchange for their shares of ARCT Common Stock. The fractional share interests of each ARCT shareholder will be aggregated, and no ARCT shareholder, with the possible exception of shareholders whose holdings are in multiple accounts, held under separate names, held jointly or with multiple brokers, will receive cash in an amount equal to or greater than the value of one full share of Realty Income Common Stock.

 



      
 

 



 

14. None of the payments received (or to be received) by any shareholder-employee or shareholder-independent contractor of ARCT that are designated as compensation will be separate consideration for, or allocable to, any ARCT Common Stock held by such shareholder-employee or shareholder-independent contractor; none of the shares of Realty Income Common Stock received by any shareholder-employees or shareholder-independent contractor was (or will be) separate consideration for, or allocable to, any employment, consulting or similar arrangement or agreement; and the compensation paid (or to be paid) to any shareholder-employees or shareholder-independent contractor was (or will be) for services actually rendered or to be rendered and was (or will be) commensurate with amounts paid to third parties bargaining at arms length for similar services. No portion of the Merger Consideration will be received by a ARCT shareholder as a creditor, employee, or in any other capacity other than as a ARCT shareholder.

 



 

15. The Merger Agreement and the transactions contemplated therein represent the full and complete agreement among Realty Income, Merger Sub and the ARCT regarding the Merger, and there are no other written or oral agreements regarding the Merger other than those expressly referred to or contemplated in the Merger Agreement.

 



 

16. ARCT is an "investment company" as defined in Section 368(a)(2)(F)(iii) and Section 368(a)(2)(F)(iv). ARCT meets the requirements of Section 368(a)(2)(F)(i) because it is a REIT.

 



 

17. The Merger is effected pursuant to Maryland and Delaware statutes as a result of which the following events will occur simultaneously at the Effective Time: (i) all of the assets and liabilities of ARCT become the assets and liabilities of Merger Sub and (ii) ARCTs separate legal existence ceases.

 



 

18. ARCT will not take any position on any federal, state or local income or franchise tax return, or any other tax reporting position, that is inconsistent with the treatment of the Merger as a reorganization within the meaning of Section 368(a) and the Treasury Regulations promulgated thereunder.

 



 

19. The undersigned is authorized to make all of the representations set forth herein on behalf of ARCT.

 



 

[ _Signature Page Follows_]

 



      
 

 



 

ARCT understands that Proskauer Rose LLP, as special counsel to ARCT, and
Latham and Watkins LLP, as special counsel to Realty Income, will rely, without
further inquiry, on this Officers Certificate in rendering their opinions
concerning the treatment of the Merger as a reorganization within the meaning
of Section 368(a), and hereby commits to inform said counsel if, for any
reason, any of the foregoing representations or statements ceases to be true,
correct or complete prior to the Effective Time. ARCT also recognizes that the
opinions delivered by Proskauer Rose LLP and Latham and Watkins LLP will not
address any tax consequences of the Merger or any action in connection
therewith except as expressly set forth in the letters containing such
opinions

 



 

IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have, on behalf of ARCT, caused this Officers
Certificate to be executed on this day of ,
2012.

The undersigned officer of Realty Income Corporation, a Maryland corporation
(" _Realty Income_ "), in connection with the opinions as to certain tax
matters to be delivered by Proskauer Rose LLP and Latham and Watkins LLP
pursuant to Sections 7.3(f) and 7.2(f), respectively, of the Agreement and
Plan of Merger (the " _Merger Agreement_ ")* dated as of September 6, 2012, by
and among American Realty Capital Trust, Inc., a Maryland corporation ("
_ARCT_ "), Realty Income and Tau Acquisition LLC, a Delaware limited liability
company and a wholly owned subsidiary of Realty Income (" _Merger Sub_ "), and
recognizing that said counsel will rely on this Officers Certificate in
delivering their opinions, hereby certifies and represents that (i) the facts
that relate to the Merger and related transactions, as described in the Merger
Agreement and the Form S-4 filed in connection with the Merger, including the
Joint Proxy Statement contained therein, each as amended or supplemented
through the date hereof, are true, correct, and complete in all material
respects, and (ii) the following statements and representations stated herein
are true, correct, and complete:

 



 

1. The Merger will be consummated in compliance with the material terms and conditions of the Merger Agreement and in accordance with applicable state corporation and limited liability company laws. The Merger Agreement, the Form S-4 and the other documents described in the Form S-4 represent the entire understanding of Realty Income with respect to the Merger. None of the terms and conditions contained in the Merger Agreement, the Form S-4 and the other documents described in the Form S-4 have been or will be waived or modified and each of the representations relating to the Merger and contained in the Merger Agreement, the Form S-4 and the other documents described in the Form S-4 is true, correct and complete in all material respects. The terms of the Merger Agreement and all other agreements entered into in connection therewith are the result of arms length negotiations. Realty Income has bona fide business reasons for engaging in the Merger, in particular, to combine the business operations of Realty Income and ARCT. In addition, the shares issued to ARCTs shareholders in the Merger will be issued by Realty Income.

 



 

2. The fair market value of the Realty Income Common Stock (together with any cash paid in lieu of fractional shares, the " _Merger Consideration_ ") received by each ARCT shareholder will be approximately equal to the fair market value of the ARCT Common Stock surrendered by such ARCT shareholder in the Merger. No ARCT shareholder will retain

  * Terms used herein shall have the meanings ascribed to them in, and shall be interpreted in accordance with, the applicable federal income tax law and regulations. Except as otherwise provided, capitalized terms used but not defined herein have the meaning ascribed to them in the Merger Agreement. Except as otherwise indicated, all "Section" references contained herein refer to sections of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended.

      
 

 



 

any rights in the ARCT stock transferred to Realty Income or cancelled
pursuant to the Merger.

 



 

3. Commencing with its taxable year ended December 31, 1994, Realty Income has been organized and has operated in conformity with the requirements for qualification and taxation as a real estate investment trust (" _REIT_ ") within the meaning of Section 856 for all taxable periods ending before the Merger. Realty Income intends to continue to so qualify for the taxable period which includes the Merger.

 



 

4. Pursuant to the Merger, no holder of ARCT Common Stock will receive in exchange for ARCT Common Stock, directly or indirectly, any consideration other than the Merger Consideration. Neither Realty Income nor a person related to Realty Income as defined in Treasury Regulation Section 1.368-1(e)(4) (an " _Realty Income Related Person_ ") will acquire ARCT Common Stock for consideration other than the Merger Consideration issued in connection with the Merger. Realty Income has no current plan or intention to redeem or reacquire any shares of Realty Income Common Stock issued in the Merger. Realty Income has not acquired any ARCT Common Stock in connection with the Merger, and no Realty Income Related Person and no person acting as an intermediary for Realty Income or such related person (i) has acquired any ARCT Common Stock or (ii) has a plan or intention to acquire any Realty Income Common Stock issued in the Merger. For purposes of this representation, "redeem," "reacquire," or "acquire" will include a redemption, reacquisition or acquisition, as the case may be, actually or in substance, including through derivative transactions such as collars or put protection arrangements, which have the economic effect of a transfer of the burdens, benefits, or other aspects of ownership. To the knowledge of Realty Income, prior to and in connection with the Merger or otherwise as part of a plan of which the Merger is a part, no dividend or other distribution has been or will be made with respect to ARCT Common Stock, other than regular, normal dividends or distributions made to all holders of ARCT Common Stock on the relevant record date with respect to such dividends or distributions. Realty Income has no plan or intention to, after the Merger, make a dividend or other distribution with respect to Realty Income Common Stock to holders of Realty Income Common Stock who are former stockholders of ARCT other than regular, normal dividends or distributions made to all holders of ARCT Common Stock on the relevant record date with respect to such dividends or distributions.

 



 

5. Neither Realty Income nor Merger Sub has any plan or intention to sell or otherwise dispose of the assets of ARCT except for dispositions made in the ordinary course of business or transfers and successive transfers permitted under Treasury Regulation Section 1.368-2(k)(1).

 



 

6. Merger Sub was formed by Realty Income for the sole purpose of participating in the Merger, and prior to the Merger, Merger Sub did not own any material assets, have any liabilities or assets subject to any liabilities, or conduct any business activities. Merger Sub will be, at all times from the date of its formation until and including the Effective Time, disregarded as an entity separate from Realty Income for United States federal income tax purposes. There is no plan for Merger Sub to issue additional interests of its equity to any person other than Realty Income or for Realty Income to sell the equity interests of Merger Sub that it currently holds.

 



      
 

 



 

7. Neither Realty Income nor any Realty Income Related Person has any plan or intention to redeem or otherwise reacquire (or cause to be redeemed or reacquired) any of the Realty Income stock issued in the Merger (except for possible purchases of such shares that may be made by Realty Income on the open market as part of a repurchase program, which purchases and program satisfy the requirements of Revenue Ruling 99-58, 1999-2 C.B. 701). For purposes of this representation, the term "redeem," "reacquire," or "acquire" includes a redemption, reacquisition or acquisition, as the case may be, actually or in substance, including through derivative transactions such as collars or put protection arrangements, which have the economic effect of a transfer of the burdens, benefits, or other aspects of ownership.

 



 

8. Realty Income is in the same line of business as ARCT for purposes of Treasury Regulation Section 1.368-1(d)(2). Following the Merger, Realty Income, or a member of its qualified group of corporations (as defined in Treasury Regulation Section 1.368-1(d)(4)(ii)), will continue the "historic business" of ARCT or use a "significant portion" of ARCTs "historic business assets" in ** __** a business, as such terms are defined in Treasury Regulation Section 1.368-1(d). For purposes of the foregoing representation, Realty Income will be treated as owning its proportionate share of ARCTs business assets used in a business of any partnership in which members of Realty Incomes "qualified group" either own a "significant interest" or have "active and substantial management functions as a partner with respect to that partnership business" (as described in Treasury Regulation Section 1.368-1(d)(4)(iii)(B)).

 



 

9. Except (i) as otherwise provided in Section 8.3 of the Merger Agreement, (ii) as otherwise provided in that certain side letter dated September 6, 2012 by and among Realty Income, AR Capital, LLC and Nicholas S. Schorsch, and (iii) for certain fees for printing, filing and distribution services relating to the Form S-4 and Joint Proxy Statement, which Realty Income and ARCT have agreed to share equally, Realty Income, Merger Sub, ARCT, and the shareholders of ARCT will each pay their respective expenses, if any, incurred in connection with the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement.

 



 

10. There is no intercorporate indebtedness existing between Realty Income (or any of its subsidiaries, including Merger Sub), on the one hand, and ARCT (or any of its subsidiaries), on the other hand, that was issued, acquired or will be settled at a discount. Realty Income will not assume any liability of any of ARCTs shareholders in connection with the Merger.

 



 

11. Prior to the Merger, neither Realty Income nor any corporation affiliated with Realty Income owned, directly or indirectly, nor had Realty Income or any such affiliated corporation owned, directly or indirectly, during the five years preceding the Effective Time, any shares of stock of ARCT or securities, options, warrants or instruments giving the holder thereof the right to acquire ARCT stock or other securities issued by ARCT.

 



      
 

 



 

12. Immediately prior to the Effective Time, the fair market value of the assets of ARCT will exceed the sum of its liabilities, plus the amount of liabilities, if any, to which the assets are subject.

 



 

13. The payment of cash, if any, in lieu of fractional shares of Realty Income Common Stock is solely for the purpose of avoiding the expense and inconvenience to Realty Income of issuing fractional shares and does not represent separately bargained-for consideration. The total cash consideration that will be paid in the Merger to ARCT shareholders instead of issuing fractional shares of Realty Income Common Stock will not exceed one percent of the total consideration that will be issued in the Merger to ARCT shareholders in exchange for their shares of ARCT Common Stock. The fractional share interests of each ARCT shareholder will be aggregated, and no ARCT shareholder, with the possible exception of shareholders whose holdings are in multiple accounts, held under separate names, held jointly or held with multiple brokers, will receive cash in an amount equal to or greater than the value of one full share of Realty Income Common Stock.

 



 

14. None of the payments received (or to be received) by any shareholder-employee or shareholder-independent contractor of ARCT that are designated as compensation will be separate consideration for, or allocable to, any ARCT Common Stock held by such shareholder-employee or shareholder-independent contractor; none of the shares of Realty Income Common Stock received by any shareholder-employees or shareholder-independent contractor was (or will be) separate consideration for, or allocable to, any employment, consulting or similar arrangement or agreement; and the compensation paid (or to be paid) to any shareholder-employees or shareholder-independent contractor was (or will be) for services actually rendered or to be rendered and was (or will be) commensurate with amounts paid to third parties bargaining at arms length for similar services. No portion of the Merger Consideration will be received by a ARCT shareholder as a creditor, employee, or in any other capacity other than as a ARCT shareholder.

 



 

15. Realty Income will satisfy the information reporting requirements of Treasury Regulation Section 1.368-3 with respect to the Merger.

 



 

16. The Merger Agreement and the transactions contemplated therein represent the full and complete agreement among Realty Income, Merger Sub and the ARCT regarding the Merger, and there are no other written or oral agreements regarding the Merger other than those expressly referred to or contemplated in the Merger Agreement.

 



 

17. Realty Income is an "investment company" as defined in Section 368(a)(2)(F)(iii) and Section 368(a)(2)(F)(iv). Realty Income meets the requirements of Section 368(a)(2)(F)(i) because it is a REIT.

 



 

18. The Merger will be effected pursuant to Maryland and Delaware statutes as a result of which the following events will occur simultaneously at the Effective Time: (i) all of the assets and liabilities of ARCT become the assets and liabilities of Merger Sub and (ii) ARCTs separate legal existence ceases.

 



      
 

 



 

19. Realty Income, Merger Sub and, after the Merger, the Surviving Company will not take any position on any federal, state or local income or franchise tax return, or take any other tax reporting position, that is inconsistent with the treatment of the Merger as a reorganization within the meaning of Section 368(a) and the Treasury Regulations promulgated thereunder.

 



 

20. The undersigned are authorized to make all of the representations set forth herein on behalf of Realty Income and Merger Sub.

Realty Income and Merger Sub understand that Proskauer Rose LLP, as special
counsel to ARCT, and Latham and Watkins LLP, as special counsel to Realty

Time. Realty Income and Merger Sub also recognize that the opinions delivered
by Proskauer Rose LLP and Latham and Watkins LLP will not address any tax
consequences of the Merger or any action in connection therewith except as

Guarantee was concurrently provided to the lender and has not been rejected,

liable (as a guarantor or otherwise) for the debt that was guaranteed by the
Special LP, the Special LP has agreed to indemnify such other party subject to
the limits on the Special LPs obligations to make a payment as set forth in
the Guaranty.

Section 2.3 _Liquidation and Net Worth Maintenance_.

 



 

(a) If the REIT or its successor (or an affiliate of REIT or its successor)

Qualified Appraiser to value the Operating Partnerships assets and
liabilities and determine their Net Value. If the lower of the two appraisals

Net Value the Operating Partnership, (B) such third Appraiser shall select

determination. Such appraisal process shall be conducted at the expense of the
Special LP. As used herein, " _Qualified Appraiser_ " shall mean (A) an
individual and/or firm that is not, as of the date of appointment, and has not

days after the date of such determination, any future DRO of the Special LP
shall be reduced to the extent attributable to such violation.

2.3(b)_, the Operating Partnership shall promptly pay the Special LP an amount
of cash equal to the estimated Make Whole Amount applicable to such breach. If

Special LP exceeds the estimated Make Whole Amount, then the Operating
Partnership shall pay such excess to the Special LP promptly after such
determination, and if such estimated Make Whole Amount exceeds the true Make
Whole Amount, then the Special LP shall promptly refund such excess to the

this _Section 2.4_, the Operating Partnership shall pay, promptly after such
failure, a Make Whole Payment to the Special LP as a result of such failure
equal to the estimated Make Whole Amount applicable to such failure. If it is
determined that the true Make Whole Amount applicable to the Special LP
exceeds the estimated Make Whole Amount applicable to the Special LP, then the
Operating Partnership shall pay such excess to the Special LP promptly after
the date of such determination, and if such estimated Make Whole Amount
exceeds the true Make Whole Amount, then the Special LP shall pay such excess
to the Operating Partnership promptly after the date of such determination,
but only to the extent such excess was actually received by the Special LP.

to the maintenance of Capital Accounts are intended to comply with Regulations
promulgated under Section 704 of the Code, and shall be interpreted and

the Capital Accounts, or any debits or credits thereto (including debits or
credits relating to liabilities which are secured by contributed or
distributed assets or which are assumed by the Partnership, the General
Partner or any Limited Partner) are computed in order to comply with such
Regulations, the General Partner may make such modification; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that all allocations of Partnership income, gain, loss and
deduction continue to have "substantial economic effect" within the meaning of
Section 704(b) of the Code and that no Limited Partner is materially adversely
affected by any such modification. The General Partner may, in its sole
discretion, (a) make any adjustments that are necessary or appropriate to
maintain equality between the Capital Accounts of the Partners and the amount
of Partnership capital reflected on the Partnerships balance sheet, as
computed for book purposes, in accordance with Regulations Section
1.704-1(b)(2)(iv)(q) and (b) make any appropriate modifications in the event

other asset contributed or agreed to be contributed, as the context requires,

Partner.

the Partnership (either by themselves or pursuant to the power-of-attorney
granted to the General Partner in Section 8.02 hereof) and filed for recording
in the appropriate public offices within the State of Delaware or such other
jurisdiction to perfect or maintain the Partnership as a limited partnership,
to effect the admission, withdrawal or substitution of any Partner of the
Partnership, or to protect the limited liability of the Limited Partners as
limited partners under the laws of the State of Delaware or such other
jurisdiction.

be determined by the General Partner acting in good faith on the basis of such
quotations and other information as it considers, in its reasonable judgment,
appropriate.

 **2.01** ** ****_Formation of the Partnership_**. The Partnership is a
limited partnership formed pursuant to the provisions of the Act and upon the
terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement. Except as expressly provided
herein to the contrary, the rights and obligations of the Partners and
administration and termination of the Partnership shall be governed by the
Act. The Partnership Interest of each Partner shall be personal property for
all purposes.

Partnership, L.P." and the Partnerships business may be conducted under any
other name or names deemed advisable by the General Partner, including the

included in the Partnerships name where necessary for the purposes of
complying with the laws of any jurisdiction that so requires. The General
Partner in its sole and absolute discretion may change the name of the
Partnership at any time and from time to time and shall notify the Partners of
such change in the next regular communication by the Partnership to the
Partners. Notwithstanding any provision in this Agreement and without the
consent of any Limited Partner or other Person, the General Partner may amend

 **2.05** ** ****_Filing of Certificate and Perfection of Limited

Certificate (including the Certificate of Limited Partnership of the

necessary to cause the Partnership to be treated as a limited partnership

 **2.06** ** ****_Certificates Describing Partnership Units_**. The

Interests that were transferred and, if applicable, the Partnership shall
issue a new certificate to the transferor evidencing any Partnership Interests
registered in the name of the transferor that were not transferred.

 



 

Each Partnership Interest shall constitute a "security" within the meaning of,

 **ARTICLE III. _ 
BUSINESS OF THE PARTNERSHIP_**

 



 

 **3.01** ** ****_General Purpose_**. The purpose and nature of the business
to be conducted by the Partnership is (i) to conduct any business that may be
lawfully conducted by a limited partnership organized pursuant to the Act,
(ii) to enter into any partnership, joint venture or other similar arrangement
for the purpose of engaging in any of the foregoing or the ownership and
disposition of interests in any entity engaged in any of the foregoing and
(iii) to do anything necessary or incidental to the foregoing; provided,
however, that any business to be conducted by

 



      
 

 



 

the Partnership shall be limited to and conducted in such a manner as to
permit the Company at all times to qualify as a REIT, unless the Company
otherwise ceases to, or the Board of Directors determines that the Company
shall no longer, qualify as a REIT. In connection with the foregoing, and
without limiting the Companys right in its sole and absolute discretion to
cease qualifying as a REIT, the Partners acknowledge that the Company has
elected REIT status and the avoidance of income and excise taxes on the
Company inures to the benefit of all the Partners. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, the Partners agree that the Company may terminate or revoke its
status as a REIT under the Code at any time. The General Partner shall also be
empowered to do any and all acts and things necessary or prudent to ensure
that the Partnership will not be classified as a "publicly traded partnership"
taxable as a corporation for purposes of Section 7704 of the Code.

 

 ** **

 

 **ARTICLE IV. _ 
CAPITAL CONTRIBUTIONS AND ACCOUNTS_**

 



 

 **4.01** ** ****_Capital Contributions_**. The General Partner and each
Limited Partner has made (or shall be deemed to have made) a Capital
Contribution to the Partnership in exchange for the Partnership Units set
forth opposite such Partners name on _Exhibit A_ hereto, as it may be
amended or restated from time to time by the General Partner to the extent
necessary to reflect accurately sales, exchanges or other Transfers,
redemptions, Capital Contributions, the issuance of additional Partnership
Units or similar events having an effect on a Partners ownership of
Partnership Units.

 



 

 **4.02** ** ****_Additional Capital Contributions and Issuances of Additional
Partnership Units_**. Except as provided in this Section 4.02 or in Section
4.05 hereof, the Partners shall have no right or obligation to make any
additional Capital Contributions or loans to the Partnership. The General
Partner may contribute additional capital to the Partnership in its sole
discretion, from time to time, and receive additional Partnership Interests,
in the form of Class B Common Units, in respect thereof, as determined by the
General Partner.

 



 

 **4.03** ** ****_Additional Limited Partners_**. With the Consent of the
Class A Limited Partners, the General Partner may admit one or more Additional
Limited Partners to the Partnership from time to time, on terms and conditions
and for such Capital Contributions as may be established by the General
Partner. As a condition to being admitted to the Partnership, each Additional
Limited Partner shall execute an agreement to be bound by the terms and
conditions of this Agreement in form and substance reasonably acceptable to
the General Partner.

 



 

 **4.04** ** ****_Partnership Units_**.

 



 

(a) _Generally_. Partnership Interests shall be represented by Partnership
Units. Initially, following the Effective Date all Partnership Units shall be
designated as either "Class A Common Units" (" _Class A Common Units_"),
Class B Common Units (" _Class B Common Units_") or "Preferred Units" ("
_Preferred Units_ "). Except as expressly provided herein, Class A Common
Units and Class B Common Units shall entitle the holders thereof to equal
rights under this Agreement. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this
Agreement, any Partnership Units issued to the General Partner, the
Partnership or any Affiliate of the General Partner shall

 



      
 

 



 

be Class B Common Units, and any Partnership Units acquired by the General
Partner, the Partnership or any Affiliate of the General Partner from any
Limited Partner pursuant to _Sections 8.04_, _8.05_ or _8.06_ hereof or
otherwise, shall automatically be converted from a Class A Common Unit or
Preferred Unit to a Class B Common Unit.

 



 

(b) _Conversion of Certain Partnership Interests upon Effective Date_. As of
the Effective Date, the outstanding OP Units and LTIP Units will be converted
as follows(2):

 



 

(i) 6 OP Units held by ARCA will be converted into 6 Class A Common Units;

 



 

(ii) 305,984 LTIP Units held by AREP will be converted into 305,984 Class A
Common Units;

 



 

(iii) 18,908 OP Units held by AREP will be converted into 18,908 Class A

(v) 36,843 LTIP Units held by Kahane will be converted into 1,475 Preferred
Units; and

 



 

(vi) 45,546,772 OP Units held by the Previous General Partner will be
converted into 45,546,772 Class B Common Units.

 



 

(c) _Additional Partnership Units_. Subject to the terms and conditions of
_Section 4.03_ and _Section 4.04(a)_ hereof, the General Partner is hereby
authorized to cause the Partnership from time to time to issue to the Partners
(including the General Partner) or other Persons (i) Class A Common Units,
Class B Common Units or Preferred Units, or (ii) additional Partnership Units
in one or more new classes or series, with such designations, preferences and
relative, participating, optional or other special rights, powers and duties,
including, rights, powers and duties senior to the Limited Partners, approved
by the Consent of the Class A Limited Partners. No Person, including, without
limitation, any Partner or a transferee of any Partner, shall have any
preemptive, preferential, participation or similar right or rights to
subscribe for or acquire any Partnership Units.

 



 

 **4.05** ** ****_Additional Funding_**. If the General Partner determines
that it is in the best interests of the Partnership to provide for additional
Partnership funds (" **Additional Funds** ") for any Partnership purpose, the
General Partner may (i) cause the Partnership to obtain such funds from
outside borrowings, or (ii) elect to have the General Partner, the Company or
any of their Affiliates provide such Additional Funds to the Partnership
through loans or otherwise.

 



 

 **4.06** ** ****_Capital Accounts_**. A separate Capital Account shall be
established and maintained for each Partner.

  _(2) Numbers here to presume that the Conversion Factor is applied._

 



      
 

 



 

 **4.07** ** ****_Percentage Interests_**. If the number of outstanding Common
Units, Preferred Units or other class or series of Partnership Units increases
or decreases during a taxable year, each Partners Percentage Interest shall
be adjusted by the General Partner effective as of the effective date of each
such increase or decrease to a percentage equal to the number of Class A
Common Units, Class B Common Units, Preferred Units or other class or series
of Partnership Units held by such Partner divided by the aggregate number of
Class A Common Units, Class B Common Units, Preferred Units or other class or
series of Partnership Units, as applicable, outstanding after giving effect to
such increase or decrease. If the Partners Percentage Interests are adjusted
pursuant to this Section 4.07, the Net Income and Net Loss for the taxable
year in which the adjustment occurs shall be allocated between the part of the
year ending on the effective date of such adjustment and the part of the year
beginning on the following day either (i) as if the taxable year had ended on
the date of the adjustment or (ii) based on the number of days in each part.
The General Partner, in its sole and absolute discretion, shall determine
which method shall be used to allocate Net Income and Net Loss for the taxable
year in which the adjustment occurs. The allocation of Net Income and Net Loss
for the earlier part of the year shall be based on the Percentage Interests
before adjustment, and the allocation of Net Income and Net Loss for the later
part shall be based on the adjusted Percentage Interests.

 



 

 **4.08** ** ****_No Interest on Contributions_**. No Partner shall be
entitled to interest on its Capital Contribution.

 



 

 **4.09** ** ****_Return of Capital Contributions_**. No Partner shall be
entitled to withdraw any part of its Capital Contribution or its Capital
Account or to receive any distribution from the Partnership, except as
specifically provided in this Agreement. Except as otherwise provided herein,
there shall be no obligation to return to any Partner or withdrawn Partner any
part of such Partners Capital Contribution for so long as the Partnership
continues in existence.

 



 

 **4.10** ** ****_No Third-Party Beneficiary_**. Except as provided in Section
5.06(d)(ii) with respect to amounts contributed to restore a deficit Capital
Account balance following liquidation of the Partnership, no creditor or other
third party (other than an Indemnitee) having dealings with the Partnership
shall have the right to enforce the right or obligation of any Partner to make
Capital Contributions or loans or to pursue any other right or remedy
hereunder or at law or in equity, it being understood and agreed that the
provisions of this Agreement shall be solely for the benefit of, and may be
enforced solely by, the parties hereto, Indemnitees and their respective
successors and assigns. To the fullest extent permitted by law, none of the
rights or obligations of the Partners herein set forth to make Capital
Contributions or loans to the Partnership shall be deemed an asset of the
Partnership for any purpose by any creditor or other third party, nor may such
rights or obligations be sold, transferred or assigned by the Partnership or
pledged or encumbered by the Partnership to secure any debt or other
obligation of the Partnership or of any of the Partners. In addition, it is
the intent of the parties hereto that no distribution to any Limited Partner
shall be deemed a return of money or other property in violation of the Act.
However, if any court of competent jurisdiction holds that, notwithstanding
the provisions of this Agreement, any Limited Partner is obligated to return
such money or property, such obligation shall, to the fullest extent permitted
by law, be the obligation of such Limited Partner and not of the General
Partner. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, a deficit Capital
Account of a Partner shall not be deemed to be a liability of such Partner nor
an asset or property of the Partnership.

 



       
 

 



 

 **ARTICLE V.**

 

 ** _PROFITS AND LOSSES; DISTRIBUTIONS_**

 



 

 **5.01** ** ****_Allocation of Net Income and Net Loss_**. Except as

(d), Net Income for any Partnership year or other period shall be allocated in
the following manner and order of priority.

 



 

(i) _First,_ 100% to the holders of Preferred Units in accordance with their
respective Percentage Interests in an amount equal to the excess of such
holders Preferred Return Per Preferred Unit to the last day of the current
Partnership Year or other period, or to the date of redemption or exchange
with the General Partner to the extent such units are redeemed or exchanged
during such period over the cumulative Net Income previously allocated to such
holder;

 



 

(ii) _Second,_ 100% to the holders of Class A Common Units in accordance with
their respective Percentage Interests in an amount equal to the excess of such
holders cumulative distributions pursuant to Section 5.02(a)(ii) to the last
day of the current Partnership year or other period, or to the date of
redemption or exchange with the General Partner to the extent such units are
redeemed or exchanged during such period, over the Cumulative Net Income
previously allocated to such holder;

 



 

(iii) _Third_ , 100% to the holders of Class B Common Units in accordance with
their respective Percentage Interests.

 



 

(b) _Allocation of Net Loss_. Except as provided in Section 5.01(c), Net Loss

Class B Common Units in accordance with their Percentage Interests.

 



 

(c) _Regulatory Allocations_.

 



 

(i) _Minimum Gain Chargeback (Nonrecourse Liabilities)_. Except as otherwise
provided in Section 1.704-2(f) of the Regulations, if there is a net decrease
in Partnership Minimum Gain for any Partnership fiscal year, each Partner
shall be specially allocated items of Partnership income and gain for such
year (and, if necessary, subsequent years) in an amount equal to such
Partners share of the net decrease in Partnership Minimum Gain to the extent
required by Section 1.704-2(f) of the Regulations. The items to be so
allocated shall be determined in accordance with Sections 1.704-2(f) and (i)
of the Regulations. This Section 5.01(c)(i) is intended to comply with the
minimum gain chargeback requirement in Section 1.704-2(f) of the Regulations
and shall be interpreted consistently therewith. Allocations pursuant to this
Section 5.01(c)(i) shall be

 



      
 

 



 

made in proportion to the respective amounts required to be allocated to each
Partner pursuant hereto.

 



 

(ii) _Partnership Minimum Gain Chargeback_. Except as otherwise provided in
Section 1.704-2(i)(4) of the Regulations or in Section 5.01(c)(i) hereof, if
there is a net decrease in Partnership Minimum Gain attributable to Partner
Nonrecourse Debt Minimum Gain during any fiscal year, each Partner who has a
share of the Partnership Minimum Gain attributable to such Partner Nonrecourse
Debt Minimum Gain, determined in accordance with Section 1.704-2(i)(5) of the
Regulations, shall be specially allocated items of Partnership income and gain
for such year (and, if necessary, subsequent years) in an amount equal to that
Partners share of the net decrease in the Partnership Minimum Gain
attributable to such Partner Nonrecourse Debt to the extent and in the manner
required by Section 1.704-2(i) of the Regulations. The items to be so
allocated shall be determined in accordance with Sections 1.704-2(i)(4) and
(j)(2) of the Regulations. This Section 5.01(c)(ii) is intended to comply with
the minimum gain chargeback requirement with respect to Partner Nonrecourse
Debt contained in Section 1.704-2(i) of the Regulations and shall be
interpreted consistently therewith. Allocations pursuant to this Section
5.01(c)(ii) shall be made in proportion to the respective amounts required to
be allocated to each Partner pursuant hereto.

 



 

(iii) _Qualified Income Offset_. If a Partner unexpectedly receives any
adjustments, allocations or distributions described in Sections
1.704-1(b)(2)(ii)(d)(4), (5) or (6) of the Regulations, and such Partner has
an Adjusted Capital Account Deficit, items of Partnership income (including
gross income) and gain shall be specially allocated, in accordance with
Section 1.704-1(b)(2)(ii)(d) of the Regulations, to such Partner in an amount
and manner sufficient to eliminate the Adjusted Capital Account Deficit as
quickly as possible as required by the Regulations. This Section 5.01(c)(iii)
is intended to constitute a "qualified income offset" under Section
1.704-1(b)(2)(ii)(d) of the Regulations and shall be interpreted consistently
therewith.

 



 

(iv) _Nonrecourse Deductions_. Nonrecourse Deductions for any fiscal year or
other applicable period shall be allocated to the Partners in accordance with
their respective Percentage Interests.

 



 

(v) _Partner Nonrecourse Deductions_. Partner Nonrecourse Deductions for any
fiscal year or other applicable period with respect to a Partner Nonrecourse
Debt shall be specially allocated to the Partner that bears the economic risk
of loss for such Partner Nonrecourse Debt (as determined under Sections
1.704-2(b)(4) and 1.704-2(i)(1) of the Regulations)

 



 

(vi) _Section 754 Adjustment_. To the extent an adjustment to the adjusted tax
basis of any asset of the Partnership pursuant to Section 734(b) of the Code
or Section 743(b) of the Code is required, pursuant to Section
1.704-1(b)(2)(iv)(m) of the Regulations, to be taken into account in
determining Capital

 



      
 

 



 

Accounts, the amount of such adjustment to the Capital Accounts shall be
treated as an item of gain (if the adjustment increases the basis of the
asset) or loss (if the adjustment decreases such basis) and such gain or loss
shall be specially allocated among the Partners in a manner consistent with
the manner in which each of their respective Capital Accounts are required to
be adjusted pursuant to such section of the Regulations.

 



 

(vii) _Capital Account Deficits_. If any Partner has an Adjusted Capital
Account Deficit at the end of any fiscal year or other applicable period, such
Partner shall be specially allocated items of Partnership income and gain in
the amount of such excess as quickly as possible, provided that an allocation
pursuant to this Section 5.01(c)(vii) shall be made only if and to the extent
that such Partner would have an Adjusted Capital Account Deficit in excess of
such amount after all other allocations provided for under this Agreement have
been made as if Section 5.01(c)(iii) and this Section 5.01(c)(vii) were not in
this Agreement.

 



 

(viii) _Curative Allocations_. The allocations set forth in Sections
5.01(c)(i), (ii), (iii), (iv), (v), (vi) and (vii) hereof (the " **Regulatory
Allocations** ") are intended to comply with certain regulatory requirements,
including the requirements of Sections 1.704-1(b) and 1.704-2 of the
Regulations. Notwithstanding the provisions of Sections 5.01(a) and 5.01(b)
hereof, the Regulatory Allocations shall be taken into account in allocating
other items of income, gain, loss and deduction among the Partners so that to
the extent possible without violating the requirements giving rise to the
Regulatory Allocations, the net amount of such allocations of other items and
the Regulatory Allocations to each Partner shall be equal to the net amount
that would have been allocated to each such Partner if the Regulatory
Allocations had not occurred.

 



 

(d) _Special Allocation of Liquidating Gain and Net Property Gain_. After
giving effect to the special allocations in Section 5.01(c) but prior to the
allocations set forth in Section 5.01(a) and (b), Liquidating Gain, and
starting with the first January after the fifth anniversary of the Effective
Date, Net Property Gain shall be allocated to AREP in respect of its Class A
Common Units until AREP has a Capital Account balance of $13 million.

 



 

(e) _Allocations Between Transferor and Transferee_. If a Partner transfers
any part or all of its Partnership Interest, the distributive shares of the
various items of Net Income and Net Loss allocable among the Partners during
such fiscal year of the Partnership shall be allocated between the transferor
and the transferee Partner either (i) as if the Partnerships fiscal year had
ended on the date of the transfer or (ii) based on the number of days of such
fiscal year that each was a Partner without regard to the results of
Partnership activities in the respective portions of such fiscal year in which
the transferor and the transferee were Partners. The General Partner, in its
sole and absolute discretion, shall determine which method shall be used to
allocate the distributive shares of the various items of Net Income and Net
Loss between the transferor and the transferee Partner.

 



      
 

 



 

(f) _Tax Allocations_.

 



 

(i) _Items of Income or Loss_. Except as is otherwise provided in this Section
5.01, an allocation of Partnership Net Income, Net Loss, Liquidating Gain or
Net Property Gain to a Partner shall be treated as an allocation to such
Partner of the same share of each item of income, gain, loss, deduction and
item of tax-exempt income or Section 705(a)(2)(B) expenditure (or item treated
as such expenditure pursuant to Section 1.704-1(b)(2)(iv)(i) of the
Regulations) (" **Tax Items** ") that is taken into account in computing Net
Income, Net Loss, Liquidating Gain or Net Property Gain.

 



 

(ii) _Section 1245/1250 Recapture_. Subject to Section 5.01(f)(iii) below, if
any portion of gain from the sale of Partnership assets is treated as gain
which is ordinary income by virtue of the application of Sections 1245 or 1250
of the Code (" **Affected Gain** "), then such Affected Gain shall be
allocated among the Partners in the same proportion that the depreciation and
amortization deductions giving rise to the Affected Gain were allocated. This
Section 5.01(f)(ii) shall not alter the amount of Net Income, Liquidating Gain
or Net Property Gain (or items thereof) allocated among the Partners, but
merely the character of such Net Income, Liquidating Gain or Net Property Gain
(or items thereof). For purposes hereof, in order to determine the
proportionate allocations of depreciation and amortization deductions for each
fiscal year or other applicable period, such deductions shall be deemed
allocated on the same basis as Net Income, Net Loss, Liquidating Gain and Net
Property Gain for such respective period.

 



 

(iii) _Precontribution Gain, Revaluations_. With respect to any Contributed
Property, the Partnership shall use the traditional method contained in the
Regulations promulgated under Section 704(c) of the Code, in its sole
discretion, to take into account any variation between the adjusted basis of
such asset and the fair market value of such asset as of the time of the
contribution (" **Precontribution Gain** "). Each Partner hereby agrees to
report income, gain, loss and deduction on such Partners federal income tax
return in a manner consistent with the method used by the Partnership. If any
asset has a Gross Asset Value which is different from the Partnerships
adjusted basis for such asset for federal income tax purposes because the
Partnership has revalued such asset pursuant to Section 1.704-1(b)(2)(iv)(f)
of the Regulations, the allocations of Tax Items shall be made in accordance
with the principles of Section 704(c) of the Code and the Regulations and the
methods of allocation promulgated thereunder. The intent of this Section
5.01(f)(iii) is that each Partner who contributed to the capital of the
Partnership a Contributed Property will bear, through reduced allocations of
depreciation, increased allocations of gain or other items, the tax detriments
associated with any Precontribution Gain. This Section 5.01(f)(iii) is to be
interpreted consistently with such intent.

 



 

(iv) _Excess Nonrecourse Liability Safe Harbor_. Pursuant to Section
1.752-3(a)(3) of the Regulations, solely for purposes of determining each
Partners proportionate share of the "excess nonrecourse liabilities" of the
Partnership (as defined in Section 1.752-3(a)(3) of the Regulations), the
Partners

 



      
 

 



 

respective interests in Partnership profits shall be determined under any
permissible method reasonably determined by the General Partner; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that each Partner who has contributed an asset to the Partnership
shall be allocated, to the extent possible, a share of "excess nonrecourse
liabilities" of the Partnership which results in such Partner being allocated
nonrecourse liabilities in an amount which is at least equal to the amount of
income pursuant to Section 704(c) of the Code and the Regulations promulgated
thereunder (the " **Liability Shortfall** "). If there is an insufficient
amount of nonrecourse liabilities to be able to allocate to each Partner
nonrecourse liabilities equal to the Liability Shortfall, nonrecourse
liabilities shall be allocated to each Partner in pro rata in accordance with
each such Partners Liability Shortfall.

 



 

 **5.02** ** ****_Distribution of Cash_**.

 



 

(a) _Distributions Generally_. Subject to the other provisions of this Section
5.02 and to the provisions of Section 5.06 hereof, the Partnership shall
distribute cash at such times and in such amounts as are, subject to the terms
and conditions of this Agreement, determined by the General Partner in its
sole and absolute discretion, to the Partners who are Partners on the
Partnership Record Date with respect to such month (or other distribution
period) on the Partnership Record Date in the following order of priority:

 



 

(i) first, to the holders of Preferred Units in accordance with each such
holders Preferred Return Per Preferred Unit with respect to all Preferred
Units held by such holder, less that aggregate amount previously distributed
with respect to such holders Preferred Units pursuant to this Section
5.02(a)(i);

 



 

(ii) Second, to the holders of Class A Common Units in accordance with each
such holders Preferred Return Per Class A Unit with respect to all Class A
Common Units held by such holder, less the aggregate amount previously
distributed with respect to such holders Class A Common Units pursuant to
this Section 5.02(a)(ii); and

 



 

(iii) Third, to the holders of Class B Common Units in proportion to the total
number of Partnership Units held by them on the Partnership Record Date.

 



 

(b) _Reserved_.

 



 

(c) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, the General Partner
is authorized to take any action that it determines to be necessary or
appropriate to cause the Partnership to comply with any withholding
requirements established under the Code or any other federal, state or local
law including, without limitation, pursuant to Sections 1441, 1442, 1445 and
1446 of the Code. To the extent that the Partnership is required to withhold
and pay over to any taxing authority any amount resulting from the allocation
or distribution of income to a Partner or assignee (including by reason of
Section 1446 of the Code), either (i) if the actual amount to be distributed
to the Partner (the " **Distributable Amount** ") equals or exceeds the
Withheld Amount, the entire Distributable Amount shall be treated as a
distribution of cash to such Partner, or (ii) if the Distributable Amount is
less than the Withheld Amount, the excess of

 



      
 

 



 

the Withheld Amount over the Distributable Amount shall be treated as a
Partnership Loan from the Partnership to the Partner on the day the
Partnership pays over such amount to a taxing authority. A Partner shall repay
a Partnership Loan upon the demand of the Partnership or, alternatively,
through withholding by the Partnership with respect to subsequent
distributions to the applicable Partner or assignee. In the event that a
Limited Partner fails to pay any amount owed to the Partnership with respect
to the Partnership Loan within 15 days after demand for payment thereof is
made by the Partnership on the Limited Partner, the General Partner, in its
sole and absolute discretion, may elect to make the payment to the Partnership
on behalf of such Defaulting Limited Partner. In such event, on the date of
payment, the General Partner shall be deemed to have extended a General
Partner Loan to the Defaulting Limited Partner in the amount of the payment
made by the General Partner and the General Partner shall succeed to all
rights and remedies of the Partnership against the Defaulting Limited Partner
as to that amount. Without limitation, the General Partner shall have the
right to receive any distributions that otherwise would be made by the
Partnership to the Defaulting Limited Partner until such time as the General
Partner Loan has been paid in full, and any such distributions so received by
the General Partner shall be treated as having been received by the Defaulting
Limited Partner and immediately paid to the General Partner.

 



 

Any amounts treated as a Partnership Loan or a General Partner Loan pursuant
to this Section 5.02(c) shall bear interest at the lesser of (i) 300 basis
points above the base rate on corporate loans at large United States money
center commercial banks, as published from time to time in _The Wall Street
Journal_ , or (ii) the maximum lawful rate of interest on such obligation,
such interest to accrue from the date the Partnership or the General Partner,
as applicable, is deemed to extend the loan until such loan is repaid in full.

 



 

(d) In no event may a Partner receive a distribution of cash with respect to a
Partnership Unit if such Partner is entitled to receive a cash dividend as the
holder of record of a REIT Share for which all or part of such Partnership
Unit has been or will be redeemed.

 



 

 **5.03** ** ****_Reserved_**.

 



 

 **5.04** ** ****_No Right to Distributions in Kind_**. No Partner shall be
entitled to demand property other than cash in connection with any
distributions by the Partnership. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in
this Agreement, the General Partner shall have the right to make distributions
in kind to the General Partner.

 



 

 **5.05** ** ****_Limitations on Distributions_**. Notwithstanding any of the
provisions of this Agreement, no Partner shall have the right to receive, and
the Partnership and the General Partner shall not have the right to make, a
distribution that violates the Act or other applicable law.

 



 

 **5.06** ** ****_Distributions Upon Liquidation_**.

 



 

(a) Upon liquidation of the Partnership any remaining assets of the
Partnership shall be distributed in the following order:

 



 

(i) First, to the payment and discharge of all of the Partnerships debts and
liabilities to creditors other than the Partners;

 



      
 

 



 

(ii) Second, to the payment and discharge of all of the Partnerships debts
and liabilities to the other Partners; and

 



 

(iii) The balance to all Partners with positive Capital Accounts pro rata in
accordance with their respective positive Capital Account balances.

 



 

(b) For purposes of Section 5.06(a) hereof, the Capital Account of each
Partner shall be determined after making all adjustments in accordance with
Sections 5.01 and 5.02 hereof resulting from Partnership operations and from
all sales and dispositions of all or any part of the Partnerships assets.

 



 

(c) Any distributions pursuant to this Section 5.06 shall be made within a
reasonable time as determined by the General Partner in its sole discretion.
To the extent deemed advisable by the General Partner, appropriate
arrangements (including the use of a liquidating trust) may be made to assure
that adequate funds are available to satisfy any contingent debts or
obligations of the Partnership.

 



 

(d) If the Partnership is liquidated within the meaning of Section
1.704-1(b)(2)(ii)(g) of the Regulations, (i) distributions shall be made to
the Partners who have positive Capital Accounts in compliance with Section
1.704-1(b)(2)(ii)(b)(2) of the Regulations, (ii) if the Initial Limited
Partners Capital Account has a deficit balance (after giving effect to all
contributions, distributions and allocations for all taxable years, including
the year during with such liquidation occurs), such Initial Limited Partner
shall restore and contribute to the capital of the Partnership the amount
necessary to restore such deficit balance to zero, but not to exceed $[ * ](3)
in compliance with Section 1.704-1(b)(2)(ii)(b)(3) of the Regulations and
(iii) if AREPs Capital Account has a deficit balance (after giving effect to
all contributions, distributions and allocations for all taxable years,
including the year during with such liquidation occurs), AREP shall restore
and contribute to the capital of the Partnership the amount necessary to
restore such deficit balance to zero but not to exceed the Partnerships
deduction attributable to the subordinated incentive listing fee (the amount
of such fee to be equal to the principal amount of the Subordinated Incentive
Listing Note), which restoration and contribution shall be before the later to
occur of (x) the end of the taxable year in which the Partnership (or such
Limited Partners interest) is liquidated, or (y) ninety (90) days after the
date of the liquidation of the Partnership (or such Limited Partners
interest), which amount shall be paid to creditors of the Partnership or, if
the amount contributed exceeds the amount due to creditors, shall be
distributed to the Partners with positive Capital Account balances. If any
Partner (other than AREP) has a deficit balance in his Capital Account (after
giving effect to all contributions, distributions and allocations for all
taxable years, including the year during with such liquidation occurs), such
Partner shall have no obligation to make any contribution to the capital of
the Partnership with respect to such deficit, and such deficit shall not be
considered a debt owed to the Partnership or to any other Person for any
purpose whatsoever. Consistent with Section 1.704-1(b)(2)(iv)(l) of the
Regulations, a termination of the Partnership pursuant to Section 708(b)(1)(B)
of the Code shall not result in a liquidation of the Partnership for purposes
of this Section 5.06(d).

  (3) _Remaining DRO obligation to be obtained from the Partnership s
accountants._

 



      
 

 



 

 **5.07** ** ****_Substantial Economic Effect_**. It is the intent of the
Partners that the allocations of Net Income and Net Loss under the Agreement
have "substantial economic effect" (or be consistent with the Partners
interests in the Partnership in the case of the allocation of losses
attributable to nonrecourse debt) within the meaning of Section 704(b) of the
Code as interpreted by the Regulations promulgated pursuant thereto. Article V
and other relevant provisions of this Agreement shall be interpreted in a
manner consistent with such intent.

(xxiii) to take such other action, execute, acknowledge, swear to or deliver

the Company or the General Partner deems necessary or appropriate such that
the Company shall continue to satisfy the requirements for qualification as a
REIT under the Code and Regulations (" **REIT Requirements** ") and avoid any
federal income or excise tax liability; _provided_ , _however_ , the General
Partner shall not be bound to comply with this covenant to the extent any
distributions required to be made in order to satisfy the REIT Requirements
would violate the Act or other applicable law or contravene the terms of any
notes, mortgages or other types of debt obligations to which the Partnership
may be subject in conjunction with borrowed funds.

 



      
 

 



 

(b) Except as otherwise provided herein or in the Act, to the extent the
duties of the General Partner require expenditures of funds to be paid to
third parties, the General Partner shall not have any obligations hereunder
except to the extent that Partnership funds are reasonably available to it for
the performance of such duties, and nothing herein contained shall be deemed
to authorize or require the General Partner, in its capacity as such, to
expend its individual funds for payment to third parties or to undertake any
individual liability or obligation on behalf of the Partnership.

 



 

 **6.02** ** ****_Delegation of Authority_**. The General Partner may delegate
any or all of its powers, rights and obligations hereunder, and may appoint,
employ, contract or otherwise deal with any Person for the transaction of the
business of the Partnership, which Person may, under supervision of the
General Partner, perform any acts or services for the Partnership as the
General Partner may approve.

 



 

 **6.03** ** ****_Indemnification and Exculpation of Indemnitees_**.

 



 

(a) To the fullest extent permitted by law, the Partnership shall indemnify an
Indemnitee from and against any and all losses, claims, damages, liabilities,
joint or several, expenses (including reasonable legal fees and expenses),
judgments, fines, settlements, and other amounts arising from any and all
claims, demands, actions, suits or proceedings, civil, criminal,
administrative or investigative, that relate to the operations of the
Partnership as set forth in this Agreement in which any Indemnitee may be
involved, or is threatened to be involved, as a party or otherwise, unless it
is established that: (i) the act or omission of the Indemnitee was material to
the matter giving rise to the proceeding and either was committed in bad faith
or was the result of active and deliberate dishonesty; (ii) the Indemnitee
actually received an improper personal benefit in money, property or services;
or (iii) in the case of any criminal proceeding, the Indemnitee had reasonable
cause to believe that the act or omission was unlawful. The parties hereto
agree, that the termination of any proceeding by judgment, order or settlement
does not create a presumption that the Indemnitee did not meet the requisite
standard of conduct set forth in this Section 6.03(a). The parties hereto
agree, that the termination of any proceeding by conviction or upon a plea of
nolo contendere or its equivalent, or an entry of an order of probation prior
to judgment, creates a rebuttable presumption that the Indemnitee acted in a
manner contrary to that specified in this Section 6.03(a). Any indemnification
pursuant to this Section 6.03 shall be made only out of the assets of the
Partnership.

 



 

(b) The Partnership shall reimburse an Indemnitee for reasonable expenses
incurred by an Indemnitee who is a party to a proceeding in advance of the
final disposition of the proceeding upon receipt by the Partnership of (i) a
written affirmation by the Indemnitee of the Indemnitees good faith belief
that the standard of conduct necessary for indemnification by the Partnership
as authorized in this Section 6.03 has been met, and (ii) a written
undertaking by or on behalf of the Indemnitee to repay the amount if it shall
ultimately be determined that the standard of conduct has not been met.

 



 

(c) The indemnification provided by this Section 6.03 shall be in addition to
any other rights to which an Indemnitee or any other Person may be entitled
under any agreement, pursuant to any vote of the Partners, as a matter of law
or otherwise, and shall continue as to an Indemnitee who has ceased to serve
in such capacity.

 



       
 

 



 

(d) The Partnership may purchase and maintain insurance, as an expense of the
Partnership, on behalf of the Indemnitees and such other Persons as the
General Partner shall determine, against any liability that may be asserted
against or expenses that may be incurred by such Person in connection with the
Partnerships activities, regardless of whether the Partnership would have the
power to indemnify such Person against such liability under the provisions of
this Agreement.

 



 

(e) For purposes of this Section 6.03, the Partnership shall be deemed to have
requested an Indemnitee to serve as fiduciary of an employee benefit plan
whenever the performance by it of its duties to the Partnership also imposes
duties on, or otherwise involves services by, it to the plan or participants
or beneficiaries of the plan; excise taxes assessed on an Indemnitee with
respect to an employee benefit plan pursuant to applicable law shall
constitute fines within the meaning of this Section 6.03; and actions taken or
omitted by the Indemnitee with respect to an employee benefit plan in the
performance of its duties for a purpose reasonably believed by it to be in the
interest of the participants and beneficiaries of the plan shall be deemed to
be for a purpose that is not opposed to the best interests of the Partnership.

 



 

(f) In no event may an Indemnitee subject the Limited Partners to personal
liability by reason of the indemnification provisions set forth in this
Agreement.

 



 

(g) An Indemnitee shall not be denied indemnification in whole or in part
under this Section 6.03 because the Indemnitee had an interest in the
transaction with respect to which the indemnification applies if the
transaction was otherwise permitted by the terms of this Agreement.

 



 

(h) The provisions of this Section 6.03 are for the benefit of the
Indemnitees, their heirs, successors, assigns and administrators and shall not
be deemed to create any rights for the benefit of any other Persons.

 



 

(i) Any amendment, modification or repeal of this Section 6.03 or any
provision hereof shall be prospective only and shall not in any way affect the
indemnification of an Indemnitee by the Partnership under this Section 6.03 as
in effect immediately prior to such amendment, modification or repeal with
respect to matters occurring, in whole or in part, prior to such amendment,
modification or repeal, regardless of when claims relating to such matters may
arise or be asserted.

 



 

 **6.04 _Liability of the General Partner_**.

 



 

(a) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement, no
Indemnitee shall be liable for monetary damages to the Partnership or any
Partners for losses sustained or liabilities incurred as a result of errors in
judgment or mistakes of fact or law or of any act or omission if any such
party acted in good faith. Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement or
otherwise applicable provision of law or equity, the General Partner shall not
be in breach of any duty (fiduciary or otherwise) that the General Partner may
owe to the Limited Partners or the Partnership or any other Persons bound by
this Agreement provided the General Partner, acting in good faith, abides by
the terms of this Agreement.

 



      
 

 



 

(b) Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement or otherwise applicable
provision of law or equity, the Limited Partners expressly acknowledge that
the General Partner is acting for the benefit of the Partnership, the Limited
Partners and the Companys stockholders collectively, and that, to the fullest
extent permitted by law, the General Partner has no duty (fiduciary or
otherwise) and is under no obligation to consider the separate interests of
the Limited Partners (including, without limitation, the tax consequences to
Limited Partners or the tax consequences of some, but not all, of the Limited
Partners) in deciding whether to cause the Partnership to take (or decline to
take) any actions. In the event of a conflict between the interests of the
stockholders of the Company on the one hand and the Limited Partners on the
other, the General Partner shall endeavor in good faith to resolve the
conflict in a manner not adverse to either the stockholders of the Company or
the Limited Partners; _provided_ , _however_ , that for so long as the General
Partner owns a controlling interest in the Partnership, any such conflict that
the General Partner, in its sole and absolute discretion, determines cannot be
resolved in a manner not adverse to either the stockholders of the Company or
the Limited Partners shall be resolved in favor of the stockholders of the
Company. The General Partner shall not be liable to the Partners or the
Partnership for monetary damages for losses sustained, liabilities incurred or
benefits not derived by the Limited Partners or the Partnership in connection
with such decisions.

 



 

(c) Subject to its obligations and duties as General Partner set forth in
Section 6.01 hereof, the General Partner may exercise any of the powers
granted to it under this Agreement and perform any of the duties imposed upon
it hereunder either directly or by or through its agents. The General Partner
shall not be responsible or liable to the Limited Partners or the Partnership
for any misconduct or negligence on the part of any such agent appointed by it
in good faith.

 



 

(d) Notwithstanding any other provisions of this Agreement or the Act, any
action of the General Partner on behalf of the Partnership or any decision of
the General Partner to refrain from acting on behalf of the Partnership,
undertaken in the good faith belief that such action or omission is necessary
or advisable in order (i) to protect the ability of the Company to continue to
qualify as a REIT or (ii) to prevent the Company from incurring any taxes
under Section 857, Section 4981 or any other provision of the Code, is
expressly authorized under this Agreement and is deemed approved by all of the
Limited Partners.

 



 

(e) Any amendment, modification or repeal of this Section 6.04 or any
provision hereof shall be prospective only and shall not in any way affect the
limitations on the General Partners or any of its officers, directors,
agents or employees liability to the Partnership and the Limited Partners
under this Section 6.04 as in effect immediately prior to such amendment,
modification or repeal with respect to matters occurring, in whole or in part,
prior to such amendment, modification or repeal, regardless of when claims
relating to such matters may arise or be asserted.

 



 

 **6.05 _Partnership Obligations_**.

 



 

(a) Except as provided in this Section 6.05 and elsewhere in this Agreement
(including the provisions of Articles V and VI hereof regarding distributions,
payments and

 



      
 

 



 

allocations to which it may be entitled), the General Partner shall not be
compensated for its services as general partner of the Partnership.

 



 

(b) All Administrative Expenses shall be obligations of the Partnership, and
the General Partner and the Company shall be entitled to reimbursement by the
Partnership for any expenditure (including Administrative Expenses) incurred
on behalf of the Partnership that shall be made other than out of the funds of
the Partnership.

 



 

 **6.06 _Outside Activities_**. Subject to Section 6.08 hereof, the Charter
and any agreements entered into by the General Partner, the Company or any of
their respective Affiliates with the Partnership or a Subsidiary, any officer,
director, employee, agent, trustee, Affiliate or stockholders of the Company,
the General Partner and the Company shall be entitled to and may have business
interests and engage in business activities in addition to those relating to
the Partnership, including business interests and activities substantially
similar or identical to those of the Partnership, and the doctrine of
corporate opportunity or any analogous doctrine shall not apply to such
business interest or activities. Neither the Partnership nor any of the
Limited Partners shall have any rights by virtue of this Agreement in any such
business ventures, interest or activities. None of the Limited Partners nor
any other Person bound by this Agreement shall have any rights by virtue of
this Agreement or the partnership relationship established hereby in any such
business ventures, interests or activities, and the General Partner and the
Company, (i) shall have no duty or obligation (fiduciary or otherwise)
pursuant to this Agreement to offer any interest in any such business
ventures, interests and activities to the Partnership or any Limited Partner,
even if such opportunity is of a character that, if presented to the
Partnership or any Limited Partner, could be taken by such Person, and (ii)
shall not be liable to the Partnership or to the Limited Partners for breach
of any fiduciary or other duty existing at law, in equity or otherwise by
reason of the fact that the General Partner or the Company pursues or acquires
for, or directs such business ventures, interests or activities to another
Person or does not communicate such opportunity or information to the
Partnership.

 



 

 **6.07 _Employment or Retention of Affiliates_**.

 



 

(a) Any Affiliate of the General Partner may be employed or retained by the
Partnership and may otherwise deal with the Partnership (whether as a buyer,
lessor, lessee, manager, furnisher of goods or services, broker, agent, lender
or otherwise) and may receive from the Partnership any compensation, price or
other payment therefor that the General Partner determines to be fair and
reasonable.

 



 

(b) The Partnership may lend or contribute to its Subsidiaries or other
Persons in which it has an equity investment, and such Persons may borrow
funds from the Partnership, on terms and conditions established in the sole
and absolute discretion of the General Partner. The foregoing authority shall
not create any right or benefit in favor of any Subsidiary or any other
Person.

 



 

(c) The Partnership may transfer assets to joint ventures, other partnerships,
corporations or other business entities in which it is or thereby becomes a
participant upon such terms and subject to such conditions as the General
Partner deems are consistent with this Agreement and applicable law.

 



      
 

 



 

 **6.08 _Company and General Partner Activities_**. Consistent with Section
6.06, the Limited Partners understand and agree that, generally, all business
activities of the General Partner and the Company, including activities
pertaining to the acquisition, development, ownership of or investment in
single tenant freestanding commercial real estate and related assets, have not
been and will not be conducted through the Partnership or one or more
Subsidiary Partnerships.

 



 

 **6.09 _Title to Partnership Assets_**. Title to Partnership assets, whether
real, personal or mixed and whether tangible or intangible, shall be deemed to
be owned by the Partnership as an entity, and no Partner, individually or
collectively, shall have any ownership interest in such Partnership assets or
any portion thereof. Title to any or all of the Partnership assets may be held
in the name of the Partnership, the General Partner or one or more nominees,
as the General Partner may determine, including Affiliates of the General
Partner. The General Partner hereby declares and warrants that any Partnership
assets for which legal title is held in the name of the General Partner or any
nominee or Affiliate of the General Partner shall be held by the General
Partner for the use and benefit of the Partnership in accordance with the
provisions of this Agreement; _provided_ , _however_ , that the General
Partner shall use its best efforts to cause beneficial and record title to
such assets to be vested in the Partnership as soon as reasonably practicable.
All Partnership assets shall be recorded as the property of the Partnership in
its books and records, irrespective of the name in which legal title to such
Partnership assets is held.

 



 

 **ARTICLE VII. _ 
CHANGES IN THE COMPANY OR THE GENERAL PARTNER_**

 



 

 **7.01 _Transfer of the General Partner s Partnership Interest_**.

 



 

(a) The General Partner shall not transfer all or any portion of its General
Partner Interests, and the General Partner shall not withdraw as General
Partner, except as provided in or in connection with a transaction
contemplated by Section 7.01(c) hereof.

 



 

(b) The General Partner agrees that its General Partner Interest will at all
times be in the aggregate at least 0.1% of the Partnership Interests.

 



 

(c) Notwithstanding anything in this Section 7.01, the General Partner may
transfer all or any portion of its General Partner Interest to the Company or
any wholly owned Subsidiary of the Company, and following a transfer of all of
its General Partner Interest, may withdraw as General Partner. In the event
that the General Partner transfers its entire General Partner Interest and the
transferee is admitted to the Partnership as a substitute General Partner in
accordance with this Agreement, such transferee shall be deemed admitted to
the Partnership as a General Partner immediately prior to the transfer and
such transferee shall continue the business of the Partnership without
dissolution.

 



 

 **7.02 _Merger of Company_**.

 



 

(a) Except as otherwise provided in Section 7.02(b) or (c) hereof, the Company
shall not engage in any merger, consolidation or other combination with or
into another Person or sale of all or substantially all of its assets (other
than in connection with a change in the Companys state of incorporation or
organizational form), in each case which

 



      
 

 



 

results in a Change of Control of the Company (a " **Transaction** "), unless
at least one of the following conditions is met:

 



 

(i) the Consent of the Class A Limited Partners is obtained;

 



 

(ii) as a result of such Transaction, (x) all Limited Partners holding Class A
Common Units will receive, or have the right to receive, for each such Class A
Common Unit held by such Limited Partners an amount of cash, securities or
other property equal in value to the product of the Conversion Factor and the
greatest amount of cash, securities or other property paid in the Transaction
to a holder of one REIT Share in consideration of one REIT Share, _provided_
that if, in connection with such Transaction, a purchase, tender or exchange
offer (" **Offer** ") shall have been made to and accepted by the holders of
more than 50% of the outstanding REIT Shares, each holder of Class A Common
Units (other than the General Partner and any Subsidiary of the General
Partner) shall be given the option to exchange its Class A Common Units for
the greatest amount of cash, securities or other property that such Limited
Partner would have received had it (A) exercised its Common Unit Redemption
Right pursuant to Section 8.04 hereof and (B) sold, tendered or exchanged
pursuant to the Offer the REIT Shares received upon exercise of the Common
Unit Redemption Right immediately prior to the expiration of the Offer and (y)
all Limited Partners holding Preferred Units have the option of receiving per
Preferred Unit a cash amount equal to the Preferred Cash Amount; or

 



 

(iii) the General Partner or the Company is the surviving entity in the
Transaction and (x) either (A) the holders of REIT Shares do not receive cash,
securities or other property in the Transaction or (B) all Limited Partners
holding Class A Common Units receive for each Class A Common Unit held by such
Limited Partners an amount of cash, securities or other property (expressed as
an amount per REIT Share) that is no less in value than the product of the
Conversion Factor and the greatest amount of cash, securities or other
property (expressed as an amount per REIT Share) received in the Transaction
by any holder of REIT Shares and (y) all Limited Partners holding Preferred
Units have the option of receiving per Preferred Unit a cash amount equal to
the Preferred Cash Amount.

 



 

(b) Notwithstanding Section 7.02(a) hereof, the General Partner or the Company
may merge with or into or consolidate with another entity, or sell
substantially all of its assets to another entity, if immediately after such
merger, consolidation or sale, the surviving or acquiring entity (the "
**Survivor** ") expressly agrees to assume all obligations of the General
Partner and the Company hereunder. Notwithstanding any provision of this
Agreement and without the consent of any other person, upon such assumption,
(i) for all purposes of this Agreement, if the General Partner or the Company
is not the Survivor, the Survivor, shall be deemed to be the "General Partner"
hereunder and shall be deemed to be admitted as the general partner of the
Partnership, upon its execution of a counterpart to this Agreement, effective
simultaneously with the merger or consolidation, (ii) the Survivor shall
continue the business of the Partnership without dissolution, and (iii) the
Survivor shall have the right and duty to amend

 



      
 

 



 

this Agreement as set forth in this Section 7.02(b) or in any other manner, if
applicable, to reflect the change in the general partner of the Partnership.
The Survivor shall in good faith arrive at a new method for the calculation of
the Common Cash Amount, the Common REIT Shares Amount and Conversion Factor
for a Class A Common Unit after any such merger or consolidation so as to
approximate the existing method for such calculation as closely as reasonably
possible. Such calculation shall take into account, among other things, the
kind and amount of securities, cash and other property that was receivable
upon such merger or consolidation by a holder of REIT Shares or options,
warrants or other rights relating thereto, and which a holder of Class A
Common Units could have acquired had such Class A Common Units been exchanged
immediately prior to such merger or consolidation. Such amendment to this
Agreement shall provide for adjustment to such method of calculation, which
shall be as nearly equivalent as may be practicable to the adjustments
provided for with respect to the Conversion Factor. The Survivor also shall in
good faith modify the definition of REIT Shares and make such amendments to
Section 8.04 or Section 8.05 hereof so as to approximate the existing rights
and obligations set forth in Section 8.04 or Section 8.05 hereof as closely as
reasonably possible. The above provisions of this Section 7.02(b) shall
similarly apply to successive mergers or consolidations permitted hereunder.

 



 

Notwithstanding anything in this Section 7.02, the General Partner or the
Company may engage in a transaction required by law or by the rules of any
national securities exchange or over-the-counter interdealer quotation system
on which the REIT Shares are listed or traded.

 



 

 **7.03 _Admission of a Substitute or Additional General Partner_**. A Person
shall be admitted as a substitute or additional General Partner of the
Partnership only if the following terms and conditions are satisfied:

 



 

(a) the Person to be admitted as a substitute or additional General Partner
shall have accepted and agreed to be bound by all the terms and provisions of
this Agreement by executing a counterpart hereof, and an amendment to the
Certificate of Limited Partnership of the Partnership evidencing the admission
of such Person as a General Partner shall have been filed with the office of
the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware;

 



 

(b) if the Person to be admitted as a substitute or additional General Partner
is a corporation or a partnership, it shall have provided the Partnership with
evidence satisfactory to counsel for the Partnership of such Persons
authority to become a General Partner and to be bound by the terms and
provisions of this Agreement; and

 



 

(c) counsel for the Partnership shall have rendered an opinion (relying on
such opinions from other counsel as may be necessary) that the admission of
the Person to be admitted as a substitute or additional General Partner is in
conformity with the Act, that none of the actions taken in connection with the
admission of such Person as a substitute or additional General Partner will
cause (i) the Partnership to be classified other than as a partnership for
federal income tax purposes, or (ii) the loss of any Limited Partners limited
liability.

 



      
 

 



 

 **7.04 _Effect of Bankruptcy, Withdrawal, Death or Dissolution of General
Partner_**.

 



 

(a) Upon the occurrence of an Event of Bankruptcy as to the General Partner
(and its removal pursuant to Section 7.05(a) hereof) or the withdrawal,
removal or dissolution of the General Partner or any other event that results
in the General Partner ceasing to be a general partner of the Partnership
under the Act, the Partnership shall be dissolved and its affairs wound up
unless the business of the Partnership is continued pursuant to Section
7.04(b) hereof. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary,
any successor to the General Partner by merger or consolidation in compliance
with Section 7.02(b) shall, without further act of any Person, be the General
Partner hereunder, and such merger or consolidation shall not constitute a
transfer for purposes of this Agreement and the Partnership shall continue
without dissolution.

 



 

(b) Following the occurrence of an Event of Bankruptcy as to the General
Partner (and its removal pursuant to Section 7.05(a) hereof) or the
withdrawal, removal or dissolution of the General Partner or any other event
that resulting the General Partner ceasing to be a general partner of the
Partnership under the Act, the Partnership shall not be dissolved or wound up
if the Limited Partners, within 90 days after such occurrence, elect to
continue the business of the Partnership for the balance of the term specified
in Section 2.04 hereof by selecting effective as of such occurrence, subject
to Section 7.03 hereof in writing or vote, a substitute General Partner by the
Consent of the Class A Limited Partners. Any substitute General Partner
selected by the Limited Partners in accordance with this Section 7.05(b) and
admitted to the Partnership in accordance with Section 7.03, shall be deemed
admitted to the Partnership effective simultaneously with the occurrence of
the event that caused the General Partner to cease to be a general partner of
the Partnership. If the Limited Partners elect to continue the business of the
Partnership and admit a substitute General Partner, the relationship with the
Partners and of any Person who has acquired an interest of a Partner in the
Partnership shall be governed by this Agreement.

 



 

 **7.05 _Removal of General Partner_**.

 



 

(a) Upon the occurrence of an Event of Bankruptcy as to, or the dissolution
of, the General Partner, the General Partner shall be deemed to be removed
automatically. To the fullest extent permitted by law, the Limited Partners
may not remove the General Partner, with or without cause.

 



 

(b) If the General Partner has been removed pursuant to this Section 7.05 and
the Partnership is continued pursuant to Section 7.04 hereof, the General
Partner shall promptly transfer and assign its General Partner Interest in the
Partnership to the substitute General Partner approved by the Consent of the
Class A Limited Partners in accordance with Section 7.04(b) hereof and
otherwise be admitted to the Partnership in accordance with Section 7.03
hereof. At the time of assignment, the removed General Partner shall be
entitled to receive from the substitute General Partner the fair market value
of the General Partner Interest of such removed General Partner as reduced by
any damages caused to the Partnership by such General Partner. Such fair
market value shall be determined by an appraiser mutually agreed upon by the
General Partner and the Class A Limited Partners (exercised through the
Consent of the Class A Limited Partners) within ten days following the removal
of the General Partner. In the event that the parties are unable to agree upon
an appraiser, the removed General Partner and the Class A Limited Partners
(exercised through the Consent of the Class A Limited Partners) each shall
select an appraiser. Each such appraiser shall complete an appraisal of the
fair market value of

 



      
 

 



 

the removed General Partners General Partner Interest within 30 days of the
General Partners removal, and the fair market value of the removed General
Partners General Partner Interest shall be the average of the two appraisals;
_provided_ , _however_ , that if the higher appraisal exceeds the lower
appraisal by more than 20% of the amount of the lower appraisal, the two
appraisers, no later than 40 days after the removal of the General Partner,
shall select a third appraiser who shall complete an appraisal of the fair
market value of the removed General Partners General Partner Interest no
later than 60 days after the removal of the General Partner. In such case, the
fair market value of the removed General Partners General Partner Interest
shall be the average of the two appraisals closest in value.

 



 

(c) The General Partner Interest of a removed General Partner, during the time
after default until transfer under Section 7.05(b) hereof, shall be converted
to that of a special Limited Partner; _provided_ , _however_ , such removed
General Partner shall not have any rights to participate in the management and
affairs of the Partnership, and shall not be entitled to any portion of the
income, expense, profit, gain or loss allocations or cash distributions
allocable or payable, as the case may be, to the Limited Partners. Instead,
such removed General Partner shall receive and be entitled only to retain
distributions or allocations of such items that it would have been entitled to
receive in its capacity as General Partner, until the transfer is effective
pursuant to Section 7.05(b) hereof.

 



 

(d) All Partners shall have given and hereby do give such consents, shall take
such actions and shall execute such documents as shall be legally necessary
and sufficient to effect all the foregoing provisions of this Section 7.05.

 



 

 **ARTICLE VIII. _ 
RIGHTS AND OBLIGATIONS OF THE LIMITED PARTNERS_**

 



 

 **8.01 _Management of the Partnership_**. The Limited Partners shall not
participate in the management or control of Partnership business nor shall
they transact any business for the Partnership, nor shall they have the power
to sign for or bind the Partnership, such powers being vested solely and
exclusively in the General Partner. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
contained in this Agreement, none of the actions taken by any of the Limited
Partners hereunder shall constitute participation in the control of the
business of the Partnership within the meaning of the Act.

 



 

 **8.02 _Power of Attorney_**. Each Limited Partner hereby irrevocably
appoints the General Partner its true and lawful attorney-in-fact, who may act
for each Limited Partner and in its name, place and stead, and for its use and
benefit, to sign, acknowledge, swear to, deliver, file or record, at the
appropriate public offices, any and all documents, certificates and
instruments as may be deemed necessary or desirable by the General Partner to
carry out fully the provisions of this Agreement and the Act in accordance
with their terms, including duly adapted amendments hereto, which power of
attorney is coupled with an interest and shall survive and not be affected by
the subsequent death, dissolution or legal incapacity of the Limited Partner,
or the transfer by the Limited Partner of any part or all of its Partnership
Interest. This power of attorney may be exercised by such attorney-in-fact for
all Limited Partners (or any of them) by a single signature of the General
Partner acting as attorney-in-fact with or without listing all of the Limited
Partners executing an instrument.

 



      
 

 



 

 **8.03 _Limitation on Liability of Limited Partners_**. No Limited Partner,
in its capacity as such, shall be liable for any debts, liabilities, contracts
or obligations of the Partnership. Except as otherwise provided in this
Agreement or under the Act, a Limited Partner shall be liable to the
Partnership only to make payments of its Capital Contribution, if any, as and
when due hereunder. After its Capital Contribution is fully paid, no Limited
Partner shall, except as otherwise required by the Act or as otherwise
provided for herein, be required to make any further Capital Contributions or
other payments or lend any funds to the Partnership.

 



 

 **8.04 _Common Unit Redemption Right_**.

 



 

(a) Subject to Sections 8.04(b), (c), (d), (e) and (f) hereof and the
provisions of any agreements between the Partnership and one or more Limited
Partners with respect to Class A Common Units held by them, each holder of
Class A Common Units shall have the right (the " **Common Unit Redemption
Right** "), for a period of 90 days beginning 30 days after the Chargeback
Allocation has occurred in full (the " **Initial Common Put Window** ") or any
time beginning one year after the expiration of the Common Call Window if the
General Partner has not delivered a Call Notice pursuant to Section 8.06(a),
to require the Company to convert on a Specified Redemption Date all of the
Class A Common Units held by such Limited Partner at a redemption price equal
to and in the form of the Common Unit Redemption Amount to be paid by the
Company. The Common Unit Redemption Right shall be exercised pursuant to a
Notice of Exercise of Redemption Right in substantially the form attached
hereto as Exhibit B-1 delivered to the Company (with a copy to the General
Partner) by the Limited Partner who is exercising the Common Unit Redemption
Right (the " **Redeeming Common Limited Partner** "); _provided_ , _however_ ,
that the Company shall, in its sole and absolute discretion, have the option
to deliver either the Common Cash Amount or the Common REIT Shares Amount;
_provided_ , _further_ , that the Company shall not be obligated to satisfy
such Common Unit Redemption Right if the Company elects to purchase the Class
A Common Units subject to the Notice of Redemption. The Redeeming Common
Limited Partner shall have no right, with respect to any Class A Common Units
so redeemed, to receive any distribution paid with respect to Class A Common
Units if the record date for such distribution is on or after the Specified
Redemption Date.

 



 

(b) Notwithstanding the provisions of Section 8.04(a) hereof, a Limited
Partner that exercises the Common Unit Redemption Right shall be deemed to
have offered to sell the Class A Common Units described in the Notice of
Redemption to the Company, and the Company may, in its sole and absolute
discretion, elect to purchase directly and acquire such Class A Common Units
by paying to the Redeeming Common Limited Partner either the Common Cash
Amount or the Common REIT Shares Amount, as elected by the Company (in its
sole and absolute discretion), on the Specified Redemption Date, whereupon the
Company shall acquire the Class A Common Units offered for redemption by the
Redeeming Common Limited Partner and shall be treated for all purposes of this
Agreement as the owner of such Class A Common Units. If the Company shall
elect to exercise its right to purchase Class A Common Units under this
Section 8.04(b) with respect to a Notice of Redemption, it shall so notify the
Redeeming Common Limited Partner within five business days after the receipt
by the Company of such Notice of Redemption.

 



      
 

 



 

In the event the General Partner shall exercise its right to purchase Class A
Common Units with respect to the exercise of a Common Unit Redemption Right,
the Partnership shall have no obligation to pay any amount to the Redeeming
Common Limited Partner with respect to such Redeeming Common Limited Partners
exercise of such Common Unit Redemption Right, and each of the Redeeming
Common Limited Partner, the Partnership and the General Partner shall treat
the transaction between the General Partner and the Redeeming Common Limited
Partner for federal income tax purposes as a sale of the Redeeming Common
Limited Partners Class A Common Units to the General Partner. Each Redeeming
Common Limited Partner agrees to execute such documents as the General Partner
may reasonably require in connection with the issuance of REIT Shares upon
exercise of the Common Unit Redemption Right.

 



 

(c) Notwithstanding the provisions of Section 8.04(a) and 8.04(b) hereof, a
Limited Partner shall not be entitled to exercise the Common Unit Redemption
Right if the delivery of REIT Shares to such Limited Partner on the Specified
Redemption Date by the Company pursuant to Section 8.04(b) hereof (regardless
of whether or not the Company would in fact exercise its rights under Section
8.04(b) hereof) would (i) result in such Limited Partner or any other Person
(as defined in the Charter) owning, directly or indirectly, REIT Shares in
excess of the Ownership Limit and calculated in accordance therewith, except
as provided in the Charter, (ii) result in REIT Shares being owned by fewer
than 100 persons (determined without reference to any rules of attribution),
(iii) result in the Company being "closely held" within the meaning of Section
856(h) of the Code, (iv) cause the Company to own, actually or constructively,
10% or more of the ownership interests in a tenant (other than a TRS) of the
Companys, the Partnerships or a Subsidiary Partnerships real property,
within the meaning of Section 856(d)(2)(B) of the Code, (v) otherwise cause
the Company to fail to qualify as a REIT under the Code, or (vi) cause the
acquisition of REIT Shares by such Limited Partner to be "integrated" with any
other distribution of REIT Shares or Class A Common Units for purposes of
complying with the registration provisions of the Securities Act. The Company
agrees to maintain an effective registration statement for the issuance or
resale of REIT Shares. The General Partner, in its sole and absolute
discretion and without the consent of any other Partner or Person, may waive
the restriction on redemption set forth in this Section 8.04(c).

 



 

(d) Any Common Cash Amount to be paid to a Redeeming Common Limited Partner
pursuant to this Section 8.04 shall be paid on the Specified Redemption Date.

 



 

(e) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, the General Partner
is authorized to take any action that it determines to be necessary or
appropriate to cause the Partnership to comply with any withholding
requirements established under the Code or any other federal, state or local
law that apply upon a Redeeming Common Limited Partners exercise of the
Common Unit Redemption Right. If a Redeeming Common Limited Partner believes
that it is exempt from such withholding upon the exercise of the Common Unit
Redemption Right, such Partner must furnish the General Partner with a FIRPTA
Certificate in substantially the form attached hereto as Exhibit C-1 or
Exhibit C-2. If the Partnership or the General Partner is required to withhold
and pay over to any taxing authority any amount upon a Redeeming Common
Limited Partners exercise of the Common Unit Redemption Right and if the
Common Unit Redemption Amount equals or exceeds the Withheld Amount, the
Withheld Amount shall be treated as an amount received by such Partner in
redemption of its Class A

 



      
 

 



 

Common Units. If, however, the Common Unit Redemption Amount is less than the
Withheld Amount, the Redeeming Common Limited Partner shall not receive any
portion of the Common Unit Redemption Amount, the Common Unit Redemption
Amount shall be treated as an amount received by such Partner in redemption of
its Class A Common Units, and the Partner shall contribute the excess of the
Withheld Amount over the Common Unit Redemption Amount to the Partnership
before the Partnership is required to pay over such excess to a taxing
authority.

 



 

(f) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, the General Partner
shall place appropriate restrictions on the ability of the Limited Partners to
exercise their Common Unit Redemption Rights as and if deemed necessary to
ensure that the Partnership does not constitute a "publicly traded
partnership" taxable as a corporation under Section 7704 of the Code. If and
when the General Partner determines that imposing such restrictions is
necessary, the General Partner shall give prompt written notice thereof (a "
**Restriction Notice** ") to each of the Limited Partners, which notice shall
be accompanied by a copy of an opinion of counsel to the Partnership that
states that, in the opinion of such counsel, restrictions are necessary in
order to avoid the Partnership being treated as a "publicly traded
partnership" under Section 7704 of the Code.

 



 

 **8.05 _Preferred Unit Redemption Right_**.

 



 

(a) Subject to Sections 8.05(b), (c), (d) and (e) hereof and the provisions of
any agreements between the Partnership and one or more Limited Partners with
respect to Preferred Units held by them, for a period of 90 days beginning
April 1, 2014 (the " **Initial Preferred Put Window** ") or any time beginning
one year after the expiration of the Preferred Call Window if the General
Partner has not delivered a Call Notice pursuant to Section 8.06(b), each
holder of Preferred Units shall have the right (the " **Preferred Unit
Redemption Right** ") to require the Partnership to redeem on a Specified
Redemption Date all of the Preferred Units held by such Limited Partner at a
redemption price equal to and in the form of the Preferred Unit Redemption
Amount to be paid by the Partnership. The Preferred Unit Redemption Right
shall be exercised pursuant to a Notice of Exercise of Redemption Right in
substantially the form attached hereto as _Exhibit B-2_ delivered to the
Partnership (with a copy to the General Partner) by the Limited Partner who is
exercising the Preferred Unit Redemption Right (the " **Redeeming Preferred
Limited Partner** "); _provided_ , _however_ , that the Partnership shall not
be obligated to satisfy such Preferred Unit Redemption Right if the General
Partner elects to purchase the Preferred Units subject to the Notice of
Redemption. The Redeeming Preferred Limited Partner shall have no right, with
respect to any Preferred Units so redeemed, to receive any distribution paid
with respect to Preferred Units if the record date for such distribution is on
or after the Specified Redemption Date.

 



 

(b) Notwithstanding the provisions of Section 8.05(a) hereof, a Limited
Partner that exercises the Preferred Unit Redemption Right shall be deemed to
have offered to sell the Preferred Units described in the Notice of Redemption
to the General Partner, and the General Partner may, in its sole and absolute
discretion, elect to purchase directly and acquire such Preferred Units by
paying to the Redeeming Preferred Limited Partner the Preferred Cash Amount on
the Specified Redemption Date, whereupon the General Partner shall acquire the
Preferred Units offered for redemption by the Redeeming Preferred Limited
Partner and shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as the owner
of such Preferred Units. If the General

 



      
 

 



 

Partner shall elect to exercise its right to purchase Preferred Units under
this Section 8.05(b) with respect to a Notice of Redemption, it shall so
notify the Redeeming Preferred Limited Partner within five business days after
the receipt by the General Partner of such Notice of Redemption.

 



 

In the event the General Partner shall exercise its right to purchase
Preferred Units with respect to the exercise of a Preferred Unit Redemption
Right, the Partnership shall have no obligation to pay any amount to the
Redeeming Preferred Limited Partner with respect to such Redeeming Preferred
Limited Partners exercise of such Preferred Unit Redemption Right, and each
of the Redeeming Preferred Limited Partner, the Partnership and the General
Partner shall treat the transaction between the General Partner and the
Redeeming Preferred Limited Partner for federal income tax purposes as a sale
of the Redeeming Preferred Limited Partners Preferred Units to the General
Partner.

 



 

(c) Any Preferred Cash Amount to be paid to a Redeeming Preferred Limited
Partner pursuant to this Section 8.05 shall be paid on the Specified
Redemption Date.

 



 

(d) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, the General Partner
is authorized to take any action that it determines to be necessary or
appropriate to cause the Partnership to comply with any withholding
requirements established under the Code or any other federal, state or local
law that apply upon a Redeeming Preferred Limited Partners exercise of the
Preferred Unit Redemption Right. If a Redeeming Preferred Limited Partner
believes that it is exempt from such withholding upon the exercise of the
Preferred Unit Redemption Right, such Partner must furnish the General Partner
with a FIRPTA Certificate in substantially the form attached hereto as Exhibit
C-1 or Exhibit C-2. If the Partnership or the General Partner is required to
withhold and pay over to any taxing authority any amount upon a Redeeming
Preferred Limited Partners exercise of the Preferred Unit Redemption Right
and if the Preferred Unit Redemption Amount equals or exceeds the Withheld
Amount, the Withheld Amount shall be treated as an amount received by such
Partner in redemption of its Preferred Units. If, however, the Preferred Unit
Redemption Amount is less than the Withheld Amount, the Redeeming Preferred
Limited Partner shall not receive any portion of the Preferred Unit Redemption
Amount, the Preferred Unit Redemption Amount shall be treated as an amount
received by such Partner in redemption of its Preferred Units, and the Partner
shall contribute the excess of the Withheld Amount over the Preferred Unit
Redemption Amount to the Partnership before the Partnership is required to pay
over such excess to a taxing authority.

 



 

(e) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, the General Partner
shall place appropriate restrictions on the ability of the Limited Partners to
exercise their Preferred Unit Redemption Rights as and if deemed necessary to
ensure that the Partnership does not constitute a "publicly traded
partnership" taxable as a corporation under Section 7704 of the Code. If and
when the General Partner determines that imposing such restrictions is
necessary, the General Partner shall give a Restriction Notice to each of the
Limited Partners, which notice shall be accompanied by a copy of an opinion of
counsel to the Partnership that states that, in the opinion of such counsel,
restrictions are necessary in order to avoid the Partnership being treated as
a "publicly traded partnership" under Section 7704 of the Code.

 



       
 

 



 

 **8.06** ** ****_Redemption of Units at General Partner s Option_**.

 



 

(a) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, for a period
of 30 days beginning one year after the expiration of the Initial Common Put
Window (the " **Common Call Window** "), the General Partner may, in its sole
and absolute discretion, require any holder of Class A Common Units (by
delivering a Call Notice to such holder of Class A Common Units) to tender all
of its Class A Common Units to the General Partner in exchange for, at the
election of and in the sole and absolute discretion of the General Partner,
either the Common Cash Amount or a number of REIT Shares equal to the Common
REIT Shares Amount payable on the Specified Redemption Date and otherwise in
accordance with the procedures and provisions set forth in 8.04(a) and
8.04(b).

 



 

(b) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, for a period
of 30 days beginning one year after the expiration of the Initial Preferred
Put Window (the " **Preferred Call Window** "), the General Partner may, in
its sole and absolute discretion, require any holder of Preferred Units (by
delivering a Call Notice to such holder of Preferred Units) to tender all of
its Preferred Units outstanding to the General Partner in exchange for the
Preferred Cash Amount payable on the Specified Redemption Date and otherwise
in accordance with the procedures and provisions set forth in 8.05(a) and
8.05(b).

 



 

 **ARTICLE IX. _ 
TRANSFERS OF PARTNERSHIP INTERESTS_**

 



 

 **9.01** ** ****_Purchase for Investment_**.

 



 

(a) Each Limited Partner, by its signature below or by its subsequent
admission to the Partnership, hereby represents and warrants to the General
Partner and to the Partnership that the acquisition of such Limited Partners
Partnership Units is made for investment purposes only and not with a view to
the resale or distribution of such Partnership Units.

 



 

(b) Subject to the provisions of Section 9.02 hereof, each Limited Partner
agrees that such Limited Partner will not Transfer such Limited Partners
Partnership Units or any fraction thereof, whether voluntarily or by operation
of law or at judicial sale or otherwise, to any Person who does not make the
representations and warranties to the General Partner set forth in Section
9.01(a) hereof.

 



 

 **9.02** ** ****_Restrictions on Transfer of Partnership Units_**.

 



 

(a) Except as provided herein and subject to the provisions of Sections
9.02(b), (c) and (d) hereof, to the fullest extent permitted by law, no
Limited Partner may offer, sell, assign, hypothecate, pledge or otherwise
transfer all or any portion of such Limited Partners Partnership Units, or
any of such Limited Partners economic rights as a Limited Partner, whether
voluntarily or by operation of law or at judicial sale or otherwise
(collectively, a " **Transfer** ") without the consent of the General Partner,
which consent may be granted or withheld in its sole and absolute discretion.
The General Partner may require, as a condition of any Transfer to which it
consents, that the transferor assume all costs incurred by the Partnership in
connection therewith.

 



      
 

 



 

(b) No Limited Partner may withdraw from the Partnership other than as a
result of a permitted Transfer (i.e., a Transfer consented to as contemplated
by clause (a) above or clause (c) below or a Transfer pursuant to Section 9.05
hereof) of all of such Limited Partners Partnership Units pursuant to this
Article IX or pursuant to a redemption of all of such Limited Partners Class
A Common Units and Preferred Units pursuant to Sections 8.04 and 8.05 hereof.
Upon the permitted Transfer or redemption of all of a Limited Partners
Partnership Units, such Limited Partner shall cease to be a Limited Partner.

 



 

(c) Subject to Sections 9.02(d), (e) and (f) hereof, a Limited Partner may
Transfer, with the consent of the General Partner, all or a portion of such
Limited Partners Partnership Units to such Limited Partners (i) parent or
parents spouse, (ii) spouse, (iii) natural or adopted descendant or
descendants, (iv) spouse of such Limited Partners descendant, (v) brother or
sister, (vi) trust created by such Limited Partner for the primary benefit of
such Limited Partner and/or any such Person(s) described in (i) through (v)

other commercial entity in the business of acting as a fiduciary in its
ordinary course of business and having an equity capitalization of at least
$100,000,000 is a trustee, (vii) a corporation, partnership or limited
liability company controlled by such Limited Partner and/or a Person or
Persons named in (i) through (v) above, or (viii) if the Limited Partner is an
entity, its beneficial owners.

 



 

(d) No Limited Partner may effect a Transfer of its Partnership Units, in
whole or in part, if, in the opinion of legal counsel for the Partnership,
such proposed Transfer would require the registration of the Partnership Units
under the Securities Act or would otherwise violate any applicable federal or
state securities or blue sky law (including investment suitability standards).

 



 

(e) No Transfer by a Limited Partner of its Partnership Units, in whole or in
part, may be made to any Person if the General Partner determine, in their
commercially reasonable discretion, that (i) such Transfer would result in the
Partnership being treated as an association taxable as a corporation (other
than a qualified REIT subsidiary within the meaning of Section 856(i) of the
Code), (ii) it would adversely affect the ability of the Company to continue
to qualify as a REIT or subject the Company to any additional taxes under
Section 857 or Section 4981 of the Code or (iii) such Transfer is effectuated
through an "established securities market" or a "secondary market (or the
substantial equivalent thereof)" within the meaning of Section 7704 of the
Code; provided, that if the General Partner secures an opinion of nationally
recognized United States tax counsel that the Partnership would, if such
Transfer were completed, satisfy one or more provisions under Section 7704 of
the Code and the Regulations promulgated thereunder such that the Partnership
would not be treated as a "publicly traded partnership" for U.S. federal
income tax purposes, then such Transfer shall not be prohibited by this
Section 9.02(e).

 



 

(f) To the fullest extent permitted by law, any purported Transfer in
contravention of any of the provisions of this Article IX shall be void ab
initio and ineffectual and shall not be binding upon, or recognized by, the
General Partner or the Partnership.

 



      
 

 



 

(g) Prior to the consummation of any Transfer under this Article IX, the
transferor and/or the transferee shall deliver to the General Partner such
opinions, certificates and other documents as the General Partner shall
request in connection with such Transfer.

 



 

(h) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, AREP shall not
Transfer any of its Class A Common Units until the Chargeback Allocation has
occurred in full.

 



 

 **9.03** ** ****_Admission of Substitute Limited Partner_**.

 



 

(a) Subject to the other provisions of this Article IX, an assignee of the
Partnership Units of a Limited Partner (which shall be understood to include
any purchaser, transferee, donee or other recipient of any disposition of such
Partnership Units) shall be deemed admitted as a Limited Partner of the
Partnership only with the consent of the General Partner, which consent may be
given or withheld by the General Partner in its sole and absolute discretion,
and upon the satisfactory completion of the following:

 



 

(i) The assignee shall have accepted and agreed to be bound by the terms and
provisions of this Agreement by executing a counterpart or an amendment
thereof, including a revised _Exhibit A_ , and such other documents or
instruments as the General Partner may require in order to effect the
admission of such Person as a Limited Partner.

 



 

(ii) The assignee shall have delivered a letter containing the representation
set forth in Section 9.01(a) hereof and the representations and warranties set
forth in Section 9.01(b) hereof.

 



 

(iii) If the assignee is a corporation, partnership or trust, the assignee
shall have provided the General Partner with evidence satisfactory to counsel
for the Partnership of the assignees authority to become a Limited Partner
under the terms and provisions of this Agreement.

 



 

(iv) The assignee shall have executed a power of attorney containing the terms
and provisions set forth in Section 8.02 hereof.

 



 

(v) The assignee shall have paid all legal fees and other expenses of the
Partnership and the General Partner and filing and publication costs in
connection with its substitution as a Limited Partner.

 



 

(vi) The assignee shall have obtained the prior written consent of the General
Partner to its admission as a Substitute Limited Partner, which consent may be
given or denied in the exercise of the General Partners sole and absolute
discretion.

 



 

(b) For the purpose of allocating Net Income and Net Loss and distributing
cash received by the Partnership, a Substitute Limited Partner shall be
treated as having become, and appearing in the records of the Partnership as,
a Limited Partner on the later of the date

 



      
 

 



 

specified in the transfer documents or the date on which the General Partner
has received all necessary instruments of transfer and substitution.

 



 

(c) The General Partner and the Substitute Limited Partner shall cooperate
with each other by preparing the documentation required by this Section 9.03
and making all official filings and publications. The Partnership shall take
all such action as promptly as practicable after the satisfaction of the
conditions in this Article IX to the admission of such Person as a Limited
Partner of the Partnership.

 



 

 **9.04** ** ****_Rights of Assignees of Partnership Units_**.

 



 

(a) Subject to the provisions of Sections 9.01 and 9.02 hereof, except as
required by operation of law, the Partnership shall not be obligated for any
purposes whatsoever to recognize the assignment by any Limited Partner of its
Partnership Units until the Partnership has received notice thereof.

 



 

(b) Any Person who is the assignee of all or any portion of a Limited
Partners Partnership Units, but does not become a Substitute Limited Partner
and desires to make a further assignment of such Partnership Units, shall be
subject to all the provisions of this Article IX to the same extent and in the
same manner as any Limited Partner desiring to make an assignment of its
Partnership Units.

 



 

 **9.05** ** ****_Effect of Bankruptcy, Death, Incompetence or Termination of
a Limited Partner_**. To the fullest extent permitted by law, the occurrence
of an Event of Bankruptcy as to a Limited Partner, the death of a Limited
Partner or a final adjudication that a Limited Partner is incompetent (which
term shall include, but not be limited to, insanity) shall not, in and of
itself, cause the termination or dissolution of the Partnership, and the
business of the Partnership shall continue, and such Limited Partners
personal representative (as defined in the Act) shall have the rights of such
Limited Partner for the purpose of settling or managing such Limited Partners
estate property and such power as the bankrupt, deceased or incompetent
Limited Partner possessed to assign all or any part of such Limited Partners
Partnership Units and to join with the assignee in satisfying conditions
precedent to the admission of the assignee as a Substitute Limited Partner.

 



 

 **9.06** ** ****_Joint Ownership of Partnership Units_**. A Partnership Unit
may be acquired by two individuals as joint tenants with right of
survivorship, _provided_ that such individuals either are married or are
related and share the same home as tenants in common. The written consent or
vote of both owners of any such jointly held Partnership Unit shall be
required to constitute the action of the owners of such Partnership Unit;
_provided_ , _however_ , that the written consent of only one joint owner will
be required if the Partnership has been provided with evidence satisfactory to
the counsel for the Partnership that the actions of a single joint owner can
bind both owners under the applicable laws of the state of residence of such
joint owners. Upon the death of one owner of a Partnership Unit held in a
joint tenancy with a right of survivorship, the Partnership Unit shall become
owned solely by the survivor as a Limited Partner and not as an assignee. The
Partnership need not recognize the death of one of the owners of a jointly-
held Partnership Unit until it shall have received notice of such death. Upon
notice to the General Partner from either owner, the General Partner shall
cause the Partnership Unit to be divided into

 



      
 

 



 

two equal Partnership Units, which shall thereafter be owned separately by
each of the former owners.

 



 

 **ARTICLE X. _ 
BOOKS AND RECORDS; ACCOUNTING; TAX MATTERS_**

 



 

 **10.01** ** ****_Books and Records_**. At all times during the continuance
of the Partnership, the General Partner shall keep or cause to be kept at the
Partnerships specified office true and complete books of account in
accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, including: (a) a
current list of the full name and last known business address of each Partner,
(b) a copy of the Certificate of Limited Partnership of the Partnership and
all certificates of amendment thereto, (c) copies of the Partnerships
federal, state and local income tax returns and reports, (d) copies of this
Agreement and any financial statements of the Partnership for the three most
recent years and (e) all documents and information required under the Act. Any
Limited Partner or its duly authorized representative, for any purpose
reasonably related to such Limited Partners interest as a limited partner in
the Partnership, upon paying the costs of collection, duplication and mailing,
shall be entitled to inspect or copy such records during ordinary business
hours.

 



 

 **10.02** ** ****_Custody of Partnership Funds; Bank Accounts._**

 



 

(a) All funds of the Partnership not otherwise invested shall be deposited in
one or more accounts maintained in such banking or brokerage institutions as
the General Partner shall determine, and withdrawals shall be made only on
such signature or signatures as the General Partner may, from time to time,
determine.

 



 

(b) All deposits and other funds not needed in the operation of the business
of the Partnership may be invested by the General Partner. The funds of the
Partnership shall not be commingled with the funds of any other Person except
for such commingling as may necessarily result from an investment in those
investment companies permitted by this Section 10.02(b).

 



 

 **10.03** ** ****_Fiscal and Taxable Year_**. The fiscal and taxable year of
the Partnership shall be the calendar year unless otherwise required by the
Code.

 



 

 **10.04** ** ****_Annual Tax Information and Report_**. Within 75 days after
the end of each fiscal year of the Partnership, or as soon as practicable
thereafter, the General Partner shall furnish to each Person who was a Limited
Partner at any time during such year the tax information necessary to file
such Limited Partners individual tax returns as shall be reasonably required
by law.

 



 

 **10.05** ** ****_Tax Matters Partner; Tax Elections; Special Basis
Adjustments_**.

 



 

(a) The General Partner shall be the Tax Matters Partner of the Partnership.
As Tax Matters Partner, the General Partner shall have the right and
obligation to take all actions authorized and required, respectively, by the
Code for the Tax Matters Partner. The General Partner shall have the right to
retain professional assistance in respect of any audit of the Partnership by
the Service and all out-of-pocket expenses and fees incurred by the General

 



      
 

 



 

Partner on behalf of the Partnership as Tax Matters Partner shall constitute
Partnership expenses. In the event the General Partner receives notice of a
final Partnership adjustment under Section 6223(a)(2) of the Code, the General
Partner shall either (i) file a court petition for judicial review of such
final adjustment within the period provided under Section 6226(a) of the Code,
a copy of which petition shall be mailed to all Limited Partners on the date
such petition is filed, or (ii) mail a written notice to all Limited Partners,
within such period, that describes the General Partners reasons for
determining not to file such a petition.

 



 

(b) All elections required or permitted to be made by the Partnership under
the Code or any applicable state or local tax law shall be made by the General
Partner in its sole and absolute discretion.

 



 

(c) In the event of a transfer of all or any part of the Partnership Interest
of any Partner, the Partnership, at the option of the General Partner, may
elect pursuant to Section 754 of the Code to adjust the basis of the
Properties. Notwithstanding anything contained in Article V of this Agreement,
any adjustments made pursuant to Section 754 shall affect only the successor
in interest to the transferring Partner and in no event shall be taken into
account in establishing, maintaining or computing Capital Accounts for the
other Partners for any purpose under this Agreement. Each Partner will furnish
the Partnership with all information necessary to give effect to such
election.

 



 

(d) In the event that the General Partner shall be removed or replaced
pursuant to any provision of this Agreement, the successor to the General
Partner shall assume the obligations of this Section 10.05.

 



 

(e) The Partners, intending to be legally bound, hereby authorize the
Partnership to make an election (the " **Safe Harbor Election** ") to have the
"liquidation value" safe harbor provided in Proposed Treasury Regulation §
1.83-3(1) and the Proposed Revenue Procedure set forth in Internal Revenue
Service Notice 2005-43, as such safe harbor may be modified when such proposed
guidance is issued in final form or as amended by subsequently issued guidance
(the " **Safe Harbor** "), apply to any interest in the Partnership
transferred to a service provider while the Safe Harbor Election remains
effective, to the extent such interest meets the Safe Harbor requirements
(collectively, such interests are referred to as " **Safe Harbor Interests**
"). The Tax Matters Partner is authorized and directed to execute and file the
Safe Harbor Election on behalf of the Partnership and the Partners. The
Partnership and the Partners (including any Person to whom an interest in the
Partnership is transferred in connection with the performance of services)
hereby agree to comply with all requirements of the Safe Harbor (including
forfeiture allocations) with respect to all Safe Harbor Interests and to
prepare and file all U.S. federal income tax returns reporting the tax
consequences of the issuance and vesting of Safe Harbor Interests consistent
with such final Safe Harbor guidance. The Partnership is also authorized to
take such actions as are necessary to achieve, under the Safe Harbor, the
effect that the election and compliance with all requirements of the Safe
Harbor referred to above would be intended to achieve under Proposed Treasury
Regulation § 1.83-3, including amending this Agreement.

 



      
 

 



 

 **10.06** ** ****_Reports to Limited Partners_**.

 



 

(a) If the Company is required to furnish an annual report to its stockholders
containing financial statements of the Company, the Company will, at the same
time and in the same manner, furnish such annual report to each Limited
Partner.

 



 

(b) Any Partner shall further have the right to a private audit of the books
and records of the Partnership, _provided_ that such audit is made for
Partnership purposes, at the sole expense of the Partner desiring it and is
made during normal business hours.

 



 

 **ARTICLE XI. _ 
AMENDMENT OF AGREEMENT; MERGER_**

 



 

 **11.01** ** ****_Amendment of Agreement_**.

 



 

Except as otherwise provided herein, the General Partners written consent
shall be required for any amendment to this Agreement. Except as otherwise
provided herein, the General Partner, without the consent of the Limited
Partners or any other Person, may amend this Agreement in any respect;
_provided_ , _however_ , that the following amendments shall require both (i)
the Consent of the Class A Limited Partners and (ii) the Limited Partners
holding more than a majority of the Preferred Units:

 



 

(a) any amendment affecting the operation of the Conversion Factor or the
Common Unit Redemption Right or Preferred Unit Redemption Right (except as
otherwise provided herein) in a manner that adversely affects the Limited
Partners benefitting from those provisions in any material respect;

 



 

(b) any amendment that would adversely affect the rights of the Limited
Partners in any material respect to receive the distributions payable to them
hereunder, other than with respect to the issuance of additional Partnership
Units pursuant to Section 4.02 hereof;

 



 

(c) any amendment that would alter the Partnerships allocations of Net Income
and Net Loss to the Limited Partners, other than with respect to the issuance

(d) any amendment that would impose on the Limited Partners any obligation to
make additional Capital Contributions to the Partnership; or

 



 

(e) any amendment to this Article XI.

 



 

 **11.02** ** ****_Merger of Partnership_**.

 



 

Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement, the General Partner, without
the consent of the Limited Partners or any other Person, may (i) merge or
consolidate the Partnership with or into any other domestic or foreign
partnership, limited partnership, limited liability company, corporation or
other Person or (ii) sell all or substantially all of the assets of the
Partnership in a transaction pursuant to Section 7.02(a) or (b) hereof and may
amend this Agreement in any manner or adopt a new limited partnership
agreement for the Partnership in connection with any such transaction

 **12.02** ** ****_Survival of Rights_**. Subject to the provisions hereof
limiting transfers, this Agreement shall be binding upon and inure to the
benefit of the Partners and the Partnership and their respective legal
representatives, successors, transferees and assigns.

 



 

 **12.03** ** ****_Additional Documents_**. Each Partner agrees to perform all
further acts and execute, swear to, acknowledge and deliver all further
documents that may be reasonable, necessary, appropriate or desirable to carry
out the provisions of this Agreement or the Act.

 



 

 **12.04** ** ****_Severability_**. If any provision of this Agreement shall
be declared illegal, invalid or unenforceable in any jurisdiction, then such
provision shall be deemed to be severable from this Agreement (to the extent
permitted by law) and in any event such illegality, invalidity or
unenforceability shall not affect the remainder hereof.

 



 

 **12.05** ** ****_Entire Agreement_**. This Agreement and exhibits attached
hereto constitute the entire Agreement of the Partners and supersede all prior
written agreements and prior and contemporaneous oral agreements,
understandings and negotiations with respect to the subject matter hereof. In
furtherance of the foregoing, the Partners acknowledge that the First Restated
Agreement is hereby superseded in its entirety and this Agreement amends and
restates any prior agreement of limited partnership of the Partnership.

 



 

 **12.06** ** ****_Pronouns and Plurals_**. When the context in which words
are used in the Agreement indicates that such is the intent, words in the
singular number shall include the plural and the masculine gender shall
include the neuter or female gender as the context may require.

 **ARTICLE XIII. _

unconditionally guarantees, as primary obligor and not merely as surety, the
payment and performance of all obligations of the General Partner under
Sections 8.05 and 8.06 of this Agreement (the " **Guaranteed Obligations** ").

 



 

 **13.02** ** ****_Certain Waivers_**. To the fullest extent permitted by
applicable law, the Company waives presentment to, demand of payment from and
protest to each Limited Partner, and also waives notice of acceptance of the
guarantee pursuant to this _Article XIII_ and notice of protest for non-
payment. To the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, the obligations of
the Company hereunder shall not be affected by the failure of any Limited
Partner to assert any claim or demand or to exercise or enforce any right or
remedy against the General Partner under the provisions of this Agreement or
otherwise.

 



 

 **13.03** ** ****_Guarantee Absolute_**. The Company agrees that the
guarantee pursuant to this _Article XIII_ constitutes an absolute,
unconditional, present and continuing guarantee of payment and not of
collection, and waives any right to require that any resort be had by any
Limited Partner (a) against the General Partner or any other Person for the
Guaranteed Obligations or (b) against any other right or remedy available to
any Limited Partner by contract, applicable law or otherwise. It is the intent
of the guarantee pursuant to this _Article XIII_ that each Limited Partner
shall have resort to the Company without asserting or resorting to any remedy
against the General Partner or any other Person and without demand to it, as
though the Company was primarily liable for any Guaranteed Obligations.

 



 

 **13.04** ** ****_Additional Waivers_**. Without limiting the foregoing, the
Company hereby waives and relinquishes all rights and remedies now or
hereafter accorded by applicable law to sureties and/or guarantors or any
other accommodation parties, under any statutory provision, common law or any
other provision of law, custom or practice, and agrees not to assert or take
advantage of any such rights or remedies, including, without limitation, (a)
any right to require any Limited Partner to proceed against the General
Partner or any other Person or to proceed against or exhaust any security held
by any Limited Partner at any time or to pursue any other remedy in such
Limited Partners power before proceeding against the Company; (b) any defense
based upon any lack of authority of the officers, directors, partners or
agents acting or purporting to act on behalf of the General Partner or any
other Person, or any defect in the formation of the General Partner or any
other Person; (c) any defense that may arise by reason of the Incapacity, lack
of authority, insolvency, bankruptcy, death or disability of the General
Partner or any other guarantor or other Person or the failure of any Limited
Partner to file or enforce a claim against the estate (in administration,
bankruptcy or any other proceeding) of the General Partner or any other
guarantor or other Person; (d) notice of the existence, creation or incurring
of any new or additional indebtedness or obligation of the General Partner
under this Agreement or of any action or non-action on the part of the General
Partner under this Agreement or in connection with any Guaranteed Obligation;
(e) any defense based upon an election of remedies by any Limited Partner
which destroys or otherwise impairs any subrogation rights of the Company or
any right of the Company to proceed against the General Partner or any other
Person for reimbursement, or both; (f) any defense based upon any statute or

 



      
 

 



 

rule of law which provides that the obligation of a surety must be neither
larger in amount nor in other respects more burdensome than that of the
principal; (g) any duty on the part of any Limited Partner to disclose to the
Company any facts any Limited Partner may now or hereafter know about the
General Partner, regardless of whether any Limited Partner has reason to
believe that any such fact materially increases the risk beyond that which the
Company intends to assume or has reason to believe that any such fact is
unknown to the Company or has a reasonable opportunity to communicate such
fact to the Company, it being understood and agreed that the Company is fully
responsible for being and keeping informed of the financial condition of the
General Partner and of all circumstances bearing on the risk of nonpayment or
non-performance of any Guaranteed Obligation; (h) any defense arising because
of any Limited Partners election, in any proceeding instituted under the
federal Bankruptcy Code; (i) any defense based upon the validity or
enforceability of this Agreement; (j) any defense or rights arising under any
appraisal, valuation, stay, extension, marshaling of assets, redemption or
similar law or requirement, which may delay, prevent or otherwise affect the
performance by the Company of any of the Guaranteed Obligations; (k)
diligence, presentment and demand; (l) any requirement to mitigate any damages
resulting from any default under this Agreement; and (m) any defense based on
any borrowing or grant of a security interest under Section 364 of the federal
Bankruptcy Code.

 



 

 **13.05** ** ****_No Waiver by Limited Partner_**. This _Article XIII_ and
any right of any Limited Partner hereunder may be waived in whole or in part,
and the Company may be released from its obligations hereunder, only with the
Consent of the Class A Limited Partners.

Re: _Agreement and Plan of Merger dated as of September 6, 2012_

 



 

Ladies and Gentlemen:

 



 

We have acted as special counsel to Realty Income Corporation, a Maryland
corporation (" _Realty Income_ "), in connection with the proposed merger (the
" _Merger_ ") of American Realty Capital Trust, Inc., a Maryland corporation
(" _ARCT_ "), with and into Tau Acquisition LLC, a Delaware limited liability
company (" _Merger Sub_ "), a wholly owned subsidiary of Realty Income, with
Merger Sub surviving. The Merger will be consummated pursuant to the Agreement
and Plan of Merger dated as of September 6, 2012 (the " _Merger Agreement_ ").
Capitalized terms not defined herein have the meanings specified in the Merger
Agreement unless otherwise indicated.

 



 

In acting as counsel to Realty Income in connection with the Merger, we have
participated in the preparation of the Merger Agreement, and pursuant to
Section 7.2(f) of the Merger Agreement, you have requested our opinion
regarding whether, on the basis of the facts, representations and assumptions
set forth herein, the Merger will qualify as a reorganization within the
meaning of Section 368(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended
(the " _Code_ "). In rendering our opinion, we have examined and, with your
consent, are expressly relying upon (without any independent investigation or
review thereof) the truth and accuracy of the factual statements,
representations and warranties contained in (i) the Merger Agreement
(including any Exhibits and Schedules thereto), (ii) the Registration
Statement and the Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus, (iii) the respective tax
representation letters of Realty Income and Merger Sub and of ARCT delivered
to us for purposes of this opinion (the " _Officer s Certificates_"), and
(iv) such other documents and corporate records as we have deemed necessary or
appropriate for purposes of our opinion.

 



 

In addition, we have assumed, with your consent, that:

 



 

1. Original documents (including signatures) are authentic, and documents submitted to us as copies conform to the original documents, and there has been (or will be by the Effective Time of the Merger) execution and delivery of all documents where execution and delivery are prerequisites to the effectiveness thereof;

 



 

2. The Merger will be consummated in the manner contemplated by, and in accordance with the provisions of, the Merger Agreement, the Registration Statement and the Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus, and the Merger will be effective under the laws of the State of Maryland;

 



 

3. All factual statements, descriptions and representations contained in any of the documents referred to herein or otherwise made to us are true, complete and

      
 

 



 

correct in all respects and will remain true, complete and correct in all
respects up to and including the Effective Time, and no actions have been
taken or will be taken which are inconsistent with such factual statements,
descriptions or representations or which make any such factual statements,
descriptions or representations untrue, incomplete or incorrect at the
Effective Time;

 



 

4. Any statements made in any of the documents referred to herein "to the knowledge of" or similarly qualified are true, complete and correct in all respects and will continue to be true, complete and correct in all respects at all times up to and including the Effective Time, in each case without such qualification; and

 



 

5. The parties have complied with and, if applicable, will continue to comply with, the covenants contained in the Merger Agreement, the Registration Statement and the Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus.

 



 

Based upon and subject to the foregoing, and subject to the qualifications and
limitations stated herein, we are of the opinion that, for United States
federal income tax purposes, the Merger will be treated as a "reorganization"
within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code.

 



 

In addition to the matters set forth above, this opinion is subject to the
exceptions, limitations and qualifications set forth below.

 



 

1. This opinion represents our best judgment regarding the application of United States federal income tax laws arising under the Code, existing judicial decisions, administrative regulations and published rulings and procedures, but does not address all of the United States federal income tax consequences of the Merger. We express no opinion as to United States federal, state, local, foreign, or other tax consequences, other than as set forth herein. Our opinion is not binding upon the Internal Revenue Service or the courts, and there is no assurance that the Internal Revenue Service will not assert a contrary position. Furthermore, no assurance can be given that future legislative, judicial or administrative changes, on either a prospective or retroactive basis, would not adversely affect the accuracy of the conclusions stated herein. Nevertheless, we undertake no responsibility to advise you of any new developments in the application or interpretation of the United States federal income tax laws.

 



 

2. No opinion is expressed as to any transaction other than the Merger as described in the Merger Agreement, or to any transaction whatsoever, including the Merger, if, to the extent relevant to our opinion, either all the transactions described in the Merger Agreement are not consummated in accordance with the terms of the Merger Agreement and without waiver or breach of any provisions thereof or all of the factual statements, representations, warranties and assumptions upon which we have relied are not true and accurate at all relevant times.

 



 

This opinion is rendered only to you in connection with the Merger and
pursuant to the requirements of Section 7.2(f) of the Merger Agreement and is
not to be used, circulated, quoted

      
 

 



 

or otherwise referred to or relied upon for any other purpose without our
