consideration of Sellers transfer and assignment of the Assets to the Buyer
hereunder and shall be reported by all parties for all Tax purposes in a
manner consistent with this provision. In addition to the foregoing payment,
as consideration for the grant, sale, assignment, transfer and delivery of the
Assets, Buyer shall assume the Assumed Liabilities.

 



 

2.5 _Purchase Price Adjustments_.

 



 

(a) Not less than five (5) days prior to the Closing Date, Seller shall
deliver to Buyer a statement (the " **Closing Date Certificat** e"), which
sets forth Sellers reasonable, good faith estimate of the Estimated
Outstanding Accounts Payable and the Estimated Marketing Commitments,
including a reasonably detailed supporting calculation thereof. The Closing
Date Certificate shall be based upon the books and records of Seller and shall
be prepared in accordance with the accounting principles, methods and
practices utilized in preparing the audited Financial Statements, applied on a
consistent basis. The Seller shall consult with the Buyer in the preparation
of such Closing Date Certificate, shall provide the Buyer with a draft thereof
(together with any supporting work papers) prior to the Closing Date and shall
take into account the reasonable comments of the Buyer prior to preparing the
final Closing Date Certificate to be delivered pursuant to this _Section
2.5(a)_.

 



 

(b) Within 60 days after the Closing Date, the Buyer shall in good faith
prepare and deliver to the Seller a statement of the Accounts Payable and the
Marketing Commitments outstanding as of the Effective Time (the " **Post-
Closing Statement** "), including a reasonably detailed supporting calculation
thereof. The Post-Closing Statement shall (a) be based upon the books and
records of the Seller, (b) shall be prepared in accordance with the accounting
principles, methods and practices utilized in preparing the audited Financial
Statements, applied on a consistent basis, and (c) shall not include amounts
for Marketing Commitments that were not included in the Estimated Marketing
Commitments and to the extent the applicable marketing department of the
distributor provided evidence, prior to the Closing, of the satisfaction of
such Marketing Commitment pursuant to _Section 5.1(b)(viii)_.

 



 

(c) The Post-Closing Statement shall be final and binding on the parties
unless the Seller, within 45 days following the delivery of the Post-Closing
Statement, delivers to the Buyer written notice of disagreement with such
Post-Closing Statement, which notice shall (i) describe in detail the nature
of any such disagreement, (ii) identify the specific items involved and the
dollar amount of such disagreement and (iii) only include good faith
disagreements based on (A) components not being calculated in accordance with
the accounting principles, methods and practices utilized in preparing the
audited Financial Statements, applied on a consistent basis or (B)
mathematical errors. If the Seller delivers a written notice of disagreement
within the aforesaid 45-day

 



      
 

 



 

period, then the Seller and the Buyer shall seek in good faith to resolve in
writing the disputed matters set forth in such notice of disagreement within
30 days of receipt by the Buyer of a written notice of disagreement from the
Seller, or such longer period as may be agreed by the Buyer and the Seller. If
the Seller and the Buyer are unable to resolve all disagreements within such
30-day period, then the Seller and the Buyer (each, a " **Disputing Party** "
and together the " **Disputing Parties** ") shall submit such remaining
disagreements to the Miami office of Ernst and Young LLP or such other
nationally-recognized accounting, valuation or consulting firm as is
acceptable to the Disputing Parties (the " **Independent Accounting Firm** ")
for arbitration, in accordance with the standards set forth in this _Section
2.5_. Each of the parties represents and warrants that neither it nor any of
its Affiliates has a material relationship with the Independent Accounting
Firm. The Independent Accounting Firm so selected will consider only those
items and amounts set forth in the Post-Closing Statement as to which the
Disputing Parties have disagreed within the time periods and on the terms
specified above and must resolve the matter in accordance with the terms and
provisions of this Agreement. Each Disputing Party may furnish to the
Independent Accounting Firm such information and documents as it deems
relevant, with copies of such submission and all such documents and
information being concurrently given to the other Disputing Party. Neither
Disputing Party shall have or conduct any communication, either written or
oral, with the Independent Accounting Firm without the other Disputing Party
either being present or receiving a concurrent copy of any written
communication. The Independent Accounting Firm may conduct a conference
concerning the disagreements between the Disputing Parties, at which
conference each Disputing Party shall have the right to (i) present its
documents, materials and other evidence (previously provided to the
Independent Accounting Firm and the other Disputing Party) and (ii) have
present its or their advisors, accountants, counsel and other representatives.
The Independent Accounting Firm shall resolve each item of disagreement based
solely on the presentations and supporting material provided by the Disputing
Parties and not pursuant to any independent review and may not assign a value
to any particular item greater than the greatest value for such item claimed
by either Disputing Party or less than the lowest value for such item claimed
by either Disputing Party, in each case as presented to the Independent
Accounting Firm. The Independent Accounting Firm shall issue a detailed
written report that sets forth the resolution of all items in dispute and that
contains a final Post-Closing Statement. Such report shall be final and
binding upon the Disputing Parties. The fees and expenses of the Independent
Accounting Firm shall initially be borne equally between the Seller, on the
one hand, and the Buyer, on the other hand; provided, that such fees and
expenses shall ultimately be allocated in accordance with _Section 2.5(e)_.
The Disputing Parties shall cooperate fully with the Independent Accounting
Firm and respond on a timely basis to all requests for information or access
to documents or personnel made by the Independent Accounting Firm or by the
Disputing Parties, all with the intent to fairly and in good faith resolve all
disputes relating to the Post-Closing Statement as promptly as reasonably
practicable.

 



 

(d) Within five (5) Business Days following the final determination of the
Accounts Payable and the Marketing Commitments outstanding as of the Effective
Time in accordance with _Section 2.5(c)_, if there is a Purchase Price
Deficit, then the Seller shall pay to the Buyer an amount equal to such
excess. If there is

 



      
 

 



 

a Purchase Price Surplus, then the Buyer shall pay to the Seller an amount
equal to the Purchase Price Surplus.

 



 

(e) The fees, costs and expenses of the Independent Accounting Firm (i) shall
be paid by the Buyer in the proportion that the aggregate dollar amount of
such disputed items so submitted that are successfully disputed by Seller (as
finally determined by the Independent Accounting Firm) bears to the aggregate
dollar amount of such items so submitted, and (ii) shall be paid by the Seller
in the proportion that the aggregate dollar amount of such disputed items so
submitted that are unsuccessfully disputed by the Seller (as finally
determined by the Independent Accounting Firm) bears to the aggregate dollar
amount of such items so submitted.

 



 

2.6 _Allocation of the Purchase Price_.

 



 

(a) _Allocation of the Purchase Price among the Channels._ The Buyer and the
Seller agree that, for the Buyers and Sellers respective U.S. federal, state
and local income tax purposes, the sum of the Purchase Price and the Assumed
Liabilities assumed by the Buyer, to the extent such Assumed Liabilities
constitute part of the purchase price for Tax purposes, shall be allocated
among the Channels consistent with the allocation contained in _Schedule 2.6_
of the Company Disclosure Letter. The allocation contained in _Schedule 2.6_
of the Company Disclosure Letter will be adjusted to reflect adjustments to
the purchase price pursuant to this Agreement. For all Tax purposes, the Buyer
and the Seller will report the transactions contemplated by this Agreement in
a manner consistent with _Schedule 2.6_ of the Company Disclosure Letter,
including adjustments described in the prior sentence, and neither will take
any position inconsistent therewith in any Tax Return.

 



 

(b) _Negotiation of Asset Allocation Schedule Method_.

 



 

(i) Within 90 days after the Closing, the Buyer shall prepare and deliver to
the Seller a schedule (an " **Allocation Schedule** ") allocating the purchase
price allocated to each Channel pursuant to _Section 2.6(a)_ among the Assets
of such Channel, in such amounts reasonably determined by the Buyer to be
consistent with Section 1060 of the Code. For this purpose, the intangible
assets of the Channels shall include only their goodwill, going concern value,
unregistered copyrights, domain names, Affiliation Agreements, Trademarks and
Trade Secrets.

 



 

(ii) The Seller shall have a period of ten (10) Business Days after the
delivery of the Allocation Schedule (the " **Response Period** ") to present
in writing to the Buyer notice of any objections the Seller may have to the
allocations set forth therein (an " **Objections Notice** "). Unless the
Seller timely objects, such Allocation Schedule shall be binding on the
parties without further adjustment, absent manifest error.

 



 

(iii) If the Seller shall raise any objections within the Response Period, the
Buyer and the Seller shall negotiate in good faith and use their reasonable
best efforts to resolve such dispute. If the parties fail to agree within
fifteen

 



      
 

 



 

days after the delivery of the Objections Notice, then the disputed items
shall be resolved by the Independent Accounting Firm, in accordance with the
procedural principles of _Section 2.5(c)_.

 



 

(iv) For all Tax purposes, the Buyer and the Seller shall report the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement in a manner consistent with the
terms of this Agreement, and none of them will take any position inconsistent
therewith in any Tax Return, unless otherwise required by applicable Law.

 



 

 **SECTION 3 REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF THE SELLER**

 



 

The Seller hereby represents and warrants to the Buyer that the following
representations and warranties are true and complete as of the date hereof and
as of the Closing Date. For purposes of these representations and warranties
(other than those in _Section 3.2_), the term "the Seller" shall include the
Channel Operators.

 



 

3.1 _Organization, Standing and Authority_. The Seller is a limited liability
company duly organized, validly existing and in good standing under the laws
of its jurisdiction of formation and the Seller and the Channel Operators
have, together, all requisite power and lawful authority to own, lease and
operate the Business and the Assets, to carry on the Business as now conducted
and to execute, deliver and perform this Agreement and the other Transaction
Documents to which it is a party in accordance with their terms. The Seller is
qualified to transact business and is in good standing in each jurisdiction in
which the nature of the Business or location of the Assets requires such
qualification, except where the failure to be so qualified would not have or
reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect.

 



 

3.2 _Authorization and Binding Obligation_. The execution and delivery of this
Agreement and the other Transaction Documents to which the Seller is a party
and the performance by the Seller of the transactions contemplated hereby and
thereby have been duly authorized by all necessary actions on the part of the
Seller. This Agreement and the other Transaction Documents to which the Seller
is a party have been duly executed and delivered by the Seller and constitute
the legal, valid and binding obligation of the Seller, enforceable against the
Seller in accordance with their terms, except to the extent such
enforceability is limited by bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization,
moratorium or similar laws affecting creditors rights generally, and the
application of general principles of equity (collectively, the "
**Enforceability Exceptions** ").

 



 

3.3 _Absence of Conflicting Agreements_. Assuming the accuracy of the Buyers
representations and warranties in _Section 4_, the execution and delivery of
this Agreement and the other Transaction Documents to which the Seller is a
party and the performance by the Seller of the transactions contemplated
hereby and thereby (with or without the giving of notice, the lapse of time,
or both): (a) do not require the Consent of any Person, other than the
Consents set forth on _Schedule 3.3_ of the Company Disclosure Letter; (b)
will not conflict with any of the Sellers organizational documents, other
than as set forth on _Schedule 3.3_ of the Company Disclosure Letter; (c) are
not prohibited or

 



       
 

 



 

restricted by any Employee Plan or Collective Bargaining Agreement; (d) will
not conflict with, result in a breach or violation of, or constitute a default
under any material Order applicable to the Seller, the Assets or the Business;
(e) except as set forth on _Schedule 3.3_ of the Company Disclosure Letter,
will not conflict with, result in a material breach, impairment, loss or
violation of, or constitute a default under any of the Assets (including any
of the Assumed Contracts or any Material Contract to which the Seller is a
party); (f) except as set forth on _Schedule 3.3_ of the Company Disclosure
Letter, will not give rise to a right of termination, amendment, cancellation
or acceleration of any right or obligation of the Seller (including any right
or obligation of the Seller under any of the Assumed Contracts) or a loss of
any material benefit to which the Seller is entitled; (g) will not result in
the creation of any Lien upon any of the Assets, except as contemplated herein
or with respect to Permitted Liens; and (h) will not violate in any material
respect any applicable Legal Requirements applicable to the Seller, the Assets
or the Business.

 



 

3.4 _Books and Records_. The Books and Records, copies of which have been made
available to the Buyer, (i) have been kept in the Ordinary Course, and (ii) to
Sellers Knowledge, are true, complete and correct in all material respects.

 



 

3.5 _Ownership and Transfer of Assets_. The Seller or the Channel Operators
own and have good title to each of the Assets, free and clear of all Liens
(other than Permitted Liens), and other than as set forth on _Schedule 3.5_

if so required under the Securities Act or the Exchange Act, an unqualified
audit opinion from (x) Morrison, Brown, Argiz and Farra, LLC, the Sellers
independent public accounting firm or (y) to the extent Morrison, Brown, Argiz

at the Buyers written request, use its reasonable best efforts (including by

covenant or agreement contained herein.

 



 

9.2 _Indemnification by the Seller_. Subsequent to the Closing, and
notwithstanding the Closing, and regardless of any investigation made at any
time by or on behalf of the Buyer or any information the Buyer may have, the

Fifty Thousand United States Dollars ($12,750,000.00) (the " **Cap** "); (ii)

and until the aggregate Buyer Indemnified Parties Losses pursuant to _Section
9.2(a)_ exceed One Million Twenty Thousand United States Dollars
($1,020,000.00) (the " **Basket** "); _provided_ , that once such Buyer
Indemnified Parties Losses exceed the Basket, the Seller shall be responsible
and liable, subject to the limitations of sub-clause (i) hereof, for the
entirety of all such Buyer Indemnified Parties

 



       
 

 



 

Losses; and (iii) the Buyer Indemnified Parties shall not be entitled to
recover for any particular Loss pursuant to _Section 9.2(a)_ to the extent it
constitutes an Assumed Liability;

 



 

(b) Notwithstanding the provisions of this _Section 9_, it is specifically
acknowledged and agreed that (i) the aggregate liability of the Buyer pursuant
to _Section 9.3(a)_ shall not exceed the Cap; (ii) the Buyer shall not have
any liability pursuant to _Section 9.3(a)_ unless and until the aggregate
Seller Indemnified Parties Losses pursuant to _Section 9.3(a)_ exceed the
Basket; _provided_ , that once such Seller Indemnified Parties Losses exceed
the Basket, the Buyer shall be responsible and liable, subject to the
limitations of sub-clause (i) hereof, for the entirety of all such Seller
Indemnified Parties Losses; and (iii) the Seller Indemnified Parties shall
not be entitled to recover for any particular Loss pursuant to _Section
9.3(a)_ to the extent it constitutes a Retained Liability.

 



 

(c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth herein, the maximum
aggregate liability of the Seller under _Section 9_ shall be limited to the
amount of the final Purchase Price.

 



 

(d) The right to indemnification, payment of Losses or other remedies based on
any representations, warranties, covenants or agreements set forth in this
Agreement will not be affected by any investigation conducted with respect to
or any knowledge or information acquired at any time, whether before or after
the execution and delivery of this Agreement or the Closing Date, with respect
to the accuracy or inaccuracy of or compliance with, any such representation,
warranty, covenant or agreement (other than disclosures made in the Schedules
to the Company Disclosure Letter hereto).

 



 

(e) The waiver of any condition based on the accuracy of any representation or
warranty or on the performance of or compliance with any covenant or
agreement, will not affect the right to indemnification, payment of Losses or
other remedy based on such representations, warranties, covenants or
agreements.

 



 

(f) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary elsewhere in this Agreement, with
respect to determining whether (i) a breach of any of the representations and
warranties of the Seller has occurred for purposes of this _Section 9_ to the
extent it is not a Qualified Representation, or (ii) the amount of Losses
incurred or suffered, for such purposes, as a result of any such breach, any
Material Adverse Effect or materiality qualification limiting the scope of
such representations or warranties shall be disregarded to the extent such
representations or warranties are not Qualified Representations.

 



 

(g) Each indemnified party shall use commercially reasonable efforts to
mitigate any Losses in respect of which a claim could be made under this
_Section 9_, including seeking to obtain recovery in respect of any Losses
from any third party insurance or third party indemnity which is available in
respect of Losses. The amount of any Losses in respect of which a claim could
be made under this _Section 9_ shall be reduced to take account of any Tax
benefit actually realized by the indemnified

 



      
 

 



 

party arising from the incurrence or payment of the applicable indemnified
amount (after taking into account any Tax detriment arising from
indemnification hereunder and treating the applicable Tax item as the last
item to be used by the indemnified party). The parties hereto acknowledge that
it is not expected that Losses will give rise to US federal income Tax
benefits that will be subject to this _Section 9.4(g)_.

 



 

9.5 _Procedure for Indemnification_. The procedure for indemnification shall
be as follows:

 



 

(a) The Buyer Indemnified Party or the Seller Indemnified Party claiming
indemnification (the " **Claimant** ") shall give written notice to the party
from whom indemnification is sought (the " **Indemnifier** ") of any claim,
whether between the parties or brought by a third party, promptly after
receiving notice or becoming aware thereof, and such notice shall specify in
reasonable detail (i) the factual basis for such claim and (ii) the amount of
the claim; _provided,_ however, that any delay by the Claimant in giving such
notice shall not relieve the Indemnifier of its obligations under this
Agreement except and only to the extent that the Indemnifier is actually and
materially damaged by such delay.

 



 

(b) If such notice from the Claimant pertains to a claim or demand by a third
party (a " **Third Party Claim** ") then the Indemnifier shall have thirty
(30) days following receipt of the Claimants notice to (i) make such
investigation of the claim or demand as the Indemnifier deems necessary or
desirable and (ii) notify the Claimant of whether or not the Indemnifier
desires to defend the Claimant against such claim or demand. During such
thirty (30) day period, the Claimant shall make such filings, including
motions for continuance (and answers if a motion for continuance has not been
granted), as may be necessary to preserve the parties positions and rights
with respect to such claim or demand; _provided_ , _however_ , that any
failure by the Claimant to do so shall not relieve the Indemnifier of its
obligations under this Agreement except and only to the extent that the
Indemnifier is actually and materially damaged by such delay.

 



 

(c) The Indemnifier may elect to defend the Claimant against such Third Party
Claim or demand, and then the Indemnifier shall have the sole power to direct
and control such defense so long as the Indemnifier agrees that it will be
responsible for the full payment of such claim or demand. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, the Indemnifier shall not be entitled to direct or control the
defense of any Third Party Claim if (i) the Third Party Claim relates to or
arises in connection with any criminal Legal Action, (ii) the Third Party
Claim seeks an injunction or equitable relief against any Buyer Indemnified
Party or any Seller Indemnified Party (as applicable), (iii) the Third Party
Claim has or would reasonably be expected to result in Losses in excess of the
amounts available for indemnification pursuant to this _Section 9_, or (iv)
the Indemnifier has failed or is failing to defend in good faith the Third
Party Claim. Upon confirmation by the Indemnifier of its obligation to provide
indemnification and its desire to assume the defense to such claim or demand
on the terms set forth above, the Indemnifier shall not be liable to the
Claimant for any legal fees and expenses subsequently incurred by the
Claimant, subject to reimbursement for actual out-of-pocket expenses incurred
by the Claimant as the result of a request for cooperation or assistance

 



      
 

 



 

by the Indemnifier; _provided_ _,_ however, that if, in the reasonable opinion
of counsel to the Claimant, there exists a conflict of interest between the
Indemnifier and the Claimant, the Indemnifier shall be liable for the legal
fees and expenses of separate counsel to the Claimant. If the Claimant desires
to participate in, but not control, any such defense, it may do so at its sole
cost and expense; _provided_ , that in any action seeking an injunction or
decree, the effect of which would be to limit in any respect the future
activity of the Claimant, the Claimant shall be entitled to participate in the
defense of such action at the Indemnifiers expense. The Claimant shall not
settle, compromise, discharge or otherwise admit to any liability for any
claim or demand without the prior written consent of the Indemnifier (which
consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed). The Indemnifier shall
not settle, compromise, discharge or otherwise admit to any liability for any
claim or demand without the prior written consent of the Claimant (which
consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed). The Indemnifier shall
notify the Claimant promptly following any determination by the Indemnifier
that the tendered claim or demand is not subject to indemnification pursuant
to this _Section 9_; _provided_ _,_ however, that Indemnifier agrees that up
through the time of any such notification, it shall use its good faith and
commercially reasonable efforts to protect and preserve any rights of the
Claimant with respect to such claim or demand.

 



 

(d) If the Indemnifier elects not to defend the Claimant against such third
party claim or demand (or fails to promptly and reasonably prosecute such
defense), the Claimant shall have the right to defend the claim or demand
through appropriate proceedings and shall have the sole power to direct and
control such defense at the Indemnifiers sole cost and expense. The
Indemnifier shall have the right, at its sole cost and expense, to participate
in the defense or settlement of any third party claim for which it may be
liable, but Indemnifier shall be bound by the results or compromise obtained
by the Claimant with respect to such claim or demand (including any counter-
claim or third party cross-claim relating thereto).

 



 

9.6 _Exclusive Remedy_. Except (i) in the case of fraud, and (ii) in the case
where a party seeks to obtain specific performance pursuant to _Section
11.13_, from and after the Closing, the rights of the parties to
indemnification pursuant to the provisions of this _Section 9_ shall be the
sole and exclusive remedy for the parties hereto with respect to any matter in
any way arising from or relating to this Agreement or its subject matter;
provided, for the avoidance of doubt, that the foregoing shall not limit in
any way the rights of the parties under any other Transaction Document (it
being understood that the terms, conditions and limitations of the provisions
contained in this _Section 9_ apply to the Transaction Documents, other than
the Transition Services Agreements, the DTV Amendment, the Sports Rights
Agreement and the Consulting Agreement).

 



 

9.7 _Adjustments to Purchase Price_. All payments made with respect to the
rights of indemnity under _Section 9_ shall be treated as adjustments to the
Purchase Price for all Tax purposes.

 



      
 

 



 

 **SECTION 10 TAX MATTERS**

 



 

10.1 _Proration of Taxes_. All real and personal property and other ad valorem
Taxes and all rents, utilities and other charges against, or payable by the
owner of, any of the Assets relating to a time period beginning prior to, and
ending after, the Closing shall be prorated (based on the most recent
available tax statement, latest tax valuation and latest bills) as of the
Closing. Amounts relating to the period on or prior to the Closing Date shall
be allocated to and be the obligations of Seller, and amounts relating to the
period subsequent to the Closing Date shall be allocated to and be the
obligations of Buyer. If the Closing occurs before the tax rate is fixed for
the then current fiscal or calendar year, whichever is applicable, the
proration of the corresponding Taxes shall be estimated on the basis of the
tax rate for the last preceding year applied to the latest assessed valuation.
The Sellers estimated accrued liability (to the Closing) for any of the
above-described Taxes and charges that are due and payable after the Closing,
to the extent practicable, shall be made as a credit against the amount
payable at the Closing by the Buyer. To the extent the Seller or any its
Affiliates has paid or does pay any of the above-described Taxes and charges
relating to the period subsequent to the Closing Date, Buyer shall promptly
reimburse the Seller in full therefor (including, to the extent practicable,
as an addition to the amount payable at the Closing by the Buyer). As to those
prorations of Taxes and other charges which are not capable of being
ascertained on or prior to the Closing Date (or which were estimated on the
Closing Date), such prorations shall be payable by the Seller to the Buyer, or
by the Buyer to the Seller, as applicable, as an adjustment to the Purchase
Price within ninety (90) days of date on which the actual amounts become
known.

 



 

10.2 _Transfer Taxes_. All recordation, transfer and documentary taxes and
fees, stamps, and any excise, sales or use taxes, and all similar costs of
transferring the Assets in accordance with this Agreement shall be borne 50%
by the Seller and 50% by the Buyer.

 



 

 **SECTION 11 MISCELLANEOUS**

 



 

11.1 _Fees and Expenses_. Except as otherwise provided in this Agreement, each
party shall pay its own expenses incurred in connection with the
authorization, preparation, negotiation, execution and performance of this
Agreement, including all fees and expenses of attorneys, accountants, agents
and other representatives.

 



 

11.2 _Damages_. Except with respect to adjudicated Losses required to be paid
to a third party and notwithstanding anything else to the contrary set forth
herein, no party hereto shall be liable for any punitive, special,
consequential, incidental, indirect or exemplary damages or for lost profits,
opportunity or revenue; _provided_ , _however_ , that the parties shall be
entitled to consequential damages to the extent that they were reasonably
foreseeable based on the facts and circumstances giving rise or underlying the
applicable losses or damages.

 



      
 

 



 

11.3 _Notices_. All notices, demands, consents, referrals and requests

Seller, to (a) assign any or all of its rights and interests hereunder to one
or more of its Affiliates or (b) designate one or more of its Affiliates to

hereunder. Subject to the foregoing, this Agreement shall be binding upon and
inure to the benefit of the parties hereto and their successors and permitted
assigns. A transfer or assignment by the Buyer of all or any portion of the
Assets shall not affect the Buyers rights (including its rights to
indemnification pursuant to _Section 9_) under this Agreement or any of the
other Transaction Documents.

 



 

11.5 _Governing Law_. THIS AGREEMENT SHALL BE GOVERNED, CONSTRUED AND ENFORCED
IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE LAWS OF THE STATE OF DELAWARE, WITHOUT GIVING EFFECT TO
ANY PROVISIONS RELATING TO CONFLICTS OF LAWS.

 



 

11.6 _Venue_. The parties hereby agree that all Legal Actions (whether in
contract or tort) arising out of or relating to this Agreement, or the
negotiation, execution or performance of this Agreement (including any claim
or cause of action based upon, arising out of or related to any representation
or warranty made in or in connection with this Agreement or as an inducement
to enter into this Agreement), shall, unless otherwise agreed, be litigated
only in, and the parties hereto hereby agree and consent to be subject to the
jurisdiction of, the courts of the United States located in Delaware and in
the absence of such federal jurisdiction, the parties consent to be subject to
the jurisdiction of the courts of the State of Delaware. The parties hereto
irrevocably waive the defense of an inconvenient forum to the maintenance of
any such Legal Action. Each of the parties hereto further irrevocably consents
to the service of process out of any of the aforementioned courts in any such
Legal Action by the mailing of copies thereof by registered mail, postage
prepaid, to such party at its address set forth in this Agreement, such
service of process to be effective upon acknowledgment or rejection of receipt
of such registered mail. Nothing in this _Section 11.6_ shall affect the
right of any party hereto to serve legal process in any other manner permitted
by law. The consents to jurisdiction set forth in this _Section 11.6_ shall
not constitute general consents to service of process in the State of Delaware
and shall have no effect for any purpose except as provided in this _Section
11.6_.

 



 

11.7 _Waiver of Jury Trial_. Each party hereto hereby waives, to the fullest
extent permitted by applicable law, any right it may have to a trial by jury
in respect of any litigation arising out of or in connection with this
Agreement. Each party hereto (a) certifies that no representative, agent or
attorney of any other party has represented, expressly or otherwise, that such
other party would not, in the event of litigation, seek to enforce the
foregoing waiver and (b) acknowledges that it and the other

 



      
 

 



 

parties hereto have been induced to enter into this Agreement by, among other
things, the mutual waivers and certifications contained in this _Section
11.7_.

 



 

11.8 _Entire Agreement; Amendments_. This Agreement, the other Transaction
Documents, all Exhibits and Schedules to the Company Disclosure Letter hereto
and thereto and all documents and certificates to be delivered by the parties
pursuant hereto and thereto collectively represent the entire understanding
and agreement between the Buyer and the Seller with respect to the subject
matter hereof. All Exhibits and Schedules to the Company Disclosure Letter
attached to this Agreement shall be deemed part of this Agreement and are
incorporated herein, where applicable, as if fully set forth herein. This
Agreement supersedes all prior negotiations, letters of intent or other
writings between the Buyer and the Seller with respect to the subject matter
hereof, and cannot be amended, supplemented or modified except by a written
agreement which makes specific reference to this Agreement or an agreement
delivered pursuant hereto, as the case may be, and which is signed by the
party against which enforcement of any such amendment, supplement or
modification is sought.

 



 

11.9 _Waiver of Compliance; Consents_. Except as otherwise provided in this
Agreement any failure of any of the parties to comply with any obligation,
representation, warranty, covenant, agreement or condition herein may be
waived by the party entitled to the benefits thereof only by a written
instrument signed by the party granting such waiver, but such waiver or
failure to insist upon strict compliance with such obligation, representation,
warranty, covenant, agreement or condition shall not operate as a waiver.

 



 

11.10 _Severability_. If any provision hereof or the application thereof to
any Person or circumstance shall be invalid or unenforceable to any extent,
the remainder of this Agreement and the application of such provision to other
Persons or circumstances shall not be affected thereby and shall be enforced
to the greatest extent permitted by law.

 



 

11.11 _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be signed by the parties in one or
more counterparts, each of which when delivered to the other parties
(including via facsimile or e-mail portable document format (*.pdf)) will be
deemed to be an original copy of this Agreement and all of which, when taken
together, will be deemed to constitute one and the same Agreement.

 



 

11.12 _No Third Party Beneficiaries_. All rights and obligations created by
this Agreement are solely between the parties hereto. The parties hereto
intend that there are no third party beneficiaries under this Agreement,
except as specifically provided in _Section 9_. Without limiting the
foregoing, nothing in this Agreement is intended to confer upon any employee
of the Seller or such employees legal representatives, heirs or beneficiaries
any rights as a third party beneficiary or otherwise or any remedies of any
kind whatsoever under or by reason of this Agreement, or the transactions
contemplated hereby, including any rights of employment or continued
employment.

 



 

11.13 _Specific Performance_. Each of the parties hereto agrees that
irreparable damage would occur in the event that any of the provisions of this
Agreement

 



      
 

 



 

were not performed by them in accordance with the terms hereof or were
otherwise breached and that each party shall be entitled to an injunction or
injunctions to prevent breaches of the provisions hereof and to specific
performance of the terms hereof, in addition to any other remedy at law or
equity. The taking of any such action by the parties in one or more
jurisdictions shall not preclude the taking of any such action in any other
jurisdiction (whether concurrently or not) if and to the extent permitted by
Legal Requirement.
