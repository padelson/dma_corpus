(c) the amount to be paid in cash by Buyer to Seller at Closing (the "Closing
Payment"), which shall equal the sum of (i) the Base Purchase Price _plus_
(ii) the Closing Adjustment. Seller shall prepare the Estimated Closing
Statement in accordance with the Transaction Accounting Principles. Following
the delivery by Seller of the Estimated Closing Statement, upon reasonable
prior notice to Seller, Buyer and its Representatives shall be given such
reasonable access during normal business hours to those books and records of
Seller and the Acquired Companies and, if required by Seller, with
supervision of Seller or its Representatives, access to such personnel or
Representatives of Seller or the Acquired Companies reasonably related to
Sellers preparation of the Estimated Closing Statement as Buyer may
reasonably request for the purposes of evaluating the calculation of the
Estimated Closing Statement; _provided_ , that such access does not
unreasonably interfere with the conduct of the business of Seller or the
Acquired Companies. Seller shall consider in good faith any of Buyers
comments to the Estimated Closing Statement if provided by Buyer reasonably in
advance of Closing.

 



37 Section 2.06 _Post-_ _Closing_ _Adjustment Reconciliation Process_.

(a) _Delivery of Initial Post-_ _Closing_ _Statement by_ _Buyer_. No later
than sixty (60) days after the Closing Date, Buyer shall deliver to Seller: a
statement (the "Initial Post-Closing Statement"), in the same format as the
Reference Closing Statement, setting forth Buyers calculation of the Closing
Net Working Capital, Target Working Capital and Closing Cash as of the
Effective Time, and of the Closing Transaction Expenses and Closing
Indebtedness as of the Closing. Buyer shall prepare the Initial Post-Closing
Statement in good faith and in accordance with the Transaction Accounting
Principles. The parties acknowledge that the sole purpose of the determination
of the process in this _Section_ __ _ 2.06_ is to determine the Final Closing
Net Working Capital, Final Target Working Capital, Final Closing Cash, Final
Closing Indebtedness and Final Closing Transaction Expenses and such process
is not intended to permit the introduction of different judgments, accounting
methods, policies, principles, practices, procedures, classifications or
estimation methodologies in a manner inconsistent with the Transaction
Accounting Principles.

(b) _Review of Initial Post-Closing Statement_ _by_ _Seller_. Seller shall
have sixty (60) days after the date on which it receives the Initial Post-
Closing Statement to review the Initial Post-Closing Statement and the
calculation set forth therein (the "Review Period"). To facilitate such
review, during the Review Period, Buyer shall, and shall cause the Acquired
Companies to, upon reasonable prior notice, provide Seller and its
Representatives with reasonable access, during normal business hours, to the
employees of Buyer and the Acquired Companies (including to the Chief
Financial Officer of Buyer) responsible for the calculations set forth in the
Initial Post-Closing Statement and to all non-privileged documentation, books,
records and other information of Buyer and the Acquired Companies which is
reasonably related to the preparation of the Initial Post-Closing Statement
and Sellers review thereof as Seller or any of its Representatives may
reasonably request (including Buyers work papers relating to the Initial
Post-Closing Statement, subject to the Seller and its applicable
Representatives delivering customary agreement relating to such access to
work papers in form and substance reasonably acceptable to the applicable
accountants, if applicable); _provided_ , that such access does not
unreasonably interfere with the conduct of the business of Buyer or
the Acquired Companies. If Seller does not deliver a Dispute Notice to Buyer
with respect to any item in the Initial Post-Closing Statement on or prior to
the last day of the Review Period, the amount or calculation with respect to
such items as set forth in the Initial Post-Closing Statement shall be deemed
accepted by Seller, whereupon the amount or calculation of such item or items
shall be final and binding on Seller and Buyer.

 

(c) _Dispute Notice_. If Seller disagrees with the Initial Post-Closing
Statement (including any amount or calculation set forth therein) in any
respect and on any basis, Seller may, on or prior to the last day of the
Review Period, deliver a notice to Buyer setting forth, in reasonable detail,
each disputed item or amount and the basis for Sellers disagreement therewith
(the "Dispute Notice"). The Dispute Notice shall set forth, with respect to
each disputed item, Sellers position as to the correct amount or calculation
that should have been included in the Initial Post-Closing Statement.

 

(d) _Consultation_. For a period of thirty (30) days beginning on the date on
which Buyer receives a Dispute Notice (the "Consultation Period"), if any,
Buyer and Seller shall endeavor in good faith to resolve by mutual agreement
all matters identified in the Dispute Notice.

 



38 (e) _Independent Accounting Firm_. In the event Buyer and Seller are unable to
resolve by mutual agreement any matter identified in the Dispute Notice
within the Consultation Period, Buyer or Seller shall engage an independent,
nationally-recognized certified public accounting firm or valuation firm in
the United States mutually acceptable to Seller and Buyer (the "Independent
Accounting Firm") to make a determination with respect to all of such matters
still in dispute at the time of submission. If Buyer and Seller are unable to
agree upon such a firm within ten (10) Business Days after the end of the
Consultation Period, then within an additional ten (10) Business Days, Buyer
and Seller shall each select one such firm and those two firms shall select a
third such firm, in which event the Independent Accounting Firm shall be such
third firm. The fees and expenses of the Independent Accounting Firm shall be
borne by Seller, on the one hand, and Buyer, on the other hand,
proportionately based on the determination by the Independent Accounting Firm
of the matters submitted to it pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 2.06(f)_. The
calculation of such proportionate payments shall be based on the relative
position of the determination of the Independent Accounting Firm
in comparison to the positions submitted to it pursuant to this _Section_ __
_ 2.06_. All other fees and expenses incurred by Buyer or Seller in
connection with the preparation or review of the Initial Post-Closing
Statement or the Dispute Notice shall be borne by the party incurring such
fees and expenses.

(f) _Dispute Resolution Procedure_. Buyer and Seller shall direct the
Independent Accounting Firm to render a determination within sixty (60) days
after its retention, and shall, and shall cause their respective
Representatives to, reasonably cooperate with the Independent Accounting Firm
during its engagement in connection with this Agreement. Each of Buyer and
Seller shall promptly (and in any event within ten (10) Business Days) after
the Independent Accounting Firms engagement, submit to the Independent
Accounting Firm its calculations of the disputed items submitted to the
Independent Accounting Firm for determination pursuant to _Section_ __ _
2.06(g)_ and information, arguments and support for their respective
positions, and shall concurrently deliver a copy of such materials to the
other party (provided that the amounts submitted shall be no more favorable to
the submitting party than those reflected in the Initial Post-Closing
Statement or Dispute Notice, as applicable). Each party shall then be given
an opportunity to supplement the information, arguments and support included
in its initial submission with one additional submission to respond to any
arguments or positions taken by the other party in such other partys initial
submission, which supplemental information shall be submitted to the
Independent Accounting Firm (with a copy thereof to the other party) within
five (5) Business Days after the first date on which both parties have
submitted their respective initial submissions to the Independent Accounting
Firm (provided that the amounts submitted shall be no more favorable to the
submitting party than those reflected in the initial submission of such
party). The Independent Accounting Firm shall thereafter be permitted to
request additional or clarifying information from the parties, and each of the
parties shall reasonably cooperate and shall cause their Representatives to
reasonably cooperate with such requests of the Independent Accounting Firm.
The Independent Accounting Firm shall determine, acting as an expert and not
as an arbitrator, based solely on the materials so presented by the parties
and upon information received in response to such requests for additional
or clarifying information and not by independent review, only those disputed
items submitted to it pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 2.06(f)_ and shall
render a written report to Buyer and Seller (the "Adjustment Report") in
which the Independent Accounting Firm shall, after considering all disputed
items submitted to it pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 2.06(f)_, make a final
determination, binding on the parties to this Agreement, of the appropriate
amount of each of the disputed items submitted to it pursuant to this
_Section_ __ _ 2.06(f)_. During the review by the

 



39  Independent Accounting Firm, Buyer and Seller and their respective
accountants will each make available to the Independent Accounting Firm
interviews with such individuals, and such information, books and records and
work papers, as may be reasonably required by the Independent Accounting Firm
to fulfill its obligations under this _Section_ __ _ 2.06_ and preparing and
rendering the Adjustment Report; _provided_ ,  _however_ , that the
accountants of Seller, any of its Affiliates or Buyer or any of its Affiliates
shall not be obliged to make any work papers available to the Independent
Accounting Firm except in accordance with such accountants normal disclosure
procedures and then only after the Independent Accounting Firm has signed a
customary agreement relating to such access to work papers in form and
substance reasonably acceptable to such accountants.

 

(g) _Adjustment Report_. The Adjustment Report shall set forth, in reasonable
detail, the Independent Accounting Firms determination with respect to each
of the disputed items submitted to it pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 2.06(f)_,
and the revisions, if any, to be made to the Initial Post-Closing Statement,
together with supporting calculations. In resolving any disputed item, the
Independent Accounting Firm (i) shall be bound to the principles of this
_Section_ __ _ 2.06_ and the terms of this Agreement, (ii) shall limit its
review to matters specifically submitted to it pursuant to _Section_ __ _
2.06(f)_ and (iii) shall not assign a value to any item higher than the
highest value for such item claimed by either party or less than the lowest
value for such item claimed by either party. The Adjustment Report, absent
fraud, shall be final and binding upon Buyer and Seller. For the avoidance of
doubt, the Independent Accounting Firm shall not have the authority to resolve
issues relating to (i) breaches of representations, warranties, covenants or
agreements, or (ii) other claims that are not within the scope of the disputed
matters specifically submitted to it pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 2.06(f)_.

 

(h) _Final Amounts._ The Closing Net Working Capital as of the Effective Time,
Target Working Capital as of the Effective Time, Closing Cash as of the
Effective Time, Closing Indebtedness as of the Closing and Closing Transaction
Expenses as of the Closing that are final and binding on the parties to this
Agreement, as determined through agreement or inaction of the parties to
this Agreement or through the action of the Independent Accounting Firm
pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 2.06_ are referred to herein, respectively,
as the "Final Closing Net Working Capital," "Final Target Working Capital,"
"Final Closing Cash," "Final Closing Indebtedness" and "Final Closing
Transaction Expenses."

 

Section 2.07 _Post-_ _Closing_ _Adjustment_ _Payment_. For purposes of this
Agreement, "Post-Closing Difference" means the amount (expressed either as a
positive or negative number, as applicable) of (a) an amount equal to (i) the
sum of the Final Closing Net Working Capital Adjustment (which may be a
negative number) and Final Closing Cash _minus_ (ii) the Final Closing
Indebtedness _minus_ Final Closing Transaction Expenses _minus_ (b) an amount
equal to (i) the sum of the Estimated Closing Net Working Capital Adjustment
(which may be a negative number) and Estimated Closing Cash _minus_ (ii)
Estimated Closing Indebtedness _minus_ (iii) Estimated Closing Transaction
Expenses. If the Post-Closing Difference is equal to $0, no payment shall be
made pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 2.07_. If the Post-Closing Difference
is a positive number, then Buyer shall pay in cash to the Seller the amount of
the Post-Closing Difference. If the Post-Closing Difference is a negative
number, then Seller shall pay in cash to Buyer the absolute value of the
amount of the Post-Closing Difference. Any such payment (the "Post-Closing
Adjustment") shall be made within five (5) Business Days after the Final
Closing Net Working Capital, Final Closing Cash,

 



40  Final Closing Indebtedness and Final Closing Transaction Expenses are
finally determined as contemplated by _Section_ __ _ 2.06(h)_ and payable in
cash in accordance with  _Section_ __ _ 2.10_. Any amount paid in respect of
the Post-Closing Adjustment shall be treated by the parties as an adjustment
to the Base Purchase Price (as adjusted) for Tax purposes, unless otherwise
required by applicable Law.

Section 2.08 _Payment of_ _Long-Term AR_. Buyer shall reasonably cooperate
with Seller (at Sellers sole cost and expense) to assist Seller in the
collection of the Long-Term AR. If Buyer or any of its Subsidiaries receives
any amount in respect of the Long-Term Term AR, Buyer shall or shall cause
such Subsidiary to pay as promptly as reasonably practicable following the
receipt of such amounts, net of any Tax incurred in connection with the
receipt of such amounts or required to be withheld on payment.

 

Section 2.09 _Transferred Engagements_. Within two weeks following the date
hereof, Seller shall deliver to Buyer  _Schedule 2.09_, which shall set
forth those Transferred Engagements which are identified in Sellers systems
as active. No earlier than ten (10) Business Days and later than five (5)
Business Days prior to the anticipated Closing Date, Seller shall deliver to
Buyer an update to Schedule 2.09, which shall set forth such information as
updated as of the Business Day prior to the date of delivery.

 

Section 2.10 _Payments and Computations_. Each party shall make each payment
due under this Agreement to the other party as early as practicable on the
day when due. All payments (including the Closing Payment) shall be paid by
wire transfer in immediately available funds to the account or accounts
designated in advance by the party receiving such payment. Whenever any
payment under this Agreement shall be due on a day other than a Business Day,
such payment shall be made on the next succeeding Business Day.

 

Section 2.11 _Allocation of Purchase Price_. No later than sixty (60) days
after the date of the determination of the Post-Closing Difference, Buyer
shall prepare and deliver to Seller a draft of an allocation statement (the
"Allocation Statement") setting forth its proposed allocation of the purchase
price for federal income tax purposes (including the Base Purchase Price (as
adjusted), the amount of Assumed Liabilities, the Liabilities of the Acquired
Companies and any other relevant amounts) among the Transferred Assets and the
assets of the Acquired Companies, and including a determination of the
"aggregate deemed asset disposition price" (within the meaning of Treasury
Regulation Section 1.336-3) ("ADADP") with respect to each of Navigant
Consulting (PI-NY) Inc. and PACE Claim Services, LLC and an allocation of the
applicable ADADP among their respective assets. The Allocation Statement shall
be reasonable and shall be prepared in accordance with Sections 1060 and
336(e) of the Code and the Treasury Regulations promulgated thereunder. If
within forty-five (45) days after Sellers receipt of the draft Allocation
Statement, Seller agrees in writing to such draft Allocation Statement, then
the Allocation Statement shall be final and binding on the parties hereto,
and Buyer, Seller and their respective Affiliates shall file all Tax Returns
in a manner consistent with such agreed allocation. In the event that Seller
objects in writing to the draft Allocation Statement within such forty-five
(45) day period, Seller and Buyer shall negotiate in good faith to resolve the
dispute. If Buyer and Seller are unable to resolve any such dispute within
such period, then Buyer and Seller shall submit such dispute to the
Independent Accounting Firm, which dispute shall be resolved pursuant to the
procedures set forth in _Section_ __ _ 2.06(e)_ and _(f)_.

 



41 Section 2.12 _Withholding_. Buyer and its Affiliates (including the Acquired
Companies) shall not withhold any amounts in respect of Taxes from payments
made pursuant to this Agreement unless required by applicable Law or a Tax
Authority. Buyer shall provide Seller with three (3) days prior written notice
of its intent to so withhold (other than with respect to any withholding
relating to amounts treated as compensation to current or former employees for
Tax purposes or Sellers failure to deliver the applicable certificate under 
_Section_ __ _ 3.04(d)_), and consider in good faith any forms or other
evidence timely provided by Seller to Buyer that would reduce or eliminate
such withholding. To the extent that amounts are so deducted and withheld and
paid over to the appropriate Taxing Authority, such amounts shall be treated
for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the Person to whom
such amounts would otherwise have been paid.

(a) _Deferred_ _NCA Closing_ _Generally_. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary in this Agreement, (i) Seller and Buyer agree that written approval

condition to the Closing and that no agreement with FINRA or any other
Governmental Authority or Governmental Order that has the effect of
restraining or prohibiting the direct or indirect purchase and sale of the
Equity Interests of NCA (the "NCA Equity Interests") shall cause a failure of
the conditions set forth in  _Section_ __ _ 11.01(c)_ __ or _Section_ __ _
11.02(c)_ to be satisfied and (ii) in the event that (A) the FINRA Approval
has not been received by the parties and the parties have not

amount of Regulatory Capital required under Rule 15c3-1 of the Exchange Act as
of the date hereof, then, notwithstanding the occurrence of the Closing, the
closing of the direct or indirect purchase by Buyer of the NCA Equity
Interests shall be postponed to a date following the Closing Date that is no
later than six (6) months after the Closing Date (the "Outside Deferred
Closing Date") unless otherwise agreed in writing by Seller and Buyer. Seller
and Buyer further agree that upon the receipt by the parties prior to the
Outside Deferred Closing Date of the FINRA Approval without imposition of any
FINRA Approval Restriction, or at such other time as agreed in writing by
Seller and Buyer, Seller and Buyer shall hold a closing with respect to the
NCA Equity Interests (such closing, the "Deferred BD Closing" and the date on
which such Deferred BD Closing is actually held is referred to herein as the
"Deferred BD Closing Date"); _provided_ that, the Deferred BD Closing Date
shall occur no later than the third (3rd) Business Day after the date on
which such FINRA Approval has been received by the parties, or at such earlier
time as agreed in writing by Seller and Buyer. For the avoidance of doubt (1)
in the event of any of _clauses (A)_ or _(B)_ of this _Section_ __ _
3.05(a)_, the legal interest in and to the NCA Equity Interests shall not be
sold, transferred, conveyed or delivered directly or indirectly to Buyer
unless and until the Deferred BD Closing occurs and (2) the Closing Date

Equity Interests and there shall be no change in the amount paid at the
Closing pursuant to  _Section_ __ _ 3.02_ as a result of the Deferred BD

FINRA Approval, as applicable, as promptly as practicable and (iii) until the
earlier of the Deferred BD Closing and the Outside Deferred Closing Date,
except (A) as expressly contemplated by this Agreement, (B) with the prior
written approval of Buyer (not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed) or (C)
as may be required to comply with any applicable requirements of Law, (1)
Seller shall use its reasonable best efforts (x) to operate NCA in the
ordinary course and substantially as operated immediately prior to the date of
this Agreement (provided that NCA shall operate solely for the benefit of the
Business and the Buyer Affiliates) and (y) to preserve the goodwill of the
suppliers, contractors, licensors, employees, customers, clients, distributors
and others having business relations with NCA and (2) Seller and Buyer will
cooperate in a mutually agreeable arrangement under which Buyer would, in
compliance with requirements of Law, obtain the benefits and assume the
obligations and bear the economic burdens associated with NCA in accordance
with this Agreement (other than any obligations or economic burdens resulting
from a breach of this Agreement by Seller and without allocating any corporate
level expenses of Seller or any Subsidiary to NCA) (it being understood that,
to the extent required by Law, any revenues associated with NCA shall not be
paid over to Buyer prior to the Deferred BD Closing and rather will be held
for Buyers benefit by Seller (such amounts, the "Interim BD Revenues"));
_provided_ , _however_ , that (1) Seller and its Affiliates shall have no
obligation to make any investment in, or to make any loan or other capital
contribution to, NCA, except to the extent necessary to meet the Regulatory
Capital requirements of NCA in effect on the date hereof or as modified by
the SEC or FINRA after the date hereof through the Deferred BD Closing Date,
and (2) "ordinary course" operations that are "substantially as operated
immediately prior to the date of this Agreement" 

 



44  shall not be the same as prior to the Closing Date (by sole reason of the
transactions consummated on the Closing Date pursuant to the Transaction
Agreements and the impact thereof) and neither Seller nor any of its
Affiliates shall have any responsibility to, or liability for, failure to
operate NCA in the ordinary course, substantially as operated immediately
prior to the date of this Agreement, by reason of any change solely from
the transactions consummated on the Closing Date pursuant to the Transaction
Agreements.

(c) _Deferred Closing Mechanics_. At the Deferred BD Closing and conditioned
thereon, Seller shall deliver to Buyer customary evidence of ownership of the
NCA Equity Interests and the transfer thereof to Buyer and Buyer shall pay
Seller an amount equal to the Sellers cost to fund the ongoing operations of
NCA from and after the Closing Date until the occurrence of the Deferred BD
Closing (without allocating any corporate level expenses of Seller or any
Subsidiary to NCA), including the amount of any contribution to capital
made by Seller or its Affiliate to NCA necessary to meet any increase in the
Regulatory Capital requirements of NCA occurring after the Closing Date.
Neither Seller nor any of its Affiliates makes any representation or warranty
of any kind whatsoever, whether express or implied, at law or in equity, with
respect to NCA except as set forth in _Article_ __ _ V_.

(d)  _Winddown_. In the event that either the Deferred BD Closing does not
occur on or before the Outside Deferred Closing Date, (x) then all obligations
of Buyer and its Affiliates and Seller and its Affiliates under this 
_Section_ __ _ 3.05_ with respect to NCA shall cease immediately upon the
Outside Deferred Closing Date, and as of such date, Seller, in its sole
discretion, shall have the right to commence the winding down of NCA in a
manner that Seller deems reasonable and (y) Seller shall pay the amount of
the Interim BD Revenues to Buyer as an adjustment to final purchase price paid
by Buyer pursuant to this Agreement.

(a) Seller is a corporation duly incorporated and validly existing under the
Laws of the State of Delaware. Seller is in good standing under the Laws of

Business Transferor is a corporation or other legal entity duly incorporated
or organized, validly existing and in good standing under the Laws of the
jurisdiction in which it is

 



45  incorporated or organized (in the case of good standing, to the extent such

material adverse effect on the Business, taken as a whole, or prevent or
materially delay the consummation of the Closing.

 

(b) Each of Seller and the Business Transferors has all requisite corporate or
other entity power to enter into, consummate the transactions contemplated
by, and carry out its obligations under, each of the Transaction Agreements to

Business Transferor of the Transaction Agreements to which it is or will be
a party, and the consummation by Seller and each Business Transferor of the
transactions contemplated by, and the performance by Seller and each Business
Transferor of its obligations under, such Transaction Agreements have been

other Transaction Agreements will be, duly executed and delivered by Seller
and each Business Transferor, and this Agreement constitutes, and upon
execution and delivery of the other Transaction Agreements to which
Seller and each Business Transferor is or will be a party, such other
Transaction Agreements will constitute (assuming due authorization, execution
and delivery by each other party to such Transaction Agreement), the legal,
valid and binding obligation of Seller and each Business Transferor,
enforceable against Seller and each Business Transferor in accordance with its
terms, subject to the effect of any applicable bankruptcy, reorganization,
insolvency, moratorium, rehabilitation, liquidation, fraudulent conveyance or
similar Laws relating to or affecting creditors rights generally and subject,
as to enforceability, to the effect of general equitable principles
(regardless of whether such enforceability is considered in a proceeding in
equity or at law).

authorizations and other actions described in _Section_ __ _ 4.03_ have been
obtained or taken, except as set forth in Section 4.02 of the Seller
Disclosure Schedule and except as may result from any facts or circumstances
solely relating to Buyer or its Affiliates (as opposed to any Third Party),
the execution, delivery and performance by Seller, the Business Transferors
and the Acquired Companies of, and the consummation by Seller, the Business
Transferors and the Acquired Companies of the transactions contemplated by,

REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES

 

REGARDING THE ACQUIRED COMPANIES,

 

THE TRANSFERRED ASSETS AND THE BUSINESS

 

Except as set forth (a) in the Seller SEC Documents (other than (x) any
disclosures contained or referenced therein under the captions "Risk Factors"
or "Forward-Looking Statements" and any other disclosures that are predictive,
cautionary or forward-looking in nature, and (y) in each case, any matters
required to be disclosed for purposes of  _Section_ __ _ 5.04_) or (b)
subject to _Section_ __ _ 14.10_, the sections or subsections of the Seller
Disclosure Schedule corresponding to the respective sections or sub-sections
of this _Article_ __ _ V_, Seller hereby represents and warrants to Buyer as
of the date of this Agreement and as of the Closing:

 

Section 5.01 _Incorporation and Authority of the_ _Acquired Companies_.

 

(a) Each Acquired Company is a corporation or other legal entity duly
incorporated or organized, validly existing under the Laws of
the jurisdiction in which it is incorporated or organized. Each Acquired
Company is duly qualified as a foreign entity to do business and is in good
standing in each jurisdiction where the character of its owned, operated or
leased properties or the nature of its activities makes such qualification
necessary (in the case of good standing, to the extent such jurisdiction
recognizes such concept), except for jurisdictions where the failures to be so
qualified or in good standing, individually or in the aggregate, would not
reasonably be expected to have a Company Material Adverse Effect. Each
Acquired Company has the requisite entity power and authority to hold its
property and assets and to conduct its business as now conducted,
except where the failures to have such entity power and authority,
individually or in the aggregate, would not reasonably be expected to,
individually or in the aggregate, have a material and adverse effect on the
Business or the Acquired Companies, taken as a whole.

 



47 (b) Each Transferred Company, and as of Closing, each of the Companies, has
all requisite power, authority and capacity to enter into, consummate the
transactions contemplated by, and carry out its obligations under, each of the
Transaction Agreements to which such Person is or will be a party. The
execution and delivery by each of the Acquired Companies, of the Transaction
Agreements to which such Person is or will be a party, and the consummation by
each such Person of the transactions contemplated by, and the performance by
each such Person of its obligations under, such Transaction Agreements have
been duly authorized by all requisite corporate action on the part of such
Person. Upon execution and delivery of the Transaction Agreements to which an
Acquired Company is or will be a party, such Transaction Agreements will be
duly executed and delivered by such Person, and (assuming due authorization,
execution and delivery by each other party to such Transaction Agreements)
such Transaction Agreements will constitute, the legal, valid and binding
obligation of such Person, enforceable against it in accordance with its
terms, subject to the effect of any applicable bankruptcy, reorganization,
insolvency, moratorium, rehabilitation, liquidation, fraudulent conveyance or
similar Laws relating to or affecting creditors rights generally and
subject, as to enforceability, to the effect of general equitable principles
(regardless of whether such enforceability is considered in a proceeding in
equity or at law).

 

(c) Seller has made available to Buyer true and complete copies of the
certificate of formation, operating agreement or similar
organizational documents and any amendments thereto of each Acquired Company,
as in effect as of the date hereof, and no Acquired Company is or has been in
material violation of its organizational documents.

 

Section 5.02 _Capital Structure of the_ _Companies_ _and the_ _Transferred
Companies_ _; Ownership and Transfer of the_ _Equity Interests_ _and the
Acquired Interests_.

(a) The holders of record of the Equity Interests and the Acquired Interests
as of the date hereof, as of immediately following the Reorganization and
immediately prior to the Closing, are as set forth on Section 5.02(a) of the
Seller Disclosure Schedules (subject to Section 3.05 with respect to any
NCA Equity Interests). Except as provided in Section 5.02(a) of the Seller
Disclosure Schedules, there are no other issued and outstanding equity
securities of any Acquired Company. Other than the Acquired Interests, all of
which are held by Seller, there are no other issued and outstanding equity
securities of the Companies. The Equity Interests and the Acquired Interests
have been duly authorized and validly issued and are fully paid (in the case
of jurisdictions where such concept is recognized) and were not issued in
violation of any applicable securities laws, preemptive, call option, right of
first refusal or subscription rights under the organizational documents of, or
otherwise applicable to, the Acquired Company with respect to such interests.
There are no options, warrants or rights of conversion or rights of first
refusal, preemptive right or other rights, agreements, arrangements,
understandings or commitments of any kind other rights of any
character, written or oral, obligating any Acquired Company to issue or sell
any of its equity securities or securities convertible into or exchangeable
for its equity securities, or any other interests in the Acquired Company.
There are no equity appreciation rights, phantom equity plans, securities
with profit participation rights or features, or similar obligations or
commitments of any of the Acquired Companies, respectively. Except for this
Agreement, there are no voting trusts, equityholder agreements, proxies or
other rights or agreements in effect with respect to the voting, transfer or
distribution rights of the equity securities of any of the Acquired Companies.

 



48 (b) No Acquired Company has any authorized or outstanding bonds, debentures,
notes or other Indebtedness having voting rights (or convertible into or
exchangeable for securities having voting rights).

(c) The Equity Interests are owned, beneficially and of record and free and
clear of all Liens (other than those arising under applicable securities Laws,
those arising as a result of this Agreement and any Buyer Liens), by an Equity
Transferor, and as of Closing, directly or indirectly by Thoreau Holdco or
NCE, as applicable, in accordance with _Section_ __ _ 5.02(a)_ of the Seller
Disclosure Schedules. The Acquired Interests are owned, beneficially and of
record free and clear of all Liens (other than those arising under applicable
securities Laws, those in favor of Buyer arising as a result of this Agreement
and any Buyer Liens), by Seller.

 

(d) Other than another Acquired Company, no Acquired Company owns any equity
interests in any other Person

 

Section 5.03 _Financial Statements_ _; Absence of Undisclosed Liabilities_.

 

(a) The Business is not a separately reported unit of Seller. As a result, the
financial statements prepared for the Business are not prepared as part of
Sellers normal reporting process. _Section_ __ _ 5.03(a)_ of the Seller
Disclosure Schedule sets forth (i) the unaudited, combined pro forma (giving
effect to the Reorganization) statement of assets and liabilities of the
Business at December 31, 2017 and the related unaudited, combined pro forma
(giving effect to the Reorganization) statement of earnings of the Business
for the year then ended and (ii) the unaudited, combined pro forma (giving
effect to the Reorganization) statement of assets and liabilities of the
Business at March 31, 2018 (the "Reference Balance Sheet") and the related
unaudited, pro forma (giving effect to the Reorganization) statement
of earnings of the Business for the three (3)-month period then ended (the
balance sheets and statements referred to in _clauses _ _(i)_ and _(ii)_
being herein collectively referred to as the "Financial Statements"), which
in each case, have been compiled by management of the Seller from source
documentation subject to the controls and procedures of Sellers accounting
systems. The books, records and other financial reports of Seller relating to
the operations of the Business used by Seller as source documentation for the
Financial Statements are correct in all material respects and have been
maintained in accordance with sound business practices. Except as set forth
in  _Section_ __ _ 5.03(a)_ of the Seller Disclosure Schedules, the
Financial Statements do not materially misstate and fairly present in all
material respects the financial condition and results of operations of the
Business at their respective dates and for the periods covered by such
statements, subject to certain adjustments described therein and subject to
the omission of footnotes, but do not reflect what the consolidated results of
operations and financial positions would have been if the Business had been
operated independently of the Retained Business during the periods presented.
Seller maintains a system of internal accounting controls designed to provide
reasonable assurances regarding the reliability of financial reporting,
including that (A) transactions are executed in accordance with managements
general or specific authorizations, (B) transactions are recorded as necessary
to permit materially correct preparation of their combined financial
statements in accordance with GAAP consistently applied, and to maintain
reasonably accurate accountability for their assets, and (C) access to assets
is permitted only in accordance with managements general or
specific authorization.

 



49 (b) Except (i) as set forth in _Section_ __ _ 5.03(b)_ of the
Seller Disclosure Schedule or as set forth on the face of, or reserved
against on, the Reference Balance Sheet, (ii) for Liabilities incurred in the
ordinary course of business consistent with past practice since the date of
the Reference Balance Sheet (none of which is a Liability resulting from
breach of or default under any Contract, breach of warranty, tort, fraud,
infringement or misappropriation), (iii) for Excluded Liabilities, (iv) for
Liabilities relating to future performance under the Transferred Contracts,
the Transferred Leases or any other Contracts to which an Acquired Company is
a party in accordance with the terms of such Transferred Contracts, such
Transferred Leases or such other Contracts to which an Acquired Company is a
party, (v) for Liabilities incurred in connection with the transactions
contemplated under this Agreement or the Transaction Agreements, (vi) for
Liabilities for Taxes for which Buyer is indemnified under this Agreement
and (vii) for Liabilities that would not be, individually or in the
aggregate, material to the Business and the Acquired Companies, taken as a
whole, there are no Liabilities of the Business or the Acquired Companies
(whether accrued, absolute, contingent or otherwise).

Section 5.04 _Absence of Certain Changes_. Except as set forth in  _Section_
__ _ 5.04_ of the Seller Disclosure Schedule or as required by this Agreement
(including as contemplated with respect to the Reorganization), from January
1, 2018 to the date of this Agreement, (a) the Asset Transferors and the
Acquired Companies have conducted the Business in all material respects in the
ordinary course and consistent with past practices, (b) there has not occurred
a Company Material Adverse Effect and (c) none of Seller, the Asset
Transferors or the Acquired Companies or any of its other Subsidiaries with
respect to the Business, has taken any action or failed to take any action
that, if taken or failed to be taken after the date hereof without the consent
of Buyer, would constitute a breach of _Sections 7.01(b)(ii)_ , _(iii)_ ,
_(iv)_ , _(v)_ , _(vi)_ , _(vii)_ , _(viii)_ (solely to the extent other than
in the ordinary course of business), (ix)(A), _(x)_ , _(xi)_ ,  _(xii)_
through (xix) or, with respect to the foregoing, _(xx)_ had such Section been
in effect from December 31, 2017 to the date of this Agreement.

inquiries threatened against any Asset Transferor (to the extent arising from
or relating to the Business) or any Acquired Company; or (ii) Actions pending
as of the date hereof solely with respect to the Business that were
initiated by Seller (to the extent arising from or relating to the Business)
or any of its Subsidiaries (including the Acquired Companies) that, in the
case of _clauses_ _(i)_ or _(ii)_ would reasonably be expected to result in
award of damages against the defendants therein in excess of $500,000.

 



50 (b) As of the date hereof, there are no Actions pending or, to the Knowledge
of Seller as of the date hereof, threatened against Seller or any of its

into any of the Transaction Agreements or which would reasonably be expected
to adversely affect such partys performance under this Agreement or any of
the other Transaction Agreements to which such is a party or the consummation
of the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby.

similar state law. Except as disclosed on NCAs Form BD, as amended, or the

on such Form BD or Form U-4s, as applicable, and, as of the date hereof, no
such material Action (or to the Knowledge of Seller, investigation, formal
inquiry, investigation or charge) is pending or, to the Knowledge of Seller as
of the date hereof, threatened in writing.

 

(d) NCA has made available to the Buyer a complete copy of its Form BD as most

FOCUS Reports and all other material filings required by any Governmental
Authority required to be filed prior to the date hereof (collectively, and
including the forms and agreements referred to in this _Section_ __ _

Broker Regulatory Reports were true and correct in all material respects and

Governmental Authority with respect to such Broker Regulatory Reports. All

Acquired Company to serve in any capacity with respect to an offering under
such an exemption.

 

Section 5.21 _Insurance_. Section 5.21 of the Seller Disclosure Schedule sets

the Contract with such client.

good standing under the Laws of Delaware. Each Buyer Party is a corporation
or other legal entity duly incorporated or organized, validly existing and in

(b) Each of Buyer and each Buyer Party has all requisite corporate power to
enter into, consummate the transactions contemplated by, and carry out its
obligations under, each of the Transaction Agreements to which Buyer and each
Buyer Party is or will be a party (the "Buyer Transaction Agreements"). The

Agreements, the consummation by Buyer and each Buyer Party of the transactions
contemplated by, and the performance by Buyer and each Buyer Party of its
obligations under, the Buyer Transaction Agreements have been (or will be
prior to the Closing) duly authorized by all requisite corporate action on the
part of Buyer and each Buyer Party. This Agreement has been, and upon
execution and delivery, the other Buyer Transaction Agreements will be, duly
executed and delivered by Buyer and each Buyer Party, and (assuming due
authorization, execution and delivery by Seller) this Agreement constitutes,
and upon execution and delivery thereof, each of the other Buyer Transaction
Agreements will constitute (assuming due authorization, execution and dealing
by each other party to such Buyer Transaction Agreements) the legal, valid and
binding obligation of Buyer and each Buyer Party, enforceable against Buyer
and each Buyer Party in accordance with its terms, subject to the effect of
any applicable bankruptcy, reorganization, insolvency, moratorium,
rehabilitation, liquidation, fraudulent conveyance or similar Laws relating to
or affecting creditors rights generally and subject, as to enforceability,
to the effect of general equitable principles (regardless of whether such
enforceability is considered in a proceeding in equity or at law).

 



69 Section 6.02 _No Conflict_. Provided that all consents, approvals,
authorizations and other actions described in _Section_ __ _ 6.03_ have been
obtained or taken, except as otherwise provided in this _Article_ __ _ VI_
and except as may result from any facts or circumstances solely relating
to Seller or its Affiliates (as opposed to any Third Party), the execution,
delivery and performance by Buyer and each Buyer Party of, and the
consummation by Buyer and each Buyer Party of the transactions contemplated
by, the Buyer Transaction Agreements do not and will not (a) violate,
contravene, or conflict with or require any notice or approval under the
organizational documents of Buyer or any Buyer Party, (b) violate, contravene,
conflict with or require any notice or approval under any Law or other
Governmental Order applicable to Buyer or any Buyer Party or by which it or
its properties or assets is bound or subject or (c) result in any breach of,
or constitute a default (or event which, with the giving of notice or lapse
of time, or both, would become a default) under, or give to any Person any
rights of termination, acceleration, impairment, alteration or cancellation
of, or result in the creation of any Lien (other than Permitted Liens) on any
of the assets, rights or properties of Buyer or any Buyer Party pursuant to
any material note, bond, mortgage, indenture or Contract which Buyer, or any
Buyer Party or any of their Subsidiaries is a party or by which any of such
assets or properties is bound or subject, except, in the case of _clauses_ __
_ (b)_ and _ (c)_, any such conflicts, violations, breaches, defaults,
rights or Liens that, individually or in the aggregate, do not have, and would
not reasonably be expected to have, a Buyer Material Adverse Effect.

Section 6.03 _Consents and Approvals_. Except as set forth in Section 6.03 of
the Buyer Disclosure Schedule, or as may result from any facts or
circumstances solely relating to Seller or its Affiliates (as opposed to any
Third Party), the execution, delivery and performance by Buyer and each Buyer
Party of, and the consummation by Buyer and each Buyer Party of the
transactions contemplated by, the Buyer Transaction Agreements to which Buyer
or Buyer Party is or will be a party do not and will not, require any
Governmental Approval to be obtained or made by Buyer, any Buyer Party or any
of their Affiliates prior to the Closing, except for such Governmental
Approvals, the failure of which to be obtained or made would not, and would
not reasonably be expected to, individually or in the aggregate, have a Buyer
Material Adverse Effect.

Section 6.04 _Absence of Litigation_. There are no Actions pending with
respect to which Buyer has been served with written notice, or, to the
Knowledge of Buyer as of the date hereof, any other Action, inquiry or formal
investigation pending or threatened in writing against Buyer that question the
validity of, or seek injunctive relief with respect to, any of the Buyer
Transaction Agreements or the right of Buyer or any Buyer Party to enter into
any of the Buyer Transaction Agreements, other than such Actions, inquiries or
formal investigations as would not, and would not reasonably be expected to,
individually or in the aggregate, have a Buyer Material Adverse Effect.

Section 6.05 _Securities Matters_. The Acquired Interests are being acquired
by Buyer for its own account and without a view to the public distribution or
sale of the Acquired Interests or any interest in them. Buyer has sufficient
knowledge and experience in financial and business matters so as to be
capable of evaluating the merits and risks of its investment in the Acquired
Interests, and Buyer is capable of bearing the economic risks of such
investment,

 



70  including a complete loss of its investment in the Acquired Interests. Buyer
(a) acknowledges that the Acquired Interests have not been registered under
the Securities Act, or any securities Laws of any state or other jurisdiction
and (b) understands that it may not sell, transfer, assign, pledge or
otherwise dispose of any of the Acquired Interests other than pursuant to a
registered offering in compliance with, or in a transaction exempt from, the
registration requirements of the Securities Act and applicable securities Laws
of any state or other jurisdiction.

 

Section 6.06 _Financing_ _; Solvency_.

 

(a) Buyer has delivered to Seller true and complete copies of (i) the executed
commitment letter, dated as of the date hereof (the "Equity Commitment
Letter"), between Buyer and the Guarantors (the "Equity Financing Sources"),
pursuant to which the Equity Financing Sources have committed, subject only to
the terms thereof, to invest the amounts set forth therein on the date on
which the Closing should occur pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 3.01_ and to which
Seller is an express third party beneficiary (the "Equity Financing"), and
(ii) the executed debt commitment letters (together with the term sheet and
any other annexes, exhibits, schedules and other attachments thereto), dated
as of the date hereof (the "Debt Commitment Letters" and, together with the
Equity Commitment Letter, the "Financing Commitments") from the Debt
Financing Sources party thereto (together with the Equity Financing Source,
the "Financing Sources") pursuant to which such Debt Financing Sources have
committed, subject only to the terms thereof, to lend or invest the amounts
set forth therein for purposes of funding the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement on the date on which the Closing should occur pursuant to
_Section_ __ _ 3.01_ (the "Debt Financing" and, together with the Equity
Financing, the "Financing"). Buyer has also delivered to Seller true and
complete copies of the fee letter (with only the fee amounts, economic terms
and "market flex" provisions contained therein (none of which individually or
in the aggregate would reduce the amount of the Debt Financing or adversely
affect the availability of the Debt Financing or delay or prevent the Closing
or make the funding of the Debt Financing less likely to occur) redacted)
relating to the Debt Commitment Letters (such fee letter, the "Fee Letter").

 

(b) Assuming (i) the Financing is funded in accordance with the Financing
Commitments, (ii) the accuracy of the representations and warranties of
Seller contained in this Agreement, (iii) the performance by Seller, its
Subsidiaries and their respective Affiliates of its and their respective
obligations under this Agreement, including, but not limited to, the
obligations set forth in _Section_ __ _ 8.09_, and (iv) the satisfaction of
all of the conditions to the obligations of Buyer to consummate the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, the aggregate net proceeds from
the Financing when funded in accordance with the Financing Commitments are
sufficient to fund all of the amounts required to be provided by Buyer on the
Closing Date for the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby and
are sufficient for the satisfaction when due of all of the obligations of
Buyer under this Agreement on such date, including the payment of all costs
and expenses of the transactions contemplated hereby (including any
obligations of the Business) which become due or payable by the any Acquired
Company in connection with, or as a result of, the Closing and any repayment
or refinancing of Indebtedness required in connection therewith or
contemplated by any of the Financing Commitments (collectively, the
"Financing Uses").

 



71 (c) As of the date hereof, all of the Financing Commitments are in full force
and effect and have not been withdrawn, terminated or rescinded or otherwise
amended, supplemented or modified (or contemplated to be amended, supplemented
or modified) in any respect. Each of the Financing Commitments, in the form
delivered to Seller, is as of the date hereof (i) a legal, valid and binding
obligation of Buyer (or, if applicable, its Affiliate party thereto) and, to
the Knowledge of Buyer, the other parties thereto, and (ii) enforceable
against Buyer (or, if applicable, its Affiliate party thereto) and, to the
Knowledge of Buyer, such other parties thereto in accordance with its terms
(in each case, subject to applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, fraudulent
transfer, reorganization, moratorium and other laws affecting creditors
rights generally and general principles of equity). As of the date hereof,
there are no side letters or other Contracts or arrangements (except for the
Fee Letter with respect to the Debt Financing and any other agreements, each
of which has been delivered to Seller in accordance with the provisions of
_Section_ __ _ 6.06(a)_) relating to the Financing Commitments. As of the
date hereof, no event has occurred which, with or without notice, lapse of
time or both, would constitute a default or breach on the part of Buyer (or,
if applicable, its Affiliate party thereto) under any term, or a failure of
any condition required to be satisfied on or prior to the date hereof, of the
Financing Commitments or that would be reasonably likely to result in any
portion of the Financing necessary to consummate the Closing contemplated
thereby being unavailable on the date on which the Closing should occur
pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 3.01_. Assuming the satisfaction of the
conditions in _Section_ __ _ 11.02_, as of the date hereof, Buyer has no
reason to believe that it, any Equity Financing Source or any Debt Financing
Source would be unable to satisfy on a timely basis any term or condition of
the Financing Commitments required to be satisfied by it. Buyer (or its
applicable Affiliate) has fully paid any and all commitment fees or other fees
required by the Financing Commitments to be paid on or before the date of
this Agreement. There are no conditions precedent or other contingencies
related to the funding or investing, as applicable, of the full amount of the
Financing, other than as expressly set forth in the Financing Commitments.

 

(d) Concurrently with the execution of this Agreement, Buyer has caused the
Guarantors to deliver the Guaranty, dated as of the date hereof, to Seller.
The Guaranty is in full force and effect and has not been withdrawn or
terminated or otherwise amended, supplemented or modified in any respect. The
Guaranty is a legal and valid and binding obligation of the Guarantors,
enforceable against the Guarantors in accordance with its terms. No event has
occurred which, with or without notice, lapse of time or both, could
constitute a default or breach on the part of the Guarantors under such
Guaranty.

 

(e) Assuming the accuracy of the representations and warranties of Seller in
this Agreement, the Transaction Agreements and any certificate delivered
hereunder and thereunder, the satisfaction of the Buyers conditions precedent
to Closing under this Agreement, the fulfillment of Seller and their
respective Affiliates of their respective obligations under the Agreement,
that the most recent financial forecasts for the Business made available to
Buyer by Seller prior to the date hereof have been prepared in good faith upon
assumptions that were and continue to be reasonable and that immediately prior
to Closing (without giving effect to the Financing but after giving effect to
the Reorganization) the Business and the Acquired Companies are Solvent, then,
at and immediately following the Closing and after giving effect to all of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including the funding of the
Financing and the Financing Uses, Buyer and its Subsidiaries (including each
Acquired Company), taken as a whole on a consolidated basis, will be Solvent.
Buyer is not entering into the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
with the intent to hinder, delay or defraud either present or future creditors
of Buyer, the Business, any Acquired Company or any Affiliates thereof.

 



72 Section 6.07 _Investigation_. Buyer (a) has made its own inquiry and
investigation into, and, based thereon, has formed an independent judgment
concerning, the Acquired Companies, the Business, the Transferred Assets and
the Assumed Liabilities and (b) has been furnished with or given adequate
access to such information about the Acquired Companies, their business and
the Transferred Assets as it has requested. The only representations,
warranties, covenants and agreements made by Seller are the representations,
warranties, covenants and agreements expressly made in this Agreement, the
other Transaction Agreements and any certificate delivered hereunder and
thereunder, and Seller makes no other express or implied representation or
warranty with respect to (i) the Acquired Companies, the Business,
the Transferred Assets or the Assumed Liabilities, or (ii) any information
provided by Seller or its Affiliates or Representatives, whether or not in the
electronic data room established by Seller for Buyer, including as to (A) the
operation of the Business by Buyer after the Closing in any manner or (B) the
probable success or profitability of the ownership, use or operation of the
Acquired Companies, the Business, the Transferred Assets or the Assumed
Liabilities by Buyer after the Closing.

Section 6.08 _Brokers_. Buyer is solely responsible for the payment of the
fees and expenses of any broker, investment banker, financial adviser or
other Person acting in a similar capacity in connection with the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement or any of the Transaction Agreements based upon
arrangements made by or on behalf of Buyer or any Affiliate.

Section 6.09 _Broker-Dealer_. None of the Buyer or its Subsidiaries nor, to
the Knowledge of the Buyer, any Affiliate of such companies, or any of their
Associated Persons, is subject to "statutory disqualification" as such term is
defined in Section 3(a)(39) of the Exchange Act or is subject to a
disqualification that would be a basis for censure or suspension or
revocation of registration as a securities broker-dealer (and, if applicable,
municipal securities dealer, government securities broker or government
securities dealer) under Sections 15, 15B, or 15C of the Exchange Act,
or similar state law.

Section 6.10 _Buyer Benefit Plans_. As of the date hereof, other than as set
forth in Section 6.10 of the Buyer Disclosure Schedule, those certain joint
letters executed by the chief executive officers of Buyer and Seller describe
all of the Specified Employee Management Arrangements (as defined below) that
Buyer has offered to any Business Employee and neither Buyer nor any of its
Affiliates is party to a Contract with any Business Employee that (A) provides
for the payment of compensation or the provision of benefits or includes any
obligations, in each case, that is not conditioned on the occurrence of the
Closing or (B) does not terminate immediately following the termination of
this Agreement without any penalty to the Business Employee party thereto.
"Specified Employee Management Arrangement" means each benefit or
compensation plan, policy, program, arrangement, Contract, or agreement,
including any employment agreement, that is sponsored or maintained by Buyer
or any of its Affiliates on behalf of any Business Employee or to which a
Business Employee and Buyer or any of its Affiliates are parties, in each
case, that would reasonably be expected to, individually or in combination
with any other payment, constitute an excess parachute payment.

during regular business hours and with the supervision of a management member
of the Seller (which such person shall be made available by Seller),
reasonable access to all Business Employees and all books, records and
properties of or primarily related to the Business; _provided_ , that any such
access shall be conducted at Buyers expense, in accordance with applicable
Law (including any applicable Law relating to antitrust, competition,

Affiliates personnel and in such a manner as to maintain confidentiality and
not to unreasonably interfere with the normal operations of Seller and its
Affiliates; _provided_ , _further_ , that the parties hereto shall mutually
cooperate to develop a communications plan related to the transaction
contemplated by this Agreement targeted at Business Employees (which shall
include participation in joint meetings with Business Employees and joint
drafting of formal communications materials) and shall cooperatively execute
such plan thereafter and until the Closing. Without limiting the
terms thereof, the Confidentiality Agreement shall govern the obligations of
Buyer and its Representatives with respect to all information of any type
given, furnished or made available to them pursuant to this _Section_ __ _

information available would (A) jeopardize any attorney-client privilege, the
work product immunity or any other legal privilege or similar doctrine, (B)
contravene any applicable Law, Governmental Order, fiduciary duty or Contract,
it being understood that Seller shall (1) cooperate with any requests for, and
use its commercially reasonable efforts to obtain, any waivers and (2) use
its commercially

 



78  reasonable efforts to make other arrangements (including redacting
information or entering into joint defense agreements), in each case, that
would enable any otherwise required disclosure to Buyer or its
Representatives to occur without so jeopardizing any such privilege or
immunity or contravening such applicable Law, Governmental Order, fiduciary
duty or Contract.

 

Section 7.03 _Regulatory and Other Authorizations; Consents_.

 

(a) _General Efforts_. Prior to Closing, each of Buyer and Seller shall, and
shall cause each of its Affiliates to, use its reasonable best efforts to (i)
promptly obtain all Governmental Approvals that are necessary for its
execution and delivery of, performance of its obligations pursuant to, and
consummation of the transactions contemplated by, the Transaction
Agreements, (ii) take all such actions as are reasonably requested by any
Governmental Authority to obtain such Governmental Approval or are otherwise
reasonably necessary in order to obtain such Governmental Approvals (including
by (A) seeking to prevent the initiation of any Action, inquiry or formal
investigation challenging this Agreement or any Transaction Agreement or the
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby and (B)
promptly providing to a Governmental Authority any information and documents
requested by such Governmental Authority or that are necessary, proper or
advisable to permit consummation of the transactions contemplated by the
Transaction Agreements) and (iii) avoid the entry of, or to effect the
dissolution of, any Governmental Order that would otherwise have the effect of
preventing or materially delaying the consummation of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement. The parties to this Agreement shall cooperate
with the reasonable requests of each other in promptly seeking to obtain all
such Governmental Approvals. Neither Seller nor Buyer shall take, or permit
any of their Affiliates to take, any action that would reasonably be expected
to have the effect of delaying, impairing or impeding the receipt of any
required Governmental Approval.

(b) _Anti-Trust_ _Laws_. In furtherance and not in limitation of the
obligations set forth in _Section_ __ _ 7.03(a)_, each of Seller and Buyer

and complete filing of a Notification and Report Form pursuant to the HSR Act
with respect to the transactions contemplated hereby within ten (10) Business
Days after the date of this Agreement, (ii) supply as promptly as practicable
any additional information and documentary material that may be requested
pursuant to the HSR Act and, (iii) make all other filings that are required to
be made in order to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby pursuant
to other applicable Laws as promptly as practicable after the date of this
Agreement and supply as promptly as practicable any additional information and

Law. Buyer shall pay all filing fees associated with the HSR Act filing
and any other filings required pursuant to any other applicable antitrust Law
in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

 

(c) _Communications_. Prior to Closing, each of Seller and Buyer shall
promptly notify the other party of any written or substantive
oral communication such first party or any of its Affiliates receives from
any Governmental Authority relating to the matters that are the subject of
this Agreement and permit the other party to review in advance any proposed
submission, filing or written communication (and documents submitted
therewith) intended to be given by such first party to the Federal Trade
Commission ("FTC"), the Department of Justice ("DOJ") or any other
Governmental Authority and shall provide each other with copies of all
submissions, correspondence, filings or communications between such party or
any of its Affiliates or

 



79  Representatives, on the one hand, and any Governmental Authority or members
of its staff, on the other hand; _provided_ that such materials may be
redacted (i) to remove references concerning the valuation of the Business,
(ii) as necessary to materially comply with material contractual arrangements
and (iii) as necessary to address reasonable attorney-client or other
privilege. Except as otherwise required or requested by the applicable
Governmental Authority, prior to Closing, neither Seller nor Buyer shall agree
to participate in any meeting with any Governmental Authority (other than a
telephone call initiated by such Governmental Authority and not scheduled in
advance) in respect of any such filings, investigation or other inquiry unless
it consults with the other party in advance and, to the extent permitted by
such Governmental Authority, gives the other party the opportunity to attend
and participate at such meeting. Seller and Buyer may, as each deems
advisable and necessary, reasonably designate any competitively sensitive
material to be provided to the other under this _Section_ __ _ 7.03(c)_ as
"Antitrust Counsel Only Material." Such materials and the information
contained therein shall be given only to the outside antitrust counsel of the
recipient and will not be disclosed by such outside counsel to employees,
officers or directors of the recipient unless express permission is obtained
in advance from the source of the materials (Seller or Buyer, as the case may
be) or its legal counsel. Subject to the Confidentiality Agreement and
_Section_ __ _ 7.02_, Seller and Buyer shall coordinate and cooperate fully
with each other in exchanging such information and providing such assistance
as the other party may reasonably request in connection with the foregoing;
provided, that neither party shall be required to disclose to the other any
of its or its respective Affiliates confidential competitive information or
any personally identifiable information of their or their Affiliates
respective officers, directors or other applicable individuals. Neither party
shall be required to comply with any provision of this _Section_ __ _
7.03(c)_ to the extent that such compliance would be prohibited by applicable
Law.

 

(d) _Additional_ _Buyer_ _Covenants_. In furtherance and not in limitation of
the covenants of the parties contained in  _Sections _ _7.03(a)_ and
_7.03(b)_ , Buyer shall, and shall cause its Affiliates to, take any and all
steps not prohibited by Law to (i) avoid the entry of, or to have vacated,
lifted, reversed or overturned any decree, judgment, injunction or other
order made on antitrust grounds, whether temporary, preliminary or permanent,
that would restrain, prevent or delay the Closing past the Outside Date,
including defending (with sufficient time for resolution in advance of the
Outside Date) through litigation on the merits any claim asserted in any court
with respect to transactions contemplated by this Agreement by the FTC, the
DOJ or any other applicable Governmental Authority or any private party;
and (ii) avoid or eliminate each and every antitrust related impediment under
any applicable Law so as to enable the Closing to occur no later than the
Outside Date, including (A) proposing, negotiating, committing to and
effecting, by consent decree, hold separate order, or otherwise, the sale,
divestiture or disposition of such businesses, product lines and assets of
Buyer or any of its Affiliates, the Business or the Acquired Companies and (B)
otherwise taking or committing to take actions that after the Closing would
limit Buyers, the Acquired Companies, the Businesss or their respective
Affiliates freedom of action with respect to, or their ability to operate
and/or retain, one or more of the businesses, products lines or assets of
Buyer, the Acquired Companies, the Business or their respective Affiliates;
_provided_ , _however_ , that the effecting of any such remedy contemplated by
clause (A) or (B) is conditioned upon the consummation of the Closing;
provided, further, that nothing in this _Section_ __ _ 7.03(d)_ shall require
Buyer to agree to divest or hold separate any assets, businesses, product
lines, operations or interest therein of any of its Affiliates (other than
the Acquired Companies or the Business) or of any direct or indirect portfolio
companies (as such term is understood in the private equity industry) of
investment funds advised or managed by one or more Affiliates of Buyer.

 



80 (e) _Notification_. Each of Seller and Buyer after becoming aware thereof,
shall give reasonably prompt written notice to the other party of the
occurrence, or failure to occur, of any event which occurrence or failure to
occur has resulted in or would reasonably be expected to result in the failure
to satisfy or be able to satisfy any of the conditions specified in _Article_
__ _ XI_, and such written notice shall specify the condition which has
failed or will fail to be satisfied.

 

(f) _NCA Efforts_. Prior to Closing, Seller and Buyer shall jointly prepare,
and NCA shall file with FINRA, the CMA. Each of Seller and Buyer shall, and
cause their Affiliates to, use their reasonable best efforts to assist NCA and
provide all necessary information to NCA to enable NCA to make and submit such
filing, as promptly as practical after the execution of this Agreement,
in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to each of Seller and Buyer, to
obtain FINRA Approval of the change of ownership and Control of NCA. Prior to
Closing and subject to _Section_ __ _ 3.05_, each of Seller and Buyer
shall (and shall cause their Affiliates to) use reasonable best efforts to
(i) have the CMA approved by FINRA as promptly as practicable and (ii) satisfy
and/or comply with any restrictions, conditions or commitments (except for any
conditions that would have a material adverse effect on the Business taken as
a whole) requested by FINRA in connection with the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement. Seller and Buyer shall (and shall cause their Affiliates
to) reasonably cooperate with each other and NCA in the preparation and
submission of the CMA, and in responding to any requests by FINRA with respect
to the CMA or any requests by FINRA for any amendment or supplement thereto or
for additional information. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing,
Buyer shall, and shall cause each of its Affiliates, as appropriate, as well
as any other Person related to such Buyer, as required by FINRA, use
reasonable best efforts to provide to NCA and its counsel for filing
with FINRA, the requisite Anti-Money Laundering, OFAC and Disqualifying Event
certifications as well as formation and other organization documents of Buyer
and its Affiliates required to be disclosed to FINRA. Seller shall make
available to the Buyer all documents to be filed with the CMA prior to its
submission and provide Buyer with a reasonable opportunity to comment thereon
and incorporate reasonable comments made in good faith by Buyer. Without the
prior written consent of Buyer, neither Seller nor NCA shall agree to any
material restriction to be imposed by FINRA as conditions to the FINRA
Approval, including any requirement to maintain an amount of Regulatory
Capital in excess of the amount of Regulatory Capital required under Rule
15c3-1 of the Exchange Act as of the date hereof. Seller or Buyer, as
applicable, shall use its reasonable best efforts to file such notices and
seek such approvals with respect to NCA required to be filed with or obtained
from state securities regulators prior to the Closing Date or the Deferred BD
Closing Date, as applicable. In carrying out their obligations under this
_Section_ __ _ 7.03(f)_, Seller and Buyer will keep each other reasonably
informed of all written communications with any Governmental Authority and
will use commercially reasonable efforts to not submit or otherwise provide
any information to such Governmental Authority without first having provided
a reasonable opportunity to the other parties to comment upon such
information and to participate in any meetings, telephone calls or other
communications with such Governmental Authority; _provided_ that, with respect
to the CMA and any follow-up requests in connection therewith, or from FINRA
or any other Governmental Authority or Self-Regulatory Authority having
jurisdiction over NCA, NCA or its counsel will directly provide all such
requested information to FINRA and each of such Governmental Authority or
Self-Regulatory Authority having jurisdiction over NCA, as such authority may
so

 



81  request; _provided_ , _further_ , that any such communications with the
other parties may be redacted as reasonably determined by each such party;
_provided_ , _further_ , that unredacted versions are provided to counsel to
the other party on a confidential basis, prior to these being submitted to any
Governmental Authority or Self-Regulatory Authority.

 

(g) _Contract Consents_. Prior to the Closing, (i) Seller shall, and shall
cause its Affiliates to, use reasonable best efforts to obtain, at Sellers
sole cost and expense, any other consents and approvals that may be required
from Third Parties other than any Governmental Authority in connection with
the transactions contemplated by the Transaction Agreements ("Required Third
Party Consents") and (ii) Buyer shall, and shall cause its Affiliates to,
cooperate with Seller to obtain such Required Third Party Consent.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement, neither
party nor any of its Affiliates shall be required to compensate any Third
Party, commence or participate in any Action or offer or grant any
accommodation (financial or otherwise or to remain secondarily liable or
contingently liable for any Assumed Liability) to any Third Party to obtain
any such Required Third Party Consents. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary contained in this Agreement, if Seller has complied with its
obligations under this  _Section_ __ _ 7.03(g)_ with respect to its efforts
to obtain a Required Third Party Consent, then neither party nor any of its
Affiliates shall have any Liability to Buyer or any of its Affiliates solely
due to the failure to obtain such consent. If a Required Third Party Consent
is not obtained with respect to a customer Contract, then Seller or one of its
Affiliates (other than an Acquired Company), on the one hand, and Thoreau
Holdco or NCE or one of the Buyer Affiliates, on the other hand, shall enter
into a Subcontractor Agreement and any related task orders in connection with
the services that are the subject matter of such Subcontractor Agreement,
pursuant to which, during the period commencing on the Closing Date and
continuing until the expiration or termination of such Subcontractor Agreement
in accordance with its terms, (A) in the case of a Transferred Contract, the
Acquired Companies shall perform, as a subcontractor, all obligations of
Seller and its Affiliates under such Transferred Contract that is with Seller
or one of its Affiliates, and Seller and its Affiliates shall promptly remit
or provide to Buyer or its applicable Affiliate all payments and other
benefits received by Seller and its Affiliates with respect to the
obligations performed by Buyer or its applicable Affiliate thereunder, all in
accordance with the terms of such Subcontractor Agreement and such related
task orders, or (B) with respect to any customer Contract that is an Excluded
Asset, the Seller or its applicable Affiliate shall perform, as a
subcontractor, all obligations of the Acquired Companies under such Contract,
and such Acquired Company shall promptly remit or provide to Seller or its
applicable Affiliate all payments and other benefits received by such Acquired
Company and its Affiliates with respect to the obligations performed by Seller
or its applicable Affiliate thereunder, net of any Tax incurred in connection
with the receipt of such payment (or other benefit) or required to be
withheld on remittance and all in accordance with the terms of such
Subcontractor Agreement and such related task orders. This _Section_ __ _
7.03(g)_ does not address Shared Customer Contracts, which are addressed in
_Section_ __ _ 7.03(h)_.

 



82 (h) _Shared Customer Contracts_.

 

(i) _Replacement Contracts_. The parties acknowledge that the Acquired
Companies are parties to certain Shared Customer Contracts. Prior to the
Closing, Seller shall use reasonable best efforts, with the reasonable
cooperation of Buyer, to obtain the agreement of the Third Party that is the
counterparty to each Shared Customer Contract to enter into a new
Contract effective as of the Closing pursuant to which the Acquired Companies
provide, in all material respects, the same services and the same terms, as
the Business provided under the Shared Customer Contract to the Third Parties
prior to the Closing (each, a "Replacement Contract") and, where applicable,
to cause the applicable counterparty to release Seller and its applicable
Affiliates (excluding the Acquired Companies) from any commitments or
Liabilities primarily related to the Business thereunder. Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary set forth in this Section 7.03(h), neither Seller nor
any of its Subsidiaries shall be required to compensate any Third Party,
commence or participate in any Action or offer or grant any accommodation
(financial or otherwise or to remain secondarily liable or contingently liable
for any Assumed Liability) to any Third Party to obtain any such Replacement
Contract. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in
this Agreement, if Seller has complied with its obligations under this
_Section_ __ _ 7.03(h)(i)_ with respect to its efforts to obtain a
Replacement Contract, then neither Seller nor any of its Affiliates shall have
any Liability to Buyer or any of its Affiliates solely due to the failure to
obtain such Replacement Contract.

(ii) _Subcontractor Arrangement_. In the event the parties are unable to
enter into a Replacement Contract in accordance with _Section_ __ _ 7.03(h)_
_(i)_ with respect to a Shared Customer Contract, at the Closing, or, any
Acquired Company is unable to transfer such Shared Customer Contract to
Seller or its appropriate Affiliate in connection with the Reorganization,
then Seller or one of its Affiliates (other than an Acquired Company), on the
one hand, and Thoreau Holdco or NCE or one of the Buyer Affiliates, on the
other hand, shall enter into a Subcontractor Agreement and any related task
orders in connection with the services that are the subject matter of such
Subcontractor Agreement, pursuant to which, during the period commencing on
the Closing Date and continuing until the expiration or termination of such
Subcontractor Agreement in accordance with its terms, (A) the Acquired
Companies shall perform, as a subcontractor, all obligations of Seller and
its Affiliates under such Shared Customer Contract that is with Seller or one
of its Affiliates to the extent such obligations relate to the Business, at
rates or pricing terms that will pass through the net revenues generated
thereunder to such Acquired Company, and Seller and its Affiliates shall
promptly remit or provide to Buyer or its applicable Affiliate all payments
and other benefits received by Seller and its Affiliates with respect to the
obligations performed by Buyer or its applicable Affiliate thereunder, all in
accordance with the terms of such Subcontractor Agreement and such related
task orders, or (B) with respect to any Shared Customer Contract that is
unable to be transferred to Seller or any of its Affiliates (other than any
Acquired Company) as part of the Reorganization, the Seller or its applicable
Affiliate shall perform, as a subcontractor, all obligations of the Acquired
Companies under such Shared Customer Contract that is with such Acquired
Company to the extent such obligations relate to the Retained Business, at
rates or upon pricing terms that will pass through the net revenues generated
thereunder to such Seller or applicable Affiliate, and such Acquired Company
shall promptly remit or provide to Seller or its

 



83  applicable Affiliate all payments and other benefits received by such
Acquired Company and its Affiliates with respect to the obligations performed
by Seller or its applicable Affiliate thereunder, net of any Tax incurred in
connection with the receipt of such payment (or other benefit) or required to
be withheld on remittance and all in accordance with the terms of such
Subcontractor Agreement and such related task orders. Further, if any
engagement of the Business, on the one hand, or the Retained Business, on the
other hand, that is not arising from a Shared Customer Contract but is
existing prior to Closing, and as of prior to the date hereof used the
services of Seller or any of its applicable Affiliates or Buyer or any of the
Acquired Companies (as applicable), then such Person who is not the primary
party to such engagement, shall, or shall cause its applicable Affiliates to,
at the request of the primary party enter into a Subcontract Agreement with
the primary party to such engagement, upon the same rates and pricing terms
applicable to such engagement which will pass through the net revenues
generated thereunder to the subcontracting party thereto, in order to service
such engagement until completion thereof.

(iii) Seller and Buyer agree that Buyer or its applicable Affiliate, on the
one hand, and Seller, on the other hand, will use reasonable best efforts to
enter, or to cause to be entered, into a subcontracting agreement in
accordance with the terms set forth in Section 7.03(h)(ii) as reasonably
modified as necessary to account for any conforming changes for a Government
Contract with respect to the services provided by Seller as of the date hereof
under that certain Sellers General Services Administration ("GSA")
Professional Services Federal Supply Schedule, Contract, No. GS-00F-094CA (the
"GSA Contract") to the extent (A) permitted under such GSA Contract and (B)
Buyer or its applicable Affiliate is not able to enter into a Replacement
Contract prior to the Closing. To the extent applicable under the terms of
such GSA Contract, Buyer and its Affiliates may initiate new business through
marketing efforts under the GSA Contract for task orders until the earlier of
a period of six (6)-months following the Closing or until such time that Buyer
or its applicable Affiliate executes a new "Professional Services Federal
Supply Schedule" with GSA. Seller shall not be required to compensate any
Third Party other than any such compensation agreed to be reimbursed by the
Buyer, commence or participate in any litigation, or offer or grant any
concession, financial or otherwise, to any Third Party in order to enter into
such subcontracting relationship or to obtain from any Third Party other than
GSA any consent, approval or waiver with respect thereto. Buyer acknowledges
and agrees that Seller shall not have any Liability arising out of the
actions taken under this _Section_ __ _ 7.03(h)(iii)_ except for any failure
to comply with the terms of this _Section_ __ _ 7.03(h)(iii)_.

 

(iv) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary stated in this _Section_ __ _
7.03(h)_, if (A) any Shared Customer Contract prohibits an Acquired Company
or of the Buyer Affiliates or the Seller or one of its Affiliates, as
applicable, from acting as a subcontractor in the absence of the approval,
consent or waiver of one or more Third Parties without conflicting with,
violating, constituting a default under or breaching such Contract or
violating applicable Law, and (B) all such necessary approvals, consents and
waivers of such Third Parties have not been obtained at or prior to
the Closing, unless the parties otherwise agree in writing, during the
remaining term of the applicable portion of the Shared Customer Contract, (I)
Seller shall use its reasonable best efforts, with the reasonable cooperation
of Buyer, to allow the Business to the extent permitted by

 



84  applicable requirements of Law and applicable Contracts and to the extent
reasonably within the contractual or other ability or control of Seller or
Buyer, as the case may be, to receive the economic benefits and burdens of
such Shared Customer Contract; _provided_ , _however_ , that Buyer shall
reimburse Seller for any reasonable out of pocket expenses incurred in
connection with any such arrangement (provided that in no event will such
reimbursed expenses be in excess of the economic benefits of the applicable
Shared Customer Contract actually received by Buyer) and (II) Buyer shall, and
shall cause such Acquired Company, to use its respective reasonable
best efforts, with cooperation of Seller, to allow the Retained Business to
the extent permitted by applicable requirements of Law and the applicable
Contracts and to the extent reasonably within the contractual or other ability
or control of Buyer, Seller or an Acquired Company, as the case may be, to
receive the economic benefits and burdens of any Shared Customer Contract that
is not able to be transferred from an Acquired Company to Seller or an
Affiliate of Seller (other than the Acquired Companies) prior to Closing as
part of the Retained Business; _provided_ , _however_ , that Seller shall
reimburse Buyer for any reasonable out of pocket expenses incurred in
connection with any such arrangement (provided that in no event will such
reimbursed expenses be in excess of the economic benefits of the applicable
Shared Customer Contract actually received by Seller or its applicable
Affiliates).

 

(v) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, if
Seller has complied with its covenants in this  _Section_ __ _ 7.03(h)_ with
respect to a Shared Customer Contract, then neither Seller nor any of its
Affiliates shall have any Liability to Buyer or any of its Affiliates covenant
of Seller contained in this  _Section_ __ _ 7.03(h)_ or otherwise that
relates to Sellers obligations to obtain any Replacement Contract shall be
breached or deemed breached based on the failure to obtain any Replacement
Contract.

 

(i) _No Representations_. The foregoing agreements in this _Section_ __ _
7.03_ are made solely to facilitate the Closing and do not constitute a
representation or admission that the transactions contemplated hereby, if
consummated without any modification, would violate any Law or that agreeing
to any divestitures, hold separate conditions or other restrictions permitted
herein or suggested by any Person or authority acting under any Law would not
be harmful to the parties.

(j) _No Control Over Other s Assets_. Notwithstanding anything in this
Agreement to the contrary, Buyer acknowledges on behalf of itself and its
Affiliates and its and their directors, officers, employees, Affiliates,
agents, Representatives, successors and assigns that the operation of the
Business shall remain in the dominion and control of Seller until the Closing
and that none of the foregoing Persons will provide, directly or indirectly,
any directions, orders, advice, aid, assistance or information to any
director, officer or employee of any of the Seller, any Asset Transferors or
any Acquired Company, except as permitted by any applicable Laws in the
performance of the parties respective obligations under this Agreement.

(k) _Certain Licensed Business IP_. Following the date hereof and prior to the
two (2) year anniversary of the Closing Date, Seller shall use commercially
reasonable efforts (at Buyers expense), but does not guarantee, with the
cooperation of Buyer, to obtain the agreement of the Third Party that is the
counterparty to each license to Intellectual Property set forth on

 



85   _Schedule 7.03(k)_ that is used in the Business but is not a Transferred
Asset to enter into a new Contract effective no earlier than Closing pursuant
to which the Acquired Companies are provided, in all material respects, with
substantially the same rights and under substantially the same terms _mutatis
mutandis_ , as the Business was provided by such Third Party prior to Closing
(provided, that neither Seller nor any of its Affiliates shall be required to
compensate any Third Party (other than any such compensation agreed to be
reimbursed by the Buyer), commence or participate in any litigation, or offer
or grant any concession (financial or otherwise) to any Third Party in order
to enter into such new Contract or to obtain any consent, approval or waiver
with respect thereto). Buyer acknowledges and agrees that neither Seller nor
any of its Affiliates shall have any Liability arising out of the actions
taken solely under this _Schedule 7.03(k)_ except for failure to comply with
the terms of this _Section_ __ _ 7.03(k)_.

 

(l) _Not Applicable to Financing_. Buyers and Sellers obligations with
respect to the Financing shall be governed by  _Section_ __ _ 8.09_ and not
this _Section_ __ _ 7.03_.

Section 7.04 _Intercompany Obligations_. Except for (a) the intercompany
obligations set forth in _Schedule_ __ _ 7.04_ or (b) intercompany
receivables and payables with respect to Taxes, which shall be governed by 
_Article_ __ _ X_, Seller shall, and shall cause the Asset Transferors and
the Acquired Companies to, take such action, including making such payments as
may be necessary, so that, prior to the Effective Time, the
Acquired Companies, on the one hand, and Seller and its Affiliates (other
than the Acquired Companies), on the other hand, shall settle, discharge,
offset, pay or repay in full all intercompany loans, notes, accounts, balances
and advances, regardless of their maturity, and all intercompany receivable,
payables and other Liabilities for the amount due, including any accrued and
unpaid interest, with no further Liability or obligation on the part of Buyer,
or the Acquired Companies. For the avoidance of doubt, except for any
services provided pursuant to the Transition Services Agreement and any other
applicable Transaction Agreements, as of and following the Closing, Seller and
its Affiliates shall have no further obligation to provide any ancillary or
corporate shared services to the Acquired Companies or the Business.

Section 7.05 _Pre-_ _Closing Reorganization_.

(a) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth herein, prior to the
Closing, Seller shall, and shall cause its applicable Subsidiaries to, take
all steps necessary to effect and carry out the plan of reorganization as
detailed in _Section_ __ _ 2.02_ (the "Reorganization") no later than the
date the Closing would be required to occur pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 3.01_
( _provided_ that, from and after the earlier of (i) the date sixty (60) days
after the date hereof and (ii) the date the TUPE process relating to
the Reorganization has been satisfied, such date shall be determined for
purposes of this _Section_ __ _ 7.05(a)_ without giving effect to _Section_
__ _ 11.01(e)_ or _Section_ __ _ 11.02(f)_). Seller shall be permitted to
amend the Reorganization (and the applicable terms of this Agreement and the
Reorganization Agreements related thereto) with the prior written consent of
Buyer (not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed). As part of
the Reorganization, Seller shall cause any Acquired Company that owns any
assets, properties and rights that are Excluded Assets or Excluded Liabilities
to transfer such assets, properties and rights and assign such Liabilities so
that as of the Closing such assets, properties, rights and Liabilities are
owned by or the Liabilities of Seller or one of its Subsidiaries (other than
the Acquired Companies).

 



86 (b) Seller shall effect the Reorganization pursuant to instruments, documents
and Contracts (collectively, the "Reorganization Agreements") entered into
between by the applicable Asset Transferors and Subsidiaries of Seller between
the date hereof and Closing. The Reorganization Agreements shall not, except
as expressly required by Law, contain any representations or warranties or
provide for any recourse against any party thereto. Seller shall provide Buyer
with an opportunity to review such Reorganization Agreements and consult in
good faith with Buyer to determine appropriate forms with respect thereto. In
the event Buyer objects to the proposed form of such Reorganization
Agreements, then the parties shall effectuate the transfers contemplated under
the Reorganization to the minimum extent as required under applicable Law.
Buyer shall have the opportunity to propose additional Reorganization
Agreements and Seller will consider such proposals in good faith and cause
such Reorganization Agreements to be executed to the extent
reasonably acceptable to Seller.

(c) In the event a Transferred Asset or Assumed Liability is not transferred
or assumed, as applicable, by the applicable Acquired Company as of the
Reorganization, then Seller shall, and shall cause its applicable Affiliates,
to transfer such asset, claim, property, right or Liability to the appropriate
Acquired Company prior to Closing in accordance with the Reorganization. In
the event an Excluded Asset or Excluded Liability is not transferred or
assumed, as applicable, by the applicable Seller or Affiliate of Seller (other
than an Acquired Company) as of the Reorganization, then Seller shall,
and shall cause its applicable Affiliates, to transfer such asset, claim,
property, right or Liability to it or its appropriate Affiliate (other than an
Acquired Company) prior to Closing in accordance with the Reorganization.

 

(d) Seller shall continue to execute the de-registration process of the
Navigant Consulting (Europe) Limited  Abu Dhabi Branch at Sellers sole
expense. Buyer shall, and shall cause its applicable Buyer Affiliates to, use
commercially reasonable efforts to cooperate with Seller in such de-
registration process (at Sellers sole expense).

Section 7.06 _Exclusive Dealing_. Except as contemplated under the
Reorganization and/or solely with respect to the Retained Business, Seller
shall, and shall cause its Affiliates and Representatives to, immediately
cease any existing solicitations, discussions and negotiations with any
Person (other than Buyer and its Representatives) with respect to any proposal
concerning a sale or other disposition by Seller of any of its Subsidiaries of
(a) any Equity Interest, Acquired Interest or equity securities of any
Acquired Company or (b) any assets, properties and/or rights of the Business
outside of the ordinary course of business (a "Competing Transaction"). For
the avoidance of doubt, any sale of securities of Seller or any merger,
business combination, reorganization or recapitalization of Seller shall not
constitute a Competing Transaction and nothing in this _Section_ __ _ 7.06_
shall restrict any actions of Seller or any of its Subsidiaries with respect
thereto. Except as contemplated under the Reorganization and/or solely with
respect to the Retained Business, from the date of this Agreement through the
Closing, Seller agrees that it shall not, nor shall it permit any Affiliate
to, nor shall it authorize or knowingly permit any of its Representatives to
(i) solicit, initiate, participate in or otherwise knowingly encourage the
discussion of or submission of any proposal related to a Competing Transaction
or (ii) enter into any letter of intent or agreement in principle or any
other agreement providing for any Competing Transaction.

 



87 Section 7.07 _Certain Financial Information_. If the Closing has not occurred
as of such time, on or prior to August 31, 2018, if required by the Debt
Commitment Letter, Seller shall deliver to Buyer the unaudited, combined pro
forma (giving effect to the Reorganization) statement of assets and
liabilities of the Business at June 30, 2018 and the related unaudited, pro
forma (giving effect to the Reorganization) statement of earnings of the
Business for the six (6)-month period then ended, which in each case, shall be
compiled by management of the Seller from source documentation subject to the
controls and procedures of Sellers accounting systems (the "Updated Financial
Statements"). For the avoidance of doubt, Buyer acknowledges and agrees that
the Updated Financial Statements shall be prepared using the same accounting
principles used to prepare the Financial Statements and that the Updated
Financial Statements shall not be compliant with GAAP or Regulation S-X of the
SEC.

 

Section 7.08 _Government Contracts_. Until the Closing, Seller shall, at
Buyers request, discuss with Buyer the compliance program of Seller with
respect to Government Contracts, including discussing how Seller implemented
its program, and provide reasonable cooperation to Buyer with respect to
Buyers efforts to implement a compliance program with respect to
the Government Contracts. Buyer understands and agrees that ultimately Buyer
is responsible for the effectiveness of its Government Contract compliance
program and Seller shall have no Liability in connection actions taken solely
pursuant to this  _Section_ __ _ 7.08_ other than its failure to engage in
discussions in accordance with this _Section_ __ _ 7.08_.

 

ARTICLE VIII

 

ADDITIONAL AGREEMENTS

 

Section 8.01 _Access to Information_. After the Closing, Buyer shall, and
shall cause its Buyer Affiliates (including the Acquired Companies) to,
preserve, in accordance with and until such date as may be required by Buyers
or its applicable Affiliates standard document retention policies (but for
not less than six (6) years from the Closing Date or such later date as may
be required by applicable Law), all pre-Closing Date books and records of the
Acquired Companies and the Business possessed or controlled by such Person and
any books and records with respect to the accounting of any Long-Term
AR. During such period, upon any reasonable request from Seller or its
Representatives, Buyer or any of its Affiliates holding such books and records
shall (a) provide to Seller or its authorized Representatives reasonable
access to such books and records during normal business hours; _provided_ ,
that such access shall not unreasonably interfere with the conduct of the
business of Buyer or its Affiliates holding such books and records and (b)
permit Seller or its authorized Representatives to make copies of such books
and records, in each case, at no cost to Seller or its Representatives (other
than for reasonable out-of-pocket expenses). Nothing herein shall require
Buyer or its Affiliates to disclose any information to Seller if such
disclosure would jeopardize any attorney-client privilege, the work product
immunity or any other legal privilege or similar doctrine or contravene any
applicable Law, Governmental Order or any fiduciary duty (it being understood
that Buyer and its Affiliates shall (i) cooperate with any requests for, and
use their reasonable best efforts to obtain, any waivers, and (ii) use
their reasonable best efforts to make other arrangements (including redacting
information or entering into joint defense agreements), in each case, that
would enable otherwise required disclosure to Seller or its Representatives to
occur without so jeopardizing privilege or contravening such applicable Law,
Governmental Order or fiduciary duty or agreement) or (except as provided in
_Section_ __ _ 10.04_) require Buyer or its Affiliates to disclose its Tax
records (except for Tax records

 



88  exclusively of, or with respect to, the Acquired Companies) or any personnel
or related records. Such books and records may be requested under this
_Section_ __ _ 8.01_ to the extent reasonably required in connection with
accounting, litigation or claims relating to Excluded Liabilities (other than
litigation between the Buyer and any of its Affiliates, on the one hand, and
Seller and any of its Affiliates on the other hand), financial reporting or
federal securities disclosure. Notwithstanding the foregoing, upon the
expiration of such retention period, any and all such books and records may be
destroyed by Buyer if (and only if) Buyer sends to Seller written notice of
its intent to destroy such books and records, specifying in reasonable detail
the contents of the books and records to be destroyed; such books and records
may then be destroyed after the sixtieth (60th) day following such
notice unless Seller notifies Buyer that Seller desires to obtain possession
of such books and records, in which event Buyer shall transfer the books and
records to Seller and Seller shall pay all reasonable out-of-pocket expenses
of Buyer in connection therewith. Prior to Closing, the parties shall
reasonably cooperate with each other with respect to the separation of bank
accounts of the Acquired Companies and those of Seller and its Affiliates
(other than the Acquired Companies).

Section 8.02 _Books and Records_ _; Financial Reporting_.

(a) At the Closing, (i) Seller shall cause all tangible books and records of
the Acquired Companies to be located on the Real Properties shall be
transferred to Buyer by possession of such premises and (ii) Seller shall
transfer, or cause to be promptly transferred, to Buyer all original corporate
records of the Acquired Companies relating to the legal existence, ownership
and corporate governance of the Acquired Companies and all Permits of the
Acquired Companies, in each case, that are not located on the Real Properties
or otherwise possessed or controlled by the Acquired Companies. Prior to
the Closing, Seller and Buyer shall cooperate in good faith to develop and
implement a plan that would be reasonably expected to result in the delivery
or transfer of all other books and records of the Acquired Companies and the
Business to Buyer or the Acquired Companies at the Closing. For the avoidance
of doubt, other than as expressly provided herein and then subject to, after
the Closing, Seller and its Affiliates may retain copies of any books and
records of the Acquired Companies and the Business; _provided_ that, they
shall not access such books and records except to the extent permitted by
_Section_ __ _ 2.03(a)(x)_ or as required by applicable Law, to otherwise
perform its obligations under this Agreement or to defend against any claims
made under this Agreement.

(b) After the Closing, Seller shall, and shall cause its Affiliates
to, preserve, in accordance with Sellers, or its applicable Affiliates,
standard document retention policies and until such date as such books and
records are transferred to Buyer or the Acquired Companies, all pre-Closing
Date books and records of the Acquired Companies and the Business that have
not been transferred to Buyer. During such period, upon any request from Buyer
or its Representatives, Seller or any of its Affiliates holding such records
shall (i) provide to Buyer or its Representatives reasonable access to such
records during normal business hours; _provided_ , that such access shall not
unreasonably interfere with the conduct of the business of Seller or its
Affiliates holding such records and (ii) permit Buyer to make copies of such
records, in each case, at no cost to Buyer or its Representatives (other than
for reasonable out-of-pocket expenses). Nothing herein shall require Seller
or its Affiliates to disclose any information to Buyer if such disclosure
would jeopardize any attorney-client privilege, the work product immunity or
any other legal privilege or similar doctrine or contravene any applicable
Law, Governmental Order or any

 



89  fiduciary duty (it being understood that Seller and its Affiliates shall (A)
cooperate with any requests for, and use their reasonable best efforts to
obtain, any waivers, and (B) use their reasonable best efforts to make other
arrangements (including redacting information or entering into joint defense
agreements), in each case, that would enable otherwise required disclosure to
Buyer or its Representatives to occur without so jeopardizing privilege or
contravening such applicable Law, Governmental Order or fiduciary duty or
agreement) or (except as provided in _Section_ __ _ 10.04_) require Seller or
its Affiliates to disclose its Tax records (except for Tax records
exclusively of, or with respect to, the Acquired Companies or the Business) or
any personnel, medical or related records.

 

(c) For a period of five (5) years after the Closing, Buyer shall provide
reasonable assistance to Seller (at Sellers sole cost) in connection with
any reporting obligations of Seller pursuant to the Securities Act of 1933 or
the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended or any of the rules or
regulations promulgated thereunder (the "Exchange Act") and any other
financial reporting obligations of Seller, in each case, related to the
operations of the activities of the Business or the Acquired Companies prior
to Closing.

 

Section 8.03 _Confidentiality_.

 

(a) The terms of the confidentiality letter agreement, dated February 13, 2018
(as supplemented, the "Confidentiality Agreement"), by and between Seller,
Madison Dearborn Partners, LLC and Buyer are incorporated into this Agreement
by reference and shall continue in full force and effect until the Closing, at
which time the confidentiality obligations under the Confidentiality
Agreement shall terminate; _provided_ , that remedies with respect to breaches
of such Confidentiality Agreement that occurred prior to the Closing shall
survive the Closing. If for any reason the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement are not consummated, the Confidentiality Agreement shall continue in
full force and effect in accordance with its terms.

 

(b) From and after the Closing, Seller shall, and shall cause its Affiliates
and its and their respective Representatives to, maintain in confidence any
non-public information primarily related to the Business that is not an
Excluded Asset and that was obtained prior to the Closing Date or obtained
from Buyer or its Affiliates.

 

(c) From and after the Closing, Buyer shall, and shall cause its Affiliates
(including the Acquired Companies) and its and their Representatives to,
maintain in confidence any information primarily related to the Retained
Business that was obtained prior to the Closing Date.

 

(d) The requirements of _Section_ __ _ 8.03(b)_ and _Section_ __ _ 8.03(c)_
shall not apply to the extent that (i) any such information is or becomes
generally available to the public other than (A) in the case of Buyer, as a
result of disclosure by Seller, its Affiliates or any of its respective
Representatives and (B) in the case of Seller, as a result of disclosure by
Buyer, the Acquired Companies (after the Closing Date) or any of their
respective Affiliates or Representatives, (ii) any such information is
required or requested by applicable Law, Governmental Order or a Governmental
Authority to be disclosed after prior notice has been given to the other party
(to the extent such prior notice is permitted to be given under applicable
Law); _provided_ , that the disclosing party, to the extent
reasonably requested by the other party, shall cooperate with such

 



90  other party in seeking an appropriate order or other remedy protecting such
information from disclosure, (iii) (A) in the case of Seller, solely with
respect to information of the Buyer and its Affiliates received prior to the
Closing Date (and not with respect to any information related to the Business
that is not an Excluded Asset and that was obtained prior to the Closing
Date), any such information of the Buyer and its Affiliates received prior to
the Closing Date that was or becomes available to Seller or its Affiliates on
a non-confidential basis and from a source (other than a party to this
Agreement or any Affiliate or Representative of such party) that is known to
be bound by a confidentiality agreement with respect to such information and
(B) in the case of Buyer, any such information was or becomes available to
Buyer or its Affiliates on a non-confidential basis and from a source (other
than a party to this Agreement or any Affiliate or Representative of such
party) that is not known to be bound by a confidentiality agreement with
respect to such information or (iv) with respect to Buyer and Seller, any
information that is independently developed by or on behalf of such party
after the Closing Date without use of or reference to information otherwise
confidential hereunder. Each of the parties hereto shall instruct its
Affiliates and Representatives having access to such information of such
confidentiality obligations.

 

Section 8.04 _Insurance_. Effective at the time of the Closing, other than
pursuant to the Transition Services Agreement, the Acquired Companies and the
Business shall cease to be insured by any claims-based insurance policies or
self-insurance programs of Seller and its Affiliates. In addition, with
respect to any claims, acts, omissions, events, circumstances, occurrences or
losses that occur prior to the Closing and which the Seller becomes aware
(excluding constructive knowledge) of prior to Closing for which coverage
under such policies would be available, the Seller shall use commercially
reasonable efforts to file all claims for coverage thereunder in the ordinary
course of business in accordance with its standard risk management and claims
procedures. For the avoidance of doubt, subject to its obligations pursuant to
this Agreement, the Seller shall retain all rights to control its insurance
policies and self-insurance programs, including the right to exhaust, settle,
release, commute, buy-back or otherwise resolve disputes with respect to any
of its insurance policies and self-insurance programs and the Seller shall
retain any premiums or other retentions paid by the Business prior to the
Closing Date in respect of any insurance coverage. For any claim that may be
asserted by the Acquired Companies or their Affiliates with respect to the
Business after the Closing Date arising out of events, incidents, conduct or
circumstances that occurred prior to the Closing (such claims, "Pre-Closing
Claims"), the Acquired Companies or their Affiliates may tender such Pre-
Closing Claim to Seller for submission by Seller or one of its Affiliates to
the applicable Third-Party insurer under any of the claims made-based Third-
Party insurance policies of Seller or its Affiliates issued prior to the
Closing Date to the extent such insurance coverage exists at the time the Pre-
Closing Claim is tendered to Seller and under which the Acquired Companies or
the Business, Transferred Assets or the Assumed Liabilities were insured as of
the date of the events, incidents, conduct or circumstances giving rise to
such Pre-Closing Claim if permitted by the terms of such policy (such
policies, the "Pre-Closing Claims Made-Based Policies" and each such claim a
"Noticed Pre-Closing Claim"), and Seller shall reasonably promptly thereafter
tender, or cause one of its controlled Affiliates to tender, such Pre-Closing
Claim to the applicable insurer for coverage; _provided_ , _however_ , that
(a) neither Buyer, the Acquired Companies and their Affiliates shall have any
recourse to Seller pursuant to this  _Section_ __ _ 8.04_ for any uninsured
or uncovered amounts for such Pre-Closing Claims (including any deductible or
other amount for which Seller provides self-insurance), except for
amounts directly resulting from a breach of Seller to provide timely notice
of any Noticed Pre-Closing Claim to the applicable insurer upon Sellers
receipt of notice of such

 



91  Noticed Pre-Closing Claim from the Acquired Companies or their Affiliates if
required to do so under this _Section_ __ _ 8.04_; (b) Buyer or the
applicable Acquired Company shall be responsible for the satisfaction or
payment of any and all associated self-retentions, deductibles, costs and
expenses with respect to any Pre-Closing Claims and shall promptly reimburse
the Seller or its applicable Affiliates for its respective reasonable out-of-
pocket costs and expenses incurred in connection with collecting insurance
proceeds in respect of such claims or otherwise under this _Section_ __ _
8.04_; (c) Buyer shall reasonably cooperate with the Seller with respect to
the tendering of any such claims including providing notices, information and
backup materials as may be necessary in connection therewith; (d) the parties
shall work in good faith and use commercially reasonable efforts to ensure
compliance with all of the applicable terms of such policies so as
to minimize the risk of loss of coverage thereunder; (e) Seller shall not be
required to make any concessions to any insurance carrier in connection with
any Pre-Closing Claim; and (f) Seller shall not be required to take any
action that would violate any Pre-Closing Claims Made-Based Policy (and Seller
makes no representation or warranty with respect to the ability to take any of
the actions otherwise contemplated by this _Section_ __ _ 8.04_). The Seller
shall notify Buyer and the applicable Acquired Company of all coverage
determinations made by the insurer(s) in respect of any Pre-Closing Claims
and, if any amounts are paid or to be paid by the insurer in respect thereof,
shall request that such insurer make payment directly to the applicable
Acquired Company, or shall transfer such insurance net proceeds actually
received by Seller or its applicable Affiliates to the applicable Acquired
Company no later than ten (10) days after receipt of such insurance proceeds.
Seller shall not release, commute, buy-back or otherwise eliminate the
coverage available under any Pre-Closing Claims Made-Based Policy without
Buyers consent. Buyer agrees (A) that neither it nor any of the Acquired
Companies shall have the right to request that Seller make any claim under any
Pre-Closing Claims Made-Based Policy until Buyer has undertaken commercially
reasonable efforts to first recover for such claims under all insurance
policies of Buyer and its Buyer Affiliates with respect to such claims and (B)
in no event will Buyer or any of the Acquired Companies have the right to
receive any benefits or coverage under any Pre-Closing Claims Made-Based
Policy (either individually or together with all other claims made or benefits
or coverage sought by Buyer or any of the Acquired Companies) in excess of 33%
of the limit of such policy. Nothing in this Agreement is intended to waive
or abrogate in any way Sellers or its Affiliates own rights to insurance
coverage for any liability, whether relating to the Acquired Companies or
otherwise.

 

Section 8.05 _Rights to_ _Excluded Intellectual Property; Excluded
Trademarks_.

 

(a) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth herein, Seller and its
Affiliates (other than the Acquired Companies), hereby grant to the Acquired
Companies, effective as of the Closing and until six (6) months thereafter, a
worldwide, fully paid up, royalty free, irrevocable, non-exclusive, non
sublicensable (except as set forth in  _Section_ __ _ 8.05(d)_, non-
transferable (except as set forth in _Section_ __ _ 8.05(e)_, license under
and to any Excluded Intellectual Property (other than Excluded Trademarks)
owned as of the Closing by any Seller or Asset Transferor and used in the
Business during the twelve (12) months immediately preceding the date hereof
and necessary for the conduct of the Business as conducted during the
twelve (12) months immediately preceding the date hereof, except to the
extent such Excluded Intellectual Property is otherwise provided under a
Transaction Agreement or is listed in Schedule 5.16 of the Seller Disclosure
Schedule, (collectively, the "Seller Retained IP" and _the foregoing
license,_ "Seller Retained IP License") to use and otherwise exploit the
Seller Retained IP solely in substantially

 



92  the same manner and scope such Seller Retained IP was used in the conduct of
the Business during the twelve (12) months immediately preceding the date
hereof, including any natural improvements and extension to the Business.
Other than the Business IP, and other than as contemplated in the Transaction
Agreements or this _Section_ __ _ 8.05_, Buyer is not purchasing, acquiring
or otherwise obtaining any right, title or interest in or to any Excluded
Intellectual Property, including any Excluded Trademarks. If during the term
of the Seller Retained IP License, Buyer reasonably determines that any Seller
Retained IP is necessary to operate the Business as it was operated during
the twelve (12) months immediately preceding the date hereof, then Buyer and
Seller shall use commercially reasonable efforts to negotiate in good faith a
separate license on commercially reasonable terms granting Buyer or the
applicable Buyer Affiliate operating the Business the rights to continue to
use such Seller Retained IP for a mutually agreed upon period of time after
the expiration of the Seller Retained IP License. Upon the expiration of the
Seller Retained IP License, all rights and licenses granted to the Acquired
Companies under the Seller Retained IP shall automatically terminate and the
Acquired Companies shall cease and cause its Affiliates and sublicensees
(other than customers) to cease all use of the Seller Retained IP. Promptly
after such expiration, the Acquired Companies shall and shall cause their
Affiliates and sublicensees (other than customers) to return or destroy all
copies (in any form) of any Seller Retained IP that, to the knowledge of any
Acquired Companies, its Affiliates or sublicensees (other than customers) is
in its or their possession or control at that time and certify in writing to
Seller the completion of such return or destruction. Thereafter, if an
Acquired Company or one of its Affiliates or sublicensees (other than
customers), becomes aware of its possession or control of any Seller Retained
IP, it shall, promptly after becoming so aware, return to Seller or destroy
all copies (in any form) thereof. Neither Buyer nor any of its Affiliates
shall contest the validity, enforceability, registration or ownership of any
rights of Seller or its Affiliates in or to any of the Excluded Intellectual
Property or Excluded Trademarks. Buyer shall, and shall cause its Affiliates,
to use commercially reasonable efforts to maintain any trade secrets or
confidential information contained within such Seller Retained IP as
confidential, including refraining from disclosing such trade secrets and
confidential information to any other Person who is not bound by obligations
of confidentiality other than pursuant to reasonable confidentiality terms
(including in connection with sublicenses).

 

(b) Except (i) as otherwise expressly provided in any Transaction Agreement,
(ii) in connection with historical, Tax, employment or similar references to
the Business, (iii) for purposes of prospectus and similar disclosures as are
necessary and appropriate to describe the historical relationship of the
Acquired Companies and Seller and its Affiliates, or (iv) as otherwise
permitted or required by Law, immediately following the Closing Date, Buyer
and its Affiliates (including the Acquired Companies) shall cease and
discontinue all external uses of the Excluded Trademarks, either alone or in
combination with other words and all Trademarks or Internet domain names
similar to any of the foregoing or embodying any of the foregoing alone or in
combination with other words. The rights of the Acquired Companies to the
Excluded Trademarks pursuant to the terms of any existing trademark
agreements shall terminate on the Closing Date.

(c) Subject to Section 8.05(b), as soon as reasonably practical after
Closing, (but, in no event later than six (6) months following the Closing
Date), Buyer (including the Acquired Companies) shall cease all of its use of
the Excluded Trademarks in connection with the continued operation of
the Business as such Business is conducted as of the date hereof and re-
label, destroy, delete or exhaust all materials bearing the Excluded
Trademarks that were in 

 



93  existence as of the Closing Date, including signage, advertising,
promotional materials, Software, packaging, inventory, electronic materials,
collateral goods, stationery, business cards, websites and other materials
(except to the extent any such materials must be retained to comply with
applicable Laws or document retention notices issued by any Governmental
Authority), and make all filings with any office, agency or body to
effect the elimination of any use of the Excluded Trademarks from the
businesses of the Acquired Companies, in each case, to the extent required to
bring Buyer and its Affiliates into compliance with this _Section_ __ _
8.05_. Promptly thereafter, subject to _Section_ __ _ 8.05(b)_, Buyer shall
send a written statement to Seller verifying that it has and other users have
ceased using the Excluded Trademarks and complied with the foregoing
obligations set forth in this _Section_ __ _ 8.05(c)_. Seller shall (and
shall cause its Affiliates to, as applicable), maintain a statement and a link
on Sellers website, in a mutually agreeable form, directing customers to the
website of Buyer with respect to the Business for ninety (90) days after
Closing. Notwithstanding the foregoing in this _Section_ __ _ 8.05(c)_, in no
event shall anything in this _Section_ __ _ 8.05(c)_ be interpreted
to expressly permit Buyer to create any new materials bearing Excluded
Trademarks. Use of the Excluded Trademarks as authorized by the Transaction
Agreements shall (i) be only with respect to goods and services of a level of
quality equal to or greater than the quality of goods and services with
respect to which Seller and its Affiliates used the Excluded Trademarks prior
to Closing and (ii) comply with all graphic and other standards for use of the
Excluded Trademarks in effect on the Closing Date or as the same may be
amended by Seller following the Closing Date. After the Closing Date, Buyer
and its Affiliates (including the Acquired Companies) shall not expressly, or
by implication, do business as or represent themselves as Seller or any of
its Affiliates. Buyer may at all times after the Closing Date retain and use,
solely for Buyers internal business purposes, records and other historical or
archived documents containing or referencing the Excluded Trademarks.

(d) The Acquired Companies may sublicense the rights contained within
_Section_ __ _ 8.05(a)_, without prior written consent of Seller, only to
their respective Affiliates, suppliers, contractors, consultants,
representatives or customers for the limited purpose of providing products and
services to (or using products and services provided by any of the foregoing)
or otherwise acting on behalf of and at the direction of Buyer or its
Affiliates and in any event in a manner consistent with how the Acquired
Companies have historically sublicensed such Intellectual Property or Buyer
sublicenses its own comparable Intellectual Property.

(e) An Acquired Company or sublicensee may not assign the rights contained
within _Section_ __ _ 8.05(a)_ without the prior written consent of Seller;
_provided_ , that any Acquired Company may assign or transfer such rights in
whole or in part without the prior written consent of Seller in connection
with any merger, public offering, consolidation, reorganization, or sale of
any divisions, businesses, operating units or portion of any Acquired Company
or substantially all of the assets related to any such division, business,
operating unit or portion (and Buyer (or its Buyer Affiliates) shall have the
right to assign all or any portion to any Debt Financing Source).

 

Section 8.06 _Guarantees_. Buyer shall, and shall cause its Buyer Affiliates
to, reasonably cooperate with Seller and its Affiliates to obtain full and
irrevocable releases effective as of the Closing Date or as promptly as
practicable after the Closing Date, in respect of all Liabilities (a) under
any guaranties, letters of credit, financial assurances, letters of
comfort, bid bonds or performance or surety bonds or cash or other collateral
obtained or given by Seller or its Affiliates to the extent relating to the
Acquired Companies, the Business or any Transferred Asset

 



94  or (b) to the extent that they are Assumed Liabilities, in each of clauses
(a) and (b), as are set forth on Schedule 8.06 (collectively, to the extent
related to the Acquired Companies, the Business or any Transferred Asset, the
"Seller Guaranties"). If Seller is unable to effect such a release with
respect to any Seller Guaranty from and after Closing, any and all Losses
arising from such Seller Guaranty after the Closing and to the extent related
to the post-Closing period shall be Assumed Liabilities. Without limiting the
foregoing, after the Closing Date, Buyer will not, and will not permit any of
its Affiliates, successors or assigns to, (i) renew, extend, amend or
supplement any Contract or otherwise extend the term of or increase any
obligation that is covered by or the subject of a Seller Guaranty, (ii)
transfer to a Third Party any such Contract or other obligation. or (iii)
obtain a release from all obligations under such Contract, without providing
Seller with evidence reasonably satisfactory to it that the applicable Seller
Guaranty has been irrevocably and fully released.

 

Section 8.07 _Transaction Agreements_. The parties have agreed to the forms of
Transaction Agreements attached as Exhibits A through I and shall, at or
prior to the Closing, execute and deliver, or cause to be executed and
delivered, each such agreement.

 

Section 8.08 _Non-Solicitation_.

 

(a) For a period of two (2) years from the Closing Date, Seller shall not, and
shall cause its Subsidiaries not to, without the prior written consent of
Buyer, directly or indirectly, (i) employ or engage any Restricted Employee or
(ii) solicit for employment any Business Employee; provided, however, that
nothing in this  _Section_ __ _ 8.08(a)_ _(ii)_ shall prohibit Seller or any
of its Affiliates from placing public advertisements or engaging in any other
form of general solicitations not directed at such Persons (including the use
of an independent employment agency or search firm whose efforts are not
specifically directed at Business Employees) or from soliciting the services
of any such Person whose employment with or engagement by Buyer or any of its
Affiliates (including the Acquired Companies) has been terminated by Buyer or
its applicable Affiliate or who has otherwise ceased to be employed or engaged
by Buyer or any of its Affiliates (including the Acquired Companies) for a
period of at least three (3) months prior to the first contact by Seller or
any of its Affiliates with such Person.

(b) For a period of one (1) year from the Closing Date, Buyer shall not, and
shall cause its Buyer Affiliates (including the Acquired Companies) not to,
without the prior written consent of Seller, directly or indirectly, (i)
employ or engage any Seller Restricted Employee or (ii) solicit for
employment any Protected Person who is employed by Seller or any of its
Affiliates as of the Closing; provided, however, that nothing in this
_Section_ __ _ 8.08(b)_ _(ii)_ shall prohibit Buyer or any such of its
Affiliates from placing public advertisements or engaging in any other form
of general solicitations not directed at such Persons (including the use of an
independent employment agency or search firm whose efforts are not
specifically directed at such Persons) or from soliciting the services of any
such Person whose employment with or engagement by Seller or any of its
Affiliates has been terminated by Seller or its applicable Affiliate or who
has otherwise ceased to be employed or engaged by Seller or any of its
Affiliates for a period of at least three (3) months prior to the first
contact by Buyer or any such of its Affiliates.

 



95 (c) The parties acknowledge that the restrictions contained in this 
_Section_ __ _ 8.08_ are reasonable in scope and duration in light of the
nature, size and location of the Business. The parties further acknowledge
that the restrictions contained in this _Section_ __ _ 8.08_ are necessary
to protect Buyers significant investment in the Business, including its
goodwill. It is the desire and intent of the parties that the provisions of
this _Section_ __ _ 8.08_ be enforced to the fullest extent permissible
under applicable Law. If all or part of this _Section_ __ _ 8.08_ is held
invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced by any Law or public policy,
all other terms and provisions of this Agreement shall nevertheless remain in
full force and effect. If any part of this _Section_ __ _ 8.08_ is held to be
excessively broad as to duration, scope, activity or subject, such part will
be construed by limiting and reducing it so as to be enforceable to the
maximum extent permissible under applicable Law or public policy.

Section 8.09 _Financing_.

 

(a) Buyer acknowledges and agrees that its receipt of the Financing is not a
condition to its obligation to consummate the Closing. Buyer shall use its
reasonable best efforts and do all things necessary or advisable to arrange
and obtain the Financing as soon as reasonably practicable (taking into
account the anticipated timing of the Closing Date) and, in any event, no
later than the date the Closing is required to be effected in accordance with
_Section_ __ _ 3.01_, on the terms and conditions (including, to the extent
applicable, the "flex" provisions) described in the Financing Commitments (for
purposes of this _Section_ __ _ 8.09(a)_, the Financing Commitments and the
Debt Commitment Letters shall include any Fee Letter), including using
reasonable best efforts to (i) enter into definitive agreements with respect
to the Financing Commitments on the terms and conditions (as such terms may
be modified or adjusted in accordance with the terms of, and within the limits
of the flex provisions contained in the Fee Letter) contemplated by the
applicable Debt Commitment Letter (the "Definitive Debt Financing
Agreements"), (ii) satisfy on a timely basis (taking into account the
anticipated timing of the Closing Date) all terms, conditions and covenants,
including with respect to the payment of any commitment, engagement or
placement fees, applicable to Buyer in the Financing Commitments and the
Definitive Debt Financing Agreements, (iii) in the event that all conditions
to funding the commitments contained in the Debt Commitment Letters have been
satisfied, consummate and cause the Financing Sources to consummate the
Financing at or prior to Closing and (iv) enforce its rights under the
Financing Commitments and the Definitive Debt Financing Agreements. Buyer
shall not agree to any amendments or modifications to, or grant any waivers
of, any condition or other provision under the Financing Commitments or the
definitive agreements relating to the Financing without the prior written
consent of Seller if any such amendments, modifications or waivers would (A)
reduce the aggregate amount of the Debt Financing or Equity Financing
(including by changing the amount of fees to be paid or original issue
discount of the Debt Financing or similar fee) such that Buyer will not have
sufficient cash proceeds to pay the Purchase Price and consummate the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement and to pay related fees and
expenses required to be paid by the Buyer hereunder or in connection with
the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement on the
Closing Date, (B) impose any new or additional condition, or otherwise amend,
modify or expand any existing condition, to the funding or receipt of the Debt
Financing or Equity Financing or (C) reasonably be expected to (1) delay or
prevent the Closing, (2) make the funding of the Debt Financing or the Equity
Financing (or satisfaction of the conditions to obtaining any of the
Financing) less likely to occur or (3) adversely impact the ability of Buyer
to enforce its rights against the other parties to the Debt Commitment Letters
or the Equity Commitment Letters or the Definitive Debt Financing Agreements.
Buyer shall use its reasonable best efforts to maintain in effect the
Financing Commitments (including any Definitive

 



96  Debt Financing Agreements) until the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement are consummated. Buyer shall not release or consent to the
termination of the obligations of the Debt Financing Sources under the Debt
Financing or the Definitive Debt Financing Agreements if such release or
consent would cause the representations and warranties of Buyer contained in
_Section_ __ _ 6.06(b)_ to be untrue.

 

(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, in
no event shall Buyer or any of its Affiliates, on or prior to the Closing,
engage any bank or investment bank or other potential provider of debt or
equity financing on an exclusive basis on terms that prohibit or are designed
to prevent such provider from providing or seeking to provide financing or
other services to any Person in connection with a transaction relating to
Seller or any of its Subsidiaries.

(c) Buyer shall not, without the prior written consent of Seller, prior to or
in connection with the Closing, arrange any debt financing to which any
Acquired Company will be a party or by which any of their respective assets
shall be subject or bound, other than the Debt Financing. If any portion of
the Debt Financing necessary to consummate the Closing on the Closing Date
becomes unavailable on the terms and conditions (including any "flex"
provisions) contemplated in the Debt Commitment Letters, Buyer shall use its
reasonable best efforts to, as promptly as practicable following the
occurrence of such event but no later than the third (3rd) Business Day
immediately preceding the Outside Date, arrange and obtain from alternative
sources of debt financing an amount sufficient to satisfy the Financing Uses
on the Closing Date, on terms and conditions (including any "flex" provisions)
that are at least as favorable to Seller in the aggregate as those contained
in the applicable Debt Commitment Letter and do not expand upon the
conditions precedent or contingencies to the funding on the Closing Date of
the Financing as set forth in the applicable Debt Commitment Letter in effect
on the date hereof or otherwise materially and adversely affect the ability
or likelihood of Buyer to timely consummate the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement on such date. The new commitment letter and fee letter (if any)
entered into in connection with such alternative financing, or any other
permitted amendment, modification or waiver thereof permitted hereunder, are
referred to, respectively, as a "New Debt Commitment Letter" and a "New Fee
Letter." In the event Buyer enters into any such New Debt Commitment Letter,
(i) Buyer shall promptly provide Seller with true, correct and complete copies
thereof, (ii) any reference in this Agreement to the "Debt Financing" shall
mean the financing contemplated by any such New Debt Commitment Letter and
(iii) any reference in this Agreement to the "Debt Commitment Letter" (and any
definition incorporating the term "Debt Commitment Letter," including the
definition of Definitive Debt Financing Agreements or the Debt Financing
Sources) shall be deemed to include the Debt Commitment Letter and any Fee
Letter to the extent not superseded by a New Debt Commitment Letter or New Fee
Letter, as the case may be, at the time in question and any New Debt
Commitment Letter or New Fee Letter to the extent then in effect.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, in
connection with arranging and obtaining any such alternative financing, in no
event shall Buyer be required to pay any fees or any interest rates
applicable to the Debt Financing in excess of those contemplated by the Debt
Commitment Letters as in effect on the date hereof (including the "market
flex" provisions), or agree to any market flex term less favorable to Buyer
than such market flex term contained in the Debt Commitment Letters as in
effect on the date hereof.

 



97 (d) Buyer shall, and shall cause their representatives to, promptly following
a written request of Seller, keep Seller reasonably informed as promptly as
practicable in reasonable detail of the material activity concerning the
status of their efforts to arrange the Financing and promptly provide copies
of all Definitive Debt Financing Agreements (and drafts thereof, to the
extent reasonably requested) provided to or from the Debt Financing Sources or
otherwise related to the Debt Financing to Seller. Without limiting the
generality of the foregoing, Buyer shall (i) (A) furnish Seller complete,
correct and executed copies of any material amendments to the Financing
Commitments promptly upon their execution and (B) promptly furnish Seller
copies of any drafts of such amendments promptly following their delivery and
copies of any drafts of the Definitive Debt Financing Agreements promptly
following their delivery and (ii) give Seller prompt written notice (A) of any
default or material breach (or any event that, with or without notice, lapse
of time or both, would (or could reasonably be expected to) give rise to any
default or breach) by any party under any of the Financing Commitments or the
definitive agreements relating to the Debt Financing of which Buyer becomes
aware, (B) of any termination of either of the Financing Commitments, (C) of
the receipt of any written notice or other communication from any Person with
respect to any (1) actual or potential default, breach, termination or
repudiation of any Financing Commitment, any definitive agreement relating to
the Financing or any provision of the Financing Commitments or the definitive
agreements relating to the Financing, in each case by any party thereto, or
(2) material dispute or disagreement between or among any parties to any
Financing Commitment or the definitive agreements relating to the Financing,
and (D) if for any reason Buyer believes in good faith that it will not be
able to obtain all or any portion of the Financing necessary to consummate
the Closing on the Closing Date on the terms, in the manner or from the
sources contemplated by the Financing Commitments or the definitive agreements
relating to the Financing, as the case may be; _provided_  that in no event
shall Buyer be under any obligation pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 8.09(d)_
to disclose any information pursuant to the foregoing clauses that would waive
the protection of attorney-client or similar privilege if such party shall
have used reasonable best efforts to disclose such information in a way that
would not waive such privilege.

(e) Prior to the Closing, at Buyers sole expense, Seller shall, and shall
cause its controlled Affiliates to, in each case, use their commercially
reasonable efforts to provide, to Buyer such reasonable cooperation as is
customary in connection with the arrangement of debt financing for
transactions that are substantially similar to the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement and reasonably requested by Buyer in connection with the
arrangement of the Debt Financing, including using commercially reasonable
efforts to (i) have senior management of the Business participate in a
reasonable number of meetings (including customary one-on-one meetings with
the Debt Financing Sources and senior management and other representatives),
presentations, road shows, drafting sessions, sessions with rating agencies
and due diligence sessions, in each case, with appropriate seniority and
expertise, (ii) provide reasonable and customary assistance to Buyer and the
Debt Financing Sources in the preparation of customary bank information
memoranda (including a bank information memorandum that does not include
material non-public information), lender presentations and rating agency
presentations reasonably requested by Buyer, (iii) provide historical
information of the Business to the extent reasonably available in
connection with Buyers preparation of pro forma financial information and
pro forma financial statements to the extent reasonably and timely requested
by Buyer and required under the Debt Commitment Letters or the Definitive Debt
Financing Agreements, it being agreed that Seller and its Subsidiaries will
not be required to provide any information or assistance relating to

 



98  (A) the proposed aggregate amount of debt and equity financing, together
with assumed interest rates, dividends (if any) and fees and expenses relating
to the incurrence of such Debt Financing, (B) any post-Closing or pro forma
cost savings, synergies, capitalization, ownership or other pro forma
adjustments desired to be incorporated into any information used in connection
with the Debt Financing or (C) the preparation of any financial information
related to Buyer or any of its Subsidiaries or any adjustments that are not
directly related to the acquisition of the Business and the Acquired
Companies, Acquired Interests, Equity Interests, Transferred Assets and
Assumed Liabilities by the Buyer, (iv) promptly and, in any event, at least
three (3) Business Days prior to the Closing Date, providing all documentation
and other information required by bank regulatory authorities under
applicable "know-your-customer" and anti-money laundering rules and
regulations, including the USA PATRIOT Act, relating to any of the Acquired
Companies, in each case as reasonably requested by Buyer at least ten (10)
Business Days prior to the Closing Date, (v) to the extent required by the
Debt Commitment Letters, providing authorization letters to the Debt Financing
Sources authorizing the distribution of information of the Business to
prospective lenders or investors, executed by a senior officer of Seller and
containing a customary "10b-5" representation consistent with the Debt
Commitment Letters, (vi) furnishing Buyer as promptly as reasonably
practicable following request therefore with the Required Financial
Information, and (vii) assisting in the preparation of Definitive Debt
Financing Agreements and otherwise reasonably facilitating the pledging of
collateral and the granting of security interests in respect of the Debt
Financing (including lien searches, payoff letters, lien and guarantee
releases and instruments of termination or discharge requested by the Buyer in
order to release all Liens (other than Permitted Liens) over the
Acquired Companies, the Acquired Interests, the Equity Interests and the
Transferred Assets securing obligations under the Indebtedness of the Acquired
Companies and taking reasonable actions necessary to permit the Debt Financing
Sources to evaluate the assets of the Business for the purpose of
establishing collateral arrangements), it being understood that such documents
will not take effect until the Closing Date; _provided_ , _however_ , that (1)
nothing herein shall require such cooperation to the extent it would (A)
interfere unreasonably with the ongoing operations of Seller or any of its
Affiliates, the Business or the Retained Business or (B) require Seller or any
of its Subsidiaries to take any action that would reasonably be expected to
conflict with, or result in any violation or breach of, or default (with or
without notice or lapse of time, or both) under, the organizational documents
of the Seller or any of its Subsidiaries, any Laws or any material Contract,
(2) neither Seller nor any of its Subsidiaries shall be required to commit to
take any action that is not contingent upon the Closing or that would be
effective at or prior to the Closing, (3) neither Sellers board of directors
nor any of the boards of directors (or equivalent bodies) of any Subsidiary of
Seller shall be required to pass resolutions or consents to approve or adopt
any Financing or agreements related thereto (or any alternative
financing) (except the authorization letters contemplated above) (4) neither
Seller nor any of its Affiliates shall be required to execute any agreement or
certificate in connection with any Financing (except the authorization letters
contemplated above), (5) Seller and its Affiliates shall not be responsible
for any pro forma financial information provided or required to be provided,
in accordance with the Debt Commitment Letters or otherwise and (6) Seller and
its Affiliates shall not be required to prepare any financial statements
other than any Updated Financial Statements if required by _Section_ __ _
7.07_. The Seller and its Affiliates shall not be required to pay any
commitment or other fee or make any other payment or provide or agree to
provide any indemnity in connection with the Financing or any of the
foregoing. Buyer shall, promptly upon request by Seller, reimburse Seller for
all documented, out-of-pocket costs and expenses incurred by Seller

 



99  or any of its Affiliates and each of their respective directors, managers,
officers, employees and representatives in connection with such cooperation
pursuant to this  _Section_ __ _ 8.09(e)_ or otherwise in connection with
the Financing, including reasonable fees and expenses of legal, accounting and
other advisors. Buyer shall indemnify and hold harmless Seller and each of its
Affiliates and each of their respective directors, managers, officers,
employees and representatives from and against any and all Losses by them in
connection with the Financing (including any action taken in accordance with
this  _Section_ __ _ 8.09(e)_) and any information utilized in connection
therewith, in each case except (i) to the extent such Losses are found in a
final, non-appealable judgment by a court of competent jurisdiction to have
resulted from the material breach by Seller, any of its Subsidiaries or their
respective Representatives of its or their respective obligations under this
Agreement, or from the bad faith, gross negligence or willful misconduct of
Seller, any of its Subsidiaries or their respective Representatives or (ii)
with respect to any information prepared or provided by Seller or any of its
Subsidiaries or any of their respective Representatives. Seller hereby
consents to the reasonable use by Buyer and the Financing Sources of all of
the Businesss logos in connection with the Debt Financing; provided that such
logos shall be used solely in a manner that is not intended or reasonably
likely to harm or disparage Seller or its Affiliates, or their respective
reputation or goodwill and are used solely in connection with a description of
the Business or the transactions contemplated hereby.

 

Section 8.10 _D andO Liabilities_. From and after the Closing Date until the
sixth (6th) anniversary of the Closing Date, Buyer shall, and shall cause its
Affiliates to, maintain in full the indemnification obligations set forth in
the applicable organizational documents of the Acquired Companies, as in
effect as of the date hereof with respect to all past directors, officers and
managers of the Acquired Companies as well as all directors, officers and
managers of the Acquired Companies as of the Closing Date, in each case, for
acts or omissions occurring on or prior to the Closing Date in their
capacities as such, and to indemnify and hold harmless such Persons in
accordance therewith. Buyer, Seller and any Person entitled to indemnification
under this _Section_ __ _ 8.10_ shall cooperate in the defense of any
litigation under this  _Section_ __ _ 8.10_ and shall provide access to
properties and individuals as reasonably requested and furnish or cause to be
furnished records, information and testimony, and attend such conferences,
discovery proceedings, hearings, trials or appeals, as may be reasonably
requested in connection therewith.

Section 8.11 _Deletion of _ _Software_. In the event that after the Closing
Buyer becomes aware of any instance of any Software in its possession that is
owned by or licensed to Seller or any of its Affiliates and that is not
licensed to Buyer or the Acquired Companies, Buyer shall, and shall cause the
Acquired Companies to, use its reasonable best efforts to delete such
instances of the Software as soon as practicable.

 

Section 8.12 _Wrong Pockets_.

 

(a) During the twelve (12) month period following the Closing Date, if Buyer
or Seller discovers that any:

 

(i) Excluded Asset was directly or indirectly transferred to Buyer (or held by
the Acquired Companies) at Closing (each, a "Held Asset"), Buyer shall, and
shall cause its Buyer Affiliates to use reasonable best efforts to (A)
promptly assign and transfer all right, title and interest in such Held Asset

Affiliate (including, for the avoidance of doubt, the Acquired Companies)
receives any payment that is for the account of Seller or any of its
Affiliates (excluding any Acquired Company) under a Shared Customer Contract
that is unable to be transferred out of an Acquired Company as part of the
Reorganization, Buyer shall promptly remit (or cause to be promptly remitted)
such funds to Seller or an entity designated by Seller, net of any
Tax incurred in connection with the receipt of such funds or required to be

Section 8.16 _Mutual Release._ __

 

(a) Effective as of the Closing, Seller does hereby, for itself and each of
its Affiliates (other than the Acquired Companies) (each, a "Seller Releasing
Party"), release and absolutely forever discharge each Acquired Company, Buyer
and each of their respective Affiliates (each, a "Seller Released Party") from
and against all Seller Released Matters. For purposes of this Agreement,
"Seller Released Matters" means any and all claims, demands, proceedings,
damages, debts, liabilities, obligations, costs, expenses (including
attorneys and accountants fees and expenses), actions and causes of action
of any nature whatsoever, whether now known or unknown, suspected or
unsuspected, primary or secondary, direct or indirect, absolute or contingent
("Claims"), that any Seller Releasing Party now has, or at any time
previously had, or shall or may have in the future, as an owner of the
Business or any of the Acquired Companies, or as a counterparty to any
Contract with any Acquired Company or otherwise, in each case arising with
respect to any matter occurring at or prior to the Closing; _provided_ , that
Seller Released Matters shall not include (x) any Claim arising out of or
relating to this Agreement or any other Transaction Agreement or (y) any Claim
unrelated to the Business and the Acquired Companies or the transaction
contemplated by this Agreement or any other Transaction Agreement. It is the
intention of Seller in providing this release to the Seller Released Parties,
and in giving and receiving the consideration called for in this Agreement,
that this release shall be effective as a full and final accord and
satisfaction and general release of and from all Seller Released Matters and
the final resolution by the applicable Seller Releasing Party and the Seller
Released Parties of all Seller Released Matters.

 



102 (b) Effective as of the Closing, Buyer does hereby, for itself and each of the
Acquired Companies and each Buyer Affiliate (each, a "Buyer Releasing
Party"), release and absolutely forever discharge Seller and each of its
Affiliates (other than the Acquired Companies) (each, a "Buyer Released
Party") from and against all Buyer Released Matters. For purposes of this
Agreement, "Buyer Released Matters" means any and all Claims that any Buyer
Releasing Party now has, or at any time previously had, or shall or may have
in the future, as a Buyer Released Party, or as an owner of the Business, or

managed or otherwise directed by any Buyer Released Party or otherwise, in
each case arising with respect to any matter occurring at or prior to the
Closing; _provided_ , that Buyer Released Matters shall not include (x) any
Claim arising out of or relating to this Agreement or any other Transaction
Agreement or (y) any Claim unrelated to the Business and the Acquired
Companies or the transaction contemplated by this Agreement or any other
Transaction Agreement. It is the intention of the Buyer agreeing to the Buyer
Releasing Parties providing this release to the Buyer Released Parties, and
in giving and receiving the consideration called for in this Agreement, that
this release shall be effective as a full and final accord and satisfaction
and general release of and from all Buyer Released Matters and the final
resolution by the applicable Buyer Releasing Party and the Buyer Released
Parties of all Buyer Released Matters.

(c) Each party hereto hereby acknowledges and agrees that (other than as
expressly set forth in Section 8.08) neither this Agreement nor any of the
Transaction Agreement contains a provision preventing the Buyer and its
Affiliates, on the one hand, or Seller and its Affiliates, on the other hand,
from competing with the other and that the intent of Buyer and Seller is that
Buyer and its Affiliates, on the one hand, and Seller and its Affiliates, on
the other hand, shall be free to compete with each other. From and after
the Closing, Seller and each of its Subsidiaries shall not make any Claim
against any Continuing Employee arising out of or related to the fact that the
Continuing Employee used to be an employee, director, officer, agent or
representative of Seller or its Subsidiaries, for so long as such Continuing
Employee is employed by Buyer or one of its Affiliates, other than Claims (x)
arising from or related to fraud, criminal conduct or misconduct related to
employee relations or (y) pursuant to any Retained Restrictive Covenant
Right.

Section 8.17 _Credit Agreement Consent_ . Seller shall cause the Credit
Agreement Consent, as in effect as of the date hereof and made available to
Buyer, to be in full force and effect at the Closing. To the extent that the
Credit Agreement Consent does not cause the following, then, prior to Closing,
Seller and its Subsidiaries, as applicable, shall use reasonable best efforts
to enter into (or cause their respective Affiliates to have entered into) such
agreements and arrangements, as shall be reasonably necessary to cause, as of
the Closing, in accordance with and as provided in the Credit Agreement, the
following: (i) the Acquired Companies to be removed as parties to the Credit
Agreement and all guarantee agreements, pledge or security instruments and all
other loan documents in connection therewith (collectively with the Credit
Agreement, the "Credit Agreement Loan Documents"), (ii) the Acquired Companies
to be released from all liabilities in respect of the Credit Agreement Loan
Documents, (iii) any equity interests in, and all assets of (after giving
effect to the Reorganization), the Acquired Companies to be released as
collateral in respect of the Credit Agreement Loan Documents and (iv) delivery
to the Buyer at the Closing of all certificates representing outstanding
equity interests of the Acquired Companies. Prior to the Closing, Seller shall
provide the Buyer promptly upon written request with such information
regarding such releases as shall be reasonably necessary to allow the
Buyer to monitor the progress of such releases with respect to the Credit
Agreement Loan Documents.

EMPLOYEE MATTERS

 

Section 9.01 _Employee Matters_.

 

(a) Effective no later than immediately prior to the Closing, (i) the
employment of each U.S. Business Employee, other than a Delayed Transfer
Employee, that is not then already employed by an Acquired Company shall be
transferred to an Acquired Company and (ii) the employment of each individual
who is not a Business Employee and who is employed by an Acquired Company,
and each Delayed Transfer Employee who is employed by an Acquired Company,
shall be transferred from each such Acquired Company to Seller or one of its
Affiliates (other than an Acquired Company). The parties understand and agree
that Seller cannot cause a Business Employee to remain employed by Seller or
any of its Affiliates or accept an offer to transfer as contemplated by
_clause_ _(ii)_ and Seller shall not be considered to be in breach of this
Agreement if a Person terminates his or her employment with Seller or any of
its Affiliates or does not accept an offer to transfer as contemplated by
_clause_ _(ii)_ ; provided, __ that Seller shall retain responsibility for all
severance, termination, long service payments and other costs, liabilities
and expenses arising from the termination of any Business Employee who rejects
an employment transfer to an Acquired Company or the termination of any Person
who is not a Business Employee but who is employed by an Acquired Company and
who rejects an employment transfer to Seller or one of its Affiliates.

(b) As of the Closing Date, Buyer agrees to, or to cause an Affiliate of
Buyer (including an Acquired Company) to, continue to employ all of the
current Business Employees (including all such employees on vacation, leave or
other authorized absence) who are not Delayed Transfer Employees or H.K.
Business Employees (each such employee who continues employment, a "Continuing
Employee"). Notwithstanding the foregoing, with respect to any U.S. Business
Employee who is on a short-term or long-term disability leave of absence on
the Closing Date (each, an "Inactive Employee"), from and after the Closing
Date, Seller or one of its Affiliates (other than any Acquired Company) shall
employ such Inactive Employee, and shall provide such Inactive Employee with
disability coverage under an applicable employee benefit plan subject to the
terms of such employee benefit plan and otherwise retain all Liabilities with
respect to any Inactive Employee who returns to active employment with
Navigant or one of its Affiliates and accepts an offer of employment, if made
by Seller in its sole and absolute discretion and with Buyers written
consent, to remain an employee of Seller or one of its Affiliates;
provided that if an Inactive Employee returns to active service within nine
(9) months following the Closing Date or at such other later time as required
by applicable Law, Buyer or one of its Affiliates shall make an offer of
employment to such Inactive Employee. For the avoidance of doubt, Seller and
its Affiliates (other than any Acquired Company) shall retain all Liabilities
with respect to benefits provided to Inactive Employees under any Seller
Benefit Plan, including any Liabilities for disability coverage provided
pursuant to this Section 9.01(b). Upon accepting such an offer of employment
pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 9.01(b)_, such Inactive Employee shall become
a Continuing Employee.

 



104 (c) Thoreau Consulting Hong Kong shall offer employment to each current H.K.
Business Employee not less than seven (7) days before the Closing Date and
such offer shall be in compliance with the requirements of Hong Kong Laws.
Each H.K. Business Employee who accepts such offer, becomes an employee of
Thoreau Consulting Hong Kong, and actually performs services for Thoreau
Consulting Hong Kong, in each case in connection with the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, shall also be a Continuing Employee.

 

(d) Buyer shall, or shall cause an Affiliate of Buyer (including any of the
Acquired Companies) to offer employment to each Delayed Transfer Employee on
terms and conditions consistent with this _Section_ __ _ 9.01_ effective as
of the Delayed Transfer Date. The written offer of employment shall be made to
each Delayed Transfer Employee no later than fifteen (15) Business Days prior
to the Delayed Transfer Date. The form and substance of the written offers of
employments contemplated by this _Section_ __ _ 9.01(d)_ shall be subject to
the prior review and reasonable approval of Seller, which shall not be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed. Such offers of employment
contemplated by this _Section_ __ _ 9.01(d)_ shall be delivered to Seller no
later than ten (10) Business Days prior to the date on which the offers of
employment are distributed to each Delayed Transfer Employee. Each Delayed
Transfer Employee who accepts such offer, becomes an employee of Buyer or one
of its Affiliates, and actually performs services for Buyer or one of its
Affiliates, in each case in connection with the transactions contemplated in
this Agreement, shall also be a Continuing Employee.

 

(e) For a period of at least twelve (12) months following the Closing Date or,
if earlier, the date of termination of the relevant Continuing Employee (the
"Continuation Period"), Buyer shall, or shall cause an Affiliate of Buyer to,
provide each Continuing Employee with (i) a base salary or base wage rate, as
applicable, that is no less than the base salary or base wage rate as in
effect immediately prior to the Closing, (ii) target annual cash incentive
compensation opportunities (excluding any employee loan, signing bonus,
retention bonus or similar arrangements) that are no less than the cash
incentive compensation opportunities as in effect immediately prior to the
Closing, (iii) severance payments and benefits that are no less than the
severance payments and benefits set forth on _Schedule 9.01(e)_ , and (iv)
employee benefits (other than severance, employee loan, signing bonus,
retention bonus and equity or equity-based incentive opportunities) that, in
the aggregate, are substantially comparable to or more favorable than benefits
(other than severance, employee loan, signing bonus, retention bonus and
equity or equity-based incentive opportunities) provided immediately prior to
the Closing. Notwithstanding any provision herein to the contrary, neither
Buyer nor any of its Affiliates shall be obligated to continue to employ any
Continuing Employee or any other Person for any specific period of time
following the Closing Date, subject to applicable Law.

 

(f) Effective as of the Closing Date, except as otherwise specifically
provided in this Agreement or as required by applicable Law, (i) all
Continuing Employees shall cease any participation in, and any benefit accrual
under, and shall not be entitled to make contributions under any Seller
Benefit Plan, and (ii) all Persons who are not Continuing Employees or
their eligible dependents or beneficiaries shall cease any participation in,
and any benefit accrual under, and shall not be entitled to make contributions
under any Assumed Benefit Plan. Effective as of the Closing, Seller and its
Affiliates (other than any Acquired Company) shall assume and retain the
sponsorship of and be solely responsible for any and all Liabilities relating
to or at any time arising under or in connection with any Seller Benefit Plan
or any other benefit or compensation 

 



105  plan, program, agreement, Contract, policy or arrangement of any kind
maintained, sponsored or contributed or required to be contributed to by
Seller or any of its Affiliates (including any Acquired Company) or with
respect to which any of them has any Liability, in each case, other than any
Assumed Benefit Plan. Seller and its Affiliates (other than any Acquired
Company) shall be solely responsible for all Liabilities under Section 4980B
of the Code with respect to any Business Employees who do not become
Continuing Employees and their dependents who are "MandA qualified
beneficiaries" (as defined in Treasury Regulation Section 54.4980B-9), if
any.

(g) To the extent that service is relevant for purposes of eligibility,
benefit accrual and vesting (including, in order to calculate the amount of
any paid time off and leave balance (including vacation and sick days),
gratuities, severance and similar benefits), except, unless required by
applicable Law, not for purposes of defined benefit pension benefit accruals
or for any purpose under any equity or equity-based compensation or benefit
plan other than to determine whether a Continuing Employee is eligible for
retirement treatment (if any such plans contain such a provision) under any
employee benefit plan, program or arrangement established or maintained by
Buyer or any of its Affiliates for the benefit of the Continuing Employees
(the "Buyer Plans") following the Closing Date, such Buyer Plan shall credit
such Business Employees for service earned on and prior to the Closing Date
with Thoreau Holdco, Seller, any of their respective Affiliates and any of
their predecessors in addition to service earned with Buyer or any of Buyers
Affiliates after the Closing Date; provided, however, that such service shall
not be recognized to the extent that (i) doing so would result in a
duplication of benefits or compensation or (ii) such service was not
recognized for the same purpose under the corresponding Employee Benefit
Plans.

(h) Following the Closing Date, for the plan year in which the Closing occurs
Buyer shall, or shall cause its Affiliates to, use commercially reasonable
efforts to waive any waiting periods and actively at work or evidence of
insurability requirements and any limitations on eligibility, enrollment
and benefits relating to any preexisting medical conditions of Continuing
Employees and their eligible dependents under any Buyer Plan that is a welfare
plan to the extent such waiting periods, requirements and limitations were not
applicable or had been satisfied under the corresponding Employee Benefit
Plan prior to the Closing. Buyer shall, or shall cause its Affiliates to,
maintain or establish, benefit plans that provide for health and welfare
benefits and in which the Continuing Employees shall be eligible to
participate as of the Closing Date, subject to satisfaction of eligibility
provisions and after taking into account _Section_ __ _ 9.01(g)_ and the
first sentence in this  _Section_ __ _ 9.01(h)_; _provided_ , however, that
Continuing Employees shall be able to participate in Seller Benefit Plans that
provide health and welfare benefits following the Closing to the extent
permitted under such Seller Benefit Plans as in effect on the date hereof
until the first day of the month immediately following the month in which the
Closing occurs. Following the Closing Date, Buyer shall recognize, or shall
cause its Affiliates to also recognize, for purposes of annual deductible and
out of pocket limits under its Buyer Plans providing health benefits,
deductible, coinsurance, copayments and out of pocket expenses paid by such
Continuing Employees and their respective dependents under such Buyer Plans
in the calendar year in which the Closing Date occurs to the extent such
Continuing Employees participate in any such Buyer Plans in such same calendar
year.

 



106 (i) For the Continuation Period, Buyer shall, or shall cause its Affiliates
to, continue paid-time off programs for the benefit of Continuing Employees
that are at least as favorable as the paid-time off programs made available to
the Continuing Employees immediately prior to the Closing Date. Buyer shall,
or shall cause its Affiliates to, recognize and provide all accrued but
unused paid-time off of each such Continuing Employee as of the Closing Date
to the extent such accrued but unused paid-time off is reflected in Closing
Net Working Capital. Except as required by applicable Law, neither Seller nor
its Affiliates shall have any obligation or Liability to pay or provide any
payments in respect of paid-time off for Continuing Employees on or after the
Closing Date.

 

(j) Buyer shall, or shall cause its Affiliates to, establish or maintain a
cafeteria plan that includes a healthcare flexible spending account program
and a dependent care flexible spending account program as of the Closing (the
"Buyer FSA") for the benefit of each Continuing Employee who is a U.S.
Business Employee who, in the portion of the calendar year on or prior to the
Closing Date, contributed to the corresponding Employee Benefit Plan (the
"Seller FSA," and such Continuing Employees who are U.S. Business Employees
who contributed to the Seller FSA, the "FSA Participants"). Seller shall
provide to Buyer as soon as administratively feasible following the Closing
Date (but in no event later than seven (7) Business Days after the Closing
Date), a schedule setting forth a list of the FSA Participants, the amount
each FSA Participant has elected to contribute to the Seller FSA for the plan
year in which the Closing occurs, and the amount reimbursed by the Seller FSA
to the FSA Participant (or eligible dependent) during such plan year prior to
the Closing Date. As of the Closing Date, Buyer or its Affiliate shall cause
the balance of each FSA Participants account(s) under the Buyer FSA to be
equal to the FSA Participants balance in the applicable healthcare spending
account program and/or dependent care flexible spending account program under
the Seller FSA. If the aggregate amount withheld from FSA Participants
compensation under the Seller FSA for the plan year in which the Closing
occurs exceeds the aggregate amount of reimbursements paid to FSA
Participants prior to the Closing Date under the Seller FSA for such plan
year, Seller shall transfer (or cause to be transferred) to Buyer within
thirty (30) days after the Closing Date a cash payment equal to such excess,
if any. If the aggregate amount of reimbursements paid to FSA Participants
under the Seller FSA prior to the Closing Date for the plan year in which the
Closing occurs exceeds the aggregate amount withheld prior to the Closing Date
from the FSA Participants compensation under the Seller FSA for such plan
year, Buyer shall transfer to Seller within thirty (30) days after the Closing
Date a cash payment equal to such excess, if any. Buyer agrees to cause the
Buyer FSA to honor, and continue through the end of the plan year in which
the Closing Date occurs, the elections made by FSA Participants under the
Seller FSA in respect of the flexible spending reimbursement accounts that are
in effect immediately prior to the Closing Date. Buyer shall assume and be
solely responsible for all eligible claims for reimbursement by FSA
Participants, whether incurred prior to, on or after the Closing Date, that
have not been paid in full as of the Closing Date, which claims shall be paid
pursuant to and under the terms of the Buyer FSA. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, no Business Employee who does not become a Continuing Employee who
elects COBRA continuation coverage with respect to such persons flexible
spending account under the Seller FSA shall be considered an FSA Participant
and Buyer shall not be required to assume such Continuing Employees account
balance(s) under the Seller FSA pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 9.01(j)_.

 

(k) Buyer shall, or shall cause its Affiliates to, maintain or establish, a
defined contribution plan that is intended to be tax-qualified (the "Buyer
401(k) Plan") and in which the Continuing U.S. Employees shall be eligible to
participate as of the Closing Date, subject to satisfaction of eligibility
provisions and after taking into account  _Section_ __ _ 9.01(g)_. Buyer
shall

 



107  cause the Buyer 401(k) Plan to accept a rollover elected by a Continuing
U.S. Employee from any tax-qualified plan maintained by Seller or any of its
Affiliates (other than the Acquired Companies) to the extent consisting of
cash or notes relating to plan participant loans in a direct rollover to the
Buyer 401(k) Plan.

(l) Except as required by applicable Law or as otherwise required by the
terms of this Agreement or the Transaction Agreements, from the date of this
Agreement through the earlier to occur of the Closing or the valid termination
of this Agreement, unless Seller otherwise consents in advance in writing
(with such consent not to be unreasonably withheld and with such consent to be
provided if Seller would not incur any liability in connection with any of the
following), Buyer shall, and shall cause its Affiliates to, refrain from
taking any of the following actions if such action would reasonably be
expected to, individually or in combination with any other such payment,
constitute an excess parachute payment with respect to any Business Employee:
(i) establish, adopt, enter into or amend or promise to establish, adopt,
enter into or amend any Specified Employee Management Arrangement (or any
other employee benefit plan that would be a Specified Employee Management
Arrangement if in effect on the date hereof), (ii) take any action to
accelerate the payment, funding, right to payment or vesting of, or increase
or promise to increase, the compensation or benefits of any Business Employee,
(iii) pay or provide to any Business Employee any increased compensation or
benefits, (iv) loan or advance any money or other property to any Business
Employees, or (v) grant any equity or equity-based awards to any Business
Employee. From the date of this Agreement through the earlier to occur of the
Closing or the valid termination of this Agreement, Buyer shall not, and shall
cause its Affiliates not to, enter into any Contract with any Business
Employee that (A) provides for the payment of compensation or the provision
of benefits or includes any obligations, in each case, that is not conditioned
upon the occurrence of the Closing or (B) does not terminate immediately
following the termination of this Agreement without any penalty to
the Business Employee party thereto.

(m) Buyer shall be responsible for all Liabilities or obligations under the
WARN Act resulting from the Closing or from Buyers or its Affiliates
actions or omissions following the Closing with respect to or involving
Continuing Employees.

 

(n) As of the Closing Date, Buyer will assume, cause its Affiliate to assume,
or reimburse Seller for, all Liabilities and obligations relating to
compensation and benefits under any state workers compensation or similar Law
payable following the Closing Date to or with respect to any current or former
Continuing Employee who was providing services in support of the Business on
the date the claim arose or the incident on which the claim is based
occurred.

(o) For a period of one (1) year following the Closing, Seller and its
Subsidiaries shall not employ any Business Employee who does not become a
Continuing Employee without the prior written consent of Buyer.

 

(p) The provisions of this _Section_ __ _ 9.01_ are for the sole benefit of
the parties to this Agreement and nothing in this  _Section_ __ _ 9.01_,
expressed or implied, is intended or shall be construed to confer upon or give
to any Person (including, for the avoidance of doubt, any Continuing Employee
or other current or former employee of Seller, the Acquired Companies or any
of their Affiliates), other than the parties hereto and their respective
permitted successors and assigns, any legal or equitable or other rights or
remedies (including any third-party beneficiary 

 



108  rights). Nothing in this _Section_ __ _ 9.01_ shall (i) constitute or be
deemed to constitute the establishment, adoption or amendment of any Employee
Benefit Plan or any other benefit or compensation plan, program, policy,
Contract, agreement or other arrangement, or (ii) limit the ability of Buyer
or any of its Affiliates (including, following the Closing, any Acquired
Company) from amending, modifying or terminating any Assumed Benefit Plan or
any other benefit or compensation plan, program, policy, agreement,
arrangement or Contract at any time assumed, established, sponsored or
maintained by any of them.

 

ARTICLE X

TAX MATTERS

Section 10.01 _Liability_ _for_ _Taxes_.

 

(a) From and after the Closing, Seller shall indemnify and hold harmless the
Buyer Indemnified Parties from and against any Losses resulting from (i)
Excluded Taxes, (ii) Taxes imposed on the Acquired Companies for any taxable
year or period that ends on or before the Closing Date, and with respect to
any Straddle Period, the portion of such Straddle Period ending on
and including the Closing Date (including Taxes arising with respect to the
Reorganization), (iii) Taxes imposed on any member of an Affiliated Group of
which any Acquired Company (or any predecessor thereof) is or was a member on
or prior to the Closing Date, including pursuant to Treasury Regulations
Section 1.1502-6 (or any similar provision of Law), (iv) Taxes of any Person
imposed on any Acquired Company as a transferee or successor, by Contract or
pursuant to any Law, which Taxes relate to an event or transaction occurring
prior to the Closing, (v) Taxes imposed on Buyer (or any direct or indirect
owner of Buyer) under Sections 951(a), 951A or 965 of the Code with respect
to any transaction effected or investment made prior to the Closing relating
to the Acquired Companies, and (vi) reasonable out-of-pocket and third-party
costs and expenses associated with preparing, defending and filing any Tax
Return with respect to any taxable year or period that ends on or before the
Closing Date, and with respect to any Straddle Period, the portion of such
Straddle Period ending on and including the Closing Date; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that Seller shall not be liable for or pay, and shall not
indemnify Buyer from and against, any (A) any Assumed Taxes, (B) without
duplication of (a), any Taxes to the extent taken into account as a liability
for Taxes in clause (f) of the Final Closing Indebtedness or (C) any Taxes
imposed on the Acquired Companies as a result of transactions outside the
ordinary course of business occurring after the Closing on the Closing Date.

(b) Seller shall be entitled to any refund of (or credit for) Taxes allocable
to any taxable year or period that ends on or before the Closing Date and,
with respect to any Straddle Period, the portion of such Straddle Period
ending on and including the Closing Date, that are received by Buyer or its
Affiliates after the Closing Date to the extent attributable to Taxes that
were paid by or on behalf of the Acquired Companies prior to the Closing or
are Taxes for which Seller has fully indemnified Buyer pursuant to Section
10.01(a), except to the extent such refund is attributable to the carryback of
a Tax attribute (including a net operating loss, net capital loss, credit, or
similar Tax items) arising in a Tax period beginning after the Closing Date or
the portion of a Straddle Period that begins after the Closing Date. Any such
refunds received by Buyer or its Affiliates shall be promptly, and in any
event within thirty (30) days of the receipt of such refund, paid over to
Seller (less out-of-pocket expenses incurred in connection with obtaining
such refund and less any Taxes incurred in connection with the receipt of such
refund or required to be withheld on payment).

 



109 (c) For purposes of determining liability for Taxes of the Acquired Companies
for the portion of a Straddle Period that ends on or before the Closing Date
and the portion of a Straddle Period that begins after the Closing Date, the
determination shall be made by assuming that the Straddle Period consisted of
two (2) taxable years or periods, one which ended at the close of the Closing
Date and the other which began at the beginning of the day following the
Closing Date, and items of income, gain, deduction, loss or credit of the
Acquired Companies for the Straddle Period shall be allocated between such
two (2) taxable years or periods on a "closing of the books basis" by assuming
that the books of the Acquired Companies were closed at the close of the
Closing Date; _provided_ , _however_ , that, in each case, (i) transactions
occurring after the Closing on the Closing Date that are outside the ordinary
course of business shall be allocated to the taxable year or period that is
deemed to begin at the beginning of the day following the Closing Date, and
(ii) Taxes, exemptions, allowances or deductions that are calculated on an
annual or other periodic basis, such as property Tax and depreciation
deductions (but excluding for the avoidance of doubt any Taxes based on
or measured by income, gross or net sales, payments, receipts, use, or
payroll), shall be apportioned between such two (2) taxable years or periods
on a daily basis.

 

(d) Notwithstanding anything to contrary in this Agreement, Buyer shall be
liable for fifty percent (50%), and Seller shall be liable for the remaining
fifty percent (50%), of any sales Tax, use Tax, real property transfer Tax,
excise Tax, value-added Tax, documentary stamp Tax or similar Tax ("Transfer
Tax") attributable to the sale or transfer of the Acquired Companies, the
Business, the Transferred Assets or the Assumed Liabilities (excluding, for
the avoidance of doubt, any income, franchises, capital gains and similar
Taxes based on income or gain). The parties hereto agree to timely sign and
deliver such resale and other certificates or forms as may be necessary or
appropriate to establish an exemption from (or otherwise reduce), or file Tax
Returns or other reports with respect to, such Taxes. For the avoidance of
doubt, Seller shall be liable for any Transfer Tax attributable to the
Reorganization.

Section 10.02 _Tax Returns_.

 

(a) Seller shall timely file or cause to be timely filed when due (taking into
account all extensions properly obtained) all Tax Returns that are required
to be filed by or with respect to the Acquired Companies on a combined,
consolidated or unitary basis with Seller or any Affiliate thereof (other than
an Acquired Company). All Tax Returns that Seller is required to file or cause
to be filed in accordance with this _Section_ __ _ 10.02_ that relate to any
taxable year or period ending on or before the Closing Date or any Straddle
Period shall be prepared and filed in a manner consistent with past practice
and, on such Tax Returns, no position shall be taken, election made or method
adopted that is inconsistent with positions taken, elections made or methods
used in preparing and filing similar Tax Returns in prior periods, except to
the extent required by applicable Law. Seller shall timely remit or cause to
be remitted any Taxes due in respect of such Tax Returns.

 



110 (b) Buyer shall timely to file or cause to be timely filed when due (taking
into account all extensions properly obtained) all other Tax Returns required
to be filed after the Closing Date by or with respect to the Acquired
Companies that relate to any taxable year or period ending on or before the
Closing Date or any Straddle Period. Buyer shall timely remit or cause to be
remitted any Taxes due in respect of such Tax Returns to the extent such Taxes
were included as a Liability for Taxes in clause (f) of the Final Closing
Indebtedness or are Taxes for which Seller has fully indemnified Buyer
pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 10.01(a)_. All such Tax Returns shall be prepared
and filed in a manner consistent with past practice and, on such Tax Returns,
no position shall be taken, election made or method adopted that is
inconsistent with positions taken, elections made or methods used in preparing
and filing similar Tax Returns in prior periods, in each case except to the
extent required by applicable Law. With respect to any such Tax Return to
be filed by Buyer that is an income Tax Return, not less than twenty (20)
days prior to the due date for such Tax Return, taking into account extensions
(or, if such due date is within twenty (20) days following the Closing Date,
as promptly as practicable following the Closing Date), Buyer shall provide
Seller with a draft copy of such Tax Return for Sellers approval, which
approval shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed; provided
that if such Tax Return has not been approved by Seller prior to its due
date, such Tax Return shall be timely filed as prepared by Buyer, subject to
later amendment to reflect the agreed filing positions.

 

(c) Without the prior written consent of Seller (not to be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned or delayed), and except as required by applicable Law,
none of Buyer or any Affiliate of Buyer shall (or shall cause or permit the
Acquired Companies to) make or change any Tax election, amend, refile or
otherwise modify any Tax Return (or grant an extension of any statute of
limitations with respect to a material Tax Return) relating in whole or in
part to the Acquired Companies with respect to any taxable year or period (or
portion thereof) ending on or before the Closing Date to the extent such
action would (i) affect the Tax Liabilities for which Seller is liable
pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 10.01(a)_ or (ii) increase any Tax liability of
Seller or any of its Affiliates in respect of any taxable year or period (or
portion thereof) ending on or before the Closing Date.

Section 10.03 _Contest Provisions_. Buyer shall promptly notify Seller in
writing upon receipt by Buyer, any of its Affiliates or any of the Acquired
Companies of notice of any pending or threatened federal, state, local or
foreign Tax audits, examinations or assessments which would affect the Tax
Liabilities for which Seller is liable pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 10.01(a)_
(a "Pre-Closing Tax Contest"); provided, however, that failure to provide such
notice shall not void any indemnity hereunder except to the extent Seller is
actually prejudiced by such failure. Seller shall have the right to elect,
within thirty (30) days of receipt of written notice, to represent the
Acquired Companies interests in any such Tax audit or administrative or
court proceeding conducted on a combined, consolidated or unitary basis with
Seller or solely relating to taxable periods ending on or before the Closing
Date the resolution of which is not reasonably expected to affect any Taxes or
Tax position in any Tax period beginning on or after the Closing Date and for
which Seller is liable pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 10.01(a)_, and to employ
counsel of its choice at its expense; _provided_ that Buyer shall have the
right to participate in any such audit or proceeding with respect to Taxes
imposed on the Acquired Companies, the Transferred Assets or the Business
(except to the extent that such audit or proceeding is with respect to U.S.
federal or state income Taxes imposed or calculated on a combined,
consolidated or unitary basis with Seller or any of its Affiliates) and Seller
shall (a) keep Buyer informed of the progress of any such audit or proceeding
in a timely manner, (b) promptly provide Buyer with copies of all material
correspondence or other material documents relating to such audit or
proceeding, (c) promptly provide notice to Buyer of any material scheduled
meetings (whether telephonic or in person) with any Taxing Authority

 



111  relating to such audit or proceeding, and (d) not settle any such audit or
proceeding without the prior written consent of Buyer, which consent shall not
be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed, to the extent such
settlement could reasonably be expected to affect any Taxes or Tax position of
the Buyer or its Affiliates (including the Acquired Companies) in any Taxable
year or period (or portion thereof) ending after the Closing Date. If Seller
does not or cannot elect to control a Pre-Closing Tax Contest, Buyer shall
control such proceeding and Seller shall have the rights of the non-
controlling party, mutatis mutandis. In the case of any such audit or
proceeding of an Acquired Company for a Straddle Period, Seller shall be
entitled to elect to participate at its expense in such audit or proceeding
with respect to the portion of such Straddle Period ending on or before the
Closing Date for which Seller is liable pursuant to _ 
Section_ __ _ 10.01(a)_. None of Buyer, any of its Affiliates or the
Acquired Companies may settle any such audit or proceeding with respect to
the portion of such audit or proceeding relating to Taxes for which Seller is
liable pursuant to _ 
Section_ __ _ 10.01(a)_, without the prior written consent of Seller, not to
be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed.

Section 10.04 _Assistance and Cooperation_. After the Closing Date, each of
Seller and Buyer shall, and shall cause its controlled Affiliates to use
reasonable commercial efforts to:

(a) provide the other party any information relating to the Acquired
Companies, the Business or the Transferred Assets within its possession that
is reasonably necessary for such other party to prepare any Tax Returns
relating to the Acquired Companies, the Business or the Transferred Assets
which such other party is responsible for preparing and filing;

(b) reasonably cooperate in preparing for any audits of, or disputes with Tax
Authorities regarding, any Tax Returns to the extent relating to the Acquired
Companies, the Business or the Transferred Assets;

 

(c) make available to the other and to any Tax Authority as reasonably
requested all information, records and documents (other than Excluded Books
and Records) relating to Taxes of the Acquired Companies, the Business or the
Transferred Assets within its possession; and

(d) furnish the other with copies of all correspondence received from any Tax
Authority in connection with any Tax audit or information request relating

(a) Navigant Consulting (PI-NY) Inc., PACE Claim Services, LLC, and Seller
make timely and irrevocable elections under Section 336(e) of the Code (and
under similar provisions of state or local law) with respect to Buyers
acquisition of the Equity Securities of Navigant Consulting (PI-NY) Inc.
and PACE Claim Services, LLC under this Agreement (collectively, the "Section
336(e) Elections"). This Agreement shall be treated as a written binding
agreement among Navigant Consulting (PI-NY) Inc., PACE Claim Services, LLC
and Seller to make the Section 336(e) Elections, as required under Section
1.336-2(h)(3)(i) of the Treasury Regulations. The parties further agree that:

(b) Buyer shall cause each of Navigant Consulting (PI-NY) Inc. and PACE Claim
Services, LLC to prepare the statement described in Section 1.336-2(h)(3)(iii)
of the Treasury Regulations (collectively, the "Section 336(e)
Election Statements"), which shall be substantially in the form of Exhibit I.
Navigant Consulting (PI-NY) Inc., PACE Claim Services, LLC and Seller shall
cooperate with Buyer in connection with the Section 336(e) Election
(including the preparation of the Section 336(e) Election Statement), and
shall not take, or fail to take, any action that could cause the Section
336(e) election to be invalid or take any position contrary thereto unless
required pursuant to a determination as defined in Section 1313(a) of the
Code.

(c) Each of Navigant Consulting (PI-NY) Inc. and PACE Claim Services, LLC
shall attach the applicable Section 336(e) Election Statement to its timely
filed (including extensions) federal income Tax Return for the taxable period
that includes the Closing Date.

Section 10.06 _Election Under Section_ __ _ 338(g)_. Prior to Closing, Seller
will (and will cause the Acquired Companies to) work together with Buyer in
good faith to jointly and reasonably estimate and ultimately agree upon the
incremental Tax costs that would be incurred by Seller, if any, if Buyer makes
or causes or permits to be made any election under Section 338(g) of the Code
or under any applicable similar provision of state or foreign law with respect
to the acquisition of any Acquired Company that is not a domestic corporation
for U.S. federal income Tax purposes under this Agreement. If Buyer
determines to make any such election, upon the making of such election, Buyer
shall promptly remit to Seller an amount of cash equal to the incremental Tax
costs determined in accordance with the preceding sentence. In the event
Seller and Buyer cannot agree on the amount of incremental Tax costs that
would be incurred by Seller, then prior to the making of any such election,
Buyer and Seller shall submit such dispute to the Independent Accounting Firm,
which dispute shall be resolved within six months of the Closing Date
pursuant to the procedures set forth in _Section_ __ _ 2.06(e)_ and _(f)_.

 

Section 10.07 _Tax_ _Sharing Agreements_. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary contained herein, Seller shall, and shall cause its Affiliates to,
take such actions as may be necessary to (i) terminate, prior to or
concurrently with the Closing, all Tax allocation agreements, Tax sharing
agreements, or similar contracts or arrangements to which any
Acquired Company is a party, and (ii) ensure that the obligations of the
parties under any such agreements shall not remain in effect after the
Closing.

 



113 Section 10.08 _Wage Reporting_. Buyers and Seller agree to utilize, or cause
their respective Affiliates to utilize, the standard procedure set forth in
Revenue Procedure 2004-53 with respect to wage reporting as applicable.

Closing:

 

(a) by the mutual written consent of Seller and Buyer;

 



115 (b) by either Seller or Buyer if the Closing shall not have occurred prior to

Agreement (the "Outside Date") or such later date as the parties may mutually
agree in writing; _provided_ , that the right to terminate this Agreement
under this  _Section_ __ _ 12.01(b)_ shall not be available to any party

breach is either not capable of being cured prior to the Outside Date or,
if curable, Seller shall have failed to cure such breach within sixty (60)
days after receipt of written notice thereof from Buyer requesting such breach
to be cured; _provided_ , _however_ , that Buyer may not terminate this
Agreement pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 12.01(d)_ if Buyer is then in

11.01_ not to be satisfied at the time the Closing would otherwise be required
to occur hereunder;

(e) by Seller in the event there has occurred any breach by Buyer of any of

this Agreement in any material respect, which material breach causes or would
reasonably be expected to cause, the conditions in Section 11.02 not to be
satisfied at the time of Closing; or

 

(f) by Seller in the event (i) the conditions set forth in _Section_ __ _
11.02_ shall have been satisfied or, to the extent permitted, waived (other
than those conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied at the Closing,
each of which would be satisfied if the Closing were to immediately occur) and
Buyer fails to consummate the Closing on the date the Closing was to have
occurred pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 3.01_), (ii) Seller has irrevocably
confirmed by written notice to Buyer that all conditions set forth in
_Article_ _11.01_ have been satisfied (other than those conditions that by

and the Equity Financing are funded, the Closing will occur, and (iii) Buyer
fails to consummate the Closing within three (3) Business Days following the
date on which the Closing was required to occur pursuant to  _Section_ __ _

pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 12.01(b)_).

 



116 Section 12.02 _Notice of Termination_. Any party exercising its right to

Section 12.03 _Effect of Termination_.

_Section_ __ _ 12.03_ (Effect of Termination), the last sentence of
_Section_ __ _ 7.03(b)_, the definitions set forth in _Section_ __ _ 1.01_
and _Article_ __ _ XIV_ (General Provisions), Buyers payment obligations
with respect to _Section_ __ _ 8.14_ (Real Estate Leases), and Buyers
payment obligations in accordance with _Section_ __ _ 8.09(e)_, shall survive
the termination of this Agreement;  _provided_ , that nothing in this
_Section_ __ _ 12.03_(a) shall relieve either Seller or Buyer from Liability
for such partys fraud in the making of the representations, warranties,
covenants and agreements under this Agreement or willful, knowing and
intentional breach of this Agreement (by action, omission or otherwise).

(b) In the event this Agreement is validly terminated by Seller pursuant to
_Section_ __ _ 12.01(e)_ or _Section_ __ _ 12.01(f)_, then no later than two
(2) Business Days after such termination, Seller shall have the right to
require Buyer to pay (or cause to be paid) to Seller as liquidated damages in
connection with any such termination, an amount equal to $28,200,000 (the
"Termination Fee") which Termination Fee, if paid, shall be the sole and
exclusive remedy of the Seller and its Affiliates for any breach or failure
to perform by the Buyer of any of its representations, warranties, covenants
or agreements contained in this Agreement; _provided_ , that on and following
the date that is one hundred twenty (120) days after a termination of this
Agreement pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 12.03_ (the "Cutoff Date"), none of
Seller or any other Person shall have any right to seek or obtain the
Termination Fee unless prior to the Cutoff Date, Seller shall have commenced
an Action against Buyer alleging that the Termination Fee is due and owing.

 

(c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, to the extent
that Seller has terminated this Agreement, elected to receive the Termination
Fee in writing and actually received the Termination Fee, receipt of such
Termination Fee shall be deemed to be liquidated damages for any and all
Losses or damages suffered or incurred by Seller, the Acquired Companies or
any other Person in connection with this Agreement, the other Transaction
Documents, the Financing Commitments (and the termination hereof or thereof),
the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby (and the abandonment or
termination thereof) or any matter forming the basis for such termination,
and none of the Seller, the Acquired Companies or any other Person shall be
entitled to bring or maintain any claim or Action against Buyer, the Debt
Financing Sources, the Guarantors, the Equity Financing Sources or any of
their respective Affiliates arising out of, or in connection with, this
Agreement, the other Transaction Documents, the Financing Commitments (and the
terms hereof and thereof), any of the transactions contemplated hereby
or thereby (or the abandonment or termination thereof). Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary in this Agreement, the Equity Commitment Letter, any
other agreement or otherwise, and subject to Sellers right to seek specific
performance pursuant to, and solely to the extent provided in _Section_ __ _
14.14_, (i) Sellers right to terminate this Agreement and receive payment of
the Termination Fee pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 12.03_ will be the sole
and exclusive

 



117  remedy of Seller, the Acquired Companies and their respective Affiliates
against Buyer, the Debt Financing Sources, the Equity Financing Sources or any
of their respective Affiliates for the failure of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement to be consummated in the circumstances, and
only in the circumstances described in _Section_ __ _ 12.01(e)_ or _Section_
__ _ 12.01(f)_ and this  _Section_ __ _ 12.03_, and upon such termination
and payment to Seller of the Termination Fee, none of Buyer, the Debt
Financing Sources, the Equity Financing Sources or any of their respective
Affiliates will have any further Liability or obligation relating to or
arising out of this Agreement, the other Transaction Documents, the Financing
Commitments, the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or the
Transaction Agreements, any breach of this Agreement or the other Transaction
Documents or any failure of such transactions to be consummated, in each case
whether based on contract (including under this Agreement or otherwise), tort
or strict liability, by the enforcement of any assessment, by any Action, by
virtue of any Law or otherwise and whether by or through attempted piercing of
the corporate veil, by or through a claim by or on behalf of a party hereto or
another Person, or otherwise; and (ii) in connection with any Losses suffered
as a result of any breach (including, for the avoidance of doubt, any
willful, knowing or intentional breach) of any representation, warranty,
covenant, obligation or agreement in this Agreement by Buyer, or the failure
of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or the Transaction
Agreements to be consummated, or otherwise relating to or arising out of this
Agreement, the other Transaction Documents, the Financing Commitments, the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement or the Transaction Agreements, in
each case, other than in the circumstances described in _clause (_ i _)_
immediately above, the maximum aggregate liability of Buyer (or the Equity
Financing Sources) (including in respect of any damages award in lieu of a
grant of specific performance and Buyers payment obligations under _Sections
8.14_ and _8.09(e)_ ) will not exceed the amount of the Termination Fee; and
in no event will any of Seller, the Acquired Companies or any of their
respective Affiliates or any other Person (and each of them agrees to not),
(x) seek to recover any money damages in excess of such amount or (y) seek to
recover monetary damages from Buyer, the Debt Financing Sources, or any of
their respective Affiliates (other than against Buyer or in accordance with
the Guaranty for payment of such amounts) and in no event will any of Seller,
the Acquired Companies or any of their respective Affiliates or any other
Person (and each of them agrees to not) seek to recover any damages from the
Debt Financing Sources in connection with any such termination or Losses. For
the avoidance of doubt, in no event shall Buyer be obligated to pay both the
Termination Fee and any monetary damages (including in respect of any damages
awarded in lieu of a grant of specific performance) pursuant to this _Section_
__ _ 12.03_ (which damages in no event shall exceed the Termination Fee) or
otherwise in connection with the termination of this Agreement for any
reason. Each of the parties to this Agreement further acknowledges and agrees
that the damages resulting from termination of this Agreement under
circumstances where the Termination Fee is payable are uncertain and
therefore the payment by Buyer of the Termination Fee is not a penalty, but
constitutes liquidated damages in a reasonable amount that are designed to
compensate Seller in the circumstances in which such fee is payable for the
efforts and resources expended and the opportunities foregone while
negotiating this Agreement and in reliance on this Agreement and on the
expectation of the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby, which
amount would otherwise be impossible to calculate with precision (Buyer
agrees the foregoing sentence shall not in any way limit Sellers rights to
specific performance). Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, (i)
the Seller may simultaneously pursue (a) a grant of specific performance
pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 14.14_ and (b) payment of the Termination Fee
pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 12.03(b)_; _provided_ , that in no event shall
Seller be entitled to receive both a grant of specific

 



118  performance and payment of the Termination Fee, (ii) the Buyer may elect at
any time and in its sole discretion to consummate the Closing after receipt of
written notice of termination in lieu of paying the Termination Fee and (iii)
in no event shall the Termination Fee or any portion thereof be paid on more
than one occasion, whether by Buyer or on behalf of Buyer.

 

Section 12.04 _Extension; Waiver_. At any time prior to the Closing, each of
Seller and Buyer may (a) extend the time for the performance of any of the
obligations or other acts of the other party, (b) waive any inaccuracies in
the representations and warranties of the other party contained in this
Agreement or in any certificate, instrument, schedule or other document
delivered pursuant to this Agreement or (c) to the extent permitted by Law,
waive compliance by the other party with any of the agreements or conditions
contained in this Agreement. Any such extension or waiver shall be valid only
if set forth in an instrument in writing signed by the party granting such
extension or waiver. Neither the waiver by either of the parties to this
Agreement of a breach of or a default under any of the provisions of this
Agreement, nor the failure by either of the parties to this Agreement, on one
or more occasions, to enforce any of the provisions of this Agreement or to
exercise any right or privilege hereunder, shall be construed as a waiver of
any other breach or default of a similar nature, or as a waiver of any of
such provisions, rights or privileges hereunder.

ARTICLE XIII

 

INDEMNIFICATION

 

Section 13.01 _Indemnification by_ _Seller_.

 

(a) After the Closing and subject to _Article_ __ _ X_, the other provisions
of this _Article_ __ _ XIII_ and _Section_ __ _ 14.01_, Seller shall
indemnify and hold harmless Buyer, and its Affiliates and each of their
officers, directors, managers, equityholders, partners, members, employees and
Representatives, and any of the respective heirs, successors and assigns of
the foregoing (including the Acquired Companies) (collectively, the "Buyer
Indemnified Parties") against all Losses suffered or incurred by any Buyer
Indemnified Party, or to which any Buyer Indemnified Party otherwise becomes
subject, as a result of, arising out of or relating to:

(i) inaccuracy or breach of any representation or warranty made by Seller in
_Article_ __ _ IV_ or _Article_ __ _ V_ of this Agreement;

 

(ii) any breach or failure by Seller to perform or fulfill any of its
covenants or obligations contained in this Agreement; 

(iii) any (A) Excluded Liability or (B) Seller Retained Current Liability; or

 

(iv) the Reorganization.



 

(b) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement to the contrary,
Seller shall not be required to indemnify or hold harmless any
Buyer Indemnified Party against any Losses pursuant to _Section_ __ _
13.01(a)(i)_ (other than Losses to the extent arising as a result of the
inaccuracy or breach of any Specified Representations, as to which the
limitations in this sentence shall not apply) (i) with respect to any claim
(or series of related claims arising from substantially

 



119  the same underlying facts, events or circumstances) unless such claim (or
series of related claims arising from substantially the same underlying facts,
events or circumstances) involves Losses in excess of $250,000 and (ii) until
the aggregate amount of the Buyer Indemnified Parties Losses pursuant to
_Section_ __ _ 13.01(a)(i)_ exceeds $4,700,000, after which Seller shall,
subject to the immediately succeeding sentence, be obligated to indemnify and
hold harmless the Buyer Indemnified Parties against all Losses of the Buyer
Indemnified Parties pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 13.01(a)(i)_ that in the
aggregate are in excess of such amount. The cumulative aggregate liability of
Seller under _Section_ __ _ 13.01(a)(i)_ shall in no event exceed $23,500,000
(other than in respect of Losses to the extent arising as a result of the
inaccuracy or breach of any Specified Representation). The cumulative
aggregate liability of Seller under this _Article_ __ _ XIII_ shall in no
event exceed the Base Purchase Price. For the avoidance of doubt, in no event
shall any Losses that are otherwise indemnifiable pursuant to this _Section_
__ _ 13.01_ be affected by such Loss being an Assumed Liability. For the
avoidance of doubt, Excluded Liabilities shall be deemed to include those
Liabilities arising from or relating to the operations of the Retained
Business following Closing to the extent such Liabilities would have been
Excluded Liabilities as of Closing if they existed as of the Closing (it being
understood and agreed that such Liabilities being Excluded Liabilities shall
not affect Sellers rights to indemnification under _Section_ __ _ 13.02_).

Section 13.02  _Indemnification by_ _Buyer_.

(a) After the Closing and subject to _Article_ __ _ X_, the other provisions
of this _Article_ __ _ XIII_ and _Section_ __ _ 14.01_, Buyer shall
indemnify and hold harmless Seller and its Affiliates and each of their
officers, directors, managers, equityholders, partners, members,
employees and Representatives, and any of the respective heirs, successors
and assigns of the foregoing (collectively, the "Seller Indemnified Parties")
all Losses suffered or incurred by any Seller Indemnified Party, or to which
any Seller Indemnified Party otherwise becomes subject, as a result of,
arising out of or relating to:

(i) the inaccuracy or breach of any representation or warranty made by Buyer
in _Article_ __ _ VI_ of this Agreement;

(ii) any breach or failure by Buyer to perform any of its covenants or
obligations contained in this Agreement;

(iii) any (A) Assumed Liabilities (excluding, for the avoidance of doubt, any
Losses for which Seller is required to indemnify the Buyer Indemnified Parties
pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 13.01(a)_ _)_ or (B) Buyer Retained Current
Liability; or 

(iv) any payment of severance (as such term is defined in Treasury Regulation
§ 1.280G-1, QandA 44) by Buyer or any of its Affiliates to any Business
Employee which (A) is in excess of the severance that would be payable
pursuant to the arrangements of Seller and its Affiliates in effect as of
immediately prior to the Closing Date, (B) constitutes an excess parachute
payment (as such term is defined under Section 280G of the Code), after taking
into account the value of any relevant non-competition arrangements and other
mitigation available, and (C) results in actual Tax Losses to Seller.

 



120 (b) Notwithstanding any other provision to the contrary, Buyer shall not be
required to indemnify or hold harmless any Seller Indemnified Party against
any Losses pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 13.02(a)(i)_ (other than Losses arising
solely as a result of the inaccuracy or breach of any representation or
warranty made by Buyer in  _Section_ __ _ 6.01_ or _Section_ __ _ 6.08_, as
to which the limitations in this sentence shall not apply) (i) with respect to
any claim (or series of related claims arising from substantially the
same underlying facts, events or circumstances), unless such claim (or series
of related claims arising from substantially the same underlying facts, events
or circumstances) involves Losses in excess of $250,000 and (ii) until the
aggregate amount of the Seller Indemnified Parties Losses exceeds
$4,700,000, after which Buyer shall, subject to the immediately succeeding
sentence, be obligated to indemnify and hold harmless the Seller Indemnified
Parties against all Losses of the Seller Indemnified Parties that, in the
aggregate, are in excess of such amount. The cumulative aggregate liability of
Buyer under _Section_ __ _ 13.02(a)(i)_ shall in no event exceed $23,500,000
(other than in respect of Losses arising solely as a result of the inaccuracy
or breach of any representation or warranty made by Buyer in _Section_ __ _
6.01_ or _6.08_ , in which case, Buyers aggregate liability shall not exceed
$235,000,000). Notwithstanding any other provision to the contrary, Buyer
shall not be required to indemnify or hold harmless any Seller Indemnified
Party against any Losses pursuant to 
_Section_ __ _ 13.02(a)(iii)(A)_ other than Losses to the extent actually
paid or payable by a Seller Indemnified Party to Third Parties. For the
avoidance of doubt, Assumed Liabilities shall be deemed to include those
Liabilities arising from or relating to the operations of the Business
following Closing (notwithstanding that such operation is by Buyer and its
Affiliates) to the extent such Liabilities would have been Assumed Liabilities
of the Acquired Companies as of Closing if they existed as of the Closing (it
being understood and agreed that such Liabilities being Assumed Liabilities
shall not affect Buyers rights to indemnification under _Section_ __ _
13.01_).

 

Section 13.03 _Notification of_ _Claims_.

 

(a) A Person who may be entitled to be indemnified and held harmless under
_Section_ __ _ 13.01_ or  _Section_ __ _ 13.02_ (the "Indemnified Party"),
shall, as promptly as reasonably practical, notify the party that is
potentially liable therefor (the "Indemnifying Party") in writing of
any pending or threatened Action, claim, investigation, proceeding or demand
by a Third Party that the Indemnified Party has determined has given or could
reasonably give rise to such a right under this Agreement (including a pending
or threatened claim or demand asserted by a Third Party against the
Indemnified Party, such claim being a "Third-Party Claim"), describing in
reasonable detail, to the extent then known, the facts and circumstances with
respect to the subject matter of such claim or demand; _provided_ , that the
failure to provide such notice shall not release the Indemnifying Party from
any of its obligations under this _Article_ __ _ XIII_ except to the extent
the Indemnifying Party is actually prejudiced by such failure, it being
understood that notices for claims in respect of a breach of a representation,
warranty, covenant or agreement must be delivered prior to the expiration of
any applicable survival period specified in _Section_ __ _ 14.01_ for such
representation, warranty, covenant or agreement. Following delivery of a
notice of a Third-Party Claim, the Indemnified Party shall deliver to the
Indemnifying Party, reasonably promptly after the Indemnified Partys receipt
thereof, copies of all non-privileged notices and documents (including court
papers) received by the Indemnified Party relating to such Third-Party Claim;
provided, that the failure to provide such copies on a timely basis shall not
affect the indemnification provided under this Agreement except to the extent
the Indemnifying Party is actually prejudiced by such failure.

 



121 (b) Following receipt of a notice of a Third-Party Claim from an Indemnified
Party pursuant to  _Section_ __ _ 13.03(a)_, the Indemnifying Party may
assume the defense and control of such Third-Party Claim at any time by
delivery of written notice to the Indemnified Party (which notice shall
irrevocably acknowledge the Indemnifying Partys responsibility for such
Third Party Claim without reservation of rights but subject to the monetary
limitations set forth in this _Article_ __ _ XIII_); _provided_ that, such
Indemnifying Party shall (at its sole cost and expense) have the right to be
reasonably informed by the Indemnified Party of the status of such claim and
any non-privileged material facts related thereto brought forth in discovery
or otherwise until assumed under this  _Section_ __ _ 13.03(b)_; _provided_
, _further_ , that the Indemnifying Party shall not be entitled to assume or
maintain control of the defense of any Third-Party Claim and shall pay the
reasonable fees and expenses of counsel retained by the Indemnified Party to
the extent (i) the Third-Party Claim is or relates to Taxes or any potential
criminal Action, inquiry or investigation against the Indemnified Party (any
such fees and expenses paid by the Indemnifying Party shall be considered
Losses to which the limitations in this _Article_ __ _ XIII_ apply); (ii)
such Third-Party Claim seeks injunctive or other equitable relief against the
Indemnified Party; (iii) such Indemnified Party concludes based on the advice
of outside counsel that a conflict of interest exists between the Indemnifying
Party and the Indemnified Party ; (iv) an adverse determination with respect
to such Third-Party Claim would reasonably be expected to materially injure
the Indemnified Partys relationship with its current or prospective business
relations; (v) the Losses relating to such Third-Party Claim together with all
other indemnification claims made would reasonably be expected to exceed the
maximum amount that the Indemnified Party would be entitled to recover under
this _Article_ __ _ XIII_; (vi) such Third Party Claim relates to Taxes; or
(vii) the defense or prosecution of such Third-Party Claim has been tendered
to Buyers or its Affiliates insurance carrier and such insurance carrier has
assumed the defense thereunder pursuant to such applicable insurance policy
and Seller will have no monetary obligation with respect to such defense.

(c) The Indemnified Party may take any actions reasonably necessary to defend
such Third-Party Claim prior to the time that it receives a notice from the
Indemnifying Party as contemplated by _Section_ __ _ 13.03(b)_. If the
Indemnifying Party assumes the defense of any Third-Party Claim, the
Indemnifying Party shall allow the Indemnified Party a reasonable opportunity
to participate in the defense of such Third-Party Claim with its own counsel
and at its own expense, and the Indemnifying Party shall not be liable to the
Indemnified Party for legal expenses subsequently incurred by the Indemnified
Party in connection with the defense thereof (it being understood and agreed
that even if the Indemnified Party participates in the defense of such a
Third-Party Claim, the Indemnifying Party shall control the defense and
all decisions with respect thereto). Seller or Buyer, as the case may be,
shall, and shall cause each of its Affiliates and shall direct its
Representatives to, reasonably cooperate with the Indemnifying Party in the
defense of any Third-Party Claim. Without limiting the generality of the
foregoing, from and after the delivery of a notice of a claim for
indemnification with respect to any Third-Party Claim, at the reasonable
request of the Indemnifying Party, each Indemnified Party shall grant the
Indemnifying Party and its Representatives reasonable access, during normal
business hours, to the non-privileged books, records, personnel and properties
of the Indemnified Party to the extent reasonably related to such claim, at
no cost to the Indemnifying Party (other than for reasonable out-of-pocket
expenses of the Indemnified Parties). The Indemnifying Party shall be
authorized to consent to a settlement of, or the entry of any judgment arising
from, any Third-Party Claim, without the consent of any Indemnified Party;
_provided_ that (i) such settlement does not involve any admission of guilt
or wrongdoing on the part of the Indemnified Party and provides only for

 



122  the payment of monetary damages (and does not impose any injunctive relief
or otherwise impose any conditions or restrictions on the applicable
Indemnified Party), (ii) the Indemnifying Party pays or causes to be paid all
amounts arising out of such settlement or judgment concurrently with the
effectiveness of such settlement (subject to the limitations in this
Agreement, including those in  _Section_ __ _ 13.01(b)_ or _Section_ __ _
13.02(b)_), and (iii) the Indemnifying Party obtains, as a condition of any
settlement or other resolution, a complete and unconditional release of each
Indemnified Party from any and all liability in respect of such Third-Party
Claim.

(d) No Indemnifying Party shall have any liability under this  _Article_ __ _
XIII_ for any Losses arising out of or in connection with any Third-Party
Claim that is settled or compromised by an Indemnified Party without the prior
written consent of such Indemnifying Party (such consent not to be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed).

(e) If an Indemnified Party wishes to make a claim under this  _Article_ __ _
XIII_ that does not involve a Third-Party Claim, the Indemnified Party shall
give written notice to the Indemnifying Party setting forth (i) a reasonably
detailed description of the claim, to the extent then known and (ii) a good
faith estimate of the amount of the claim (to the extent ascertainable), and
such notice shall be accompanied by copies of all available and non-privileged
documentation that may be necessary or appropriate for the purposes of
enabling the Indemnifying Party to be informed and to take any and all
appropriate decisions and actions in respect of the matter and Loss that is
the subject of the claim; _provided_ , that the failure to provide such
notice on a timely basis shall not release the Indemnifying Party from any of
its obligations under this _Article_ __ _ XIII_ except to the extent the
Indemnifying Party is actually prejudiced by such failure, it being
understood that notices for claims in respect of a breach of a representation,
warranty, covenant or agreement must be delivered prior to the expiration of
any applicable survival period specified in  _Section_ __ _ 14.01_ for such
representation, warranty, covenant or agreement.

(f) The provisions of  _Section_ __ _ 10.03_ shall control with respect to
Tax audits, proceedings, claims and contests.

Section 13.04  _Payment_. In the event an Action under this _Article_ __ _
XIII_ shall have been finally determined, the amount of such final
determination shall be paid to the Indemnified Party on demand in immediately
available funds. An Action, and the liability for and amount of damages
therefor, shall be deemed to be "finally determined" for purposes of this
_Article_ __ _ XIII_ when the parties to such Action have so determined by
mutual agreement or, if disputed, when a final nonappealable Governmental
Order shall have been entered.

Section 13.05 _No Duplication; Exclusive Remedies_.

(a) Any liability for indemnification hereunder and under any other
Transaction Agreement shall be determined without duplication of recovery by
reason of the same Loss. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement
to the contrary, Seller shall not be required to indemnify or hold harmless
any Buyer Indemnified Party against any Losses to the extent such Loss is
specifically taken into account in the Closing Adjustment or the Post-Closing
Adjustment.

 



123 (b) Following the Closing, and except for breaches or non-performance of
provisions in this Agreement for which the remedy of specific performance is
available pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 14.14_, the indemnification provisions
of  _Article_ __ _ XIII_ and, with respect to Taxes, _Article_ __ _ X_,
shall be the sole and exclusive remedies of Seller and Buyer, respectively,
for any breach of the representations or warranties in this Agreement and for
any failure to perform or comply with any covenants or agreements contained in
this Agreement. In furtherance of the foregoing, each of Buyer, on behalf of
itself and each other Buyer Indemnified Party, and Seller, on behalf of itself
and each other Seller Indemnified Party, hereby waives, from and after the
Closing, to the fullest extent permitted under applicable Law, any and all
rights, claims and causes of action it may have against Seller or any of its
Affiliates or Representatives and Buyer or any of its Affiliates or
Representatives, as the case may be, arising under or based upon this
Agreement, any certificate or instrument delivered in connection herewith
(whether under this Agreement or arising under common Law or any other
applicable Law), except pursuant to: (i) the indemnification provisions set
forth in this _Article_ __ _ XIII_ or (ii) as provided under (A) the
provisions of  _Section_ __ _ 2.06_, (B) the provisions of _Article_ __ _
X_, (C) the provisions hereof providing for equitable remedies or (D) the
provisions of any other Transaction Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing
or anything in this Agreement to the contrary, nothing in this Agreement shall
preclude any Buyer Indemnified Party or Seller Indemnified Party from pursuing
any claim or seeking any remedy arising from or related to fraud in the
making of the representations, warranties, covenants or agreements under this
Agreement.

Section 13.06 _Additional Indemnification Provisions_.

(a) With respect to each indemnification obligation in this Agreement, all
Losses shall be net of (i) any Eligible Insurance Proceeds (other than from
self-insurance policies) and (ii) only with respect to Losses relating to the
Acquired Companies that were formed or organized outside the United States
(other than Thoreau Consulting Hong Kong), any net Tax benefit actually
realized by the Indemnified Party (or an Affiliate thereof) solely ( _i.e._ ,
determined on a "with or without" basis) as a result of sustaining or paying
the Loss giving rise to the applicable indemnification obligation, but only
to the extent such net Tax benefit is actually realized in the taxable period
of such Loss.

(b) In any case where an Indemnified Party recovers from a third Person any
amount in respect of any Loss paid by the Indemnifying Party pursuant to this
_Article_ __ _ XIII_, such Indemnified Party shall promptly pay over to
the Indemnifying Party the amount so recovered (after deducting therefrom the
amount of reasonable costs incurred by it in procuring such recovery, which
costs shall not exceed the amount so recovered), but not in excess of the sum
of (i) any amount previously paid by the Indemnifying Party to or on behalf
of the Indemnified Party in respect of such claim and (ii) any amount expended
by the Indemnifying Party in pursuing or defending any claim arising out of
such Loss.

 

(c) The parties shall treat any indemnification payment made under this
Agreement as an adjustment to the Base Purchase Price, unless
otherwise required by applicable Law.

(d) If any portion of Losses to be paid by the Indemnifying Party pursuant to
this  _Article_ __ _ XIII_ may be covered, in whole or in part, by third-
party insurance coverage, the Indemnified Party shall promptly give notice
thereof to the Indemnifying Party. The Indemnified Party shall use reasonable
best efforts to collect the maximum amount of insurance proceeds

 



124  thereunder, and all such proceeds actually collected in respect of any Loss
(net of (i) the amount of reasonable costs incurred by the Indemnified Party
or its Affiliates in collecting such proceeds and (ii) the present value of
any increased costs incurred by such Indemnified Party or its Affiliates as a
result of such Loss, including any retroactive or prospective premium
adjustments resulting from such Loss) shall be considered "Eligible Insurance
Proceeds"; _provided_ , that the foregoing will not require the Indemnified
Party to institute any Action against any insurance provider.

 

(e) For purposes of determining whether any representation and warranty has
been breached or is inaccurate and for purposes of calculating the amount of
any Loss under this _Article_ __ _ XIII_, each representation and warranty
contained in this Agreement shall be read without regard to any "materiality,"
"Company Material Adverse Effect," "Buyer Material Adverse Effect" or
qualifications to "material" or "in all material respects" contained in or
otherwise applicable to such representation or warranty, other than (i) the
representation and warranty in  _Section_ __ _ 5.03_, _Section_ __ _
5.04(b)_ or _Section_ __ _ 5.16_, (ii) any Listing Representation and (iii)
any use of the defined term "Material Contract" or "Material Customer" or the
use of "material" in any defined term.

Section 13.07 _Mitigation_. Each of the parties to this Agreement shall, and
shall cause its applicable Affiliates and Representatives to, take
commercially reasonable steps to mitigate their respective Losses to the
extent required by applicable Law upon and after becoming aware of any fact,
event, circumstance or condition that has given rise to, or would reasonably
be expected to give rise to, any Losses that are indemnifiable hereunder.

 

ARTICLE XIV

 

GENERAL PROVISIONS

 

Section 14.01 _Survival_. The representations and warranties of Seller and
Buyer contained in or made pursuant to this Agreement or in any certificate
furnished pursuant to this Agreement (other than (a) the Specified
Representations, which shall survive the Closing indefinitely, (b) _ Section_
__ _ 5.17_, which shall survive the Closing until the sixty (60) days after
the expiration of the applicable statute of limitations (as extended) and (c)
_ Section_ __ _ 5.16_, which shall survive the Closing and terminate on the
date that is eighteen (18) months after the Closing Date) shall survive the
Closing and terminate on the date that is twelve (12) months after the Closing
Date (and no claims shall be made for indemnification with respect thereto
under _Sections 13.01_ or _13.02_ thereafter unless a notice of claim has
been delivered prior to the expiration of such applicable survival period
pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 13.03(a)_ or _Section_ __ _ 13.03(e)_, as the
case may be, in which case the claim shall continue to be subject to
indemnification in accordance with _Article_ __ _ XIII_ notwithstanding the
expiration of such survival period). The covenants and agreements that by
their terms apply or are to be performed in whole or in part after the
Closing shall, to such extent, survive the Closing and remain in effect for
the period provided in such covenants and agreements, if any, or if later,
until fully performed.

 

Section 14.02 _Expenses_. Except as may be otherwise specified in the
Transaction Agreements, all costs and expenses, including fees and
disbursements of counsel, financial advisers and independent accountants,

contemplated by the Transaction Agreements shall be paid by the Person
incurring such costs and expenses, whether or not the Closing shall have
occurred or this

 



125  Agreement is terminated. For the avoidance of doubt, all expenses related to
the Reorganization shall be borne by Seller

 

Section 14.03 _Notices_. All notices, requests, consents, claims, demands,
waivers and other communications under the Transaction Agreements shall be in

original via overnight courier service) or by registered or certified mail

Section 14.04 _Public Announcements_. No party to this Agreement or any
Affiliate or Representative of such party shall issue or cause the
publication of any press release or public announcement or otherwise
communicate with any news media in respect of this Agreement or the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement without the prior written consent
of the other party (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed), except as may be required by Law or applicable
securities exchange rules, in which the case the party required to publish
such press release or public announcement shall allow the other parties a
reasonable opportunity to comment on such press release or public announcement
in advance of such publication. Prior to the Closing, neither of the parties
to this Agreement, nor any of their respective Affiliates or Representatives,
shall make any public disclosure concerning plans or intentions relating to
the customers, agents or employees of, or other Persons with significant
business relationships with, the Business or the Acquired Companies without
first obtaining the prior written approval of the other party, which approval
shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed.

 

Section 14.05 _Severability_. If any term or other provision of this Agreement
is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced under any Law or as a
matter of public policy, all other conditions and provisions of this Agreement
shall nevertheless remain in full force and effect so long as the economic,
risk allocation, limitation of liability or legal substance of
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement is not affected in any manner
materially adverse to any party. Upon such determination that any term or
other provision is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced, the
parties to this Agreement shall negotiate in good faith to modify this
Agreement so as to effect the original intent of the parties as closely as
possible in a mutually acceptable manner in order that the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement be consummated as originally contemplated to
the greatest extent possible.

Section 14.06 _Entire_ _Agreement_. Except as otherwise expressly provided in
the Transaction Agreements, the Transaction Agreements and any certificate
delivered hereunder and thereunder constitute the entire agreement of the
parties hereto with respect to the subject matter of the Transaction
Agreements and supersede all prior agreements and undertakings, both written
and oral (other than the Confidentiality Agreement to the extent not in
conflict with this Agreement), between or on behalf of Seller and/or its
Affiliates, on the one hand, and Buyer and/or its Affiliates, on the other
hand, with respect to the subject matter of the Transaction Agreements.

Section 14.07  _Assignment_. This Agreement shall not be assigned by any
party hereto without the prior written consent of the other party hereto. Any
attempted assignment in violation of this _Section_ __ _ 14.07_ shall be
void. Notwithstanding the foregoing, (x) Seller may assign this Agreement in
connection with any sale of all or substantially all of the assets of Seller
and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, or in connection with any merger or
consolidation involving Seller, provided that no such assignment shall
relieve Seller of its obligations hereunder to the extent such

 



127  assignee fails to perform and (y) Buyer may assign this Agreement and any
Transaction Agreement, in whole or in part, and any or all rights and
obligations, in whole or in part, under this Agreement or any of the
Transaction Agreements (including Buyers rights to acquire the Equity
Interests) to any of its Affiliates unless such assignment would be reasonably
expected to cause a Buyer Material Adverse Effect, and no such assignment
shall relieve Buyer of its obligations hereunder to the extent such Affiliate
fails to perform; provided, further, that Buyer (or its Affiliate) shall have
the right to assign all or any portion of its rights and obligations to
this Agreement from and after the Closing to any Debt Financing Sources or in
connection with any sale of all or substantially all of the assets of Buyer
and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, or in connection with any merger or
consolidation (in each case, so long as Buyer or its Affiliate, as
applicable, is not relieved of its obligations hereunder). This Agreement
shall be binding upon, shall inure to the benefit of, and shall be enforceable
by the parties hereto and their permitted successors and assigns.

Section 14.08 _No Third-Party Beneficiaries_. Except as provided in _Section_
__ _ 8.10_ with respect to the directors, officers and managers of the
Acquired Companies and _Article_ __ _ XIII_ with respect to the Seller
Indemnified Parties and Buyer Indemnified Parties, this Agreement is for the
sole benefit of the parties to this Agreement and their permitted successors
and assigns and nothing in this Agreement, express or implied, is intended to
or shall confer upon any other Person or entity any legal or equitable right,
benefit or remedy of any nature whatsoever under or by reason of this
Agreement; _provided_ that, notwithstanding the foregoing, each Debt Financing
Source shall be an express third party beneficiary with respect to _Sections
12.03(c)_ , the second sentence of  _Section_ __ _ 14.07_, the last sentence
of Section _ 14.09_, _14.11(e)_ , the last sentence of Section _ 14.12_,
_14.13_ , the last sentence of _Section_ __ _ 14.14_, the last sentence of
_Section_ __ _ 14.15_, _Section_ __ _ 14.19_ and this _Section_ __ _ 14.08_
(collectively, the "DFS Provisions"). Without limiting the generality of the
foregoing, the representations and warranties in this Agreement are the
product of negotiations between the parties to this Agreement and are for the
sole benefit of the parties to this Agreement. Any inaccuracies in or breaches
of such representations or warranties are subject to waiver by the parties to
this Agreement in accordance with this Agreement without notice or Liability
to any other Person. In some instances, the representations and warranties in
this Agreement may represent an allocation among the parties hereto of risks
associated with particular matters regardless of the knowledge of any party
hereto. Consequently, Persons other than the parties hereto may not rely upon
the representations and warranties in this Agreement as characterizations of
actual facts or circumstances as of the date of this Agreement or as of any
other date.

Section 14.09  _Amendment_. No provision of this Agreement or any other
Transaction Agreement may be amended, supplemented or modified except by a
written instrument signed by all the parties to such agreement. No consent
from any Indemnified Party under  _Article_ __ _ X_ (other than the parties
to this Agreement) shall be required in order to amend this Agreement.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the foregoing, no DFS Provision
(or any other provision of this Agreement the amendment, modification or
waiver of which has the effect of modifying or terminating such DFS
Provisions) may be amended, modified, or waived in a manner that is adverse in
any material respect to any Debt Financing Sources without the prior written
consent of the Debt Financing Sources.

 



128 Section 14.10 _Schedules_. Any disclosure set forth or deemed to be set forth
in the Seller Disclosure Schedule with respect to any Section of this
Agreement shall be deemed to be disclosed for purposes of other Sections or
subsections of this Agreement to the extent that such disclosure sets forth
facts in sufficient detail so that the relevance of such disclosure would be
reasonably apparent to a reader of such disclosure. Matters reflected in any
Section of the Seller Disclosure Schedule are not necessarily limited to
matters required by this Agreement to be so reflected. Such additional
matters are set forth for informational purposes and do not necessarily
include other matters of a similar nature. No reference to or disclosure of
any item or other matter in the Seller Disclosure Schedule shall be construed
as an admission or indication that such item or other matter is material or
that such item or other matter is required to be referred to or disclosed in
this Agreement. Without limiting the foregoing, no such reference to or
disclosure of a possible breach or violation of any Contract, Law or
Governmental Order shall be construed as an admission or indication that a
breach or violation exists or has actually occurred.

 

Section 14.11 _Submission to Jurisdiction_.

 

(a) Each of the parties hereto irrevocably and unconditionally submits for
itself and its property in any Action arising out of or relating to the
Transaction Agreements, the transactions contemplated by the Transaction
Agreements, the formation, breach, termination or validity of the Transaction
Agreements or the recognition and enforcement of any judgment in respect of
the Transaction Agreement, to the exclusive jurisdiction of the Delaware
Court of Chancery in and for New Castle County, or in the event (but only in
the event) that such Delaware Court of Chancery does not have subject matter
jurisdiction over such Action, the United States District Court for the
District of Delaware, or in the event (but only in the event) that such United
States District Court also does not have subject matter jurisdiction over such
Action, any Delaware State court sitting in New Castle County, and appellate
courts having jurisdiction of appeals from any of the foregoing.

(b) Any such Action may and shall be brought in such courts and each of the
parties irrevocably and unconditionally waives any objection that it may now
or hereafter have to the venue or jurisdiction of any such Action in any such
court or that such Action was brought in an inconvenient court and shall not
plead or claim the same.

(c) Service of process in any Action may be effected by mailing a copy
of such process by registered or certified mail (or any substantially similar
form of mail), postage prepaid, to such party at its address as provided in
_Section_ __ _ 14.03_.

 

(d) Nothing in this Agreement or any other Transaction Agreement shall affect
the right to effect service of process in any other manner permitted by the
Laws of the State of Delaware.

(e) Notwithstanding the foregoing, each party hereto agrees that it will not
bring or support any Action, cause of action, cross-claim or third-party
claim of any kind or description, whether in law or in equity, whether in
contract or in tort or otherwise, against the Debt Financing Sources (in their
capacity as such) in any way relating to this Agreement, including any
dispute arising out of the Debt Commitment Letters or the performance thereof,
in any forum other than the Supreme Court of the State of New York, County of
New York, or, if under applicable law exclusive jurisdiction is vested in the
Federal courts, the United States District Court for the Southern District of
New York (and of the appropriate appellate courts therefrom).

 



129 Section 14.12 _Governing_ _Law_. This Agreement, and the formation,
termination or validity of any part of this Agreement, shall in all respects
be governed by, and construed in accordance with, the Laws of the State of
Delaware, without giving effect to any choice of law or conflict of law rules
or provisions (whether of the State of Delaware or any other jurisdiction)
that would result in the application of the Laws of any jurisdiction other
than the State of Delaware. Notwithstanding the foregoing, each of the parties
to this Agreement agrees that except as specifically set forth in the Debt
Commitment Letters, all Actions or cause of action (whether at law, in equity,
in contract, in tort or otherwise) against any of the Debt Financing Sources
(in their capacity as such) in any way relating to this Agreement, the Debt
Financing or the performance thereof or the transactions contemplated hereby
or thereby shall in each case be exclusively governed by, and construed in
accordance with, the internal laws of the State of New York, without
giving effect to principles or rules of conflict of laws to the extent such
principles or rules would require or permit the application of laws of another
jurisdiction.

 

Section 14.13 _Waiver of Jury Trial_. EACH PARTY HERETO IRREVOCABLY AND
UNCONDITIONALLY WAIVES ANY AND ALL RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY ACTION
(WHETHER BASED ON CONTRACT, TORT OR OTHERWISE) ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO
THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED BY THIS AGREEMENT (OR THE DEBT FINANCING) OR ANY
OTHER TRANSACTION AGREEMENTS, OR ITS PERFORMANCE UNDER OR THE ENFORCEMENT OF
THIS AGREEMENT (OR THE DEBT FINANCING) OR ANY OTHER TRANSACTION AGREEMENT.

Section 14.14 _Specific Performance_. The parties agree that irreparable
damage would occur in the event that any of the covenants or obligations
contained in this Agreement are not performed in accordance with their
specific terms or were otherwise breached. Accordingly, each of the parties
hereto shall be entitled to injunctive or other equitable relief to prevent
or cure any breach by the other party of its covenants or obligations
contained in this Agreement and to specifically enforce such covenants and
obligations in any court referenced in  _Section_ __ _ 14.11(a)_ having
jurisdiction, such remedy being in addition to any other remedy to which any
party may be entitled at law or in equity. The parties acknowledge and agree
that, in the event that the other party seeks an injunction or injunctions to
prevent breaches of this Agreement or to enforce specifically the terms and
provisions of this Agreement, the party seeking an injunction will not be
required to provide any bond or other security in connection with any such
order or injunction. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the
contrary, the parties hereto hereby agree that Seller shall only be entitled
to specific performance of Buyers obligations to, or any other equitable
remedy which would, cause the Equity Financing to be funded or to effect the
Closing if, and only if, (i) all the conditions in _Section_ __ _ 11.02_ have
been satisfied or waived (other than those conditions that by their nature are
to be satisfied at the Closing, each of which conditions at such time are
capable of being satisfied if the Closing were to then immediately occur or
those conditions that are not satisfied because of breaches of this Agreement
by Buyer or any of its Affiliates) at the time the Closing is required to
have occurred pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 3.01_ and Buyer fails to complete
the Closing on the date it is required to have occurred pursuant to 
_Section_ __ _ 3.01_, (ii) the Debt Financing has been funded to Buyer or
will be funded to Buyer at the Closing if the Equity Financing is funded at
the Closing and (iii) Seller has irrevocably confirmed in writing to
Buyer that if specific performance is granted and the Financing (including
any replacement financing that has been obtained in accordance with _Section_
__ _ 8.09_) is funded, then Seller will cause the Closing to occur pursuant
to  _Section_ __ _ 3.01_ and (iv) the Termination Fee has not been paid by
or

 



130  on behalf of Buyer and accepted by Seller. For the avoidance of doubt, in no
event shall Seller, the Acquired Companies or any of their respective
Affiliates be entitled to enforce or seek to enforce specifically Buyers
obligations to cause the Equity Financing to be funded if the Debt Financing
has not been funded (and will not be funded at the Closing if the Equity
Financing is funded at the Closing). Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
set forth herein, in no event shall Seller or any of its Affiliates (including
the Acquired Companies prior to the Closing) or its or their respective
Representatives be entitled to, or permitted to seek, specific performance of
any Debt Financing Source or Equity Financing Sources, except in each case
indirectly through the enforcement of Buyers obligations hereunder and in the
limited circumstances expressly set forth in this _Section_ __ _ 14.14_. 

Section 14.15 _Waivers_. Any term or provision of this Agreement may be
waived, or the time for its performance may be extended, in writing at any
time by the party or parties entitled to the benefit thereof. Any such waiver
shall be validly and sufficiently authorized for the purposes of this
Agreement if, as to any party, it is authorized in writing by an authorized
Representative of such party. The failure of any party hereto to enforce at
any time any provision of this Agreement shall not be construed to be a waiver
of such provision, nor in any way to affect the validity of this Agreement or
any part hereof or the right of any party thereafter to enforce each and
every such provision. No waiver of any breach of this Agreement shall be held
to constitute a waiver of any preceding or subsequent breach. Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary in the foregoing, no DFS Provision (or any other
provision of this Agreement the waiver of which has the effect of waiving or
modifying such DFS Provisions) may be waived in a manner that is adverse in
any material respect to any Debt Financing Sources without the prior written
consent of such Debt Financing Source.

Agreements may be executed in two (2) or more counterparts, and by the
different parties to each such agreement in separate counterparts, each of
which when executed shall be deemed to be an original but all of which taken
together shall constitute one and the same agreement. Delivery of an executed
counterpart of a signature page to any Transaction Agreement by email or other
electronic transmission shall be as effective as delivery of a manually
executed counterpart of any such Agreement. No party hereto or to any such
agreement or instrument will raise the fact that any signature or agreement
or instrument was transmitted or communicated through the use of an electronic
transmission in PDF as a defense to the formation or enforceability of a
contract and each such party forever waives any such defense. Minor
variations in the form of the signature page to this Agreement or any
Transaction Agreement, including footers from earlier versions of this
Agreement or any such other document, will be disregarded in determining the
effectiveness of such signature. At the request of any party hereto or to any
such agreement or instrument, each other party hereto or thereto will re-
execute original forms thereof and deliver them to all other parties hereto.

134 Section 14.20 _Concerning_ _Counsel_.

 

(a) Recognizing that Sidley Austin LLP ("Counsel") has acted as legal counsel
to Seller and the Acquired Companies (collectively, the "Clients") for
various matters prior to Closing, including in connection with this Agreement
and the transactions contemplated hereby (collectively, the "Pre-
Closing Engagements"), and in that connection not as counsel for any other
Person, including Buyer or its Affiliates, only the Clients shall be
considered clients of Counsel for purposes of the Pre-Closing Engagements. If
Seller or its applicable Affiliate so desires, and without the need for any
consent or waiver by Buyer or the Acquired Companies, Counsel shall be
permitted to represent Seller after the Closing in connection with any
matter, including anything related to the transactions contemplated hereby or
any disagreement or dispute in connection therewith or any other matter
relating to a Pre-Closing Engagement. Without limiting the generality of the
foregoing, after the Closing, Counsel shall be permitted to represent Seller
and any of its Affiliates or Representatives, in connection with any
negotiation, transaction or Dispute with Buyer, the Acquired Companies or any
of their respective Affiliates or Representatives relating to any Pre-Closing
Engagements, including indemnification claims or any other matter related to
this Agreement, any other Transaction Agreement or the transactions
contemplated hereby or thereby. Buyer, on behalf of itself and its Affiliates,
including the Acquired Companies, hereby consents to the disclosure to Seller
and its Affiliates and Representatives by Counsel of any information learned
by Counsel in the course of its representation of the Clients, whether or not
such information is subject to the attorney-client privilege or Counsels duty
of confidentiality and whether such disclosure is made before or after the
Closing.

 

(b) Buyer, on behalf of itself and its Affiliates further agrees that all
communications in any form or format whatsoever between or among Counsel,
Seller or the Acquired Companies, or any of their respective Affiliates or
Representatives, that relate in any way to the negotiation, documentation and
consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or any dispute
arising under this Agreement (collectively, the "Deal Communications") shall
be deemed to be retained and owned by Seller, shall be controlled by Seller
and shall not pass to or be claimed by the Acquired Companies, Buyer or any of
their respective Affiliates, and none of the Acquired Companies, Buyer or any
of its respective Affiliates shall have access to any such Deal
Communications, or to the files of Counsel relating thereto. Buyer, on behalf
of itself and its Affiliates (including the Acquired Companies) irrevocably
waives any right it may have to discover or obtain information or
documentation relating to the representation of the Clients by Counsel
relating to any Deal Communications or any other matter related to this
Agreement, any other Transaction Agreement or the transactions contemplated
hereby or thereby. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing,
notwithstanding that the Acquired Companies may be a client in the Pre-Closing
Engagements, from and after the Closing, (i) Seller shall be the sole holder
of the attorney-client privilege with respect to Deal Communications that are
attorney-client privileged (the "Privileged Deal Communications") and the
expectation of client confidence relating to any Deal Communications, and none
of Buyer, the Acquired Companies or any of their respective Affiliates shall
be a holder thereof (provided that, with respect to any Third Party claim,
Seller shall provide reasonable cooperation to allow Buyer and its Affiliates
the benefit of any applicable Privileged Deal Communications), (ii) to the
extent that files of Counsel in respect of the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement would constitute property of the Clients, only Seller shall
hold such property rights, and (iii) Counsel shall have no duty whatsoever to
reveal or disclose any Deal Communications or such files to Buyer, the
Acquired Companies or any of their respective Affiliates by reason of any
attorney-client relationship between Counsel and the Acquired Companies or
otherwise. Notwithstanding

 



135  the foregoing, if the Acquired Companies, Buyer or any of their respective
Affiliates unintentionally or inadvertently come into possession of Privileged
Deal Communications and in the event that a dispute arises between the
Acquired Companies, Buyer or any of its respective Affiliates, on the one
hand, and a Third Party other than Seller or any of its Affiliates, on the
other hand, the Acquired Companies may assert the attorney-client privilege
to prevent the disclosure of the Privileged Deal Communications to such Third
Party. In the event that Buyer, the Acquired Companies or any of their
respective Affiliates are legally required by a Governmental Authority or
applicable Law or otherwise to access, obtain or disclose a copy of all or a
portion of the Deal Communications, Buyer shall cause the Acquired Companies
to, as promptly as reasonably possible, notify Seller in writing so that the
Seller can seek (at its sole expense) a protective order and Buyer shall, and
shall cause the Acquired Companies and its Affiliates to, use commercially
reasonable efforts to assist therewith.

 

(c) Seller on behalf of itself and its Affiliates (including the Acquired
Companies prior to the Closing) and Buyer on behalf of itself and
its Affiliates (including the Acquired Companies after the Closing) (i)
hereby consent to the foregoing arrangements and waive (and agree to cause
their respective Affiliates) any actual or potential conflict of interest that
may be involved in connection with any representation by Counsel permitted
hereunder. Buyer shall not seek or having, and shall cause its Affiliates
(including the Acquired Companies after the Closing) to refrain from seeking
or having, Counsel disqualified from any such representation based on the
prior representation of the Acquired Companies by Counsel.

Section 14.21 _Bulk Sales Laws_. Buyer and Seller each hereby waive
compliance by Seller or any of its Affiliates with the provisions of the "bulk
sales", "bulk transfer" or similar Laws of any state or any jurisdiction
outside the United States that may otherwise be applicable with respect to
the sale of any of the Transferred Assets. Seller agrees to fully indemnify
Buyer against all Liability resulting from a Third Party Claim which Buyer may
suffer due to Sellers failure to so comply or to provide notice required by
any such Law.

Section 14.22 _Time is of the Essence_. With respect to all dates and time
periods set forth or referred to in this Agreement, time is of the essence.

[THE REMAINDER OF THIS PAGE INTENTIONALLY LEFT BLANK]
