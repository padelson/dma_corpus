20 STATEMENT OF AGREEMENT

 

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of $10.00 in hand paid by Purchaser to
Seller, the respective representations, warranties, covenants and agreements
set forth in this Agreement, and other good and valuable consideration, the
receipt and sufficiency of which are hereby acknowledged, the Parties,
intending to be legally bound, hereby agree as follows:

 

1\. _Agreement of Purchase and Sale_. Subject to the provisions of this
Agreement, and for the consideration herein stated, at the Closing, Seller
agrees to sell or assign the following to Purchaser:

1.1 _Sale to PCT_. Seller agrees to sell all of the outstanding membership
interests (the "Timberlands III, LLC Interests") of Timberlands III, LLC, a
Delaware limited liability company and wholly-owned subsidiary of MWV
("Timberlands III, LLC"), and PCT agrees to purchase the Timberlands III, LLC
Interests from Seller.

1.2 _Transfer and Assignment to Marketing_. MWV agrees to transfer and assign
MWVs rights, interests and obligations in the Kapstone FSA and in the
Inbound Kapstone-Supporting FSAs to Marketing and Marketing agrees to accept
the assignment and assume the Kapstone FSA and the Inbound Kapstone-Supporting
FSAs from MWV.

 

1.3 _Transfer and Assignment to Highland Mineral_. Seller agrees to sell
Sellers rights, interests and obligations in the Mineral Rights to Highland
Mineral and Highland Mineral agrees to purchase the Mineral Rights that are
subject to the Mineral Leases pursuant to the terms of the West Virginia
Mineral Rights Deeds, subject to the Reserved Interests.

 

2\. _Purchase Price and Allocation_.

 

2.1 The aggregate purchase price (the "Purchase Price") to be paid by
Purchaser for the Timberlands, the Timber Reservations, the Timberlands
Contracts, the Mineral Rights and the Personal Property shall be Nine Hundred
Thirty-four Million One Hundred Two Thousand One Hundred Sixty-Three Dollars
($934,102,163.00), subject to adjustment as set forth in this Agreement, and
shall be payable to MWV as follows:

a. In exchange for the Installment Sale Timberlands, delivery by PCT to MWV at
Closing of an Installment Note ("Note") in the amount of $860,000,000 that is
substantially in the form attached hereto as _Exhibit_ 30 with such changes
(i) as are required to be made pursuant to Section 3.2(d) or (e), (ii) as the
Parties may otherwise reasonably agree from time to time for the purpose of
assisting MWV in any securitization or other financing of the Note that MWV
may enter into post-Closing and (iii) to reflect any applicable amendment to
the representations, warranties, covenants or events of default in the
Existing Term Loan Agreement or Existing Revolving Credit Agreement as agreed
between PCT and its lenders thereunder after the date hereof and prior to the
Closing Date _._ PCT shall issue the Note on the Closing Date to

 



21  MWV or, if MWV shall elect in its sole discretion, a designee that is a
wholly-owned Subsidiary of MWV. The interest rate on the Note shall be the
interest rate agreed to by PCT and MWV on or prior to the Closing Date (the
"Parties Agreed Rate"); provided, however, that in the event MWV and PCT are
unable to agree on the interest rate for any reason, such rate shall be the
interest rate determined on or prior to the Closing Date by Bank of America
Merrill Lynch and Goldman Sachs and Co., jointly, based on the all-in yield
(consisting of the 10 year United States Treasury rate plus a new issue credit
spread) equal to what PCT would be required to pay in a hypothetical
$860,000,000 new issue debt offering of ten (10) year public unsecured bonds
issued at par to large United States institutional investors (after giving
effect on a pro forma basis to the transactions contemplated herein and
capital structure of PCT on the Closing Date) (the "Banker Agreed Rate"). For
the avoidance of doubt, irrespective of whether the Parties Agreed Rate is
agreed by the Parties on the Closing Date, the Banker Agreed Rate will be
determined and acknowledged by the Parties on or prior to the Closing Date.

b. $5,002,163 by wire transfer of immediately available funds by PCT to MWV
at Closing to an account designated by MWV in exchange for certain Installment
Sale Timberlands;

c. $4,100,000 by wire transfer of immediately available funds by PCT to MWV
at Closing to an account designated by MWV in exchange for the Non-Installment
Sale Timberlands;

 

d. $10,000,000 by wire transfer of immediately available funds by PCT to MWV
at Closing to an account designated by MWV in exchange for the Timberlands
Contracts; and

e. $55,000,000 by wire transfer of immediately available funds by Highland
Mineral to MWV at the Closing to an account designated by MWV in exchange for
the Mineral Rights.

Purchaser may, at its election, make the 2.1(b) through (e) wire transfers
with one (1) wire transfer of immediately available funds equal to the
aggregate amount of 2.1(b) through (e).

2.2 For the avoidance of doubt, the Parties acknowledge and agree that no
portion of the Cash Consideration is exchanged for the Installment Sale
Timberlands and no portion of the Note is exchanged for any Assets other than
the Installment Sale Timberlands.

 

3\. _Note, Note Securitization and Cooperation_.

 

3.1 On or before the date which is sixty (60) days following the Closing Date,
Seller will provide Purchaser with (i) audited financial statements of the
CDLM LLC business segment of which the Assets are a part (the "CDLM Business
Segment") consisting of balance sheets as of December 31, 2011 and December
31, 2012, statements of operations for the years ended December 31, 2011 and
December 31, 2012, statements of cash

 



22  flow for the years ended December 31, 2011 and December 31, 2012 and note
disclosures thereto as required by GAAP, and (ii) unaudited financial
statements of the CDLM Business Segment including a balance sheet as of June
30, 2013, and statements of operations and cash flow for the six months ended

GAAP. If the Closing Date is subsequent to November 11, 2013, the periods of
the unaudited financial statements set forth in this Section 3 shall be
adjusted as necessary to conform to the SEC reporting requirements of PCT.
Seller shall promptly notify Purchaser of any significant accounting issues
identified during the preparation of such financial statements. Seller will
reasonably cooperate with PCT and provide such financial information and
materials as PCT may reasonably request and that are customary prior to or
after Closing for PCTs accounting purposes.

3.2 (a) From the Effective Date until one hundred thirty-five (135) days
following the Closing Date, PCT shall provide, shall cause its Affiliates and
its and their respective officers and employees to provide, and shall use its
reasonable best efforts to cause its and their directors, managers,
lawyers, accountants, financial advisors and other advisors to provide, any
and all cooperation that is reasonably requested by MWV to assist MWV or any
of its Affiliates in connection with any securitization of the Note in the
bond market or bank financing in connection with which the Note is pledged as
collateral (each a "Note Financing"); provided, that no such cooperation shall
be required to the extent it would (i) unreasonably interfere in the conduct
of the business or operations of PCT, (ii) require PCT to pay any fees or
incur any out-of-pocket expenses unless MWV shall reimburse PCT for the same
or (iii) in connection with any Note Financing other than with lenders in the
Farm Credit System result in the disclosure of, or compel PCT to disclose,
any otherwise non-public PCT Information (as defined below) during any "black
out" period instituted by PCT in accordance with policies and procedures
established by it in the ordinary course of business and, to the extent
applicable, consistent with past practice, provided that PCT shall not be
obligated to make any such disclosures to any lender in the Farm Credit System
that has not executed a customary confidentiality agreement on terms and
conditions reasonably acceptable to PCT. Without limitation of the foregoing,
such cooperation shall include, (w) participating in a reasonable number of
meetings, presentations and due diligence sessions with any potential
financing sources in connection with a Note Financing and rating agencies,
(x) providing reasonable and timely assistance with the preparation of
materials for presentations, offering memoranda, prospectuses and similar
documents prepared in connection with any Note Financing and providing
customary authorization and representation letters in connection with any PCT
Information included in such materials, (y) making such changes to the Note
after the Closing Date as the parties thereto shall reasonably agree from
time to time for the purpose of assisting MWV in any Note Financing that MWV
may enter into post-Closing (including, as applicable, to conform the
representations, covenants and events of default contained in the Note to
the Existing Revolving Credit Agreement or Existing Term Loan Agreement, as
then in effect), and (z) providing customary legal opinions and, with respect
to the Note Legal Opinions, related reliance letters, in each case, for the
benefit of the financing sources in connection with any Note Financing.
Notwithstanding anything in this Section to the contrary, PCT will not be
required: (i) to provide any information other than (w) information included
in its most recent 10-Q or 10-K

 



23  and any subsequent 8-Ks, (x) additional information required to make such
information not materially misleading or to eliminate any material omission,
(y) information (A) of the type that PCT customarily provides in connection
with its financings of a similar type, (B) that is reasonably requested by MWV
to assist MWV or any of its Affiliates in connection with any potential Note
Financing and (C) with respect to which the recipients thereof execute a
customary confidentiality agreement, and (z) solely in connection with a bank
financing, financial projections for the five (5) year period following the
Closing Date, prepared by PCT in good faith based upon assumptions that it
believes to be reasonable at the time such financial projections are furnished
and giving effect on a pro forma basis to the transactions contemplated herein
and capital structure of PCT on the Closing Date (collectively, the "PCT
Information"); or (ii) to make any covenants, representations and warranties
or indemnities to or for the benefit of any person except (x) any covenants,
representations, warranties and indemnities made in the Note; provided that
any such representations and warranties may be modified or qualified to the
extent necessary to make such representations true and correct as of the date
made or deemed to be made in connection with any Note Financing, and (y) in
connection with any securitization of the Note in the bond market, customary
indemnities for any losses under applicable securities laws incurred by MWV or
its Affiliates directly resulting from any material misstatement or material
omission in any PCT Information provided in writing by PCT to MWV and
specifically designated by PCT for inclusion in any offering memoranda,
prospectuses or similar disclosure documents.

 

(b) In consideration of the agreements made by PCT in Section 3.2(a) above, in
the event MWV or any of its wholly-owned Subsidiaries (each, as applicable,
in its capacity as holder of the Note, the "Holder") enters into a Note
Financing and thereafter PCT seeks an amendment or waiver under the Note, the
Holder shall have the right in its sole discretion to agree to such amendment
or waiver; provided, however, that if (i) such amendment or waiver, as
applicable, would not reasonably be expected to have an adverse effect on
MWVs net recovery on the Note and (ii) the requisite majority of
financing sources under the agreements governing the Note Financing agree in
writing to such amendment or waiver, then the Holder shall also agree to such
amendment or waiver. If the requisite majority of financing sources providing
the Note Financing accept such amendment or waiver, as applicable, and MWV
withholds its consent, PCT shall have the right to prepay the Note in
accordance with the terms set forth in Section 4(b) thereof.

 

(c) Purchaser represents, warrants and covenants that the aggregate Farm
Credit System exposure of PCT and its Affiliates (treating undrawn borrowing
commitments as being fully drawn for purposes of this provision) is less than
or equal to $226,000,000 on the Closing Date. Without the prior written
consent of MWV (such consent to be given or withheld in MWVs sole
discretion), until the date that is one hundred thirty-five (135) days after
the Closing Date PCT, for itself and on behalf of its Affiliates, hereby
agrees that it shall not incur any indebtedness in, or obtain any commitments
for indebtedness from, the Farm Credit System (other than the Existing
Indebtedness) unless the Note shall have been financed prior to the date of
determination (it being understood and agreed that Purchaser shall be
permitted to draw down any of the Existing Borrowing Commitments during such
period).

 



24 (d) If MWV securitizes the Note in the bond market, prior to or concurrently
with such securitization, MWV shall agree to modify the covenants and events
of default contained in the Note to be consistent in all material respects
with the covenants, events of default and other applicable provisions
(excluding, for the avoidance of doubt, rate, maturity and prepayment terms)
contained in PCTs most-recently-issued bonds (and related indenture, as
supplemented or amended) and, if the interest rate on the Note then equals the
Parties Agreed Rate, MWV shall agree to modify the interest rate on the Note
to be equal to the Banker Agreed Rate (such modified interest rate to be
effective from and after the date of such modification). The Parties hereby
acknowledge and agree that (i) the foregoing modifications shall be made in
consideration of PCTs cooperation with such securitization in accordance with
Section 3.2(a) above and PC Parents agreeing to guarantee PCTs obligations
under the Note from and after the time such modifications are made and (ii)
no securitization in the bond market shall be consummated until such
modifications are in effect.

(e) To the extent MWV has not entered into a Note Financing within one
hundred thirty-five (135) days of the Closing Date, MWV shall agree to modify
the covenants and events of default contained in the Note to be consistent in
all material respects with the covenants, events of default and other
applicable provisions (excluding, for the avoidance of doubt, rate, maturity
and prepayment terms) contained in PCTs most-recently-issued bonds (and
related indenture, as supplemented or amended), and, if the interest rate on
the Note then equals the Parties Agreed Rate, MWV shall agree to modify the
interest rate on the Note to be equal to the Banker Agreed Rate effective from
and after the 136th day after the Closing Date. The Parties hereby
acknowledge and agree that (i) the foregoing modifications shall be made in
consideration of PC Parents agreeing to guarantee PCTs obligations under the
Note from and after the time such modifications are made and (ii) no Note
Financing shall be consummated after the date that is one hundred thirty-five
(135) days following the Closing Date until such modifications are in effect.

 

(f) In connection with any modification of the Note in accordance with Section
3.2(d) or Section 3.2(e), as applicable, PC Parent hereby agrees to
absolutely, unconditionally and irrevocably guarantee, as primary obligor and
not merely as surety, all obligations of PCT under the Note on terms
consistent in all material respects with its guarantee of PCTs most-
recently-issued bonds (and related indenture, as supplemented or amended).

(g) Unless the interest rate on the Note equals the Banker Agreed Rate,
neither MWV nor any of its wholly-owned Subsidiaries shall enter into any Note
Financing if in connection therewith it would receive any patronage or profit
sharing distribution from the lenders thereunder.

 

(h) Unless the interest rate on the Note is set at the Banker Agreed Rate, if
MWV or any of its wholly-owned Subsidiaries, as applicable, enters into any
Note Financing in the bank market and if patronage or profit sharing
distributions are payable on account of the loans to be assigned as provided
below, then the terms of the definitive 

 



25  documentation with respect to such financing shall prohibit the lenders
thereunder from assigning their loans or commitments thereunder to any Person
other than on terms (x) consistent in all material respects with those

consummate the relevant assignment in a manner that would not result in a
reduction in the amount of the patronage or profit sharing distributions
payable on account of the loans and commitments to be assigned) or (y) with
respect to which PCT shall otherwise have consented in writing (such consent

32 7\. _Title_.

 

(a) Subject to Section 10, CDLM LLC agree to convey or cause to be conveyed to
Timberlands III, LLC (i) good and valid fee simple title to the Land and
Improvements comprising the Timberlands (except where Sellers rights are
limited to surface rights only or are subject to reservations or restrictions
with respect to subsurface rights, and without warranty or representation of
any kind as to any wind, coal, oil and gas or minerals rights), good and valid
title to the Timber, and good and valid title to the Personal Property, in
each case free and clear of all Liens, encumbrances, assessments,
agreements, options and covenants, except for those matters set forth on
Schedule 7(a) attached hereto (the "Permitted Encumbrances") as applicable to
the Timberlands, further subject to and except, in the case of Personal
Property, any leases thereof which are identified in the Timberlands
Contracts, and (ii) the Mineral Rights. Without limiting the foregoing or any
other provision of this Agreement, nothing contained in the Deeds (including
any attached list of "Permitted Exceptions" therein) shall limit or otherwise
affect the Permitted Encumbrances, and as between Seller and Purchaser, all
Deeds shall be construed as conveying title subject to all Permitted
Encumbrances as if fully set forth therein.

 

(b) Seller, at Sellers expense, shall cause the Title Company to provide
access to Purchaser to title commitments with respect to the real property it
being understood and agreed that Seller shall have no obligation to deliver
title searches or commitments with respect to any subsurface rights or the
mineral estate, mineral interests or any riparian, water, or wind rights),
and UCC searches (each, a "UCC Search" and collectively, "UCC Searches") with
respect to the Personal Property, such title commitments (each a "Title
Commitment" and collectively, "Title Commitments") to be issued by the Title
Company, as title insurer, covering all of the Land, Improvements and Timber
comprising the Timberlands, and the JV1 Properties and JV2 Properties together
with copies of all deeds, surveys, plats, Tax maps and other documents
referred to in the legal descriptions or the exception documents included in
or referred to in such Title Commitments to the extent locatable in the public
or Sellers records ("Supporting Documentation"), which Title Commitments
shall be particularly identified on Schedule _7_ (b) to be attached hereto
upon access being provided by the Title Company. Purchaser shall have, as to
each separate Title Commitment, until the later of (i) fifteen (15) days
following the Effective Date, or (ii) forty (40) days following the date that
Purchaser is granted access to such Title Commitment on the Title Company 
hosted "ShareFile" electronic data room (the "Title Objection Period"),
to deliver to Seller written notice of any matter reflected in such Title
Commitment or UCC Search which is (w) an uninsurable or missing legal
description, (x) with respect to the Timberlands, is a matter which, as to the
tract or parcel of the Timberlands which is encumbered by such matter, would
materially impair the value of such tract or parcel of Timberlands as
commercial timberland or materially interfere with the operation and
management of such tract or parcel of Timberlands as commercial timberland
and is not a Permitted Encumbrance, (y) with respect to the JV1 Properties and
JV2 Properties, a matter which would have a material adverse effect on the
entitlement, operation, management or future value of any particular named
development community (taken as a whole) within the applicable JV1 Property or
JV2 Property and is not a Permitted Encumbrance, or (z) with respect to the

 



33  Personal Property, a matter which would have a material adverse effect on
the value of the Personal Property as a whole as currently used in connection
with the operation and management of the Timberlands (each, a "Title
Objection" and collectively, the "Title Objections"). Failure of Purchaser to
deliver Title Objections within such time period shall be deemed a waiver by
Purchaser of its right to make such Title Objections and acceptance of all
exceptions and matters set forth in the respective Title Commitment or UCC
Search. A Title Commitment or UCC Search shall be deemed to have been made
available to, and received by, Purchaser when it is posted to the online data
repository established and maintained by the Title Company for such purpose,
together with all Supporting Documentation. Notwithstanding the foregoing, and
without either partys waiving its rights to assert any Title Objections
or to object to or to attempt to resolve the same or agreeing to incur any
cost or expense, Purchaser agrees to use its reasonable efforts to raise any
objections solely with respect to legal descriptions as soon as reasonably
practicable during the Title Objection Period, and Purchaser and Seller agree
to cooperate to try to resolve such objections with the Title Company as soon
as reasonably practicable thereafter.

 

(c) Upon receipt of any Title Objection, Seller may (i) dispute the propriety
of such Title Objection in accordance with Section 35 ("Title Objection
Dispute") or (ii) elect (but shall not be obligated) to attempt to cure or
cause to be cured any such Title Objection at any time prior to the date which
is five (5) Business Days prior to the Closing (subject to post-closing cure
rights as provided herein), and Seller shall notify Purchaser in writing
whether Seller is asserting a Title Objection Dispute or elects to attempt to
cure the same by the date that is fifteen (15) Business Days after receipt of
such Title Objection (which may be reasonably extended by Seller for an
additional period of up to ten (10) days depending on the volume of Title
Objections which are received at the same time), but in any event, prior to
Closing ("Sellers Response Period"), if Seller asserts a Title Objection
Dispute, it shall reserve all of its rights to cure the subject Title
Objection at or within 90 days after the Closing. Failure of Seller to respond
in writing within Sellers Response Period shall be deemed an election by
Seller not to assert a Title Objection Dispute or cure such Title Objections.
Any Title Objection shall be deemed to be cured for purposes of this Section 7
if Seller causes the Title Company to commit to issue a title insurance
policy (each, a "Title Policy" and collectively, "Title Policies") to
Purchaser for the affected property (A) over which Title Objection the Title
Company is willing to insure (without more than nominal additional cost to
Purchaser or where Seller elects to pay such cost in excess of a nominal cost
for Purchasers account), (B) against which the Title Company is willing to
provide affirmative insurance (without more than nominal additional cost to
Purchaser or where Seller elects to pay such cost in excess of a nominal cost
for Purchasers account), (C) which will be extinguished upon the transfer of
the property or (D) without raising such Title Objection as an exception to
the title policy. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Seller shall be obligated to
cure, on or before the Closing Date, all Monetary Liens (other than those that
(x) have been incurred in connection with the JV1 Properties and are set
forth in the Exhibits and Schedules to this Agreement, or (y) are entered into
prior to Closing in accordance with the terms of this Agreement).

 



34 (d) If (i) Seller does not elect to attempt to cure a Title Objection and does
not assert a Title Objection Dispute by written notice to Purchaser within
Sellers Response Period, or (ii) Seller elects to attempt to cure a Title
Objection but does not do so at the Closing or the Title Objection Dispute is
resolved in favor of Purchaser, then Purchaser must elect by delivering
written notice to Seller within five (5) Business Days after the expiration of
(A) Sellers Response Period as to clause (i) or (B) within five (5) Business
Days prior to the Closing as to clause (ii), either (x) to waive such Title
Objection and proceed to the Closing, accepting title to those portions of the
Timberlands or to such JV1 and JV2 Properties that are subject to such uncured
Title Objection (which Title Objection shall become a Permitted Encumbrance)
without adjustment to the Purchase Price pursuant to Section 13.2 hereof or
(y) to exclude from the Timberlands only those portions of the Timberlands
that are subject to such uncured Title Objection or Title Objections (subject
to the procedures set forth in Section 13), and such Excluded Property
otherwise complies with all of the provisions of Section 13 (a "Title
Objection Carveout") and proceed pursuant to Section 13 and Section 35 (if
applicable) herein. Failure of Purchaser to deliver to Seller such written
notice within the applicable five (5) Business Day period above shall be
deemed an election of clause (x). Except for any applicable Title Objection
Carveout, and the rights herein of Purchaser with respect to Title Objections
to the JV1 Properties and JV2 Properties, Seller shall have no liability for
electing to attempt to, but failing to cure, any Title Objection.

(e) In the event any title matter to which Purchaser has a right to object,
first arises after the expiration of the Title Objection Period which was not
reflected on the Title Commitments, then the following provisions will apply:

(i) Purchaser shall notify Seller of such matter in writing within ten (10)
days of the earlier Purchasers discovery of such matter or such matter being
brought to its attention by the Title Company (each, a "New Title Objection"),
and failure by Purchaser to deliver such notice within such time period shall
be deemed a waiver of any objection right with respect to such matter, which
shall become a Permitted Encumbrance. With respect to each such New Title
Objection, the same procedures for Seller to dispute the same or elect to
attempt to cure the same shall apply as in subsections (c) and (d) above,
except each of Sellers periods in which to give notice or make an election
shall be reduced to five (5) Business Days. Thereafter, the time periods for
Purchaser to make the elections to waive the New Title Objection or to assert
a Title Objection Carveout shall each be reduced to five (5) Business Days.

 

(ii) If such New Title Objection is a Monetary Lien, Seller shall be obligated
to cure such New Title Objection on or before the Closing Date. 

(f) (i) If any Title Objection with respect to any JV1 or JV2 Properties (as
to which Seller does not assert a Title Objection Dispute or elect to cure
the same) constitutes or results in a material adverse effect with respect to
any particular named development community or project (taken as a whole)
within the applicable JV1 Property or JV2 Property, as applicable, then the
Title Objection Carveout shall consist of the entire named development
community which contains the property subject to the Title Objection, and the
parties shall proceed as provided in Section 13 and Section 35 (as
applicable).

 



35 (ii) If any Title Objection with respect to any Personal Property (as to which
Seller does not assert a Title Objection Dispute or elect to cure the same)
constitutes or results in a material adverse effect with respect to the
affected Personal Property then the Title Objection Carveout shall consist of
the particular Personal Property which is subject to the Title Objection so
long as it can reasonably be removed or severed from the remainder of the
Personal Property without material expense; provided that Seller shall have
the option to include the subject personal property within the sale to
Purchaser but subject to any applicable reduction in the Purchase Price, and
the parties shall proceed as provided in Section 13 and Section 35\.

 

(g) So long as this Agreement remains in force, Seller shall not, without the
prior written consent of Purchaser, which consent not to be unreasonably
withheld, (i) enter into any new lease, or first encumber or convey all or
part of the Assets or any interest therein (provided, however, that Purchaser
acknowledges the existence of the Timberlands Contracts and that Seller
may from time to time execute timber sale agreements, service contracts and
other similar agreements necessary to continue operations in the ordinary
course of business), or (ii) enter into any new agreement, including stumpage
sale contracts, granting to any Person any right with respect to the
Timberlands, the JV1 or JV2 Properties or Mineral Rights or any portion
thereof. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Seller shall have the right, in the
ordinary course of business without Purchasers consent (provided that Seller
shall provide updates no less often than every two (2) weeks), (1) to enter
into lease, license and concession agreements that are terminable without
cause on or before the Closing, (2) to renew the Timberlands Contracts or to
enter into new recreational leases substantially in the form of the existing
Timberlands Contracts, provided that any such renewal or new recreational
lease (A) shall be for a term of not more than twelve (12) months after the
Closing, and (B) shall be terminable by the lessor thereunder upon not less
than sixty (60) days prior notice, (3) to continue to manage, operate and
harvest the Timberlands in the ordinary course of business in accordance with
the Forecasted Harvesting Plan and in accordance with Sustainable Forest
Practice Standards, including entering into new contracts and agreements
therefor, and road maintenance, silvicultural operations and planting, (4) in
the ordinary course of business in accordance with the Forecasted Harvesting
Plan, enter into any new harvest contracts or extend any existing harvest
contracts, in each case, having a term that expires on or before February 28,
2014, (5) to comply with all terms, conditions and provisions of, and
otherwise perform, all Timberlands Contracts and Permitted Encumbrances in
existence or for which application has been made or which
Governmental Authorities have granted permission on the Effective Date,
including all terms, conditions and requirements of development agreements,
permits, entitlements and other agreements in respect of the JV1 and JV2
Properties that have been disclosed in the Exhibits and Schedules to this
Agreement, and (6) continue to manage, operate, develop, lease and sell
(consistent with Sellers Disclosures) the JV1 Properties and JV2 Properties
in the ordinary course of business and, with respect to the JV2 Properties,
in accordance with the JV2 Strategic Plans (as such term is defined in the LLC
Agreement). To avoid any doubt, prior to the Closing Date, Seller shall not
incur any debt or place any Monetary 

 



36  Lien on or with respect to MWV-EED or the JV2 Subsidiaries, or the JV2
Properties without Purchasers consent, which may be granted or denied in
Purchasers sole discretion. Purchaser acknowledges that Purchaser is aware
that after Closing, Purchaser shall have the obligation to reforest such
harvested areas pursuant to applicable laws, rules and regulations.

 

(h) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Section 7, if within
ninety (90) days after the Closing, Seller elects to undertake and completes
the curing of any Title Objection with respect to any Title Objection Carveout
and notifies Purchaser thereof in writing, Purchaser shall purchase the
Excluded Property in question from Seller (or such property shall
be contributed by Seller to MWV-EED or JV1, as applicable) for cash at a
price (or amount of capital contribution by Purchaser) equal to the value by
which the Purchase Price was reduced (or the amount by which Purchasers
capital contribution was reduced) because of the Title Objection Carveout
(and otherwise on the terms set forth in this Agreement), provided that the
Excluded Property is in substantially the same physical condition, reasonable
wear and tear excluded, as it was as of the date of Closing. Subject to the
continued satisfaction of the conditions set forth in Section 19 (with the
term "Closing Date" construed to mean the date of closing on the Excluded
Property) solely to the extent such conditions remain applicable to the
Excluded Property, the parties shall close the purchase and sale (or
contribution) of any such Excluded Property on a date that is on or about
thirty (30) days after Seller so notifies Purchaser that the cure has
been completed (or on such other date as Purchaser and Seller may agree), and
at such closing the parties shall take the actions (and bear the costs) with
respect to the purchase and sale of such Excluded Property that would have
been taken (or borne) by such party under this Agreement had the Excluded
Property been included in the original Closing, and such closing thereafter
shall be considered the "Closing" with respect to such Excluded Property for
all purposes of this Agreement.

 

(i) The Parties agree that the measurement of "acre" and "acreage" as used in
this Agreement for any and all purposes has been, and shall be, calculated in
accordance with the GIS method, absent manifest error.

8\. _Inspection_.

 

(a) _Generally_. Purchaser and its agents, representatives, employees,
engineers and contractors shall have the right during the term of this
Agreement prior to the Closing, upon reasonable advance notice to Seller and
the opportunity for Seller to have a representative present and accompany
Purchaser and its representatives, in Sellers sole discretion, to enter upon
the Assets to inspect, examine, survey and make test borings, soil bearing
tests, timber cruises, soil percolation tests and other review, engineering
tests or surveys which it may deem necessary or advisable and to verify the
accuracy of all data and information, if any, provided by Seller to Purchaser
in connection with the Assets, all to be done in a prudent and professional
manner ("Purchasers Environmental Review"); provided, however, that Purchaser
shall obtain the written consent of Seller, which shall not be unreasonably
withheld, prior to conducting any core sampling, test borings, ground water
sampling, soil sampling, surface water sampling or other invasive testing.
Purchasers request for such written consent

 



37  shall describe with reasonable specificity the Assets to be entered and the
testing to be undertaken. Seller shall have the right, in its sole discretion
and expense, to obtain split samples of any test borings, soil bearing tests,
soil percolation tests and other engineering tests, surveys or invasive
testing which is performed. Purchaser shall share the results of any such
testing, upon request from Seller. Purchaser and all
contractors, representatives and agents of Purchaser who enter upon the
Assets shall maintain (i) commercial general liability insurance, naming
Seller as an additional insured, in an amount not less than $2,000,000, (ii)
workers compensation insurance providing statutory benefits, (iii)
employers liability in an amount not less than $1,000,000 per accident,
$1,000,000 per employee by disease and $1,000,000 disease policy limit, (iv)
auto liability insurance in an amount not less than $1,000,000 combined
single limit and (v) excess umbrella liability insurance in an amount not less
than $1,000,000, in each case with respect to each separate contractor,
representative or agent, and, prior to any such entry upon the Assets,
Purchaser shall provide Seller with written evidence of such insurance, the
limits of which can be satisfied by a combination of primary and
excess/umbrella coverage. Purchaser hereby agrees to and shall indemnify and
hold Seller harmless for any and all costs, expenses, liabilities, claims,
actions, proceedings, and damages whether arising out of personal injuries or
property damage to the subject Asset or any other land or property (including
reasonable attorneys fees) resulting from or arising out of said access,
entry, inspections, examinations and tests; provided, however, that Purchaser
shall not be responsible for the discovery of pre-existing conditions on the
Assets, but shall be solely responsible for and indemnify and hold harmless
Seller against the exacerbation of any pre-existing conditions on the Assets
to the extent contributed to by the negligent or intentional act or omission
of Purchaser. The foregoing indemnification shall survive any termination,
cancellation or expiration of this Agreement or the Closing.

(b) _Environmental Review_. Subject to the provisions and limitations set
forth in Section 8(a) above, (x) with respect to the portion of the Assets
(other than the South Carolina Timberlands) covered in each Phase I Report,
Purchaser will have the right at any time on or before the later of (i)
thirty (30) days following receipt of each Phase I Report or (ii) fifteen (15)
days following the Effective Date and (y) with respect to the South Carolina
Timberlands and Specified West Virginia Timberlands, Purchaser shall have the
right at any time on or before November 22, 2013 (the "Environmental Review
Period") to review and verify the information contained in those certain Phase
I Environmental Site Assessments described on Schedule 8(b) (collectively,
the "Phase I Reports"), which Phase I Reports have been commissioned by
Seller. In the event that the Phase I Reports, Purchasers Environmental
Review or Sellers Disclosures attached hereto as Schedule 14 disclose the
existence of an environmental matter to which Purchaser objects and which (i)
would ordinarily constitute a "recognized environmental condition" under
applicable ASTM environmental practices, or (ii) indicates the presence of
any Hazardous Substance that presents a material risk of harm to public health
or the environment, or (iii) indicates the presence of any Hazardous Substance
that would be the subject of an enforcement action if brought to
the attention of the appropriate Governmental Authorities and reasonably
likely to result in material monetary liability or remediation costs to
Purchaser (hereinafter collectively referred to as an "Environmental
Condition"), Purchaser shall so notify Seller of its objections, if any, on
or before expiration of the Environmental Review Period.

 



38  Purchaser may, at its sole discretion, provide Seller a prioritized schedule
of sites where Purchaser has identified a possible or actual Environmental
Condition and further investigation is requested or required prior to
Purchaser making any decision to notify Seller of an objection regarding such
sites. Seller will reasonable cooperate with Purchaser to coordinate site
visits to such priority sites and Seller or Sellers environmental consultant
will accompany Purchaser or Purchasers environmental consultant, when
practicable. If after the Environmental Review Period but before Closing
Purchaser becomes aware of an Environmental Condition not disclosed by
the Phase I Reports, the Purchasers Environmental Review or Sellers
Disclosures, Purchaser shall so notify Seller within ten (10) days of
discovery of the undisclosed Environmental Condition. If Purchaser fails to
give such notice to Seller within the time specified, the objection(s) shall
be deemed waived by Purchaser. Seller shall have the right, but not the
obligation, to attempt to cure and remove any or all such Environmental
Conditions prior to Closing, or dispute the existence of the Environmental
Condition by notice to Purchaser ("Environmental Objection Dispute") within
fifteen (15) days after receipt of Purchasers notice of an Environmental
Condition, and submit the matter to resolution in accordance with Section
35\. If Seller is unwilling or fails to cure any such Environmental Condition
by Closing, and has not asserted any Environmental Objection Dispute Purchaser
may in its sole discretion: (x) waive its objection and proceed with Closing,
or (y) (1) with respect to any of the Assets (specifically excluding any of
the JV1 or JV2 Properties), elect to delete the portion or portions of the
property affected by such Environmental Condition from the Assets conveyed by
Seller or (2) with respect to the JV1 or JV2 Properties, if the Environmental
Condition results in a material adverse effect with respect to the entire
named development community (taken as a whole) within the applicable
JV1 Property or JV2 Property, as applicable, elect to delete the entire named
development community only ("Environmental Carveout") and proceed pursuant to
Section 13 and Section 35 herein. In the event Purchaser fails to
provide notice of any Environmental Conditions during the Environmental
Review Period, Purchaser shall be deemed to have waived objection to such
Environmental Conditions. Without limiting Purchasers other rights under this
Agreement, Purchaser agrees and confirms that, subsequent to the Closing, it
will not make any claims under any warranty in the Deeds with respect to any
Environmental Conditions or any other environmental matters disclosed in or
pursuant to this Agreement.

 

(c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Section 8, if (i) within
ninety (90) days after the Closing, Seller completes the remediation of any
Environmental Condition with respect to an Environmental Carveout in a manner
reasonably acceptable to Purchaser, and notifies Purchaser thereof in writing
and (ii) Purchaser has not previously elected to permanently exclude the
Environmental Carveout pursuant to Section 35 herein, Purchaser shall purchase
the Excluded Property in question from Seller (or such property shall be
contributed by Seller to MWV-EED or JV1, as applicable) for cash at a price
(or amount of capital contribution by Purchaser) equal to the value by which
the Purchase Price was reduced (or the amount by which Purchasers capital
contribution was reduced) because of the Environmental Carveout (and otherwise
on the terms set forth in this Agreement), provided that the Excluded
Property is in substantially the same condition, reasonable wear and tear
excluded and Environmental Condition remediated, as it was as of the date of
Closing. Subject to the continued satisfaction of the conditions set forth in
Section 19 (with the term "Closing Date"

 



39  construed to mean the date of closing on the Excluded Property) solely to
the extent such conditions remain applicable to the Excluded Property, the
parties shall close the purchase and sale (or contribution) of any such
Excluded Property on a date that is on or about thirty (30) days after Seller
so notifies Purchaser that the remediation has been completed (or on such
other date as Purchaser and Seller may agree), and at such closing the
parties shall take the actions (and bear the costs) with respect to the
purchase and sale of such Excluded Property that would have been taken (or
borne) by such party under this Agreement had the Excluded Property been
included in the original Closing, and such closing thereafter shall be
considered the "Closing" with respect to such Excluded Property for all
purposes of this Agreement.

 

(d) _Access_. Seller shall deliver to Purchaser and the Title Company at the
Closing an affidavit in the general form set forth on  _Exhibit 2_ ,
certifying to Purchaser and Title Company any Historical Access information
provided by Seller (the "Access Affidavit"), with respect to any tracts of
land as to which the Title Company has noted a lack of legal access according
to the public records. Seller and Purchaser shall work collaboratively in good
faith with the Title Company to seek insured legal or Historical Access on as
many of the acres as is practicable, with only nominal cost or expense to
Seller. 

9\. _HSR Act_. The Parties have mutually determined in good faith that filings
are not required under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of
1976, as amended, and its implementing rules and regulations (together, the
"HSR Act and Rules"), based on the current terms of the Transactions and the
current application of the HSR Act and Rules. In the event that there are
changes in the terms of the Transactions, the application of the HSR Act and
Rules or other circumstances such that filings will be required, the Purchaser
and Seller will cooperate and coordinate to submit their respective filings
and will use their respective reasonable best efforts to cause the expiration
or termination of any applicable waiting period.

 

10\. _Reserved Interests; Dominant Estate and Surface Damage Provisions_.

 

(a) At the Closing, the Deeds delivered to Timberlands III, LLC and Highland
Mineral shall reserve and except in the name of Seller, its successors and
assignees and designated licensees the Reserved Interests and all ArborGen
Nurseries, together with all easements and rights of way provided under the
Rupert Lease and the EAEC Lease (except with respect to the partial
assignment thereof to Highland Mineral as provided herein) for the continued
operation, management, use and exploitation thereof.

(b) At the Closing, Purchaser shall grant to Seller or its Affiliates, MWV-
EED and/or JV1 certain road, drainage and other easements as are more
particularly described on Schedule 10(b). At or after the Closing, Purchaser
shall, following good faith negotiations by Purchaser and Seller, grant to
Seller or its Affiliates, MWV-EED and/or JV1, as applicable, such other or
additional easements across such of the Timberlands as are adjacent to the
property which may be owned or retained by Seller or its Affiliates, or the
JV1 Properties or the JV2 Properties, as applicable, as are reasonable and
subject to commercially reasonable terms, taking into account location, width,
allowed uses, maintenance, construction, compensation and other customary
issues arising out of a proposed grant of easement rights over adjoining
property.

 



40 (c) Notwithstanding anything contained in this Agreement to the contrary, the
West Virginia Deeds and the West Virginia Mineral Rights Deeds shall provide,
as covenants running with the land, that coal is the Dominant Estate vis-a-vis
the Reserved Interests.

 

(d) "Dominant Estate" shall mean:

 

(i) The coal rights may be developed by any technology, process, practice or
means of mining, drilling or development now known or hereafter invented or
developed.

(ii) The coal owner and its coal rights lessees, in the development of the
coal rights, shall have no duty to provide subjacent and lateral support for
wells, pipelines and other surface facilities.

(iii) The coal owner and its coal rights lessees shall have drainage rights,
dumping rights for refuse and overburden and easements and rights of way for
roadways granted by the surface owner, provided there shall be no drainage,
dumping or refuse permitted in areas constructed for such purposes by the
Hydrocarbon owner or lessee ("Operator") in the development of the
Hydrocarbons or at existing drill sites, pipelines or surface facilities.

 

(iv) In the event the coal owner, acting in a commercially reasonable manner,
determines that development of the Reserved Interests (1) will directly and
adversely affect any active or planned underground coal operation within a
marketable coal reserve with a seam exceeding twenty-four inches (24") in
height in which pillars cannot be planned in coordination with the
development of the Reserved Interests, or (2) will directly and adversely
impact any active surface mining operation or a planned surface mining
operation for which a permit application has been filed, or (3) any surface
facilities associated with such underground or surface mining operation, the
coal owner shall have the following rights:

A. Within thirty (30) days of receipt of Operators notification of a
proposed well location, to prohibit drilling of such well at such location;
provided, however, that the coal owner shall provide and approve another
acceptable location for such proposed well as close in proximity as possible
to, but no more than one thousand five hundred feet (1,500) from, the
prohibited location. Upon failure of the coal owner to notify Operator that
the drilling of the well is prohibited, and providing an acceptable location
of the proposed well, within said 30-day period, Operator shall have the right
to assume that the proposed location is acceptable to the coal owner;

 



41 B. Within thirty (30) days of receipt of Operators notification of
a proposed pipeline location or other surface facilities such as compressor
stations, meters, or other surface equipment, to prohibit installation of such
pipeline or other surface facilities at such location; provided, however, that
coal owner shall provide and approve another acceptable location for such
proposed pipeline or other surface facilities as close in proximity as
possible to the prohibited location and such alternate location shall not
directly and adversely affect the Hydrocarbon operations. Upon failure of the
coal owner to provide notice to Operator that the installation of the pipeline
or other surface facility is prohibited, or failure to provide an acceptable
location of the proposed pipeline or other surface facilities within said
30-day period, Operator shall have the right to assume that the proposed
location is acceptable to coal owner.

 

C. To require Operator, at coal owners expense, to move any of its pipelines
or related surface facilities which Operator constructs or places on the
property herein conveyed to another location reasonably designated by coal
owner as close in proximity as possible to, but no more than one thousand five
hundred feet (1,500) from, the current location.

(v) The Operator shall consult with the surface owner prior to using existing
access roads owned by surface owner. The Operator shall repair any damages it
causes to roads it uses on the West Virginia Lands that it did not construct.
The surface owner, coal owner and other minerals owner shall have the right to
use roads constructed by the Operator and shall repair any damages they cause
to such roads.

(vi) The surface owner shall be entitled to damages for surface disturbance on
account of Hydrocarbon operations, based solely upon the formula, and its
sole remedy for surface damages, with the exception of damages arising out of
violation of Environmental Laws, shall be, as set forth in subsection
10(d)(vii) below.

 

(vii) The Operator shall stack all timber cut for its well locations,
pipelines, road right-of-ways and other operations at sites mutually agreed
upon by the Operator and surface owner which timber may be subsequently
removed by surface owner or its contractors and shall remain the property of
surface owner. The Operator shall pay damages for all areas disturbed by well
locations, pipelines, well roads and other operations according to one of the
two following formulas, as applicable, such payments to be made within sixty
(60) days following completion of the work:

 

A. Where timber stand is less than twenty-six (26) years old, Damages equals
[Regeneration Stand Value] + [Lost Income]; or

B. Where timber stand is twenty-six (26) years old or older, damages equals
[Lost Income] + [Actual Value of Merchantable Timber].

 



42 _Where_ :

 

"Regeneration Stand Value" shall be $15 per acre multiplied by the age of the
timber stand in years ( _Example_ : Two acres of 20 year-old timber = $15 x 2
x 20 = $600).

"Lost Income" shall be $3,000.00 per acre ( _Example:_ Two and one quarter
acres disturbed: 2.25 acres x $3,000.00/acre = $6,750.00).

"Actual Value of Merchantable Timber" shall be determined on the basis of the
board footage and species of timber cut multiplied by the price then being
paid to surface owner (or other local timber operator if surface owner is not
in the timber business) for timber of like kind and character. Actual Value of
Merchantable Timber shall not exceed Three Thousand ($3,000) Dollars per acre
(Timber Damages Cap). All values for calculating damages for cut timber and
surface use, including the Timber Damages Cap, shall be adjusted on February
1, 2024, and every ten years thereafter, to reflect the cumulative annual
change up or down in the Producers Price Index for Hardwood Lumber (08-12) as
published by the U.S. Department of Labor, Bureau of Labor Statistics for each
January to January annual period during the ten years prior; _provided_ ,
_that_ , in no event shall any such ten year adjustment increase or decrease
exceed twenty-four (24%) percent. In the event that the Producers Price Index
for Hardwood Lumber is discontinued, all subsequent adjustments shall be made
on the nearest comparable commodity price index that is then available as
mutually agreed to by the Operator and surface owner.

 

(viii) Where coal is required by law to be left for protection of a well or
wells and/or a coal mine or mines in coal seams in the lands included herein,
the Operator shall pay to the coal owner a coal royalty of One Dollar ($1.00)
per net ton or five percent (5%) of the average gross selling price of similar
quality coal sold in the area, whichever is greater, for the
estimated quantity of mineable and merchantable coal required by law to be
left as a pillar for the protection of any such well, royalty to be paid at
the time said pillar coal is located and by-passed by the coal mining
operations; provided however, that, if any well is abandoned prior to the
time that coal mining operations reach such well and the well is so plugged as
to allow the mining recovery of said pillar of coal in compliance with the
applicable laws and regulations of the United States Government and the State
of West Virginia, then Seller shall not be obligated to pay the coal royalty
herein provided on account of the drilling of such well. For the purpose of
this Section, the seams of coal which shall be considered as "mineable" shall
be those seams which are twenty-four inches (24") or more in thickness.

(e) Section 10(d) shall not be interpreted to provide any rights or
obligations other than those specifically set forth therein.

(f) Seller shall make any future Hydrocarbon lease subject to payment of
damages to the surface owner according to the foregoing formula, and damages
measured by that formula shall constitute all damages to which the surface
owner shall be entitled for surface 

 



43  damages on account of Hydrocarbon operations, it being understood and agreed
that the surface owner requested the foregoing formula and accepts the same
for itself, its successors and assigns as full compensation for such surface
damages for reasonable surface use, in lieu of and in full satisfaction of any
statutory or common law entitlement to damages.

 

(g) Notwithstanding anything contained in this Agreement to the contrary, the
Parties agree that, in lieu of the rights set forth in Sections 10(d) through
(f), they shall be governed by the provisions of this Section 10(g) during (1)
the term of the Rupert Lease and (2) with respect to the West Virginia Lands
then covered by the Rupert Lease (except to the extent any lands thereunder
are also subject at that time to the EAEC Lease). The provisions of Sections
10(d) through10(f) shall apply to any part or portion of the West Virginia
Lands only when the Rupert Lease no longer applies to such lands by virtue of
lease termination; surrender of acreage; pursuant to the provisions of this
section for failure to assign; or for any other reason. The Parties agree that
the provisions of this Section 10(g) shall not be included in the West
Virginia Deeds and West Virginia Mineral Deeds, but that this Section 10(g)
shall continue in full force and effect for the time specified and with
respect to the lands covered and shall not be deemed terminated by the
doctrine of merger or otherwise by virtue of its absence from the West
Virginia Deeds or the West Virginia Mineral Deeds. PCT and Highland shall make
any subsequent conveyance of the West Virginia Lands then covered by the
Rupert Lease subject to the terms of this Section 10(g). If PCT or Highland
does not make any subsequent conveyance subject hereto, the West Virginia
Lands or portion thereof so conveyed shall be subject only to the provisions
regarding Dominant Estate set forth in the West Virginia Deeds and the West
Virginia Mineral Deeds.

(i) Seller shall reserve and continue to exercise all rights and privileges of
the Lessor under the Rupert Lease, provided, however, that Seller shall
permit Highland Mineral (1) to direct Sellers actions with respect to rights
of both the surface owner and the coal owner under Sections 1(C) (3)  (7), 6,
7 and 8 of the Rupert Lease, as modified and clarified in subsections
10(g)(viii)(A)  (D) below (the "Rupert Provisions") and (2) Highland Mineral
shall comply with all obligations of both the surface owner and the coal owner
under the Rupert Lease, as modified and clarified in the Rupert Provisions.
PCT hereby appoints Highland as its irrevocable agent and attorney-in-fact to
exercise such rights and waives any claim for Losses it may accrue
attributable to Sellers reliance on Highlands directions, acts or omissions
as such agent.

(ii) If the lessee or lessees under the Rupert Lease ("Rupert Lessee")
breaches any of the Rupert Provisions and Rupert Lessee or its insurers do not
pay PCTs or Highland Minerals, as applicable, Losses for Rupert Lessees
breach of those provisions, Seller shall pay such Losses (or amounts not paid
by Lessee or its insurers) to PCT or Highland Mineral, as their interests
appear, and Seller shall have full rights of subrogation with respect to any
amounts paid to PCT or Highland Mineral. Seller shall have no responsibility
for tortious acts or omissions of Lessee and shall have no responsibility for
punitive damages, and Purchaser hereby waives any claim for punitive damages
against Seller under any theory of tort, breach of contract, or otherwise
arising out of the acts or omissions of its Lessee provided that PCT or
Highland Mineral shall retain the rights to pursue such damages directly from
Lessee.

 



44 (iii) Seller shall enforce the Rupert Provisions at the written request of
Highland Mineral and at Highland Minerals expense, provided that, subject to
the remaining provisions of this subsection, Highland Mineral shall have full
control of any such legal actions and reserves at all times the right to
choose the attorney or attorneys to perform the professional services
involved in such actions. Seller shall in no event seek any relief from Rupert
Lessee on behalf of Highland other than monetary damages, specific
performance, injunctive relief, a declaratory judgment action, or
any combination thereof, but such relief shall not interfere with continuing
operations in accordance with the terms of the Rupert Lease. In no event may
Highland or PCT seek to terminate or cancel the Rupert Lease or in any manner
seek to obtain any relief that would interfere with continuing operations
under the Rupert Lease or any portion thereof. Seller shall retain all rights
under the Rupert Lease as the owner of the Hydrocarbons, and neither PCT nor
Highland shall be entitled to diminish any of the rights or obligations of
Seller or Rupert Lessee under the Rupert Lease.

(iv) Highland Mineral shall promptly respond to all requests for consent by
Rupert Lessee and shall not unreasonably withhold any response. Both Seller
and Highland Mineral shall have the duty to act in good faith and fair dealing
in exercising their rights and obligations. If Highland breaches any of the
obligations of the surface owner or coal owner with which it has agreed to
comply under subsection (i) above, Seller may pursue any remedies it may have
for such breach. In the event the Rupert Lessee makes a claim or files a
civil action claiming that Seller breached its obligations under the Rupert
Lease based upon direction provided by Highland Mineral, Highland Mineral
shall indemnify and defend Seller against all Losses arising from such claim.

 

(v) PCT hereby guarantees payment of Highland Minerals financial obligations
under the Rupert Provisions and under subsections 10(g)(iii) and (iv).

(vi) In the event there is litigation or a binding alternate dispute
resolution proceeding between Seller and Rupert Lessee relating to an alleged
breach of the Rupert Provisions, PCT and Highland Mineral shall be bound by
the outcome of that litigation or alternate dispute resolution proceeding,
provided, that PCT or Highland Mineral, as applicable, may, at its own cost
and expense, seek to intervene in the litigation or alternate dispute
resolution proceeding to protect its rights and Seller will not oppose such
intervention. PCT or Highland Mineral shall provide full cooperation and
support in any litigation Seller might institute to recover amounts paid for
breach of the Rupert Provisions. If PCT or Highland Mineral settles a claim
for Losses directly with the Rupert Lessee or its insurers, it may not seek
further compensation from Seller. 

(vii) Notwithstanding the foregoing, only PCT shall have the right to surface
damages and PCT shall, with the exception of damages arising out of the
violation of Environmental Laws, be bound by the formula for such damages as
established in Section 6.B.2.

 



45 (viii) The Rupert Provisions are clarified and modified only for purposes of
implementing this subsection 10(g) between the Parties hereto as follows, but
shall have no effect on the rights of the Lessee:

A. The provisions of Sections 6.C.1, 6.D.2 and 8.B.2 are hereby modified to
provide that Seller shall provide notice to Highland Mineral within five (5)
days of receipt of any requests or notices from Rupert Lessee regarding
location of surface facilities, use of roads and well location proposals
received from Rupert Lessee. Highland Mineral shall respond to Seller at least
five (5) days prior to the date on which any response is due to Lessee.

 

B. The provisions of Sections 8.A., 8.A.1, 8.A.2, 8.A.3, 8A.4 and 8A.6 shall
be disregarded. The language in Section 8.A.5 shall be modified and
interpreted to provide that Operator shall cooperate with coal lessees to
reduce, to the maximum extent practicable, the unmined coal barrier that must
be left around Operators well bores. Operator shall provide, at no cost, as-
drilled surveys of well bores for depths beginning one hundred feet (100)
above the shallowest coal formation and ending one hundred feet (100) below
the deepest coal formation. Operator also shall not unreasonably withhold any
consent required or needed by a coal lessee for any governmental agency with
respect to minimizing the unmined coal barrier. Operator shall not be required
to waive any causes of action it may have against a coal lessee for damages
to a well on account of such cooperation.

C. The language in Section 8.B.1 that "All wells shall be located so as not
to interfere with the Coal Estate leases" shall be disregarded as an ambiguous
reference to the specific rights set forth in the Lease.

 

D. The provisions of Section 8.B.1 regarding the Coal Operations Acreage Map
shall be modified and interpreted to provide that Highland Mineral shall from
time to time, but no later than February 1, 2018, and thereafter on each fifth
(5th) anniversary of that date (but in no event more frequently than
once during any twelve (12) month period), provide Seller and Lessee a map
depicting the boundaries of tracts (as defined by Highland Mineral) designated
as Coal Operations Acreage, provided, that the Coal Operations Acreage
designated on any such map shall never exceed one-tenth (1/10) of the Leased
Premises acreage excluding Earned Acreage (as defined in the Rupert Lease) and
surrendered acreage. Seller shall provide Highland Mineral with a report of
Earned Acreage and surrendered acreage upon request. Highland Mineral shall
cooperate in good faith to remove acreage from the map where tracts have
already been mined or it has no plans to mine in the future. If Highland
Mineral fails to provide an updated Coal Operations Acreage Map, Seller and
its Lessee shall have no obligation to avoid drilling in a particular area
except as provided in Section 8.B.2. The remainder of Section 8.B.1 are not
modified by the subsection.

 



46 11\. _Deliveries; No Contact_. Purchaser acknowledges that Seller has
delivered to Purchaser, and Purchaser is in receipt of, (i) Sellers current
compartment maps for each tract within the Timberlands and JV2 Property (which
maps shall include aerial imagery, topographical imagery and timber type),
(ii) copies of the Material Timberlands Contracts, Material JV1 Contracts,
and Material JV2 Contracts (it being understood that Seller shall deliver to
Purchaser copies of all Timberlands Contracts at least twenty (20) days prior
to the Closing Date), (iii) copies of the Limestone Lease, (iv) partially
redacted copies of the Rupert Lease, the EAEC Lease and the West Virginia
Paving Lease, and (v) copies of other material items related to the ownership,
development and management of the Assets and those requested by Purchaser, to
the extent the same are in Sellers possession or control and are reasonably
available to Seller. Prior to the Closing, Purchaser shall not contact or
communicate with any counterparty to any Timberlands Contract, Material JV1
Contract, Material JV2 Contract, the Limestone Lease, the Rupert Lease, the
EAEC Lease, the West Virginia Paving Lease or joint venture agreement with
respect to the Transactions without the prior written consent of Seller as to
each prospective contact, which shall not be unreasonably withheld. Seller
hereby consents to Purchaser, in cooperation with Seller if Seller desires to
participate, contacting logging contractors after the Effective Date for
the purpose of introducing Purchaser as a potential buyer of the Timberlands
and as a potential assignee of the logging contracts. If this Agreement is
terminated or if Closing does not occur, Purchaser shall promptly return to
Seller all information delivered to Purchaser (in whatever form) pursuant to
this Agreement, provided that, to the extent such information is in electronic
format, Purchaser shall delete or destroy all such information, except as may
be required to comply with applicable laws and regulations or a pre-existing
formal document retention policy, and promptly deliver to Seller written
certification of such destruction. Purchaser shall also hold as confidential
and not disclose any information learned from the Phase I Reports, the
Purchaser Environmental Review, or Sellers Disclosures.

12\. _Condition of Timberlands; Damage; Condemnation_.

(a) Subject to the ongoing harvesting operations described in Section 12(b)
below, usual and customary timberland operations, natural wear and tear, the
Permitted Encumbrances, condemnation, casualty, weather and other
circumstances beyond Sellers control, Seller represents that at the Closing,
the Timberlands shall be in substantially the same condition as exists on the
Effective Date. Additionally, other than as described in Section 12(b) below,
between the Effective Date and Closing, Seller shall not harvest or remove any
timber from the Timberlands. Subject to the provisions of this Section 12,
all risk of loss to the Timberlands or any part thereof prior to the Closing
shall be borne by Seller.

(b) Purchaser acknowledges and agrees that Seller is conducting ongoing
timber harvesting operations pursuant to the Forecasted Harvesting Plan,
subject to variations as a result of weather or necessary substitutions so
long as volume levels are consistent with the Forecasted Harvesting Plan.
Seller shall use its reasonable best efforts to

 



47  assign any Forecasted Harvesting Plan contracts that are not completed by
the Closing to Purchaser. Further, Purchaser acknowledges that Purchaser is
aware that after Closing, Purchaser shall have obligation to reforest such
harvested areas pursuant to applicable laws, rules and regulations.

(c) If at any time prior to the Closing, any material portion of the Assets
(including any timber thereon) is destroyed or damaged by fire, earthquake,
flood, or other casualty, Seller shall deliver to Purchaser prompt written
notice of such damage along with the amount of such damage (calculated as the
value of the destroyed or damaged Assets plus any costs of restoration and
replanting less the salvage value of such destroyed or damaged Assets) (the
"Casualty Damage Value"). If Purchaser, by delivering written notice to
Seller within ten (10) days following Sellers delivery of written notice of
the damage, disputes the Casualty Damage Value reported by Seller, Purchaser
and Seller shall attempt in good faith to resolve such dispute and agree upon
the Casualty Damage Value. If Purchaser and Seller are unable to agree as to
the Casualty Damage Value on or before ten (10) days after Purchaser delivers
to Seller written notice of its dispute, then such dispute shall be resolved
in accordance with Section 35\. Any amounts in dispute shall be excluded from
the Purchase Price upon the Closing and shall be distributed immediately upon
resolution of any dispute in accordance with Section 35\. Upon determination
of the Casualty Damage Value the Parties shall proceed pursuant to Section
13\.

(d) If at any time prior to the Closing, any action or proceeding is filed or
threatened under which any portion of the Assets may be taken pursuant to any
law, ordinance or regulation by condemnation or the right of eminent domain,
Seller shall deliver to Purchaser prompt written notice thereof. In such
event, Purchaser and Seller shall be required to consummate the Transactions
and Purchaser shall receive a credit against the Purchase Price (or in the
case of the JV1 and JV2 Properties, the agreed aggregate valuation of the JV1
Properties and JV2 Properties described in Section 4 hereof and PCL JV1
Contribution or PCL JV2 Contribution, as applicable, shall be adjusted) in the
amount of all proceeds of any awards payable with respect to the applicable
Assets. If the amount of such awards is not known or paid at the Closing,
Purchaser will promptly pay over to Seller (or increase the applicable PCL JV1
or PCL JV2 Contribution) the amount of the award after the Closing.

 

13\. _Carveouts; Purchase Price Adjustments_.

 

13.1

(a) If Seller has asserted a Title Objection Dispute or an Environmental
Objection Dispute, such Disputes shall be reasonably aggregated in order to
efficiently resolve the Dispute(s) pursuant to Section 35\.

 



48 (b) Subject to Sellers post-closing cure rights as provided herein, (i) upon
the resolution of all Disputes referred to Section 13.1(a) (if there are any
Disputes which are resolved in the favor of Purchaser), or (ii) if there are
no such Disputes and Purchaser is entitled to and elects to exclude any
portion of the Assets pursuant to a Title Objection Carveout (Sections 7(d)
and 7(e)) or an Environmental Carveout (Section 8(b)), each of the same being
referred to as a "Carveout")), the Parties shall proceed as follows:

 

(i) With respect to all Assets other than the JV1 Properties, the JV2
Properties or the Personal Property, the Parties shall determine
the boundaries of the Carveout so that each Carveout shall be an economically
feasible and marketable parcel of commercially sufficient size and
configuration, comprising not less than 40 contiguous acres (or such lesser
number of acres as Seller may determine in its sole discretion), and which is
legally divisible or separable from the remaining parcel or tract of which it
is a part under all applicable subdivision and other laws, and (A) has access
to a public road or (B) will be granted access by recordable easement or
right of way from Purchaser at the Closing, in each case reasonably acceptable
to Seller, in accordance with the Carveout Access Easement as provided in
Section 13.1(c) below. With respect to the JV1 Properties and JV2 Properties,
the Carveout shall consist of the entire named development community or
project which contains the parcel or tract of land affected by the
Environmental Condition or Title Objection. With respect to the
Personal Property, the Carveout shall consist of the specific property
affected by the Title Objection.

(ii) The Parties shall determine the value of each Carveout, which shall (A)
for Assets (other than the JV1 and JV2 Properties and the Personal Property),
be equal to the product of the number of acres contained within such Carveout
multiplied by the per acre value of excluded property as shown on the value
table attached hereto as _Exhibit 41_ (the "Value Table") (provided that any
disputes regarding the value of any Carveout shall be resolved in accordance
with Section 35), and (B) for the JV1 and JV2 Properties, be equal to the
valuations for the same set forth in the LLC Agreement ("JV Valuation
Schedule"), and (C) for the Personal Property, shall be $0.

 

(c) At Closing, each Party shall reserve or grant, or assign or license, to
the other, its successors and assigns as appropriate, such non-exclusive
easements, rights of way, licenses and other rights for pedestrian, vehicular
and commercial access, ingress, egress and utilities as may be required by the
requesting party to access or cross any excluded portion of the
Assets (including assignment or license of rights granted pursuant to
existing access rights) upon such terms and conditions and in such form as are
reasonably agreeable to the parties that are usual and customary in timberland
transactions, but without any cost or charge therefor (other than for an
equitable allocation of expenses for repair or maintenance in connection with
such use) (as to each such Carveout, "Carveout Access Easement"). Without
limiting the foregoing, each Carveout Access Easement with respect to an
Environmental Condition (including Environmental Carveouts which are excluded
from the purchase pursuant to the last sentence of Section 35) shall contain
such reasonable rights of access, transportation, inspection, testing,
monitoring and remediation in connection with such Environmental Carveout as
are usual and customary with respect to such parcels. The Parties shall grant
or reserve, or assign or 

 



49  license, as the case may be, all of the same easements, rights of way,
licenses and other rights (including for environmental purposes) as are
applicable to Carveouts determined prior to the Closing, with respect to all
Carveouts determined after the Closing, and all of the same shall be included
within the term "Carveout Access Easements."

 

13.2

(a) Subject to Purchasers termination rights under Section 20 herein, in the
event the aggregate value of the Carveouts (Section 13.1(b)(ii)(A) and
13.1(b)(ii)(C)), including Carveouts resulting from the resolution of any
Environmental Objection Dispute in accordance with Section 35 in favor of
Purchaser) and the Casualty Damage Value (Section 12(c)) for Assets other than
the JV1 Properties and JV2 Properties exceeds Five Million Dollars
($5,000,000), the Purchase Price shall be reduced by such aggregate value and
the Purchase Price reduction under this Section 13.2 shall be applied against
the consideration paid for the affected Asset; provided that, with respect to
the South Carolina Timberlands, the Five Million Dollar ($5,000,000)
threshold shall not apply to the South Carolina Timberlands until the
aggregate number of acres of South Carolina Timberlands excluded pursuant to
an Environmental Carveout exceeds one thousand (1,000) acres. For the
avoidance of doubt, the Parties acknowledge and agree that there shall be no
adjustment to the Purchase Price in the event that an Asset is excluded from
the Assets being purchased in accordance with the last sentence of Section
35\. Any Carveout for the Assets shall not be conveyed to Purchaser (or MWV-
EED or JV1, as applicable) and shall be retained by Seller. Any Carveout for
the JV1 Properties or the JV2 Properties shall result in (a) the corresponding
JV1 Subsidiary or JV2 Subsidiary not being contributed pursuant to this
Agreement (or the corresponding JV2 East Edisto Dorchester Property being
transferred out of MWV-EED) and (b) a reduction in the PCL JV1 Contribution or
PCL JV2 Contribution, as applicable, in an amount equal to the value of such
excluded JV1 Property or JV2 Property as set forth in the JV Valuation
Schedule. For the avoidance of doubt, no Carveouts shall be considered in
determining any Losses pursuant to Section 15\.

 

(b) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, on or before November 22,
2013, Purchaser shall have the right in its sole discretion to exclude from
the Timberlands all of the Timberlands described on _Exhibit 42_ ("Specified
West Virginia Timberlands") as a result of Purchaser determining that there
are or may be any environmental problems related to the Specified West
Virginia Timberlands; it being understood that Seller shall not have the right
to object to any such exclusion pursuant to Section 8(b) or otherwise. Upon
such exclusion, the Purchase Price for the Timberlands shall be reduced by
the aggregate value of the excluded Specific West Virginia Timberlands
(calculated in accordance with Section 13.1(b)(ii)(A)); it being understood
that the Five Million Dollar ($5,000,000) threshold set forth in Section
13.2(a) shall not be applicable. Each Party shall comply with the provisions
of Section 13.1(c) with respect to any excluded Specified West Virginia
Timberlands.

 



50 13.3 _Post-Closing Payment_. Within ten (10) Business Days of the Closing,
Seller shall pay PCT an aggregate amount (the "Post-Closing Payment Amount")
of cash equal to (a) the sum of (i) Two Million Dollars ($2,000,000.00) plus
(ii) the product of (x) Seventy-five Thousand Dollars ($75,000) and (y) the
number of Business Days from December 2, 2013 (exclusive) to the Closing Date
(inclusive), less (b) an amount equal to (i) One Million Dollars
($1,000,000.00) if on the Closing Date the interest rate on the Note is set
at the Parties Agreed Rate or (ii) Two Million Five Hundred Thousand Dollars
($2,500,000.00) if on the Closing Date the interest rate on the Note is set at
the Banker Agreed Rate; provided that if the Post-Closing Payment Amount is a
negative amount, PCT shall pay Seller an amount of cash equal to the absolute
value of the Post-Closing Payment Amount. By way of example and not
limitation, if the Closing Date is December 6, 2013 and the interest rate on
the Note is set at the Parties Agreed Rate, the amount of the payment
pursuant to this Section 13.3 shall be One Million Three Hundred Thousand
Dollars ($1,300,000) ($2,000,000.00 + ($75,000.00 x 4) - $1,000,000.00).

 

13.4 _Land Sales Adjustment_. _Exhibit 43_ attached hereto lists all land
sales from the Timberlands (including the applicable number of acres in each
"Forest") that have occurred or will occur between the date hereof and the
Closing Date (such acres of Timberlands, the "Divested Timberlands"). The
Purchase Price will be reduced at Closing by an amount equal to the acreage
of the Divested Timberlands multiplied by the per acre value set forth on the
Value Table for the applicable forest management unit or "Forest" in which the
Divested Timberlands are located. Seller shall make no other land sales
except for the Divested Timberlands.

14\. _Warranties, Representations, and Disclaimers_.

the consummation of Transactions by Highland Mineral have been duly and
validly authorized by all necessary limited liability company action, and no
other company proceedings on its part is necessary for it to authorize this
Agreement or to consummate the Transactions. The execution, delivery, and
performance by Highland Mineral will not result in a breach or violation of,
or default under, the terms, conditions or provisions of its certificate of
limited liability company, limited liability agreement or any standing
resolution of its members or any other limited liability company document.

(ix) The Guaranty has been duly and validly authorized by all necessary
corporate action, and no other company proceedings on its part is necessary.
The Guaranty will not result in a breach or violation of, or default under,
the terms, conditions or provisions of its articles of incorporation, bylaws,
or any standing resolution of its shareholders (as the case may be) or any
other corporate document or material contract to which it is party.

 

(x) This Agreement has been duly and validly executed and delivered by PCT,
PCL, Marketing, Highland Mineral and PC Parent, and, assuming due
authorization, execution and delivery by Seller, is a legal, valid and binding
obligation of PCT, PCL, Marketing, Highland Mineral and PC Parent, enforceable
against them in accordance with its terms, subject to the General
Equity Principles.

(xi) Subject to section 19(a)(i), there are no approvals, consents or
registration requirements with respect to any Governmental Authority that are
or will be necessary for the valid execution and delivery by PCT, PCL,
Marketing or Highland Mineral of this Agreement, or the consummation of the
Transactions, other than those which (A) have been obtained, or (B) are of a
routine nature and not customarily obtained or made prior to execution of
purchase and sale agreements in transactions similar in nature and size to
those contemplated hereby and where the failure to obtain the same would not,
individually or in the aggregate, have a Material Adverse Effect on their
ability to perform its obligations under this Agreement.

 

(xii) There is no pending or, to their knowledge, threatened action or
proceeding before any court, governmental agency or arbitrator which may
materially adversely affect their ability to perform this Agreement.

(xiii) For purposes of Section 3(14) of ERISA, none of PCT, PCL, Marketing,
Highland Mineral and PC Parent is a party in interest with Seller. PCT is not
acquiring the Timberlands with the assets of an employee benefit plan as
defined in Section 3(3) of ERISA, and PCT is not aware of any facts or
circumstances that would cause the Transactions to be a "prohibited
transaction" within the meaning of ERISA.

 



59 (xiv) PCT, PCL, Marketing, Highland Mineral and PC Parent (which for
this purpose includes their partners, members, principal stockholders and any
other constituent entities) (y) have not been designated as a "specifically
designated national and blocked persons" on the most current list published by
the U.S. Treasury Department Office of Foreign Assets Control at its official
website, < _http://www.treas.gov/ofac/t11sdn.pdf_ > or at any replacement
website or other replacement official publication of such list and (z) are
currently in compliance with and will at all times during the term of this
Agreement remain in compliance with the regulations of the Office of Foreign
Asset Control of the Department of the Treasury and any statute, executive
order (including the September 23, 2001, Executive Order 13224 Blocking
Property and Prohibiting Transactions with Persons Who Commit, Threaten to
Commit, or Support Terrorism), or other governmental action relating thereto.

 

(xv) Purchaser will have on the Closing Date sufficient funds available to pay
the PCL JV1 Contribution, the PCL JV2 Contribution and the fees, expenses and
other payment obligations that are the responsibility of Purchaser under the
terms of this Agreement. Purchaser does not know of any circumstance or
condition as of the date of this Agreement that would reasonably be expected
to prevent or materially delay the availability of such funds at the Closing.

(c) PURCHASER ACKNOWLEDGES THAT, EXCEPT FOR THE REPRESENTATIONS AND
WARRANTIES SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT OR IN THE DOCUMENTS TO BE DELIVERED AT
THE CLOSING: (i) NO REPRESENTATIONS, WARRANTIES OR PROMISES, EXPRESS OR
IMPLIED, HAVE BEEN OR ARE BEING MADE BY OR ON BEHALF OF SELLER OR ANY OTHER

OR MINERAL RIGHTS OR INTERESTS OR RESERVATIONS THEREOF (AS TO WHICH NO
WARRANTIES AS TO TITLE ARE MADE), MERCHANTABILITY, SUITABILITY OR FITNESS FOR
A PARTICULAR PURPOSE; AND SELLER HEREBY EXPRESSLY DISCLAIMS ALL WARRANTIES,
EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, RELATING TO ANY OF THE FOREGOING MATTERS, AND (ii)
IN ENTERING INTO THIS AGREEMENT, PURCHASER HAS NOT RELIED AND DOES NOT RELY
ON ANY SUCH REPRESENTATION, WARRANTY OR PROMISE, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, BY OR ON
BEHALF OF SELLER OR ANY OTHER PERSON. PURCHASER ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES THAT,
EXCEPT AS OTHERWISE EXPRESSLY PROVIDED IN THIS AGREEMENT OR IN THE DOCUMENTS
TO BE DELIVERED AT THE CLOSING, INCLUDING SELLERS OBLIGATION TO INDEMNIFY
PURCHASER AS DESCRIBED IN SECTION 15 HEREIN, PURCHASER SHALL TAKE THE ASSETS
IN AN "AS IS, WHERE IS, AND WITH ALL FAULTS" CONDITION ON THE CLOSING DATE.

 



60 (d) UPON THE CLOSING, PURCHASER SHALL ASSUME THE RISK THAT ADVERSE MATTERS,
INCLUDING ADVERSE ENVIRONMENTAL CONDITIONS, MAY NOT HAVE BEEN REVEALED BY
SELLERS OR PURCHASERS INVESTIGATION, OR PURSUANT TO THE PHASE I REPORTS, AND
UPON THE CLOSING, EXCEPT WITH RESPECT TO A BREACH OF ANY OF SELLERS EXPRESS
REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES CONTAINED HEREIN, PURCHASER SHALL BE DEEMED TO
HAVE WAIVED, RELINQUISHED AND RELEASED SELLER FROM AND AGAINST ANY AND ALL
CLAIMS, DEMANDS, CAUSES OF ACTION (INCLUDING CAUSES OF ACTION IN TORT),
LOSSES, DAMAGES, LIABILITIES, COSTS AND EXPENSES (INCLUDING ATTORNEYS FEES
AND COURT COSTS) OF ANY AND EVERY KIND OR CHARACTER, NOW OR HEREAFTER
EXISTING, KNOWN OR UNKNOWN, WHICH PURCHASER MIGHT HAVE ASSERTED OR ALLEGED OR
MIGHT IN THE FUTURE ALLEGE AGAINST SELLER AT ANY TIME BY REASON OF OR ARISING

EVENTS, CIRCUMSTANCES OR MATTERS REGARDING THE ASSETS.

 

15\. _Indemnification._

 

(a) (i) All representations and warranties made by any party in this Agreement
shall survive for eighteen (18) months after the Closing Date, subject to the
further provisions hereof. All covenants and agreements made by any party in
this Agreement shall survive until performed in full or the obligation to so
perform shall have expired. No claim may be asserted nor may any action
be commenced against any Indemnifying Party for any inaccuracy of any
representation or warranty contained herein, unless a Claim Notice is received
by such Indemnifying Party prior to the date on which the representation or
warranty on which such claim or action is based ceases to survive as set
forth in this Section 15; provided, that any claim made by the Indemnifying
Party in accordance with this Section 15 seeking to be indemnified within the
time periods set forth in this Section 15 shall survive until such claim is
finally and fully resolved.

 (ii) Notwithstanding the foregoing, except as set forth in the Deeds, the owners affidavit or the Access Affidavit or any other document delivered at Closing, all representations and warranties made by Seller or any Affiliates with respect to the ownership, title, or access of the Assets shall terminate as of the Closing Date with respect to all such Assets as to which Purchaser has received (A) a Title Commitment for a Title Policy that meets the conditions set forth in this Agreement, the issuance of which Title Policy is subject only to Purchasers payment of the premium therefor and Purchasers satisfaction of the Title Companys other customary conditions to be satisfied by Purchaser, as to which Title Commitment Purchaser has not raised a Title Objection (or has raised a Title Objection which 

 



61  has not been upheld pursuant to Section 35 or has been cured) or (B) a
credit against the Purchase Price or a credit against the PCL JV1 Contribution
or the PCL JV2 Contribution, as the case may be. Notwithstanding any other
provision of this Section 15, with respect to any Loss in respect of any Asset
which is or may be the subject of any Title Policy, the Indemnified Party
shall first diligently pursue to resolution all rights and remedies
thereunder (including applicable law) before it shall be entitled to obtain
seek indemnity for such Loss under this Agreement or any Deed (which for the
purposes of this Section 15 only shall include all deeds with respect to
conveyances to Timberlands III, LLC, MWV-EED and JV1, and all other prior
deeds in the chain of title with respect to any subject property executed by
Seller or any Affiliate). In the event resolution has not, despite such
diligent pursuit, been obtained at least three (3) months prior to expiration
of the applicable Statute of Limitations the non-Indemnified Party shall enter
into a standstill agreement in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to
the Indemnified Party. All payments under any Title Policy with respect to
such Loss shall reduce the amount of such Loss from the first dollar.

(b) _Obligation of Seller_. If the Closing occurs, Seller shall indemnify,
defend and hold the Purchaser and their directors, officers, employees,
Affiliates, agents and representatives and their successors and assigns
(collectively, the "Purchaser Indemnitees") harmless for any Loss incurred or
suffered by any of them to the extent as a result of or in connection with or
involving a:

 

(i) breach of a representation or warranty by the Seller in this Agreement,
either (1) as made as of the date hereof or (2) if the Closing occurs, as
hereby expressly re-made as of the Closing, including any "Closing" for an
Excluded Asset, but in such event, solely with respect to, and only to the
extent such representation or warranty is applicable to such Excluded Asset,
(or, in the case of those representations and warranties that are made as of a
particular date or period, as of such date or period); or

 

(ii) breach or nonperformance of any of the covenants or agreements of Seller
contained in this Agreement.

 

(c) _Obligation of Purchaser_. If the Closing occurs, Purchaser shall
indemnify, defend and hold the Seller and their directors, officers,
employees, Affiliates, agents and representatives and their successors and
assigns (collectively, the "Seller Indemnitees") harmless for any Loss
incurred or suffered by any of them to the extent as a result of or in
connection with or involving a:

(i) breach of a representation or warranty by the Purchaser in this Agreement
either (1) as made as of the date hereof or (2) if the Closing occurs, as
hereby expressly re-made as of the Closing, including any "Closing" for an
Excluded Asset, but in such event solely with respect to, and only to the
extent such representation or warranty is applicable to such Excluded Asset,
(or, in the case of those representations and warranties that are made as of a
particular date or period, as of such date or period);

 



62 (ii) breach or nonperformance of any of the covenants or agreements of
Purchaser contained in this Agreement; or

(iii) breach or nonperformance of any of Purchasers or Timberlands III, LLCs
obligations under the Timberlands Contracts, the Mineral Leases, the Kapstone
FSA and the Inbound Kapstone-Supporting FSAs after the Closing, except to the
extent Sellers acts or omissions caused such breach or nonperformance.

 

(d) _Notice of Loss; Third Party Claims_.

 

(i) If (A) any third party institutes or asserts any proceeding that may give
rise to Losses for which an Indemnifying Party may be liable for
indemnification under this Section 15 (a "Third Party Claim") or (B) any
Indemnified Party shall have a claim to be indemnified by an Indemnifying
Party that does not involve a Third Party Claim (a "Direct Claim" and,
together with a Third Party Claim, a "Claim"), then, in each case, the
Indemnified Parties shall promptly, and in any event (x) within thirty (30)
days after becoming aware of such Claim and (y) at all times within the
survival period provided in Section 15(a), send the Indemnifying Parties a
written notice specifying in reasonable detail the nature of such Claim, the
facts and circumstances on which the asserted Claim is based, and a good
faith estimate of the related actual or potential Losses (a "Claim Notice");
provided, however, that, subject to the last sentence of 15(a), the failure to
notify or delay in notifying an Indemnifying Party will not relieve the
Indemnifying Party of its obligations under this Section 15, except to the
extent that such Indemnifying Party is prejudiced as a result thereof.

 

(ii) In the case of a Third Party Claim, except pursuant to the last sentence
of this Section 15(d)(ii), the Indemnifying Parties shall have the right at
any time upon written notice to the Indemnified Parties to conduct and control
at its expense and through counsel of its own choosing the defense against
such Third Party Claim. In the event that the Indemnifying Parties elect
to conduct the defense of such Third Party Claim, (A) the Indemnified Parties
will cooperate in all reasonable respects with the Indemnifying Parties and
its attorneys in such defense and (B) the Indemnifying Parties will not be
liable to the Indemnified Parties for legal expenses subsequently incurred by
the Indemnified Parties in connection with the defense thereof. In any such
Third Party Claim, the Indemnified Party shall have the right to retain its
own counsel, but the fees and expenses of such counsel shall be at its own
expense unless (x) the Indemnifying Party and the Indemnified Party mutually
agree to the retention of such counsel, or (y) the Indemnifying Party and the
Indemnified Party have actual or potential differing defenses or conflicts of
interests between them that make joint representation inappropriate, then in
all such cases of clauses (x) and (y), the Indemnifying Party shall pay,
promptly as statements therefor are received, the reasonable fees and
expenses of such counsel for the Indemnified Party; provided, that the
Indemnifying Party shall not be obligated to pay the fees of more than one
separate counsel (plus one separate local counsel in each applicable
jurisdiction) for the Indemnified Parties. Without the prior written consent
of the Indemnified Parties (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed), the Indemnifying Party will not enter into any
settlement of any Third Party Claim or cease to defend against such Third
Party Claim,

 



63  if pursuant to or as a result of such settlement or cessation, (A)
injunctive or other equitable relief could be imposed against the Indemnified
Parties (or in the case of the Purchaser Indemnitees, MWV-EED or any of its
Subsidiaries), (B) such settlement or cessation would (or would reasonably be
likely to) lead to liability or create any financial or other obligation on
the part of the Indemnified Party (or in the case of the Purchaser
Indemnitees, MWV-EED or any of its Subsidiaries) for which the Indemnified
Parties are not entitled to indemnification hereunder, or (C) such settlement
or cessation could include a statement or admission of fault, culpability
or failure to act by or on behalf of any Indemnified Party. Provided that an
Indemnified Party has given the Indemnifying Party a Claim Notice of a Third
Party Claim as required hereunder, unless an Indemnifying Party assumes the
defense of the Third Party Claim, the Indemnified Party may defend against
the Third Party Claim in any manner it may reasonably deem appropriate, and
the Indemnifying Party shall be bound by any final determination with respect
to such Third Party Claim prior to such assumption; provided, however, that
the Indemnified Party may not agree to any settlement without the consent of
the Indemnifying Person (which consent will not be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed). Each Party shall reasonably cooperate with the other
Parties by providing records and information on a timely basis that are
reasonably relevant to any Third Party Claim, and shall in good faith
regularly consult with counsel for the other Parties and include such counsel
in relevant conferences and proceedings to the extent requested by such
counsel.

(e) If, following the date hereof but prior to the Closing Date, Purchaser
obtains actual knowledge of any fact, circumstance or information that would
cause one or more of the representations and warranties made by Seller to be
inaccurate as of the date made or as of the Closing Date, to the extent
that Purchaser, upon actually determining the presence of such inaccuracy,
does not, within five (5) Business Days, provide Seller with notice of such
fact, circumstance or information, the Purchaser Indemnitees shall not have
any right or remedy after the Closing with respect to such inaccuracy and
shall be deemed to have waived its rights to indemnification in respect
thereof. _Provided, however,_ that this Paragraph shall be inoperable as to
any changes or updates to Sellers Disclosures, whether or not Purchaser had
actual, imputed or implied knowledge of such changes or updates.

(f) Each of the indemnification obligations of Seller and Purchaser under
this Section 15 is subject to the following limitations:

(i) An Indemnifying Party shall not be liable for any claim for
indemnification pursuant to Section 15(b)(i) or Section 15(c)(i), unless and
until the aggregate amount of all Losses which may be recovered from the
applicable Indemnifying Parties under this Agreement equals or exceeds Five
Million Dollars ($5,000,000) and then only for the amount of such Losses with
respect to such matters in excess of such amount, up to an aggregate maximum
amount equal to ten percent (10%) of the Purchase Price; provided that the
limitations set forth in this subclause shall not apply to a breach of the
representations and warranties set forth in Section 3.2(c).

 



64 (ii) The amount of any Loss shall be reduced by any amount received by the
Indemnified Party (or an Affiliate) with respect thereto under any third
party insurance coverage (including any Title Policy) or from any other person
(excluding an Affiliate of the Indemnified Party) alleged to be responsible
therefore, net of any expense incurred by the Indemnified Party in collecting
such amount. Any Indemnified Party that makes a claim for indemnification
under this Section 15 shall use commercially reasonable efforts, at the
Indemnifying Partys cost and expense, to collect any amount available under
any such insurance coverage and from any such other person alleged to have
responsibility. If an Indemnified Party (or an affiliate) receives an amount
under insurance coverage or from such other person with respect to a Loss at
any time subsequent to any indemnification provided the Indemnifying Party
pursuant to this Section 15, then such Indemnified Party shall promptly
reimburse the Indemnifying Party for any payment made or expense incurred by
the Indemnifying Party in connection with providing such indemnification up
to such amount received by the Indemnified Party, net of any expense incurred
by the Indemnified Party in collecting such amount.

 

(g) Except as otherwise set forth in this Agreement or any document to be
delivered at Closing, including the Deeds, from and after the Closing each
Party hereby acknowledges and agrees that its respective sole and exclusive
remedy with respect to any and all Claims against the other Parties and their
Affiliates with respect to any and all matters arising under or by reason of
this Agreement shall be pursuant to the indemnification provisions contained
in this Section 15 and shall be in lieu of any rights the Parties may have
under applicable law with respect thereto, except in the case of any Loss
suffered as a result of or in connection with a Partys fraud or intentional,
knowing or willful misstatement or breach. Without limiting the generality of
the foregoing and for the avoidance of doubt, a Loss suffered by Party as a
result of another Partys fraud or intentional, knowing or willful
misstatement or breach of a representation or warranty by Seller set forth in
Section 14 shall not be subject to the limitations set forth in Section 15(f)
herein.

 

16\. _No Brokerage Commission_. Other than with respect to the services of
Merrill Lynch Pierce, Fenner and Smith Incorporated and Goldman Sachs and Co.,
Seller warrants and represents to Purchaser that Seller has not incurred any
liability for any brokerage fee or commission in connection with the execution
and delivery of this Agreement or the consummation of the Transactions, and
the payment of Merrill Lynch Pierce, Fenner and Smith Incorporated and Goldman
Sachs and Co., shall be the sole obligation of Seller. Purchaser warrants and
represents to Seller that Purchaser has not incurred any liability for any
brokerage fee or commission in connection with the execution and delivery of
this Agreement or the consummation of the Transactions. Seller and Purchaser
each agree to indemnify and hold harmless the other from any and all damage,
loss, liability, expense and claim (including reasonable attorneys fees and
court costs) arising with respect to any such fee or commission which may be
suffered by the indemnified Party by reason of any action or agreement of the
indemnifying Party. This Section 16 shall survive the termination,
cancellation or expiration of this Agreement.

 



65 17\. _Employees and Benefit Plans_. __

 

17.1. _Employee Offers and Related Matters._

 

(a) As soon as reasonably practicable following the Closing Date, Seller shall
pay to each Transitioning Employee all accrued compensation due to them
through the close of business on the Closing Date.

(b) Seller shall cooperate with Purchaser to make the Timberland
Employees available for interview with Purchaser at mutually agreeable times
and locations; provided that Purchaser agrees that such interviews shall not
interfere unreasonably with the operation of Sellers business. In addition to
those positions that Purchaser establishes to oversee the Assets, Purchaser
agrees to consider Sellers Timberland Employees for any open positions within
the company, and to offer employees the same relocation benefits it would
offer to any new hire of Purchaser. Purchaser shall extend written offers of
employment not less than fifteen (15) days before Closing to each of the
Timberland Employees it intends to hire. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary contained in this Agreement, Purchaser agrees that the aggregate
number of Timberland Employees to whom Purchaser shall extend offers of
employment under this Section 17.1(b) shall be no less than twenty-three (23)
Timberland Employees. Each offer of employment contemplated by this Section
17.1(b) shall: (i) be contingent upon such Timberland Employees passing
Purchasers mandatory applicant substance abuse test and background check,
(ii) be effective subject to and as of the Closing, (iii) provide for a base
salary or wage no less favorable than the base salary or wage provided to such
Timberland Employee immediately prior to the Closing, and (iv) provide for
employee benefits that are substantially comparable to the employee benefits
provided to other similarly situated employees of Purchaser. Those Timberland
Employees who accept an offer of employment with Purchaser and who
subsequently pass Purchasers mandatory applicant substance abuse test
are referred to as "Transitioning Employees." Those Timberland Employees who
do not accept such offers of employment, or who accept such offers but who
subsequently fail Purchasers mandatory applicant substance abuse test, are
referred to as "Nontransitioning Employees." Purchaser agrees that it will
conduct all mandatory applicant substance abuse tests and background checks
and determine whether any tested employees fail prior to the Closing Date.
Purchaser further agrees that, during the twelve (12) month period following
the Closing, each Transitioning Employee who remains employed by Purchaser or
its Subsidiaries shall be provided with a base salary or wage no less
favorable than the base salary or wage provided to such Timberland Employee
immediately prior to Closing and employee benefits that are substantially
comparable to the employee benefits provided to similarly situated employees
of Purchaser.

 

(c) Effective from and after the first day after Closing, Purchaser shall
assume and become solely responsible for any and all liabilities with respect
to the employment or termination of employment of Transitioning Employees,
including any liabilities relating to or arising in connection with any actual
or constructive termination of any such Transitioning Employees
employment by Purchaser or its Subsidiaries after the Closing. Purchaser
agrees

 



66  that it will not take any action with respect to Transitioning Employees
that would cause Seller to incur any liability under the Worker Adjustment and
Retraining Notification Act of 1988, as amended ("WARN") or any similar
applicable federal or state law or regulation. From and after the Closing,
Seller shall remain solely responsible for any and all liabilities for: (i)
accrued but unpaid salaries, wages, vacation or sick pay, deferred
compensation or other similar payroll items arising as a result of services
rendered by any Timberland Employee to Seller at any time prior to the
Closing; and (ii) for any actions taken by Seller at any time prior to
the Closing with respect to any Timberland Employee or with respect to any
employee benefits plans sponsored, maintained or contributed to by Seller in
respect of such Timberland Employee. Each Transitioning Employee will be
credited with his or her years of employment service with Seller for purposes
of determining eligibility, vesting and benefit accrual under the applicable
employee benefit plans of Purchaser and its Subsidiaries; provided that such
service shall not be credited for purposes of benefit accrual under any final
average pay defined benefit pension plan or where such credit would result in
a duplication of benefits. In addition, during the twelve-month period
following the Closing, each Transitioning Employee who suffers a termination
of employment shall receive severance benefits from Purchaser or its
Subsidiaries that are no less favorable than those provided to such
Transitioning Employee immediately prior to the Closing, taking into account
service with Seller and its Affiliates prior to the Closing and Purchaser and
its Affiliates following the Closing.

(d) From and after the Closing, Seller shall remain solely responsible for
any and all liabilities with respect to the Nontransitioning Employees for all
claims arising under WARN, the Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reorganization Act,
as amended ("COBRA"), disability plans sponsored, maintained or contributed
to by Seller in respect of such Nontransitioning Employees, the Family and
Medical Leave Act of 1993, as amended, or retirement plans sponsored,
maintained or contributed to by Seller in respect of such
Nontransitioning Employees. From and after the Closing, Seller also shall
remain solely responsible for: (i) disability benefits payable under any
disability benefit plan sponsored, maintained or contributed to by Seller to
those Timberland Employees who, on the Closing Date, are on long or short-
term disability status and are entitled to benefits under such plans; and (ii)
post-retirement health and life insurance benefits payable under the terms of
any plan sponsored, maintained or contributed to by Seller that provides such
post-retirement benefits to former employees of Seller and their eligible
spouses and dependents who, on the Closing Date, are receiving such post-
retirement benefits under such plan.

 

(e) For two (2) years after the date hereof, Seller shall not directly or
indirectly, without the prior written consent of Purchaser, recruit, offer
employment to, employ (including employment as a consultant), lure or entice
away or in any other manner persuade or attempt to persuade any Transitioning
Employee or an employee of Purchaser or any Subsidiary of Purchaser to
leave the employ of Purchaser unless such persons employment has been
terminated by the Purchaser or the applicable Subsidiary thereof; provided,
however, that Seller and their Subsidiaries shall not be prohibited from: (i)
soliciting or hiring any Transitioning Employee whose employment with
Purchaser or its applicable Subsidiary has been terminated at

 



67  least thirty (30) days prior to the initiation of such employment
discussions; or (ii) from hiring a Transitioning Employee who responds to a
public job announcement, including through a bona fide search firm (but only
so long as not specifically directed at such individuals), it being agreed
that any such public job announcement shall not violate the terms of this
Section 17.1(e).

 

17.2. _Retirement Plans_.

 

(a) _Pre-Closing/Post-Closing Allocation_. Subject to the balance of this
Section 17, Seller will retain all liability and responsibility for the
disposition of interests under the Seller 401(k) Plan ("Investment Plan") and
the Seller pension plan ("Retirement Plan") with respect to those
Transitioning Employees or their beneficiaries who, as of the Closing Date,
are participants in the Investment Plan or Retirement Plan, as applicable.
Effective as of the Closing, Transitioning Employees shall cease to be active
participants in the Investment Plan and the Retirement Plan and no
Transitioning Employee will be eligible to make any contributions to the
Investment Plan or accrue benefits under the Retirement Plan and Seller will
not be obligated to make any contribution with respect to any such participant
in the Investment Plan on or after the Closing Date.

(b) _Purchaser s Plans_.

 

 (i) _Defined Benefit Retirement Plans_. Purchaser agrees that, (A) effective as of the first day after the Closing Date, Transitioning Employees shall be eligible to participate in Purchasers defined benefit plan(s) on the same basis as the Purchasers similarly situated employees are then eligible to participate, and (B) Purchaser shall recognize under each of Purchasers defined benefit plans all the Transitioning Employees service with Seller completed prior to the Closing for purposes of eligibility to participate and vesting under each such plan, but not for purposes of determining the amount of benefit accrual under the plan. 

 

 (ii) _Defined Contribution Plans_. Purchaser agrees that, effective as of the first day of the month after their hire, Transitioning Employees shall be eligible to participate in Purchasers existing Purchaser defined contribution plans on the same basis as Purchasers similarly situated employees are then eligible to participate. 

17.3. _Welfare Plans_.

 

(a) _Seller s Plans_. Seller shall remain solely responsible for liabilities
for any claims incurred under the health insurance plans of Seller and its
Affiliates by any Transitioning Employees and his or her eligible dependents
through the end of the month in which the Closing occurs, and, if the Closing
occurs in November 2013, Seller shall continue, through December 31, 2013, to
provide health insurance under the health insurance plans of Seller and its
Affiliates to the Transitioning Employees and their eligible dependents and,
no later than five Business Days following receipt of a written invoice
therefor, Purchaser shall reimburse Seller for 102% of the December 2013
health insurance premiums corresponding to

 



68  such Transitioning Employees. From and after the Closing, Seller shall
remain solely responsible for liabilities for claims of the Transitioning
Employees and their eligible dependents incurred prior to the Closing under
those plans that are disability, accident or life insurance plans, and
Purchaser shall be solely responsible for all such liabilities for claims
incurred by any Transitioning Employee or his or her eligible
dependents after the Closing, except as noted in the immediately preceding
sentence. If (i) the Closing occurs in a month other than November, 2013, then
from and after the first day of the month following the month in which the
Closing occurs, Purchaser shall be solely responsible for all liabilities for
any claims incurred under the health insurance plans of Purchaser and its
Affiliates incurred by any Transitioning Employee or his or her eligible
dependents on or after the first day of the month following the month in
which the Closing occurs. If Closing occurs in November 2013, then, from and
after January 1, 2014, Purchaser shall be solely responsible for all
liabilities for any claims incurred under the health insurance plans
of Purchaser and its Affiliates incurred by any Transitioning Employee or his
or her eligible dependents on or after January 1, 2014. For the purposes of
this Section 17.3, a claim for health benefits shall be deemed to have been
incurred when the services that are the subject of such claim are rendered
and a claim for disability, accident or life insurance shall be deemed to have
been incurred when the last event giving rise to such claim occurs. This
Section 17.3(a) shall not be construed to require Purchaser to provide
health, disability, accident or life insurance plans that are the same or
similar to plans that Seller currently provides to the Timberland Employees.

 

(b) _Purchaser s Plans_. Effective from and after the Closing (or, in the
case of health insurance plans, the first day of the month following the
month in which the Closing occurs if the Closing occurs in a month other than
November 2013, or if the Closing occurs in November 2013, from and after
January 1, 2014), Purchaser shall cause each Transitioning Employee and his
or her eligible dependents to become eligible to participate immediately in
each employee welfare benefit plan (as such term is defined in Section 3(1) of
ERISA) sponsored, maintained or contributed to by Purchaser or any of its
Subsidiaries and each other benefit arrangement sponsored, maintained or
contributed to by Purchaser for the benefit of similarly situated employees of
Purchaser ("Purchaser Health and Welfare Plans"). For purposes of each
Purchaser Health and Welfare Plan providing medical, dental, pharmaceutical
and/or vision benefits to any Transitioning Employee, Purchaser shall use its
commercially reasonable efforts to cause all pre-existing condition
exclusions, other than the pre-existing condition exclusion for transplants,
and actively-at-work requirements of such plan to be waived for such employee
and his or her covered dependents ("Seller Health and Welfare Plans") in which
such employee participated immediately prior to the Closing, and Purchaser
shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to cause any eligible expenses
incurred by such employee and his or her covered dependents during the portion
of the plan year of the Seller Health and Welfare Plans ending on the date
such employees participation in the corresponding Purchaser Health and
Welfare Plan begins to be taken into account under such Purchaser Health and
Welfare Plan for purposes of satisfying all deductible, coinsurance and
maximum out-of pocket requirements applicable to such employee and his or her
covered dependents for the applicable plan year as if such amounts had been
paid in accordance with such Purchaser Health and Welfare Plan. In

  



69  addition, provided that Seller currently provides long term disability to
the Timberland Employees, Purchaser agrees to ensure that Purchasers Long
Term Disability Plan recognizes each Transitioning Employees years of
employment service with Seller to the extent permitted by such Long Term
Disability Plan.

(c)  _Cooperation of Parties to Ensure Coverage_. Purchaser and Seller shall
cooperate in ensuring that welfare benefit coverage for Transitioning
Employees and their eligible dependents on and prior to the Closing is
coordinated with such coverage provided after the Closing.

17.4. _Amendment and Modification of Plans_. Except as expressly provided in
Sections 17.2 and 17.3, nothing contained in this Section 17 or any other
provision of this Agreement shall limit the rights of Purchaser or Seller to
amend, modify or terminate from time to time or at any time any of their
respective benefit plans, or confer on any third party, including, but not
limited to, any Transitioning Employee, any rights as a third-party
beneficiary of the provisions herein.

 

17.5. _Worker s Compensation_. From and after the Closing: (a) Seller shall
remain solely responsible for all workers compensation claims of any
Nontransitioning Employees and for workers compensation claims of any
Transitioning Employees that are based on any accident that occurred or injury
that was documented prior to Closing, and (b) Purchaser shall be solely
responsible for all workers compensation claims of any Transitioning
Employees that are based on any accident that occurred or injury that occurred
on or after Closing.

 

18\. _Taxes; Expenses; Prorations_. __

 

(a) Ad valorem real property Taxes on the Assets and special assessments, as
well as revenue, rents, royalties, prepaid royalties/minimum royalties, and
deposits under the Timberlands Contracts, Mineral Leases and Kapstone FSAs to
the extent such Timberlands Contracts, Mineral Leases and Kapstone FSAs affect
the Assets, shall be prorated as of the Closing Date, credited to
Purchaser, or, with respect to those items set forth on _Exhibit 46_ , credit
to Seller, as appropriate. If actual Tax bills for the Taxable year of the
Closing are not available, said Taxes shall be prorated based on Tax bills for
the previous Taxable year and the Parties agree to cause a re-proration of
said Taxes upon the receipt of Tax bills for the taxable year of the Closing.
If any portion of the Assets is not designated by a separate Tax parcel, said
Taxes shall be adjusted to an amount bearing the same relationship to the
total Tax bill which the acreage contained within the applicable portion of
the Assets bears to the acreage contained within the property included within
said Tax bill. Purchaser and Seller shall reasonably cooperate in good faith
to cause all real property Taxes on the Assets to be paid (and to reimburse
the appropriate Party making such payments, as applicable), to the extent
subdivisions or changes of ownership are not reflected on future
real property Tax bills. Any "rollback" Taxes assessed against the Assets as
a result of Purchasers change in the use of the Assets or failure to maintain
the Timberlands in any property Tax reduction program shall be paid by
Purchaser within thirty (30) days of final determination thereof.

 



70 (b) Purchaser shall pay (or, to the extent required to be paid by Seller,
shall promptly reimburse Seller) (i) one-half (1/2) of all costs in
connection with the recording of the Deeds (other than the South Carolina deed
recording fee, if any, imposed pursuant to Title 12 Section 24 of the South
Carolina Code that may be applicable to the Transactions, which shall be
Sellers responsibility), (ii) one-half (1/2) of the Virginia grantee/buyer
Tax imposed pursuant to Va. Code Ann. Sec. 58.1, (iii) all costs of purchasing
any Title Policy and any endorsements thereto, including any coordination
fees of the Title Company in connection therewith, (iv) all costs of
Purchasers due diligence, (v) all costs of Purchasers legal representation,
and (vi) one-half (1/2) of any other Transfer Taxes (including any Transfer
Taxes imposed in respect of the transactions described in Section 4 hereof).

 

(c) Seller shall pay (or, to the extent required to be paid by Purchaser,
shall promptly reimburse Purchaser) (i) one-half (1/2) of all costs in
connection with the recording of the Deeds (other than the South Carolina deed
recording fee, if any, imposed pursuant to Title 12 Section 24 of the South
Carolina Code that may be applicable to the Transactions, which shall
be Sellers responsibility), (ii) all costs of searching title and producing
the Title Commitments, (iii) one-half (1/2) of the Virginia grantee/buyer Tax
imposed pursuant to Va. Code Ann. Sec. 58.1, (iv) one-half (1/2) of any other
Transfer Taxes (including any Transfer Taxes imposed in respect of the
transactions described in Section 4 hereof), (iv) all costs of the Phase I
Reports (including the cost of relevant portions of previous reports that
were updated to produce the Phase I Reports), (v) all costs of Sellers legal
representation, and (vi) any "rollback" Taxes that may be due on transfer of
the Timberlands except those that are Purchasers responsibility under
Section 18(a) above.

(d) Except as set forth in this Agreement, all other costs shall be borne by
the Party incurring them. 

19\. _Closing Conditions_. __

 

(a) The obligations of each of Seller and Purchaser to consummate the
Transactions shall be subject to the satisfaction or waiver, on or before the
Closing Date, of the following condition:

(i) There shall be no injunction, restraining order or decree of any nature
of any court or Governmental Authority that is in effect that restrains or
prohibits the consummation of the Transactions.

 

(ii) In the event that a Governmental Authority having jurisdiction notifies
the Parties in writing that it has determined that filings are required under
the HSR Act and Rules with respect to the Transactions, (A) the Parties shall
promptly (but in any event no later than five (5) Business Days after receipt
of such notice) submit their respective filings (including a notification and
report form under the HSR Act and Rules with respect to the Transactions) in
accordance with Section 9, (B) each of the Parties shall seek early
termination of the waiting period under the HSR Act 

 



71  and (C) the Parties shall use their respective reasonable best efforts to
respond to any request for additional information or documentary material made
by any such Governmental Authority and to cause all waiting periods
applicable under the HSR Act and Rules to terminate or expire at the earliest
possible date and to resist in good faith, at each of their respective cost
and expense (including the institution or defense of legal proceedings), any
assertion that the Transactions constitute a violation of any antitrust laws,
all to the end of expediting consummation of the Transactions. Each of
Purchaser and Seller shall consult with the other prior to any meetings,
by telephone or in person, with the staff of the Federal Trade Commission,
the Antitrust Division of the United States Department of Justice or any other
Governmental Authority, to the extent permitted by such Governmental
Authority, and each of Purchaser and Seller shall have the right to have a
representative present at any such meeting. In the event any waiting period
applicable under the HSR Act and Rules has not expired or been terminated by
the Closing Date, the Closing Date shall be five (5) days following
expiration or termination of the applicable waiting period under the HSR Act
and Rules, but no later than the Outside Closing Date.

 

(b) Unless waived by Purchaser, the obligations of Purchaser to consummate the
Transactions shall be further subject to the fulfillment in all respects, on

warranty and representation expressly relates to an earlier date, in which
case as of such earlier date), in all material respects, of each and every
warranty and representation herein made by Seller (without giving effect to
any limitation or qualification as to materiality or Material Adverse Effect
set forth therein); provided that no such representation or warranty of Seller
will be deemed untrue or incorrect for the purposes of this Section 19(b)(i)
as a consequence of the existence of any fact, event, change, condition,
development, circumstance or effect inconsistent with such representation or
warranty, unless such fact, event, change, condition,
development, circumstance or effect, individually or taken together with all
other facts, events, changes, conditions, developments, circumstances or
effects inconsistent with any representation or warranty of Seller, would
reasonably be likely to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Material
Adverse Effect;

(ii) Sellers timely performance of and compliance with, in all material
respects, each and every term, condition, covenant, agreement, restriction and
obligation to be performed and complied with by Seller under this Agreement,
including the delivery of the Sellers Closing Documents;

 

(iii) Seller shall have delivered to Purchaser a certificate in form and
substance reasonably satisfactory to Purchaser dated as of the Closing Date

and

 



72 (iv) Purchasers receipt of a binding Title Commitment from the Title Company
to issue Title Policies, endorsed with forms ALTA 15 and ALTA 15.1 (Non-
Imputation), as appropriate, (subject only to Purchasers payment of the
premiums therefor and satisfaction of any Purchaser obligations under the
Title Commitment) insuring (A) Purchasers title to the Timberlands, and (B)
the appropriate title-holding entitys title to the JV1 and JV2 Properties, in
each case following the Closing, subject only to the Permitted Encumbrances
(and excluding in all events insurance as to the Reserved Interests, Mineral
Rights, riparian and water rights or similar rights or interests in connection
therewith).

 

(c) Unless waived by Seller, the obligations of Seller to consummate the
Transactions shall be further subject to the fulfillment in all respects, on
or before the Closing Date, of the following conditions precedent:

(i) the truth and accuracy as of the Closing Date (except to the extent such
warranty and representation expressly relates to an earlier date, in which
case as of such earlier date), in all material respects, of each and every
warranty and representation herein made by Purchaser (other than the those
set forth in Section 14(b)(xiii)). The warranties and representations of
Purchaser that are set forth in Section 14(b)(xiii) shall be true and correct
in all respects as of the Closing Date as if made as of such date;

 

(ii) Purchasers timely performance of and compliance with, in all material
respects, each and every term, condition, agreement, restriction and
obligation to be performed and complied with by Purchaser under this
Agreement, including the delivery of the Purchasers Closing Documents;

 

(iii) Purchaser shall have delivered to Seller a certificate in form and
substance reasonably satisfactory to Seller dated as of the Closing Date and
signed by a duly authorized officer of Purchaser to the effect that the
conditions set forth in Sections 19(c)(i) and 19(c)(ii) have been satisfied;
and

 

(iv) Purchaser shall have delivered to Seller a fully executed copy of a
letter consistent in all material respects with  _Exhibit 47_ attached hereto
(the "Borrowing Capacity Evidence"), which letter shall state that the

the Farm Credit System (the "Existing Funded Indebtedness") and undrawn
revolving borrowing commitments in the Farm Credit System (treating all such
commitments to borrow as being fully drawn for purposes of this provision)
(the "Existing Borrowing Commitments" and together with the Existing Funded
Indebtedness, the "Existing Indebtedness") is not in excess of $226,000,000.

 



73 20\. _Default; Remedies; Termination._

 

(a) The Parties agree that monetary damages may not be an adequate remedy in
the event that any of the provisions of this Agreement were not performed in
accordance with their specific terms. It is agreed that the Parties shall be
entitled to seek equitable relief including injunctive relief and specific
performance of the terms hereof, this being in addition to any other remedies
to which they are entitled at law or equity, except as otherwise specifically
provided in this Agreement. Each Party hereby waives any requirement of any
posting of bond.

 

(b) This Agreement and the Transactions may be terminated, at any time prior
to the Closing Date (the date of any such termination, the " _Termination
Date_ "), at the terminating Partys option and, except as otherwise set forth
in this Agreement, as its sole remedy, in the following circumstances:

 

(i) by the mutual written consent of Purchaser and Seller;

 

(ii) by Purchaser, if the Transactions have not been consummated on or before
the Outside Closing Date; provided that Purchaser shall not be entitled to
terminate this Agreement pursuant to this Section 20(b)(ii) if Purchasers
breach of any obligation, representation or warranty under this Agreement has
prevented the consummation of the Transactions on or prior to such date;

(iii) by Seller, if the Transactions have not been consummated on or before
Outside Closing Date; provided that Seller shall not be entitled to terminate
this Agreement pursuant to this Section 20(b)(ii) if Sellers breach of any
obligation, representation or warranty under this Agreement has prevented the
consummation of the Transactions on or prior to such date;

(iv) by Purchaser, if Seller has breached any representation, warranty,
covenant or agreement contained in this Agreement, or if any representation
or warranty of Seller has become untrue, in each case, such that the
conditions set forth in Section 19(a) or Section 19(b), as the case may be,
could not be satisfied as of the Closing Date; provided, however, that
Purchaser may not terminate this Agreement pursuant to this Section 20(b)(iv)
unless any such breach or failure to be true has not been cured within thirty
(30) days after written notice by Purchaser to Seller informing Seller of
such breach or failure to be true, except that no cure period shall be
required for a breach which by its nature cannot be cured prior to the Outside
Closing Date; and, provided, further that Purchaser may not terminate this
Agreement pursuant to this Section 20(b)(iv) if Purchaser is then in breach of
this Agreement in any material respect;

 



74 (v) by Seller, if Purchaser has breached any representation, warranty,
covenant or agreement contained in this Agreement, or if any representation
or warranty of Purchaser has become untrue, in each case, such that the
conditions set forth in Section 19(a) or Section 19(c), as the case may be,
could not be satisfied as of the Closing Date; provided, however, that Seller
may not terminate this Agreement pursuant to this Section 20(b)(v) unless any
such breach or failure to be true has not been cured within thirty (30) days
after written notice by Seller to Purchaser informing Purchaser of such
breach or failure to be true, except that no cure period shall be required for
a breach which by its nature cannot be cured prior to the Outside Closing
Date; and, provided, further that Seller may not terminate this Agreement
pursuant to this Section 20(b)(v) if Seller is then in breach of this
Agreement in any material respect;

 

(vi) by Purchaser, if there has been a Material Adverse Effect;

 

(vii) by Purchaser or Seller, if the aggregate total of Title Carveouts,
Environmental Carveouts and Casualty Damage Value exceeds the Loss Threshold;
or

(viii) by Purchaser or Seller, if any Governmental Authority shall have issued
an order or decree or taken any other action, in each case permanently
restraining, enjoining or otherwise prohibiting the Transactions and such
order or decree or other action shall have become final and non-appealable.

 

(c) If this Agreement is terminated pursuant to Section 20(b), such
termination shall be without liability to any Party to this Agreement or any
Affiliate, shareholder, member, director, manager or representative of such
Party, except that (i) Sections 9(a), 11, 15, 16, this Section 20(c), 22-34,
36, 38-39 shall survive in accordance with their terms and (ii)
nothing herein shall relieve any Party for liability for willful misconduct,
fraud or any intentional breach of this Agreement

(d) Notwithstanding anything contained in this Section 20, no Party shall be
liable to the other Parties for any indirect, incidental, consequential or
special damages suffered by such other Parties, including lost revenues or
lost profits, whether arising in contract, tort, negligence, strict
liability, breach of statutory duty or otherwise, and regardless of any notice
of the possibility of such damages.

 

21\. _No Solicitation._ From the date hereof until the earlier of the Closing
or the termination of this Agreement for any reason Seller, except as
permitted under the terms of this Agreement (including Section 7(g)), shall
not, directly or indirectly: (a) initiate, solicit or encourage any proposal
or offer from any person (other than Purchaser or its Affiliates) relating to
the sale or transfer of any Assets, whether in a single transaction or in a
series of related transactions, except for the sales and dispositions
expressly set forth on Schedules 12(b) or 14; (b) participate in any
discussions or negotiations or enter into any agreement with any person
(other than Purchaser or its Affiliates) relating to any sale or transfer of
any Assets, whether in a single transaction or in a series of related
transactions, except for the sales and dispositions expressly set forth on
Schedules 12(b) or 14; (c) accept any proposal or offer from any person

 



75  (other than Purchaser or its Affiliates) to sell or transfer any of the
Assets, whether in a single transaction or in a series of related
transactions, except for the sales and dispositions expressly set forth on
Schedules 12(b) or 14; or (d) direct any of the officers, directors, managers,
employees, investment bankers, financial advisors, attorneys, accountants or
other representatives or agents of Seller, or any of their Subsidiaries to do
any of the things prohibited by this Section 21\.

22\. _Assignment._ Except as otherwise expressly contemplated by this
Agreement, neither Party shall assign its rights or obligations hereunder, in
whole or in part, without the prior written consent of the other Party, given
or withheld in its sole discretion. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Seller or
Purchaser shall have the right to assign their respective rights and
obligations under this Agreement to any party controlling, controlled by, or
under common control with Seller or Purchaser, provided that no such
assignment shall relieve Seller or Purchaser of any liability hereunder or be
reasonably likely to prevent, delay or impede Closing; provided that, without
the prior consent of Seller, PCT shall not have the right to assign to any
Person (including any Affiliate of PCT) its obligation hereunder to issue the
Note.

23\. _No Waiver._ Except as specifically set forth herein, no action or
failure to act by any Party shall constitute a waiver of any right or duty
afforded to such Party under this Agreement, nor shall any such action or
failure to act constitute an approval of or acquiescence in any breach of this
Agreement except as may be specifically agreed in writing.

24\. _Governing Law; Jurisdiction_. This Agreement shall be governed in all
respects, including validity, construction, interpretation and effect, by the
laws of the State of Delaware without giving effect to its principles or rules
of conflicts of law to the extent such principles or rules would require or
permit the application of the laws of another jurisdiction. Each Party
irrevocably submits to the jurisdiction of (a) the state courts of the State
of Delaware and (b) the United States District Court for the District of
Delaware in connection with any proceeding arising out of or relating hereto
or the Transactions, and hereby irrevocably agrees that all claims in respect
of such proceeding shall be heard and determined in such state or federal
court. Each Party hereby irrevocably waives (and agrees not to plead or
claim) any objection to the laying of venue of any proceeding arising out of
or relating hereto or the Transactions in the (A) the state courts of the
State of Delaware, or (B) the United States District Court for the District
of Delaware, and the defense of an inconvenient forum to the maintenance of
such action or proceeding. The Parties hereto further agree, to the fullest
extent permitted by law, that final and non-appealable judgment against any of
them in any proceeding contemplated above shall be conclusive and may be
enforced in any other jurisdiction within or outside the United States by suit
on the judgment, a certified copy of which shall be conclusive evidence of the
fact and amount of such judgment. Each Party agrees that service of process,
summons, notice or document by U.S. registered mail to such persons
respective address set forth in Section 25 shall be effective service of
process for any proceeding with respect to any matters to which it has
submitted to jurisdiction pursuant to this Section 24\. To the extent that any
Party has or hereafter may acquire any immunity from jurisdiction of any court
or from any legal process (whether through service or notice, attachment
prior to judgment, attachment in aid of execution, execution or otherwise)
with respect to itself or its property, each Party hereby irrevocably waives
such immunity in respect of its obligations hereunder.

postage, pre-paid, United States Mail, certified or registered, return receipt
requested, or by a recognized overnight carrier, or by facsimile or e-mail, to
the other Party at the addresses set forth below, and such address as may be

77 26\. _Entire Agreement._ This Agreement, all Exhibits attached hereto and
the Confidentiality Agreement contain the entire agreement among the Parties
with respect to the subject matter hereof and cannot be amended or
supplemented except by a written agreement signed by the Parties.

 

27\. _Captions._ The captions of sections in this Agreement are for
convenience and reference only and are not part of the substance hereof.

28\. _Severability._ In the event that any one or more of the provisions,
sections, words, clauses, phrases or sentences contained in this Agreement,
or the application thereof in any circumstance is held invalid, illegal or
unenforceable in any respect for any reason, the validity, legality and
enforceability of any such provision, section, word, clause, phrase or
sentence in every other respect and of the remaining provisions, sections,
words, clauses, phrases or sentences of this Agreement, shall not be in any
way impaired, it being the intention of the Parties that this Agreement shall
be enforceable to the fullest extent permitted by law.

29\. _Counterparts._ This Agreement may be executed in several counterparts,
each of which may be deemed an original, and all of such counterparts together
shall constitute one and the same Agreement. This Agreement may be executed by
each Party upon a separate copy and attached to another copy in order to

30\. _Binding Effect._ This Agreement shall bind the Parties and their
respective heirs, legal representatives, successors and assigns.

31\. _Time of Essence._ Time is of the essence of this Agreement.

 

32\. _Survival._ Except and to the extent as may otherwise expressly be
provided herein, the provisions of this Agreement shall survive the Closing
and shall not be merged into the delivery of the Deeds and other documents and
the payment of all monies pursuant hereto at the Closing.

 

33\. _Incorporation of Exhibits._ All exhibits referred to in this Agreement
are hereby incorporated herein by this reference.

 

34\. _Confidentiality; Public Announcements._ Purchaser and Seller agree that
the terms and conditions of the Transactions are to remain confidential,
except that either Party and its Affiliates may disclose the terms and
provisions of this Agreement (i) to the extent that such Party or any of its
Affiliates is required by applicable law (including the rules and regulations
promulgated by the SEC or any stock exchange) to make public disclosure, or
(ii) in any legal proceeding, including any audit, to the extent necessary to
enforce any rights under this Agreement, provided that, in either case,
the disclosing Party shall provide the other Party with

 



78  prior notice of such disclosure and the content thereof. No press releases
or public statements concerning this Agreement or the Transactions will be
made by any party without the prior written approval of all parties. This
Section 34 shall survive any termination, cancellation or expiration of this
Agreement or the Closing.

 

35\. _Dispute Resolution_. If Seller asserts a Title Objection Dispute or an
Environmental Objection Dispute, or if Purchaser and Seller are unable to
agree as to size, configuration and other parameters of the Carveout, or any
Carveout with respect to the Personal Property, the values of the Value Table,
the value of a Title Objection Carveout under Section 7, the value of an
Environmental Carveout under Section 8(b), the Casualty Damage Value under
Section 12(b), or the value of a material adverse effect with respect to
determination of a Title Objection Carveout with respect to a JV1 Property or
a JV2 Property or the Personal Property (collectively, "Disputed Matter"),
then either of Seller or Purchaser shall have the right to invoke the
procedures of this Section 35 by delivering written notice to the other Party
promptly after the event giving rise to such dispute or disagreement. Seller
and Purchaser each shall appoint an independent forestry consultant (who shall
be an independent appraiser with experience in commercial timberlands,
minerals and forestland development property) within five (5) Business Days
following the delivery of such written notice, each of which may be a
consultant previously engaged by the appointing Party so long as the
appointing Party or the appraiser discloses to the other Party, with such
notice of appointment, all material relationships, affiliations and business
dealings that such proposed forestry consultant currently has or has had
during the three (3) year period prior to the date hereof with Purchaser,
Seller and each of their respective Affiliates, and such two consultants will
in turn select a third independent forestry consultant (subject to the same
qualification and disclosure requirements) within five (5) Business Days to
act with them in a panel to determine whether the Title Objection or
Environmental Condition has merit, and/or the disposition of any other
Disputed Matter; provided, however, if prior to the rendition of the
determination by the panel, if (a) with respect to any Title Objection, the
Title Company has removed any matter which is the subject of the Title
Objection, and/or (b) with respect to any Environmental Condition, the
Environmental Condition has been remediated to Purchasers reasonable
satisfaction and the environmental consultant responsible for the Phase I
which disclosed such Environmental Condition has certified as to such
remediation, in any such event such Dispute shall not be subject to the review
or determination of the panel. The panel shall make its determination based
on the particular relevant provisions of this Agreement, the applicable Title
Commitment and/or Phase I, the materials submitted by the parties hereunder
and such other materials that the panel may deem to be relevant to its
determination as described above. A majority of the panel of consultants will
reach a binding decision within thirty (30) days following the selection of
the third consultant, and the decision of the panel of consultants will
be binding on the Parties and final and non-appealable. Seller and Purchaser
will each bear the cost of its respective consultant and one-half (1/2) of the
cost of the third consultant, and shall otherwise bear their own costs and
expenses of dispute resolution. In accordance with Section 6(a), unless the
Parties mutually agree otherwise the Closing shall not take place until at
least ten (10) Business Days after the panels final determination of all
Disputed Matters (other than those related to the South Carolina Timberlands)
before the panel or the Outside Date, whichever is earlier. If there are any
Disputed Matters which are not finally resolved at the

 



79  Closing, the Parties shall work diligently and in good faith to pursue such
Disputed Matters to a final resolution as promptly as possible after the
Closing, and after such resolution, the Parties shall promptly make all
adjustments, payments, contributions or take such other action in good faith
as is provided herein or as may be necessary to implement such resolution;
provided, however, that if such disputed matter pertains to a Carveout, such
Carveout, as reasonably proposed by Purchaser, shall be excluded from the
Assets conveyed at Closing until such Disputed Matter is finally resolved. In
the event the Disputed Matter involves an Environmental Carveout, upon
resolution of the Disputed Matter in favor of Seller, Purchaser shall have
the election, within five (5) Business Days, to either (a) include the
Environmental Carveout in the Assets being purchased or (b) exclude the
Environmental Carveout (as determined (including the configuration of the
parcel) in such final resolution) from the Assets being purchased (and from
the applicable Deed), but in such event the Purchase Price shall not be
reduced and the value of the Environmental Carveout shall not be counted as a
Loss for the purposes of Paragraph 15(f)(i); provided that, in the event
Purchaser fails to make the election within said five (5) Business Days,
Purchaser shall be deemed to have elected subclause (b).

 

36\. _Business Days._ If any date set forth in this Agreement for the
performance of any obligation by any Party, or for the delivery of any
instrument or notice as herein provided, should occur on a non-Business Day,
the compliance with such obligation or delivery shall be deemed acceptable on
the next Business Day.

 

37\. _Tax Allocation._ The Purchase Price shall be allocated in accordance
with Section 1060 of the Code among the Timberlands, minerals, Timberlands
Contracts, and the Personal Property using the methodology mutually approved
by Seller and Purchaser in the manner set forth in this Section 37, provided
that such allocation methodology shall incorporate, reflect and be consistent
with (a) the allocation set forth in Section 2.1, (b) the Value Table (other
than the per acre values set forth therein) and (c) _Exhibit 48_ (the
"Allocation Framework"). No later than sixty (60) days after the Closing
Date, Seller shall deliver to Purchaser an allocation of the Purchase Price
among the Timberlands, minerals, Timberlands Contracts, and Personal Property,
which allocation shall be reasonable, based on fair market values, consistent
with the Code, shall incorporate, reflect and be consistent with the
Allocation Framework and to the extent relating to the portion of the Purchase
Price paid for the Timberlands, set forth an allocation between
the Installment Sale Timberlands and the Non-Installment Sale Timberlands
(the "Proposed Allocation"). No later than one hundred twenty (120) days after
the Closing Date, Seller and Purchaser shall endeavor to agree on the
Proposed Allocation. In the event that Seller and Purchaser have not so
agreed by such date Purchaser and Seller shall negotiate in good faith to
resolve the dispute. If Purchaser and Seller fail to agree on such allocation
before the date that is one hundred fifty (150) days following the Closing
Date, such allocation shall be determined, within a reasonable time and in a
manner that incorporates, reflects and is consistent with the Allocation
Framework, by an independent, nationally recognized firm of accountants
mutually selected by the Parties. The allocation of the total consideration,
as agreed upon by Purchaser and Seller or determined by a firm of accountants
under this Section 37, (the "Final Allocation") shall be final and binding
upon the Parties. Each of Purchaser and Seller shall bear all fees and costs
incurred by it in connection with the

 



80  determination of the allocation of the total consideration, except that the
Parties shall each pay fifty percent (50%) of the fees and expenses of such
accounting firm. Except to the extent otherwise required by applicable law,
(a) Seller and Purchaser agree to prepare and file an IRS Form 8594 for or
such other form or statement as may be required by applicable law, rule or
regulation, and any comparable state or local income Tax form, in a manner
consistent with the Final Allocation, (b) Seller and Purchaser shall adhere to
the Final Allocation for all Tax-related purposes including any federal,
foreign, state, county or local income and franchise Tax Return filed by them
after the Closing Date, including the determination by Seller of Taxable gain
or loss on the sale and the determination by Purchaser of its Tax basis with
respect to same, and (c) neither Purchaser nor Seller shall file any Tax
Return or, in a judicial or administrative proceeding, assert or maintain any
Tax reporting position that is inconsistent with this Agreement or the Final
Allocation agreed to in accordance with this Agreement.

 

38\. _Interpretation._ Seller and Purchaser have reviewed this Agreement and
each party has had the opportunity to consult with independent counsel with
respect to the terms hereof and has done so to the extent that such party
desired. No stricter construction or interpretation of the terms hereof shall
be applied against either party as the drafter hereof. Whenever the words
"include," "includes" or "including" are used in this Agreement, they shall be
deemed to be followed by the words "without limitation." All references to "$"
shall mean U.S. dollars.

 

39\. _Third Party Rights._ Except as expressly provided for herein, nothing in
this Agreement shall confer any rights upon any Person that is not a Party or
the successor or permitted assignee of a Party.

40\. _Consents; Releases_. __

 

(a) Seller and Purchaser agree to use commercially reasonable efforts to
obtain from the applicable counterparties under the Timberlands Contracts and
the Mineral Leases any required consents to such assignment or transfer to
Timberlands III, LLC or Purchaser, as applicable, on or before the Closing
Date; provided that neither Seller, Purchaser nor any of their respective
Affiliates shall be required to commence any litigation or offer or grant any
accommodation (financial or otherwise) to any third party to obtain such
authorizations, approvals, consents, negative clearances or waivers; and
provided, further, that neither Seller, Purchaser nor any of their respective
Affiliates shall be obligated to incur any monetary obligations or
expenditures to the parties whose consent is requested in connection with the
utilization of its commercially reasonable efforts to obtain any such
required consents.

(b) If any consent contemplated by Section 40(a) is not obtained as of the
Closing notwithstanding the Parties use of commercially reasonable efforts
as required thereunder, (i) Seller or its applicable Affiliate shall continue
to be bound by such arrangement and, unless not permitted by the terms thereof
or by law, Purchaser shall, as agent or subcontractor for Seller or such
applicable Affiliate, as applicable, pay, perform and discharge fully all the
obligations under the applicable Timberlands Contract or Mineral Lease that 

 



81  Purchaser would have been responsible for if such Timberlands Contract or
Mineral Lease would have been assigned to Timberlands III, LLC or Purchaser,
as applicable, as of the Closing, and (ii) Seller and each of its applicable
Affiliates, without further consideration, shall pay and remit to Purchaser,
promptly all money, rights and other consideration received by it in respect
of Purchasers performance as agent or subcontractor for Seller or its
applicable Subsidiary.

(c) If any consent contemplated by Section 40(a) is not obtained as of
the Closing notwithstanding the Parties use of commercially reasonable
efforts as required hereunder, the Parties shall continue for up to one (1)
year after the Closing to exercise commercially reasonable efforts to obtain
the related consents that could not be obtained prior to the Closing, and, if
such a consent is obtained, Seller shall assign to Timberlands III, LLC or
Purchaser, as applicable, and Timberlands III, LLC or Purchaser, as
applicable, shall assume, the applicable Timberlands Contract or Mineral
Lease pursuant to the terms of this Agreement.

(d) Each of Seller and Purchaser, at the request of the other Party, from the
date hereof through the first (1st) anniversary of the Closing, shall
reasonably cooperate with the requesting Partys efforts to obtain, or cause
to be obtained, in writing the unconditional release of Seller and
its applicable Subsidiaries that are parties to any Timberlands Contracts, so
that, from and after the Closing, neither Seller nor any of its Subsidiaries
shall be responsible for any liabilities or obligations under the Timberlands
Contracts that Timberlands III, LLC or Purchaser, as applicable, has assumed
pursuant this Agreement; provided, however, that neither Seller nor Purchaser
(nor any of their respective Subsidiaries) shall be obligated to pay any
consideration or grant any concession or agree to any material amendment to
any such Timberlands Contracts in order to obtain any such release. Subject to
the immediately preceding sentence, the requesting Party shall pay all
reasonable out of pocket costs by the Purchaser, and all costs of Seller,
incurred in obtaining any such release, including all reasonable attorneys
fees.

__41.  _Further Assurances_. From time to time following the Closing Date, as
and when requested by any Party hereto and at such Partys expense, any other
Party shall execute and deliver, or cause to be executed and delivered, all
such documents and instruments and shall take, or cause to be taken, all such
further or other actions as such requesting party may reasonably deem
necessary or desirable to evidence and effectuate the Transactions
contemplated by this Agreement; provided that none of the foregoing shall
expand or increase or diminish or decrease any representations, warranties or
other liabilities of the requested Party expressly provided under this
Agreement, nor further decrease or increase any limitations, restrictions or
disclaimers for the benefit of the requested Party, as expressly provided
under this Agreement. __

 

 __42. _Post-Closing Deeds_. The Parties acknowledge that certain title clean-
up efforts and activities may be necessary after consummation of the
Transactions to correct, supplement, and provide missing or incomplete legal
descriptions in the Deeds. The Parties agree as follows: __

 



82 42.1. _New Legal Descriptions_. Purchaser will have a period of twelve (12)
months after the Closing (the "Clean-Up Period") within which to:

(a) Identify (i) scriveners errors in the legal descriptions which were
attached to the Deeds delivered by Seller at the Closing, (ii) circumstances
where such legal descriptions contain text previously determined to be
illegible (but now the Purchaser has access to a legible version), or (iii)
circumstances where legal descriptions could not be tied to any currently
existing boundaries or natural features (but now Purchaser has access to a
legal that can be tied to existing boundaries or natural features), and draft
corrected legal descriptions and prepare quitclaim deeds for execution by the
appropriate Seller.

(b) Locate surveys and/or plats (provided such surveys and/or plats were
prepared by a licensed surveyor in accordance with applicable ALTA/ACSM
standards for land surveys or are otherwise mutually acceptable to Purchaser
and Seller), or prepare new surveys (provided such new surveys are prepared
by a licensed surveyor in accordance with the applicable ALTA/ACSM standards
for land surveys and are certified to the appropriate Seller), which more
clearly describe and/or delineate portions of Timberlands conveyed or intended
to be conveyed (depicted within those certain GIS shape files made available
to Purchaser on October 22, 2013 and identified as "AL-GA Timberland Shapefile
Acres 2013-10-17.pdf", "SC Timberland Shapefile Acres 2013-10-22.pdf", "VA
Timberland Shapefile Acres 2013-10-17.pdf" and "WV Timberland Shapefile Acres
2013-10-22.pdf" on _Exhibit 22_ ) and attached hereto by the Deeds, prepare
legal descriptions based on such plats or surveys and prepare quitclaim deeds
for execution by the appropriate Seller; and

(c) Prepare legal descriptions which describe portions of the
Timberlands depicted on the GIS shape files described in Section 42.1(b) as
to which no legal description was included within any Deed, and quitclaim
deeds for execution by the appropriate Seller.

 

42.2. _Instruments of Conveyance_. Seller agrees promptly to execute and
deliver to Purchaser all of the deeds contemplated by Section 42.1, subject
to Sellers reasonable review and approval of the form of the deeds and the
legal descriptions attached to such deeds (and at Sellers request, Purchaser
agrees to provide all surveys, legal descriptions and other title property
materials in Purchasers possession if Seller wishes to review the same). If a
dispute arises with respect to either the right of Purchaser to request any
such deed, the form of any proposed deed or the accuracy of any proposed
legal description, then such dispute will be resolved in accordance with the
provisions of Section 35 herein. For the avoidance of doubt, all deeds shall
be quitclaim deeds given without additional consideration and without warranty
or representation of any kind by Seller.

42.3. _Recordation Fees and Transfer Taxes and All Other Expenses_. Purchaser
will be solely responsible for preparation and recording of all of the deeds
contemplated by Section 42.1 following delivery by Seller. The Purchaser and
Seller will each pay one-half of all Transfer Taxes (if any) which may be
payable in connection with the recordation of such deeds, it being
acknowledged and agreed that all deeds shall be given without additional
consideration.

 



83 42.4. _Further Cooperation_. Each Party agrees to reasonably cooperate in good
faith with the other Parties to facilitate the investigation and research
which may be reasonably necessary in connection with the preparation and
execution of the legal descriptions contemplated by Section 43.1 hereof, which
cooperation will include, without limitation, making then-current employees
of such Party with relevant knowledge and/or experience reasonably available
and to provide the other Parties with access to such Partys relevant records
supporting documentation and files, to the extent then in such Parties
possession, to the extent related to the subject matter of this Section 42\.
Except for sharing of Transfer Taxes (if any) as provided in Section 42.3,
Purchaser shall be solely responsible for all costs, fees and expenses
incurred in connection with Sections 42.1 and 42.2 and this Section 42.4
(other than Sellers costs incurred in the review of any requested title
materials and the quitclaim deeds), and shall promptly reimburse Seller for
all copying costs and other expenses incurred by Seller in Purchasers review
of Sellers records.

42.5.  _Limitations_. For the avoidance of doubt, none of the provisions of
this Section 42 shall modify, waive or otherwise affect (a)the closing of any
of the Transactions, or (b) any of the provisions of Section 7, including
without limitation any waiver of any Purchasers Title Objections or any
Disputed Matters resolved pursuant to Section 35, and Purchaser shall not have
the right to make any claim under or with respect to any of the Deeds based on
any matters referred to or contemplated in this Section 42, including the
quitclaim deeds.

43\. _Guaranty_ _._ __

 

(a) PC Parent, as primary obligor and not merely a surety, hereby absolutely,
unconditionally and irrevocably guarantees the following payment obligations
of the Purchaser arising under this Agreement (collectively, the "Guaranteed
Obligations"):

(i) The obligation to pay the Purchase Price at Closing;

(ii) The indemnification obligations, including for breaches
of representations and warranties contained in Section 14(b), and for Losses
suffered as a result of or in connection any Purchasers fraud or knowing,
willful or intentional misstatements or breaches;

 

(iii) The payment of taxes, expenses and prorations pursuant to Section 18;
and

 

(iv) PCLs obligation to make the capital contributions to MWV-EED pursuant to
Sections 6(c)(viii) and (ix).

 



84 (b) PC Parent hereby waives promptness, diligence, notice of acceptance of the
guaranty set forth in this Section 43 (the "Guaranty") and of the Guaranteed
Obligations, presentment, demand for payment, notice of non-performance,
default, dishonor and protest, notice of any Guaranteed Obligations incurred,
all defenses which may be available by virtue of any valuation, stay,
moratorium law or other similar law now or hereafter in effect, and all
suretyship defenses. The liability of PC Parent hereunder shall not be
affected by (i) the release or discharge of the Purchaser in any creditors,
receivership, bankruptcy, or other proceedings, (ii) the impairment,
limitation, or modification of the liability of the Purchaser in bankruptcy,
(iii) any disability or other defense of the Purchaser, (iv) the cessation
from any cause whatsoever of the liability of the Purchaser, (v) the existence
of any claim, set off or other right that PC Parent may have at any time
against MWV, CDLM LLC or CDLM Inc., whether in connection with any Guaranteed
Obligation or otherwise, (vi) the failure or delay on the part of MWV to
assert any claim or demand or to enforce any right or remedy against the
Purchaser; (vii) any change in the time, place or manner of payment of any of
the Guaranteed Obligations or any waiver, compromise, consolidation or other
amendment or modification of any of the terms or conditions of this Agreement;
(viii) any change in the corporate existence, structure or ownership of PC
Parent or the Purchaser; or (ix) the adequacy of any other means MWV may have
of obtaining payment related to any of the Guaranteed Obligations. To the
fullest extent permitted by law, PC Parent hereby irrevocably and expressly
waives any and all rights or defenses arising by reason of any law which
would otherwise require any election of remedies by MWV. MWV shall not have
any obligation first to exhaust or pursue its remedies against the Purchaser
before having the right to proceed against PC Parent hereunder.

(c) The Guaranty is a guarantee of payment and not of collectability. The
Guaranty is a continuing one and shall remain in full force and effect until
the payment and satisfaction in full of all the Guaranteed Obligations. If at
any time payment of any of the Guaranteed Obligations is rescinded or must be
otherwise restored or returned by Seller upon the insolvency, bankruptcy or
reorganization of PC Parent, any of its Subsidiaries or otherwise, PC Parents
obligations hereunder with respect to such payment shall be reinstated upon
such restoration or return being made by Seller, all as though such
payment had not been made. PC Parent acknowledges that it will receive
substantial direct and indirect benefits from the Transactions. Subject to the
restrictions on assignment in Section 43(d) the Guaranty shall bind and shall
inure to the benefit of the Parties respective successors and assigns.

(d) PC Parent may not assign any right or delegate any obligation under
this Section 43 without the express prior written consent of Seller, which
consent shall not be unreasonably withheld; provided, however, that assignment
or delegation by PC Parent to one or more of its controlled affiliates is
permissible, so long as PC Parent remains obligated under the Guaranty to
Seller. For purposes of this Section 43(d), an entity is a "controlled
affiliate" of PC Parent if PC Parent owns, directly or indirectly, more than
fifty percent (50%) of the voting securities of, or other ownership interest
in, such entity. The foregoing notwithstanding, PC Parent shall cause any
entity that merges or consolidates with or into PC Parent, or that acquires
all or substantially all of the assets of PC Parent, to assume all
liabilities and obligations of PC Parent under the Guaranty.

 



85 (e) The Guaranty may not be changed, modified, discharged or terminated in any
manner other than by an agreement in writing signed by Seller. Any waiver by
Seller, or the giving of any consent or the granting of any indulgences or
extensions of time to the Purchaser, to all of which PC Parent hereby
consents, may be done without notice to PC Parent and without releasing the
obligations of PC Parent hereunder.

(f) Without limiting the foregoing, PC Parent shall not have the right
hereunder to, and waives and relinquishes any right which it might otherwise
have, to offset or credit against any Guaranteed Obligations, the amount of
any Losses or any other obligation, claim, payment or other liability of
Seller or any Affiliates to Purchaser under this Agreement or otherwise.

JV1 and (ii) all of the (A) outstanding membership interests of the JV2

on  _Exhibit A-7_ (which shall be deemed to have been contributed to the

Plums initial Class A and Class B cash capital contributions to the Company

capital contributions of the Class B Members hereinafter referred to as the "
_Initial Class B Capital Contributions_ ," and with the Initial Class A
Capital Contributions and the Initial Class B Capital Contributions
hereinafter collectively referred to as the " _Initial Capital Contributions_
").

Section 3.2 _Additional Capital Contributions_.

(a) _No Required Capital Contributions_. Except as otherwise set forth in this
Agreement, including this Article 3, no Member shall be required to make any
Additional Capital Contributions to the capital of the Company, nor shall any
Member be permitted to make any Additional Capital Contributions.

 

(b) _Additional Class A Capital Contributions_.

 

(i) Throughout the course of a Fiscal Year and at such times specified by the
Managing Member pursuant to Section 3.2(b)(ii), the Class A Members may be
requested to make Additional Capital Contributions with respect to a JV1
Project (" _Additional Class A Capital Contributions_") in cash to the
Company and such Additional Class A Capital Contributions shall be in
accordance with their Class A Percentage Interests; _provided_ that the Class
A Members shall be required to make all Additional Class A Capital
Contributions requested by the Managing Member with respect to Company
Administrative Expenses pursuant to Section 4.5(c) in accordance with their
respective Class A Percentage Interests.

 



-20- (ii) In the event the Managing Member determines to request that the Class A
Members make an Additional Capital Contribution to the Company pursuant to
Section 3.2(b)(i), the Managing Member shall issue a notice to all of the
Class A Members setting forth the amount of the Additional Capital
Contribution requested from each Class A Member (the " _Class A Requested
Amount_ "). For the avoidance of doubt, it is understood that all Additional
Capital Contributions received by the Company from a Class A Member pursuant
to this Section 3.2(b) shall be allocated solely to the business and
operations of JV1.

(c) _Additional Class B Capital Contributions_.

 

(i) Throughout the course of a Fiscal Year and at such times specified by the
Managing Member pursuant to Section 3.2(c)(ii), the Class B Members shall
make Additional Capital Contributions with respect to an approved JV2 Project
or with respect to forestry operations related to the JV2 Assets ("
_Additional Class B Capital Contributions_ ") in cash to the Company to the
extent such Capital Contributions (A) constitute Plan Designated Project
Contributions and do not result in any Performance Threshold not being met,
(B) do not exceed the total expenses set forth in _Exhibit A-3_ with respect
to the corresponding Fiscal Year or (C) were previously approved by the JV2
Board pursuant to Section 4.8(c), and such Additional Capital Contributions
shall be in accordance with their respective Class B Percentage Interests (in
each case, a " _Pre-Approved Class B Additional Capital Contribution_ ").

(ii) In the event the Class B Members are required to make an Additional
Capital Contribution that qualifies as a Pre-Approved Class B Additional
Capital Contribution to the Company pursuant to Section 3.2(c)(i), the
Managing Member shall issue a notice to all of the Class B Members (the "
_Class B Contribution Notice_ ") setting forth the amount of the Additional
Capital Contribution required from each Class B Member (the " _Class B
Requested Amount_ "). Within ten (10) Business Days following the date of the
delivery of a Class B Contribution Notice (the " _Class B Contribution
Deadline_ "), each Class B Member shall pay to the Company the Class B
Members Class B Requested Amount in cash; _provided_ , _however_ , with
respect to any particular Fiscal Year, unless otherwise expressly set forth
in the applicable JV2 Annual Plan or as otherwise agreed to by the Class B
Members, (A) on or before January 2 of the applicable calendar year, the Class
B Requested Amounts shall not exceed sixty percent (60%) of the Pre-Approved
Class B Additional Capital Contribution and (B) on or before July 1 of the
applicable calendar year, the Class B Requested Amounts shall not exceed the
remaining portion of the Pre-Approved Class B Additional Capital Contribution
that had not been previously requested by the Managing Member pursuant to
subclause (A).

 

(iii) Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event that during a Fiscal Year
the Managing Member requests that a Class B Member make an Additional Capital
Contribution that does not qualify as a Pre-Approved Class B Additional
Capital Contribution (a " _Non-Pre-Approved Class B Additional Capital
Contribution_ "), such Class B Member, in its sole discretion, may,
within ten (10) Business Days of receiving such request, elect to make all or
a portion of the Non-Pre-Approved Class B Additional Capital Contribution. If
the Class B Member elects to make all or a portion of the Non-Pre-Approved
Class B Additional Capital Contribution, the contributing Class B Members
Percentage Interests with respect to the Class B Subordinated Preferred
Membership Interests shall be adjusted to equal a fraction, the numerator of
which is the aggregate amount of the Non-Pre-Approved Class B Additional
Capital

 



-21-  Contribution made by the Class B Member and the denominator of which is the
aggregate amount of all Non-Pre-Approved Class B Additional Capital
Contributions made by any Class B Member.

 

(iv) To the extent the Managing Member reasonably determines that it is in the
best interests of a particular JV2 Project to accelerate certain expenditures
with respect to the applicable JV2 Project to the Calendar Year immediately
preceding the Calendar Year in which the expenditures were originally
contemplated under the applicable JV2 Strategic Plan then in effect, subject
to the limitations set forth in the last sentence of this Section 3.2(c)(iv),
the Managing Member may give notice (" _Accelerated Expense Notice_ ") to the
Class B Members specifying (A) the amount of such capital expenditures (the "
_Accelerated Expense_ "), (B) the reasons for the determination of the
Managing Member to so accelerate such expenditures, and (C) a reasonable
description of the Accelerated Expense including designation of the line item
in the JV2 Strategic Plan to which the Accelerated Expense relates. The
parties acknowledge and agree that Accelerated Expense Notices are intended to
accommodate expenses occurring in advance of projections as a result of
accelerated sales velocity or accelerated entitlement activities and are not
intended to apply to real estate taxes or other periodic expenses tied to a
particular Calendar Year. Notwithstanding anything set forth in this Section
3.2(c)(iv) to the contrary, the Managing Member may give an Accelerated
Expense Notice only once with respect to any JV2 Project (which notice must be
given on or before November 1 of the current Calendar Year) with Accelerated
Expenses set forth in such Accelerated Expense Notice not to exceed one
hundred percent (100%) of (x) the applicable line item or line items of Total
Expenses for said JV2 Project for the originally budgeted Calendar Year, and
(y) the Total Expenses for said JV2 Project for the originally budgeted
Calendar Year.

(v) For the avoidance of doubt, it is understood that all Additional Capital
Contributions received by the Company from a Class B Member pursuant to this
Section 3.2(c) shall be allocated solely to the prospective business and
operations of the JV2 Assets.

 

(d) _Failure to Make Capital Contributions by a Class A Member_.

 

(i) In the event that any Class A Member elects not to contribute the Class A
Members Requested Amount under Section 3.2(b) (a " _Non-Contributing Class
A Member_"), then as its and the Companys exclusive remedy (other than with
respect to Requested Amounts that relate to Company Administrative Expenses
pursuant to Section 4.5(c)), the other Class A Member (the " _Contributing
Class A Member_") shall have the right, but not the obligation, to make a
Capital Contribution to the Company in an amount equal to all or a portion of
the Additional Class A Capital Contribution which the Non-Contributing Class
A Member elected not to make (the " _Class A Covering Contribution_ "), and to
cause dilution of the Non-Contributing Class A Members Membership Interest in
accordance with the provisions of Section 3.2(d)(ii). Such right shall be
exercised by written notice to the Non-Contributing Class A Member of the
amount being contributed by the Contributing Class A Member.

 

(ii) If, with respect to any Additional Class A Capital Contribution with
respect to a JV1 Project, there is a Non-Contributing Class A Member, then
the Percentage Interests of the Class A Members shall be adjusted such that
the Class A Percentage Interests of the Contributing Class A Member shall be
increased to equal a fraction, the numerator of which 

 



-22-  is the aggregate Class A Capital Contributions of the Contributing Class A
Member (including the Additional Class A Capital Contribution) and the
denominator of which is the aggregate Class A Capital Contribution of all
Class A Members (and the Non-Contributing Class A Members Class A Percentage
Interests shall be reduced accordingly). If the Contributing Class A Member
elects to make the Class A Covering Contribution, the Class A Percentage
Interests of the Contributing Class A Member shall be further increased to
equal a fraction, the numerator of which is the aggregate Class A Capital
Contributions of the Contributing Class A Member (including the Class A
Covering Contribution) and the denominator of which is the aggregate Class A
Capital Contributions of all Class A Members (and the Non-Contributing Class A
Members Class A Percentage Interests shall be reduced accordingly).

(iii) The Capital Contributions and Class A Percentage Interests set forth
next to each Class A Members name on _Exhibit A_ shall be updated to reflect
any Additional Capital Contributions or Class A Covering Contributions made
pursuant to this Section 3.2(d).

 

(e) _Failure to Make Capital Contributions by a Class B Member_.

 

(i) In the event that any Class B Member shall fail to contribute the Members
Requested Amount under Section 3.2(c)(ii) as of the applicable Class B
Contribution Deadline (a " _Non-Contributing Class B Member_ "), then, as to
each such default, the other Class B Member (the " _Contributing Class B
Member_ ") shall have the right, but not the obligation, to elect to (x) make
a Capital Contribution (the " _Class B Default Contribution_ ") to the Company
in an amount equal to all or a portion of the Additional Capital Contribution
that the Non-Contributing Class B Member failed to make (the " _Class B
Deficiency Amount_ ") in exchange for Class B Senior Preferred Membership
Interests in accordance with the provisions of Section 3.2(c)(iii), or (y)
advance directly to the Company the Class B Deficiency Amount as a loan to the
Company as provided in Section 3.2(e)(iii). Such right shall be exercised by
written notice to the Non-Contributing Class B Member of the amount being
contributed by the Contributing Class B Member.

 

(ii) If, with respect to any Additional Capital Contribution, there is a Non-
Contributing Class B Member after the expiration of the applicable Class B
Contribution Deadline, then the Class B Percentage Interests of the Class B
Members shall be adjusted, effective as of the expiration of said Class B
Contribution Deadline, such that the Class B Percentage Interests of
the Contributing Class B Member shall be increased to equal a fraction, the
numerator of which is the aggregate Class B Capital Contributions of the
Contributing Class B Member (including the Additional Class B Capital
Contribution, but excluding any Additional Class B Capital Contributions for
which a Class B Member received Class B Senior Preferred Membership Interests
or Class B Subordinated Membership Interests) and the denominator of which is
the aggregate Class B Capital Contribution of all Class B Members (excluding
any Additional Class B Capital Contributions for which a Class B Member
received Class B Senior Preferred Membership Interests or Class B Subordinated
Preferred Membership Interests), and the Non-Contributing Class B Members
Percentage Interests shall be reduced accordingly).

(iii) If the Contributing Class B Member elects to make a loan to
the Company, the Class B Senior Preferred Amount so advanced shall be
directly advanced to the

 



-23-  Company as a loan (a " _Class B Deficit Loan_ ") due and payable upon demand
and bearing interest at the rate equal to eight (8) percentage points above
the rate of interest publicly announced by [] from time to time as its
"Prime Rate" of interest (the " _Prime Rate_ "). All such Class B Deficit
Loans shall be paid in full in accordance with Section 8.1, which provides
that any payments on a Class B Deficit Loan shall be credited first to any
interest then due on the Class B Deficit Loan with the balance of such
payments to be credited against the outstanding principal balance of such
Class B Deficit Loan. Class B Deficit Loans, and any other loans or any
guarantees from a Member to or for the benefit of the Company or to JV1 made
in accordance with the terms and conditions of this Agreement, do not
constitute equity or capital contributions of said Member to the Company or
to JV1, as the case may be.

(iv) If the Contributing Class B Member elects to make the Class B Default
Contribution, the Contributing Class B Members Percentage Interests with
respect to the Class B Senior Preferred Membership Interests shall be adjusted
to equal a fraction, the numerator of which is the aggregate amount of the
Class B Deficiency Amount so contributed by the Contributing Class B Member
(the " _Class B Senior Preferred Amount_ ") and the denominator of which is
the aggregate amount of all Class B Senior Preferred Amounts made by any
Class B Member.

(v) The Capital Contributions and Class B Percentage Interests set forth next
to each Class B Members name on  _Exhibit A_ shall be updated to reflect
any Additional Capital Contributions or Class B Default Contributions made
pursuant to this Section 3.2(e).

 

Section 3.3 _Capital Accounts_. A separate Capital Account shall be
established and maintained for each Member with respect to the Class A
Membership Interests and the Class B Membership Interests in accordance with
Section 704(b) of the Code and the Treasury Regulations promulgated thereunder
as follows:

 

(a) Each Members Capital Account with respect to each Class of Membership
Interests will be increased by:

 

(i) Any Capital Contributions made by such Member with respect to such Class;

 

(ii) Allocations to such Member of JV1 Profits or JV2 Profits (or items of
income or gain) pursuant to Section 7.1, as the case may be, and any items in
the nature of income or gain that are specially allocated to such Member
pursuant to Section 7.2 with respect to such class; and

 

(iii) Company liabilities assumed by such Member as provided in Treasury
Regulations Section 1.704-1(b)(2)(iv)(c)(1).

 

(b) Each Members Capital Account with respect to each Class of Membership
Interests will be decreased by:

 

(i) The amount of cash distributions made to such Member by the Company in
respect to such Members Membership Interests in such class; 

 



-24- (ii) The Book Value of any asset distributed to such Member by the Company in
respect of such Members Membership Interests (net of any liabilities that
are secured by such property that such Member is considered to assume or take
subject to Section 752 of the Code);

 

(iii) Allocations to such Member of JV1 Losses or JV2 Losses (or items of loss
or deduction) pursuant to Section 7.1, as the case may be, and any items in
the nature of loss or deduction that are specially allocated to such Member
pursuant to Section 7.2 with respect to such class; and

 

(iv) Such Members liabilities assumed by the Company as provided in Treasury
Regulations Section 1.704-1(b)(2)(iv)(c)(2) with respect to such class.

(c) A Capital Account (the " _Aggregate Capital Account_ ") shall also be
established and maintained with respect to each Member that consists of the
sum of (i) each such Members Capital Account in respect of the Class A
Membership Interests and Class B Membership Interests and (ii) any items of
increase or decrease (calculated in the same manner as described above in
Sections 3.3(a) and (b)) that are not attributable to a particular class.

(d) The foregoing provisions and other provisions of this Agreement relating
to the maintenance of Capital Accounts are intended to comply with Treasury
Regulations Section 1.704-1(b)(2)(iv) and shall be interpreted and applied in
a manner consistent with such Treasury Regulations. In the event of a
Transfer of all or a part of a Members Membership Interests, the Capital
Account of the Transferor shall become the Capital Account of the Transferee
to the extent it is attributable to the transferred Membership Interests in
accordance with Treasury Regulations Section l.704-l(b)(2)(iv)(l).

(e) _Exhibit A_ sets forth each Members Capital Account balances
immediately following the consummation of the Transaction with respect to
Class A Membership Interest, Class B Membership Interest and in the aggregate.

 

(f) Except as otherwise required in the Act, no Member shall have any
liability to restore all or any portion of a deficit balance in such Members
Capital Accounts.

(g) No interest shall be paid on Capital Contributions or on the balance in a
Members Capital Accounts.

(h) Except as otherwise provided in this Agreement, no Member shall (i) have
the right to withdraw any capital without the prior written consent of the
other Member or (ii) have the right to receive property other than cash in
payment of distributions in redemption of such Members Capital Accounts.

 

Section 3.4 _Post-Closing Payments Relating to Project Indebtedness and
Prepaid Expenses_. The Members acknowledge and agree that (i) the Initial
Capital Contributions of the Members are based upon valuations of the JV1
Projects and the JV2 Projects set forth in _Exhibits A-1 (JV1)_ and _A-1
(JV2)_ , respectively, and (ii) said valuations are based upon the
presumption that, as of the date of contribution by CDLM of the JV1 Projects
and the JV2 Projects and as of the date hereof, there is no Indebtedness
related to the Company, JV1, the Subsidiaries of JV1,

 



-25-  the JV2 Project Subsidiaries, the JV1 Projects or the JV2 Projects except as
set forth on _Exhibit A-5_. Within ten (10) Business Days of the date hereof,
the Managing Member shall provide each Member with a list of (a) all
outstanding Indebtedness as of the date hereof that relates to the Company,
JV1, the Subsidiaries of JV1, the JV2 Project Subsidiaries, the JV1 Projects
or the JV2 Projects, other than Indebtedness set forth on _Exhibit A-5_ ("
_Project Indebtedness_ ") and (b) expenses of any of the JV1 Projects or JV2
Projects that relate to the period beginning after the date hereof and that
have been paid by CDLM or one of its Affiliates on or prior to the date
hereof (" _Prepaid Expenses_ "). To the extent that (x) the Adjustment Amount
is a positive amount, CDLM shall contribute an amount of cash to the Company
equal to such positive amount (it being understood that such contribution
shall not qualify as a Class A Capital Contribution or a Class B Capital
Contribution) and (y) the Adjustment Amount is a negative amount, the Company
shall pay CDLM an amount in cash equal to the absolute value of such negative
amount.

Section 4.5 _Management Fees; Reimbursement of Expenses_.

(i) During the term of this Agreement and in compensation for the performance
and management of the JV1 Projects in accordance with Section 4.2, the
Managing Member will receive from the Company solely out of the JV1 Assets a
management fee consisting of (i) an annual management fee that is paid semi-
annually in advance, equal to (A) the anticipated aggregate amount of
overhead expenses to be incurred by the Managing Member during the upcoming
Calendar Year (other than the Company Administrative Expenses), less (B)
expenses associated with the management of development projects other than the
JV1 Projects and the JV2 Projects, less (C) the amount of the JV2 Annual Base
Management Fee (the " _JV1 Annual Base Management Fee_ ") and (ii) an
incentive management fee that is paid in accordance with the terms of the Plan
and that is more fully described in _Exhibit A-4-B (JV1)_ attached

 



-27-  hereto (the " _JV1 Incentive Management Fee_ ", and together with the JV1
Annual Base Management Fee, the " _JV1 Management Fee_ "). To the extent that
the Closing occurs on or before December 31, 2013, the JV1 Annual Base
Management Fee for the period between the date hereof and December 31, 2013
shall be an amount equal to (x) the anticipated aggregate amount of overhead
expenses to be incurred by the Managing Member, less (y) expenses associated
with the management of development projects other than the JV1 Projects and

shall not be deemed to constitute distributions to the Managing Member of
Profit, Loss, or capital of the Company.

(ii) The Managing Member shall compute each installment of the JV1 Base
Management Fee within five (5) days after the end of each semi-annual payment
period. A copy of the computations made by the Managing Member to calculate
such installment shall thereafter promptly be delivered to each of the Class

Management Fee shown therein shall be due and payable no later than the date
which is five (5) Business Days after the date of delivery to the Class A
Members. Any Class A Member shall have the right, to the extent that such
Class A Member is alleging that there was a mathematical error in the
calculation underlying the proposed JV1 Base Management Fee, to contest the
amount of the JV1 Base Management Fee by notice to the Managing Member and
the other Class A Members. Upon a JV1 Payment becoming due under the terms of
the Plan, within five (5) days, MWV shall (A) compute the aggregate amount of
such JV1 Payment in accordance with the terms of the Plan and (B) provide the
Class A Members with a copy of such computations that have been approved by
the Compensation and Organization Development Committee of the MWV board of
directors and certified on behalf of the administrator of the Plan. The JV1
Incentive Management Fee related to such JV1 Payment shall be due and payable
no later than the date which is fifteen (15) days after the date of delivery
of such computations to the Class A Members; _provided_ that, prior to a
Class A Member Transferring all of its Class A Membership Interests to a third
party in accordance with the terms of this Agreement, the Managing Member
shall request, in accordance with Section 3.2(b), that such Class A Member
pay to the Managing Member its pro rata portion (in accordance with its Class
A Percentage Interests) of any JV1 Payments that have been earned or vested
during the then-current performance period based on actual sales or
liquidations that have occurred on or prior to the proposed Transfer date; it
being understood that such Class A Member shall not be required to pay such
amount prior to Transferring all of its Class A Membership Interests to a
third party. Any Class A Member shall have the right, to the extent that such
Class A Member is alleging that there was a mathematical error in the
calculation underlying the proposed JV1 Incentive Management Fee, to contest
the amount of the JV1 Incentive Management Fee by notice to MWV and the other
Class A Members.

(b) _JV2 Management Fee_.

(i) During the term of this Agreement and in compensation for the performance
of the JV2 Management Obligations, the Managing Member will receive from the
Company solely out of the JV2 Assets a management fee consisting of (i) an

the net asset value of the JV2 

 



-28-  Assets held by JV2 or any of its Subsidiaries as of December 31 of the
immediately preceding Calendar Year as more fully described in _Exhibit A-4-A_
(the " _JV2 Annual Base Management Fee_ ") and (ii) an incentive management
fee that is paid in accordance with the terms of the Plan and that is more
fully described in _Exhibit A-4-B (JV2)_ (the " _JV2 Incentive Management
Fee_ ", and together with the JV2 Annual Base Management Fee, the " _JV2
Management Fee_ "). To the extent that the Closing occurs on or before
December 31, 2013, the JV2 Annual Base Management Fee for the period between
the date hereof and December 31, 2013 shall be an amount equal to (x) the
aggregate amount of the JV2 Project values set forth on Exhibit A-1(JV2)
multiplied by (y) the Fee Percentage for Calendar Year 2014 set forth on
_Exhibit A-4-A_ multiplied by (z) a fraction, the numerator of which is the
number of calendar days from the date hereof (inclusive) to December 31, 2013
(inclusive) and the denominator of which is 365 (the " _Stub 2013 JV2 Base
Management Fee_ "). The Stub 2013 JV2 Base Management Fee shall be due and
payable on the date hereof and the payment of the JV2 Management Fee shall be
treated as an expense of the Company and shall not be deemed to constitute
distributions to the Managing Member of Profit, Loss, or capital of the
Company.

(ii) The Managing Member shall compute each installment of the JV2 Base
Management Fee within five (5) days after each semi-annual payment period. A
copy of the computations made by the Managing Member to calculate such
installment shall thereafter. promptly be delivered to the JV2 Board and,
upon such delivery, payment of such installment of the JV2 Base Management Fee
shown therein shall be due and payable no later than the date which is five
(5) Business Days after the date of delivery to the JV2 Board. Any Class B
Member shall have the right, to the extent that such Class B Member is
alleging that there was a mathematical error in the calculation underlying the
proposed JV2 Base Management Fee, to contest the amount of the JV2
Base Management Fee by notice to the Managing Member and the other Class B
Members. Upon a JV2 Payment becoming due under the terms of the Plan, within
five (5) days, MWV shall (A) compute the aggregate amount of such JV2 Payment
in accordance with the terms of the Plan and (B) provide the Class B Members
with a copy of such computations that have been approved by the Compensation
and Organization Development Committee of the MWV board of directors and
certified on behalf of the administrator of the Plan. The JV2 Incentive
Management Fee related to such JV2 Payment shall be due and payable no later
than the date which is fifteen (15) days after the date of delivery of such
computations to the Class B Members; provided that, prior to a Class B Member
Transferring all of its Class B Membership Interests to a third party in
accordance with the terms of this Agreement, such Class B Member shall be
required to pay to the Managing Member its pro rata portion (in accordance
with its Class B Percentage Interests) of any JV2 Payments that have been
earned or vested during the then-current performance period based on actual
sales or liquidations that have occurred on or prior to the proposed Transfer
date. Any Class B Member shall have the right, to the extent that such Class
B Member is alleging that there was a mathematical error in the calculation
underlying the proposed JV2 Incentive Management Fee, to contest the amount of
the JV2 Incentive Management Fee by notice to MWV and the other Class B
Members.

(c) _Company Administrative Expenses_. The Members acknowledge and agree
that, during the Term, the Company will incur certain third-party ordinary
course, administrative costs and expenses on behalf of the Company that do not
directly relate to the day-to-day operations of the JV1 Projects or the JV2
Projects, including with respect to audit matters, tax preparation and
planning matters (including as set forth in Sections 10.2 and 10.3),

 



-29-  and insurance coverages described in Sections 4.10 and 13.6 (collectively,
the " _Company Administrative Expenses_ "). Not less than sixty (60) days
prior to the commencement of each Calendar Year, the Managing Member shall
prepare and present the members of the JV1 Board and the JV2 Board with a
budget for each of the Company Administrative Expenses that the Managing

Year. The Managing Member may call for Additional Capital Contributions to
cover the Company Administrative Expenses with (i) half of such Additional
Capital Contributions to be contributed by the Class A Members in accordance
with their Class A Percentage Interests as Class A Additional Capital
Contributions (it being understood that, notwithstanding anything to the
contrary in Section 3.2(b), each Class A Member shall be required to
make such Class A Additional Capital Contributions in accordance with its
respective Class A Percentage Interests) and (ii) half of such Additional
Capital Contributions to be contributed by the Class B Members in accordance
with their Class B Percentage Interests as Pre-Approved Class B Capital
Contributions. The Managing Member may, in that capacity, advance funds to the
Company for the payment of any Company Administrative Expenses, pending
reimbursement from said Additional Capital Contributions. The Managing Member
shall promptly provide MWV and Plum with a written notice that sets forth the
nature and amount of the Company Administrative Expenses for which the
Managing Member provided such advancement. The reimbursement of the Managing
Member for any advanced Approved Administrative Expenses shall not be deemed
to constitute distributions to the Managing Member of Profit, Loss, or capital
of the Company.

JV2 Board does not approve either the Proposed JV2 Annual Plan or an
Alternative JV2 Annual Plan at the Annual Planning Meeting, (x) if the
Proposed JV2 Annual Plan meets all of the Performance Thresholds in the JV2
Strategic Plan for the corresponding JV2 Project and does not contemplate any
action requiring a Class B Major Decision, then the Proposed JV2 Annual Plan
shall automatically be deemed to have been validly approved by the JV2 Board,
or (y) if the Proposed JV2 Annual Plan does not meet one or more of the
Performance Thresholds, or requires a Class B Major Decision for
implementation, then MWV and Plum shall engage in good faith negotiations in
accordance with Section 14.2(c) to mutually approve a JV2 Annual Plan with
respect to the applicable JV2 Project and, if MWV and Plum are not able to
resolve their dispute in their respective sole discretion within the Internal
Discussion Timeframes set forth in Section 14.2, then either MWV or Plum may
initiate, or cause the initiation of, the buy/sell procedure set forth in
Section 14.1 solely with respect to the applicable JV2 Project; it being
understood that, except with respect to a determination of whether the

Decision, the initiation of the buy/sell procedures set forth in Section 14.1
is not subject to, and does not require MWV and Plum to undertake, the
Arbitration procedures set forth in Section 14.2(d). The parties acknowledge
and agree that (x) Carryover Revenues, if any, shall be taken into account
when determining whether a JV2 Project met any revenue-related Performance
Thresholds during the current Calendar Year, and (y) Accelerated Expenses,

performance of a JV2 Project did not meet one or more of the Performance
Thresholds, or (y) the JV2 Board has approved an Alternative JV2 Annual Plan,
then, in each such case, the JV2 Strategic Plan then in effect for the
applicable JV2 Project shall no longer be in effect and MWV and Plum shall
engage in good faith negotiations in accordance with Section 14.2(c) with
respect to the approval of a new JV2 Strategic Plan (an " _Alternative JV2
Strategic Plan_ ") that, upon such approval, shall replace the previous JV2
Strategic Plan with respect to the applicable JV2 Project; _provided_ that if
MWV and Plum are not able to so agree upon and mutually approve a new JV2
Strategic Plan within the Internal Discussion Timeframes in their respective
sole discretion, then either MWV or Plum may initiate, or cause the
initiation of, the buy/sell procedure set forth in Section 14.1 solely with
respect to the applicable JV2 Project, it being understood that the initiation
of the buy/sell procedures set forth in Section 14.1 is not subject to and
does not require the Arbitration process set forth in Section 14.2(d).

(iv) The parties acknowledge and agree that, at all times during the course
of the planning process set forth in this Section 4.8(b), the JV2 Directors
shall discuss with each other and with the Managing Member (and the Managing

proposed by any JV2 Director with respect to any of the Proposed JV2 Annual
Plans, including those based on the existing or projected conditions
(economic, real estate or otherwise) in the markets in which JV2 operates, or

convened meeting and entitled to vote thereon, with each JV2 Director having

Member may take action hereunder relating to a Class B Major Decision
disagreement with respect to this Section 4.8(c)(ix) until one (1)
year following such resignation or removal so long as MWV is diligently and
continuously proceeding in good faith in the identification of such potential
replacement candidates during such one (1)-year period;

 

(x) any modification or amendment to (A) any of the JV2 Strategic Plans or (B)

Company Minimum Gain during any Fiscal Year, each Member shall be specially
allocated items of Company income and gain for such Fiscal Year (and, if
necessary, subsequent Fiscal Years) in an amount equal to such Members share
of the net decrease in Company Minimum Gain, determined in accordance with
Treasury Regulations Section 1.704-2(g). Allocations pursuant to the previous

allocated to each Member pursuant thereto. The items to be so allocated shall

Section 1.704-2(f) and shall be interpreted consistently therewith.

 



-43- (ii) _Member Minimum Gain Chargeback_. Except as otherwise provided in
Treasury Regulations Section 1.704-2(i)(4), if there is a net decrease in
Member Minimum Gain attributable to a Member Nonrecourse Debt during any
Fiscal Year, each Member who has a share of the Member Minimum Gain
attributable to such Member Nonrecourse Debt, determined in accordance with
Treasury Regulations Section 1.704-2(i)(5), shall be specially allocated items
of Company income and gain for such Fiscal Year (and, if necessary, subsequent
Fiscal Years) in an amount equal to the portion of such Members share of the

Member shall be allocated items of Company income or gain in an amount and
manner sufficient to eliminate such Members Adjusted Capital Account Deficit
as quickly as possible to the extent required by the Treasury Regulations;
_provided_ that an allocation pursuant to this Section 7.2(a)(iii) shall be
made only if and to the extent that such Member would have an Adjusted
Capital Account Deficit after all other allocations provided in this Article 7
have been tentatively made as if this Section 7.2(a)(iii) were not in this
Agreement. This Section 7.2(a)(iii) is intended to comply with the "qualified
income offset" requirement set forth in Treasury Regulation Section
1.704-1(b)(2)(ii)(d)(3) and shall be interpreted consistently therewith;

 

(iv) _Gross Income Allocation_. In the event any Member has a deficit Capital
Account at the end of any Fiscal Year that is in excess of the sum of (1) the
amount such Member is obligated to restore, if any, pursuant to any provision
of this Agreement, and (2) the amount such Member is deemed to be obligated to
restore pursuant to the penultimate sentences of Treasury Regulations
Sections 1.704-2(g)(1) and 1.704-2(i)(5), each such Member shall be specially
allocated items of Company income and gain in the amount of such excess as
quickly as possible; _provided_ , that an allocation pursuant to this Section
7.2(a)(iv) shall be made only if and to the extent that a Member would have a
deficit Capital Account in excess of such sum after all other allocations
provided for in this Article 8 have been tentatively made as if Section
7.2(a)(iii) and this Section 7.2(a)(iv) were not in this Agreement;

(v) _Section 754 Adjustments_. To the extent an adjustment to the adjusted
basis for federal income tax purposes of any JV1 Asset or JV2 Asset pursuant
to Section 734(b) or 743(b) of the Code is required, pursuant to Treasury
Regulations Section 1.704-1(b)(2)(iv)(m)(2) or 1.704-1(b)(2)(iv)(m)(4), to be
taken into account in determining Capital Accounts as the result of a
distribution to a Member in complete liquidation of such Members Membership
Interest, the amount of such adjustment to Capital Accounts shall be treated
as an item of gain (if the adjustment increases the basis of the asset) or
loss (if the adjustment decreases such basis) and such gain or loss shall be
specially allocated to the Members in accordance with their Percentage
Interests in the event Treasury Regulations Section 1.704-1(b)(2)(iv)(m)(2)
applies, or to the Member to whom such distribution was made in the event
Treasury Regulations Section 1.704-1(b)(2)(iv)(m)(4) applies;

 



-44- (vi) _Nonrecourse Deductions_. Nonrecourse Deductions shall be allocated to
the Members in accordance with their Percentage Interests;

(vii) _Member Nonrecourse Deductions_. Member Nonrecourse Deductions shall be
allocated to the Member who bears the economic risk of loss with respect to
the Member Nonrecourse Debt to which such Member Nonrecourse Deductions relate
in accordance with Treasury Regulations Section 1.704-2(i); and

 

(viii) _Loss Limitation_. Notwithstanding the foregoing, allocations of Losses
or items of expense or deductions pursuant to Section 7.1 shall not exceed
the maximum amount of Losses that can be allocated without causing any Member
to have an Adjusted Capital Account Deficit at the end of any Fiscal Year (or
increase any existing Adjusted Capital Account Deficit). In the event some
but not all of the Members would have Adjusted Capital Account Deficits (or an
increase in any existing Adjusted Capital Account Deficit) as a consequence of
an allocation of Losses pursuant to Section 7.1, the limitation set forth in
this Section 7.2(a)(viii) shall be applied on a Member-by-Member basis and
Losses not allocable to any Member as a result of such limitation shall be
allocated to the other Members in accordance with the positive balances in
such other Members respective Capital Accounts so as to allocate the maximum
permissible Losses to each Member under Treasury Regulations Section
1.704-1(b)(2)(ii)(d).

 

(b) _Unwind of Special Allocations_. Allocations provided for above in Section
7.2(a) (the " _Regulatory Allocations_ ") are intended to cause allocations
of Company items to be respected under Treasury Regulations, but may not be
consistent with the manner in which the Members intend to allocate Profit and
Loss or make Company distributions. Accordingly, subject to the Regulatory
Allocations, the Company is directed to reallocate items of income, gain,
deduction, loss or credit among the Members so as to offset and eliminate the
effect of the Regulatory Allocations as quickly as possible consistently with
Treasury Regulations, and cause the respective Capital Account balances of the
Members to be in the amounts (or as close thereto as possible) they would have
been if Profit and Loss and items thereof had been allocated without regard
to the Regulatory Allocations.

(c) _Priority_. The allocations under this Section 7.2 shall be made prior to
the allocations under Section 7.1.

Section 7.3 _Tax Allocations_.

 

(a) In accordance with Section 704(c) of the Code and the Treasury Regulations
promulgated thereunder, (i) each item of income, gain, loss, and deduction
with respect to any property contributed to the capital of the Company, shall,
solely for tax purposes, be allocated among the Members so as to take account
of any variation between the adjusted basis of such property for federal
income tax purposes and its initial Book Value using the method specified in
_Exhibit D_ or to the extent not covered by _Exhibit D_, the method selected
by the Managing Member with the approval of the Members; and (ii) in the
event the Book Value of any JV1 Asset or JV2 Asset is adjusted pursuant to
clause (i) of the definition of "Book Value,"

 



-45-  subsequent allocations of income, gain, loss, and deduction with respect to
such asset shall take account of any variation between the adjusted basis of
such asset for federal income tax purposes and its Book Value using the
method set forth in _Exhibit D_ or to the extent not covered by _Exhibit D_,
the method selected by the Managing Member with the approval of the Members.

 

(b) Subject to Section 7.3(a), for federal income tax purposes, all items of
Company income, gain, loss, deduction, basis, amount realized and credit, and
the character and source of such items, shall be allocated among the Members
in the same manner as the corresponding items of income, gain, loss, deduction
or credit are allocated to Capital Accounts in accordance with Section 7.1 or
7.2. The Company shall maintain such books, records and accounts as are
necessary to make such allocations.

(c) Allocations pursuant to this Section 7.3 are solely for income tax
purposes, and shall not affect, or in any way be taken into account in
computing, any Members Capital Account or share of Profits, Losses, other
items of gain, income, loss or deduction, or distributions pursuant to any
provision of this Agreement.

Section 7.4 _Other Allocation Rules_. 

(a) The allocation provisions set forth in this Article 7 and the other
provisions of this Agreement relating to the maintenance of Capital Accounts
are intended to comply with Treasury Regulations Section 1.704-1(b) and shall
be interpreted in a manner consistent therewith.

 

(b) If the Membership Interests of any one or more Members change during a
Fiscal Year, all Company items of income, gain, loss, deduction and credit
shall be allocated among the Members for such Fiscal Year in a reasonable
manner, as determined by the Tax Matters Partner with the consent of the
Members that takes into account the varying Membership Interests of the
Members in the Company during such taxable year in accordance with Section
706 of the Code.

(c) An allocation to a Member of Profits or Losses shall be treated as an
allocation to such Member of each item of income, gain, loss and deduction
that has been taken into account in computing such Profits or Losses.

-49- Section 9.2 _Events Causing Dissolution_. The Company shall be dissolved and
its affairs shall be wound up upon the first to occur of the following
events:

terminate the Company;

(b) the sale, exchange or other disposition or distribution of all or
substantially all of the JV1 Assets and JV2 Assets;

(c) upon the written election of a Member made within sixty (60) days
following the occurrence of an Event of Bankruptcy with respect to the other
Member; or

(d) the entry of a decree of judicial dissolution under Section 18-802 of the
Act. 

Section 9.3 _Notice of Dissolution_. Upon dissolution of the Company, the
Person or Persons (who may be a Member or Members) appointed by the Managing
Member (or by the Members in the absence of an appointment by the Managing
Member) to carry out the winding-up of the Company (the " _Liquidating
Trustee_ ") shall promptly notify the Members of such dissolution.

Section 9.4 _Liquidation_. Upon dissolution of the Company, the Liquidating
Trustee shall immediately commence to wind up the Companys affairs;
_provided_ , _however_ , that a reasonable time shall be allowed for the
orderly liquidation of the assets of the Company and the satisfaction of
liabilities to creditors so as to enable the Members to minimize the normal
losses attendant upon a liquidation. The Members shall continue to share
Profits and Losses during liquidation in the same proportions, as specified in
Article 7, as before liquidation. Each Member shall pay to the Company all
amounts then owing by such Person to the Company. The proceeds of liquidation
shall be distributed, as realized, in the following order and priority:

 

(a) First, to the payment of the expenses of liquidation;

 

(b) Second, to the setting up of any reserves which the Liquidating Trustee
reasonably determines to be necessary or desirable for any contingent or
unforeseen liabilities, expenses or other obligations of the Company;

(c) Third, to the payment of the debts and liabilities of the Company, other
than debts and liabilities to any Member;

(d) Fourth, to the payment of the debts and liabilities of the Company owed
to any Members; and

(e) Fifth, to the Members who have positive Aggregate Capital Account
balances, after taking into account adjustments for all distributions of JV1
Distributable Cash and JV2 Distributable Cash (but not for distributions
pursuant to this Section 9.4(e)) and all allocations of Profits and Losses for
the Companys taxable year during which liquidation occurs, in an amount
sufficient to satisfy such adjusted Aggregate Capital Account balances;
provided that, solely for purposes of this Section 9.4(e), CDLMs Capital
Account with respect to its Class A Membership Interests shall reflect any
necessary adjustments made pursuant to Section 8.1(h)(ii).

 



-50- Unless otherwise directed by both of the Members, the JV1 Assets and the JV2
Assets shall be sold and, in connection with such sale, the Liquidating
Trustee shall arrange for such JV1 Assets and JV2 Assets to be sold as
promptly as possible; _provided_ that such sale is conducted in a business-
like and commercially reasonable manner.

 

Section 9.5 _Liquidating Distributions_.

 

(a) Upon the liquidation of the Company, any liquidating distributions shall
be made in accordance with Section 9.4. Liquidation proceeds shall be paid
within sixty (60) days of the end of the taxable year (or, if later, within
one hundred and twenty (120) days after the date of the liquidation).

 

(b) For purposes of making the liquidating distributions required by Section
9.4, the Liquidating Trustee shall sell all of the JV1 Assets and JV2 Assets
and distribute the proceeds therefrom. With the prior written consent of all
Members, the JV1 Assets and the JV2 Assets may be distributed in kind to the
Members, in which case (i) the Capital Accounts of the Members shall be
adjusted to reflect the amount, if any, of unrealized gain or loss with
respect to such JV1 Assets and JV2 Assets, as though such JV1 Assets and JV2
Assets had been sold for their fair market value (determined in good faith
jointly by the Members) and any gain or loss allocated among the Members in
accordance with the provisions of this Agreement and (ii) such JV1 Assets and
JV2 Assets shall be distributed in such a manner that each Member will receive
such Members proportionate interest in such assets available for such
distribution; that is to say, each Member shall receive an interest,
corresponding to the proportion to which such Member is entitled pursuant to
Section 9.4, in real estate and leaseholds and other properties, as nearly as
practicable, and in connection therewith the Liquidating Trustee shall avoid,
to the maximum extent possible, the distribution of undivided interests in the
same asset among the Members.

 

Section 9.6 _Termination_. The Company shall terminate when all of the JV1
Assets and the JV2 Assets, after payment of or due provision established for
all debts, liabilities, expenses and other obligations of the Company, shall
have been sold or otherwise distributed to the Members in the manner provided
for in this Article 9, and the Certificate of Formation shall have been
canceled in the manner required by the Act.

Section 9.7 _Claims of the Members_. Except as otherwise permitted herein,
the Members shall look solely to the JV1 Assets and the JV2 Assets for the
return of their Capital Contributions and Capital Account balances; _provided_
that the Class A Members shall look solely to the JV1 Assets and the Class
B Members shall look solely to the JV2 Assets, and if the JV1 Assets and the
JV2 Assets remaining after payment of or due provision for all debts,
liabilities and obligations of the Company are insufficient to return such
Capital Contributions or Capital Account balances, then subject to the
provisions of Section 18-607 of the Act, the Members shall have no recourse
against the Company, the JV2 Project Subsidiaries, JV1, any Subsidiary of JV1,
the JV1 Board, the JV2 Board, any individual JV1 Director, any individual JV2
Director, the Managing Member or other Member or any other Person. No Member
with a negative balance in such Members Capital Account shall have any
obligation to the Company or to the other Members or to any creditor or other
Person to restore such negative balance upon dissolution or termination of the
Company or otherwise.

BOOKS AND RECORDS; FINANCIAL AND TAX MATTERS

 

Section 10.1 _Books and Records_.

 

(a) At all times during the Term, the Managing Member shall maintain, at its
principal place of business, separate books of account for, respectively, the
Company (with respect to the business and operations of the JV2 Assets) and
JV1 (with respect to the business and operations of the JV1 Assets) that shall
show a true and accurate record in all material respects of all costs
and expenses incurred, all charges made, all credits made and received and
all income derived in connection with the operation of the Company business
(with respect to the JV2 Assets) and JV1 business (with respect to the JV1
Assets) in accordance with United States generally accepted accounting
principles (" _GAAP_ ") consistently applied, and, to the extent inconsistent
therewith, in accordance with this Agreement. Notwithstanding any provision to
the contrary of the Act, such books of account, together with a certified
copy of this Agreement and of the Certificate of Formation, shall at all times
be maintained at the principal place of business of the Company or any other
office designated by the Managing Member (which may be an office of a
Subsidiary of the Company). In addition to any other rights specifically set
forth in this Agreement, each Member shall have access to all information to
which a Member is entitled to have access pursuant to the Act. The books
of account and the records of the Company shall be audited by and reported
upon as of the end of each Fiscal Year by a firm of independent certified
public accountants of recognized national standing that shall be selected by
the Managing Member. The Company and JV1 shall maintain their books of
account and its records in accordance with GAAP and all applicable laws and
regulations in all material respects.

 

(b) All books, records and accounts of the Company and its Subsidiaries shall
be open to inspection and examination by any of the Members or their
Representatives at reasonable times and in a reasonable manner so as to not
unduly interfere with the management and business of the Company or its
Subsidiaries. The Managing Member shall cause the Company, and the Company
shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries to, cause its and their officers to
make themselves available to discuss the affairs of the Company and its
Subsidiaries upon the reasonable request of any of the Members or their
Representatives at reasonable times and in a reasonable manner so as to not
unduly interfere with the management and business of the Company or its
Subsidiaries. Such right of inspection may be exercised through any
Representative of such Member or a certified public accounting firm
of recognized international standing designated by such Member. Such Member
shall bear all expenses incurred in any examination requested by such Member
pursuant to this Section 10.1(b). Any information obtained by a Member
pursuant to this Section 10.1 shall be held in confidence pursuant to the
terms of Section 15.17.

(c) Either Member may from time to time, at its sole expense, by reasonable
advance notice to the Managing Member, obtain an appraisal of the one or more
of the JV1 Projects and JV2 Projects. Following the Managing Members receipt
of such notice, the Managing Member shall reasonably cooperate, at no out-of-
pocket cost to the Managing Member, the Company or any Subsidiary of the
Company, with such appraisers engaged by said Member to permit such appraisals
to be completed, including using reasonable efforts to furnish
such information as shall be reasonably be requested to complete the
appraisal. The parties agree

 



-52-  that appraisal and any such requests for information shall be undertaken in
a manner that does not unreasonably interfere with the business and operations
of the Managing Member, the Company or any Subsidiary of the Company.

Section 10.2 _Financial Information_. The Company shall furnish to each Member
the reports and schedules described on _Exhibit H_ in accordance with the
timelines set forth in _Exhibit H_.

 

Section 10.3 _Tax Matters_.

 

(a) CDLM is hereby designated as the "tax matters partner" of the Company
within the meaning of Section 6231 of the Code and the Treasury Regulations
promulgated thereunder (such Member, the " _Tax Matters Member_ "). Except as
otherwise provided by this Agreement, all decisions for the Company relating
to tax matters, including whether to make any tax elections, the positions to
be taken on the Companys tax returns, the determination of Capital Accounts
in accordance with Section 3.3 and Article VII of this Agreement, in each case
in connection with a liquidation pursuant to Section 9.4, and the settlement
or further contest or litigation of any audit matters raised by the Internal
Revenue Service or any other taxing authority, shall be taken only with the
consent of the Members, provided that any such decisions shall be made in a
manner consistent with _Exhibit D_. The Tax Matters Member shall (i) promptly
notify each other Member after receiving notice from any taxing authority of
any audit, controversy, litigation, examination or other proceeding with
respect to taxes or tax returns of the Company (a " _Tax Proceeding_ "), (ii)
provide to all Members all materials received in connection with such Tax
Proceeding, (iii) consult with the other Members with respect to the conduct
of any such Tax Proceeding, (iv) provide copies of all documents to be
submitted to the authorities for advance review by the Members, and (v) allow
the Members to participate fully in any Tax Proceeding and not make any
material determination without the consent of the Members, which consent shall
not be unreasonably withheld.

(b) The Company (at its expense) shall (i) prepare or cause to be prepared
IRS Forms 1065 and such other forms, federal and state tax returns or other
documents (including Schedule K-1 and any comparable state and local tax
forms) as shall be necessary to enable each Member to prepare their income
tax returns, (ii) provide such forms, tax returns or other documents to each
Member at least fifteen (15) days before the due date thereof (including
extensions) and (iii) provide quarterly estimates of taxable income or loss
within fifteen (15) days after the end of each quarter (together with a
schedule of book to taxable income, by Member, identifying both permanent and
temporary differences). The Tax Matters Member shall use
commercially reasonable efforts to provide each Member with a copy of a draft
of any material federal, state or local tax return required to be filed by the
Company at least sixty (60) days prior to the due date for the filing of such
tax return including extensions and shall consider in good faith any comments
provided by any Member.

(c) Any Member (the " _Requesting Member_ ") shall be entitled to request
that the Company make any tax election, elect not to make any tax election,
adopt any tax method or elect not to adopt any tax method (each a " _Requested
Election_ "), in each case provided that if such action would not have the
same or similar effect on both Members, it does not have a material adverse
impact on the other Member (the " _Non-Requesting Member_ ").

 



-53- (d) The Members intend that the Company shall be classified as a partnership
(other than a publicly traded partnership) for federal, and if applicable,
state and local income tax purposes, and agree to take such actions as may be
necessary to receive and maintain such treatment and refrain from taking any
actions inconsistent therewith. 

(e) In the event that the Company does not have a valid election in effect
under Section 754 of the Code with respect to any Fiscal Year during which
any Member Transfers a Membership Interest in the Company, at the request of
the Transferring Member, the Tax Matters Member shall cause the Company to
make an election under Section 754 of the Code and any like provision of any
state income tax law. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this
Agreement, the Company shall make a valid election under Section 754 of the
Code on its U.S. federal income tax return for the taxable period that
includes or ends on the date on which the transactions contemplated by the
Master Agreement are consummated.

(f) No Member shall file a notice with the Internal Revenue Service under
Section 6222(b) of the Code in connection with such Members intention to
treat an item on such Members federal income tax return in a manner which is
inconsistent with the treatment of such item on the Companys federal income
tax return unless such Member has, not less than twenty (20) days prior to the
filing of such notice, provided the Tax Matters Member with a copy of the
notice and thereafter in a timely manner provides such other information
related thereto as the Tax Matters Member shall reasonably request.

(g) _Dispute Resolution._

 

(i) In the event that a dispute arises between the Members as to (A) any
Requested Election, (B) any Class A Major Decision described in Section
4.7(b)(iv), (C) any Class B Major Decision described in Section 4.8(c)(iv), or
(D) any other tax matters requiring the determination or consent of the
Members pursuant to this Agreement (including the withholding of such
consent), the Members shall negotiate in good faith to resolve the dispute as
expeditiously as possible, provided that notwithstanding the below provisions
of this Section 10.3(g), any dispute regarding whether a particular action or
proposed action of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries constitutes a Class
A Major Decision or a Class B Major Decision shall be subject to the
procedures set forth in Section 14.2.

 

(ii) If the Members are unable through such negotiation to resolve a dispute
that relates to (A) the proper reporting of an item or items on any tax
return or related schedule, including Schedule K-1 and including the
maintenance of capital accounts and the allocations pursuant to Article 7, (B)
any decision to be made with respect to a Tax Proceeding, or (C) the proper
interpretation of applicable law in respect of any other matter described in
Section 10.3(g)(i), then such dispute shall be resolved by an independent,
nationally recognized firm of accountants experienced in tax matters which
shall be mutually selected by the Members (the " _Accounting Firm_ ").

(iii) If the Members are unable through negotiation to resolve a dispute that
relates to any Requested Election or to a change of a policy, method, election
or other determination set forth on _Exhibit D_, and in each case such
dispute does not involve an issue related to the proper interpretation of
applicable law, such dispute shall be resolved by an

 



-54-  Accounting Firm, provided that the Members shall instruct the Accounting
Firm to, and the Accounting Firm shall, (A) resolve any dispute in a manner
consistent with _Exhibit D_ (except to the extent such dispute relates to a
change of a policy, method, election or other determination set forth on
_Exhibit D_), (B) resolve any dispute in the manner requested by the
Requesting Member provided that if such action would not have the same or
similar effect on both Members, it does not have a material adverse impact on
the Non-Requesting Member, and (C) resolve any dispute in the manner requested
by the Non-Requesting Member if such action would not have the same or
similar effect on both Members, it does not have a material adverse impact on
the Non-Requesting Member.

(iv) The Members shall request any Accounting Firm designated pursuant to
Section 10.3(g)(ii) or Section 10.3(g)(iii) hereof to reach a conclusion as
promptly as possible, but in any case within thirty (30) days (or such longer
period as the Members may mutually agree in writing) from appointment of such
Accounting Firm. The resolution reached by the Accounting Firm shall be
binding on the Members and their respective Affiliates, and may be entered and
enforced in any court having jurisdiction. The Members shall each bear the
expenses incurred by it in connection with such matter, and the expenses of
the Accounting Firm shall be borne equally by Members. The existence and
resolution of matters before an Accounting Firm pursuant to this Section
10.3(g) shall be kept confidential by the Members in the same manner that
Confidential Information is kept confidential pursuant to Section 15.17.

Class A Members to sell all (but not less than all) of their Class A
Membership Interests in such transaction, on the same terms and conditions,
and for the same consideration, as set forth in such Class A Offer (the "

-56-  a written notice describing all material terms and conditions under which
the proposed Transfer is to take place (the " _Class A Tag-Along Notice_ ") to
the other Class A Members (the " _Non-Initiating Class A Members_"). The
Non-Initiating Class A Members shall have the right to Transfer all of their
respective Class A Membership Interests to the Proposed Class A Transferee on
the same terms, purchase price and conditions as the Transferring Class A
CDLM Members (the " _Class A Tag-Along Right_ "); _provided_ that, in the
event a Non-Initiating Class A Member elects to exercise its Class A Tag-
Along Right, the Non-Initiating Class A Member must respond in writing within

Transferring Class A CDLM Members, which written response shall include an
irrevocable commitment to Transfer as promptly as practicable all of its Class
A Membership Interests on the same terms, purchase price and conditions as the
Transferring Class A CDLM Members, as set forth in such Class A Tag-Along
Notice. The irrevocable commitment to Transfer such Class A Membership
Interests will be conditioned upon the absence of any injunction, order, law,
regulation or similar matter that prohibits the consummation of such Transfer

A Members Class A Membership Interests with respect to such sale. The Non-
Initiating Class A Members electing to Transfer their respective Class A
Membership Interests agree to cooperate in consummating such a Transfer,
including, by becoming a party to the sales agreement and all other
appropriate related agreements, delivering, at the consummation of such
Transfer, certificates and other instruments for such Class A Membership
Interests (if any) duly endorsed for transfer, free and clear of all
Encumbrances, and voting or consenting in favor of such transaction (to
the extent a vote or consent is required) and taking any other necessary or
appropriate action in furtherance thereof, including the execution and
delivery of any other appropriate agreements, certificates, instruments and
other documents.

 

(iii) Notwithstanding any election or participation by the Non-Initiating
Class A Members hereunder, the Transferring Class A CDLM Members shall at all
times have exclusive authority, in its sole discretion, to control, or to

Affiliate of such

 



-57-  Class B Member so long as the transferring Class B Member retains both
management and voting control of said Affiliate, or (iv) any successor entity
of such Class B Member (each, a " _Permitted Class B Transferee_ ");
_provided_ , _however_ , that, with respect to Transfers under subsections
(ii), (iii) and (iv), the transferring Class B Member shall nonetheless remain
responsible for the performance of all of its obligations hereunder. From and
after the removal of CDLM as Managing Member pursuant to Section 4.6(a) or

Plum Class B Selling Parties desire to accept (a " _Class B Offer_ ") from a
third party to purchase, in a single arms length transaction (the " _Class B

the other Class B Members to sell all (but not less than all) of their Class
B Membership Interests in such transaction, on the same terms and conditions,
and for the same consideration, as set forth in such Class B Offer (the "
_Class B Drag-Along Right_ "). The Plum Class B Selling Parties may exercise
the Class B Drag-Along Right by giving each other Class B Member written
notice (the " _Class B Drag-Along Notice_ ") of any such Class B Offer and of
the Plum Class B Selling Parties intention to exercise the Class B Drag-
Along Right, at least thirty (30) days prior to the date on which such

such Class B Member shall vote for, consent to and raise no objections to, nor
bring a claim against any of Plum, the Company or its Affiliates, or contest
or seek to enjoin the Class B Sale, or seek appraisal, dissenter or other
such similar rights. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, if such
Class B Sale is structured as: (x) a merger or consolidation, each other Class

other post-closing covenant that restricts its activities in any way. The

connection with the consummation or such Class B Sale reasonably requested by
the Plum Class B Selling Parties or the Company.

effective date shall be made to the transferee of such Membership Interests.

(c) _Transfers in Violation_. No Transfer of Membership Interests, or any
part thereof, that is in violation of this Article 11, shall be valid or
effective against, or shall bind, the Company, and neither the Company nor the
Members shall recognize the same for the purpose of making allocations,
distributions or other payments pursuant to this Agreement with respect to
such Membership Interests or part thereof. Neither the Company nor the non-
transferring Members shall incur any liability as a result of refusing to
make any such distributions to the transferee of any such invalid Transfer, or
any other Person, and no such purported transferee shall have any right to
receive allocations or payments of any Profits or Losses or distributions.
In addition, notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement to the
contrary, (i) any Transfer, as a whole or in part, of Membership Interests
shall be prohibited if, in the reasonable opinion of the Managing Member such
Transfer poses a material risk that the Company would be treated as a
"publicly traded partnership" within the meaning of Section 7704 of the Code
and the Treasury Regulations promulgated thereunder; and (ii) a Member may not
Transfer all or any part of such Persons Membership Interests if such
Transfer would jeopardize the status of the Company as a partnership for
federal income tax purposes or would violate any provision of Federal or state
securities or blue sky laws or breach the conditions to any exemption from
registration of the Membership Interests under any such laws or breach any
undertaking or agreement of a Member entered into pursuant to such laws or in
connection with obtaining an exemption thereunder.

 

Section 11.4 _Additional Members_.

 

(a) With the prior written consent of all of the Members of the Company, the
Managing Member shall have the power to admit one or more additional Members;
_provided_ that any such additional Member shall have executed such documents
as the Managing Member may reasonably require as appropriate for effecting
such admission.

 

(b) The admission of any Person as an additional Member shall be conditioned
upon such Persons written acceptance and adoption of all the terms and
provisions of this Agreement.

 



-59- (c) Additional Members shall not be entitled to any retroactive allocation of
the Companys income, gains, losses, deductions, credits or other items;
_provided_ , _however_ , that, subject to the restrictions of Section 706(d)
of the Code, additional Members shall be entitled to their respective share of
the Companys income, gains, losses, deductions, credits and other items
arising under contracts entered into before the effective date of the issuance
of any Additional Members to the extent that such income, gains, losses,
deductions, credits and other items arise after such effective date. To the
extent consistent with Section 706(d) of the Code and Treasury Regulations
promulgated thereunder, the Companys books may be closed at the time
additional Members are admitted (as though the Companys tax year had ended)
or the Company may credit to the additional Members pro rata allocations of
the Companys income, gains, losses, deductions, credits and items for that
portion of the Companys Fiscal Year after the effective date of the
admission of the additional Members.

Section 11.5 _East Edisto Assets Right of First Offer_. In the event that the
Managing Member determines to cause the Company to Transfer any undeveloped
parcels of rural and recreational land within the East Edisto North and East
Edisto South Plantation Districts JV2 Projects consisting of at least
2,500 contiguous acres to a third party for rural or recreational use or for
the purpose of harvesting timber and the same is expressly authorized in the
applicable JV2 Strategic Plan or applicable JV2 Annual Plan, the Managing
Member shall submit a written notice (the " _Sale Notice_ ") to Plum
notifying Plum of its desire to cause the Company or the applicable JV2
Project Subsidiary to Transfer the specified parcels of land that are set
forth in the Sale Notice (the " _Specified East Edisto Assets_ ") and setting
forth the material economic terms and other material terms that the Managing
Member would be willing to accept for a sale of the Specified Timberlands
Asset (the " _Specified Terms_ "). Within twenty (20) days of receipt of the
Sale Notice (the " _Offer Period_ "), Plum may provide the Managing Member
with a written offer (the " _Purchase Offer_ ") setting forth a proposed
cash purchase price and general terms and conditions upon which Plum would be
willing to acquire all of the Specified East Edisto Assets. For thirty (30)
days following the Managing Members receipt of the Purchase Offer, (the "
_Negotiation Period_ "), the Managing Member and Plum shall negotiate in good
faith to reach an agreement for the sale of the Specified East Edisto Asset to
Plum. If (a) Plum does not provide a Purchase Offer during the Offer Period
or (b) a binding agreement for a sale of the Specified East Edisto Assets is
not reached by the end of the Negotiation Period, for a period of one (1) year
following the termination of the Negotiation Period, the Company may
sell, transfer or dispose of (or enter into a binding agreement to sell,
transfer or dispose of) the Specified East Edisto Asset to a third party at a
price that is at least 90% of the purchase price set forth in the Specified
Terms and under transaction terms that are not materially less favorable to
the Company than the terms of the proposed transaction as set forth in the
Specified Terms, and, if such sale is consummated, Plum shall have no further
rights under this Section 11.5 with regards to the Specified East Edisto
Assets. If (i) at the end of such one (1)-year period, a binding agreement for
a sale of the Specified East Edisto Assets has not been reached or (ii) such a
binding agreement has been reached and is terminated prior to its
consummation, the Company shall not sell, transfer or dispose of, or negotiate
to sell, transfer or dispose of, any Specified East Edisto Assets without
first complying with the procedures set forth in this Section 11.5.

EXIT STRATEGY

 

Section 12.1 _JV1 Exit Strategy_.

 

(a) _Exit Strategy Election_. At any time after the seventh (7th) anniversary
of the date hereof, in its sole and absolute discretion, CDLM may, in
accordance with the terms of this Section 12.1, elect to either (i) liquidate,
dissolve and wind-up the business and affairs of JV1 and its Subsidiaries or
(ii) purchase for cash all of the Class A Membership Interests then held by
Plum or any of its Affiliates at a price equal to the fair market value of
such Class A Membership Interests.

 

(b) _Liquidation of JV1_.

 

(i) In the event that CDLM elects to liquidate, dissolve and wind-up of the
business and affairs of JV1 and its Subsidiaries, CDLM shall promptly provide
Plum with notice of such election and shall immediately commence to wind up
the affairs of JV1 and its Subsidiaries; _provided_ , _however_ , that a
reasonable time shall be allowed for the orderly liquidation of the assets of
JV1 and its Subsidiaries and the satisfaction of liabilities to creditors so
as to enable the Class A Members to minimize the normal losses attendant upon
a liquidation. The Class A Members shall continue to share JV1 Profits and
JV1 Losses during liquidation in the same proportions, as specified in
Article 7, as before liquidation. Each Class A Member shall repay to the
Company any loans then owing by such Person to the Company. The proceeds of
liquidation shall be distributed, as realized, in the following order and
priority:

A. First, to the payment of the expenses of liquidation; 

B. Second, to the setting up of any reserves which CDLM reasonably determines
to be necessary or desirable for any contingent or unforeseen liabilities,
expenses or other obligations of JV1 or any of its Subsidiaries;

C. Third, to the payment of the debts and liabilities of JV1 and its
Subsidiaries, other than debts and liabilities to any Class A Member;

 

D. Fourth, to the payment of the debts and liabilities of JV1 and its
Subsidiaries owed to any Class A Members; and

 

E. Fifth, to the Members in accordance with Section 8.1(b).

 

(ii) Upon the liquidation of JV1 and its Subsidiaries, any liquidating
distributions shall be made in accordance with this Section 12.1(b).
Liquidation proceeds shall be paid within sixty (60) days of the end of the
taxable year (or, if later, within one hundred and twenty (120) days after the
date of the liquidation). For purposes of making the liquidating
distributions required by this Section 12.1(b), the Managing Member shall sell
all of the assets of JV1 and its Subsidiaries and distribute the proceeds
therefrom. With the prior written consent of the Class A Members,
the Managing Member may distribute a portion of the assets of JV1 and its
Subsidiaries in kind. If any assets of JV1 and its Subsidiaries are to be so
distributed in kind

 



-61-  to the Class A Members, (i) the Capital Accounts of the Class A Members
shall be adjusted to reflect the amount, if any, of unrealized gain or loss
with respect to such assets, as though such assets had been sold for their
fair market value (determined in good faith by the JV1 Directors with at least
one (1) Plum JV1 Director in concurrence therewith) and any gain or loss
allocated among the Class A Members in accordance with the provisions of this
Agreement and (ii) such assets shall be distributed in such a manner that each
Class A Member will receive such Class A Members proportionate interest in
such assets available for such distribution; that is to say, each Class A
Member shall receive an interest, corresponding to the proportion to which
such Class A Member is entitled pursuant to this Section 12.1(b), in real
estate and leaseholds and other properties, as nearly as practicable, and in
connection therewith Managing Member shall in good faith endeavor to
distribute fee simple interests in the individual assets to the Class A
Members in accordance with their respective Class A Percentage Interests so
as to avoid to the maximum extent possible the distribution of undivided
interests in the same asset among the Class A Members. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, Managing Member shall liquidate JV1 promptly upon the sale of all
of the JV1 Projects in accordance with the terms of this Section 12.1(b), it
being understood and agreed that said liquidation shall proceed even if there
remain any JV2 Assets.

 

(c) _Purchase of Plum s Class A Membership Interests_.

 

(i) In the event that CDLM elects to purchase for cash all of Plums Class A
Membership Interests pursuant to Section 12.1(a)(ii) at a price equal to the
fair market value of such Class A Membership Interests, CDLM shall deliver a
written notice (a " _Purchase Notice_ ") to Plum indicating (A) that it has
elected to exercise its right to purchase Plums Class A Membership Interests
pursuant to this Section 12.1, (B) its good faith determination of the
proposed fair market value of Plums Class A Membership Interests (the "
_Proposed Fair Market Value_ "), and (C) in reasonable detail, the
assumptions and calculations used by CDLM to determine such Proposed Fair
Market Value. If within thirty (30) days after its receipt of the Proposed
Fair Market Value, Plum does not give a written notice of dispute regarding
the Proposed Fair Market Value (a " _Fair Market Value Dispute Notice_ ") to
CDLM, the Class A Members agree that the final determination of the fair
market value of Plums Class A Membership Interests for purposes of this
Section 12.1(c) (the " _Final Determination_ ") shall be equal to the Proposed
Fair Market Value. The Fair Market Value Dispute Notice shall state the view
of Plum as to the fair market value of its Class A Membership Interests (the
" _Response Fair Market Value_ "), together with the information set forth in
clause (C) above supporting such view. If Plum gives a Fair Market Value
Dispute Notice within such thirty (30) day period, the Class A Members shall
use commercially reasonable efforts to resolve the dispute during the fifteen
(15) day period commencing on the date CDLM receives the Fair Market Value
Dispute Notice and if the Class A Members agree during said fifteen (15) day
period on the fair market value of Plums Class A Membership Interest, then
said fair market Value shall be the Final Determination for purposes of
this Section 12.1(c).

(ii) If the Class A Members do not agree upon the fair market value of Plums
Class A Membership Interests within such fifteen (15) day period, the Class A
Members shall appoint a mutually acceptable, nationally recognized appraiser
with Master Appraisal Institute (" _MAI_ ") certification (the " _Appraiser_
") to conduct an independent evaluation to determine the fair market value of
Plums Class A Membership Interests, which shall be determined no later than
thirty (30) Business Days after such appointment (the " _Third Party_

 



-62-   _Determination_ "); _provided_ that if the Class A Members are unable to
agree upon an appraiser with MAI certification to serve as the Appraiser, each
Class A Member shall appoint an appraiser with MAI certification and such
appraisers shall appoint a third appraiser with MAI certification who shall
serve as the Appraiser. The Class A Members shall be equally responsible for
the fees of the Appraiser. The Third Party Determination shall be an amount
between or equal to the (i) Proposed Fair Market Value and (ii) Response Fair
Market Value. In connection with the Third Party Determination, the Appraiser
shall have access to all documents, records, work papers, facilities and
personnel necessary to make such determination. Each Class A Member and its
Representatives shall be afforded the opportunity to present to the Appraiser
any material such Class A Member deems relevant to the Proposed Fair Market
Value or Response Fair Market Value, as applicable, and shall make itself
available to discuss the matter with the Appraiser at the request of the
Appraiser; _provided_ that any material presented to or by the Appraiser
shall be at the same time made available in the same form and substance to the
other Class A Member. The Third Party Determination shall be the Final
Determination and shall be conclusive and binding upon the Class A Members. 

(iii) Within thirty (30) Business Days following the Final Determination, CDLM
shall purchase, and Plum shall sell, all of Plums Class A Membership
Interests in exchange for the consideration per share, based on the fair
market value set forth in such Final Determination. The foregoing sale shall
be promptly completed, but in no event later than sixty (60) days from the
date of the Final Determination; _provided_ that if the sale of such Class A
Membership Interests is subject to any prior regulatory approval, the time
period during which such sale must be consummated shall be extended solely
for such purposes until the expiration of five (5) Business Days after all
such approvals have been received.

 

Section 12.2 _JV2 Exit Strategy_.

 

(a) Unless otherwise approved by the JV2 Board, commencing upon the seventh
(7th) anniversary of the date hereof, the Managing Member will, in accordance
with the terms of this Section 12.2, liquidate, dissolve and wind up the
business and affairs of the Company that relate to the JV2 Assets (including
the JV2 Project Subsidiaries).

 

(b) Upon the seventh (7th) anniversary of the date hereof, the Managing Member
shall immediately commence to wind up the affairs of the Company that relate
to the JV2 Assets (including the JV2 Project Subsidiaries); _provided_ ,
_however_ , that a reasonable time shall be allowed for the orderly
liquidation of the JV2 Assets and the satisfaction of liabilities to
creditors so as to enable the Class B Members to minimize the normal losses
attendant upon a liquidation; _provided_ , _further_ , that the Class B
Members shall use their reasonable best efforts to ensure that such
liquidation is undertaken in a tax efficient manner. The Class B Members
shall continue to share JV2 Profits and JV2 Losses during liquidation in the
same proportions, as specified in Article 7, as before liquidation. Each Class
B Member shall pay to the Company any loans then owing by such Person to the
Company. The proceeds of liquidation shall be distributed, as realized, in the
following order and priority:

 

(i) First, to the payment of the expenses of liquidation;

 



-63- (ii) Second, to the setting up of any reserves which the JV2 Directors
determine to be necessary or desirable for any contingent or unforeseen
liabilities, expenses or other obligations of the Company that relate to the
JV2 Assets (including the JV2 Project Subsidiaries);

 

(iii) Third, to the payment of the debts and liabilities of the Company that
relate to the JV2 Assets (including the JV2 Project Subsidiaries), other than

relate to the JV2 Assets (including the JV2 Project Subsidiaries) owed to any
Class B Members; and

(v) Fifth, to the Members in accordance with Section 8.1(c).

(c) Upon the liquidation of the JV2 Assets, any liquidating distributions
shall be made in accordance with Section 12.2(b). Liquidation proceeds shall
be paid within sixty (60) days of the end of the taxable year (or, if later,
within one hundred and twenty (120) days after the date of the liquidation).
For purposes of making the liquidating distributions required by Section
12.2(b), the Managing Member shall sell all or any portion of the JV2 Assets
and distribute the proceeds therefrom. With the prior written consent of the
Class B Members, the Managing Member may distribute a portion of the JV2
Assets in kind. If any JV2 Assets are to be so distributed in kind to the
Class B Members, the Class B Senior Preferred Members or the Class B
Subordinated Preferred Members, (i) the Capital Accounts of the Class B
Members, the Class B Senior Preferred Members and the Class B Subordinated
Preferred Members shall be adjusted to reflect the amount, if any, of
unrealized gain or loss with respect to such assets, as though such assets had
been sold for their fair market value (determined in good faith by the JV2
Directors with at least one (1) Plum JV2 Director in concurrence therewith)
and any gain or loss allocated among the Class B Members, the Class B Senior
Preferred Members and the Class B Subordinated Preferred Members in
accordance with the provisions of this Agreement and (ii) such assets shall be
distributed in such a manner that each Class B Member, Class B Senior
Preferred Member and Class B Subordinated Preferred Member will receive such
Class B Members, Class B Senior Preferred Members or Class B Subordinated
Preferred Members proportionate interest in such assets available for such
distribution; that is to say, each Class B Member, Class B Senior Preferred
Member and Class B Subordinated Preferred Member shall receive an interest,
corresponding to the proportion to which such Class B Member, Class B Senior
Preferred Member and Class B Subordinated Preferred Member is
entitled pursuant to Section 12.2(b), in real estate and leaseholds and other
properties, as nearly as practicable, and in connection therewith Managing
Member shall in good faith endeavor to distribute fee simple interests in the
individual assets to the Class B Members in accordance with their respective
Class B Percentage Interests so as to avoid to the maximum extent possible the
distribution of undivided interests in the same asset among the Class B
Members. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Managing Member shall liquidate
the business and affairs of the Company that relate to the JV2 Assets
(including the JV2 Project Subsidiaries) promptly upon the sale of all of the
JV2 Projects in accordance with the terms of Section 12(b) and this Section
12.2(c), it being understood and agreed that said liquidation shall proceed
even if there remain any JV1 Assets.

 



-64- (d) At any time after the seventh (7th) anniversary of the date hereof,
whether or not a Buy/Sell Trigger Event has occurred, either Class B Member
may deliver a Buy/Sell Notice to the other Class B Member with respect to any
of the JV2 Projects and the Class B Member that delivers the Buy/Sell Notice
shall be deemed to be the Triggering Party under Section 14.1(c)(i). With
respect to any Buy/Sell Notice delivered pursuant to this Section 12.2(d), the
buy/sell procedures shall be conducted in accordance with the procedures set
forth in Section 14.1(c)-(e). 

Section 12.3 _Cooperation on Exit_. In the event that CDLM elects to liquidate
JV1 or to purchase for cash all of the Class A Membership Interests then held
by Plum or any of its Affiliates, in each case pursuant to Section 12.1, and
prior to the Managing Member commencing to liquidate, dissolve and wind up the
business and affairs of the Company that relate to the JV2 Assets (including
the JV2 Project Subsidiaries) pursuant to Section 12.2, the parties shall work
together in good faith to structure such purchase or liquidation, as the case
may be, in a manner that is as tax efficient to the parties as possible.

defendant or respondent in any Proceeding (but not in any Proceeding where

employees to segregate the separate operations of the JV1 Projects, on the one
hand, and the JV2 Projects, on the other hand, including (i) separation and

or

(e) with respect to Defined Losses not covered by any of Section 13.7(a),

by Plum and (iii) Plums

 



-67-  proportionate share of the aggregate appraised value of any capital

DISPUTE RESOLUTION

 

Section 14.1 JV2 _Project Dispute Buy/Sell_.

 

(a) In the event that (i) the JV2 Board does not approve a Class B Major
Decision set forth in subclause (x), (xi) or (xiv) through (xvii) of Section
4.8(c), (ii) the Company or the Managing Member has undertaken an action that
constitutes a Class B Major Decision set forth in subclause (x), (xi) or
(xiv)-(xvii) of Section 4.8(c) without the prior receipt of the required
approval of the JV2 Board and fails to cure the breach or rescind the actions
which caused the breach, in either case, to the reasonable satisfaction of
Plum within ten (10) days of MWVs receipt of a written notice from Plum
(setting forth in reasonable detail the facts and circumstances pertaining
thereto and the basis for Plums allegation that the Company has breached
Section 4.8(c)), (iii) the JV2 Board fails to approve a JV2 Annual Plan for a
particular JV2 Project as set forth in Section 4.8(b)(ii), or (iv) the JV2
Board fails to approve an Alternative JV2 Strategic Plan for a particular JV2
Project as set forth in Section 4.8(b)(iii) (each of the foregoing a "
_Buy/Sell Trigger Event_ "), then either Class B Member (the Class B Member
delivering the notice, the " _Triggering Party_ ") may deliver a non-binding
written notice (a " _Buy/Sell Intent Notice_ ") to the other Class B Member
(the " _Reviewing Party_ ") indicating that it desires to initiate the
buy/sell procedure set forth in this Section 14.1.

binding resolution of the differences that led to the receipt of such
Buy/Sell Intent Notice, no less than five (5) Business Days and no more than
fifteen (15) Business Days after the delivery of such Buy/Sell Intent Notice
(the " _Resolution Period_ ") the Triggering Party may initiate the Buy/Sell
procedure set forth in this Section 14.1. If the Triggering Party does not

initiate the Buy/Sell procedure set forth in this Section 14.1 within the
next five (5) Business Days, in which event for purposes of the buy/sell
procedure the Reviewing Party under Section 14.1(a) will be deemed the
Triggering Party for purposes of Section 14.1(c) and the Triggering Party
under Section 14.1(a) will be deemed the Reviewing Party for purposes of
Section 14.1(c). If neither Class B Member shall have initiated the Buy/Sell

delivery of the Buy/Sell Intent Notice, then such Buy/Sell Intent Notice shall
be void and have no further force and effect, but any Class B Member shall be
entitled to send a new Buy/Sell Intent Notice in accordance with the
procedures of this Section 14.1.

(i) The Triggering Party shall initiate the buy/sell procedure with respect to
the applicable JV2 Project by sending a notice to the Reviewing Party (the "
_Buy/Sell Notice_ ") which shall: (A) be in writing and be signed by the
Triggering Party; and (B) specify a

 



-68-  cash purchase price (the " _Buy/Sell Purchase Price_ ") at which the
Triggering Party shall choose to either (x) purchase from Reviewing Party, in
cash, all, but not part of, of the applicable JV2 Project (the " _Buy Offer_
"), or (y) sell to the Reviewing Party for cash all, but not part of, the
applicable JV2 Project (the " _Sell Offer_ "), in either case on the terms and
conditions set forth below and subject to the provisions of this Section
14.1.

(ii) Within twenty (20) Business Days after the Reviewing Party receives the
Buy/Sell Notice (the " _Election Period_ "), the Reviewing Party must provide
written notice to the Triggering Party (an " _Election Notice_ "), which
Election Notice must indicate either that (A) the Reviewing Party accepts the
offer contained in the Buy/Sell Notice or (B)(x) if the Buy/Sell Notice
contained a Buy Offer, the Reviewing Party rejects the Buy Offer and agrees to
purchase from the Triggering Party all, but not part of, the applicable JV2
Project or (y) if the Buy/Sell Notice contained a Sell Offer, the Reviewing
Party rejects the Sell Offer and agrees to sell to the Triggering Party all,
but not part of, the applicable JV2 Project for a cash purchase price equal
to the Buy/Sell Purchase Price.

(iii) If the Reviewing Party fails to give an Election Notice within the
required twenty (20) Business Day period, then the Reviewing Party shall be
deemed to have accepted the Triggering Partys offer contained in the Buy/Sell
Notice.

 

(iv) In the event of any Buy Offer, the Triggering Party must include with the
Buy/Sell Notice evidence reasonably acceptable to the Reviewing Party of its
ability to finance the proposed acquisition.

(d) _Sales Procedure_. A purchase and sale of a JV2 Project in accordance
with this Section 14.1 shall be accomplished in accordance with the following
provisions:

(i) The proceeds that the selling Class B Member (the " _Selling Party_ ")
with respect to the sale of the JV2 Project shall be payable solely in cash
and shall be equal to (A) the amount that would be distributable to the
Selling Party by the Company if the Company or the applicable JV2 Project
Subsidiary had sold the applicable JV2 Project for a price equal to the
Buy/Sell Purchase Price and disbursed such proceeds to the Company for
distribution to the Members in accordance with Sections 8.1(b) and (d).

(ii) The sale shall be consummated at a closing held on the Buy/Sell Transfer
Date at such location as may be designated in writing by the purchasing Class
B Member (the " _Purchasing Party_ "). As used herein, the " _Buy/Sell
Transfer Date_ " means the date that is no later than thirty (30) Business
Days after the expiration of the Election Period, or such other day as the
Members may agree; _provided_ , _however_ , that, if the sale of such JV2
Project is subject to any prior regulatory approval, the time period during
which such sale may be consummated shall be extended solely for such purposes
until the expiration of five (5) days after all such approvals shall have been
received, but in no event shall such period be extended for more than ninety
(90) Business Days from the expiration of the Election Period.

(e) If for any reason the Purchasing Party fails to close as aforesaid, in
addition to any other remedies available under this Agreement or at law or in
equity by reason thereof, the Selling Party shall have the right, exercisable
by written notice to the Purchasing

 



-69-  Party given within thirty (30) Business Days of the date set for the
Buy/Sell Transfer Date, to purchase under this Section 14.1 the applicable JV2
Project. If the Selling Party exercises such option, the purchase price used
for the purposes of this Section 14.2(e) shall be ninety percent (90%) of the
Buy/Sell Purchase Price.

 

Section 14.2 _Major Decision Dispute_.

 

(a) In the event of any dispute regarding whether a particular action or
proposed action by or on behalf of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
constitutes a Class A Major Decision or a Class B Major Decision (a " _Major
Decision Dispute_ "), the parties agree that any such Major Decision Dispute
shall be resolved by expedited arbitration set forth in Section 14.2(d) ("
_Arbitration_ "), the result of which shall be binding upon the Class A
Members or Class B Members, as applicable.

 

(b) Prior to initiating an Arbitration proceeding, a Class A Member or Class B
Member, as applicable, first must send a written notice to the other Class A
Member or Class B Member, as applicable, (i) describing the Major Decision
Dispute; and (ii) requesting attempted resolution of the Major Decision
Dispute by good faith negotiations in accordance with Section 14.2(c).

(c) A senior executive officer of the ultimate parent companies of each Class
A Member or Class B Member, as applicable, shall designate a group of no more
than three individuals to participate in good faith negotiations with a like
group designated by the other Member aimed at resolving the Major Decision
Dispute. The respective groups shall meet to conduct good faith negotiations
during the fifteen (15) Business Day period following receipt of the notice
(such period, as it may be extended by mutual written consent, being the "
_Designees Discussion Period_ "). By mutual written consent, the parties may
extend the fifteen (15) Business Day period for conducting such negotiations.
If the Members fail to resolve the Major Decision Dispute within the Designees
Discussion Period, then such senior executive officers of the ultimate parent
companies of each Class A Member or Class B Member, as applicable, shall
review such Major Decision Dispute, and shall conduct good faith negotiations
with respect to such Dispute within the five (5) Business Days following the
end of the Designees Discussion Period. If the Major Decision Dispute is not
resolved within said five (5) Business Day period after the end of the
Designees Discussion Period (the " _Discussion Period_ "), rather Member may
initiate an Arbitration proceeding as provided in Section 14.2(d) (all such
timeframes set forth in this Section 14.2(c), the " _Internal Discussion
Timeframes_ ").

 

(d) In the event that a Major Decision Dispute is not resolved within the
Internal Discussion Timeframes in accordance with Section 14.2(c), if
requested by either Class A Member or Class B Member, as applicable, shall
mutually request an expedited arbitration which shall be conducted in
accordance with the Rules of Arbitration of the American
Arbitration Association (the " _Rules_ ") insofar as such Rules are not
inconsistent with the provisions expressly set forth in this Agreement, unless
the Members mutually agree otherwise, and pursuant to the following
procedures:

 

(i) The arbitration, which shall take place in New York, New York, shall be
conducted by a single arbitrator, who shall be selected by the mutual
agreement of the

 



-70-  Class A Members or Class B Members, as applicable, within fourteen (14) days
of the end of the Discussion Period. If the Class A Members or the Class B
Members, as applicable, are unable to mutually agree on an arbitrator, the
Class A Members or the Class B Members, as applicable, shall request the
American Arbitration Association to appoint an arbitrator within fourteen (14)
days of such request.

 

(ii) The proceedings before the arbitrator shall be held within thirty (30)
days of selection of the arbitrator in accordance with Section 14.2(d)(i).

(iii) The arbitrator shall render a decision within thirty (30) days of the
conclusion of the proceedings, which decision shall be conclusive and binding
upon the Class A Members or Class B Members, as applicable, and judgment upon
the same may be entered into any court having jurisdiction thereof.

 

(iv) The existence and resolution of the arbitrator shall be kept confidential
by the Members in the same manner that Confidential Information is kept
confidential pursuant to Section 15.17.

(v) The Members shall bear their own costs incurred in connection with the
Arbitration and share equally the fees and expenses of the arbitrator and the
costs of administration. Notwithstanding the provisions of this Section, any
dispute or arbitration during the term of this Agreement shall not relieve any
party from its obligations hereunder. For the avoidance of doubt, the Members
acknowledge and agree that the Arbitration provisions of this Section 14.2(d)
are intended to resolve a dispute as to whether a particular decision or
determination constitutes a Class A Major Decision or Class B Major Decision,
and are not intended to resolve the actual Class A Major Decision or Class B
Major Decision itself.

written, electronic or any other form or medium) (collectively, "
_Confidential Information_ "). In addition, each Member acknowledges that: (a)
the Company has invested, and continues to invest, substantial time, expense

Company) at any time any Confidential Information of which such Member is or
becomes aware. Each Member in possession of Confidential Information shall

Information: (i) upon the order of any court or administrative agency; (ii)
upon the request or demand of any Governmental Authority having jurisdiction
over such Member; (iii) to the extent compelled by legal process or required
or requested pursuant to subpoena, interrogatories or other discovery
requests; (iv) to the extent necessary in connection with the exercise of any
remedy hereunder; (v) to other Members in their capacities as such; (vi) to
such Members Representatives who, in the reasonable judgment of such Member,
need to know such Confidential Information and agree to be bound by the
provisions of this Section 15.17 as if a Member; or (vii) to any Affiliate in
connection with a proposed Transfer of Membership Interests from such Member,
as long as such transferee agrees to be bound by the provisions of this
Section 15.17 as if a Member; _provided_ that in the case of clause (i), (ii)
or (iii), such Member shall notify the Company and the other Members of the
proposed disclosure as far in advance of such disclosure as practicable (but
in no event make any such disclosure before notifying the Company and the
other Members) and use reasonable efforts to ensure that any Confidential
Information so disclosed is accorded confidential treatment satisfactory to
the Company, when and if available. The restrictions of this Section 15.17
shall not apply to Confidential Information that: (w) is or becomes generally
available to the public other than as a

 



-74-  result of a disclosure by a Member in violation of this Agreement; (x) is or
becomes available to a Member or any of its Representatives on a non-
confidential basis prior to its disclosure to the receiving Member and any of
its Representatives in compliance with this Agreement; (y) is or has been
independently developed or conceived by such Member without use of
Confidential Information; or (z) becomes available to the receiving Member or
any of its Representatives on a non-confidential basis from a source other

_provided_ that such source is not known by the recipient of the Confidential
Information to be bound by a confidentiality agreement with the disclosing
Member or any of its Representatives.

Agreement, all costs and expenses incurred by the parties hereto in

Plum, until the seventh (7th) anniversary of the date hereof, neither the
Managing Member nor MWV nor their respective Affiliates (other than the
Company and its Subsidiaries) (collectively the " _MWV Restricted Entities_ ")
will (a) construct and market improved residential lots, (b) sell entitled
unimproved residential lots or (c) sell large acreage recreational
plantations, in each case that would result in a MWV Restricted Entity
offering substantially the same product as, and thereby competing with,
the East Edisto North and South Projects set forth in the JV2 Strategic Plans
(each, a " _Restricted Development Opportunity_ ") within the area shown on
the map attached as _Exhibit J_ ; _provided_ , _however_ , that the
MWV Restricted Entities may do each of the following without any MWV
Restricted Entity being deemed to be in violation of this Section 15.19:

 

(i) maintain an interest or manage (x) any of the initial JV1 Projects and any
of the JV2 Projects (other than the East Edisto North and East Edisto South
JV2 Projects) or (y) any of the JV2 Projects that a MWV Restricted Entity may
acquire pursuant Sections 14.1 (collectively, the " _Excluded Projects_ ");
_provided_ that, for the avoidance of doubt, management of an Excluded
Project shall include the ability to acquire contiguous parcels of land, if in
the reasonable judgment of the MWV Restricted Entity, such acquisitions will
enhance the value of the Excluded Projects;

 

(ii) maintain an interest or manage any future development projects where a
MWV Restricted Entity invests in infrastructure to subdivide and/or improve
residential lots, except to the extent that such a development project would
offer product that is substantially the same as the JV2 Projects that are then
platted and for sale or under construction;

 

(iii) own or hold up to 10% of the outstanding securities of any entity whose
securities are listed and traded on a nationally recognized securities
exchange or market that maintains an interest or manages a Restricted
Development Opportunity;

(iv) merge, consolidate or otherwise engage in a business combination with,
or sell all or substantially all of its assets or businesses to, any Person
that is not an Affiliate of any MWV Restricted Entity who holds an interest in
a Restricted Development 

 



-75-  Opportunity and continues to operate such existing Restricted Development
Opportunity, and, upon the consummation of such a permitted transaction, the
restrictions set forth in this Section 15.19 shall immediately terminate and
be of no further effect with respect to said Restricted Development
Opportunity; and

 

(v) purchase or acquire (through merger, stock purchase or purchase of all or
substantially all of the assets or otherwise) any entity that holds an
interest in a Restricted Development Opportunity and continue to operate such
existing Restricted Development Opportunities; _provided_ , that if, in the
last completed fiscal quarter prior to the consummation of the purchase
or acquisition, the aggregate consolidated net asset value of such Restricted
Development Opportunities exceeded twenty five percent (25%) of such acquired
entitys total net asset value over the same period, then the acquiring MWV
Restricted Entity shall commence as promptly as practicable a process to sell
all or a portion of such Restricted Development Opportunities to an un-
Affiliated third party and shall use reasonable best efforts to complete such
sale within twenty-four (24) months of such consummation of the purchase or
acquisition, such that the net asset value of the acquired entity attributable
to the Restricted Development Opportunities does not exceed twenty five
percent (25%) of the total net asset value of the acquired entity.

 _INSTALLMENT NOTE_



      |  | 
---|---|--- 
    $860,000,000.00 |  | [INSERT CLOSING DATE], 2013 
 

FOR VALUE RECEIVED, PLUM CREEK TIMBERLANDS, L.P., a Delaware limited
partnership (the " _Borrower_ "), hereby executes this installment note ("
_Installment Note_ ") and promises to pay to the order of [ ], a
[STATE] [FORM OF ENTITY] or its permitted assignees (" _Holder_ "),1 the
principal sum of Eight Hundred and Sixty Million and no/100ths Dollars
($860,000,000) (" _Principal Sum_ ") together with interest at the rate set
forth in _Section 1_ below. This Installment Note will be unsecured and
unsubordinated indebtedness of the Borrower and will rank equally with all of
the Borrowers other unsecured and unsubordinated indebtedness from time to
time outstanding. Capitalized terms used but not otherwise defined herein
shall have the meanings ascribed to such terms in _Article 4_ of Appendix A to
this Installment Note, which is attached hereto and made a part hereof ("
_Appendix A_ "); for the avoidance of doubt, the term "Installment Note"
shall refer collectively to this installment note and Appendix A.

 

1\. _Interest_.

(a) Subject to _Section 19_ below and the remainder of this _Section 1_,
the unpaid Principal Sum shall bear interest from the date hereof until paid
in full at a fixed rate per annum equal to %2 (the " _Interest Rate_ ")

(b) Interest at the rate or rates provided herein shall be payable on each
Payment Date (defined below). All interest payable under the terms of this
Installment Note shall be calculated on the basis of twelve (12) 30-day months
in a 360-day year.

 

(c) If any amount of the Principal Sum is not paid when due (without regard to
any applicable grace periods), whether at stated maturity, by acceleration or
otherwise, such amount shall thereafter bear interest at a rate per annum at
all times equal to the interest rate then in effect _plus_ two percent (2%)
(the " _Default Rate_ ") to the fullest extent permitted by applicable Laws.
Upon the request of Holder, if any amount (other than the Principal Sum)
payable by the Borrower hereunder is not paid when due (without regard to any
applicable grace periods), whether at stated maturity, by acceleration
or otherwise, then such amount shall thereafter bear interest at the Default
Rate to the fullest extent permitted by applicable Laws. Upon the request of
Holder, while any other Event of Default exists, the Borrower shall pay
interest on the obligations owing under this Installment Note (including the
Principal Sum) at the Default Rate to the fullest extent permitted by
applicable Laws. Accrued and unpaid interest on past due amounts (including
interest on past due interest) shall be due and payable on demand.



   1  | To be determined at Closing and subject to MWVs sole discretion
in the Purchase Agreement (as long as Holder at Closing is either MWV or a
wholly-owned Subsidiary designated by MWV). 
---|--- 
   2  | To be inserted at Closing consistent with the terms of the
Purchase Agreement. 
---|--- 
 



1 2\. _Payments and Maturity_.

 

(a) Interest on the unpaid Principal Sum shall be due and payable semi-
annually, on the first day of each May and November (each a " _Payment Date_
"), commencing on May 1, 2014, and continuing on each Payment Date thereafter
through and until the Maturity Date.

 

(b) The entire unpaid Principal Sum, together with all accrued and unpaid
interest, shall mature and be due and payable in full on [INSERT DATE THAT IS
10THANNIVERSARY OF CLOSING] (" _Original Maturity Date_ " and as extended with
respect to all or a portion of the Principal Sum in accordance with the
remainder of this paragraph, the " _Maturity Date_ "). Notwithstanding the
Original Maturity Date, if (i) at least 180 days prior to the Original
Maturity Date, Holder provides written notice to the Borrower of Holders
request to extend the Original Maturity Date with respect to all or a portion
not less than $200,000,000 of the Principal Sum (an " _Extension Request_ "),
and (ii) Borrower consents in writing to such Extension Request, such consent
to be given or withheld, subject to the second succeeding sentence, in
Borrowers sole discretion, then, with respect to the Principal Sum or, if
applicable, the portion of the Principal Sum specified in the Extension
Request or an amount otherwise consented to by Borrower, the Original
Maturity Date shall automatically be extended to the date so requested by
Holder or, if earlier, at Borrowers election, the expected Maturity Date of
any Refinancing Indebtedness (as defined below). For all purposes hereunder,
such date shall thereafter be the "Maturity Date" with respect to the
Principal Sum or applicable portion thereof, as the case may be, _provided_
that any portion of the Principal Sum as to which the Original Maturity Date
has not been extended as provided in the immediately preceding sentence shall
remain due and payable on the Original Maturity Date. The Borrower agrees that
it shall consent to an Extension Request if (i) at the time of the Extension
Request the Borrower intends to refinance all or a portion not less than
$200,000,000 of this Installment Note on or prior to the Original Maturity
Date with the proceeds of new indebtedness for borrowed money (including,
without limitation, indebtedness evidenced by bonds, notes or similar
Instruments or advanced under a bank credit facility) that has a term greater
than or equal to 5 years from its issuance (" _Refinancing Indebtedness_ ")
(it being understood that the requirement that the Borrower consent to such
Extension Request shall only apply to an amount of the Principal Sum equal to
the amount of the contemplated Refinancing Indebtedness) and (ii) Holder
consents that the terms of this Installment Note, other than interest rate
which shall be determined as set forth below, will be amended to be
substantially consistent with the terms that would reasonably be expected to
apply to the contemplated Refinancing Indebtedness. Borrower covenants to
respond in writing to any Extension Request no later than 60 days prior to the
Original Maturity Date in accordance with Section 13 below and the parties
agree to cooperate to amend this Installment Note in a manner consistent
with this paragraph upon the extension of the Maturity Date in accordance
herewith. In the event that the Maturity Date is extended in accordance with
this paragraph, the Interest Rate shall be reset, as to the applicable portion
of the Principal Sum, to the Extension Interest Rate on a date to be agreed
upon by Holder and Borrower, but in no event shall such date be later than the
Original Maturity Date. For purposes hereof, " _Extension Interest Rate_ "
means the all-in yield (including interest rate and original issue discount,
and 50% of other customary fees and expenses, including arrangement and
similar fees) Borrower would have been expected to incur in connection with
Refinancing Indebtedness with a maturity of the Maturity Date as extended
pursuant to this paragraph.

(c) If any payment under this Installment Note is due on a day which is not
a Business Day, such payment shall be due and payable on the next succeeding
Business Day as if made on the date such payment was due and without including
the additional days elapsed in the computation of the interest payable on such
next succeeding Business Day.

 



2 3\. _Application and Place of Payments_. All payments made on account of
this Installment Note shall be applied, first, to the payment of any unpaid
and accrued enforcement and collection costs incurred by Holder, if any,
second, to the payment of accrued and unpaid interest, and the remainder, if
any, shall be applied to the unpaid Principal Sum. All payments on account of
this Installment Note shall be paid in immediately available funds via wire
transfer to an account designated in writing by Holder.

 

4\. _Optional Prepayment_.

 

(a) The Borrower may prepay this Installment Note in whole or in part for cash
at 100% of the Principal Sum or portion thereof prepaid,  _plus_ accrued but
unpaid interest, if any, to, but not including, the prepayment date, _plus_
the Breakage Amount (if any) as follows: (i) at any time on or after October
1, 2023 (which date shall be modified as agreed by the Borrower and Holder in
connection with an extension pursuant to Section 2(b)) or (ii) at any time in
the event MeadWestvaco Corporation or one of its wholly-owned Subsidiaries
ceases to be the sole beneficial and legal owner of this Installment Note
(excluding, for the avoidance of doubt, any pledge of this Installment Note to
one or more Eligible Assignees); or

(b) At any time during the 180-day period following receipt by the Borrower
of notice from Holder that Holder intends to withhold its consent to any
amendment or waiver of this Installment Note that was requested by the
Borrower and approved by any Eligible Assignees (or, as applicable, the
requisite majority of financing sources for whom an Eligible Assignee serves
as agent or trustee) to which this Installment Note has been pledged (an "
_Optional Prepayment Event_ "), the Borrower may prepay this Installment Note
in whole but not in part for cash at 100% of the Principal Sum, _plus_ accrued
but unpaid interest, if any, to, but not including, the prepayment date,
_plus_ the Breakage Amount (if any);  _provided_ , _however_ , that the
Borrowers right to prepay the Note pursuant to this paragraph 4(b) shall
terminate upon the 181st day after an Optional Prepayment Event shall
have occurred.

The Borrower shall not otherwise have the right to prepay this Installment
Note unless Holder shall have granted its prior written consent, which
consent may be given or withheld at Holders sole discretion.

5\. _Purchase Agreement and Related Transactions_. The Borrower, as
purchaser, and Holder, as seller, are parties to a Master Purchase and Sale
Agreement dated as of October , 2013 (as such agreement may be

Borrower has purchased from Holder the Installment Sale Timberlands (as
defined in the Purchase Agreement), which are more particularly described in
such Purchase Agreement, and the Borrower is issuing this Installment Note
in payment of the purchase price for the Installment Sale Timberlands.

remaining part of the affected provision) of this Installment Note; but

unenforceable provision had not been contained in this Installment Note, but
only to the extent it is invalid, illegal, or unenforceable.
