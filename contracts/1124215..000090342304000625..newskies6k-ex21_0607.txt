the Assumed Liabilities. Purchaser and Seller agree to treat
such contribution as a taxable transaction for Dutch corporate income tax
purposes. At the Closing, Seller shall sell, transfer, deliver, convey and
assign to Purchaser, and Purchaser shall purchase and accept from Seller, all
of Seller\'s right, title and interest in all of the stock of the Target
Subsidiaries. All incremental out-of-pocket expenses related to the

structuring the acquisition of the Assets and the  assumption of the Assumed
Liabilities and shall take any and all  reasonable actions necessary to
effectuate such alternative structure  (including without limitation entering
into separate agreements with  respect to such transactions), provided that
(i) Seller shall not be  required to take any action that would be reasonably
likely to delay,  or have an adverse effect on the Parties\' ability to
consummate, the  Closing and (ii) such cooperation and other actions would
not be  reasonably likely to have an adverse effect on the economic benefits
to  either Purchaser or Seller of the transactions contemplated by this 
Agreement.   ARTICLE III   REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF SELLER

nature of the business conducted by it makes such qualification or  licensing
necessary, except where the failures to be so duly qualified  or licensed and
in good standing have not had and would not reasonably  be expected to have,
individually or in the aggregate, a Material  Adverse Effect.   (d) Seller
has heretofore delivered or made available to  Parent accurate and complete
copies of the articles of association and  by-laws or other similar
organizational documents in effect as of the  date hereof of Seller and each

contemplated by this  Agreement or to consummate the transactions
contemplated hereby.   Section 3.03. Regulatory Reports; Financial

Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC") from and after January 1,
2002, each of which (including any financial statements or schedules included
or incorporated by reference therein), as of its respective date, was
prepared in accordance and fully complied in all material respects with all
applicable requirements (except if, and to the extent that, such registration
statement, schedule, statement, form, report or other document was
subsequently amended, superseded or supplemented by a filing made prior to
the date hereof). No Subsidiary of Seller is required to file any form,

the date of such filing), any untrue statement of a material fact or omitted

Federal Acquisition Regulations or other similar  applicable Laws by any
Governmental Authority from  bidding for, or obtaining any Government
Contract  for services provided by, Seller or its  Subsidiaries, and to
Seller\'s Knowledge, no such  Proceeding is pending or threatened.   (ii)

the  amount, of any compensation due to any Person under any Seller Plan 
with the exception of the vesting or payments to be made in connection  with
the cancellation, expiration, extinguishment or vesting, as  applicable, of

Knowledge, neither Seller nor any Subsidiary of Seller has received any
written notice of any pending or threatened claim with respect to any
Intellectual Property owned or used by Seller and its Subsidiaries.  
Section 3.18. Seller Satellites.   (a) Section 3.18(a) of the Seller
Disclosure Schedule sets  forth a complete and accurate list of the
satellites owned by Seller or  any of its Subsidiaries (the "Seller
Satellites"). Seller has made  available to Purchaser true and correct copies
of the "Health Status  Reports" prepared by Seller\'s Engineering and
Operations Department  since January 1, 2002 (the "Health Status Reports").
As of the date  hereof, to Seller\'s Knowledge, there are no material Seller
Satellite  anomalies that are not disclosed in the Health Status Reports.
Seller  and its Subsidiaries have good title to the Seller Satellites, in
each  case free and clear of all Liens except Permitted Liens.   (b)
Section 3.18(b) of the Seller Disclosure Schedule sets  forth (i) a summary,
by orbital location, of the status of frequency  registration at the
International Telecommunication Union ("ITU"), of  each Seller Satellite and
each other orbital location identified in the  Dutch Permits, including ITU
coordination request reference numbers and  publication dates (or equivalent
information for advance publication  whenever coordination requests are still
unpublished), the identity of  the sponsoring administration and the
frequency bands authorized by the  AT, (ii) the dates Seller\'s ITU rights at
the orbital location for  which a satellite has not been brought into use
would expire and (iii)  a list, as of the date hereof, of all satellite
intersystem  coordination agreements to which Seller or any Subsidiary of
Seller is  a party. Except as have not had, and would not reasonably be
expected  to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse
Effect,  to Seller\'s Knowledge, no Person or entity has date precedence in 
filing a Request for Coordination in accordance with the ITU  regulations, or
has asserted that it has rights to operate a spacecraft  in a manner that
would result in interference to any Seller Satellite  or ground station.  
(c) Section 3.18(c) of the Seller Disclosure Schedule sets  forth all
material transmitting and/or receiving radio frequency  facilities consisting
of land, buildings, fixtures, equipment,  improvements (if any) and
telemetry, tracking and control equipment  that are owned or leased by Seller
or any of its Subsidiaries (the  "Seller Ground Stations") or that are
operated as of the date hereof by  Seller or any of its Subsidiaries (the
"Major Stations"). No ground  station other than a Major Station provides
telemetry, tracking and  control for a Seller Satellite. Except as have not
had, and would not  reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the
aggregate, a  Material Adverse Effect, the improvements to each Major Station
and all  components used in connection therewith are (i) in good operating 
condition and repair and are suitable for their intended purposes and  (ii)
supported by a back-up generator capable of generating power  sufficient to
meet the requirements of the operations conducted at the  Major Station. To
Seller\'s Knowledge, no other radio communications  facility is causing
objectionable interference to the transmissions  from or the receipt of
signals by any Seller Satellite or Seller Ground  Station, except for any
interferences that have not had, and would not  reasonably be expected to
have, individually or in the aggregate, a  Material Adverse Effect. Seller
and its Subsidiaries have good title  to, or in the case of leased property
or assets, a valid, binding and  enforceable leasehold interest in, all
Seller Ground Stations, in each  case free and clear of all Liens except
Permitted Liens.   Section 3.19. Related Party Transactions. As of the
date hereof, there is no transaction, agreement or arrangement between Seller
or any of its Subsidiaries on the one hand, and any Person on the other hand
that would constitute a "Related Transaction" within the meaning of Item 404
of Regulation S-K under the Exchange Act.   Section 3.20. Brokers. (a) No
broker, finder, investment banker, other intermediary or other Person (other
than Goldman Sachs International and NM Rothschild and Sons Limited) is
entitled to any brokerage, finder\'s or other fee or commission or expense
reimbursement in connection with the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement based upon arrangements made by or on behalf of Seller or any of
its Affiliates. A copy of the engagement agreement and any other agreements
between Seller or any of its Affiliates, on the one hand, and Goldman Sachs
International or NM Rothschild and Sons Limited, on the other hand, has been
provided to Parent.   (b) Schedule 3.20(b) of the Seller Disclosure Schedule
sets  forth Seller\'s reasonable estimate, as of the date hereof, of the 
Expenses incurred or payable, or to be incurred or payable, by Seller  or any
of its Subsidiaries in connection with this Agreement and the  consummation
of the transactions contemplated hereby.   Section 3.21. Real Property.  
(a) Section 3.21(a) of the Seller Disclosure Schedule contains  a list of the
Owned Property. Except as have not had, and would not  reasonably be expected
to have, individually or in the aggregate, a  Material Adverse Effect, to
Seller\'s Knowledge: (i) each of Seller and  its Subsidiaries has good and
marketable title to each parcel of Owned  Property free and clear of all
Liens, except for the Permitted Liens;  and (ii) none of the Owned Property
is owned jointly with any other  Person.   (b) Section 3.21(b) of the
Seller Disclosure Schedule contains  a list of all Leased Property. Seller
has previously made available to  Purchaser true, correct and complete copies
of all leases for the  Leased Property. To Seller\'s Knowledge, (i) Seller
and its Subsidiaries  have not received any notice from the other party to
such Lease of the  termination thereof and (ii) there is no default or event
which, with  notice or lapse of time or both, would constitute a default
under such  Lease on the part of Seller, except for any defaults and events
that do  not have, and would not reasonably be expected to have, individually
or  in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect.   (c) Except as have not
had, and would not reasonably be  expected to have, individually or in the
aggregate, a Material Adverse  Effect, there are no existing, or to Seller\'s
Knowledge, threatened,  condemnation or eminent domain proceedings affecting
the Owned Property  or any portion thereof.   (d) Except as have not had,
and would not reasonably be  expected to have, individually or in the
aggregate, a Material Adverse  Effect, the covenants, conditions, rights-of-
way, easements and similar  restrictions affecting any Owned Property do not,
in each case, impair  the ability to use such Owned Property in the operation
of the  Businesses as conducted on the date hereof.   (e) Except as have
not had, and would not reasonably be  expected to have, individually or in
the aggregate, a Material Adverse  Effect, neither Seller nor any of its
Subsidiaries is obligated under  or bound by any option, right of first
refusal, purchase contract or  other contractual right to sell, lease or
purchase any real property or  any portions thereof or interests therein.  
(f) Except as have not had, and would not reasonably be  expected to have,
individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse  Effect, the buildings
and other structures on the Owned Property are in  good and substantial
repair and fit for the purposes for which they are  presently used.  
Section 3.22. Opinion of Financial Advisor. Seller has received the opinion
of NM Rothschild and Sons Limited to the effect that, as of the date hereof,
the consideration to be received by the holders of Seller Shares in
connection with the Agreement is fair to such holders from a financial point
of view.   ARTICLE IV   REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF PARENT AND

facilities, (ii) cause the FCC to fail to approve in a timely fashion the

Litigation. As of the date hereof, there is no Action pending or, to the
knowledge of Parent, threatened, against any of Parent, the Parent
Significant Subsidiaries or Purchaser, which questions the validity of this

against Seller or any of its Subsidiaries.   Section 4.09. Financial
Ability. (a) Purchaser has received, accepted and agreed to (i) one or more

financing, the "Debt Financing") and (ii) valid and binding commitment letter
from certain Affiliates of Parent (the "Equity Financing Commitment Letter"),
committing them to provide to Purchaser equity financing for the transactions
contemplated hereby, subject to the terms and conditions set forth therein
(such equity financing, the "Equity Financing" and together with the Debt
Financing, the "Financing"). True and complete copies of the executed Debt
Financing Commitment Letter and the Equity Financing Commitment Letter have
been delivered to Seller on or prior to the date hereof.   (b) As of the
date hereof, the Debt Financing Commitment  Letter and the Equity Financing
Commitment Letter delivered to Seller  are in full force and effect and are
not subject to the execution and  delivery of any other Contracts.   (c)
The aggregate proceeds of the Financing will be sufficient  to pay the
Purchase Price, the Transfer Taxes payable pursuant to  Section 2.03 and all
fees and expenses required to be paid as a  condition to the consummation of
the Financing. No event has occurred  which, with or without notice, lapse of
time or both, would reasonably  be expected to constitute an event of default
on the part of Parent or  Purchaser under the Equity Financing Commitment
Letter or the Debt  Financing Commitment Letter that has not been waived or
remedied to the  satisfaction of the lenders under the Debt Financing
Commitment Letter,  within 30 days of the date of occurrence of such event of
default.  Parent has fully paid any and all commitment fees or other fees on
the  dates and to the extent required by the Equity Financing Commitment 
Letter and the Debt Financing Commitment Letter.   Section 4.10.

agents or representatives, except for those representations and warranties
contained in Article III of this Agreement.   ARTICLE V   COVENANTS

Purchaser in this Agreement, (i) which are qualified as to materiality,
untrue or incorrect or (ii) which are not so qualified, untrue in any

to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, each Party will use its
reasonable best efforts (except where a different efforts standard is
specifically contemplated by this Agreement, in which case such different
standard shall apply) to take, or cause to be taken, all actions and to do,
or cause to be done, and to assist and cooperate with each of the other
Parties to this Agreement in doing, all things necessary, proper or advisable
under applicable Law to consummate the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, as promptly as practicable, including (i) defending Actions
challenging this Agreement, the resolutions of the Seller Boards or the

hereby or the consummation of any of the transactions contemplated hereby,
including seeking to have any stay or temporary restraining order or

limitation of the foregoing, each Party agrees to make or cause to be made an
appropriate filing of all filings that are advisable or required
by applicable Antitrust Laws, the Communications Act, including the
rules, regulations and policies promulgated thereunder by the FCC, any
applicable Law of The Netherlands, any foreign investment Law and in
connection with any other Seller Required Approvals and Parent Required
Approvals with respect to the transactions contemplated hereby, as promptly
as practicable, and in no event later than 15 Business Days after the date
hereof, and to supply as promptly as practicable any additional information
and documentary material that may be requested pursuant to any applicable Law
of The Netherlands, the European Union, the United States or other Antitrust
Laws and use its reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all
other actions consistent with this Section 6.03 necessary to cause the
expiration or termination of the applicable waiting periods under any
applicable Law of The Netherlands, the European Union, the United States or
such other Laws as soon as practicable. Without limiting the foregoing, each
of the Parties shall request and shall use its reasonable best efforts to
obtain early termination of the waiting period provided for under the HSR
Act.   (b) Each of Parent and Seller shall, in connection with the  efforts
referenced in Section 6.03(a) to obtain all requisite approvals  and
authorizations for the transactions contemplated by this Agreement  under
applicable Antitrust Laws, the Communications Act, any applicable  law of The
Netherlands, any foreign investment Law and in connection  with any other
Seller Required Approvals and Parent Required Approvals,  use its reasonable
best efforts to (i) cooperate to prosecute each  application for approval
with reasonable diligence and otherwise use  their reasonable best efforts to
obtain the grants of the applications  as expeditiously as practicable,
including the exercise of reasonable  diligence to comply with any request
from the FCC or AT for additional  documents, information or materials; (ii)
cooperate in all respects  with the other Party in connection with any filing
or submission and in  connection with any investigation or other inquiry,
including any  proceeding initiated by a private party; (iii) notify the
other Party  promptly following any communication received by such Party
from, or  given by such Party to the AT, the Federal Trade Commission, the 
Antitrust Division of the Department of Justice, the FCC or any other 
Governmental Authority and of any communication received or given in 
connection with any proceeding by a private party and, in each case,  provide
the other Party with a copy of any written communication  promptly after the
receipt thereof; and (iv) oppose any petitions to  deny or other objections
filed with respect to the applications for any  FCC or AT approval, including
any administrative or judicial review and  any requests for reconsideration
or review of any FCC or AT approval,  in each case regarding any of the
transactions contemplated hereby.  Each Party agrees to comply with any
condition imposed on it (or its  Affiliates) by the FCC or AT in granting the
application for transfer  or assignment of the FCC or AT licenses, except
that no Party shall be  required to comply with a condition if compliance
with the condition  would reasonably be expected to have a material adverse
effect on  Parent or its Affiliates or have a Material Adverse Effect (other
than  any such conditions generally applicable to satellite space stations
or  earth station licensees within a relevant jurisdiction). Each of Parent 
and Purchaser shall take or cause to be taken all actions necessary, 
appropriate or desirable to be taken by Parent and Purchaser (and their 
respective Affiliates) to permit the FCC or AT to approve in a timely 
fashion the FCC or AT transfer or assignment application, except that 
neither Seller, its Affiliates, Parent, its Affiliates, nor Purchaser  shall
be required to take any action that would be reasonably likely to  have a
material adverse effect on Parent, its Affiliates, or Purchaser  or have a
Material Adverse Effect.   (c) In furtherance and not in limitation of the
covenants of  the Parties , contained in Sections 6.03(a) and 6.03(b), each
of Parent  and Seller shall use its reasonable best efforts to resolve such 
objections if any, as may be asserted by a Governmental Authority or  other
Person with respect to the transactions contemplated hereby,  under the
Communications Act, any applicable Law of The Netherlands,  any Antitrust Law
or any foreign investment Law. In connection with the  foregoing, if any
administrative or judicial action or proceeding,  including any proceeding by
a private party, is instituted (or  threatened to be instituted) challenging
any transaction contemplated  by this Agreement as violative of the
Communications Act, any  applicable Law of The Netherlands, any Antitrust Law
or any foreign  investment Law, each of the Parties shall cooperate in all
respects  with the other Parties and use its respective reasonable best
efforts  to contest and resist any such action or proceeding and to have 
vacated, lifted, reversed or overturned any decree, judgment,  injunction or
other order, whether temporary, preliminary or permanent,  that is in effect
and that prohibits, prevents or restricts  consummation of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement.  Notwithstanding the foregoing or any other
provision of this Agreement,  nothing in this Section 6.03 shall (i) limit a
Party\'s right to  terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 10.02(a) or
(c) so long as  such Party has theretofore complied in all material respects
with its  obligations under this Section 6.03, (ii) require Parent to agree
to  any conditions which would impose (A) any limitations on Parent\'s 
ownership or operation of all or any material portion of Seller\'s or  any of
its Subsidiaries\' or Purchaser\'s or Affiliates\' business or  assets, or to
compel Parent or any of its Subsidiaries to dispose of or  hold separate all
or any material portion of Seller\'s or any of its  Subsidiaries\' business
or assets, (B) any obligations on Parent or any  of its Subsidiaries or
Seller or any of its Subsidiaries to maintain  facilities, operations, places
of business, employment levels, products  or businesses or (C) any other
obligation, restriction, limitation,  qualification or other conditions,
which, in the case of any of clauses  (A) through (C) above, would,
individually or in the aggregate,  reasonably be expected to have a material
adverse effect on Purchaser  or any of its Affiliates or have a Material
Adverse Effect or (iii)  require Seller to agree to any dispositions,
limitations, consents,  commitments, agreements or other actions, other than
any disposition,  limitation, consent, commitment agreement or other action
that in each  such case may be conditioned upon the consummation of the
transactions  contemplated by this Agreement.   (d) For the avoidance of
doubt, the covenants of the Parties  contained in Sections 6.03(a) and
6.03(b) shall apply to notifications,  filings, agreements, or approvals
required or advisable to be made  with, entered into, or obtained from the
U.S. Department of State  (Directorate of Defense Trade Controls, Bureau of
Political-Military  Affairs), CFIUS under Exon-Florio, or the U.S. federal
executive branch  agencies with responsibility for law enforcement or
homeland security.   (e) Parent and Purchaser shall not, without the prior
written  consent of Seller, which consent Seller shall not unreasonably
withhold  or delay:   (i) take any action which would or is reasonably
likely  to (A) adversely affect the ability of Parent or  Purchaser to
obtain any necessary approvals of any  Governmental Authority required for
the transactions  contemplated hereby; (B) adversely affect Parent\'s  or
Purchaser\'s ability to perform its covenants and  agreements under this
Agreement; or (C) result in  any of the conditions to the performance of
the  Parties\' obligations hereunder not being satisfied;  or   (ii) agree
or make any commitment to take any actions  prohibited by this Section
6.03(e).   (f) Seller shall provide reasonable notice and consult with 
Parent in the event that, after the date hereof, Seller continues 
negotiations in connection with the renewal or replacement of the  Credit
Agreement.   Section 6.04. Acquisition Proposals. (a) Seller will not,
and will cause its Subsidiaries and each officer, director, employee,
consultant, financial advisor, auditor, investment banker, attorney,
accountant, agent or other advisor or representative (collectively, the
"Representatives") of Seller or any of its Subsidiaries not to, directly or
indirectly, (i) solicit, initiate, facilitate or encourage (including by way
of furnishing information) the making by any Person (other than the parties
hereto) of any Acquisition Proposal; (ii) participate in any discussions or
negotiations regarding, or furnish to any Person any information with respect
to or in connection with, or take any other action to facilitate, any
Acquisition Proposal or any inquiries with respect to, or the making of any
proposal that constitutes, or may reasonably be expected to lead to, any
Acquisition Proposal; or (iii) enter into any agreement, understanding or
arrangement with respect to an Acquisition Proposal, or approve or recommend
or propose to approve or recommend any Acquisition Proposal or any agreement,
arrangement or understanding relating to an Acquisition Proposal (or resolve
or authorize or propose to agree to do any of the foregoing); provided that,
nothing contained in this Section 6.04(a) shall prohibit Seller from
furnishing information to, or entering into discussions or negotiations with,
any Person that makes an unsolicited bona fide Acquisition Proposal, if (i)
the Seller Boards determine in good faith that such Acquisition Proposal is
reasonably likely to lead to a Superior Proposal, (ii) to the extent such
Person enters into a confidentiality and/or standstill agreement with Seller
on terms in substance less favorable to Seller or more favorable to such
Person than the corresponding terms of the Confidentiality Agreement (the
"Revised Confidentiality Terms"), Seller provides Parent with a copy of the
Revised Confidentiality Terms and agrees that the corresponding terms of the
Confidentiality Agreement shall, if so requested by the Affiliates of Parent
which are parties thereto, be amended (including, if there are
no corresponding Revised Confidentiality Terms, by deleting the relevant
provisions of the Confidentiality Agreement) so that they are substantially
similar to the Revised Confidentiality Terms and (iii) the Required Seller
Vote has not yet been obtained. Seller shall notify Parent of having received
any written Acquisition Proposal (and provide a copy thereof) and any other
Acquisition Proposal with respect to which it proposes to take the actions
permitted by clauses (i) and (ii) in the proviso to the preceding sentence
promptly, and in any event no later than two Business Days after its receipt
thereof, and shall keep Parent reasonably informed on a current basis as to
the status of any discussions and negotiations subject to applicable Law.
Immediately after the execution and delivery of this Agreement, Seller will,
and will cause its Subsidiaries, and its and their Representatives to, cease
and terminate any existing activities, discussions or negotiations with any
Persons conducted heretofore with respect to any possible Acquisition
Proposal unless such Persons makes an unsolicited Acquisition Proposal and
Seller has complied with the provisions of this Section 6.04(a) in all
material respects. Nothing in this Section 6.04 shall permit Seller to
terminate this Agreement or affect any other obligations of Seller under this
Agreement (except as specifically provided in Sections 10.03(b)). "Superior
Proposal" shall mean an unsolicited Acquisition Proposal with respect to
which the Seller Boards have determined in good faith, after consultation
with their financial advisors and legal advisors and taking into account all
relevant factors, including the identity of the offeror and all legal,
financial, regulatory and other aspects of the proposal, including the terms
of any financing, that (x) if accepted, such Acquisition Proposal
would result in a transaction more favorable from a financial point of view
to Seller\'s shareholders than the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement and (y) is reasonably capable of being consummated.   (b) The
Seller Boards will not withdraw, modify or amend, or  propose to withdraw,
modify or amend, in any manner adverse to Parent,  their respective
recommendations that Seller shareholders vote in favor  of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement (or publicly  announce any intention to do so)
unless (i) an unsolicited bona fide  written Superior Proposal is pending at
the time the Seller Boards  determine to take any such action, (ii) Seller
shall have complied in  all material respects with this Section 6.04, and
(iii) Seller shall  have notified Parent at least five Business Days in
advance of its  intention to effect such withdrawal, modification or
amendment and  shall have negotiated in good faith with Parent during such
five  Business Day period (to the extent Parent desires to negotiate) to
make  adjustments in the terms and conditions of this Agreement such that 
such proposal would no longer be determined in good faith by the Seller 
Boards to constitute a Superior Proposal.   (c) Notwithstanding anything in
this Agreement to the  contrary, nothing shall prohibit Seller or the Seller
Boards from  communicating to its shareholders a position with respect to
any  Acquisition Proposal to the extent required by applicable Law or from 
making such disclosure to the Seller shareholders which the Seller  Boards
determine is otherwise required under applicable Law.   Section 6.05. Public
Announcements. Each of Parent and Seller will consult with the other and
provide the other with a reasonable opportunity to comment thereon, before
issuing any press release, making any filing with the SEC or the FCC or
otherwise making any public statements with respect to this Agreement or the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the Confidentiality Agreement
and shall not issue any such press release, make any such SEC or FCC filing
or make any such public statement prior to such consultation, except as may
be required by applicable Law, the Seller Articles or under any listing
agreement or applicable rules of any securities exchange.   Section 6.06.
Indemnification; Directors\' and Officers\' Insurance. (a) Each of Parent and
Purchaser agrees that all rights to exculpation and indemnification for acts
or omissions in favor of the current or former directors (including in their
capacity of members of any committee of the Boards), members of Seller\'s
executive management committee or officers of Seller occurring prior to or at
the Closing Date (the "Indemnified Parties") as provided in the Seller
Articles or in any agreement listed in the Seller Disclosure Schedule shall
continue in full force and effect in accordance with their terms from the
Closing Date until the expiration of the applicable statute of limitations
with respect to any claims against such directors or officers arising out of
such acts or omissions and all exculpation and indemnification obligations of
Seller for acts or omissions occurring prior to or at the Closing Date set
forth in the Seller Articles or in any agreement listed in the
Seller Disclosure Schedule shall be assumed by Purchaser from and after the
Closing and shall constitute Assumed Liabilities. For the avoidance of doubt,
all obligations of Seller to the Indemnified Parties for acts or omissions
occurring prior to or at the Closing Date shall constitute Assumed
Liabilities under this Agreement .   (b) For a period of six years after
the Closing Date, Parent  shall cause to be maintained in effect policies of
at least the same  coverage as the policies of directors\' and officers\'
liability  insurance maintained by Seller for the benefit of those persons
who are  covered by such policies on the Closing Date with respect to
matters  occurring at or prior to the Closing Date, to the extent that such 
liability insurance can be maintained at a cost to Parent not greater  than
300 percent of the last annual premium for the current Seller  directors\'
and officers\' liability insurance as set forth in the Seller  Disclosure
Schedule; provided that, if such insurance cannot be so  maintained or
obtained at such costs, Parent shall cause Purchaser to  maintain or obtain
as much of such insurance as can be so maintained or  obtained (not to exceed
six years from the Closing Date) at a cost  equal to 300 percent of the last
annual premium of Seller for such  insurance.   (c) Without limiting
Parent\'s or Purchaser\'s obligations under  Section 6.06(a), from and after
the Closing Date, to the fullest extent  permitted by Law, each of Parent and
Purchaser shall indemnify, defend  and hold harmless each Indemnified Party,
to the same extent as  provided in the Seller Articles on the date hereof,
and the Liquidator  against all Losses to the extent arising from, relating
to, or  otherwise in respect of, any actual or threatened Action in respect
of  actions or omissions occurring at or prior to the Closing Date in 
connection with such Indemnified Party\'s duties as an officer or  director
of Seller or any of its Subsidiaries or the Liquidator\'s  duties pursuant to
the Seller Liquidation, including in respect to this  Agreement and the
transactions contemplated hereby; provided, however,  that no Indemnified
Party nor the Liquidator shall be entitled to  indemnification under this
Section 6.06(c) for Losses arising out of  actions or omissions by such
Indemnified Party or the Liquidator, as  the case may be, constituting (i) a
material breach of this Agreement,  (ii) criminal conduct, (iii) any material
violation of national, state  or foreign securities laws or (iv) any action
taken in bad faith. In  the event of any Loss described in the preceding
sentence, (i)  Purchaser shall pay the reasonable fees and expenses of
counsel  selected by the Indemnified Parties or the Liquidator (and
reasonably  acceptable to Purchaser) on a monthly basis promptly after
statements  are received in advance of settlement, judgment or other
resolution  thereof to such Indemnified Party or the Liquidator, as the case
may  be, upon request (provided such Indemnified Party or the Liquidator,
as  applicable, provides an undertaking to repay all advanced expenses if 
it is ultimately determined that such Person is not entitled to 
indemnification) and (ii) Purchaser shall cooperate in the defense of  any
such matter; provided that Purchaser shall not be obligated  pursuant to this
Section 6.06(c) to pay the fees and expenses of more  than one counsel for
all Indemnified Parties in any jurisdiction  (selected by a plurality of the
applicable Indemnified Parties) with  respect to any single action except to
the extent that two or more of  such Indemnified Parties shall have
conflicting interests in the  outcome of such action. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, neither Parent  nor Purchaser shall have any obligations to an
Indemnified Party or to  the Liquidator with respect to (i) any Retained
Liabilities or (ii) an  Action pending in front of a court of competent
jurisdiction if such  court shall determine that indemnification of such
Person in the manner  contemplated hereby is prohibited by applicable Law and
such  determination shall have become final and non-appealable.   Section
6.07. Notification of Certain Matters. Seller shall, upon obtaining knowledge
of any of the following, give prompt notice to Parent, and Parent shall, upon
obtaining knowledge of any of the following, give prompt notice to Seller, of
(i) the occurrence or non-occurrence of any event the occurrence or non-
occurrence of which would reasonably be likely to cause any representation or
warranty of such Party contained in this Agreement, which is qualified as to
materiality, to be untrue or inaccurate, or any representation or warranty of
such Party not so qualified, to be untrue or inaccurate in any material
respect, at or prior to the Closing Date, (ii) any failure in any material
respect of any of Seller, Parent or Purchaser, as the case may be, to comply
with or satisfy any covenant, condition or agreement to be complied with or
satisfied by it hereunder, (iii) the occurrence or non-occurrence of
any event the occurrence or non-occurrence of which would be likely to cause
any condition to the obligations of any Party to effect the
transactions contemplated hereby not to be satisfied, (iv) any notice or
other written communication from any Governmental Authority in connection
with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, (v) any Actions (or
communications indicating that the same may be contemplated) commenced or
threatened against any of Seller, Parent or Purchaser, as the case may be, or
any of their respective Subsidiaries which, if pending on the date hereof,
would have been required to have been disclosed pursuant to Section 3.10 or
Section 4.06 or which relate to the consummation of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement or (vi) any notice or other communication from
any third party alleging that the consent of such third party is or may be
required in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement;
provided that, the delivery of any notice pursuant to this Section 6.07 shall
not cure such breach or non-compliance or limit or otherwise affect the
rights or remedies available hereunder to the Party receiving such notice.
Seller shall consult with Parent, and consider reasonable requests made by
Parent, regarding the attachment of Seller Shares held by certain customers
of Seller in connection with debt collection proceedings against such
customers.   Section 6.08. Regulatory Filings. Seller shall furnish
to Parent copies of all reports and other documents which it files with the
Trade Register, the AFM, Euronext, the SER, the SEC, the NYSE, the AT, the
Dutch Ministry of Economic Affairs, or the FCC on or after the date hereof,
and Seller represents and warrants that as of the respective dates thereof,
such reports and other documents will not contain any untrue statement of a
material fact or omit to state a material fact required to be stated therein
or necessary to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances
under which they were made, not misleading. With respect to filings with the
AT, the Dutch Ministry of Economic Affairs and the FCC, the obligation to
provide documents to Parent shall not include, in the case of the FCC,
filings in proceedings of general applicability, and in the case of the AT or
the Dutch Ministry of Economic Affairs, routine preliminary coordination
documents and documents not directly related to the Dutch Permits. Seller
shall provide to Parent periodic oral reports on the status of coordination
efforts. The audited consolidated financial statements and unaudited
consolidated interim financial statements included in such reports (including
any related notes and schedules) will comply as to form in all material
respects with applicable accounting requirements, Dutch and foreign
applicable Laws and the published rules and regulations of Euronext, the AFM,
the SEC, the NYSE and the FCC with respect thereto and will fairly present,
in conformity with U.S. GAAP applied on a consistent basis (except as
specifically indicated in the notes thereto), the consolidated financial
position of Seller and its consolidated Subsidiaries as of the dates thereof
and their consolidated results of operations and cash flows for the periods
then ended. Seller\'s obligation with respect to the FCC filings
or information shall be limited to publicly available information and shall
not require disclosure of confidential information.   Section 6.09.
Expenses. All Expenses incurred in connection with this Agreement and the
transactions contemplated hereby shall be paid by the Party incurring such
Expenses and, following the Closing, all Expenses of Seller incurred prior to
or as of the Closing and not theretofore paid shall constitute Assumed
Liabilities.   Section 6.10. Financing. (a) Each of Parent and
Purchaser shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to obtain the Debt
Financing on the terms and conditions described in the Debt Financing
Commitment Letter, including using commercially reasonable efforts to (i)
negotiate definitive agreements with respect thereto on terms and conditions
contained therein (or otherwise on terms and conditions which do not reduce
the aggregate amount of the Debt Financing or amend the conditions to the
drawdown of the Debt Financing or are adverse to the interests of Seller in
any other respect), (ii) satisfy all conditions applicable to Parent and
Purchaser in such definitive agreements that are within its control, (iii)
comply with its obligations under the Debt Financing Commitment Letter, (iv)
enforce its rights under the Debt Financing Commitment Letter and (v) in the
event the Debt Financing Commitment Letter is terminated prior to the
Closing, obtain a renewal of, or a substitute for, the Debt Financing
Commitment Letter on terms and conditions comparable in all material respects
to the terms and conditions contemplated in the Debt Financing Commitment
Letter or on more favorable terms to Purchaser. In the event any portion of
the Debt Financing becomes unavailable on terms and conditions comparable in
all material respects to the terms and conditions contemplated in the Debt
Financing Commitment Letter, Parent and Purchaser shall use
their commercially reasonable efforts to arrange to obtain any such portion
from alternative sources on comparable or more favorable terms to
Purchaser. Purchaser shall give Seller prompt notice of it becoming aware of
any material breach by any party of the Debt Financing Commitment Letter or
any termination of the Debt Financing Commitment Letter. Parent shall keep
Seller informed on a reasonable basis in reasonable detail of the status of
its efforts to arrange the Financing and shall not permit any amendment or
modification to be made to, or any waiver of any material provision or remedy
under, the Equity Financing Commitment Letter or the Debt Financing
Commitment Letter if such amendment, modification, waiver or remedy reduces
the aggregate amount of the Financing, amends the conditions to the drawdown
of the Financing or is adverse to the interests of Seller in any other
respect.   (b) Seller agrees to provide, and shall cause its Subsidiaries 
and its and their respective Representatives to provide, all reasonable 
cooperation reasonably in connection with the arrangement of the Debt 
Financing as may be reasonably requested by Parent (provided that such 
requested cooperation does not unreasonably interfere with the ongoing 
operations of Seller and its Subsidiaries), including (i) participation  in
meetings, drafting sessions, due diligence sessions, management  presentation
sessions and sessions with rating agencies, (ii)  furnishing Parent and its
financing sources with financial and other  pertinent information regarding
Seller as may be reasonably requested  by Parent (including projections and
financial statements), (iii)  assisting Parent and its financing sources in
the preparation of (A) an  offering document for any debt raised to complete
the transactions  contemplated by this Agreement and (B) materials for rating
agency  presentations, (iv) reasonably cooperating with the marketing
efforts  of Parent and its financing sources for any debt raised by Parent
to  complete the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including by 
participating in road shows, and (v) providing and executing documents, 
including a certificate of the chief financial officer of Seller with 
respect to solvency matters, comfort letters of accountants, consents  of
accountants for use of their reports in any materials relating to  the Debt
Financing and legal opinions, as may be reasonably requested  by Parent;
provided that, none of Seller or any of its Subsidiaries or  Affiliates shall
be required to pay any commitment or other similar fee  or incur any other
Liability in connection with the Debt Financing  (other than Liabilities to
be incurred by Subsidiaries of Seller at the  Closing). Parent shall,
promptly upon request by Seller, reimburse  Seller for all reasonable out-of-
pocket costs and expenses incurred by  Seller or any of its Subsidiaries in
connection with such cooperation.  Parent and Purchaser shall, on a joint and
several basis, indemnify and  hold harmless Seller and its Subsidiaries and
their respective  Representatives for and against any and all Losses suffered
or incurred  by them in connection with the arrangement of the Debt Financing
and  any information utilized in connection therewith.   Section 6.11.
Further Assurances. From and after the Closing Date, each of the Parties
shall execute and deliver such documents and other papers and take such
further actions as may reasonably be required to carry out the provisions of
this Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements and give effect to the
transactions contemplated hereby and thereby, including the execution
and delivery of such assignments, deeds and other documents as may be
necessary to transfer any Assets as provided in this Agreement. Without
limiting the foregoing, from and after the Closing (i) Seller shall (and
shall cause its Subsidiaries to) do all things necessary, proper or advisable
under applicable Law as requested by Parent to put Purchaser in effective
possession, ownership and control of the Assets and Parent and Purchaser
shall cooperate with Seller for such purpose and (ii) each of Parent and
Purchaser shall do all things necessary, proper and advisable under
applicable Law as requested by Seller (A) to transfer to Seller (or such
other Person as Seller shall indicate) any Excluded Assets that Purchaser may
possess and (B) to assure that Purchaser, rather than Seller or any of its
Subsidiaries, is the obligor in respect of all Assumed Liabilities, and
Seller shall cooperate with Purchaser for such purposes.   Section 6.12.
Seller Liquidation. (a) Each of Parent and Purchaser shall use its reasonable
best efforts to (i) assist Seller to effect the Seller Liquidation and take
all actions reasonably requested by Seller for such purpose, including by
granting Seller and its Affiliates reasonable access to the Assets and
providing such other assistance as Seller may reasonably request; and (ii)
assist Seller to effect the Distribution as soon as practicable after the
Closing and prior to the commencement of the opposition period related to the
Seller Liquidation, including by undertaking to pay or discharge all
outstanding debts, liabilities and claims that are Assumed Liabilities that
may arise in connection with the Seller Liquidation.   (b) Seller shall use
the Retained Cash Amount to pay, perform  and discharge any obligations and
liabilities that arise in connection  with the Seller Liquidation. Seller
shall distribute, or cause to be  distributed, any part of the Retained Cash
Amount that remains  available as of the consummation of the Seller
Liquidation to an  account designated by Purchaser no later than two Business
Days  following the consummation of the Seller Liquidation.   Section 6.13.
Ancillary Agreements. On the Closing Date, each of Purchaser and Seller shall
execute and deliver each of the Ancillary Agreements to which it is a party
if such Ancillary Agreement has not been executed on the date hereof.  
Section 6.14. Work-around Undertaking. Without prejudice to the respective
rights of the parties under Section 6.03 and without limiting any of their
respective obligations under Section 6.03 with respect to periods following
the Closing, Seller and Purchaser shall cooperate in entering into lawful
arrangements from and after the Closing to provide that Purchaser
shall receive the benefits of all Assets, and be responsible for all
Assumed Liabilities, under each Permit (including Permits the transfer of
which is prohibited by applicable Law) and Contract under which the Assets
will not be transferred at Closing free and clear of Liens (other than
Permitted Liens) or under which the Liabilities will not be fully
transferred, in either case as the result of the failure to obtain a consent
or approval or make a filing of notification. Nothing in this Agreement shall
be construed as an attempt to transfer any Asset that is by its terms non-
transferable without the consent of another party.   ARTICLE VII  
EMPLOYEE MATTERS   Section 7.01. Assignment by Operation of Law. The
Parties acknowledge, agree and accept that this Agreement qualifies as the
transfer of an undertaking under section 7:662-666 of the Dutch Civil Code
(Burgerlijk Wetboek) ("DCC"). According to section 7:663 DCC, the following
actions will occur by operation of law: (a) The employees who are on the
employment rolls of Seller immediately prior to the Closing Date and who are
subject to the DCC will leave the employment of Seller and will enter the
employment of Purchaser effective as of the Closing Date (the "Transferred
Seller Employees"); and   (b) The terms and conditions of employment of the
Transferred  Seller Employees with Purchaser will be identical, in full
scope, to  the terms and conditions of employment of the Transferred Seller 
Employees with Seller immediately prior to the Closing Date.   Section 7.02.
Dutch Pension Plans. The Transferred Seller Employees are participants in the
pension plan arranged by Seller (the "Seller Pension Plan"), provided by ABN-
AMRO Levensverzekering N.V. (the "Seller Pension Provider"). Purchaser shall
arrange an identical pension plan (the "Purchaser Pension Plan" and a pension
provider ("pensioenuitvoerder", the "Purchaser Pension Provider") to be in
place at the Closing Date upon terms and conditions that do not result in any
adverse effect or reduction in the aggregate benefits that the Transferred
Seller Employees are eligible to accrue compared to the benefits which they
would have been eligible to accrue had their participation in the Seller
Pension Plan continued uninterrupted. Seller and Purchaser shall use all
reasonable efforts to transfer, effective as of the Closing Date, from Seller
to Purchaser all contractual obligations and liabilities of Seller towards
the Seller Pension Provider, in relation to the Seller Pension
Plan. Purchaser shall offer the Transferred Seller Employees the opportunity
to participate in the Purchaser Pension Plan effective as of the Closing
Date.   Section 7.03. Other Employees. With respect to employees of Seller
who are not subject to the DCC and employees of Subsidiaries
("Other Employees"):   (a) For a period of not less than twelve (12) months
following  the Closing, Purchaser shall provide or cause to be provided to
the  Other Employees in each jurisdiction in which such Other Employees are 
employed compensation and employee benefit plans, considered in the 
aggregate, that are comparable in all material respects to the level of 
compensation and employee benefits (other than equity-based  compensation)
provided to the Other Employees immediately prior to the  Closing.   (b) In
addition to and without limitation on paragraph (a)  hereof, Purchaser shall
provide for a period of twelve (12) months  after the Closing Date, severance
benefits that are comparable in all  material respects to the severance
benefits provided to the Other  Employees immediately prior to the Closing
Date.   (c) In addition to and without limitation on paragraph (a)  hereof,
Purchaser shall adopt or assume, as applicable, or shall cause  the
Subsidiaries and any successor of any of them to adopt or assume,  effective
as of the Closing, pension plans and programs for Other  Employees on terms
and conditions that do not result in any adverse  effect or reduction in
aggregate pension benefits to Other Employees  compared to the benefits which
they would have been eligible to accrue  had their participation in the
pension plans in which they were  participants immediately prior to the
Closing continued uninterrupted  following the Closing. Without limitation on
the foregoing, Purchaser  shall assume, or shall cause the Subsidiaries or
any successor of any  of them to assume, sponsorship of, and any liabilities
or other  obligations relating to, any insurance contracts, trust agreements,
or  other funding vehicles relating to any pension plans or programs 
covering Other Employees and in effect immediately prior to the Closing 
Date. Nothing in this paragraph is intended to prevent or in any way  limit
the ability of Purchaser following the Closing Date to terminate  or amend
any such plan in accordance with its terms.   Section 7.04. Works Council
Advice. Section 7.04 of the Seller Disclosure Schedule contains a copy of the
letter, dated June 4, 2004, delivered to Seller by its interim works council
expressing the advice of that body with respect to this Agreement and the
transactions contemplated hereby. Parent and Purchaser accept, and undertake
to fulfill or comply with, each of the conditions to such advice set forth in
such letter.   ARTICLE VIII   TAX MATTERS   Section 8.01. Transfer
Taxes. Purchaser shall be responsible for and pay, and indemnify and hold
Seller and its Subsidiaries harmless from, any and all Transfer Taxes imposed
by any Governmental Authority in connection with the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement. In the event that any such Transfer Taxes are
required under applicable Law to be collected, remitted or paid by Seller or
any of its Subsidiaries or any agent thereof (as requested by Seller or any
of its Subsidiaries), Purchaser shall (on behalf of itself and of its
applicable Subsidiaries) pay the amount of such Transfer Taxes to Seller, any
of its Subsidiaries or any such agent, as applicable, at the Closing
or thereafter, as applicable, as requested of or by Seller, in addition to
the Purchase Price.   Section 8.02. Tax Indemnification. (a) Purchaser
shall be responsible for and pay, and indemnify and hold Seller harmless
from, any and all Tax liabilities of Seller with respect to the Business and
the Assets due to any taxing authority for any Pre-Closing Tax Period (as
well as amounts relating to the Pre-Closing Tax Period described in Section
8.02(c) but excluding any amounts indemnified under Section 8.01), other than
Tax liabilities (i) that are Retained Liabilities pursuant to Section 2.02(b)
or (ii) that arise directly or indirectly as a result of a carry-back of Tax
losses from a Post-Closing Tax Period to a Pre-Closing Tax Period due to a
disallowance of such Tax losses or otherwise; provided, however, that this
clause (ii) of this Section 8.02(a) does not limit Purchaser\'s obligation to
pay Seller for the use of Seller\'s items of loss or credit that arise in a
Straddle Period and are attributable to the Post-Closing Tax Period (pursuant
to Section 8.02(c)), for which Purchaser has agreed to indemnify Seller for
under this Section 8.02(a).   (b) Seller shall be responsible for and pay,
and indemnify and  hold Purchaser harmless from, any and all Tax liabilities
that are  Retained Liabilities pursuant to Section 2.02(b) (including, for
the  avoidance of doubt, Tax liabilities of Seller for any Post-Closing Tax 
Period).   (c) Purchaser and Seller agree that any allocation of income  or
deductions required to determine any Taxes attributable to any  Straddle
Period shall be made by means of a closing of the books and  records of
Seller at the Closing; (i) the amount of Taxes that would be  payable for any
Pre-Closing Tax Period, assuming the Seller\'s taxable  period, in fact,
ended at the Closing (other than Tax liabilities that  are or would be
Retained Liabilities pursuant to Section 2.02(b)) will  be treated as a Tax
liability of Seller which Purchaser shall be  responsible for and pay, and
indemnify and hold Seller harmless from  pursuant to Section 8.02(a), (ii)
the amount of taxes that would be  payable for any Post-Closing Tax Period,
assuming Seller\'s taxable  period, in fact, ended at the Closing, will be
treated as a Tax  liability of Seller which Seller shall be responsible for
and pay, and  indemnify and hold Purchaser harmless from pursuant to Section
8.02(b),  (iii) the amounts of taxes under (i) and (ii) will be determined 
without taking into account any net aggregate loss that would be  treated as
arising from the Pre-Closing Period or the Post-Closing  Period assuming the
books and records are closed at the Closing as  described above.   (d)
Payment of any amount due under this Section 8.02 shall be  made within 30
days following written notice by the other party that  payment of such
amounts to the appropriate taxing authority is due. In  the case of a Tax
that is contested in accordance with the provisions  of Section 8.03, payment
of Tax to the appropriate taxing authority  will not be considered to be due
earlier than the date a final  determination to such effect is made by the
appropriate taxing  authority or a court.   (e) If the receipt or accrual
of any indemnity payments  pursuant to this Agreement (including for the
avoidance of doubt,  payments pursuant to Section 8.01) results in taxable
income to the  indemnified party, such payment shall be increased by the
indemnifying  party so that, after the payment of any Taxes with respect to
the  receipt or accrual of the payment, the indemnified party shall have 
realized the same net amount it would have realized had the payment not 
resulted in taxable income. Purchaser and Seller shall timely and  properly
claim all deductions, credits or other Tax benefits that  result from any
such payment or in respect of an Assumed Liability or  Retained Liability,
unless otherwise required by applicable Law. To the  extent an Assumed
Liability or Retained Liability, as applicable, gives  rise to a deduction,
credit or other Tax benefit to the indemnified  party, the amount of any
indemnity payment made by the indemnifying  party to the indemnified party
under this Agreement shall be decreased  by the amount of the reduction in
Taxes actually realized by the  indemnified party as a result of such
deduction, credit or other Tax  benefit. If a reduction in Taxes of the
indemnified party occurs in a  taxable period following the period in which
the indemnification  payment is made, the indemnified party shall promptly
repay the  indemnifying party the amount of such reduction when actually
realized.   Section 8.03. Procedures Relating to Indemnification of
Tax Claims. (a) If, after the Closing Date, an audit, investigation,
discussion with any taxing authority or similar proceeding with respect to
Tax matters (the "Tax Proceeding") shall have previously been initiated,
shall be commenced, or a claim shall be made, by any taxing authority, which
might result in an indemnity pursuant to Section 8.02, the party receiving
notice of such Tax Proceeding shall promptly notify the other party in
writing of such Tax Proceeding; provided, however, that failure to give such
notice shall not affect the indemnification obligations under Section 8.02,
unless such failure materially prejudices the indemnifying party.   (b)
With respect to any Tax Proceeding which might result in  an indemnity
payment pursuant to Section 8.02(a), after the Closing  Date Purchaser shall
have the right to control all proceedings taken in  connection with such Tax
Proceeding (including selection of counsel)  and, without limiting the
foregoing, may with the consent of the other  party (which consent shall not
be unreasonably withheld) pursue or  forego any and all administrative
appeals, proceedings, hearings and  conferences with any taxing authority
with respect thereto, and may, in  its reasonable discretion, either pay the
Tax claimed and sue for a  refund where applicable Law permits such refund
suits or contest the  Tax Proceeding in any permissible manner.   (c) With
respect to any Tax Proceeding which might result in  an indemnity payment
pursuant to Section 8.02(b), the Seller shall have  the right to control all
proceedings taken in connection with such Tax  Proceeding (including
selection of counsel) and, without limiting the  foregoing, may with the
consent of the other party (which consent shall  not be unreasonably
withheld) pursue or forego any and all  administrative appeals, proceedings,
hearings and conferences with any  taxing authority with respect thereto, and
may, in its reasonable  discretion, either pay the Tax claimed and sue for a
refund where  applicable Law permits such refund suits or contest the Tax
Proceeding  in any permissible manner.   (d) With respect to any Tax
Proceeding which might result in  an indemnity payment pursuant to Section
8.02(a) or Section 8.02(b) (a  "Joint Tax Proceeding"), after the Closing
Date Purchaser and Seller  shall jointly control, and each shall have the
right to participate in  all activities and strategic decisions with respect
to such Joint Tax  Proceedings at their own expense. There shall be no
settlement or  closing or other agreement with respect to a Joint Tax
Proceeding  without the consent of the other party, which consent will not
be  unreasonably withheld; provided, however, that if either party shall 
refuse to consent to any settlement, closing or other agreement that  the
other party proposed to accept (a "Proposed Settlement"), then (a)  the
liability with respect to the subject matter of the Proposed  Settlement of
the party who proposed to accept the Proposed Settlement  shall be limited to
the amount that such liability would have been to  that party if the Proposed
Settlement has been accepted, and (b) the  other party shall be responsible
for all expenses incurred thereafter  in connection with the contest of such
Joint Tax Proceeding except to  the extent that the final settlement imposes
less liability on the  party who proposed to accept the Proposed Settlement
than the Proposed  Settlement would have imposed, in which case such party
shall be  responsible for a portion of such expenses equal to the lesser of
(i)  50% of such expenses and (ii) the amount by which the liability
imposed  on such party by the final settlement is less than that which
would  have been imposed by the Proposed Settlement. Either Purchaser or 
Seller may assume sole control of any Joint Tax Proceeding if it 
acknowledges in writing that it has sole responsibility for any Tax 
liabilities that might arise in such Joint Tax Proceeding.   (e)
Notwithstanding the foregoing, with respect to a Tax  Proceeding which
relates to the basis of Seller\'s assets for Dutch  corporate income tax
purposes as set forth on the Opening Tax Balance  Sheet, following the date
of this Agreement until the Closing Date,  Seller shall regularly consult
with Purchaser regarding all material  activities and all strategic decisions
of and relating to such Tax  Proceedings prior to undertaking such activities
or strategic decisions  and shall take account of, reflect, or implement all
of the Purchaser\'s  comments and suggestions that Seller reasonably
determines appropriate.  For the avoidance of doubt, nothing in this Section
8.03(e) shall limit  or modify the parties rights or obligations under
section 5.01(j) or  (k). Seller and Purchaser shall each bear its own
expenses relating to  the matters described in this section.   Section
8.04. Filing of Tax Returns. (a) Purchaser shall prepare or cause to be
prepared and Seller shall timely file or cause to be timely filed Seller\'s
Tax Returns for any Pre-Closing Tax Period (other than a Straddle Period
Return) due after the Closing Date. Seller shall prepare or cause to be
prepared and timely file or cause to be filed timely its Tax Returns for any
Post-Closing Tax Period that are required to be filed.   (b) Seller\'s Tax
Returns for any Straddle Period shall be  prepared in a manner consistent
with prior practice. Seller will allow  Purchaser (i) an opportunity to
review and comment upon any Tax Return  for any Straddle Period (including
any amended Tax Return for any  Straddle Period) with respect to any item
that may result in an  indemnity payment pursuant to Section 8.02(a) or which
could reasonably  be anticipated to have a Material Adverse Effect on a Post-
Closing Tax  Period with respect to the Business and the Assets (ii) with
respect to  Seller\'s 2003 and 2004 corporate income Tax Return, to
determine  whether to elect to file such corporate income Tax Return on the
basis  of the fiscal unity regime as applicable in 2002, and (iii) an 
opportunity to review any Seller Tax Return which includes a net loss  that
would be carried back to a Pre-Closing Tax Period and result in a  refund
described in Section 2.01(b)(ii)(E). If Purchaser reasonably  objects to the
treatment of any such item, Purchaser shall, as promptly  as practicable,
notify Seller in writing that it so objects, specifying  with particularity
any such item and stating the specific factual or  legal basis for any such
objection. If any such notice of objection is  delivered, Seller and
Purchaser shall negotiate in good faith to  resolve their disagreement. If
Seller and Purchaser have not resolved  their disagreement within five
Business Days after receipt by Seller of  such notice, they shall refer the
matter for resolution to independent  accountants, the decision of which
shall be binding on Seller and  Purchaser. The costs, fees and expenses of
the independent accountants  shall be borne by (1) Seller if the net
resolution of the disputed  items favors Purchaser, (2) Purchaser if the net
resolution of the  disputed items favor Seller, and (3) otherwise equally by
Purchaser and  Seller. If a Tax Return for any Straddle Period is required to
be filed  before the independent accountants are unable to make a
determination  with respect to any disputed item, then, notwithstanding the
filing of  such Tax Return, the independent accountants shall make a
determination  with respect to any disputed issue and appropriate adjustments
shall be  made to reflect such determination not later than five Business
Days  after such decision has been rendered.   Section 8.05. Refunds and
Credits. Any Tax refund or amount credited or offset against Tax that is
actually realized by Seller (including the application or carry-forward of a
deduction, loss or other Tax benefit from a Pre-Closing Tax Period to offset
or reduce any Taxes payable by Seller under Section 2.02(b)(i)) or with
respect to the Business or the Assets (other than any refund retained by
Seller under Section 2.01(b)(ii)) shall be for the account of Purchaser, and
Seller shall pay over to Purchaser the amount of any such refund, credit,
offset or reduction within ten days after receipt of such refund or
utilization of such credit, offset or reduction.   Section 8.06. Tax
Information and Cooperation. Seller and Purchaser shall reasonably cooperate,
and shall cause their respective Affiliates, officers, employees, agents,
auditors and other representatives reasonably to cooperate, in preparing and
filing all Tax Returns, including providing powers of attorney, maintaining
and making available to each other all records necessary in connection with
Taxes and in resolving all disputes and audits with respect to all taxable
periods relating to Taxes. Such cooperation shall include the retention and
(upon the other party\'s request) the provision of records and information
which are reasonably relevant to any such audit, litigation or other
proceeding and making employees available on a mutually convenient basis to
provide additional information and explanation of any material provided
hereunder. Any information obtained under this Section 8.06 shall be kept
confidential, except as may be otherwise necessary in connection with the
filing of Tax Returns or claims for refund or in conducting an audit or other
proceeding.   Section 8.07. Tax Ruling. Seller and Purchaser
shall reasonably cooperate to obtain a ruling from the Dutch tax authority
regarding the structure described in Section 2.09(a), or such alternative
rulings as Seller and Purchaser may jointly agree, to the effect that any
payment made under this Agreement by Purchaser or on behalf of Purchaser to
Seller or on behalf of Seller for any Assumed Liabilities will be treated as
an additional installment of the Purchase Price as referred to in article 13
para 1, Corporate Income Tax Act, and accordingly that any such payment will
not constitute a taxable profit item for Seller.   ARTICLE IX   CLOSING
CONDITIONS   Section 9.01. Conditions to Each Party\'s Obligations.
The respective obligations of each Party to consummate the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement are subject to the fulfillment at or prior to
the Closing Date of each of the following conditions, any or all of which may

have  instituted any action or proceeding (which remains pending at what 
would otherwise be the Closing Date) before any court in The  Netherlands,
the European Union, the United States or any other country  or before any
other Governmental Authority of competent jurisdiction  seeking to enjoin,
restrain or otherwise prohibit consummation of the  transactions contemplated
by this Agreement, except, in the case of (i)  and (ii), for Laws, actions
and proceedings that do not and would not  reasonably be expected to have,
individually or in the aggregate, a  Material Adverse Effect.   (d) All
authorizations, consents or approvals of a  Governmental Authority (other
than those specified in Section 9.01(b)  hereof) required in connection with
the execution and delivery of this  Agreement and the performance of the
obligations hereunder shall have  been made or obtained, without any
limitation, restriction or condition  that has or would reasonably be
expected to have, individually or in  the aggregate, a Material Adverse
Effect, except for such  authorizations, consents or approvals, the failures
of which to have  been made or obtained do not and would not reasonably be
expected to  have, individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse
Effect.   Section 9.02. Conditions to the Obligations of Parent
and Purchaser. The obligations of each of Parent and Purchaser to consummate
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement are subject to the
fulfillment at or prior to the Closing Date of each of the following
additional conditions, any or all of which may be waived in whole or part by
Parent to the extent permitted by applicable Law:   (a) The representations
and warranties of Seller contained  herein shall have been true when made and
on and as of the Closing Date  as though made on and as of the Closing Date
(except for  representations and warranties expressly made as of a specified
date,  which need be true only as of the specified date); provided,
however,  that this condition shall be deemed satisfied with respect to all 
representations and warranties (except for the representations and 
warranties set forth in Section 3.02) unless all failures of such 
representations and warranties to be so true and correct (without  giving
effect to any materiality, Material Adverse Effect or similar 
qualification), in the aggregate, have had, or would reasonably be  expected
to have, a Material Adverse Effect.   (b) Seller shall have performed or
complied in all material  respects with all covenants and agreements
contained herein required to  be performed or complied with by it prior to or
at the time of the  Closing.   (c) Seller shall have delivered to Parent a

withholding pursuant to Treasury regulation Section 1.1445-2.   (e) All
approvals of the FCC and AT required to consummate the  transactions shall
have been received without the imposition of any  condition that would
reasonably be expected to have, individually or in  the aggregate, a material
adverse effect on Purchaser, Parent or any of  their Affiliates or a Material
Adverse Effect; there shall be no  outstanding petition for reconsideration,
application for review or  judicial appeal of such consent which is
reasonably likely to result in  a reversal of such consent or the imposition
of a condition that would  reasonably be expected to have, individually or in
the aggregate, a  material adverse effect on Purchaser, Parent or any of
their Affiliates  or a Material Adverse Effect; and the time for filing any
such  petition, application or appeal shall have expired, provided that the 
expiration of the time for such filing will not be a condition to  Parent\'s
or Purchaser\'s obligations to effect the closing if no  petition to deny or
objection was filed at the FCC against the FCC  applications prior to the
granting of such applications by the FCC or  relevant FCC staff official
pursuant to delegated authority. Parent and  Purchaser may waive the
requirement that the FCC approval not be  subject to further review,
reconsideration or judicial appeal which is  reasonably likely to result in a
reversal of such consent or the  imposition of a condition that would
reasonably be expected to have,  individually or in the aggregate, a material
adverse effect on  Purchaser, Parent or any of their Affiliates or a Material
Adverse  Effect as a condition to its obligation to close.   (f) The FCC
shall have (i) issued an order or notice updating,  or taken such other
action necessary to update, the "Permitted Space  Station List" to reflect
Purchaser as the new owner and operator of the  Seller Satellites with terms
and conditions that do not, and would not  be reasonably expected to, have,
individually or in the aggregate, a  material adverse effect on Parent, its
Affiliates or Purchaser or a  Material Adverse Effect; provided that
Purchaser and Parent shall  accept conditions, if required by the FCC, (A) to
insulate non-U.S.  entities with direct or indirect interests in Purchaser or
Parent and  (B) to cap or limit further investments in Purchaser or Parent
by  non-U.S. entities (other than in the case of either clause (A) or (B), 
for non-U.S. entities (1) that are Cayman Islands limited partnerships  or

Capital Partners (Cayman) IV L.P. and Blackstone FI  Communication Partners
(Cayman) L.P and in existence as of the date  hereof or (2) that are formed
specifically for the purpose of this  transaction in jurisdictions which
Purchaser reasonably believes would  not adversely affect the receipt of FCC
approvals and that individually  or collectively with each other or those
entities identified in clause  (1) above, hold, directly or indirectly, a
100% interest in Purchaser  or Parent); and (ii) made an affirmative
determination specified in 47  U.S.C.ss. 761(a) in writing, or otherwise
determined in writing that 47  U.S.C.ss.761(a) does not apply to this
transaction.   (g) Purchaser shall have received written permission of the 
Dutch Ministry of Economic Affairs or the AT, which permission, in as  far as
the rights and obligations pertaining to orbital slots and  frequencies as
mentioned in the Dutch Seller Permits issued by The  Netherlands (as set
forth in Schedule 3.12(a)) are concerned, is  substantially the same as the
permission set forth in such Dutch  Permits, except for such differences as
would not reasonably be  expected to have, individually or in the aggregate,
a material adverse  effect on Purchaser, Parent or any of their Affiliates or
a Material  Adverse Effect.   (h) Purchaser shall have received the funds
committed for the  Debt Financing on the terms and conditions set forth in
the Debt  Financing Commitment Letter or upon terms and conditions which are,
in  the reasonable judgment of Purchaser, comparable or more favorable to

forth in the Debt Commitment Letter, then upon terms and conditions  which
are reasonable and customary.   (i) Subject to and taking into account
arrangements entered  pursuant to Section 6.14, Seller shall have received
all requisite  consents, authorizations and approvals from third parties
(other than  Governmental Authorities) other than those the absence of which
would  not reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate,
a  Material Adverse Effect.   Section 9.03. Conditions to the Obligations
of Seller. The obligations of Seller to consummate the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement are subject to the fulfillment at or prior to
the Closing Date of each of the following conditions, any or all of which may
be waived in whole or in part by Seller to the extent permitted by applicable
Law:   (a) The representations and warranties of each of Parent and 
Purchaser contained herein shall have been true when made and on and as  of
the Closing Date as though made on and as of the Closing Date  (except for
representations and warranties made as of a specified date,  which need be
true only as of the specified date); provided, however,  that this condition
shall be deemed satisfied unless all failures of  such representations and
warranties to be so true and correct (without  giving effect to any
materiality or similar qualification), in the  aggregate, have had, or would
reasonably be expected to have a material  adverse effect on the ability of
any of Parent or Purchaser to perform  their respective obligations under
this Agreement.   (b) Each of Parent and Purchaser shall have performed or 
complied in all material respects with all covenants and agreements 
contained herein required to be performed or complied with by it prior  to or
at the time of the Closing.   (c) Parent shall have delivered to Seller a
certificate, dated  the date of the Closing, signed by an executive officer
of Parent,  certifying as to the fulfillment of the conditions specified in

be abandoned at any time prior to the Closing Date by mutual written consent
of Seller and Parent duly authorized by the Seller Boards and Parent.  
Section 10.02. Termination by Either Parent or Seller. This Agreement may be
terminated and the transactions contemplated by this Agreement may be
abandoned at any time prior to the Closing Date by Seller or Parent if:  
(a) the Closing Date shall not have occurred by April 5, 2005;  provided
that, if all conditions to the obligations of the parties set  forth in
Article IX other than the conditions set forth in Sections  9.01(b), 9.01(d),
9.02(e), 9.02(f) and 9.02(g) and conditions to be  satisfied at the Closing
have been satisfied or waived prior to such  date, then the right to
terminate this Agreement pursuant to this  Section 10.02(a) shall not be
available to any party until September 5,  2005;   (b) the Required Seller
Vote shall not have been obtained at  the Seller Shareholders Meeting or at
any adjournment or postponement  thereof; or   (c) any Governmental
Authority shall have issued or adopted a  final Law or Order or taken any
other final action restraining,  enjoining or otherwise prohibiting the
transactions contemplated hereby  and such Law or other action is or shall
have become final and  nonappealable, except for Laws, Orders or actions that
do not and would  not reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the
aggregate, a  material adverse effect on Purchaser, Parent or any of their
Affiliates  or a Material Adverse Effect;  provided that, the right to
terminate this Agreement pursuant to this Section 10.02 shall not be
available to any party that has breached in any material respect its
obligations under this Agreement in any manner that shall have proximately
contributed to the occurrence of the failure of the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement to be consummated.   Section 10.03. Termination by Seller.
This Agreement may be terminated and the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement may be abandoned at any time prior to the Closing Date by Seller
if:   (a) there is a breach by Parent or Purchaser of any  representation,
warranty, covenant or agreement contained in this  Agreement that would give
rise to a failure of a condition set forth in  Sections 9.03(a) or 9.03(b),
which has not been cured (or is not  capable of being cured) within fifteen
Business Days following receipt  by Parent of written notice of such
breach;   (b) prior to the obtaining of the Required Seller Vote, Seller 
shall have received an Acquisition Proposal which the Seller Boards  have
determined to constitute a Superior Proposal pursuant to and in  accordance
with Section 6.04 and to accept; provided that (i) Seller  shall have

contained herein. Any agreement on the part of either Party hereto to any
such extension or waiver shall be valid only if set forth in an instrument in

rights.   ARTICLE XI   MISCELLANEOUS   Section 11.01. Nonsurvival of

any or  all of its rights, interests and obligations under this Agreement
