(a) At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any further
action on the part of Parent, the Company, Merger Sub or the holders of any
of the following securities:

(i) _Conversion of Shares_. Each share of common stock of the Company,
par value $0.01 per share (each, a " _Share_ "), that is issued and
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time, other than Cancelled
Shares and Dissenting Shares, shall be automatically converted into the right
to receive $3.00 in cash (the " _Merger Consideration_ "), net of applicable
tax withholding, without interest, payable to the holder thereof upon
surrender of such Shares in the manner provided in this  _Article II_. All of
the Shares converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration
pursuant to this _Article II_ shall, by virtue of the Merger and without any
action on the part of the holder thereof, cease to be outstanding,
be cancelled and cease to exist, cease to have any rights with respect
thereto and each holder of Shares outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time that are represented by a valid certificate (a " _Certificate_
") or Shares represented by book-entry immediately prior to the Effective
Time (" _Book-Entry Shares_ "), shall thereafter cease to have any rights with
respect to such Shares except the right to receive the Merger Consideration
into which the Shares have been converted; _provided_ , that any Section 102
Shares Consideration shall be paid to the 102 Trustee for distribution to the
holders of the Section 102 Shares.

 

(ii) _Cancellation of Parent, Merger Sub and Company Owned Shares_. Each
Share that is issued immediately prior to the Effective Time and that is held
in treasury by the Company and each Share that is issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time and that is owned, directly or
indirectly, by the Company, Parent, Merger Sub or any of their respective
Subsidiaries (collectively, the " _Cancelled Shares_ ") shall, by virtue of
the Merger and without any action on the part of the holder thereof, be
cancelled and shall cease to exist, cease to have any rights with respect
thereto and no consideration shall be delivered in exchange for such
cancellation.

 

(iii) _Conversion of Common Stock of Merger Sub_. Each share of common
stock, par value $0.01 per share, of Merger Sub issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be, without any action on the
part of the holder of any capital stock of the Company, Parent or Merger Sub,
automatically converted into and become one validly issued, fully paid and
nonassessable share of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of the
Surviving Corporation. From and after the Effective Time, all certificates
representing the shares of common stock of Merger Sub shall evidence the
number of shares of common stock of the Surviving Corporation into which such
shares have been so converted, until the same are surrendered for cancellation
and exchange.

 

(b) _Shares of Dissenting Stockholders_.

 

(i) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary (but subject
to  _Section_ __ _ 2.1(b)(ii)_), Shares issued and outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective Time that are held

 



-3- 

    

 by a holder who is entitled to demand and has properly demanded appraisal
for such Shares in accordance with, and who complies in all respects with,
Section 262 of the DGCL (such Shares, the " _Dissenting Shares_ ") shall not
be converted into or represent the right to receive the Merger Consideration
as described in _Section_ __ _ 2.1(a)(i)_, but instead, at the Effective
Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any further action on the part of
Parent, the Company, Merger Sub or the holders of any of the Dissenting
Shares, shall cease to be outstanding, be cancelled and cease to exist and
shall be converted into the right to receive only payment of the fair value
of such Dissenting Shares in accordance with and to the extent provided by
Section 262 of the DGCL.

 

(ii) Notwithstanding the provisions of _Section_ __ _ 2.1(b)(i)_, if any
holder of Dissenting Shares timely withdraws its demand for appraisal or
fails to perfect or otherwise waives or loses its right of appraisal pursuant
to the DGCL, then the right of such holder to be paid the fair value of such
Dissenting Shares under the DGCL shall cease, and such Dissenting Shares
shall be deemed to have automatically been converted into, as of the Effective
Time, and represent only, the right to receive the Merger Consideration, net
of applicable tax withholding, without interest, as set forth in _Section_ __
_ 2.1(a)(i)_.

(iii) At the Effective Time, subject to the provisions of _Section_ __ _
2.1(b)(ii)_, any holder of Dissenting Shares shall cease to have any rights
with respect to such Dissenting Shares, except the right to receive only
payment of the fair value of such Dissenting Shares in accordance with and to
the extent provided by Section 262 of the DGCL. The Company shall give Parent
prompt written notice of any demands or actual or, to the extent that the
Company has Knowledge, attempted withdrawals of such demands for appraisal of
Shares received by the Company, and any other instruments served on the
Company pursuant to Section 262 of the DGCL and shall give Parent the
opportunity to participate in and direct all negotiations and
proceedings with respect thereto. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company
shall not, except with the prior written consent of Parent, make any payment
with respect to, or settle or compromise or offer to settle or compromise, any
such demands or waive any failure to timely deliver a written demand for
appraisal or otherwise comply with the provisions under Section 262 of the
DGCL, or agree or commit to do any of the foregoing. Parent shall have the
right to direct the Paying Agent to return to Parent upon Parents demand any
portion of the aggregate Merger Consideration made available to the Paying
Agent to pay for Shares that have become Dissenting Shares.

 

Section 2.2 _Treatment of Company Equity Awards_.

 

(a) _Treatment of Restricted Stock Units_. At the Effective Time, by
virtue of the Merger and without any further action on the part of Parent,
the Company, Merger Sub or the holders of any Company RSU, each restricted
stock unit award in respect of Shares granted under each Company Equity Award
Plan that is outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (a "
_Company RSU_ ") shall fully vest (including Company RSUs subject to
performance-based vesting) and shall be cancelled and converted automatically
into the right to receive, as soon as reasonably practicable after the
Effective Time (but no later than the first regularly scheduled payroll date
that is at least five (5) Business Days after the Effective Time), from or on
behalf of the Surviving Corporation, an amount in cash, without interest,
equal to the product of (i) the amount of the Merger Consideration and (ii)
the total number of Shares underlying such Company RSU, net of applicable tax
withholding. Following the Effective Time, each Company RSU shall cease to be
outstanding, be cancelled and cease to exist and the holder of any such
Company RSU shall not be entitled to any payment other than those pursuant to
this _Section 2.2(a)_ in respect thereof.

 

(b) _Treatment of Options_. At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger
and without any further action on the part of Parent, the Company, Merger Sub
or the holders of any Company Option, each option award in respect of Shares
granted under each Company Equity Award Plan that is unexercised and
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (a " _Company Option_ "),
if any, whether vested or unvested, and that has an exercise price per Share
that is less than the amount of the Merger Consideration, shall fully vest and
shall be 

 



-4- 

    

 cancelled and converted automatically into the right to receive, as soon as
reasonably practicable after the Effective Time (but no later than the first
regularly scheduled payroll date that is at least five (5) Business Days
after the Effective Time), from or on behalf of the Surviving Corporation, an
amount in cash, without interest, equal to the product of (i) the amount by
which the amount of the Merger Consideration exceeds the exercise price per
Share of such Company Option and (ii) the total number of Shares subject to
such Company Option, net of applicable tax withholding. At the Effective Time,
each Company Option, if any, that has an exercise price per Share that is
greater than or equal to the Merger Consideration shall cease to be
outstanding, be cancelled and cease to exist and the holder of any such
Company Option shall not be entitled to payment of any consideration therefor.
Following the Effective Time, each Company Option shall cease to be
outstanding, be cancelled and cease to exist and the holder of any such
Company Option shall not be entitled to any payment other than those pursuant
to this  _Section_ __ _ 2.2(b)_ in respect thereof.

(c) _Treatment of Restricted Stock_. At the Effective Time, by virtue of
the Merger and without any further action on the part of the Company, Parent,
Merger Sub or the holders of any Company Restricted Stock, all restrictions
and vesting requirements with respect to each share of restricted stock
granted under each Company Equity Award Plan that is outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective Time (a " _Company Restricted Stock_ ") shall at the
Effective Time, lapse and all such shares of Company Restricted Stock
shall be vested in full. Holders of shares of Company Restricted Stock shall
be treated as a holder of Shares for all purposes of this Agreement and
receive Merger Consideration for such shares in accordance with _Section
2.1(a)(i)_ of this Agreement.

(d) _Corporate Actions_. As soon as reasonably practicable following the
date of this Agreement, and in any event prior to the Effective Time, the
Company, the Company Board and the compensation committee of the Company
Board, as applicable, shall adopt any resolutions and take any and all actions
that are necessary to effectuate the provisions of _Section_ __ _ 2.2(a)_,
_Section_ __ _ 2.2(b)_ and _Section_ __ _ 2.2(c)_ (including the
satisfaction of the requirements of Rule 16b-3(e) promulgated under the
Exchange Act and the treatment of the Company RSUs, Company Options and
Company Restricted Stock specified therein). As of the Effective Time, the
Company Equity Award Plans and any related awards issued thereunder shall be
terminated. Prior to the Closing, the Company shall take all actions
necessary to ensure that, from and after the Effective Time, neither Parent
nor the Surviving Corporation will be required to deliver Shares or other
capital stock or other Equity Interests (including phantom stock) of the
Company or any other Person to any Person pursuant to or in settlement of
Company RSUs, Company Options, if any, Company Restricted Stock or any other
awards under any Company Equity Award Plan. If and as required by Parent or
Merger Sub, the Company will take all action necessary to terminate all
Company Equity Award Plans effective as of the Effective Time.

 

Section 2.3 _Certain Adjustments_. If, between the date hereof and the
Effective Time, the outstanding Shares shall have been changed into a
different number of shares or a different class of shares, in each case, by
reason of any stock dividend, subdivision, reorganization, reclassification,
recapitalization, stock split, reverse stock split, combination or exchange
of shares, or any similar event shall have occurred, then the Merger
Consideration shall be equitably adjusted, without duplication and without any
increase in aggregate amounts payable by Parent hereunder, to the extent
appropriate to provide the same economic effect as contemplated by this
Agreement prior to such change.

 Section 2.4 _Exchange of Certificates_.

(a) _Appointment of Paying Agent_. Prior to the Closing, Parent shall
appoint a bank or trust company reasonably acceptable to the Company to act as
paying agent (the " _Paying Agent_ ") for the payment of the Merger
Consideration pursuant to  _Section_ __ _ 2.1(a)(i)_ and Parent or Merger
Sub shall enter into a paying agent agreement reasonably acceptable to the
Company relating to the Paying Agents responsibilities under this Agreement.

 

(b) _Deposit of Merger Consideration_. At or substantially concurrent with
the Effective Time, Parent shall deposit, or cause to be deposited, with the
Paying Agent, for the benefit of the holders of Shares, cash that

 



-5- 

    

 when taken together with a portion of the cash available on the Companys
balance sheet (after taking into account the Companys and its Subsidiaries
outstanding expenses as determined by the Company and subject to approval by
the Companys and its Subsidiaries lenders under the Credit Facilities, if
required) that is deposited with the Paying Agent at the Effective Time is
sufficient to pay the aggregate Merger Consideration payable pursuant to
_Section_ __ _ 2.1(a)(i)_ (such aggregate Merger Consideration and any
proceeds thereon, the " _Payment Fund_ ").

 

(c) _Section 102_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in
this Agreement, the Paying Agent shall deliver any consideration payable or
otherwise deliverable pursuant to this Agreement to holders of Section 102
Shares directly to the 102 Trustee to be held and released in accordance with
the provisions of Section 102 of the Ordinance and the 102 Tax Ruling;
_provided_ , _however_ , that in the event that the 102 Tax Ruling or the
Interim Tax Ruling is not obtained prior to Closing, then the 102 Trustee will
withhold tax at source from the consideration payable to holders of Section
102 Shares in accordance with the Income Tax Regulations (withholding from
salary and wages), 5753-1993.

 

(d) _Exchange Procedures_. As promptly as practicable (and no later than
the third (3rd) Business Day) after the Effective Time, Parent or the
Surviving Corporation shall cause the Paying Agent to mail to each holder of
record of Shares whose Shares were converted pursuant to _Section_ __ _
2.1(a)(i)_ into the right to receive the Merger Consideration (i) a letter of
transmittal, in form and substance reasonably acceptable to Parent and the
Company, which shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss
and title to the Certificates shall pass, only upon delivery of the
Certificates to the Paying Agent, or in the case of Book-Entry Shares, upon
adherence to the procedures set forth in the letter of transmittal (the "
_Letter of Transmittal_ ") and (ii) instructions for use in effecting
the surrender of Certificates or Book-Entry Shares in exchange for the Merger
Consideration.

(e) _Surrender of Certificates or Book-Entry Shares_. Upon surrender of
Certificates or Book-Entry Shares to the Paying Agent for cancellation,
together with the Letter of Transmittal, duly completed and validly executed
in accordance with the instructions thereto, and such other documents as may
reasonably be required by the Paying Agent, the holder of such Certificates or
Book-Entry Shares shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor the Merger
Consideration into which each Share formerly represented by such Certificates
or Book-Entry Shares has been converted pursuant to this Agreement. Any
Certificates so surrendered shall forthwith be cancelled. In the event of a
transfer of ownership of Shares that is not registered in the transfer or
stock records of the Company or if for any other reason payment of the Merger
Consideration is to be made to a Person other than the Person in whose name
any surrendered Certificate or Book-Entry Share is registered, any cash to be
paid upon due surrender of the Certificate or Book-Entry Share formerly
representing such Shares shall be paid to any such transferee only if such
Certificate or Book-Entry Share is presented to the Paying Agent, accompanied
by all documents required to evidence and effect such transfer and to
evidence that any applicable stock transfer or other similar Taxes required by
reason of the payment of the Merger Consideration to a Person other than the
registered holder of the Certificate or Book-Entry Share so surrendered have
been paid or are not applicable (and any such applicable Taxes actually have
been paid). No interest shall be paid or shall accrue on the Merger
Consideration payable upon surrender of any Certificate or Book-Entry
Share. Until surrendered as contemplated hereby, each Certificate or Book-
Entry Share shall be deemed at any time after the Effective Time to represent
only the right to receive the Merger Consideration as contemplated by this
Agreement.

 

(f) _Lost Certificates_. If any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen
or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit (in form and substance
reasonably acceptable to Parent) of that fact by the Person claiming such
Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed, reasonably acceptable to the
Paying Agent, together with the Letter of Transmittal, duly completed and
validly executed in accordance with the instructions thereto, and such other
documents as may be reasonably required by the Paying Agent or the Surviving
Corporation, and, if required by the Surviving Corporation or the Paying
Agent, the posting by such Person of a bond in a customary amount as
indemnity against any claim that may be made against it or the Surviving
Corporation with respect to such Certificate, the Paying Agent (or, if
subsequent to the termination of the Payment Fund and subject to _Section_ __
_ 2.4(j)_, Parent or the Surviving Corporation) shall deliver, in exchange
for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate, the Merger Consideration in
accordance with the terms of this Agreement.

 



-6- 

    

(g) _No Further Ownership Rights in Shares_. At the Effective Time, all
Shares outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall automatically
be cancelled and shall cease to exist in exchange for the consideration issued
pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 2.1_, and all holders of Shares that were
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall cease to have any
rights as stockholders of the Company except as provided for in _Section_ __ _
2.1_. The Merger Consideration paid in accordance with the terms of this
_Article II_ shall be deemed payment in full satisfaction of all rights
pertaining to the Shares previously represented by such Certificates or Book-
Entry Shares, subject, however, to the Surviving Corporations obligation to
pay any dividends or make any other distributions with a record date prior to
the Effective Time which remain unpaid at the Effective Time.

 

(h) _Closing of Transfer Books_. At the Effective Time, the stock transfer
books of the Company shall be closed, and there shall be no further
registration of transfers on the transfer books of the Surviving Corporation
of the Shares which were outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time.
If, from and after the Effective Time, Certificates or Book-Entry Shares are
presented to the Surviving Corporation, Parent or the Paying Agent for
transfer or any other reason, they shall be cancelled and exchanged as
provided in this _Article II_.

 

(i) _Investment of Payment Fund_. Until disbursed in accordance with the
terms and conditions of this Agreement, the Payment Fund shall be invested by
the Paying Agent as directed by Merger Sub or, from and after the Closing, the
Surviving Corporation in (i) obligations of or fully guaranteed by the United
States or any agency or instrumentality thereof and backed by the full faith
and credit of the United States with a maturity of no more than thirty (30)
days; (ii) commercial paper obligations rated A-I or P-I or better by Moodys
Investors Service, Inc. or Standard and Poors Corporation, respectively, (iii)
certificates of deposit, bank repurchase agreements or bankers acceptances of
commercial banks with capital exceeding $1,000,000,000 (based on the most
recent financial statements of such bank that are then publicly available),
(iv) in mutual funds investing in one or more of any such assets or (v) such
other manner as is set forth in the paying agent agreement contemplated by
_Section_ __ _ 2.4(a)_ and approved by the Company prior to the Effective
Time. To the extent that (A) there are any losses with respect to any
investments of the Payment Fund or (B) the Payment Fund diminishes for any
reason below the level required for the Paying Agent to promptly pay the cash
amounts contemplated by _Section_ __ _ 2.1_, Parent will, or will cause the
Surviving Corporation or another Person to, promptly replace or restore the
amount of cash in the Payment Fund so as to ensure that the Payment Fund is at
all times fully available for distribution and maintained at a level
sufficient for the Paying Agent to make the payments contemplated by 
_Section_ __ _ 2.1_. Any interest or income produced by such investments will
be payable to the Surviving Corporation or Parent, as Parent directs.

 

(j) _Termination of Payment Fund_. Any portion of the Payment Fund
(including any interest or other amounts received with respect thereto) that
remains unclaimed by, or otherwise undistributed to, the holders of
Certificates and Book-Entry Shares on the one (1) year anniversary of the
Effective Time shall be delivered to Parent, upon demand, and any holder of
Certificates or Book-Entry Shares that has not theretofore complied with this
Article II shall thereafter look only to Parent or the Surviving Corporation
(subject to abandoned property, escheat or other similar Laws), as general
creditors thereof, for satisfaction of its claim for Merger Consideration.
Any amounts remaining unclaimed by such holders at such time at which such
amounts would otherwise escheat to or become property of any Governmental
Entity shall become, to the extent permitted by applicable Law, the property
of Parent or its designee, free and clear of all claims or interest of any
person previously entitled thereto.

 

(k) _No Liability_. Subject to applicable Law, none of Parent, the
Company, Merger Sub or the Paying Agent shall be liable to any Person in
respect of any portion of the Merger Consideration delivered to a public
official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar
Law.

 

(l) _Withholding_. Each of the Paying Agent, Parent, Merger Sub, the 102
Trustee, the Company and the Surviving Corporation, as applicable, shall be
entitled to deduct and withhold from any amounts payable or otherwise
deliverable pursuant to this Agreement such amounts as may be required to be
deducted or withheld under the Code or any provision of state, local or
non-U.S. Tax Law or under any other applicable Law or the 102 Tax Ruling;
provided that, Paying Agent, Parent, and Merger Sub, as applicable, shall use
commercially 

 



-7- 

    

 reasonable efforts to (i) promptly notify (in reasonable detail) the Company
in advance of any such withholding and (ii) cooperate with the Company to
reduce such withholding, in each case, other than such withholding in respect
of compensatory payments or as a result of any failure to deliver any
certificates claiming an exemption from such withholding and required to be so
delivered pursuant to the terms of this Agreement or any Letter of
Transmittal. To the extent such amounts are so deducted or withheld and paid
over to the appropriate Governmental Entity, such amounts shall be treated for
all purposes under this Agreement as having been paid to or for the benefit
of the Person to whom such amounts would otherwise have been paid.

 

Section 2.5 _Further Action_. If, at any time after the Effective Time,
any further action is determined by Parent or the Surviving Corporation to be
necessary or desirable to carry out the purposes of this Agreement or to vest
the Surviving Corporation with full right, title and possession of and to all
rights and property of Merger Sub and the Company, the officers and directors
of the Surviving Corporation and Parent shall be fully authorized (in the name
of Merger Sub, in the name of the Company and otherwise) to take such action.

Material Adverse Effect. With respect to the Israeli Subs, each of the Israeli
Subs is a corporation duly organized and validly existing and is not a

all material respects with the applicable requirements of the Securities Act
and the Exchange Act, as the case may be, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and the
applicable rules and regulations promulgated thereunder. As of their
respective dates (and, if amended, as of the date of such amendment), the
Company SEC Documents did not, and any Subsequent Company SEC Documents will
not, contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a
material fact required to be stated or incorporated by reference therein or
necessary to make the statements made therein, in light of the circumstances
under which they were made, not misleading. None of the Subsidiaries of the
Company is currently or has, since becoming a Subsidiary of the Company been,
required to file any forms, reports or other documents with the SEC.

(b) As of the date hereof, none of the Company SEC Documents is

schedules) of the Company included or incorporated by reference in the
Company SEC Documents (collectively, the " _Financial Statements_ "), and the
consolidated financial statements (including all related notes and schedules
thereto) included in the Subsequent Company SEC Documents will, (i) fairly
present in all material respects the consolidated financial position of the
Company and its consolidated Subsidiaries, as of the respective dates thereof,
and the consolidated results of their operations and their consolidated cash
flows for the respective periods then ended (subject, in the case of unaudited
interim statements, to normal year-end audit adjustments that are not or will
not be material in amount or effect), (ii) as of their respective filing
dates with the SEC (if amended, as of the date of the last such amendment,

basis during the periods involved (except as may be indicated therein or in
the notes thereto as permitted by Regulation S-X promulgated by the SEC).

(d) Except as have been described in the Company SEC Documents, there are
no unconsolidated Subsidiaries of the Company and neither the Company nor any

disclosed in the Companys financial statements in accordance with GAAP,

aside to cover severance payments to the Israeli Employees constitute,
together with any funds deposited since the date of the Financial Statements
until the date of this Agreement in any pension fund, provident fund,
"managers" insurance and similar funds, in the aggregate, a sufficient

Section 3.5 _Internal Controls and Procedures_. The Company has
established and maintains a system of internal control over financial
reporting as required by Rule 13a-15 or Rule 15d-15 under the Exchange Act.
Such internal control over financial reporting is effective in providing
reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the
preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with
generally accepted accounting principles and includes policies and procedures
that (a) pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail
accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets
of the Company, (b) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are
recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in
accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts
and expenditures of the Company are being made only in accordance with
authorizations of management and directors of the Company and (c) provide
reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized
acquisition, use or disposition of the Companys assets that could have a
material effect on its financial statements. The Company maintains disclosure
controls and procedures as required by Rule 13a-15 or Rule 15d-15 under the
Exchange Act. Such disclosure controls and procedures are reasonably
effective to ensure that all material information relating to the Company and
its Subsidiaries required to be disclosed in the Companys periodic reports
under the Exchange Act and within the time periods specified in the SECs
rules is made known to the Companys principal executive officer and its
principal financial officer by others within the

 



-12- 

    

 Company or any of its Subsidiaries, and such disclosure controls and
procedures are effective in timely alerting the Companys principal executive
officer and its principal financial officer to such information required to
be included in the Companys periodic reports required under the Exchange Act.
With respect to the consolidated financial statements filed by the Company
with the SEC since January 1, 2017, neither the Audit Committee of the
Company Board or, to the Knowledge of the Company, the Companys auditors has
identified: (x) any significant deficiencies or material weaknesses in the
design or operation of internal control over financial reporting that are
reasonably likely to adversely affect in any material respect the Companys or
any of its Subsidiaries ability to record, process, summarize and report
financial information or (y) any fraud or allegation of fraud, whether or
not material, that involves (or involved) management or other employees who
have (or had) a significant role in the Companys internal control over
financial reporting. The Company is, and has been since January 1, 2017, in
compliance in all material respects with the applicable provisions of the
Sarbanes-Oxley Act and the applicable listing and corporate governance rules
and regulations of Nasdaq. The Companys management has completed
an assessment of the effectiveness of the Companys internal control over
financial reporting in compliance with the requirements of Section 404 of the
Sarbanes-Oxley Act for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2018, and such
assessment concluded that such system was effective. Neither the Company nor
any of its Subsidiaries has outstanding, or has arranged any outstanding,
"extension of credit" to directors or executive officers of the Company
prohibited by Section 402 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. No executive officer of
the Company has failed, in the last two (2) years, to make the certifications
required of him or her under Section 302 or 906 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act
with respect to any Company SEC Documents, except as disclosed in
certifications filed with such Company SEC Documents. Neither the Company nor,

Company Permit and has fulfilled and performed all of its obligations in all
respects with respect thereto, no event has occurred which, with or without
notice or the lapse of time or both, would constitute a default or violation
of any Company Permit. To the Knowledge of the Company, there has not been
any event, condition or circumstance that would preclude any Company Permit
from being renewed in the ordinary course (to the extent that such Company
Permit is renewable by its terms), except where the failure thereof to be
renewed has not had and would not reasonably be expected to have a Material
Adverse Effect.

interfere unreasonably with the normal operations of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries and (ii) coordinated exclusively through the designated
Representatives of the Company.

(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this _Section_
__ _ 5.4_, neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries shall be required
to provide any access, or make available any document, correspondence or
information, if doing so would, in the reasonable judgment of the Companys
legal counsel, (i) jeopardize the attorney-client privilege of the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries or Affiliates or (ii) violate any (A) Law applicable
to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or the assets, or operation of the
business, of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or (B) Contract to which
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is a party or by which any of their
assets or properties are bound; _provided_ , that in such instances the
Company shall inform Parent of the general nature of the information being
withheld, upon Parents request, reasonably cooperate with the Company to
provide such information, in whole or in part, in a manner that would not
result in any of the outcomes described in the foregoing _clauses (i)_ and _
(ii)_.

(c) The parties hereto hereby agree that all information provided to them
or their respective Representatives in connection with this Agreement and the
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby shall be governed in
accordance with the Confidentiality Agreement, dated as of May 21, 2019,
between the Company and an Affiliate of Parent (the " _Confidentiality

(a) (i) During the period beginning on the date hereof and continuing until
12:01 a.m. New York City time on October 22, 2019 (the " _Solicitation Period

-35- 

    

 bank or potential provider of debt or equity financing, in negotiations and
discussions permitted by this _Section_ __ _ 5.5_.

 

(ii) At the Solicitation Period End Time (or, with respect to any Excluded
Party, at 12:01 a.m. New York City time on the fifteenth (15th) day after the
date on which the Solicitation Period End Time occurs (the " _Cut-Off
Time_")): (A) the Company shall, and shall cause each of its Subsidiaries
and each of their directors, officers, Representatives and Affiliates to,
immediately cease and cause to be terminated any existing solicitation of, or

hours) send written notice of such termination to any and all Persons with
whom it is terminating solicitations, discussions or negotiations under the
foregoing _clause (A)_ ; and (C) the Company shall as promptly as possible
(and in any event within twenty-four (24) hours) terminate dataroom access

its or their respective Representatives) in connection with an Acquisition
Proposal or any inquiry, discussion, offer or request that could reasonably be
expected to lead to an Acquisition Proposal.

 

(iii) No later than twenty-four (24) hours after the Solicitation Period
End Time, the Company shall provide Parent with a written summary of all
material terms of any then pending Acquisition Proposals that were made in
writing by any Excluded Party.

 

(b) From the Solicitation Period End Time (or, in the case of an Excluded
Party, the Cut-Off Time) until the earlier of the Effective Time and the
valid termination of this Agreement, except as expressly permitted by this
_Section_ __ _ 5.5_, the Company shall not (and shall not publicly announce
any intention to), directly or indirectly, and the Company shall cause each of
its Subsidiaries and their respective Representatives not to, (i) initiate,
solicit, knowingly facilitate or knowingly encourage any inquiry, discussion
negotiation, or request with respect to, or the making of, any proposal or
offer that could reasonably be expected to lead to, or that constitutes, any
Acquisition Proposal ( _provided_ , that the foregoing shall not prohibit
the Company or any of its Representatives from contacting any Person who has
made an Acquisition Proposal (or such Persons Representatives) solely for the
purpose of clarifying such Acquisition Proposal and any material terms
thereof), (ii) engage or enter into, continue or otherwise participate in any
negotiations or discussions concerning, or otherwise cooperate with, knowingly
assist or participate in, knowingly facilitate or provide access to any non-
public information or data or to its properties, books, records or personnel
to any Person relating to an Acquisition Proposal, (iii) approve, endorse,
enter into or recommend, or propose publicly to approve, endorse, enter into
or recommend, any Acquisition Proposal, or (iv) resolve or agree to take any

the Effective Time and the valid termination of this Agreement, except as
expressly permitted by this _Section_ __ _ 5.5_, the Company shall not (and
shall not publicly announce any intention to), directly or indirectly, and the
Company shall cause each of its Subsidiaries and their respective
Representatives not to, (A) execute or enter into any letter of intent,
agreement in principle, merger agreement, acquisition agreement or other

(an " _Alternative Acquisition Agreement_ ") or any Contract requiring the
Company to abandon, terminate or fail to consummate the Merger or the other
transactions contemplated hereby, or (B) resolve or agree to take any of
the foregoing actions. Any violation or breach of the restrictions or
obligations set forth in this _Section_ __ _ 5.5_ by any Subsidiary of the
Company or any Representative of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries acting
on behalf of or at the direction of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
shall be deemed to be a breach of this _Section_ __ _ 5.5_ by the Company.

 

(c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in _Section_ __ _ 5.5(b)_ of
this Agreement, nothing contained in this Agreement shall prevent the Company
or the Company Board (at the recommendation of the Special Committee) from
taking and disclosing to the stockholders of the Company a position
contemplated by Rule 14e-2(a) promulgated under the Exchange Act, complying
with Rule 14d-9 promulgated under the Exchange

 



-36- 

    

 Act, including a "stop, look and listen" communication by the Company Board
to the stockholders of the Company pursuant to Rule 14d-9(f) promulgated
under the Exchange Act (or any substantially similar communication), complying
with Item 1012(a) of Regulation M-A promulgated under the Exchange Act or from
making any legally required disclosure to the Companys stockholders with
regard to an Acquisition Proposal ( _provided_ , that neither the Company nor
the Company Board may recommend any Acquisition Proposal unless permitted by
_Section_ __ _ 5.5(f)_ and the Company may not fail to make, or withdraw,
modify or change in a manner materially adverse to Parent all or any portion
of, the Company Board Recommendation unless permitted by _Section_ __ _
5.5(f)_ or  _Section_ __ _ 5.5(g)_).

(d) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, after the
Solicitation Period End Time (or, in the case of an Excluded Party, the Cut-
Off Time), but prior to obtaining the Company Stockholder Approval, if the
Company or the Company Board receives a bona fide written Acquisition
Proposal that did not result from a material breach of this _Section_ __ _
5.5_ and the Special Committee shall have determined in good faith, after
consultation with its financial advisors and outside legal counsel, that (i)
such Acquisition Proposal constitutes a Superior Proposal or would reasonably
be expected to lead to a Superior Proposal and (ii) the failure to take the
actions set forth in _clauses (x)_ and _(y)_ below with respect to such
Acquisition Proposal would reasonably be expected to be inconsistent with the
Special Committees fiduciary duties to the Companys stockholders under
applicable Law, nothing contained in this Agreement shall prevent the Company
or the Company Board from: (x) providing access to its properties, books and
records and providing information or data in response to a request therefor by
a Person or group who has made such Acquisition Proposal; _provided_  that
(1) the Company Board has received from the Person or group so requesting such
information an Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement and (2) the Company has
promptly provided or made available to Parent any non-public information
concerning the Company or any of its Subsidiaries that is provided or made
available to any such Person and that was not previously provided or made
available to Parent; or (y) contacting and engaging in any negotiations or
discussions with any Person or group and their respective Representatives who
has made such Acquisition Proposal. As promptly as reasonably practicable (and
in any event no later than twenty-four (24) hours) following the receipt
thereof (in each case, after the Solicitation Period End Time (or, in the case
of an Excluded Party, the Cut-Off Time)), the Company shall (A) notify Parent
in writing of the receipt of any Acquisition Proposal or any inquiry or
request with respect to, or that could reasonably be expected to lead to an
Acquisition Proposal, which notice shall include the material terms and
conditions (whether written or oral) of such Acquisition Proposal, and (B)
deliver to Parent copies of all written proposals, letters of interest, term
sheets, commitment letters, proposed definitive documents or similar documents
relating to any Acquisition Proposal received by the Company or its
Representatives from any such offeror or its Representatives. After the
Solicitation Period End Time (or, in the case of an Excluded Party, the Cut-
Off Time), the Company will keep Parent reasonably informed in all material
respects of any material developments with respect to any such Acquisition
Proposal (and any subsequent amendments or modifications thereto) and deliver
copies of revised or newly received documents received by the Company or its
Representatives from any such offeror or its Representatives to Parent, in
each case, as soon as is reasonably practicable and in any event within
twenty-four (24) hours of receipt, provision or occurrence thereof.
The Company shall, as soon as is reasonably practicable and in any event
within twenty-four (24) hours following a determination by the Special
Committee that an Acquisition Proposal is a Superior Proposal, notify Parent
of such determination.

 

(e) Except as expressly permitted by _Section_ __ _ 5.5(f)_ or  _Section_
__ _ 5.5(g)_, prior to obtaining the Company Stockholder Approval, the
Company Board or the Special Committee shall not (i) withdraw, change, amend,
modify or qualify or publicly propose to withdraw, change, amend, modify or
qualify, in a manner adverse to Parent or Merger Sub, the Company Board
Recommendation, (ii) fail to include the Company Board Recommendation in the
Proxy Statement, (iii) recommend the approval or adoption of, or approve
or adopt, or publicly propose to recommend, approve or adopt, any Acquisition
Proposal, (iv) fail to recommend, in a Solicitation/Recommendation Statement
on Schedule 14D-9, against any Acquisition Proposal subject to Regulation 14D
under the Exchange Act within ten (10) Business Days after commencement of
such Acquisition Proposal (v) after the Solicitation Period End Time (or, in
the case of an Excluded Party, the Cut-Off Time), fail

 



-37- 

    

 to recommend against any Acquisition Proposal that has been publicly made,
proposed or communicated (and not publicly withdrawn) within ten (10) Business
Days of receipt of a written request from Parent to do so, or (vi) after the
Solicitation Period End Time (or, in the case of an Excluded Party, the Cut-
Off Time), fail to reaffirm the Company Recommendation following an
Acquisition Proposal having been publicly made, proposed or communicated (and
not publicly withdrawn) within ten (10) Business Days of receipt of a written
request from the Parent to do so (provided that the Company Board or the
Special Committee shall not be required to make such reaffirmation more than
one time with respect to any given Acquisition Proposal unless there shall
have been a publicly disclosed change regarding such Acquisition Proposal,
and, provided, further, that such reaffirmation may include such additional
disclosures as the Company reasonably determines to be required under
applicable securities laws) (any action prohibited by this _clause (e)_ being
referred to as an " _Adverse Company_ _Board Recommendation Change_ ").

(f) Notwithstanding anything in this _Section_ __ _ 5.5_ to the contrary,
at any time prior to obtaining the Company Stockholder Approval, if the
Company receives a bona fide written Acquisition Proposal that did not result
from a material breach of this _Section_ __ _ 5.5_, the Special Committee
may (x) make an Adverse Company Board Recommendation Change with respect to
such Acquisition Proposal or (y) recommend any such Acquisition Proposal and
cause the Company to terminate this Agreement in order to enter into
a definitive agreement with respect to such Acquisition Proposal, in each
such case if (A) the Special Committee shall have determined in good faith,
after consultation with its financial advisors and outside legal counsel, that
such Acquisition Proposal, if accepted, is a Superior Proposal and (B) the
Special Committee shall have determined in good faith, after consultation with
its outside legal counsel, that its failure to recommend that the Company
Board effect an Adverse Company Board Recommendation Change with respect to
such Acquisition Proposal or to terminate this Agreement in order to enter
into a definitive agreement with respect to such Acquisition Proposal, would
reasonably be expected to be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties to the
stockholders of the Company under applicable Law; _provided_ , that the
Company Board may not effect an Adverse Company Board Recommendation Change or
terminate this Agreement pursuant to the foregoing unless:

 

(i) the Company shall have provided prior written notice to Parent, at
least three (3) Business Days in advance (the " _Superior Proposal Notice
Period_ "), of its intention to effect such an Adverse Company Board
Recommendation Change or termination (which notice itself shall not constitute
an Adverse Company Board Recommendation Change or termination) with respect
to such Superior Proposal, which notice shall specify the material terms and
conditions of such Superior Proposal;

 

(ii) if requested by Parent, the Company shall have been available to
negotiate with, and shall have directed its Representatives to negotiate
with, Parent in good faith during the Superior Proposal Notice Period in order
to enable Parent to revise the terms of this Agreement in such a manner that
would eliminate the need for taking such action (and would cause such
Superior Proposal to no longer constitute a Superior Proposal);

 

(iii) following the Superior Proposal Notice Period and after considering
the results of any negotiations and giving effect to any amendments or
modifications made or agreed to in writing by Parent, if any, the Special
Committee (after consultation with its financial advisor and outside legal
counsel) shall have determined in good faith, that such Superior Proposal
continues to constitute a Superior Proposal (it being understood and agreed
that any change to the financial or other material terms of an Acquisition
Proposal that was previously the subject of a notice hereunder shall require
a new notice to Parent as provided above, but with respect to any such
subsequent notices the Superior Proposal Notice Period shall be deemed to be
two (2) Business Days rather than three (3) Business Days); and

 

(iv) if the Company Board or the Special Committee determines to terminate
this Agreement pursuant to the foregoing, the Company pays the applicable
Company Termination Fee to Parent prior to or concurrently with such
termination.

 

(g) Notwithstanding anything in this _Section_ __ _ 5.5_ to the contrary,
at any time prior to obtaining the Company Stockholder Approval, the Company
Board (at the recommendation of the Special Committee) may

 



-38- 

    

 make an Adverse Company Board Recommendation Change with respect to an
Intervening Event, if the Special Committee determines in good faith, after
consultation with its financial advisors and outside legal counsel, that its
failure to effect an Adverse Company Board Recommendation Change with respect
to an Intervening Event would reasonably be expected to be inconsistent with
its fiduciary duties to the stockholders of the Company under applicable Law;
_provided_ , that the Special Committee may not recommend that the Company
Board effect such an Adverse Company Board Recommendation Change unless:

 

(i) the Company shall have provided prior written notice to Parent at least
three (3) Business Days in advance (the " _Intervening Event Notice Period_
") of its intention to effect such an Adverse Company Board Recommendation
Change (which notice itself shall not constitute an Adverse Company Board
Recommendation Change), which notice shall specify the material details of
such Intervening Event;

(ii) if requested by Parent, the Company shall have been available to
negotiate with, and shall have directed its Representatives to negotiate with,
Parent in good faith during the Intervening Event Notice Period in order to
enable Parent to revise the terms of this Agreement so that the failure to
make such an Adverse Company Board Recommendation Change would no longer be
inconsistent with the directors exercise of their fiduciary duties to the
Companys stockholder under applicable Law; and

 

(iii) following the Intervening Event Notice Period and after considering
the results of any negotiations and giving effect to any amendments or
modifications made or agreed to, in writing, by Parent, if any, the Special
Committee (after consultation with its financial advisor and outside legal
counsel) shall have determined in good faith, that the failure to make such
an Adverse Company Board Recommendation Change continues to reasonably be
expected to be inconsistent with the directors exercise of their fiduciary
duties to the Companys stockholder under applicable Law (it being understood
and agreed that any material changes to the circumstances surrounding the
Intervening Event that was previously the subject of a notice hereunder shall
require a new notice to Parent as provided above, but with respect to
any such subsequent notices the Intervening Event Notice Period shall be
deemed to be two (2) Business Days rather than three (3) Business Days).

 

(h) For purposes of this Agreement, the following terms shall have the
meanings assigned below:

 

(i) " _Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement_ " means a confidentiality
agreement that contains provisions that are, as determined in good faith by
the Company, no less favorable in the aggregate to the Company than those

any manner the Companys ability to consummate the transactions contemplated

determine to be necessary under applicable Law).

the stockholders of the Company than the transactions contemplated hereby
(including any changes to the terms of the Merger and this Agreement agreed to
in writing by Parent in accordance with  _Section_ __ _ 5.5(f)_) and (ii)
reasonably likely to be consummated in accordance with its terms, taking into

Section 5.6 _Stockholders_ __ _Meeting_. The Company shall (a) no later
than the fifth (5th) Business Day following the date on which it receives
confirmation from the SEC that it will not review, or that it has completed
its review of, the Proxy Statement (which confirmation will be deemed to occur
if (x) the SEC has not affirmatively notified the Company prior to the end of
the tenth (10th) day after the date on which the Company is deemed to have
filed the preliminary Proxy Statement that the SEC will or will not be
reviewing the Proxy Statement and (y) the SEC advises the Companys counsel
that it will not provide confirmation regarding such review status), take all
required or reasonably necessary action to commence the process by which it
establishes a record date for, duly calls, gives notice of, convenes and
holds a meeting of its stockholders for the purpose of voting upon the
adoption of this Agreement in accordance with the DGCL (including any
adjournment or postponement thereof, the " _Stockholders_ __ _Meeting_ "),
with such record date being selected after reasonable consultation with Parent
and such meeting date being held no later than the later of fifty (50) days
after the dissemination of the Proxy Statement to the stockholders of the
Company in accordance with _Section_ __ _ 5.7_ and the tenth (10th) Business
Day following the day on which the Solicitation Period End Time (or, in case
there is any Excluded Party, the Cut-Off Time) occurs (or if such later day
is not a Business Day, the next succeeding Business Day) and (b) unless the
Company Board (at the recommendation of the Special Committee) has effected
an Adverse Company Board Recommendation Change in accordance with _Section_
__ _ 5.5_ or there has been an earlier valid termination of this Agreement,
use its reasonable best efforts to secure the Company Stockholder Approval at
the Stockholders Meeting. Once established, except as required by applicable
Law, the Company shall not change the record date or the meeting date for the
Stockholders Meeting without the prior written consent of Parent (such
consent not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed). Unless this
Agreement is earlier validly terminated pursuant to _Article VII_ , the
Company shall take all action required under the DGCL, the Company
Organizational Documents and the applicable requirements of Nasdaq necessary
to establish a

 



-40- 

    

 record date for, duly call, give notice of, convene and hold the
Stockholders Meeting for the purpose of voting upon the adoption of this
Agreement in accordance with the DGCL, whether or not the Company Board (at
the recommendation of the Special Committee) at any time subsequent to the
Agreement Date shall have effected an Adverse Company Board Recommendation
Change or otherwise shall have determined that this Agreement is no longer
advisable. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, nothing
will prevent the Company from postponing or adjourning the Stockholders
Meeting if (i) there are holders of an insufficient number of Shares present
or represented by proxy at the Stockholders Meeting to constitute a quorum
at the Stockholders Meeting or to adopt this Agreement or (ii) the Special
Committee has determined in good faith after consultation with its outside
legal counsel that it is required to postpone or adjourn the Stockholders
Meeting by applicable Law, Order or a request from the SEC; _provided_ , that,
without the prior written consent of Parent (such consent not to be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed), the Stockholders Meeting
will not be postponed or adjourned by more than ten (10) days unless a
lengthier period is required by applicable Law, Order or a request from the
SEC. In the case of any such adjournment or postponement pursuant to this
_Section_ __ _ 5.6_, the Company shall consult with Parent prior to making
such adjournment or postponement, and shall make such adjournment or
postponement for the minimum amount of time that may be reasonably required,
as determined by the Company in good faith after consultation with Parent. The
Company shall, unless a stockholder proposal to do so is not approved by the
stockholders of the Company, adjourn the Stockholders Meeting on one or more
occasions for an aggregate period of up to thirty (30) days if so requested by
Parent (and subsequently hold the Stockholders Meeting as promptly as
practicable after such adjournment), in each case, if, on the date for which
the Stockholders Meeting is then scheduled, the Company has not received
proxies representing a sufficient number of Shares to obtain the Company
Stockholder Approval.

 

Section 5.7 _Securities Filings_.

 

(a) As soon as reasonably practicable and in any event within twenty (20)
Business Days following the date of this Agreement, the Company shall prepare
and file with the SEC a preliminary proxy statement (as amended or
supplemented, the " _Proxy Statement_ ") relating to the Stockholders Meeting
and Parent and Merger Sub shall provide other assistance in the preparation
of the Proxy Statement as may be reasonably requested by the Company from time
to time. Subject to _Section_ __ _ 5.5(f)_ and _Section_ __ _ 5.5(g)_, the
Company shall include the Company Board Recommendation in the Proxy
Statement. The Company will cause the Proxy Statement and any Other Required
Company Filing to comply as to form in all material respects with the
applicable requirements of the Exchange Act and the rules of the SEC and
Nasdaq. Parent, Merger Sub and the Company will cooperate with each other in
the preparation of the Proxy Statement.

 

(b) Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, Parent and Merger Sub
will furnish to the Company the information relating to it required by the
Exchange Act, and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder to be set
forth in the Proxy Statement. The Company shall not file the Proxy Statement
(or any amendment or supplement thereto) or respond to SEC comments without
providing Parent and its counsel a reasonable opportunity to review and
comment thereon (which comments shall be reasonably considered by the
Company). The Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to resolve all SEC
comments with respect to the Proxy Statement as promptly as reasonably
practicable after receipt thereof and to cause the Proxy Statement in
definitive form to be cleared by the SEC and mailed to the Companys
stockholders as promptly as reasonably practicable following filing with the
SEC. If the Company determines that it is required to file any document other
than the Proxy Statement with the SEC in connection with the Merger pursuant
to applicable Law (such document, as amended or supplemented, an " _Other
Required Company Filing_ "), then the Company shall promptly prepare and file
such Other Required Company Filing with the SEC. The Company shall not file
any Other Required Company Filing (or any amendment or supplement thereto) or
respond to SEC comments without providing Parent and its counsel a reasonable
opportunity to review and comment thereon (which comments shall be reasonably
considered by the Company). The Company shall as soon as
reasonably practicable notify Parent of the receipt of any comments from the
SEC or its staff with respect to the Proxy Statement or any Other Required
Company Filing and any request by the SEC for any amendment or revisions to
the Proxy Statement or any Other Required Company Filing or for additional
information. Except as otherwise

 



-41- 

    

 required by Law, the Company and its Subsidiaries, on the one hand, and
Parent, Merger Sub and their respective Affiliates, on the other hand, may not
communicate in writing with the SEC or its staff with respect to the Proxy
Statement or any Other Required Company Filing, as the case may be, without
providing the other, a reasonable opportunity to review and comment on such
written communication and shall consider in good faith any reasonable
comments or revisions made by such reviewing party and its counsel.

(c) The Company agrees that none of the information supplied or to be
supplied by the Company for inclusion or incorporation by reference in the
Proxy Statement will, at the time of the mailing of the Proxy Statement,
including any amendments or supplements thereto, and at the time of the
Stockholders Meeting, contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit
to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order
to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which
they are made, not misleading. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company
makes no representation, warranty or covenant with respect to any information
supplied by Parent or Merger Sub or any of their respective Representatives
that is contained or incorporated by reference in the Proxy Statement. Parent
and Merger Sub agree that none of the information supplied or to be supplied
by Parent or Merger Sub in writing for inclusion or incorporation by reference
in the Proxy Statement will, at the time of the mailing of the Proxy
Statement, including any amendments or supplements thereto, and at the time of
the Stockholders Meeting, contain any untrue statement of a material fact or
omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in
order to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under
which they are made, not misleading. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no
representation or warranty is made by Parent or Merger Sub with respect
to statements made or incorporated by reference in the Proxy Statement based
on information supplied by or on behalf of the Company expressly for inclusion
or incorporation by reference therein.

 

(d) If at any time prior to the Stockholders Meeting, any information
relating to the Company, Parent, Merger Sub or any of their respective
Affiliates, directors or officers should be discovered by the Company or
Parent, which should be set forth in an amendment or supplement to the Proxy
Statement so that the Proxy Statement shall not contain any untrue statement
of a material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated
therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of the
circumstances under which they are made, not misleading, the party that
discovers such information shall promptly notify the other party, and an
appropriate amendment, supplement or other filing incorporated by reference
into the Proxy Statement describing such information shall be prepared and
filed with the SEC by the appropriate party and, to the extent required by
applicable Law, disseminated to the stockholders of the Company, in each case,
as promptly as reasonably practicable. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary in this  _Section_ __ _ 5.7_, except in connection with an Adverse
Company Board Recommendation Change in accordance with _Section_ __ _ 5.5_,
as permitted by _Section_ __ _ 5.12_, or as required by applicable Law (as
determined in good faith by the Special Committee after consulting with
outside legal counsel), no amendment or supplement to the Proxy Statement or
to an Other Required Company Filing shall be made by the Company without
the approval of Parent, which approval will not be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed.

 

Section 5.8 _Employee Matters_. With respect to employee matters, the
parties have made the agreements and covenants set forth in _Exhibit D_ to
this Agreement, which is hereby incorporated into this Agreement by reference.

 

Section 5.9 _Regulatory Approvals; Efforts_.

 

(a) Prior to the Closing, Parent, Merger Sub and the Company shall, and
shall cause their respective Affiliates to, use their respective reasonable
best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions, and to do, or cause
to be done, all things necessary, proper or advisable under any applicable
Laws to consummate and make effective the Merger as promptly as practicable,
including (i) preparing and filing all forms, registrations and notifications
with any Governmental Entities or third parties required to be filed to
consummate the Merger, (ii) using reasonable best efforts to satisfy
the conditions to consummating the Merger, (iii) using reasonable best
efforts to obtain (and to cooperate with each other in obtaining) any consent,
authorization, expiration or

 



-42- 

    

 termination of a waiting period, permit, Order or approval of, waiver or any
exemption by, any Governmental Entity required to be obtained or made by
Parent, Merger Sub, the Company or any of their respective Subsidiaries in
connection with the Merger or the taking of any action contemplated by this
Agreement, (iv) subject to the provisions of _Section_ __ _ 5.14_, defending
any lawsuits or other legal Proceedings, whether judicial or administrative,
challenging this Agreement or the consummation of the Merger and (v) using
reasonable best efforts with respect to the execution and delivery of all such
instruments, deeds, assignments or assurances and doing all other things
reasonably necessary or desirable to consummate the Merger and to fully carry
out the purposes or intent of this Agreement.

 

(b) Parent and the Company shall each keep the other apprised of the status
of matters relating to the completion of the Merger and work cooperatively in
connection with obtaining all required consents, authorizations, Orders or
approvals of, or any exemptions by, any Governmental Entity undertaken
pursuant to the provisions of this  _Section_ __ _ 5.9_. In that regard,
prior to the Closing, each party shall promptly consult with the other parties
to this Agreement with respect to and provide any necessary information and
assistance as the other parties may reasonably request with respect to all
notices, submissions or filings made by or on behalf of such party or any of
its Affiliates with any Governmental Entity or any other information supplied
by or on behalf of such party or any of its Affiliates to, or correspondence
with, a Governmental Entity in connection with this Agreement and the Merger.
Each party to this Agreement shall promptly inform the other parties to this
Agreement, and if in writing, furnish the other parties with copies of (or,
in the case of oral communications, advise the other parties orally of) any
communication from or to any Governmental Entity regarding the Merger, and
permit the other parties to review and discuss in advance, and consider in
good faith the views of the other parties in connection with, any proposed
communication or submission with any such Governmental Entity. To the extent
not prohibited by the applicable Governmental Entity, no party or any of its
Affiliates shall participate in any meeting or teleconference with any
Governmental Entity in connection with this Agreement and the Merger unless it
consults with the other parties in advance and gives the other parties the
opportunity to attend and participate thereat. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
Parent and the Company may, as each deems advisable and necessary, reasonably
designate any competitively sensitive material provided to the other under
this _Section_ __ _ 5.9(b)_ as " _Antitrust Counsel Only Material_." Such
materials and the information contained therein shall be given only to the
outside counsel of the recipient and will not be disclosed by such outside
counsel to employees, officers or directors of the recipient unless express
written permission is obtained in advance from the source of the materials
(Parent or the Company, as the case may be) or its legal counsel. Materials
provided pursuant to this  _Section_ __ _ 5.9_ may be redacted (i) to remove
references concerning the valuation of the Company and the Merger, (ii) as
necessary to comply with contractual arrangements and (iii) as necessary to
address reasonable privilege concerns. In addition to the foregoing
provisions of this _Section_ __ _ 5.9(b)_, a party hereto may request entry
into a joint defense agreement as a condition to providing any materials
hereunder. Upon delivery of such a request, the parties shall work in good
faith to enter into a joint defense agreement to create and preserve attorney-
client privilege in a form and substance mutually acceptable to the parties.

 

(c) The Company and Parent shall make or file, as promptly as practicable,
with the appropriate Governmental Entity all filings, forms, registrations
and notifications required to be filed to consummate the Merger under the
Israeli Economic Competition Law or any applicable antitrust Law, and
subsequent to such filings, the Company and Parent shall, and shall
cause their respective Affiliates to, as promptly as practicable, respond to
inquiries from Governmental Entities, or provide any supplemental information
that may be requested by Governmental Entities, in connection with filings
made with such Governmental Entities. The Company and Parent shall promptly
file any notifications and report forms (that are comparable to the
notification and report forms under the HSR Act) under any other applicable
antitrust Law.

 

(d) In furtherance and not in limitation of the covenants of the parties
contained in this  _Section_ __ _ 5.9_, if any administrative or judicial
action or Proceeding, including any Proceeding by a private party, is
instituted (or threatened to be instituted) challenging the Merger or any
other transaction contemplated by this Agreement as violative of any
antitrust Law, each of the Company and Parent shall use reasonable best
efforts to contest and resist any such action or Proceeding and to have
vacated, lifted, reversed or overturned any decree, judgment, 

 



-43- 

    

 injunction or other Order, whether temporary, preliminary or permanent, that
is in effect and that prohibits, prevents or restricts consummation of the
Merger.

 

(e) Except as specifically required by this Agreement, from the date hereof
until the earlier of the Effective Time and the valid termination of this
Agreement in accordance with _Section_ __ _ 7.1_, Parent shall not, and shall
not permit any of its Affiliates to, acquire or agree to acquire by merging or
consolidating with, or by purchasing a substantial portion of the assets of
or equity in, or by any other manner, any Person or portion thereof, or
otherwise acquire or agree to acquire any assets, if the entering into of a
definitive agreement relating to or the consummation of such acquisition,
merger or consolidation would reasonably be expected to (i) impose any
material delay in the obtaining of any consent, approval, authorization,
declaration, waiver, license, franchise, permit, certificate or order of
any Governmental Entity necessary to consummate the transactions contemplated
hereby or the expiration or termination of any applicable waiting period or
(ii) materially delay the consummation of the transactions contemplated
hereby.

 

(f) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall use its reasonable best
efforts to promptly obtain any consents of third parties with respect to any
Company Material Contracts, as may be necessary or appropriate for the
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby or required by the terms
of any such Company Material Contract as a result of the execution,
performance or consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby, in each
case to the extent reasonably requested in writing by Parent, subject to the
proviso in the immediately following sentence. In the event that such third
party consent described in this _Section_ __ _ 5.9(f)_ shall not be
obtained, the Company and Parent shall determine reasonably and jointly
whether to take any further actions with respect to such Company Material
Contracts;  _provided_ , that without its consent (such consent to be given
or withheld in its sole discretion), the Company shall not be required to pay
any amount or change Contract terms or its business practices in order to
obtain any such consent.

 

Section 5.10 _102 Tax Ruling_. As soon as practicable after the date of
this Agreement, the Company shall instruct its Israeli counsel to prepare and
file with the ITA an application for a ruling (which shall be approved by
Parent prior to its submission and which approval shall not be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned or delayed) confirming that (i) the conversion of
Section 102 Shares into the right to receive the Section 102 Shares
Consideration in accordance with Section 2.1(a), shall not be regarded as a
violation of the "requisite holding period" (as such term is defined in
Section 102) so long as the Section 102 Shares Consideration is deposited with
the 102 Trustee until the end of the respective holding period, and (ii) the
deposit of the Section 102 Shares Consideration with the Paying Agent and the
102 Trustee shall not be subject to any withholding obligation (which ruling
may be subject to customary conditions regularly associated with such a
ruling) (the " _102 Tax Ruling_ "). The Company shall include in the request
for the 102 Tax Ruling a request to exempt Parent, the Surviving Corporation,
the Paying Agent and their respective agents from any withholding obligation
with respect to payments made to the 102 Trustee. If the 102 Tax Ruling is
not granted prior to the Closing or in accordance with the instructions of the
ITA, the Company shall seek to obtain prior to the Closing an interim tax
ruling confirming, among other things, that Parent and any Person acting on
its behalf (including the Paying Agent) shall be exempt from Israeli
withholding Tax in relation to any payments made with respect to any Section
102 Shares to the Paying Agent, the 102 Trustee or the Company in connection
with the Merger (the " _Interim 102 Tax Ruling_ "). To the extent that prior
to the Closing an Interim 102 Tax Ruling shall have been obtained, then all
references in this Agreement to the 102 Tax Ruling shall be deemed to refer
to such Interim 102 Tax Ruling, until such time that a final definitive 102
Tax Ruling is obtained.

 

Section 5.11 _Takeover Statutes_. If any Takeover Statute may become, or
may purport to be, applicable to this Agreement, the Merger or any other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, each of the Company and Parent
and their respective boards of directors shall grant such approvals and take
such actions as are reasonably necessary so that the Merger and the other
transactions contemplated hereby may be consummated as promptly as practicable
on the terms contemplated hereby and otherwise act to eliminate, or otherwise
minimize, the effects of such Takeover Statute on the Merger and the other
transactions contemplated hereby. Nothing in this _Section_ __ _ 5.11_ shall
be construed to permit Parent or Merger Sub to do any act that would
constitute a violation or breach of, or as a waiver of any of the Companys
rights under, any other provision of this Agreement.

 



-44- 

    

Section 5.12 _Public Announcements_. The Company and Parent agree that
the initial press release to be issued with respect to the execution and
delivery of this Agreement and the Companys Current Report on Form
8-K disclosing the execution of this Agreement shall be in the form
heretofore agreed to by the parties and that the parties shall consult with
each other before issuing any other press release or making any other public
announcement with respect to this Agreement and the transactions contemplated
hereby and shall not issue any such press release or make any such public
announcement without the prior consent of the other party (which shall not be
unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned);  _provided_ , that a party
may, without the prior consent of the other party, issue such press release or
make such public announcement (a) so long as such statements are not
inconsistent with previous statements made jointly by, or with the approval
of, the Company and Parent or (b) (after prior consultation, to the extent
practicable in the circumstances) to the extent required by applicable Law or
the applicable rules of any stock exchange. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
the restrictions set forth in this _Section_ __ _ 5.12_ shall not apply to
(i) any public release or public announcement (x) made or proposed to be made
by the Company in connection with an Acquisition Proposal, a
Superior Proposal, an Adverse Company Board Recommendation Change or an
Intervening Event or any action taken pursuant thereto, in each case, that
does not violate _Section_ __ _ 5.5_ or (y) in connection with any dispute
between the parties regarding this Agreement or the transactions contemplated
hereby or (ii) ordinary course communications by Parent, Merger Sub and their
respective Affiliates regarding this Agreement and the transactions
contemplated hereby to existing or prospective general and limited partners,
equity holders, members, managers and investors of any Affiliates of such
Person, in each case, who are subject to customary confidentiality
restrictions.

 

Section 5.13 _Indemnification and Insurance_.

 

(a) For six (6) years from and after the Effective Time, the Surviving
Corporation shall, and Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to,
indemnify and hold harmless all past and present directors and officers of the
Company and each of its Subsidiaries and each Person who served as a director,
officer, member, trustee or fiduciary of another corporation, partnership,
joint venture, trust, pension or other employee benefit plan or enterprise at
the request or for the benefit of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
(collectively, together with such Persons heirs, executors and
administrators, the " _Covered Persons_ ") to the same extent such Persons
are indemnified as of the date of this Agreement by the Company pursuant to
the Company Organizational Documents, the certificate of incorporation and
bylaws, or equivalent organizational or governing documents, of any
Subsidiary of the Company and indemnification agreements, if any, in existence
on the date of this Agreement with any directors, officers and employees that
have been made available to Parent (collectively, the " _Existing
Indemnification Arrangements_ ") arising out of acts or omissions in their
capacity as directors or officers of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries,
or any other Person serving in such capacities of another entity or
enterprise at the request or for the benefit of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries, occurring at or prior to the Effective Time. Without limiting
the foregoing, from and after the Effective Time, the Surviving
Corporation shall, and Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to,
indemnify and hold harmless the Covered Persons to the fullest extent
permitted by Law for acts or omissions occurring in connection with the
process resulting in and the adoption of this Agreement and the consummation
of the transactions contemplated hereby. From and after the Effective Time,
subject to any requirements of applicable Law, the Surviving Corporation
shall, and Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, advance expenses
(including reasonable legal fees and expenses) incurred in the defense of any
actual or threatened Proceeding or investigation with respect to the matters
subject to indemnification pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 5.13(a)_ if
required by the Existing Indemnification Arrangements. Notwithstanding
anything herein to the contrary, if any Proceeding or investigation (whether
arising before, at or after the Effective Time) is made or threatened against
such Persons with respect to matters subject to indemnification or
advancement hereunder on or prior to the sixth (6th) anniversary of the
Effective Time, the provisions of this _Section_ __ _ 5.13(a)_ shall continue
in effect until the final disposition of such Proceeding or investigation.

(b) For not less than seven (7) years from and after the Effective Time,
the certificate of incorporation and bylaws of the Surviving Corporation and
the organizational documents of each Subsidiary of the Company shall contain
provisions no less favorable with respect to exculpation, indemnification
of and

 



-45- 

    

 advancement of expenses to Covered Persons for periods at or prior to the
Effective Time than are set forth in _Exhibits B_ and _C_ annexed hereto. To
the extent permitted by applicable Law, indemnification agreements, if any,
in existence on the date of this Agreement with any directors, officers and
employees that have been made available to Parent shall continue in full force
and effect in accordance with their terms following the Effective Time.

(c) For a period of six (6) years from the Effective Time, the Surviving
Corporation shall, and Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to,
maintain in effect policies of directors and officers liability insurance
and fiduciary liability insurance that collectively provide coverage for
matters arising on or before the Effective Time (the " _D andO Insurance_")
that is substantially equivalent to and in any event not less favorable in the
aggregate than the existing policies of the Company and the Company
Subsidiaries (true and complete copies of which have been previously made
available to Parent) or, if substantially equivalent insurance coverage is
unavailable, the best available coverage; _provided_ , _however_ , that after
the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall not be required to pay
annual premiums for the DandO Insurance in excess of three hundred percent
(300%) of the last annual premium paid by the Company prior to the date
hereof, but in such case shall purchase as much coverage as
reasonably practicable for such amount. In lieu of the foregoing, the Company
may purchase, prior to the Effective Time, at prevailing market rates, a six
(6)-year prepaid "tail" policy on terms and conditions providing substantially
equivalent benefits as the current policies of directors and officers
liability insurance and fiduciary liability insurance maintained by the
Company and its Subsidiaries with respect to matters arising on or before the
Effective Time, covering without limitation the transactions contemplated
hereby and full prior acts coverage for all acts or omissions taking place
before the tail becomes effective.

 

(d) In the event that Parent or the Surviving Corporation (i) consolidates
with or merges into any other Person and shall not be the continuing or
surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation or merger or (ii)
transfers all or substantially all of its properties and assets to any Person,
then proper provision shall be made so that such continuing or surviving
corporation or entity or transferee of such assets, as the case may be, shall
assume all of the obligations set forth in this _Section_ __ _ 5.13_.

 

(e) This covenant is intended to be for the benefit of, and shall be
enforceable by, each of the Covered Persons. The rights to indemnification,
advancement, exculpation, insurance coverage and the other rights provided for
herein shall not be deemed exclusive of any other rights to which any Covered
Person is entitled, whether pursuant to Law, Contract or otherwise.

Section 5.14 _Transaction Litigation_. Each party shall promptly (and in
any event, within two (2) Business Days) notify the other parties hereto in
writing of any Proceedings brought or threatened in writing by any stockholder
of the Company or any other Person against it, its affiliates or its or
their directors or executive officers or other Representatives relating to
this Agreement, the Merger or the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement and shall keep the other parties hereto informed on a reasonably
current basis with respect to the status thereof (including by promptly
furnishing to the other parties hereto and their Representatives such
information relating to such Proceedings as may be reasonably requested). Each
party shall give the other parties hereto the opportunity to participate in
(but not control) the defense or settlement of any Proceeding against it, its
affiliates or its or their directors or officers or other Representatives
relating to this Agreement, the Merger or the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement and shall give due consideration to such other
parties advice with respect to such Proceeding and the Company shall not
settle or agree to settle any such Proceeding without Parents prior written
consent (which shall not be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned).
For purposes of this _Section_ __ _ 5.14_, "participate" means that the non-
litigating party will be kept apprised by the litigating party of proposed
strategy and other significant decisions with respect to the stockholder
litigation or Proceedings contemplated by this _Section_ __ _ 5.14_ (to the
extent that the attorney-client privilege between the litigating party and
its counsel is not undermined or otherwise affected, _provided_ , that the
litigating party shall inform the other party of the general nature of the
information being withheld and, upon such other partys request, reasonably
cooperate with such other party to provide such information, in whole or in
part, to the extent and in a manner that would not result in any of the
foregoing outcomes), and the non-litigating party may offer comments or

 



-46- 

    

 suggestions with respect to such stockholder litigation or Proceedings but
will not be afforded any decision-making power or other authority over such
stockholder litigation or Proceedings.

 

Section 5.15 _Stock Exchange Delisting; Deregistration_. Prior to the
Effective Time, the Company shall, and, following the Effective Time, Parent
shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, use reasonable best efforts to take,
or cause to be taken, all actions, and do or cause to be done all things,
necessary, proper or advisable on its part under applicable Law and rules and
policies of Nasdaq to cause the delisting of the Company and of the Shares
from Nasdaq as promptly as practicable after the Effective Time and the
deregistration of the Shares under the Exchange Act as promptly as
practicable after such delisting.

 

Section 5.16 _Section 16 Matters_. Prior to the Effective Time, the
Company shall take all such steps as may be required to cause any
dispositions of Shares (including derivative securities with respect to
Shares) resulting from the transactions contemplated by this Agreement by each
individual who is subject to the reporting requirements of Section 16(a) of
the Exchange Act with respect to the Company, to be exempt under Rule 16b-3
promulgated under the Exchange Act.

(the " _End Date_ "); _provided_ , that the right to terminate this Agreement
pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 7.1(b)_ shall not be available to a party if

the applicable condition not to be satisfied;

Section 7.2 _Effect of Termination_. In the event of a valid termination
of this Agreement pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 7.1_, this Agreement shall
terminate (except that the Confidentiality Agreement and the provisions of
_Section_ __ _ 5.4(c)_, _Section_ __ _ 5.12_, this  _Section_ __ _ 7.2_,
_Section_ __ _ 7.3_ and _Article VIII_ and all defined terms appearing in

Liability on the part of the Company, on the one hand, or Parent or Merger
Sub, on the other hand, to the other except as provided in the Confidentiality
Agreement and the provisions of _Section_ __ _ 5.4(c)_, _Section_ __ _
5.12_, this  _Section 7.2_, _Section_ __ _ 7.3_ and _Article VIII_ ;
_provided_ , that, subject in all respects to the limitations set forth in
this _Section_ __ _ 7.2_, _Section_ __ _ 7.3_ (Termination Fees), _Section_
__ _ 8.5_ (Remedies) and _Section_ __ _ 8.15_ (Non-Recourse), nothing herein
shall relieve (x) the Company from any Liability resulting from fraud or a

forth in this Agreement prior to such valid termination or (y) Parent from any
Liability resulting from fraud or a Willful Breach of its representations,
warranties, covenants or agreements set forth in this Agreement prior to such
valid termination of this Agreement. Notwithstanding anything in this
Agreement to the contrary, in no event will the Parent Related
Parties, collectively, have any Liability for monetary damages (including
damages for fraud or breach, whether willful, intentional, unintentional or
otherwise (including Willful Breach) or monetary damages in lieu of specific
performance) in the aggregate in excess of the Maximum Liability Amount and
subject in all respects to the limitations set forth in _Section  7.3(f)_.

Section 7.3 _Termination Fee_.

 

(a) In the event that:

 

(i) this Agreement is validly terminated by Parent pursuant to  _Section_
__ _ 7.1(e)(ii)_ or by the Company pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 7.1(d)(ii)_,
then the Company shall pay $2,400,000 (the " _Company Termination Fee_ ") to
Parent, such payment to be made (x) in the case of a termination pursuant to
_Section_ __ _ 7.1(e)(ii)_, within two (2) Business Days after such
termination and (y) in the case of a

 



-50- 

    

 termination pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 7.1(d)(ii)_, prior to or
concurrently with such termination, in each case payable by wire transfer of
same day funds to an account designated in writing by Parent (such written
instruction to be provided promptly after such payment becomes due and payable
under this _Section_ __ _ 7.3_); or

 

(ii) this Agreement is validly terminated by (x) Parent or the Company
pursuant to  _Section_ __ _ 7.1(b)_ or _Section_ __ _ 7.1(f)_ or (y) by
Parent pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 7.1(e)(i)_, and (A) following the date
hereof and prior to such termination, an Acquisition Proposal shall have been
made to the Company Board or shall have been publicly made directly to the
Companys stockholders generally or shall have otherwise become publicly known
(and, in each such case, such Acquisition Proposal shall not have been
publicly withdrawn prior to the time of termination or, in the case of a
termination pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 7.1(f)_, prior to the date of
completion of the Stockholders Meeting) and (B) within twelve (12) months
after such termination, the Company enters into an Alternative Acquisition
Agreement with respect to an Acquisition Proposal which is ultimately
consummated or consummates an Acquisition Proposal (which need not be the
same Acquisition Proposal that was made, announced or publicly known prior to
the termination hereof), then in each case the Company shall pay to Parent the
Company Termination Fee, by wire transfer of same day funds to an account
designated in writing by Parent (such written instruction to be provided
promptly after such payment becomes due and payable under this _Section_ __ _
7.3_), concurrently with the consummation of such Acquisition Proposal. For
the purposes of this  _Section_ __ _ 7.3(a)(ii)_, all references to "twenty
percent (20%)" in the definition of Acquisition Proposal will be deemed
references to "fifty percent (50%)". Any Parent Expenses paid by the Company
to Parent pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 7.3(c)_ shall be credited against, and
shall thereby reduce, the amount of the Company Termination Fee that otherwise
would be required to be paid by the Company to Parent pursuant to this 
_Section_ __ _ 7.3(a)(ii)_.

(b) In the event that this Agreement is validly terminated by the Company
pursuant to (i) _Section 7.1(d)(i)_, (ii) _Section_ __ _ 7.1(b)_ if the
Company would then be entitled to terminate this Agreement pursuant to
_Section_ __ _ 7.1(d)(i)_ or (iii) _Section 7.1(g)_, in each case of the
foregoing _clauses (i)_ through _(iii)_ , Parent shall pay to the Company
within two (2) Business Days after such termination, $3,200,000 (the " _Parent
Termination Fee_ "), payable by wire transfer of same day funds to an account
designated in writing by the Company (such written instruction to be provided
promptly after such payment becomes due and payable under this  _Section_ __
_ 7.3_).

(c) In the event that this Agreement is validly terminated by
Parent pursuant to _Section 7.1(e)(ii)_, then the Company shall pay to
Parent an amount equal to that required to reimburse Parent, Merger Sub and
their respective Affiliates for all reasonable and documented out-of-pocket
fees and expenses incurred in connection with this Agreement and the
transactions contemplated hereby up to $800,000 (the " _Parent Expenses_ ").

 

(d) For purposes of this Agreement, " _Excluded Party_ " means any Person
or group of Persons from which the Company receives, after the execution of
this Agreement and at or prior to the Solicitation Period End Time, a written
Acquisition Proposal that remains pending as of, and has not been withdrawn
prior to, the Solicitation Period End Time;  _provided_ , that (1) the
Special Committee determines in good faith (after consultation with the
Companys financial advisors and outside legal counsel), not later than the
Solicitation Period End Time, that such Acquisition Proposal constitutes a
Superior Proposal or that such Acquisition Proposal is reasonably likely to
lead to a Superior Proposal, and (2) the Company provides written notice to
Parent of such determination, no later than twenty-four (24) hours after the
Solicitation Period End Time; _provided_ , _further_ , that a Person or group
shall cease to be an Excluded Party upon the withdrawal, termination,
expiration or abandonment of such Acquisition Proposal (as it may be amended
or modified).

(e) Each of the parties hereto acknowledges that (i) each of the Company
Termination Fee and the Parent Expenses is not intended to be a penalty but
rather is liquidated damages in a reasonable amount that will compensate
Parent in the circumstances in which such fee and expenses are due and
payable, for the efforts and 

 



-51- 

    

 resources expended and opportunities foregone while negotiating this
Agreement and in reliance on this Agreement and on the expectation of the
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby, which amount would
otherwise be impossible to calculate with precision and (ii) the Parent
Termination Fee is not intended to be a penalty but rather is liquidated
damages in a reasonable amount that will compensate the Company in
the circumstances in which such fee is due and payable, for the efforts and
resources expended and opportunities foregone while negotiating this Agreement
and in reliance on this Agreement and on the expectation of the consummation
of the transactions contemplated hereby, which amount would otherwise be
impossible to calculate with precision. In no event shall the Company be
required to pay the Company Termination Fee on more than one occasion or shall
Parent be required to pay the Parent Termination Fee on more than one
occasion.

(f) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement or
any documents executed in connection with this Agreement or the transactions
contemplated hereby, but subject to Section 8.5, the maximum aggregate
Liability, whether in equity or at Law, in Contract, in tort or otherwise,
together with any payment of the Parent Termination Fee or the Company
Termination Fee, as applicable, and any other payment in connection with this
Agreement or otherwise, of the Parent Related Parties or the Company Related
Parties, as applicable, collectively (including monetary damages for fraud or
breach, whether willful, intentional, unintentional or otherwise, or monetary
damages in lieu of specific performance) (i) under this Agreement or any other
document or instrument delivered in connection hereunder (excluding the
Confidentiality Agreement), (ii) in connection with the failure of the Merger
or the other transactions contemplated hereby to be consummated or (iii) in
respect of any representation or warranty made or alleged to have been
made in connection with this Agreement or any documents executed in
connection with this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby, will
not exceed under any circumstances an amount equal to (y) with respect to the
Parent Related Parties, the Parent Termination Fee, if any, due and owing to
the Company pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 7.3(b)_, or, with respect to the
Company Related Parties, the Company Termination Fee and the Parent Expenses,
if any, due and owing to Parent pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 7.3(a)_ and
_Section_ __ _ 7.3(c)_, respectively, plus (z) the Companys or Parents, as
applicable, Enforcement Costs (collectively, with respect to the
Parent Related Parties or the Company Related Parties, as applicable, the "
_Maximum Liability Amount_ "); provided, that in no event will the Parent
Related Parties or the Company Related Parties seek, directly or indirectly,
to recover against the Company Related Parties or the Parent Related Parties,
as applicable, or compel payment by the Company Related Parties or the Parent
Related Parties, as applicable, of, any damages or other payments whatsoever
(including multiple, consequential, indirect, special, statutory, exemplary
or punitive damages) in excess of the Maximum Liability Amount of the Company
Related Parties or the Parent Related Parties, as applicable, set forth in
this  _Section_ __ _ 7.3(f)_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in
this Agreement, if the Company or Parent initiates any Proceeding (or portion
thereof) to enforce its rights under this Agreement, then the prevailing party
in such action shall be entitled to payment of its costs and expenses
(including attorneys fees) in connection with such suit, together with
interest on the amount of such amount or portion thereof at the U.S. prime
rate as of the trading day on the date such payment was required to be made
through the date of payment (the " _Enforcement Costs_ "); provided that the
Liability of the Company for payment of the Enforcement Costs shall not exceed
$2,000,000 in the aggregate in respect of such Proceeding (or portion
thereof) by the non-prevailing party. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
in this _Section_ __ _ 7.3(f)_, it is understood and agreed that nothing in
this Agreement shall limit any rights the Company or Parent may have in
respect of the Confidentiality Agreement.

 

(g) Each of the parties hereto acknowledges that the agreements contained
in this _Section_ __ _ 7.3_ are an integral part of the transactions
contemplated hereby, and that, without these agreements, the Company, Parent
and Merger Sub would not enter into this Agreement.

Time or otherwise expressly by the terms hereof survive the Effective Time.

 

Section 8.2 _Expenses; Transfer Taxes_.

 

(a) Except as otherwise provided in this Agreement, whether or not the
Merger is consummated, all costs and expenses incurred in connection with the

other parties. Signatures to this Agreement transmitted by facsimile
transmission, by electronic mail in "portable document format" (".pdf") form,
or by any other electronic means intended to preserve the original graphic
and pictorial appearance of a document, will have the same effect as physical

Section 8.4 _Governing Law; Jurisdiction_.

 

(a) This Agreement, and all claims or causes of action (whether at Law, in
Contract or in tort or otherwise) that may be based upon, arise out of or
relate to this Agreement or the negotiation, execution or performance hereof,
shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the Laws of the State of
Delaware, without giving effect to any choice or conflict of law provision or
rule (whether of the State of Delaware or any other jurisdiction) that would
cause the application of the Laws of any jurisdiction other than the State of
Delaware.

 

(b) Each of the parties hereto irrevocably agrees that any Proceeding with
respect to this Agreement and the rights and obligations arising hereunder,
or for recognition and enforcement of any judgment in respect of this
Agreement and the rights and obligations arising hereunder brought by the
other party hereto or its successors or assigns, shall be brought
and determined exclusively in the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware
or, if the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware does not have subject
matter jurisdiction over such matter, then in any state or federal court
located in the State of Delaware (such courts, collectively, the " _Chosen
Courts_ "). Each of the parties hereto hereby irrevocably submits with regard
to any such Proceeding for itself and in respect of its property, generally
and unconditionally, to the personal jurisdiction of the Chosen Courts and
agrees that it will not bring any action relating to this Agreement or any of
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement in any court other than the
Chosen Courts. Each of the parties hereto hereby irrevocably waives, and
agrees not to assert, by way of motion, as a defense, counterclaim or
otherwise, in any Proceeding with respect to this Agreement, (A) any claim
that it is not personally subject to the jurisdiction of the Chosen
Courts, (B) any claim that it or its property is exempt or immune from
jurisdiction of any such court or from any legal process commenced in such
courts (whether through service of notice, attachment prior to judgment,
attachment in aid of execution of judgment, execution of judgment or
otherwise) and (C) to the fullest extent permitted by applicable Law, any
claim that (1) the Proceeding in such court is brought in an inconvenient
forum, (2) the venue of such Proceeding is improper or (3) this Agreement, or
the subject matter hereof, may not be enforced in or by such courts. Each
party hereto expressly acknowledges that the foregoing waiver is intended to
be irrevocable under the Law of the State of Delaware and of the United
States of America; _provided_ , _however_ , that each such partys consent to
jurisdiction and service contained in this _Section_ __ _ 8.4_ is solely for
the

 



-53- 

    

 purpose referred to in this _Section_ __ _ 8.4_ and shall not be deemed to
be a general submission to said courts or in the State of Delaware other than
for such purpose. To the fullest extent permitted by applicable Law, each of
the parties hereto hereby consents to the service of process in accordance
with _Section_ __ _ 8.7_; _provided_ , that nothing herein shall affect the
right of any party to serve legal process in any other manner permitted by
Law.

 

Section 8.5 _Remedies_. The parties hereto agree and acknowledge that if
any of the provisions of this Agreement were not performed in accordance with
their specific terms or were otherwise breached, irreparable damage would
occur, no adequate remedy at law would exist and damages would be difficult to
determine, and accordingly, prior to any valid termination of this Agreement
in accordance with _Section_ __ _ 7.1_, (a) each of the parties hereto shall
be entitled to, and may seek in the alternative, such remedies as are
available at law and in equity, and (b) (i) the parties shall be entitled to
an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to
specific performance of the terms hereof, in each case in the Chosen Court (in
the order expressed in  _Section_ __ _ 8.4(b)_), this being in addition to
any other remedy to which they are entitled at law or in equity, (ii) the
parties waive any requirement for the securing or posting of any bond in
connection with the obtaining of any specific performance or injunctive
relief and (iii) the parties will waive, in any action for specific
performance, the defense of adequacy of a remedy at law. In circumstances
where Parent and Merger Sub are obligated to consummate the Merger and the
Merger has not been consummated, Parent and Merger Sub expressly acknowledge
and agree that the Company and its stockholders shall have suffered
irreparable harm, that monetary damages will be inadequate to compensate the
Company and its stockholders, and that the Company on behalf of itself and its
stockholders shall be entitled (in addition to any other remedy that may be
available to it whether in law or equity, including monetary damages) to
enforce specifically Parents and Merger Subs obligations to consummate the
Merger. Any partys pursuit of specific performance at any time will not be
deemed an election of remedies or waiver of the right to pursue any other
right or remedy to which such party may be entitled, including the right to
pursue remedies for Liabilities or damages incurred or suffered by such party
or its stockholders. In no event shall the Company be entitled to receive (1)
both a grant of specific performance or other equitable relief, on the one
hand, and the payment of all or any portion of the Parent Termination Fee, on
the other hand or (2) both payment of any monetary damages whatsoever, on the
one hand, and payment of all or any portion of the Parent Termination Fee, on
the other hand. For the avoidance of doubt, subject in all respects to
_Section_ __ _ 7.2_, _Section_ __ _ 7.3_ and _Section_ __ _ 8.15_
(including, in each case, the limitations set forth therein), the parties
hereto shall be entitled to seek the remedies provided herein in the
alternative, and not be required to elect their remedies, in any Proceeding
brought to seek redress for the failure of Parent to consummate the Merger
pursuant to this Agreement.

 

Section 8.6 _WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL_. EACH OF THE PARTIES HERETO
IRREVOCABLY WAIVES ANY AND ALL RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY LEGAL PROCEEDING
ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED
HEREBY.

Agreement without the prior written consent of the Company to any of its

Section 8.9 _Severability_. Any term or provision of this Agreement that

of such invalidity or unenforceability without rendering invalid or
unenforceable the remaining terms and provisions of this Agreement in any
other jurisdiction, so long as the economic or legal substance of the
transactions contemplated hereby is not affected in any manner materially
adverse to any party hereto; provided, that the economic and legal substance
of the transactions contemplated hereby shall be deemed to be affected in a
manner materially adverse to the parties hereto if _Section_ __ _ 7.3_ or 
_Section_ __ _ 8.15_ is invalid, void or incapable of being enforced. Upon
such a determination that any term or other provision is invalid, void, or
incapable of being enforced, the parties hereto shall negotiate in good faith

hereto as closely as possible in a reasonably acceptable manner so that the
transactions contemplated hereby may be consummated as originally contemplated
to the fullest extent possible.

amendment, by the Company, Parent and Merger Sub;  _provided_ , that after
the occurrence of the Company Stockholder Approval, if any such amendment or
waiver shall by applicable Law or in accordance with the rules and regulations
of Nasdaq require further approval of the stockholders of the Company, the
effectiveness of such amendment or waiver shall be subject to the approval of
the stockholders of the Company. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no failure or
delay by any party hereto in exercising any right hereunder shall operate as
a waiver thereof, nor shall any single or partial exercise thereof preclude
any other or further exercise of any other right hereunder.

 Section 8.12 _Headings_. Headings of the Articles and Sections of this
Agreement are for convenience of the parties only and shall be given no
substantive or interpretive effect whatsoever. The table of contents to this
