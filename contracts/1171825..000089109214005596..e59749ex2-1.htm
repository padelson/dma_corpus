NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the mutual covenants, representations,
warranties and agreements contained herein, and intending to be legally bound
hereby, the parties agree as follows:

  

Article I

  

 THE MERGER

  

 __1.1   _The Merger_.

  

(a)  Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, in
accordance with the Delaware Limited Liability Company Act (the " _DLLCA_ "),
at the Effective Time, Oxygen shall merge with and into Merger Sub. Merger Sub
shall be the Surviving Company in the Merger, and shall continue its limited
liability company existence under the Laws of the State of Delaware.
Upon consummation of the Merger, the separate limited liability company
existence of Oxygen shall terminate.

  

(b)  Subject to the consent of Oxygen, authorized by its Board
of Directors, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed,
Carbon may at any time change the method of effecting the combination of
Oxygen and Carbon if and to the extent that Carbon deems such change to be
desirable; _provided_ that no such change shall (i) alter or change the
amount, kind or allocation of the Net Merger Consideration provided for in
this Agreement, (ii) adversely affect the Tax treatment of the holders of
Oxygen Common Interests, Oxygen Converted Common Interests, Oxygen Profits
Interests or Oxygen Options (each an " _Oxygen Holder_ " and collectively,
the " _Oxygen Holders_ ") as a result of receiving their portion of the Net
Merger Consideration or the Tax treatment of either party pursuant to this
Agreement, (iii) materially impede or delay the receipt of any consents
or approvals of or complete any filings or registrations with any
Governmental Entity in connection with the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement (including the receipt of FDIC Consents, FDIC Non-Objections, GSE
Consents and GSE Non-Objections) or (iv) materially impede or delay
consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

  

 __1.2   _Effective Time_. The Merger shall become effective as
set forth in the certificate of merger to be filed with the Secretary of
State of the State of Delaware on the Closing Date (the " _Certificate of
Merger_ "). The term " _Effective Time_ " shall be the date and time when the
Merger becomes effective, as set forth in the Certificate of Merger.

  

 __1.3   _Effects of the Merger_. At and after the Effective
Time, the Merger shall have the effects set forth in the applicable
provisions of the DLLCA.

  

 __1.4   _Conversion of Interests_. At the Effective Time, by
virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of Carbon, Oxygen,
Merger Sub or the holder of any of the following securities: 

  

(a)  Subject to Section 2.2(f), each Oxygen Common Interest
that is issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (other
than Cancelled Interests or any Oxygen Interest Award) shall be converted into
the right to receive (i) a number of shares of Carbon Common Stock equal to
the Per Interest Stock Consideration and (ii) an amount of cash equal to the
Per Interest Cash Consideration, in each case as determined pursuant to
Section 1.7 (the consideration referred to in clauses (i) and (ii)
being collectively referred to as the " _Per Common Interest Merger
Consideration_ "; _provided_ that each Oxygen Common Interest (other

    

\- 6 - 
--- 

 


--- 

 

_STRICTLY CONFIDENTIAL_ 
EXECUTION

  

than any Oxygen Interest Award) that is owned by a Non-Accredited Investor
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall instead be converted into the
right to receive an amount of cash, without interest, equal to the Merger
Consideration Per Fully Diluted Interest (the " _Non-Accredited Investor
Common Interest Consideration_ ") and the right to receive a contingent
payment from the Holdback Amount and the Holder Expense Fund pursuant to and
subject to the terms and conditions of Section 6.17 and Section 6.18,
respectively.

  

(b)  At the Effective Time, each award of Oxygen Common
Interests that is issued and outstanding but unvested as of immediately prior
to the Effective Time (an " _Oxygen Interest Award_ "), subject to receipt of
a duly executed Holder Acknowledgement and Investor Questionnaire, shall be
converted into an award (a " _Carbon Stock Award_ ") with respect to a
number of unvested restricted shares of Carbon Common Stock (rounded to the
nearest whole share) that is equal to the product of (i) the number of Oxygen
Common Interests subject to such Oxygen Interest Award, multiplied by (ii) the
quotient of (A) the Merger Consideration Per Fully Diluted Interest, _divided
by_ (B) the Carbon Signing Price; _provided_ that each Oxygen Interest Award
that is held by a Non-Accredited Investor and is issued and outstanding but
unvested as of immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be converted
into an award (a " _Carbon Cash Award_ ") with respect to an amount of
cash, without interest, equal to the Merger Consideration Per Fully Diluted
Interest. The vesting schedule and all other material terms of each Carbon
Stock Award and Carbon Cash Award shall otherwise remain substantially the
same as those that were applicable to the corresponding Oxygen Interest Award
(to the extent relevant following the Effective Time) and shall have such
other terms applicable to awards in respect of Carbon Common Stock as are
consistent with the terms of the Carbon Long-Term Incentive Plan, as in
effect from time to time.

  

(c)  At the Effective Time, all Oxygen Common Interests that
are owned, directly or indirectly, by Oxygen or any of its wholly owned
Subsidiaries (the " _Cancelled Interests_ ") shall be cancelled and shall
cease to exist and no Carbon Common Stock or other consideration shall be
delivered in exchange therefor.

  

(d)  All of the Oxygen Common Interests converted into the right
to receive the Per Common Interest Merger Consideration or the Non-Accredited
Investor Common Interest Consideration pursuant to this Article I shall no
longer be outstanding and shall automatically be cancelled and shall cease to
exist as of the Effective Time, and shall thereafter represent only the right
to receive (x) the Per Common Interest Merger Consideration and cash in lieu
of fractional shares or the Non-Accredited Investor Common Interest
Consideration, as applicable, which the Oxygen Common Interests have been
converted into the right to receive pursuant to this Section 1.4 and Section
2.2(f), without any interest thereon, and (y) a contingent payment from the
Holdback Amount and the Holder Expense Fund pursuant to and subject to the
terms and conditions of Section 6.17 and Section 6.18, respectively. All of
the awards of Oxygen Common Interests converted into Carbon Stock Awards or
Carbon Cash Awards, as applicable, pursuant to this Article I shall no
longer be outstanding and shall automatically be cancelled and shall cease to
exist as of the Effective Time, and shall thereafter represent only the right
to receive a Carbon Stock Award or Carbon Cash Award, as applicable, and the
right to receive a contingent payment from the Holdback Amount and the Holder
Expense Fund pursuant to and subject to the terms and conditions of Section
6.17 and Section 6.18, respectively; _provided_ that any such amounts that
are attributable to Oxygen Interest Awards shall only be

    

\- 7 -

--- 

 

_STRICTLY CONFIDENTIAL_ 
EXECUTION

  

paid when (and if) the corresponding Carbon Stock Award vests, and shall be
forfeited if the corresponding Carbon Stock Award is forfeited. In the event
any amounts attributable to Oxygen Interests Awards are forfeited, such
amounts shall be distributed reasonably promptly thereafter to the former
holders of vested Oxygen Common Interests, Oxygen Interest Awards and In-the-
Money Oxygen Options, based upon such holder's then-applicable Holdback
Percentage.

  

(e)  Each limited liability company interest of Merger Sub
issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be
converted into and become one limited liability company interest of the
Surviving Company.

  

(f)  At or prior to the Effective Time, Oxygen, the Board of
Directors of Oxygen and its compensation committee, as applicable, shall
adopt any resolutions and take any actions that are reasonably necessary to
effectuate the provisions of Section 1.4(b) and to ensure that,
notwithstanding anything to the contrary, following the Effective Time, no
service provider of Oxygen and its Subsidiaries shall have any right to
acquire any securities of Oxygen, Carbon or any Subsidiary thereof or to
receive any payment, right or benefit with respect to any award previously
granted in respect of securities of Oxygen, except the right to receive the
consideration as provided in Sections 1.4(b) or Section 1.6 in their capacity
as Oxygen Holders.

  

(g)  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in
Section 1.6 of the Merger Agreement or any other provision of the Merger
Agreement, nothing in this Merger Agreement is intended to, or shall,
terminate or otherwise affect the rights of any holder of options to purchase
Common Interests listed on Section 3.2(a)(i) of the Oxygen Disclosure
Schedules to receive (i) any Dividend Equivalent Payments as set forth on
Section 3.11(a) of the Oxygen Disclosure Schedules or (ii) any payments or
benefits under Section 5.07 of the Oxygen LLC Agreement, in each case, with
respect to such holder's options to purchase Common Interests listed on
Section 3.2(a)(i) of the Oxygen Disclosure Schedules, _provided_ that, for the
avoidance of doubt, in no event will there be any payments or benefits due
under Section 5.07 of the Oxygen LLC Agreement in respect of the contingent
payment from the Holdback Amount or the Holder Expense Fund.

  

 __1.5   _Carbon Common Stock_. At and after the Effective Time,
each share of Carbon Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to
the Effective Time shall remain an issued and outstanding share of Carbon
Common Stock and shall not be affected by the Merger.

  

 __1.6   _Oxygen Options_.

  

(a)  At the Effective Time, each Oxygen Option other than an
Out-of-the-Money Oxygen Option, whether or not vested, shall be cancelled and
shall entitle the holder thereof to the right to receive, (i) a number of
shares of Carbon Common Stock equal to the Per Option Stock Consideration and
(ii) an amount of cash equal to the Per Option Cash Consideration, in each
case as determined pursuant to Section 1.7 (the consideration referred to in
clause (i) and (ii) being collectively referred to as the " _Per Option
Merger Consideration_ "); _provided_ that in lieu of receiving the Per Option
Merger Consideration, any holder of an Oxygen Option who is a Non-Accredited
Investor shall instead receive an amount of cash, without

    

\- 8 - 
--- 

 


--- 

 

_STRICTLY CONFIDENTIAL_ 
EXECUTION

  

interest, equal to the Option Consideration in respect of each such Oxygen
Option (the " _Non-Accredited Investor Option Consideration_ "); _provided_ ,
_further_  that if a holder of an Oxygen Option who is not a Non-Accredited
Investor (an " _Option Holder_ ") timely makes a Gross Settlement Election in
respect of some or all of such Option Holder's Oxygen Options (such Oxygen
Options as are covered by the Gross Settlement Election, the " _Electing
Options_ "), then such Option Holder shall, immediately prior to the
Effective Time, pay to Oxygen the full exercise price required to be paid to
exercise such Electing Options and at the Effective Time, such Option Holder
shall not be entitled to receive the Per Option Merger Consideration in
respect of such Electing Options but shall instead be entitled to receive, in
respect of such Electing Options, (i) a number of shares of Carbon Common
Stock equal to the product of (A) the Per Interest Stock Consideration
multiplied by (B) the number of Common Interests issuable upon exercise in
full of such Electing Options, and (ii) an amount of cash equal to the product
of (A) the Per Interest Cash Consideration multiplied by (B) the number of
Common Interests issuable upon exercise in full of such Electing Options,
in each case as determined pursuant to Section 1.7. At the Effective Time,
each Oxygen Option with an exercise price equal to or greater than the Merger
Consideration Per Fully Diluted Interest (each, an " _Out-of-the-Money Oxygen
Option_ "), whether or not vested, shall be cancelled for no consideration.

  

(b)  At least twenty (20) Business Days prior to the Effective
Time, Oxygen shall provide each Option Holder with notice of the proposed
Closing of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the opportunity
for such Option Holder to elect, in writing as of no later than ten (10)
Business Days prior to the Effective Time, to pay to Oxygen in cash in
immediately available funds the full exercise price in respect of some or all
of such Option Holder's Oxygen Option, which amount shall be paid in
immediately available funds, and evidence of payment of which shall be
provided to Carbon, no later than three (3) Business Days prior to
the Effective Time (such election, a " _Gross Settlement Election_ "). To
extent such funds are not timely paid in accordance with the foregoing, the
Gross Settlement Election shall be null and void.

  

(c)  Immediately prior to the Effective Time, Oxygen, the Board
of Directors of Oxygen and its compensation committee, as applicable, shall
adopt any resolutions and take any actions that are reasonably necessary to
effectuate the provisions of this Section 1.6 (including without limitation
amending the terms of any outstanding Oxygen Options) and to ensure that,
notwithstanding anything to the contrary, following the Effective Time, no
service provider of Oxygen and its Subsidiaries shall have any right to
acquire any securities of Oxygen, Carbon or any Subsidiary thereof or to
receive any payment, right or benefit with respect to any award previously
granted in respect of securities of Oxygen except the right to receive the
consideration as provided in this Section 1.6 or in Section 1.4(a) or 1.4(b)
in their capacity as Oxygen Holders.

  

 __1.7   _Allocation of Merger Consideration_.

  

(a)  The Net Merger Consideration shall be allocated among the
holders of the Oxygen Common Interests and Oxygen Options as set forth in
Section 1.4, Section 1.6 and Section 1.7(b). An illustrative calculation of
the allocation is set forth on _Annex B_.

Business Day period, Carbon and Oxygen have not been able to resolve in
writing all differences that they have with respect to the matters raised in
the Notice of Disagreement, Carbon and Oxygen shall submit to Deloitte and
Touche (the " _Accounting Firm_ ") for review and resolution of any and all
matters in the Notice of Disagreement that remain in dispute, and the
Accounting Firm shall reach a final, binding resolution of all such matters

signed by the Accounting Firm, (ii) within the range of the amounts contested
by Carbon and Oxygen, (iii) furnished to Carbon and Oxygen as soon as
practicable after the items in dispute have been referred to the Accounting
Firm, which shall not be more than thirty (30) Business Days after such
referral, (iv) made in accordance with the terms of this Agreement and (v)

written resolution (other than in the case of fraud). Carbon and Oxygen agree
to cooperate with the Accounting Firm and to promptly provide all documents
and information reasonably requested by the Accounting Firm so as to
enable it to make its determination as quickly and as accurately as possible.
The fees and expenses of the Accounting Firm shall be borne by Oxygen and
Carbon in the same proportion that Oxygen's position, on the one hand, and
Carbon's position, on the other hand, initially presented to the Accounting
Firm (based on the aggregate of all differences taken as a whole) bear to
the final resolution as determined by the Accounting Firm; _provided_ that
any fees and expenses borne by Oxygen shall be Transaction Expenses. Carbon
shall only be entitled to dispute (i) the calculation of the Gross Merger
Consideration (including the calculation of Tangible Common Equity, Tangible
Assets, Required Capital, Excess Capital and the Excluded Amount) and (ii)
with respect to amounts set forth on the Oxygen Audited Interim Financial
Statements, (a) mathematical errors, (b) errors discovered by
Oxygen (including if such error would be addressed by including an adjustment
in its financial statements for a subsequent period) and (c) that the Oxygen
Audited Interim Financial Statements (including the related notes, where
applicable), (1) were not prepared from, and are not in accordance with, the
books and records of Oxygen and its Subsidiaries, (2) were not prepared in
accordance with GAAP consistently applied during the periods involved and (3)
were not prepared on a basis consistent with the audited consolidated balance
sheet and related audited consolidated statements of income included in the
Oxygen Audited Financial Statements as of, and for the period ended December
31, 2013. Notwithstanding the foregoing, changes in underlying assumptions or
models (including with respect to valuation of assets) shall not be a basis
for dispute under the foregoing clause (3) so long as such changes were not
inconsistent with the standards set forth in clauses (iii) and (iv) of Section
3.8(b).

  

(iv)  Gross Merger Consideration as finally determined pursuant to
Section 1.7(c)(iii) shall be the " _Final Gross Merger Consideration_."

obligations of Carbon or Oxygen set forth herein with respect to the Bank
Merger or any of the conditions set forth in Section 7.1, 7.2 or 7.3 relating
to the Bank Merger, if the parties agree that operational issues relating to

following the Effective Time (1) a Certificate representing that number of
whole shares of Carbon Common Stock to which such holder of vested Oxygen
Common Interests shall have become entitled pursuant to the provisions of
Article I, if any, and (2) an amount of cash, including any cash in lieu of
fractional shares which such holder has the right to receive pursuant to the
provisions of Article I and this Article II and (B) the holder of such In-
the-Money Oxygen Option shall be entitled to receive, promptly following the
Effective Time (1) a Certificate representing that number of whole shares of
Carbon Common Stock to which such holder of such In-the-Money Oxygen Option

and (2) an amount of cash, including any cash in lieu of fractional shares
which such holder has the right to receive in respect of such In-the-Money
Oxygen Option pursuant to the provisions of Article I and this Article II, if
any; _provided_ that any cash due to a holder of Oxygen Common Interests or
In-the-Money Oxygen Options shall be paid (x) if such amount is greater than
or equal to $100,000, at the holder's election, by check or wire transfer and
(y) if such amount is less than $100,000, by check; _provided further_ that
Carbon may deliver the cash portion of any consideration payable to a holder
of an In-the-Money Oxygen Option through its ordinary payroll systems in lieu
of delivery of a check or wire transfer. No interest will be paid or accrued
on any cash to be paid to holders of Oxygen Common Interests or Oxygen
Options, or cash in lieu of fractional shares.

  

(c)  No dividends or other distributions declared with respect
to Carbon Common Stock shall be paid to any holder who has not delivered in
accordance with this Article II a properly completed, duly executed Letter of
Transmittal and a properly completed, duly executed Investor Questionnaire,
or in the case of the holder of an In-the-Money Oxygen Option, a properly

recorded, it shall be a condition of the issuance thereof that the Letter of
Transmittal delivered with respect to such Oxygen Common Interests shall be
accompanied by an appropriate instrument of transfer, and that the Person
requesting such exchange shall pay to the Exchange Agent in advance any
transfer or other similar Taxes required by reason of the issuance of a
Certificate representing shares of Carbon Common Stock

in any name other than that of the record holder of the Oxygen Common
Interests surrendered, or required for any other reason, or shall establish to
the satisfaction of the Exchange Agent that such Tax has been paid or is not
payable.

  

(e)  After the Effective Time, there shall be no transfers on
the books of Oxygen of Oxygen Common Interests that were issued and
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time.

  

(f)  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein,
no Certificates representing fractional shares of Carbon Common Stock shall
be issued in exchange for Oxygen Common Interests or in exchange for Oxygen
Options, no dividend or distribution with respect to Carbon Common Stock
shall be payable on or with respect to any fractional share, and such
fractional share interests shall not entitle the owner thereof to vote or to
any other rights of a shareholder of Carbon. In lieu of the issuance of any
such fractional share, Carbon shall pay to each former holder of vested
Oxygen Common Interests or In-the-Money Oxygen Options who otherwise would be
entitled to receive such fractional share an amount in cash (rounded to the
nearest cent) determined by multiplying (i) the Carbon Closing Price by (ii)
the fraction of a share (rounded to the nearest thousandth when expressed in
decimal form) of Carbon Common Stock which such holder would otherwise be
entitled to receive pursuant to Section 1.4.

  

(g)  Any portion of the Exchange Fund that remains unclaimed by
the former holders of vested Oxygen Common Interest and In-the-Money Oxygen
Options for twelve (12) months after the Effective Time shall be paid to
Carbon; _provided_ that if at any time prior to such date, any portion of the
Exchange Fund that remains unclaimed would have to be delivered to a public
official pursuant to applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar Laws,
the Exchange Agent shall first notify Carbon and, at Carbon's option, such
portion shall instead be paid to Carbon. Any former holder of vested Oxygen
Common Interests or In-the-Money Oxygen Options who has not theretofore
complied with this Article II shall thereafter look only to Carbon for payment
of the Per Common Interest Merger Consideration, Per Option Merger
Consideration, Non-Accredited Investor Common Interest Consideration, or Non-
Accredited Investor Option Consideration, as applicable, and any unpaid
dividends and distributions on the Carbon Common Stock deliverable in respect
of each former Oxygen Common Interest or Oxygen Option such holder holds as
determined pursuant to this Agreement, in each case, without any interest
thereon. Notwithstanding the foregoing, none of Carbon, Oxygen, the Exchange
Agent or any other Person shall be liable to any former holder of Oxygen
Common Interests or Oxygen Options for any amount delivered in good faith to
a public official pursuant to applicable abandoned property, escheat or
similar Laws.

  

(h)  Carbon shall be entitled to deduct and withhold, or cause
the Exchange Agent to deduct and withhold, from the consideration otherwise
payable pursuant to this Agreement to any holder of vested Oxygen Common
Interests or In-the-Money Oxygen Options such amounts as it is required to
deduct and withhold with respect to the making of such payment under the Code
or any provision of state, local or foreign Tax Law. To the extent that
amounts are so withheld by Carbon or the Exchange Agent, as the case may
be, and paid over to the appropriate Governmental Entity, the withheld
amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been
paid to the holder of Oxygen Common Interests or Oxygen Options in respect of
which the deduction and withholding was made by Carbon or the Exchange

Agent, as the case may be. For purposes of this provision, all Taxes required
to be withheld or deducted under the Code or any provision of state, local or
foreign Tax Law in respect of a holder's In-the-Money Oxygen Options
(including the Electing Options) (the " _Option Withholding Amount_ ") shall
first be reduced from the aggregate Per Option Cash Consideration payable in
respect of such In-the-Money Oxygen Options (the " _Option Cash Amount_ ")
(or the Per Interest Cash Consideration in respect of an Electing Option if
the holder of such Electing Option does not separately pay the Withholding
Amount in cash). If the Option Withholding Amount exceeds the Option Cash
Amount or Per Interest Cash Consideration, as applicable, the amount of the
shortfall shall then reduce the Per Option Stock Consideration or Per
Interest Stock Consideration, as applicable, to be received in respect of such
Oxygen Options, with the value of such Per Option Stock Consideration or Per
Interest Stock Consideration, as applicable, based on the closing-sale price
of Carbon Common Stock on the NYSE as reported by The Wall Street Journal on
the Closing Date.

  

(i)  All shares of Carbon Common Stock received in the Merger
shall bear a legend or legends (and appropriate comparable notations or other
arrangements will be made with respect to any uncertificated shares)
referencing restrictions on transfer of such shares of Carbon Common Stock
under the Securities Act which legend shall state in substance:

  

"The securities evidenced by this certificate have been issued and sold
without registration under the United States Securities Act of 1933, as
amended (the " _Securities Act_ "), or the securities laws of any state of the
United States (a " _State Act_ ") in reliance upon certain exemptions from
registration under said acts. The securities evidenced by this
certificate cannot be sold, assigned or otherwise transferred within the
United States unless such sale, assignment or other transfer is (i) made
pursuant to an effective registration statement under the Securities Act and
in accordance with each applicable State Act or (ii) exempt from, or not
subject to, the Securities Act and each applicable State Act."

  

(j)  Notwithstanding Section 2.2(i), the holder of any
Certificate(s) for such shares of Carbon Common Stock shall be entitled to
receive from Carbon new Certificates for a like number of shares not bearing
such legend (or the elimination or termination of such notations or
arrangements) upon the request of such holder at (i) such time as such
restrictions are no longer applicable, and (ii) if required by Carbon,
delivery of an opinion of counsel to such holder, which opinion is reasonably
satisfactory in form and substance to Carbon, that the restriction referenced
in such legend (or such notations or arrangements) is no longer required in
order to ensure compliance with the Securities Act.

  

 __2.3   _Holder Expense Fund_. On the Closing Date, Carbon
shall pay to the Holders' Representative or to such other persons (and in
such amounts) as may be designated by the Holders' Representative, by wire
transfer to an account or accounts designated by the Holders' Representative
in writing prior to the Closing Date, immediately available funds in the
amount of the Holder Expense Fund.

Article III

  

 REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF OXYGEN

  

Except as Previously Disclosed by Oxygen, Oxygen hereby represents and
warrants to Carbon and Merger Sub as follows:

  

 __3.1   _Corporate Organization_.

  

(a)  Oxygen is a limited liability company duly organized,
validly existing and in good standing under the Laws of the State of
Delaware, and is a bank holding company duly registered under the BHC Act.
Oxygen has the corporate power and authority to own or lease all of its
properties and assets and to carry on its business as it is now being
conducted. Oxygen is duly licensed or qualified to do business in each
jurisdiction in which the nature of the business conducted by it or the
character or location of the properties and assets owned or leased by it
makes such licensing or qualification necessary, except where the failure
to be so licensed or qualified would not, either individually or in the
aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on
Oxygen. True and complete copies of the Organizational Documents of Oxygen, as
amended through the date hereof have previously been Made Available by Oxygen
to Carbon. The Oxygen Organizational Documents are in full force and effect
and Oxygen is not in violation of any of their provisions.

  

(b)  Each Oxygen Subsidiary (i) is duly organized and validly
existing under the Laws of its jurisdiction of organization, (ii) is duly
qualified to do business and, where such concept is recognized under
applicable Law, in good standing in all jurisdictions (whether federal,
state, local or foreign) where its ownership or leasing of property or the
conduct of its business requires it to be so qualified and in which the
failure to be so qualified would reasonably be expected to have a Material
Adverse Effect on Oxygen and (iii) has all requisite corporate power and
authority to own or lease its properties and assets and to carry on
its business as now conducted. There are no restrictions on the ability of
any Oxygen Subsidiary to pay dividends or distributions except, in the case
of a Subsidiary that is a regulated entity, for restrictions on dividends or
distributions generally applicable to all such regulated entities. The
deposit accounts of each Subsidiary of Oxygen that is an insured depository
institution are insured by the FDIC through the Deposit Insurance Fund to the
fullest extent permitted by applicable Law, all premiums and
assessments required to be paid in connection therewith have been paid when
due, and no proceedings for the termination of such insurance are pending or
threatened. Section 3.1(b) of the Oxygen Disclosure Schedule sets forth a true
and complete list of all Subsidiaries of Oxygen and any joint ventures,
partnerships or similar arrangements in which Oxygen or its Subsidiaries has a
limited liability, partnership or other equity interest (and the amount and
percentage of any such interest). True and complete copies of the
Organizational Documents of each Oxygen Subsidiary, as amended through the
date hereof, have previously been Made Available by Oxygen to Carbon. All
such Organizational Documents are in full force and effect and Oxygen and its
Subsidiaries are not in violation of any of their provisions.

 __3.2   _Capitalization_.

  

(a)  As of the date of this Agreement, the authorized limited
liability company interests of Oxygen consist of Oxygen Common Interests,
Oxygen Converted Common Interests and Oxygen Profits Interests. As of
immediately prior to the Effective Time and subject to the adoption of the
amendment to the Oxygen LLC Agreement as contemplated by Section 6.5 (the "
_Amended Oxygen LLC Agreement_ "), the authorized limited liability company
interests of Oxygen issued and outstanding will only consist of Oxygen Common
Interests. As of the date of this Agreement, Oxygen has no limited liability
company interests issued and outstanding, other than 16,160,812.78 Oxygen
Common Interests issued and outstanding, 492,532.01 Oxygen Converted Common
Interests and 4.7286% Oxygen Profits Interests. As of the date hereof, there
are outstanding 325,405.68 options to purchase Common Interests, which if

any such payment and (y) the aggregate present value of the benefits foregone
by, and additional Liabilities to, Carbon, Oxygen and their Subsidiaries as a
result of, arising out of, or relating to any such FDIC Modifications as

benefits received by Oxygen, or of any Liabilities with respect to which
Oxygen is released, as a result of, arising out of, or relating to any such
FDIC Modifications as compared to the terms of the FDIC Agreements had they
remained in effect without such FDIC Modifications ((x) and (y), net of (z),
a " _FDIC Payment_ ") is, in the aggregate, a reasonable amount.

aggregate present value of the benefits foregone by, and
additional Liabilities to, Carbon, Oxygen and their Subsidiaries as a result
of, arising out of, or relating to any such GSE Modifications as compared to
the terms of the GSE Agreements had they remained in effect without such GSE
Modifications net of (z) the aggregate present value of any benefits received
by Oxygen, or of any Liabilities with respect to which Oxygen is released, as
a result of, arising out of, or relating to any such GSE Modifications as

not) (A) take any action, or commit to take any action, or agree to any
condition or restriction, in connection with obtaining the foregoing permits,

contemplated hereby or (B) make or incur or commit to make or incur any FDIC
Payment that is, in the aggregate, not a reasonable amount in the context of

Agreement or (ii) Oxygen or its Subsidiaries to (and without the prior

this Agreement or GSE Payment in an amount that is, in the aggregate, not a
reasonable amount in the context of Section 6.1(c) of this Agreement ((i) or
(ii) a " _Burdensome Condition_ "). Fifty percent (50%) of any FDIC Payment or
GSE Payment that Oxygen, Carbon or their respective Subsidiaries make, incur
or commit to make or incur that does not constitute a Burdensome
Condition shall be fully reflected as a Transaction Expense in the
calculation of the Net Merger Consideration in an amount reasonably
satisfactory to Carbon and Oxygen (or finally determined pursuant Section
9.14).

  

 __6.2   _Access to Information_.

  

(a)  Upon reasonable notice and subject to applicable Laws,
each party shall, and shall cause each of its Subsidiaries to, afford to the
officers, employees, accountants, counsel, advisors and other representatives
of the other party, access, during normal business hours during the period
prior to the Effective Time, to its properties, books, employees, Contracts,
commitments and records, and, during such period, shall, and shall cause its
Subsidiaries to, make available to the other party (i) a copy of each

by it during such period pursuant to the requirements of federal securities
Laws or federal or state banking Laws (other than reports or documents which
Oxygen is not permitted to disclose under applicable Law), and (ii) all other
information concerning its business, properties and personnel as may
reasonably be requested. Neither party, nor any of its Subsidiaries, shall be
required to provide access to or to disclose information where such access or
disclosure jeopardize the attorney-client privilege of the institution in
possession or control of such information or violates any applicable Law or
Contract; _provided_ that such party will use reasonable best efforts to make
appropriate substitute disclosure arrangements under circumstances in which
the restrictions of the preceding sentence apply.

  

(b)  Each party shall hold all information furnished by or on
behalf of the other party or any of its Subsidiaries or

and its Subsidiaries (the " _Financing_ ") (it being understood that the
receipt of such Financing is not a condition to the Merger) or (ii) any
repurchase of Carbon Common Stock by Carbon (a " _Stock Repurchase_ "); 
_provided_ that nothing herein shall require such cooperation to the extent it
would (A) unreasonably disrupt the conduct of the business or operations of
Oxygen or its Subsidiaries, (B) require Oxygen or any of its Subsidiaries to
agree to pay any fees, reimburse any expenses or otherwise incur any
liability or give any indemnities prior to the Closing for which it is
not promptly reimbursed or simultaneously indemnified or (C) require Oxygen
or any of its Subsidiaries to take any action that would reasonably be
expected to result in any violation of, or default under its Organization
Documents, any applicable Laws or any Contract.

  

(d)  Such cooperation required by Section 6.2(c) shall include,
without limitation, as promptly as reasonably practical following a request
from Carbon for such information, furnishing Carbon and any of its financing
sources, if applicable, with (i) the Oxygen Financial Statements (and once
available pursuant to Section 1.7(c), the Oxygen Audited Interim Financial
Statements), (ii) unaudited consolidated balance sheets and related

information and data regarding Oxygen and its Subsidiaries as Carbon may
reasonably request in connection with such Financing or Stock Repurchase, in

with the SEC in connection with such Financing or Stock Repurchase. Carbon
shall promptly, upon request by Oxygen, reimburse Oxygen for all reasonable
costs and expenses (including reasonable attorneys' fees, but excluding for
the avoidance of doubt, the costs of Oxygen's preparation of its annual and
quarterly financial statements) incurred by Oxygen or any of its
Subsidiaries or their respective Representatives in connection with the
Financing or a Stock Repurchase, including the cooperation of Oxygen and its
Subsidiaries and Representatives contemplated by this Section 6.2(d), and
shall indemnify and hold harmless Oxygen, its Subsidiaries and their
respective Representatives from and against any and all losses, damages,

expressly provided by Oxygen or its Subsidiaries in writing for use in
connection with the Financing or a Stock Repurchase or (b) any fraud or
intentional misrepresentation or willful misconduct by any such persons.

respective representatives shall affect or be deemed to modify or waive the
representations and warranties of the other set forth herein.

  

 __6.3   _Employee Benefit Plans_.

individual who is an employee of Oxygen and its Subsidiaries at the Effective

_STRICTLY CONFIDENTIAL_ 
EXECUTION

  

Carbon or its Subsidiaries, with compensation opportunities and employee
benefits that are substantially comparable in the aggregate (excluding any
benefits accelerated or payable as a result of the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement) to the compensation opportunities and employee benefits
provided to similarly situated employees of Carbon and its Subsidiaries;
_provided_ , that for purposes of the foregoing sentence the
compensation opportunities and employee benefit plans generally provided to
employees of Oxygen as of immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be
deemed to be substantially comparable, on an aggregate basis, to those
provided to similarly situated employees of Carbon and its Subsidiaries for
purposes of this sentence, it being understood that the Continuing Employees
may commence participation in Carbon's benefit plans on different dates
following the Effective Time with respect to different benefit plans. Any
Continuing Employee whose employment is terminated within the one-year period
following the Effective Time under circumstances that would entitle such
Continuing Employee to severance benefits under the severance plan of Carbon
and its Subsidiaries that is applicable to similarly situated employees of
Carbon and its Subsidiaries, shall be entitled to severance benefits under
such severance plan. Nothing contained in this Section 6.3(a) shall be deemed
to grant any Continuing Employee any right to continued employment after the
Closing Date.

  

(b)  With respect to any employee benefit plans of Carbon or its
Subsidiaries providing benefits to any Continuing Employee after the
Effective Time (a " _New Benefit Plan_ "), Carbon shall: (i) waive all pre-
existing conditions, exclusions and waiting periods with respect to
participation and coverage requirements applicable to such employees and
their eligible dependents under any New Benefit Plans that provide health care
benefits in which such employees first become eligible to participate after
the Effective Time, except to the extent such pre-existing conditions,
exclusions or waiting periods would apply under the analogous Oxygen Benefit
Plan; (ii) to the extent allowed by the provider of any New Benefit Plan that
provides health care benefits, provide each such employee and their eligible
dependents with credit for any co-payments and deductibles paid prior to the
Effective Time under an Oxygen Benefit Plan that provided health care benefits
(to the same extent that such credit was given under the analogous Oxygen
Benefit Plan prior to the Effective Time) in satisfying any applicable
deductible or out-of-pocket requirements under any such New Benefit Plans in
the plan year in which such employees first become eligible to
participate after the Effective Time; and (iii) recognize all service of such
Continuing Employees with Oxygen and its Subsidiaries as well as actual
service by such Continuing Employees with any predecessors to Oxygen and its
Subsidiaries, including any entities the stock or assets of were acquired by
Oxygen and its Subsidiaries, for all purposes in any New Benefit Plan in which
such employees first become eligible to participate after the Effective Time
to the same extent that such service was taken into account under the
analogous Oxygen Benefit Plan prior to the Effective Time and for purposes of
any severance plan of Carbon or its Subsidiaries in which such Continuing
Employee participates; _provided_ that the foregoing service recognition shall
not apply (A) to the extent it would result in duplication of benefits for
the same period of services, (B) for purposes of any defined benefit
retirement plan or benefit plan that provides retiree welfare benefits or (C)
to any benefit plan that is a frozen plan or provides grandfathered benefits.

  

(c)  If requested by Carbon in writing delivered to Oxygen not
less than ten (10) Business Days before the Closing Date, the Board of
Directors of Oxygen (or the appropriate committee thereof) shall adopt
resolutions and take such corporate action as is

    

\- 56 -

_STRICTLY CONFIDENTIAL_ 
EXECUTION

  

necessary to terminate Oxygen's 401(k) plans (collectively, the " _Oxygen
401(k) Plan_ "), effective as of immediately prior to the Closing Date.
Following the Effective Time and as soon as practicable following receipt of
a favorable determination letter from the IRS on the termination of the
Oxygen 401(k) Plan, the assets thereof shall be distributed to the
participants, and Carbon shall, to the extent permitted by applicable Law,
permit the Continuing Employees who are then actively employed to make
rollover contributions of "eligible rollover distributions" (within the
meaning of Section 401(a)(31) of the Code, inclusive of loans to the extent
permitted by Carbon's applicable 401(k) plan), in the form of cash, in an
amount equal to the full account balance (including loans to the extent
permitted by Carbon's applicable 401(k) plan) distributed to such Continuing
Employee from the Oxygen 401(k) Plan to Carbon's applicable 401(k) plan. The
parties will cooperate in good faith to arrange for the repayment of
participant loans prior to the Effective Time or to facilitate the
continuation of such loans following the Effective Time to the extent
practical and commercially reasonable.

  

(d)  Nothing in this Agreement shall confer upon any employee,
officer, director or consultant of Carbon or Oxygen or any of their
Subsidiaries or affiliates any right to continue in the employ or service of
Oxygen, Carbon or any Subsidiary or affiliate thereof, or shall interfere
with or restrict in any way the rights of Oxygen, Carbon or any Subsidiary or
affiliate thereof to discharge or terminate the services of any employee,
officer, director or consultant of Carbon or Oxygen or any of their
Subsidiaries or affiliates at any time for any reason whatsoever, with or
without cause. Nothing in this Agreement shall be deemed to (i)
establish, amend, or modify any Oxygen Benefit Plan, New Benefit Plan or any
other benefit or employment plan, program, agreement or arrangement, or (ii)
alter or limit the ability of Carbon or any of its Subsidiaries or affiliates
to amend, modify or terminate any particular Oxygen Benefit Plan, New Benefit
Plan or any other benefit or employment plan, program, agreement or
arrangement after the Effective Time. Without limiting the generality of the
final sentence of Section 9.11, nothing in this Agreement, express or

 __6.4   _Indemnification; Directors ' and Officers'
Insurance_. 

  

(a)  From and after the Effective Time, Carbon shall cause the
Surviving Company and its Subsidiaries, to (i) indemnify and hold harmless
each of its present and former directors and officers (collectively, the "
_Indemnified Parties_ ") against any costs or expenses (including reasonable
attorneys' fees), judgments, fines, losses, claims, damages or liabilities
incurred in connection with any Proceedings, arising out of or pertaining to
matters existing or occurring at or prior to the Effective Time, including
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and actions relating to the
enforcement of this Section 6.4, whether asserted or claimed prior to, at or
after the Effective Time, to the fullest extent that Oxygen or such
Subsidiary, as the case may be, would have been permitted under its
respective organizational documents in effect on the date of this Agreement or
agreements in existence as of the date hereof and set forth on Section 6.4(a)
of the Oxygen Disclosure Schedule providing for indemnification between
Oxygen or any of its Subsidiaries and any Indemnified Party, subject to
limitations imposed by applicable Law (including the advancing of expenses as
incurred to the fullest extent permitted under applicable Law); _provided_ ,
the Person to whom such expenses are

advanced provides an undertaking to the Surviving Company to repay such
advances if it is ultimately determined that such Person is not entitled to
indemnification).

  

(b)  For six (6) years after the Effective Time, Carbon shall
cause the Surviving Company to maintain in effect, at its own
expense, directors' and officers' liability and fiduciary liability insurance
covering those Persons who are currently covered by Oxygen's directors' and
officers' liability and fiduciary liability insurance policies (true, correct
and complete copies of which have been heretofore delivered to Carbon) either
through continuation of the current policy or substitution by Carbon of
another policy therefor on terms, including with respect to coverage and
insurance limits (with no retention), with an insurer or insurers that have
at the time such coverage is written the same or higher A.M. Best rating as
Carbon's current primary insurer for such type of insurance, not materially
less favorable than the terms of such current insurance coverage with respect
to claims arising from or related to facts or events which occurred at or
prior to the Effective Time (including the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement); _provided_ that in complying with its obligations pursuant to the
terms of this Section 6.4(b), Carbon shall not be required to expend annually
in the aggregate an amount in excess of 250% of the annual premium
currently paid by Oxygen (which current amount is set forth on Section 6.4(b)
of the Oxygen Disclosure Schedule) (the " _Premium Cap_ ") and if Carbon
cannot obtain such insurance coverage without paying in excess of the Premium
Cap, Carbon shall purchase such insurance with the maximum aggregate coverage
available for the Premium Cap. In lieu of the foregoing insurance coverage
and in satisfaction of its obligations under this Section 6.4(b), Carbon may
direct Oxygen to purchase, at Carbon's expense, a six (6) year prepaid "tail
policy" that provides the coverage in this Section 6.4(b); _provided,_
_further_ that if the premium for such "tail coverage" exceeds the Premium
Cap, then Carbon may, at its sole cost, direct Oxygen to obtain "tail
coverage" with the maximum aggregate coverage available for the Premium Cap
applied over the term of such policy.

Surviving Company or any of their respective successors or assigns (i)
consolidates with or merges into any other person and is not the continuing or
surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation or merger or (ii)
transfers or conveys all or a substantial portion of its properties and other
assets to any person, then, and in each case, Carbon or the Surviving
Company, as applicable, shall cause proper provision to be made so that such
successors and assigns shall expressly assume the obligations set forth in
this Section 6.4.

  

(d)  The provisions of this Section 6.4 are intended for the
benefit of, and will be enforceable by, each Indemnified Party, his or her
heirs and his or her representatives and are in addition to, are not in
substitution for, any other rights to indemnification or contribution that
any such person may have from Carbon, the Surviving Company, or any of their
Subsidiaries or any other person by contract or otherwise except as expressly
provided herein. The obligations of Carbon under this Section 6.4 shall not be
terminated or modified in such a manner as to adversely affect the rights of
any Indemnified Party to whom this Section 6.4 applies unless (x) such
termination or modification is required by applicable Law or (y) the affected
Indemnified Party has consented in writing to such termination or
modification.

would or would be reasonably likely to cause or constitute a material breach
of any of its representations, warranties or covenants contained herein;
_provided_ that any failure to give notice in accordance with the foregoing
with respect to any breach shall not be deemed to constitute a violation of
this Section 6.7 or the failure of any condition set forth in Section 7.2 or
7.3 to be satisfied, or otherwise constitute a breach of this Agreement by
the party failing to give such notice, in each case unless the underlying
breach would independently result in a failure of the conditions set forth in
Section 7.2 or 7.3 to be satisfied.

  

(b)  Carbon and Oxygen shall each promptly advise the other
party of (i) any notice or other communication from any Person alleging that

exchange. Without limiting the reach of the preceding sentence, Oxygen and

appropriate management available at presentations related to the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement as reasonably requested by the other party.

not take any action that would cause the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement to be subject to requirements imposed by any Takeover Statute. If
any Takeover Statute may become, or may purport to be, applicable to the

the members of their respective Boards of Directors shall grant such approvals
and take such actions as are necessary so that the transactions contemplated

Subsidiaries in cash, credit or a reduction in Taxes otherwise payable in each
case during the taxable period ending on or prior to the Closing Date as a
result of (and to the extent of) the payment and proper current deduction of
such Transaction Expenses in, and the proper allocation of such Transaction
Expenses and Retention Amounts to, such period (the " _Estimated Transaction
Expense Tax Benefits_ ") and deliver to Carbon and Oxygen, at least twenty
(20) Business Days prior to the Closing Date, a written report setting forth
its good faith estimate of the amount of the Estimated Transaction Expense Tax
Benefits, including a reasonably detailed explanation of the reasons for such
determination (the " _Transaction Tax Analysis_ "), which analysis shall (i)

by Oxygen to KPMG LLP (ii) use an assumed combined federal and state tax rate

Carbon and Oxygen) will be binding on the parties for the purpose of this
Section 6.14 (such final and binding analysis, the " _Final Transaction Tax

cause of action to which such party is entitled at law or in equity.

Agreement and any signed agreement or instrument entered into in connection
with this Agreement, and any amendments or waivers hereto or thereto, to the
extent signed and delivered by means of a facsimile machine or by e-mail
delivery of a ".pdf" format data file, shall be treated in all manner and
respects as an original agreement or instrument and shall be considered to
have the same binding legal effect as if it were the original signed version
thereof delivered in person. No party hereto or to any such agreement or
instrument shall raise the use of a facsimile machine or e-mail delivery of a
".pdf" format data file to deliver a signature to this Agreement or any
amendment hereto or the fact that any signature or agreement or instrument
was transmitted or communicated through the use of a facsimile machine or
e-mail delivery of a ".pdf" format data file as a defense to the formation of
a contract and each party hereto forever waives any such defense.

  

 __9.14   _Valuation Dispute_. If Oxygen and Carbon are not
initially in agreement with respect to the amount of an FDIC Payment or GSE
Payment that would be reflected as a Transaction Expense in the calculation of

parties shall seek in good faith to resolve their differences and agree on an
amount within ten (10) Business Days. If, at the end of such ten (10) Business
Day period, such amount or amounts still remain in dispute, then within two
(2) Business Days following the end of such period, Carbon and Oxygen shall
each submit in writing to a nationally recognized independent valuation firm
reasonably agreed by Oxygen and Carbon (the "Independent Valuation Firm") an
amount that shall be its best and final offer as to the amount of such FDIC
Payment or GSE Payment, as applicable (as to each, its "Final Offer"). The
Independent Valuation Firm shall be instructed to select the Final Offer that
is closest to the value of the FDIC Payment or GSE Payment, as the case may
be, as determined by the Independent Valuation Firm in accordance with the
terms of this Agreement. The Final Offer selected by the Independent Valuation
Firm shall serve as the final, binding resolution of the amount of the FDIC
Payment or GSE Payment, as applicable, that would be reflected as a
Transaction Expense if paid by Oxygen and such selection of a Final Offer by
the Independent Valuation Firm shall be (i) in writing and signed by the
Independent Valuation Firm, (ii) furnished to Carbon and Oxygen as soon as
practicable after the items in dispute have been referred to the Independent
Valuation Firm, which shall not be more than twenty (20) Business Days after
such referral, and (iii) conclusive and binding upon Carbon and Oxygen on the
date of delivery of such written resolution (other than in the case of
fraud). Carbon and Oxygen agree to cooperate with the Independent Valuation
Firm and to promptly provide all documents and information reasonably
requested by the Independent Valuation Firm so as to enable it to make its
determination as quickly and as accurately as possible. The fees and expenses
of the Independent Valuation Firm shall be borne by the party whose Final
Offer is not selected by the Independent Valuation Firm; provided that any
fees and expenses borne by Oxygen shall be Transaction Expenses.
