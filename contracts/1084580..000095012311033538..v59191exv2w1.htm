Seller a written objection (" _Seller s Objection_") setting forth
a specific description of the basis of Sellers objection and the adjustments
to the Closing Balance Sheet and Closing Net Book Value Seller believes
should be made. If no Sellers Objection is received within 30 days after
delivery of the Closing Balance Sheet, the Closing Balance Sheet and the

Entities, but in no event earlier than seven days prior to the due date for
paying such Taxes. 

   

 (c) Any Tax refunds of the Transferred Entities and/or Seller or its Affiliates that are received by Buyer or the Transferred Entities, and any amounts credited against Tax to which the Transferred Entities and/or Buyer or its Affiliates (only with respect to the Commodities Business) become entitled, that relate to a Pre-Closing Period shall be for the account of Seller to the extent such refund or credit was not reflected on or reserved for (other than by merely being noted) in the calculation of the Final Net Book Value, and Buyer shall pay over to Seller any such refund or the amount of any such credit within 15 days after receipt or application of any such credit against Tax, net of any Taxes or reasonable out-of-pocket expenses attributable to the recovery of such refund or credit. 

   ##### 

  

  

 (d) Except as required by Law, Buyer shall not (and shall not allow the Transferred Entities or the Transferred Assets to) amend any Tax Return, or make or amend any material claim, disclaimer or election in respect of Tax, for a taxable period or part of a taxable period ending on or prior to the Closing Date, without the prior written consent of Seller, which consent will not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed. 

  

 (e) Cooperation 

   

 (i) Buyer, the Transferred Entities, Seller and their respective Affiliates shall provide each other with such assistance as may reasonably be requested by the others in connection with the preparation and filing of any Tax Return (including, without limitation, signing any Tax Return), any audit or other examination by any Taxing Authority, or any judicial or administrative proceedings relating to Liabilities for Taxes. Such assistance shall include making employees available on a mutually convenient basis to provide additional information or explanation of material provided hereunder and shall include providing copies of relevant Tax Returns and supporting material. The party requesting assistance hereunder shall reimburse the assisting party for reasonable out-of-pocket expenses incurred in providing assistance. Buyer, the Transferred Entities and Seller will retain for the full period of any statute of limitations, and upon reasonable request will provide the others with, any records or information which may be relevant to such preparation, audit, examination, proceeding or determination. 

   

 (ii) To assist Seller and its Affiliates to comply with their U.S. Tax Return obligations, Seller will deliver to Buyer an information request in a similar manner provided to the non-U.S. Transferred Entities in prior years, and consistent with past practice the non-U.S. Transferred Entities shall use reasonable efforts to promptly complete such information request. 

  

 (f) If any Taxing Authority issues to the Transferred Entities and/or the Transferred Assets a written notice of its intent to audit, examine or conduct a proceeding (including a Notice of Assessment) with respect to Taxes or Tax Returns of the Transferred Entities and/or the Transferred Assets (a " _Tax Claim_ ") for a Pre-Closing Period or a Straddle Period, Buyer shall notify Seller of its receipt of such communication within ten Business Days following receipt;  _provided_ that the failure to notify Seller shall not relieve Seller of any Liability that it may have to Buyer or any other Person under this _Section 5.5_, except to the extent that Seller demonstrates that the defense of such Tax Claim is materially prejudiced by Buyers failure to give such notice. Seller shall control any examination, investigation, audit, or other proceeding in respect of any Tax Claim (a " _Tax Contest_ ") involving Taxes for which Seller is responsible; _provided_ that Seller shall provide Buyer with copies of all material notices and keep Buyer informed as to the conduct of such Tax Contest; and _provided_ ,  _further_ , that Buyer, at its sole cost and expense, shall have the right to participate in any such Tax Contest. 

   ##### 

  

 

Buyer and Seller shall jointly control any Tax Claim relating to a Straddle
Period. If Seller fails to undertake the defense of or settle or pay any Tax
Claim within 30 days after Buyer has given written notice to Seller of the
claim, or if Seller, after having given such notification to Buyer, fails
within 30 days to defend, settle or pay such claim, then Buyer may (but shall
not be required to) take any and all necessary action to dispose of such
claim at the sole cost, expense and risk of Seller; _provided_ , _however_ ,
that in no event shall Buyer settle such claim without the prior consent of
Seller, such consent not to be unreasonably withheld, delayed
or conditioned.

Any Transfer Taxes resulting from any subsequent increase in Purchase Price shall be borne in accordance with the provisions of this _Section 5.5(g)(i)_.

Seller will, at the Closing, provide to Buyers solicitors copies of the memorandum and articles of association of Bache HK, the most recent annual accounts and any subsequent management accounts of Bache HK and will, following the Closing, promptly provide to Buyers solicitors any other documentation which Buyers solicitors may reasonably request in connection with the submission to the Hong Kong Stamp Office contemplated by this subclause. Each of Buyer and Seller shall equally bear the stamp duty in respect of the transfer of the shares of Bache HK and undertakes to the other that it will provide to Buyers solicitor a check in favor of "The Government of Hong Kong Special Administration Region" equal

immediately on demand by Buyers solicitors. 

  

 (h) Section 338 Elections; Election Allocations 

   

 (i) Buyer and Seller shall jointly make an election under Section 338(h)(10) of the Code (and any corresponding elections under state or local Law) with respect to PBAM and PBFSI (each, a " _Section 338(h)(10) Election_"). Seller shall pay any Taxes resulting from the making of the Section 338(h)(10) Elections. 

   

 (ii) Buyer shall make an election under Section 338(g) of the Code (and any corresponding elections under state or local Law) with respect to BCL and PBFL (each, a " _Section 338(g) Election_"). 

   

 (iii) At the Closing, Seller will deliver to Buyer an IRS Form 8023, and any similar form provided for under state, local or foreign law, reflecting each Section 338(h)(10) Election, each fully executed by Seller. As requested from time to time by Buyer (whether before, at or after the Closing), Seller shall assist and provide the necessary information to Buyer in connection with the preparation of any form or document required to effect a valid and timely Section 338(h)(10) Election, including IRS Form 8883, any similar form under state, local or other law and any schedules or attachments thereto (collectively, " _Section 338 Forms_"). Upon delivery of any Section 338 Form by Buyer to Seller, Seller shall duly and promptly execute such form and deliver it to Buyer. If Buyer determines that any change is to be made in a Section 338 Form previously executed and delivered to Buyer, then Buyer may prepare a new Section 338 Form and deliver such new Section 338 Form to Seller, and Seller shall duly and promptly execute such form and deliver it to Buyer. 

   

 (iv) With respect to each Section 338(h)(10) Election, as soon as practicable after the Closing Date, Buyer shall determine (i) ADSP and (ii) the allocation of ADSP among the assets of the Transferred Entities, (the " _Election Allocations_ "). The Election Allocations shall be determined in accordance with Section 338 of the Code and the applicable Treasury Regulations thereunder. At least (30) days prior to the latest date for the filing of each Section 338 Form, Buyer shall prepare and submit to Seller such Section 338 Form setting forth, to the extent required therein, the Election Allocations. Seller and its Affiliates will (i) file or cause to be filed all Tax Returns in a manner consistent with the Election Allocations and (ii) not take any action inconsistent therewith.

 (i) VAT Arrangements 

   

 (i) In determining for the purposes of this _Section 5.5(i)_ by or to whom a chargeable supply is made or is deemed to be made, the deeming provisions of Section 43 VATA shall be ignored. 

   

 (ii) For the purposes of this _Section 5.5(i)_, " _Buyer s VAT_" shall mean any Output Tax in respect of any chargeable supplies, self-supplies, acquisitions or importations made or deemed to be made by BCL in the period during which it is a member of Sellers VAT Group, less any allowable Input Tax incurred or deemed to be incurred in such a period by BCL in respect of any chargeable supplies, self-supplies, acquisitions or importations made or deemed to be made to BCL but only to the extent that BCL has not already made a payment in respect of any such liability or Buyer would not have been entitled to make a successful claim under _Section 5.5(a)_ in respect of such VAT had such VAT been a liability solely of BCL (and _Section 7.2(b)_ shall be disregarded for the purposes of determining whether any VAT would be recoverable by Buyer under  _Section 5.5(a)_ for the purposes of this definition). 

   

 (iii) Buyer and Seller shall cooperate to procure that BCL leaves Sellers VAT Group, so far as it is still a member, and for the exclusion to take effect, to the extent possible, no later than the Closing. 

   

 (iv) Subject to _Section 5.5(i)(vii)_, Buyer shall pay (or procure that BCL pays) to Seller, or as Seller directs, the amount of any Buyers VAT to be paid by Seller or any other member of Sellers VAT Group to HM Revenue and Customs (or which would be paid but for the availability to any member of Sellers VAT Group of any Tax Relief), such payment to be made in cleared funds not later than three Business Days before it is due to HM Revenue and Customs (or would have been due but for the availability of a Tax Relief). Where the amount of any Buyers VAT is subsequently adjusted or discovered to be incorrect, Buyer or Seller shall as soon as is practicable after such adjustment or discovery make or procure the appropriate payment to the other. 

   

 (v) Seller shall, in respect of the period up to the VAT Exit Date, procure that the representative member of Sellers VAT Group accounts for VAT in respect of the supplies, self supplies, acquisitions and importations made or deemed to be made by BCL and the entitlement to Input Tax in respect of the supplies, self supplies, acquisitions and importations made or deemed to be made to BCL and that it submits the VAT returns of Sellers VAT Group within the requisite time period for so doing together with payment for the appropriate amount as represented on the relevant VAT return. 

   

 (vi) Buyer shall provide or procure to be provided to Seller upon request any information and documents in the possession, custody or power of Buyer or any Transferred Entity which are required by any company in Sellers 

   ##### 

  

    

VAT Group in connection with calculating the VAT liability of Sellers VAT
Group or complying with any requirements in respect of VAT. 

   

 (vii) Where allowable Input Tax incurred or deemed to be incurred by BCL in respect of the supplies, self supplies, acquisitions and importations made or deemed to be made to BCL in the period beginning after Closing and ending on the VAT Exit Date exceeds the Output Tax in respect of chargeable supplies, self supplies, acquisitions and importations made or deemed to be made by BCL in such a period, Seller shall pay or procure the payment to Buyer of an amount equal to the excess to the extent that BCL has not previously received a payment in respect of such excess from any member of Sellers VAT Group prior to Closing, no later than five Business Days after the end of the Prescribed Accounting Period to which such excess relates. 

   

 (viii) Without prejudice to _Section 5.5(i)(iii)_, Seller covenants with Buyer that it will pay to Buyer an amount equal to the amount of any Losses (including, without limitation, any amount of VAT) which arises as a result of BCL (being included in Sellers VAT Groups registration) being liable to account to HM Revenue and Customs for VAT on actual or deemed supplies, self supplies, importations or acquisitions made for VAT purposes by other members of Sellers VAT Group (not being BCL) before the VAT Exit Date. 

  

 (j) Surrender of Group Relief 

   

 (i) Buyer shall allow Seller to reduce or eliminate any Tax Liability of a Transferred Entity in respect of which it would otherwise be liable under this Agreement by surrendering or procuring the surrender of Group Relief to the extent permitted by Law but without any payment being made in consideration for such surrender. 

   

 (ii) Buyer shall procure that each Transferred Entity shall (so far as possible in Law) surrender or otherwise make available to Seller or to such member of Sellers Group as Seller may specify, for no consideration except for any consideration that has been paid on or prior to the Closing or consideration that has not been paid at the Closing and is taken into account as an asset in the Final Closing Balance Sheet, all such Group Relief as Seller may at its sole discretion direct in writing in respect of any Tax accounting period of the Transferred Entity commencing on or before the Closing other than to the extent that the relevant Tax Relief has been taken into account as an asset in the Final Closing Balance Sheet or to reduce or eliminate a provision for Tax in the Final Closing Balance Sheet. 

   

 (iii) Buyer hereby undertakes that it shall, and shall procure that each Transferred Entity will, use all reasonable endeavors to procure that full effect is given to the surrenders to be made under this subclause (j) and (without prejudice to the generality of the foregoing) Buyer shall procure that the 

   ##### 

  

    

Transferred Entity shall, to the extent relevant, sign and submit to the
relevant Taxing Authority all such notices of consent to surrender (including
provisional or protective notices of consent in cases where any relevant Tax
computation has not yet been agreed) and all such other documents and returns
as may be necessary to secure that full effect is given to this clause. 

  

 (k) To the extent that any VAT is chargeable on any supply pursuant to this Agreement, the Person making the supply (the " _Supplier_ ") shall deliver to the recipient of the supply (the " _Recipient_ "): (i) a valid VAT invoice where required by Applicable Local Law or practice; and (ii) any other documentation as may be reasonably requested by the Recipient to assist it to recover the VAT chargeable or payable, in each case, in such form and within such timing as may be required by Law. An amount equal to the amount of VAT chargeable to or payable by the Supplier on the supply shall be paid in addition to the consideration provided in this Agreement, by the Recipient to the Supplier within five Business Days of receipt of a valid VAT invoice (or where no invoice is required, within five Business Days of demand) or, if later, two Business Days before the date on which the obligation to account for the VAT would have had to be discharged in order to avoid liability to interest or a charge or penalty. The Supplier shall account for all amounts in respect of the VAT paid to it by the Recipient to the appropriate Government Entities in compliance with Applicable Local Law. 

  

 (l) Buyer shall promptly notify Seller in the event that any liability to Tax of a Transferred Entity or another member of Buyers Group, except a liability for which Buyer would otherwise have been able to claim indemnification under _Section 5.5(a)_, is actually reduced as a result of the use of the U.K. Capital Loss and the amount of any such reduction or reductions shall be dealt with as follows, to the extent that in aggregate they exceed the asset, if any, taken into account in the Closing Balance Sheet in respect of the U.K. Capital Loss: 

   

 (i) Each relevant amount shall first be set against any payment then due under  _Section 5.5(a)_ or in respect of any breach of any warranty in _Section 3.8_,  _Section 3.9(j)_, _Section 3.20(b)_ and _Section 3.20(d)_ ( _provided_ that in the case of _Section 3.9(j)_, _Section 3.20(b)_ and  _Section 3.20(d)_ only to the extent such breach is in relation to Taxes); 

   

 (ii) To the extent there is an excess, a refund shall promptly be made to Seller of any previous payment made under _Section 5.5(a)_ or in respect of any breach of any warranty in _Section 3.8_, _Section 3.9(j)_, _Section 3.20(b)_ and  _Section 3.20(d)_ ( _provided_ that in the case of _Section 3.9(j)_,  _Section 3.20(b)_ and _Section 3.20(d)_ only to the extent such breach is in relation to Taxes) and not previously refunded under this Section, to the extent of any excess; and 

   

 (iii) To the extent the excess is not exhausted under the previous subparagraph, the remainder of that excess shall be carried forward and setoff against any future payment or payments which become due under _Section 5.5(a)_ 

   ##### 

  

    

or in respect of any breach of any warranty in _Section 3.8_,
_Section 3.9(j)_ , _Section 3.20(b)_ and _Section 3.20(d)_ ( _provided_
that in the case of _Section 3.9(j)_, _Section 3.20(b)_ and _Section
3.20(d)_ only to the extent such breach is in relation to Taxes). 

  

 (m) Any and all Tax allocation or sharing agreements or other Contracts relating to Tax matters between the Transferred Entities on the one hand and Seller or any of its Affiliates on the other hand shall be terminated with respect to the Transferred Entities as of the day before the Closing Date and, from and after the Closing Date, the Transferred Entities shall not be obligated to make any payment to Seller or any of its Affiliates, any Taxing Authority or any other Person pursuant to any such Contracts for any future period. 

  

 (n) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, this _Section 5.5_ shall exclusively govern all claims for indemnification with respect to the Tax matters set forth in this  _Section 5.5_, and in the event of any conflict between this _Section 5.5_ and any other provision of this Agreement (including _ARTICLE VII_ ), this _Section 5.5_ shall govern. For the avoidance of doubt, all indemnification payments made pursuant to this _Section 5.5_ shall not be subject to the Deductible Amount and Cap provided for in _ARTICLE VII_. 

  

 Section 5.6 _Certain Employees_. 

  

 (a) An updated copy of the employee lists provided on Sections 3.9(g) and 3.9(h) of the Seller Disclosure Letter shall be provided to Buyer at least ten but not more than 15 Business Days prior to the Closing Date. 

  

 (b) Buyer shall offer employment on the terms and conditions set forth in clauses (i) and (ii) of _Section 5.6(c)_ below to each of the Employees that are actively employed by Seller immediately prior to the Closing Date and as named on Section 3.9(g) of the Seller Disclosure Letter, which employment shall commence on the Closing Date. Prior to the Closing Date, Seller shall provide Buyer reasonable access to such Employees, and, to the extent permitted by Applicable Local Law, such Employees personnel records and such other related employment information as Buyer may reasonably request following the date hereof. Each such Employee who accepts Buyers offer of employment, together with the Employees of the Transferred Entities as of the Closing Date shall be a " _Transferred Employee_ " for purposes of this Agreement as of the Closing Date. Seller shall use its reasonable best efforts to assist Buyer in connection with any effort by Buyer to employ or retain any such Employee(s) or retain any contractor and/or consultants to whom Buyer has offered employment or any contractor/consulting arrangement; _provided_ that Seller shall not be required to terminate any such Employee or contractor or offer any such Employee or contractor additional remuneration in order to incentivize such Employee or contractor to accept Buyers offer. 

  

 (c) Buyer will not reduce the base salary or wage rate of any Transferred Employee in effect immediately prior to the Closing Date and disclosed on Section 3.9(g) of the Seller Disclosure Letter solely as a result of the Transaction. For at 

   ##### 

  

 

least the period beginning on the Closing Date and through the first
anniversary of the Closing Date, each Transferred Employee shall be entitled
to participate in retirement and welfare plans and policies that are no less
favorable in the aggregate than the retirement and welfare plans and policies
provided to similarly situated employees of Buyer or its current
Affiliates (based upon which entity will employ such Transferred Employee
following the Closing Date). For at least (i) the period beginning on the
Closing Date and through the 60th day following the Closing Date, each
Transferred Employee shall be eligible to receive severance benefits
from Buyer that are no less favorable than those severance benefits provided
immediately prior to Closing Date under Sellers or any of its Affiliates
applicable severance plans, programs or practices (collectively, " _Seller s
Severance Plan_") as in effect as of the date hereof and as disclosed on
Section 3.10(a) of the Seller Disclosure Letter, and (ii) the period beginning
on the 61st day following the Closing Date and through the first anniversary
of the Closing Date, each Transferred Employee shall be eligible to receive
severance benefits from Buyer that are no less favorable than those severance
benefits provided to similarly situated employees of Buyer or its current
Affiliates (based upon which entity will employ such Transferred Employee
following the Closing Date). Buyer shall promptly reimburse Seller for any
severance Seller or any of its Affiliates is required under its current
severance plans or agreements to pay to any Employee who is entitled to
severance due to Buyers noncompliance with this _Section 5.6_. Buyer
shall promptly notify Seller of (i) the termination of employment of any
Transferred Employee that occurs during the period from the 61st day
following the Closing Date through the first anniversary of the Closing Date,
(ii) the circumstances of such termination of employment, and (iii) the
amount of severance paid to such Transferred Employee by Buyer or any of its
Affiliates; and Seller may, in its sole discretion, determine to pay to Buyer
for the benefit of any such Transferred Employee the difference between (1)
the amount of severance paid by Buyer and any of its Affiliates, and (2) the
amount of severance such Transferred Employee would have been eligible to
receive under Sellers Severance Plan, plus the amount of Employer Tax
Liability (as defined in  _Section 5.6(i)_) on such difference; _provided_
that, to the extent Seller determines to make such payment, Buyer shall, or
shall cause one of its Affiliates to, (A) pay such amount to the applicable
Transferred Employee as soon as practicable (but in no event more than ten
Business Days) following receipt by Buyer of such payment from Seller, (B)
withhold employee income tax, social security and other applicable taxes
associated with such payment based on the applicable withholding tax rate for
the Transferred Employee who receives such payment, and (C) remit an amount
equal to the Employee Tax Liability and Employer Tax Liability to the local
Taxing Authority. Notwithstanding _Section 5.6(b)_ or _Section 5.6(c)_ of
this Agreement and except as otherwise prohibited under Applicable Local Law,
Buyer may change the job titles of any Transferred Employee, and may make
other non-compensatory changes to terms and conditions of employment, solely
to conform to Buyers employment policies and procedures. 

   

 (d) To the extent permitted by Applicable Local Law, prior to the Closing Seller shall: (i) cause the employment of any Employee who is on long-term disability leave and in receipt of long-term disability benefits (other than Employees in 

   ##### 

  

 

Germany and Employees subject to Hong Kong employment law), which for the
avoidance of doubt, in the U.K. shall mean any Employee who has an actual or
pending claim under the group income protection policy, to be transferred to
Seller or an Affiliate of Seller (other than a Transferred Entity) and shall
continue to provide long-term disability benefits to any such Employee; and
(ii) cause the employment of any Employee who is on short-term disability
leave (other than Employees in the U.K. and Germany and Employees subject to
Hong Kong employment law) to be transferred to Seller or an Affiliate of
Seller (other than a Transferred Entity) and shall continue to provide short-
term disability benefits to any such Employee. If, within six months following
the Closing, any such Employee on short-term disability leave is approved to
return to active employment, Buyer shall immediately employ such Employee and
such Employee shall be considered a Transferred Employee for the purposes of
this _Section 5.6_. For the avoidance of doubt, all Employees of the German
branch of BCL will continue to be Employees of the German branch of BCL and
become Transferred Employees at Closing, and all Employees of Bache HK will
continue to be Employees of Bache HK and become Transferred Employees at
Closing. Any Employee in the U.K. who has an actual or pending claim under
the group income protection policy shall be transferred to Seller or
an Affiliate of Seller prior to Closing and shall continue to receive long-
term disability benefits. Any Employee in the U.K. who is on any other leave,
and who does not have an actual or pending claim under the group income
protection policy will remain employed by BCL at Closing. 

   

 (e) With respect to any medical, dental and other welfare plans (other than U.S. life insurance plans) maintained by Buyer or any of its Affiliates (including the Transferred Entities), in which any Employee is eligible to participate, Buyer shall or shall cause such plan to (i) cause to be waived thereunder any pre-existing condition, actively-at-work requirements, evidence of insurability or good health and waiting periods to the extent such requirements and waiting periods were satisfied under similar plans of Seller or any of its Affiliates (including the Transferred Entities), and (ii) cause such plans to honor any expenses incurred by the Employees and their beneficiaries or dependents under similar plans of Seller or any of its Affiliates (including the Transferred Entities) during the portion of the calendar year in which the Closing Date occurs for purposes of satisfying applicable plan, co-insurance and maximum out-of-pocket expenses or any like or similar expenses or costs. 

  

 (f) Employees shall be given credit for all service with Seller or any of its Affiliates (including the Transferred Entities) to the same extent as such service was credited for such purpose by Seller or any of its Affiliates (including the Transferred Entities), under each relevant Buyer plan (other than for U.S. life insurance plans) in which such Employees are eligible to participate for purposes of eligibility, vesting and level of severance and paid time off benefits (but not for purposes of benefit accrual) to the extent permitted under Applicable Local Law. 

  

 (g) Except as set forth on Section 5.6(g) of the Seller Disclosure Letter, from and after the Closing Date, Buyer shall assume, honor, and be solely 

   ##### 

  

 

responsible for paying, providing or satisfying when due all accrued but
unused vacation, sick pay or other paid time off for the Transferred
Employees as of the Closing Date; _provided_  that Buyer may require the
Transferred Employees to take vacation in accordance with Buyers vacation
plans and policies to the extent permitted by Applicable Local Law (but
Buyers vacation plans or policies shall not cause such Transferred Employees
to forfeit any such accrued but unused vacation, sick pay or other paid time
off other than in the event that such Transferred Employee has not taken
accrued but unused vacation by the end of the relevant fiscal year). 

   

 (h) For the avoidance of doubt, as of the Closing Date, Transferred Employees shall cease to actively participate in any Seller Benefit Plan. 

  

 (i) With respect to each Transferred Employee that holds unvested stock options under the Prudential Financial Inc. Omnibus Incentive Plan (which is a successor plan to the Prudential Financial Inc. Stock Option Plan) and any subplan thereto (the " _Omnibus Incentive Plan_ ") as of the Closing, such stock options shall vest in accordance with the terms of the Omnibus Incentive Plan. To the extent that a Transferred Employee or former Employee exercises an option to purchase Seller stock or otherwise vests in a share incentive award over Seller stock granted or issued under the Omnibus Incentive Plan, following the Closing, Seller shall (i) within ten Business Days notify Buyer of such exercise or vesting and provide Buyer with the information related to the stock option exercise or vesting in Sellers possession to calculate the amount of the Employee Tax Liability that may arise as a result of such exercise or vesting, (ii) withhold employee income tax, social security and other applicable taxes associated with the exercise based on the withholding rate (which must be a percentage that is a whole number) that Buyer has supplied, at least five days prior to the event giving rise to the withholding obligation, to Seller with respect to the applicable withholding tax rate for the Employee who exercises options, and (iii) remit an amount equal to the Employee Tax Liability and Employer Tax Liability to Buyer, along with a copy of the broker report evidencing such exercise not less than five Business Days before the date on which the Employee Tax Liability or Employer Tax Liability must be accounted to the local Taxing Authority. Buyer shall provide notice to Seller at least ten days prior to payments being due to the local Taxing Authority. For the purposes of this _Section 5.6(i)_, " _Employee Tax Liability_ " means any income tax and social security contributions payable by a Transferred Employee or former Employee and for which any Transferred Entity, Buyer or a member of Buyers Group is liable to account in connection with the exercise of an option or the vesting of an award by or in a Transferred Employee or former Employee and " _Employer Tax Liability_ " means any employer taxes payable by any Transferred Entity, Buyer or a member of Buyers Group in connection with the exercise of an option or the vesting of an award by or in a Transferred Employee or former Employee (including, but not limited to, U.S. Federal Insurance Contribution Act taxes and U.K. and German employers social security liability). This provision shall also apply where a Transferred Employee is deemed for tax purposes to have exercised an option, _provided_ that Buyer gives Seller notice of such deemed exercise within five days, in which case Sellers obligations to provide information and to withhold and remit 

   ##### 

  

 

amounts to Buyer as set out above will also apply in the same way to such
deemed exercise. 

   

 (j) Seller shall provide each Transferred Employee with full vesting of any award or benefit under any Seller Benefit Plan set forth in Section 5.6(j) of the Seller Disclosure Letter. 

  

 (k) As of the Closing Date, outstanding restricted stock units held by the Transferred Employees shall vest in accordance with the terms of the Omnibus Incentive Plan. With respect to the restricted stock units held by the Transferred Employees that will be forfeited by the Transferred Employees in accordance with the terms of the Omnibus Incentive Plan as of the Closing Date as a result of the Transaction, Buyer shall grant to each such Transferred Employee a number of restricted stock units or restricted stock with respect to the stock of Buyer (whose aggregate fair market value as of the date of grant shall be no less than the amount calculated in accordance with _Section 2.5(ii)_ multiplied by two (2)) as are equal to the number of such restricted stock units that will be forfeited by such Transferred Employee, without regard to any restricted stock units that are forfeited by the failure of a Transferred Employee to sign a release of claims in favor of Seller, its Affiliates and the Transferred Entities, under the Omnibus Incentive Plan as of the Closing Date (not to exceed 215,150 Seller restricted stock units held by all Transferred Employees in the aggregate and treated as forfeited for purposes of _Section 2.5(ii)_) multiplied by a fraction the numerator of which is the closing price on the New York Stock Exchange of a share of common stock of Seller on the Business Day immediately preceding the Closing Date and the denominator of which is the closing price on the New York Stock Exchange of a share of common stock of Buyer on the Business Day immediately preceding the Closing Date and such restricted stock units or restricted stock of Buyer will contain cliff vesting dates that are the same as the cliff vesting dates of the forfeited restricted stock units of Seller (taking into account and crediting for the period of time that has already lapsed with respect to the forfeited restricted stock units of Seller). 

  

 (l) Seller shall assume and be responsible for (i) claims for workers compensation or for the type of benefits described in Section 3(1) of ERISA (whether or not covered by ERISA) that are incurred on or prior to the Closing Date by Transferred Employees, and (ii) claims relating to COBRA coverage attributable to "qualifying events" occurring on or prior to the Closing Date with respect to any Transferred Employees or former employees and their beneficiaries and dependents. Buyer shall be responsible for (A) disability benefits and workers compensation benefits for Transferred Employees for claims incurred after the Closing Date, and (B) claims relating to COBRA coverage attributable to "qualifying events" occurring after the Closing Date with respect to Transferred Employees and their beneficiaries and dependents. For purposes of the foregoing, a medical/dental claim shall be considered incurred when the medical services are rendered or medical supplies are provided, and not when the condition arose; _provided_ that claims relating to a hospital confinement that commences on or prior to the Closing Date but continues thereafter shall be treated as incurred on or 

   ##### 

  

 

prior to the Closing Date. A disability or workers compensation claim shall
be considered incurred on or prior to the Closing Date if the injury or
condition giving rise to the claim occurs on or prior to the Closing Date. 

   

 (m) Prior to the Closing Date, Seller shall cause the employment of each Non-Commodities Business Employee to be transferred to Seller or an Affiliate of Seller (other than a Transferred Entity), and Seller shall assume all Liabilities in respect of such Non-Commodities Business Employee.

 Section 5.7 _Privacy Compliance_. 

  

 (a) Buyer and Seller acknowledge that they are responsible for their own compliance at all times with Applicable Privacy Laws that govern the collection, use and disclosure of personal information acquired by or disclosed to Buyer pursuant to or in connection with this Agreement (the " _Disclosed Personal Information_ ").

   ##### 

  

  

 (e) If the Closing does not occur or otherwise upon the reasonable request of Seller, Buyer shall forthwith cease all use of the Disclosed Personal Information acquired by Buyer in connection with this Agreement and will return to Seller or, at Sellers request, destroy in a secure manner, the Disclosed Personal Information (and any copies).

 (a) From and after the date hereof, Seller shall treat as confidential and shall safeguard any and all information, knowledge and data relating to the Transferred Entities and the Commodities Business in its possession by using the same degree of care, but no less than a reasonable standard of care, to prevent the unauthorized use, dissemination or disclosure of such information, knowledge and data as Seller used with respect thereto prior to the date hereof, _it_   _being_ _understood_ that Seller may disclose such information to the extent required to comply with Law, the rules of any exchange or pursuant to regulatory request; _provided_  that Seller shall provide as much prior written notice to Buyer of such disclosure as is practical under the circumstances and shall seek to limit such disclosure. 

  

 (b) From and after the Closing, the Confidentiality Agreement shall terminate and Buyer shall have no further liability thereunder, other than for breaches thereunder prior to the Closing. 

  

 (c) From and after the Closing, Buyer shall treat as confidential and shall safeguard any and all information, knowledge or data relating to the business of Seller and its Affiliates (other than the Commodities Business) that becomes known to Buyer as a result of the Transaction except as otherwise agreed to by Seller in writing by using the same degree of care, but no less than a reasonable standard of care, to prevent 

   #####

 (e) In the event of a breach of the obligations hereunder by Buyer or Seller, the other party, in addition to all other available remedies, shall be entitled to injunctive relief to enforce the provisions of this _Section 5.10_ in any court of competent jurisdiction. 

  

 Section 5.11 _Intellectual Property Matters_. 

  

 (a) Buyer, for itself and its Affiliates, acknowledges and agrees that Buyer is not purchasing, acquiring or otherwise obtaining any right, title or interest in or to any Intellectual Property owned or licensed by Seller or its respective Affiliates (other than for the Intellectual Property included in the Transferred Assets), including the names and marks, "Prudential," "Pru," "Pramerica," "the Prudential logo," "the Rock symbol," "P" and "Rock Solid," or any trade, corporate or business names, trademarks, taglines, identifying logos, trade dress, monograms, slogans, service marks, Internet domain names or brand names or any other name or source identifiers related thereto or employing the foregoing wording or any derivation, translation or variation thereof, or any confusingly similar trade name, corporate or business name, trademark, tagline, identifying logo, trade dress, monogram, slogan, service mark, Internet domain name or brand name or other name or source identifier (including any registrations and applications relating thereto) (collectively, " _Seller Intellectual Property_ "), and (i) neither Buyer nor any of its Affiliates (including, after the Closing, the Transferred Entities) shall have any rights in or to Seller Intellectual Property, (ii) at the Closing, Buyer shall cause the Transferred Entities to cease any and all use of Seller Intellectual Property, (iii) Buyer shall provide, at the expense of Seller, any assistance reasonably required by Seller following the Closing in relation to any proceedings regarding Seller Intellectual Property, and (iv) neither Buyer nor any of its Affiliates (including, after the Closing, the Transferred Entities) shall (A) seek to register in any jurisdiction any of Seller Intellectual Property or any trade, corporate or business name, trademark, tagline,

translation, adaptation, combination or variation of Seller Intellectual
Property or that is confusingly similar thereto, or (B) contest the use,
ownership, validity or enforceability of any rights of Seller or any of its
Affiliates in or to any of Seller Intellectual Property. Notwithstanding
anything in this _Section 5.11(a)_ to the contrary, nothing shall prohibit
Buyer, the Transferred Entities, and their respective Affiliates from making
nominative fair use of the trademarks included in the Seller Intellectual
Property, including, by way of example and not limitation, references to
the Transferred Entities corporate history. 

   

 (b) Seller, for itself and its Affiliates, acknowledges and agrees that: 

   

 (i) within 120 days after Closing, Seller shall, and shall cause its Affiliates to (A) remove or cause to be removed any Trademarks that are Transferred Assets or owned by a Transferred Entity, including, by way of example and not limitation, the BACHE mark, previously or currently used by Seller or any of its Affiliates (the " _Transferred Trademarks_ ") from all assets owned by Seller or its Affiliates that are under their control and not Transferred Assets or owned by a Transferred Entity, provided that Seller and its Affiliates need not remove the Transferred Trademarks from reports, documents and other materials kept in accordance with their respective retention policies, or for historical reference, archival purposes or regulatory compliance, and (B) discontinue use of the Transferred Trademarks in the name of or in conjunction with any retained entity or such entitys goods, services, domain names, or marketing materials; 

   

 (ii) Seller acknowledges and agrees that Buyer or an Affiliate of Buyer is the owner of the Transferred Trademarks and all goodwill attached thereto. This Agreement does not give Seller or any of its Affiliates the right to use the Transferred Trademarks except in accordance with this Agreement. Seller will not, and will not cause any of its Affiliates to, attempt to register the Transferred Trademarks nor to register anywhere in the world a mark, domain name, or business name that is the same as or confusingly similar to the Transferred Trademarks; 

   

 (iii) Seller shall, and shall cause its Affiliates to, abandon any existing Trademark registration that contains a combination of a Transferred Trademark and a mark owned by Seller or its Affiliates contained in Seller Intellectual Property, including, by way of example and not limitation, P. BACHE Financial, Prudential-BACHE and Prudential BACHE Commodities, anywhere in the world; _provided_ , _however_ , that Seller may maintain any registrations for Internet domain names that include such combinations so as to prevent others from registering them, but Seller agrees not to use such Internet domain names in any way whatsoever except to resolve to an inactive page; and 

   ##### 

  

   

 (iv) notwithstanding anything in this _Section 5.11(b)_ to the contrary, nothing shall prohibit Seller or any of its respective Affiliates from making nominative fair use of the Transferred Trademarks, including, by way of example and not limitation, references to the Transferred Entities corporate history. 

  

 (c) For purposes of this _Section 5.11(c)_ and _Section 7.2(a)_, " _Licensed Software_ " means Software included in the Owned Intellectual Property (including Software owned by the Transferred Entities) that was used in any of Sellers or its Affiliates systems, Software or applications prior to the Closing Date and is listed on Section 5.11(c) of the Seller Disclosure Letter, as well as any immaterial portions of Software included in the Owned Intellectual Property that may also have been included in any part of other Software of Seller or any of its Affiliates in an incidental manner, and the Intellectual Property rights of Buyer or any Transferred Entity associated therewith. Buyer, on behalf of the Transferred Entities and their respective Affiliates, hereby grants to Seller and each of its Affiliates a perpetual, irrevocable, worldwide, royalty-free, fully paid-up, non-exclusive, sublicenseable to Affiliates, customers, end users, and contractors ( _provided_ that such customers, end users and contractors are not licensed to use the Licensed Software for any purpose other than for its intended use to provide services or to process business of Seller or the applicable Affiliate), and non-transferable (except that Seller and each of its Affiliates may transfer, as limited by the proviso to this parenthetical, the foregoing rights and licenses to a Person in connection with sales or divestitures of a business using the Licensed Software, or mergers, reorganizations, consolidations or other change-in-control transactions; _provided_ that the transferees license shall be no broader than that of the transferor) right and license, effective as of the Closing Date, in, to and under the Licensed Software for the continued use in the respective businesses of Seller and its Affiliates, including the right to use, reproduce, create derivative works, perform, and display. Any transfer made in violation of the foregoing shall be void and of no legal force and effect. Seller acknowledges that the Licensed Software will be provided on an "as is" basis and without representation or warranty of any kind. Under no circumstances will Buyer, the Transferred Entities, or their Affiliates be liable to Seller or any of its Affiliates for damages of any kind arising from Sellers or any of its Affiliates use of the Licensed Software. Buyer, the Transferred Entities and their Affiliates are not obligated to provide support to Seller or any of its Affiliates for the Licensed Software or provide Seller or any of its Affiliates with any updates or upgrades to or any maintenance for the Licensed Software. For the avoidance of doubt, the license granted by this  _Section 5.11(c)_ extends to both the object code and the source code for the Software that was used prior to the Closing Date, and to the extent not already in Sellers possession, Buyer will, during the term of the Transition Services Agreement, upon Sellers request, provide Seller a copy of the source code for any such Software, to the extent the source code is within the possession of Buyer or any of the Transferred Entities and readily available to copy and provide as set forth herein. In the event such source code is not readily available to copy and provide as set forth herein, Buyer will reasonably cooperate with Seller to provide such source code at Sellers expense. Seller shall at all times treat Licensed Software as confidential 

   ##### 

  

 

information of Buyer or the Transferred Entities; _provided_ , _however_ ,
that the foregoing shall not limit the rights and licenses granted pursuant
to this _Section 5.11(c)_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein,
the license granted by Buyer pursuant to this  _Section 5.11(c)_ shall not
be deemed to grant to Seller and its Affiliates the right to, and Seller and
its Affiliates shall not, directly or indirectly, use or authorize others to
use any of the Licensed Software in connection with, the Restricted Business;
_provided_ ,  _however_ , that the foregoing shall not prohibit use of the
Licensed Software in connection with Buyers post-Closing access rights set
forth in _Section 5.1_ or otherwise for Sellers or any of its Affiliates
legal, regulatory or compliance purposes. For the avoidance of doubt, (i) the
license granted under this _Section 5.11(c)_ does not include any rights to
use the Bache Commodity Index for any purpose whatsoever, and (ii) nothing
herein shall preclude Buyer or any Transferred Entity from seeking an
injunction to prohibit the use of the Licensed Software in connection with a
Restricted Business, except as is permitted by the proviso in the
preceding sentence. 

   

 Section 5.12 _Intercompany Contracts_. Prior to the Closing: 

  

 (a) Seller shall terminate or cause to be terminated all Intercompany Contracts other than those set forth on Section 5.12(a) of the Seller Disclosure Letter as to which Seller or any of its Affiliates is a counterparty, and settle or cause to be settled all amounts payable or receivable pursuant to such terminated Intercompany Contracts and all other amounts payable or receivable by the Transferred Entities to or by Seller and its Affiliates except with respect to those amounts payable or receivable pursuant to any Contract set forth on Section 5.12(a) of the Seller Disclosure Letter, prior to Closing. 

  

 (b) Seller shall execute and cause the Transferred Entities to execute amended agreements in respect of those Intercompany Contracts set forth on Section 5.12(b) of the Seller Disclosure Letter on the terms contemplated by Section 5.12(b) of the Seller Disclosure Letter.

Seller and Buyer shall each use their reasonable best efforts to timely obtain any approval, consent, license, sublicense, permit, waiver, order qualification or authorization (a) set forth in Section 3.6 of the Seller Disclosure Letter (including the provision of services under the Transition Services Agreement) (other than those set forth on Section 5.13 of the Seller Disclosure Letter) and (b) such other approval, consent, license, sublicense, permit, waiver, order qualification or authorization not set forth on Section 5.13 of the Seller Disclosure Letter as Buyer shall indicate to Seller with prior written notice ( _provided_ , _however_ , that any such requirement to use reasonable best efforts to timely obtain such approval, consent, license, sublicense, permit, waiver, order qualification or authorization shall commence only upon Sellers receipt of such notice) (each of (a) and (b), a " _Third-Party Consent_ "), in each case, with the other partys participation and cooperation and in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to Seller and Buyer. Buyer and Seller each shall pay fifty percent (50%) of the costs of all Third-Party Consents and any "kill fees" or other penalties (including penalties for unused minimum volume commitments) in connection 

   ##### 

  

 

with procuring any such Third-Party Consent; _provided_ that, to the extent
such costs, fees or penalties are more than _de minimis_ amounts, neither
Buyer nor Seller shall have any obligation to expend such amounts. For the
avoidance of doubt, the term "Third-Party Consent" when used in this _Section
5.13_ shall in no way be construed to mean an "approval,"
"consent," "license," "sublicense," "permit," "waiver," "order,"
"qualification" or "authorization" from a Government Entity except to the
extent such Government Entity is a counterparty to any third-party Contract
with Seller, Buyer or any of their respective Affiliates.

 (e) Seller acknowledges that the restrictions contained in this _Section 5.15_ are reasonable and necessary to protect the legitimate interests of Buyer and constitute a material inducement to Buyer to enter into this Agreement and consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Seller acknowledges that any violation of this _Section 5.15_ will result in irreparable injury to Buyer and agrees that Buyer shall be entitled to preliminary and permanent injunctive relief, without the necessity of proving actual damages, as well as an equitable accounting of all earnings, profits and other benefits arising from any violation of this  _Section 5.15_, which rights shall be cumulative and in addition to any other rights or remedies to which Buyer may be entitled.

Not later than two Business Days prior to the delivery of the Estimated Closing Balance Sheet, Seller may deliver notice to Buyer of its intention to have BCL pay an Excess Capital Dividend.

   ##### 

  

 

party claims related to Sellers use of the Licensed Software following the
Closing, or (ix) any German Pension Plans Liabilities. 

   

 (b) Seller shall have no liability under _Section 7.2(a)(i)_ for any claim for indemnification in respect of Buyer Indemnified Parties and BCLs Losses, (i) which individually (except that if the Losses are a series of related Losses, then in the aggregate) are less than $50,000 ( _provided_ that even if a Loss is less than $50,000, such Loss will be applied to and count for purposes of calculating the aggregate amount of Buyer Indemnified Parties and BCLs Losses under clause (ii) below) and (ii) until the aggregate amount of Buyer Indemnified Parties and BCLs Losses associated with indemnification claims under such Section exceeds $4,000,000 (the " _Deductible Amount_ "), after which Seller shall be obligated for all the Buyer Indemnified Parties and BCLs Losses that are in excess of the Deductible Amount. The maximum liability of Seller under _Section 7.2(a)(i)_ shall not exceed $60,000,000 (the " _Cap_ ").

 (c) Any payments made by or due from Seller pursuant to the terms of this Agreement shall be free and clear of all Taxes whatsoever save only for any deductions or withholdings required by Law. If any deductions or withholdings are required by Law, or any payments made by or due from Seller under this Agreement are liable for taxation (whether in the hands of Buyer, its Affiliates, or any of the Transferred Entities), or would have been liable for taxation but for the utilization of any Tax Relief in respect of such liability, Seller shall be liable under this _Section 7.2(c)_ to pay to Buyer, or the relevant Affiliate or the relevant Transferred Entity (as the case may be) to which the payments are made or due, such further sums as will ensure that the net amount received by Buyer, or the relevant Affiliate or the relevant Transferred Entity (as the case may be) will equal the full amount which would have been received under the relevant provisions of this Agreement in the absence of any such deductions, withholdings or taxation liabilities;  _provided_ , _however_ , that Seller shall not be liable to pay any such further sums to the extent that the payment of such further sums could have been avoided by making the indemnity payment to a different Buyer Indemnified Party. Any additional amounts paid by Seller in accordance with this _Section 7.2(c)_ shall be disregarded for the purposes of _Section 7.2(a)_. If any deduction or withholding is made from any payment under or in connection with this Agreement, the Indemnifying Party will make the payment to the relevant Taxing Authority of the amount deducted or withheld, and will supply to the Indemnified Party, within 30 days of such payment being made, an official receipt or other evidence of such payment and will give all reasonable assistance to enable the Indemnified Party to claim a credit, repayment or other relief in respect of the deduction or withholding as promptly as possible. 

  

 (d) For the avoidance of doubt, each Buyer Indemnified Party shall, without duplication, be entitled to indemnification under Section 7.2(a) with respect to any Loss for which BCL and BCLs directors, officers, shareholders and employees, and 

   ##### 

  

 

their heirs and successors would have been entitled to indemnification, were
BCL a Buyer Indemnified Party. 

   

 Section 7.3 _Indemnification by Buyer_. 

  

 (a) Buyer hereby agrees, that from and after the Closing it shall indemnify, defend and hold harmless Seller, its Affiliates, and their respective directors, officers, shareholders and employees and their heirs and successors, each in their capacity as such (the " _Seller Indemnified Parties_ ") from, against and in respect of any Losses imposed on, or asserted against, any of the Seller Indemnified Parties, to the extent arising out of or in respect of (i) any breach of any representation or warranty made by Buyer contained in this Agreement for the period such representation or warranty survives (in each case without giving effect to any limitations as to materiality set forth therein), (ii) any breach of a covenant or agreement of Buyer contained in this Agreement, (iii) any of the Assumed Liabilities, (iv) all Liabilities of the Transferred Entities, except for the Liabilities contemplated to be indemnified by Seller pursuant to _Section 7.2(a)(iv)_, _Section 7.2(a)(v)_, _Section 7.2(a)(vi)_ and  _Section 7.2(a)(ix)_, (v) any Transferred Asset or any asset, right or property of the Transferred Entities (including any Contract or Governmental Authorization included in the Transferred Assets or the assets, rights or properties of the Transferred Entities) as a result of the operation or the conduct of the Commodities Business by Buyer and/or any of its Affiliates following the Closing, or (vi) in respect of Taxes, as and to the extent provided in _Section 5.5_ (Tax Matters). 

  

 (b) Buyer shall have no liability under _Section 7.3(a)(i)_ for any claim for indemnification in respect of Seller Indemnified Parties Losses, (i) which individually (except that if the Losses are a series of related Losses, then in the aggregate) are less than $50,000 ( _provided_ that even if a Loss is less than $50,000, such Loss will be applied to and count for purposes of calculating the aggregate amount of Seller Indemnified Parties Losses under clause (ii) below) and (ii) until the aggregate amount of Seller Indemnified Parties Losses associated with indemnification claims under such Section clause (ii) further exceeds the Deductible Amount, after which Buyer shall be obligated for all the Seller Indemnified Parties Losses that are in excess of the Deductible Amount. The maximum liability of Buyer under _Section 7.3(a)(i)_ shall not exceed the Cap. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Deductible Amount and the Cap limitations shall not apply or be subject to Losses related to the Fundamental Reps of Buyer and clauses (ii) through (vi), inclusive, of _Section 7.3(a)_. 

  

 (c) Any payments made by or due from Buyer pursuant to the terms of this Agreement shall be free and clear of all Taxes whatsoever save only for any deductions or withholdings required by Law. If any deductions or withholdings are required by Law, or any payments made by or due from Buyer under this Agreement are liable for taxation (whether in the hands of Seller or its Affiliates), or would have been liable for taxation but for the utilization of any Tax Relief in respect of such liability, Buyer shall be liable under this Section 7.3(c) to pay to Seller, or the relevant 

   ##### 

  

 

Affiliate (as the case may be) to which the payments are made or due, such
further sums as will ensure that the net amount received by Seller or the
relevant Affiliate (as the case may be) will equal the full amount which
would have been received under the relevant provisions of this Agreement in
the absence of any such deductions, withholdings or taxation liabilities;
_provided_ ,  _however_ , that Buyer shall not be liable to pay any such
further sums to the extent that the payment of such further sums could have
been avoided by making the indemnity payment to a different Seller
Indemnified Party. Any additional amounts paid by Buyer in accordance with
this Section 7.3(c) shall be disregarded for the purposes of Section 7.3(a).
If any deduction or withholding is made from any payment under or in
connection with this Agreement, the Indemnifying Party will make the payment
to the relevant Taxing Authority of the amount deducted or withheld, and will
supply to the Indemnified Party, within 30 days of such payment being made,
an official receipt or other evidence of such payment and will give all
reasonable assistance to enable the Indemnified Party to claim a credit,
repayment or other relief in respect of the deduction or withholding as
promptly as possible. 

   

 Section 7.4 _Third-Party Claim Indemnification Procedures_. 

  

 (a) In the event that any written claim or demand for which an indemnifying party (an " _Indemnifying Party_ ") may have liability to any party hereunder that may be entitled to such indemnification hereunder (an " _Indemnified Party_ "), other than those relating to Taxes (which are the subject of _Section 5.5_, is asserted against or sought to be collected from any Indemnified Party by a third party (a " _Third-Party Claim_ "), such Indemnified Party shall promptly, but in any event within 30 days following such Indemnified Partys receipt of a Third-Party Claim, notify the Indemnifying Party in writing of such Third-Party Claim, describing in reasonable detail to the extent known the facts and circumstances with respect to the subject matter of such claim or demand, the amount or the estimated amount of damages sought thereunder, any other remedy sought thereunder, any relevant time constraints relating thereto and any other material details pertaining thereto (a " _Claim Notice_ ") ; _provided_ _that_ , with respect to the Third Party Claims set forth on Section 7.4 of the Seller Disclosure Letter, Buyer shall be deemed to have given such Claim Notice as of the Closing and Seller has elected to defend such Third Party Claims. The rights of any Indemnified Party to be indemnified hereunder shall not be adversely affected by its failure to timely give a Claim Notice with respect thereto except to the extent the Indemnifying Party is materially prejudiced thereby. The Indemnifying Party shall have 30 days (or such lesser number of days set forth in the Claim Notice as may be required by court proceeding in the event of a litigated matter) after receipt of the Claim Notice (the " _Notice Period_ ") to notify the Indemnified Party that it desires to defend the Indemnified Party against such Third-Party Claim. 

  

 (b) In the event that the Indemnifying Party notifies the Indemnified Party within the Notice Period that it desires to defend the Indemnified Party against a Third-Party Claim, (i) the Indemnifying Party shall have the right to defend the Indemnified Party by appropriate proceedings and shall have the sole power to direct and 

   ##### 

  

 

control such defense at its expense unless the Indemnified Party has notified
the Indemnifying Party in the Claim Notice that it has determined in good
faith that there is a reasonable probability that such Third-Party Claim may
adversely affect it or its Affiliates other than as a result of monetary
damages (including by way of adverse reputational effect) and (ii)
the Indemnified Party shall have the right, but not the obligation, to
participate in any such defense and to employ (at its expense subject to the
immediately following proviso) separate counsel of its choosing; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that if any actual or potential conflict of interest (including
one or more legal defenses or counterclaims is available to the Indemnified
Party that are different from or in addition to those available to the
Indemnifying Party) exists, the Indemnifying Party shall pay the Indemnified
Parties reasonable fees for one such counsel and local counsel, as
appropriate, for all of the Indemnified Parties collectively. The
Indemnifying Party shall not, without the prior written consent of the
Indemnified Party (which shall not be unreasonably withheld, delayed or
conditioned), settle, compromise or offer to settle or compromise, any Third-
Party Claim on a basis that would result in (i) the imposition of a
consent Order that would restrict the future activity or conduct of the
Indemnified Party or any of its Affiliates, or (ii) a finding or admission of
a violation of Law by the Indemnified Party. 

   

 (c) If the Indemnifying Party elects not to defend the Indemnified Party against a Third-Party Claim, (i) the Indemnified Party shall assume its own defense and the attorneys fees and other Losses incurred by the Indemnified Party in connection with such defense shall be the obligation of the Indemnifying Party to the extent the Indemnifying Party is obligated to indemnify the Indemnified Party against such Third-Party Claim and (ii) the Indemnified Party shall not settle any Third-Party Claim without the consent of the Indemnifying Party, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned. 

  

 (d) The Indemnified Party and the Indemnifying Party shall cooperate in order to ensure the proper and adequate defense of a Third-Party Claim, including by providing access to each others relevant business records and other documents, and employees. The Indemnified Party and the Indemnifying Party shall use reasonable best efforts to avoid production of confidential information (consistent with Applicable Local Law), and to cause all communications among employees, counsel and others representing any party to a Third-Party Claim to be made so as to preserve any applicable attorney-client (or solicitor-client) or work-product privileges. 

  

 (e) The foregoing indemnification procedures of this Section 7.4 shall not apply to regular payments made in fulfillment of the German Pension Plans Liabilities. Buyer shall procure that, each year in January, BCL shall render an account of any regular payments made in fulfillment of the German Pension Plans Liabilities and any payments received under any German Pension Plans Insurance Contract or any German Pension Plans Re-Insurance Contract since the Closing Date (in the first year) or since the last account was rendered (in any subsequent year). The rights of any Buyer Indemnified Party to be indemnified hereunder shall not adversely be affected by BCLs 

   ##### 

  

 

failure to timely render such account except to the extent the Seller is
materially prejudiced thereby. If the payments made exceed the payments
received Seller shall comply with its obligations under Section 7.2(a)(ix)
within 30 days from receipt of the account and proof of the individual
payments; otherwise, Buyer or BCL shall pay the balance to Seller within 30
days from receipt of the account by Seller. 

   

 Section 7.5 _Direct Claims_. If an Indemnified Party wishes to make a claim for indemnification hereunder for a Loss that does not result from a Third-Party Claim (a " _Direct Claim_ "), the Indemnified Party shall notify the Indemnifying Party in writing of such Direct Claim reasonably promptly, but in any event within 45 days, following the Indemnified Partys determination that the Indemnifying Party is or could be obligated to indemnify the Indemnified Party in respect thereof, and such notification shall include the amount or the estimated amount of damages sought thereunder to the extent then ascertainable, which estimate shall not be conclusive of the final amount of such Direct Claim, any other remedy sought thereunder, any relevant time constraints relating thereto and, to the extent practicable, any other material details pertaining thereto. The failure or delay by any Indemnified Party to timely notify the Indemnifying Party of a Direct Claim shall not impair such Indemnified Partys rights hereunder except to the extent that the Indemnifying Party is materially prejudiced by such failure or delay. 

  

 Section 7.6 _Punitive or Exemplary Damages, Etc_. In no event shall any party be liable for (and the term Losses shall exclude) (a) any punitive or exemplary damages or (b) any damages that are not either naturally resulting from or reasonably foreseeable (taking into consideration any special circumstances of the Indemnified Party of which the Indemnifying Party has Knowledge as of the date hereof) as a result of the underlying claim for breach or non-performance of this Agreement, unless, and solely to the extent that, in the case of the immediately preceding clauses (a) and (b), a party hereto becomes obligated to pay such damages to a third party that is not an Affiliate of any party. 

  

 Section 7.7 _Adjustments to Losses; Insurance_. 

  

 (a) In calculating the amount of any Loss, the proceeds actually received (net of costs) by the Indemnified Party or any of its Affiliates under any insurance policy or pursuant to any claim, recovery, settlement or payment by or against any other Person in each case relating to such Loss shall be deducted. In the event that an Indemnified Party has any rights against a third party with respect to any occurrence, claim or loss that results in a payment by an Indemnifying Party under this _ARTICLE VII_ , such Indemnifying Party shall be subrogated to such rights to the extent of such payment. Without limiting the generality or effect of any other provision hereof, each Indemnified Party and Indemnifying Party shall duly execute upon request all instruments reasonably necessary to evidence and perfect the subrogation rights detailed herein, and otherwise cooperate in the prosecution of such claims. 

  

 (b) _Taxes_. If any actual Tax benefit arises for an Indemnified Party from the incurrence of any Loss or any indemnification payment pursuant to _Section 5.5_ 

   ##### 

  

 

or this _ARTICLE VII_ (including any increase in such payment pursuant to
_Section 7.2(c)_ or _Section 7.3(c)_) to an Indemnified Party with respect
to such Loss, the amount of such indemnification payment shall be decreased
by an amount equal to such actual Tax benefit, and, if such actual Tax
benefit is actually realized by the Indemnified Party after the date of such
indemnification payment, such Indemnified Party shall pay or cause to be paid
to the Indemnifying Party an amount equal to such actual Tax benefit. For
purposes of this _Section 7.7(b)_ , an "actual Tax benefit" means an amount
by which the Tax liability of the Indemnified Party (or group of Persons
including the Indemnified Party) is actually reduced, as reflected by
an actual reduction in cash Taxes paid, an actual increase in cash Tax
refunds received, or the utilization of Tax credits, deductions or offsets
that actually reduces Taxes, as a direct result of such Loss, with such
actual Tax benefit realized with respect to a Tax year that is no later than
the third Tax year after the Tax year in which such indemnification payment
was made. Where an Indemnified Party has other losses, deductions, credits or
items available to it, the determination of any Tax benefit shall be
calculated by comparing (i) the Tax liability of the Indemnified Party (or
group of Persons including the Indemnified Party), computed without regard
to any losses, deductions, credits or items relating to the Loss, to (ii) the
Tax liability of the Indemnified Party (or group of Persons including the
Indemnified Party), computed after taking into account any losses,
deductions, credits or items relating to the Loss. In the event that
there should be a final, non-appealable determination disallowing the Tax
benefit, the Indemnifying Party shall be liable to refund to the Indemnified
Party the amount of any related reduction previously allowed or payments
previously made to the Indemnifying Party pursuant to this _Section 7.7(b)_.
The amount, if any, of any actual Tax benefit, and the amount of any
related reduction, shall be determined in good faith by the Indemnified
Party. This _Section 7.7(b)_ shall not be construed to require the
Indemnified Party to make available its Tax returns (or any other information
relating to its Taxes which it deems confidential) to the Indemnifying Party
or any other Person. 

   

 (c) If an Indemnified Party recovers an amount from a third party in respect of a Loss that is the subject of indemnification hereunder after all or a portion of such Loss has been paid by an Indemnifying Party pursuant to this _ARTICLE VII_ , the Indemnified Party shall promptly remit such amount to the Indemnifying Party. An Indemnified Party shall use reasonable endeavors to make any such recovery to which it is entitled. 

  

 Section 7.8 _Characterization of Indemnification Payments_. All payments made by an Indemnifying Party to an Indemnified Party in respect of any claim pursuant to _Section 7.2_ or _Section 7.3_ shall be treated as adjustments to the Purchase Price for Tax purposes, to the extent permitted by Applicable Local Law. 

  

 Section 7.9 _Mitigation_. Each Indemnified Party shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to mitigate any indemnifiable Loss. 

  

 Section 7.10 _Remedies_. Except in the case of fraud or willful misconduct and except for claims pursuant to _Section 5.10_, _Section 5.11(c)_ and _Section 5.15_, the rights 

   ##### 

  

 

and remedies of Seller and Buyer under this _ARTICLE VII_ are exclusive and in
lieu of any and all other rights and remedies that Seller and Buyer may have
under this Agreement, or otherwise against each other with respect to the
Transaction with respect to any breach of any representation or warranty, or
any failure to perform any covenant or agreement set forth in this Agreement,
other than _Section 9.8_, and Buyer and Seller each expressly waives any and
all other rights, remedies and causes of action it or its Affiliates may have
against the other party or its Affiliates now or in the future under any Law
with respect to the subject matter hereof. 

   

 _ARTICLE VIII_

 (c) by either Buyer or Seller, by giving written notice of such termination to the other party, if the Closing shall not have occurred on or prior to September 15, 2011 (or, in the event Seller elects to defer the Closing Date as contemplated by _Section 2.7_, December 15, 2011), so long as the notifying party is not in material breach of its obligations under this Agreement.

   ##### 

  

 

against whom the waiver is to be effective. No failure or delay by any party

and not exclusive of any rights or remedies provided by Law except as
otherwise provided in _ARTICLE VII_ hereof. 

   

 Section 9.3 _No Assignment or Benefit to Third Parties_.

 Section 9.5 _Public Disclosure_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, except as may be required to comply with the requirements of any Applicable Local Law and the rules and regulations of any competent regulatory authority or stock exchange upon which the securities of one of the parties is listed, from and after the date hereof, no press release or similar public announcement, or communication or disclosure of the terms of this Agreement shall be made or caused to be made relating to this Agreement, or consummation of the Transaction or thereby unless specifically approved in writing in advance by both parties hereto (which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned). 

  

 Section 9.6 _Expenses_. 

  

 (a) Except as otherwise expressly provided in this Agreement, whether or not the transactions contemplated by this Agreement are consummated, all costs and expenses incurred in connection with this Agreement and the consummation of the Transaction shall be borne by the party incurring such costs and expenses.

THE AGREEMENT SHALL BE GOVERNED BY AND CONSTRUED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE LAWS OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK WITHOUT REGARD TO PRINCIPLES OF CONFLICTS OF LAW. Each party hereto agrees that it shall bring any action or proceeding in respect of any claim arising out of or related to this Agreement, the Transactions or the Ancillary Agreements, exclusively in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York or any New York State court sitting in New York County (the " _Chosen Courts_ "), and solely in connection with claims arising under this Agreement or the Transactions (i) irrevocably submits to the exclusive jurisdiction of the Chosen Courts, (ii) waives any objection to laying venue in any such action or proceeding in the Chosen Courts, (iii) waives any objection that the Chosen Courts are an inconvenient forum or do not have jurisdiction over any party hereto and (iv) agrees that service of process upon such party in any such action or proceeding shall be effective if notice is given in accordance with _Section 9.1_. Each party hereto irrevocably waives any and all right to trial by jury in any legal proceeding arising out of or relating to this Agreement or the consummation of the Transaction. 

  

 Section 9.8 _Specific Performance_.

Accordingly, the parties hereto agree that, in addition to other remedies, each of the parties shall be entitled to specific performance without the necessity of proving the inadequacy of monetary damages as a remedy and to obtain injunctive relief against any such breaches or threatened breaches of this Agreement.

   ##### 

  

 

application of such provision to other Persons or circumstances shall not be
affected by such invalidity or unenforceability, nor shall such invalidity or
unenforceability affect the validity or enforceability of such provision, or
the application thereof, in any other jurisdiction.
