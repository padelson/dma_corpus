**MERGER  AGREEMENT**

 

 

This  Merger Agreement, dated August 7, 2007 (the " _Agreement_ "), is by and
among  Ecolab Inc., a Delaware corporation (" _Parent_ "), Magic Acquisition
Inc., a  Georgia corporation and wholly-owned Subsidiary of Parent (" _Merger
Sub_ "),  and Microtek Medical Holdings, Inc., a Georgia corporation (the "
_Company_ ").

 

 

**RECITALS**

 

 

**A.** The  respective boards of directors of Parent, Merger Sub and the
Company have  approved this Agreement and the merger of Merger Sub with and
into the Company  (the " _Merger_ ") upon the terms and subject to the
conditions set forth in  this Agreement and in accordance with the Georgia
Business Corporation Code  (the " _GBCC_ ").

 

 

**B.** Capitalized  terms used in this Agreement will have the meanings
specified in _Exhibit  A_.

 

 

In  consideration of the representations, warranties, covenants and
agreements  contained herein, and intending to be legally bound, the parties
agree as  follows:

 

 

**Section  1**

 

 

**The  Merger**

 

 

1.1 _The  Merger_. Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement,
at  the Effective Time, Merger Sub will be merged with and into the Company
in  accordance with the provisions of the GBCC, whereupon the separate
corporate  existence of Merger Sub will cease and the Company will continue
as the  surviving corporation (the " _Surviving Corporation_ ").

 

 

1.2 _Closing;  Effective Time_.

 

 

(a) The  closing of the Merger (the " _Closing_ ") will take place at the
offices of  Arnall Golden Gregory LLP **,** 171 17th Street NW - Suite
2100,  Atlanta, GA 30363, at 10:00 a.m. (Atlanta, Georgia time) on a date to
be agreed  between Parent and the Company, which date will be not later than
the second  Business Day after the conditions set forth in Section 6 have
been satisfied  or,  to the extent permitted by applicable Law, waived
(other than those conditions  which by their terms are to be satisfied at the
Closing, but subject to the  satisfaction or waiver of those conditions), or
at such other place and on  such  other date as Parent and the Company may
agree in writing. The date  on which the Closing occurs is referred to herein
as the " _Closing Date_." 

 

 

(b) As  soon  as practicable after the Closing, Parent and Merger Sub will
file, or cause  to  be filed, with the Secretary of State of the State of
Georgia, a certificate  of  merger for the Merger (the " _Certificate of
Merger_ "), which certificate  will be in the form required by and executed
in accordance with the applicable  provisions of the GBCC and in form and
substance acceptable to  Parent. The Merger will become effective at the time
the filing is  made or, if agreed to between Parent and the Company, at such
later time or  date  as is set forth in the certificate of merger (the "
_Effective  Time_ ").

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

1.3 _Effects  of the Merger_. The Merger will have the effects set forth in
the  applicable provisions of the GBCC.

 

 

1.4 _Articles  of Incorporation and Bylaws_. At the Effective Time, subject
to  complying with Section 5.8, (a) the articles of  incorporation of the
Surviving Corporation will be amended and restated in  their  entirety such
that they are identical to the articles of incorporation of Merger  Sub as in
effect immediately prior to the Effective Time, until amended in  accordance
with the articles of incorporation and the GBCC (except that Article  I
thereof will be amended in its entirety to read as follows: "The name of
this  corporation is Microtek Medical Holdings, Inc."), and (b) the bylaws of
the Surviving  Corporation will be amended and restated in their entirety
such that they are  identical to the bylaws of Merger Sub as in effect
immediately prior to the  Effective Time, until amended in accordance with
the bylaws, the Surviving  Corporation's articles of incorporation and the
GBCC.

 

 

1.5 _Directors  and Officers of the Surviving Corporation_. Merger Sub's
directors  immediately prior to the Effective Time will be the Surviving
Corporation's  directors until their respective successors are duly elected
and qualified  or  appointed or until their earlier death, resignation or
removal in accordance  with the articles of incorporation and the bylaws of
the Surviving  Corporation. Merger Sub's officers immediately prior to the
Effective  Time will be the Surviving Corporation's officers until their
respective  successors are duly elected and qualified or appointed or until
their earlier  death, resignation or removal in accordance with the articles
of incorporation  and the bylaws of the Surviving Corporation.

 

 

1.6 _Subsequent  Actions_. If at any time after the Effective Time the
Surviving  Corporation determines, in its sole discretion, that any actions
are necessary  or desirable to vest, perfect or confirm of record or
otherwise in the Surviving  Corporation its right, title or interest in, to
or under any of the rights,  properties or assets of either the Company or
Merger Sub acquired or to be  acquired by the Surviving Corporation as a
result of, or in connection with,  the  Merger or otherwise to carry out
this Agreement, then the Surviving  Corporation's officers and directors will
be authorized to take all actions  which may be necessary or desirable to
vest all right, title or interest in,  to  and under such rights, properties
or assets in the Surviving Corporation or  otherwise to carry out this
Agreement.

 

 

**Section  2**

 

 

**Conversion  of Shares**

 

 

2.1 _Conversion  of Shares_.

 

 

(a) At  the  Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any further
action on the  part of the Company, Parent or Merger Sub, or any holder of
their respective  shares of capital stock:

 

 

(i) Each  share of Company Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately
prior to the  Effective Time (other than shares of Company Common Stock to be
canceled under  Section 2.1(a)(iii) and any Dissenting Shares), together with
the associated  Rights, will be converted automatically into the right to
receive $6.30 in  cash  (the " _Merger Consideration_ "), without interest 
thereon.

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

2  

 

 

 

 

 

 

(ii) Each  share of capital stock of Merger Sub issued and outstanding
immediately prior  to  the Effective Time will be converted into one fully
paid and nonassessable  common share, no par value, of the Surviving
Corporation.

 

 

(iii) Each  share of Company Common Stock, together with the associated
Rights, issued  and  outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time and
directly held by an  Acquired Company, Parent or Merger Sub (other than those
held by the Company  in  a fiduciary or representative capacity) will be
canceled and extinguished and  no  payment will be made with respect
thereto. Except where the context  otherwise requires, all references
hereinafter to the shares of Company Common  Stock will be deemed to include
the associated Rights.

 

 

(b) If,  after  the date of this Agreement and at or prior to the Effective
Time, the  outstanding shares of Company Common Stock are changed into a
different number  of shares by reason of any reclassification,
recapitalization, split-up, stock  split, subdivision, combination or
exchange of shares or readjustment, or any  dividend payable in shares or
other securities is declared thereon or rights  issued in respect thereof
with a record date within that period, or any similar  event occurs, then the
Merger Consideration will be proportionately and  appropriately adjusted to
reflect the event.

 

 

(c) From  and  after the Effective Time, all shares of Company Common Stock
converted under  Section 2.1(a)(i) will no longer be outstanding and will
automatically be  cancelled and retired, and each holder of shares of Company
Common Stock so  converted will cease to have any rights with respect
thereto, except the right  to receive the Merger Consideration (without
interest thereon) upon the  surrender of shares in accordance with Section
2.2.

 

 

2.2 _Paying  Agent_.

 

 

(a) Prior  to  the Effective Time, Parent will designate a bank or trust
company reasonably  acceptable to the Company to act as a paying agent under
this Agreement (the  " _Paying Agent_ "). As soon as reasonably practicable
after the  Effective Time, Parent will deposit or cause to be deposited with
the Paying  Agent, for the benefit of the holders of shares of Company Common
Stock, an  amount of cash sufficient to deliver to the holders thereof the
Merger  Consideration required to be paid under Section 2.1. All cash 
deposited with the Paying Agent is referred to in this Agreement as the "
_Fund_."

 

 

(b) As  soon  as reasonably practicable after the Effective Time, Parent
will instruct the  Paying Agent to mail to each Person who was, as of the
Effective Time, a holder  of shares of Company Common Stock, a letter of
transmittal and instructions  in  customary form and containing such
provisions as Parent may reasonably specify  (including a provision
confirming that delivery will be effected, and risk  of  loss and title to
shares of Company Common Stock will pass, only upon proper  surrender of
shares to the Paying Agent). Upon proper delivery to the  Paying Agent of (i)
certificates (in the case of shares of Company Common Stock  represented by
certificates) together with the associated letter of transmittal,  duly
executed and completed in accordance with the instructions thereto or  (ii) 
an "agent's message" (in the case of shares of Company Common Stock not 
represented by certificates) or such other evidence, if any, of transfer as 
the  Paying Agent may reasonably request, the holder of the certificates or 
uncertificated shares will be entitled to receive in exchange therefor the 
Merger Consideration to which the holder is entitled under this Section  2.
Until surrendered as provided in this Section 2.2(b), each share  of Company
Common Stock will be deemed after the Effective Time to represent  only the
right to receive upon surrender the Merger Consideration.

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

3  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

(c) If  any  portion of the Merger Consideration is to be paid to a Person
other than the  Person in whose name the shares of Company Common Stock is
registered, it will  be a condition to the payment that:

 

 

(i) (1)  in  the case of certificated shares, the certificate is properly
endorsed or is  otherwise in proper form for transfer and (2) in the case of
uncertificated  shares, the shares are properly transferred; and

 

 

(ii) the  Person requesting the payment either (1) pays to the Paying Agent
any transfer  or other Taxes required as a result of the payment to a Person
other than the  registered holder of the shares or (2) establish to the
Paying Agent's  satisfaction that all transfer or other Taxes have been paid
or are not payable. 

 

 

(d) At  the  Effective Time, the Company's share transfer books will be
closed, and there  will be no further registration of transfers on the
Surviving Corporation's  share transfer books of the shares of Company Common
Stock that were outstanding  immediately prior to the Effective Time. If,
after the Effective  Time, any shares of Company Common Stock are presented
to the Surviving  Corporation for transfer, the shares will be cancelled
against delivery of  the  Merger Consideration to the holder thereof as
provided in this Section 2.2. 

 

 

(e) If  any  certificate representing shares of Company Common Stock has
been lost, stolen  or  destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that
fact by the Person claiming  that the certificate to be lost, stolen or
destroyed and, if required by Parent,  the posting by that Person of a bond
in such reasonable amount as Parent may  direct as indemnity against any
claim that may be made against it with respect  to the certificate, the
Paying Agent will deliver in exchange for the lost,  stolen or destroyed
certificate the Merger Consideration under this Section  2.

 

 

(f) Each  of  Parent and the Surviving Corporation will be entitled to
deduct and withhold  from the consideration otherwise payable under this
Section 2 such amounts  as it  is required to deduct and withhold with
respect to the payment under the Code  or  any other applicable Law relating
to the payment of Taxes. To the  extent that amounts are so withheld and paid
over to the appropriate Taxing  Authority by Parent or the Surviving
Corporation, the withheld amounts will  be  treated for all purposes of this
Agreement as having been paid to the holder  of  shares of Company Common
Stock in respect of which the deduction and withholding  was made by Parent
or the Surviving Corporation.

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

4  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

2.3 _Investment  and Termination of Fund_.

 

 

(a) The  Paying Agent will invest the Fund as directed by Parent. Any
interest  and other income resulting from the investments will be paid to and
be income  of  Parent.

 

 

(b) Any  portion of the Fund (including earnings thereon) which remains
undistributed  to  the holders of any shares of Company Common Stock for 12
months after the  Effective Time will be delivered to Parent, upon demand,
and any holder of  shares of Company Common Stock who has not theretofore
complied with this  Section 2 will thereafter look only to Parent for payment
of the holder's claim  to the Merger Consideration in accordance with this
Section 2.

 

 

(c) None  of  Parent, Merger Sub, the Company, the Surviving Corporation or
the Paying Agent  will be liable to any Person in respect of any portion of
the Fund which is  properly delivered to a public official under any
applicable abandoned property,  escheat or similar Law. If any shares of
Company Common Stock are not  surrendered prior to the third anniversary of
the Effective Time (or immediately  prior to such earlier date on which any
Merger Consideration would otherwise  escheat to or become the property of
any Authority), then such Merger  Consideration will, to the extent permitted
by applicable Law, become the  property of Parent, free and clear of all
claims or interests of any Person  previously entitled thereto.

 

 

2.4 _Dissenting  Shares_. __

 

 

(a) Notwithstanding  anything in this Agreement to the contrary, shares of
Company Common Stock  that  are outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time and the holders of  which  have perfected and not withdrawn
or lost their dissenters' rights in accordance  with Sections 14-2-1301
through 14-2-1332 of the GBCC (" _Dissenting  Shares_ ") will be paid for by
Parent in accordance with Sections 14-2-1301  through 14-2-1332 of the GBCC,
except that if any holder fails to perfect or  otherwise waives, withdraws or
loses the right to receive payment of the fair  value of its shares of
Company Common Stock under Sections 14-2-1301 through  14-2-1332 of the GBCC,
the right of that holder to be paid the fair value of  its  shares of
Company Common Stock will cease and the subject shares will be deemed 
converted as of the Effective Time into the right to receive the Merger 
Consideration as provided in this Section 2.

 

 

(b) The  Company will give Parent (i) prompt notice of any written demands
for fair  value  received by the Company, withdrawals of such demands, and
any other related  instruments served under Sections 14-2-1301 through
14-2-1332 of the GBCC and  received by the Company and (ii) the opportunity
to direct all negotiations  and  proceedings with respect to demands for
fair value under the  GBCC. The Company will not, except with the prior
written consent of  Parent, voluntarily make any payment with respect to any

2.5 _Company  Share Plans_.

 

 

(a) The  Company Board will take all action necessary such that, at the
Effective Time,  each option to purchase shares of Company Common Stock
outstanding under any  Company Share Plan (each, a " _Company Stock Option_
"), whether or not  vested or exercisable, will be canceled and converted
into the right to receive  an amount in cash equal to the product of (i) the
excess, if any, of the Merger  Consideration over the applicable exercise
price of the Company Stock Option  multiplied by (ii) the total number of
Company Common Shares subject to the  Company Stock Option (whether or not
vested or exercisable). As  promptly after the Effective Time as reasonably
practicable, the Parent will  pay  or cause to be paid the foregoing amount
to each holder of a Company Stock  Option.

 

 

(b) Each  Company Common Share outstanding as of the Effective Time which was
granted  under a Company Share Plan and which is subject to a risk of
forfeiture  (" _Company Restricted Shares_ ") will be deemed fully vested as
of the  Effective Time in accordance with the terms of the applicable plan
and, in  full  settlement thereof (net of applicable withholding in
accordance with the  Company's practices prior to the date of this
Agreement), will be converted into  the right to receive the Merger
Consideration in accordance with Section  2. To the extent that amounts are
withheld from the consideration  otherwise payable to holders of Company
Restricted Shares, the withheld amounts  will be treated for all purposes of
this Agreement as having been paid to the  holders in respect of which the
withholding was made.

 

 

(c) Prior  to  the Effective Time, the Company will (i) adopt such
resolutions or take such  other actions as may be required to effect the
foregoing provisions of this  Section 2.5, and (ii) take all steps necessary
to cause any dispositions of  shares of Company Common Stock or other
securities (including options and any  other derivative securities) resulting
from the Merger or the other transactions  contemplated by this Agreement by
each officer or director or the Company who  is  subject to the reporting
requirements of Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act  to be  exempt under Rule
16b-3 promulgated thereunder, with all such steps to be taken  in accordance
with the requirements of the Exchange Act.

 

 

(d) Effective  upon the date of this Agreement, the Company Board will adopt
appropriate  resolutions and take all other actions necessary and appropriate
to provide  each  participant's outstanding right to purchase shares of
Company Common Stock under  the Company\'s Employee Stock Purchase Plan (the
" _ESPP_ ") will terminate on  the day immediately prior to the day on which
the Effective Time occurs, except  that all amounts allocated to each
participant's account under the ESPP as of  such date will thereupon be used
to purchase from the Company whole shares  of  Company Common Stock at the
applicable price determined under the terms of  the  ESPP for then
outstanding offering periods using such date as the final purchase  date for
each such offering period, and the ESPP will terminate immediately  following
the purchase of Company Common Stock on the date prior to the day  on  which
the Effective Time occurs. The Company Board will not take any  action that
would allow any Company Personnel to begin participating in the  ESPP  or
that would permit any existing participant to increase his or her 
participation in the ESPP.

Agreement. The Company and the  Company Board have taken all action required
by Law, the Company's Governing  Documents and otherwise to authorize the
Company's execution, delivery and  performance of this Agreement, subject to
receipt of the Required Shareholder  Vote. The Company has duly and validly
executed and delivered this  Agreement and, assuming the due authorization,
execution and delivery of this  Agreement by Parent and Merger Sub, this
Agreement constitutes the legal and  valid binding obligation of the Company

creditors' rights generally and to general  principles of equity (regardless
of whether enforceability is considered in  a  proceeding in equity or at
law).

execution of  this  Agreement, duly and unanimously adopted resolutions (i)
approving and declaring  advisable this Agreement and the transaction
contemplated hereby (which  approvals were made in accordance with the GBCC);
(ii) determining that the  terms of the Merger are advisable and in the best
interests of the Company  and  its shareholders; and (iii) recommending that

any third party under any  standstill or similar agreement.

 

 

(e) Except  as  set forth in _Section_ _3.3(e)_ _of the Company Disclosure

transactions contemplated by this Agreement or exercise any remedy or obtain 
any relief under, any applicable Law or Order; or (v) cause the suspension 
or  revocation of any material Permit necessary for any Acquired Company to
conduct  its business as currently conducted, except in the case of clauses
(ii) through  (iv), any consequences that would not, individually or in the
aggregate,  reasonably be expected to (x) be material to the Acquired
Companies taken  as a whole, (y) impair in any material respect the Company's
ability to perform  its obligations under this Agreement or (z) prevent or
materially delay the  completion of the Merger or the other transactions

_Takeover Statute_ _"_ )  or any anti-takeover provision in the Company\'s
articles of incorporation and  bylaws is, or at the Effective Time will be,
applicable to the transactions  contemplated by this Agreement. Based in part
on the representations  of Parent and Merger Sub set forth in Section 4, the
Company Board has taken  or  caused to be taken all action so that neither
Parent nor Merger Sub will be  prohibited from entering into a "business
combination" with the Company or any  of its Affiliates as an "interested
shareholder" (in each case as such term is  used in Sections 14-2-1110 or
14-2-1131 of the GBCC, as applicable) as a result  of the execution of this
Agreement or the consummation of the transactions  contemplated by this
Agreement.

 

 

(g) The  Company Board has taken all necessary action to render the First
Amended and  Restated Shareholder Protection Rights Agreement, dated as of
December 20,  2006,  between the Company and Computershare Investor
Services, LLC as Rights Agent  (the " _Rights Agreement_ "), inapplicable to
the transactions contemplated  by this Agreement. The Company has taken all
necessary action with  respect to all of the outstanding Rights so that (i)
none of Parent or any  of  its Affiliates or Associates (each as defined in
the Rights Agreement) will  be  deemed an Acquiring Person (as defined in
the Rights Agreement), none of a  Stock  Acquisition Date, Flip-in Date,
Flip-Over Transaction or Event or Separation  Time (each as defined in the
Rights Agreement) will occur, and the rights issued  or issuable pursuant to
the Rights Agreement (the " _Rights_ ") will not  separate from the shares of
Common Stock, in each case as a result of the  execution of this Agreement or
the consummation of the transactions contemplated  by this Agreement; (ii)
the holders of the Rights will have no rights under  the  Rights or the
Rights Agreement in connection with the execution of this  Agreement or the
consummation of the transactions contemplated by this  Agreement; and (iii)
upon Closing, all Rights under the Rights Agreement will  expire.

material respect  the  Company's ability to perform its obligations under
this Agreement or (iii)  prevent or materially delay the completion of the
Merger or the other  transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

Companies for all Taxable periods  and portions thereof through the date of

3.12 _Employment  Matters._

 

 

(a) Since  December 31, 2003, no Acquired Company has materially Breached any

or practices, or any other  labor-related agreements or arrangements that
pertain to any of the employees  of  an Acquired Company; and (iii) no

Company Plans are in material compliance with, to the extent applicable,
ERISA  and the Code, and the rules and regulations promulgated  thereunder.
Each Company Plan that is subject to ERISA (the " _ERISA  Plans_ ") and that
is also an "employee pension benefit plan" within the  meaning of section
3(2) of ERISA intended to be qualified under Section 401(a)  of the Code has
received a favorable determination letter from the IRS or has  applied to the
IRS for such favorable determination letter within the applicable  remedial
amendment period under Section 401(b) of the Code (or, alternatively,  if
such plan is maintained pursuant to the adoption of a master or prototype 
plan document, the IRS has issued an opinion letter to the effect that the 
form  of the master or prototype plan document is acceptable for the
implementation  of  a qualified retirement plan), and to the Company's
knowledge there are no  circumstances likely to result in the loss of the
qualification of such plan  under Section 401(a) of the Code. There is no
pending or, to the  Company's knowledge, threatened Proceeding relating to
any Company Plan other  than ordinary and usual claims for benefits
thereunder. To the  Company's knowledge, neither the Company nor any ERISA
Affiliate has engaged in  a transaction with respect to any ERISA Plan that,
assuming the taxable period  of such transaction expired as of the date of
this Agreement, would subject  Company or any ERISA Affiliate to a Tax or
penalty imposed by either Section  4975 of the Code or Section 502(i) of
ERISA.

bargaining agreement, except  as  required by Law.

 

 

(e) Except  as  set forth in _Section_ _3.13(e)_ _of the Company
Disclosure  Schedule_ , neither the execution of this Agreement, nor
shareholder approval  of this Agreement, nor the consummation of the
transactions contemplated by  this  Agreement will (i) entitle any Company
Personnel to severance pay or any  increase in severance pay upon any
termination of employment after the date  of  this Agreement; (ii)
accelerate the time of payment or vesting or result in  any  payment or
funding (through a grantor trust or otherwise) of compensation or  benefits
under, increase the amount payable or result in any other material 
obligation pursuant to, any of the Company Plans; or (iii) limit or restrict 
the  right of the Company, or, after the consummation of the transactions 
contemplated by this Agreement, the Parent, to merge, amend or terminate any 
of  the Company Plans.

Disclosure  Schedule_ , all material Company Non-U.S. Plans, each of which is
listed in  _Section_ _3.13(f)_ _of the Company Disclosure Schedule_ , are
in  material compliance with all applicable Laws. The Company and the  ERISA
Affiliates have no unfunded Liabilities with respect to any Company  Non-U.S.
Plans that are not set forth in the consolidated balance sheets  included in
or incorporated by reference into the Company SEC  Documents. There is no
pending or, to the Company's knowledge,  threatened Proceeding relating to
any Company Non-U.S. Plans other than ordinary  and usual claims for benefits

Disclosure Schedule_ , no Acquired Company has made any payments, is
obligated  to make any payments or is a party to any Contract covering any
Person that  could obligate it to make an excess parachute payment or any
other payment  that  is not fully deductible by the Acquired Company under
Section 162(m) or Section  280G of the Code.

has made  available to Parent correct and complete copies of each Contract
relating to  the  Leased Real Property (including any and all modifications,
supplements and  amendments thereto and any and all renewals or extensions
thereof, each a " _Lease_ "). Each Lease is the legal, valid, binding, and 
enforceable obligation of the Acquired Company that is lessee thereunder,
and,  to the Company's knowledge, the Lease is in full force and effect and
the  binding obligation of the other parties thereto and will continue to be
the  legal, valid, binding, and enforceable obligation of the applicable
Acquired  Company following the Closing. No Acquired Company has received
any  written notice that it is in material Breach under any Lease (which
Breach  has  not been cured), and to the Company's knowledge no Acquired
Company or any other  party to such Lease is in material Breach under any
such Lease, and, subject  to  receipt of the Consents listed in _Section_
_3.3(e)_ _of the Company  Disclosure Schedule_ , no event has occurred,
which, after the giving of  notice, with lapse of time, or otherwise, would
constitute a material Breach  by  an Acquired Company or, to the Company's

licensed to do  business as a foreign entity in good standing in each
jurisdiction where the  nature of its business or the ownership, leasing or
operation of its assets  requires such licensing or qualification, except
where the failure to be so  qualified or licensed would not reasonably be
expected to have a Parent Material  Adverse Effect. Merger Sub was formed
solely for the purpose of  engaging in the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated by this  Agreement, has engaged in no other business activities
and has conducted its  operations only as contemplated hereby.

 

 

(c) Parent  has furnished to the Company correct and complete copies of the

required by Law, the  Governing Documents of Parent and Merger Sub and
otherwise to authorize the  execution, delivery and performance of this
Agreement by Parent and Merger  Sub. Parent and Merger Sub have duly and

the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or  exercise any remedy or
obtain any relief under, any Law or Order applicable  to  Parent or Merger
Sub, except in the case of clauses (ii)-(iv), any such  consequences that
would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be  expected to (x)
be material to Parent and its Subsidiaries taken as a whole;  (y)  impair in
any material respect Parent's or Merger Sub's ability to perform their 
respective obligations under this Agreement; or (z) prevent or materially
delay  the completion of the Merger or the other transactions contemplated by
this  Agreement.

Company's  shareholders and at the time of the Shareholder Meeting, contain
any untrue  statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact
required to  be  stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements
therein, in light  of  the circumstances under which they are made, not

that the Company did  not  initiate, solicit or knowingly facilitate or
encourage, then the Company and  its  Representatives may furnish
information to and participate in discussions with  the Person (and its
Affiliates and their respective Representatives) making  the  Takeover

the time it is  provided to the Person; and

 

 

(iii) the  Company Board determines in good faith by resolution duly adopted
after  consultation with its outside legal counsel and a financial advisor
of  nationally recognized reputation that (1) the failure to furnish the
information  or participate in the discussions would reasonably be expected

shareholders under the GBCC and  (2) the Takeover Proposal is or could
reasonably be expected to lead to a  Superior Proposal.

 

 

(c) As  promptly as practicable (and in any event within two Business Days)

Proposal, including any changes to the terms and conditions  thereof, and
will promptly provide Parent with copies of all such Takeover  Proposals (and
modifications thereof) and related agreements, draft agreements  and

(i) the  Superior Proposal did not result from a material Breach of this
Section  5.2;

 

 

(ii) the  Company Board determines in good faith by resolution duly adopted
after  consultation with its outside legal counsel, that the failure to make
a Change  in Recommendation would reasonably be expected to violate its
fiduciary duties  to the Company's shareholders under the GBCC;

 

 

(iii) the  Company Board has first provided prior written notice to Parent
that it is  prepared to make a Change in Recommendation in response to the
Superior  Proposal, and with such notice or by prior communication (1)

material terms and  conditions of the Superior Proposal, and (3) provides the

receives the  foregoing written notice, and Parent does not within that
period propose to  amend this Agreement to provide for terms which the
Company Board determines  in  good faith by resolution duly adopted after
consultation with a financial  advisor of nationally recognized reputation,
is at least as favorable to the  Company's shareholders as the Superior
Proposal.

 

 

(f) Nothing  contained in Section 5.2(d) will prohibit the Company or the
Company Board  from  (i) complying with Rule 14e-2 promulgated under the
Exchange Act in respect  of  any Takeover Proposal, (ii) making any
disclosure to the Company's shareholders  if the Company Board determines in
good faith by resolution duly adopted after  consultation with its outside
counsel, that the failure to make the disclosure  would reasonably be
expected to result in a Breach of its fiduciary duties  to  the Company's
shareholders under the GBCC, or (iii) taking any action or making  any
disclosure required by applicable Law. However, the Company Board  may not,
except as expressly permitted by Section 5.2(e), effect a Change in

recommend, a Takeover Proposal.

under which they are made,  not  misleading, the party which discovers such

all  lawful action and use its commercially reasonable efforts to duly call,
give  notice of, convene and hold a meeting of the shareholders of the

respect to the  approval or adoption of this Agreement. The Company will

5.6 _Reasonable  Efforts; Filings; Notification_.

 

 

(a) Upon  the  terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this
Agreement, each of the  parties will use all commercially reasonable efforts
to take, or cause to be  taken, all actions, and to do, or cause to be done,
and to assist and cooperate  with the other parties in doing, all things
necessary, proper or advisable  to  complete and make effective, in the most
expeditious manner practicable, the  Merger and the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, including  the  use of all commercially
reasonable efforts to (i) cause the conditions to  Closing to be satisfied as
promptly as practicable; (ii) obtain all necessary  Consents from, and submit
all necessary notices, registrations and filings  with,  Authorities and
other Third Parties; (iii) subject to Section 5.12 (which will  control over
the terms of this clause (iii)), defend against any Proceedings  or  other
actions challenging this Agreement or the completion of the Merger and  the 
other transactions contemplated hereby (including seeking to have vacated or 
reversed any Order issued by an Authority); and (iv) execute and deliver
such  additional instruments as may be necessary to complete the
transactions  contemplated by, and to fully carry out the purposes of, this 
Agreement. If any state takeover statute or similar Law is or becomes 
applicable to this Agreement, the Merger or any of the other transactions 
contemplated by this Agreement, the Company and the Company Board will use 
all  commercially reasonable efforts to ensure that the Merger and the
other  transactions contemplated by this Agreement are completed as promptly
as  practicable on the terms contemplated by this Agreement and otherwise
to  minimize the effect of such Law on this Agreement, the Merger and the
other  transactions contemplated hereby.

 

 

(b) Without  limiting the generality of Section 5.6(a), each of the Company
and Parent will  (A) file with the FTC and the Antitrust Division of the
United States Department  of Justice (the " _Antitrust Division_ ") the
notification and report form  (the " _HSR Filing_ ") required under the HSR
Act and (B) duly make all  notifications and other filings required (together
with the HSR Filing, the  " _Antitrust Filings_ ") under any other applicable
competition, merger  control, antitrust or similar Law that the parties deem
advisable or  appropriate, in each case with respect to the transactions
contemplated by  this  Agreement and as promptly as practicable. The
Antitrust Filings will  be in substantial compliance with the requirements of
the HSR Act or other  Laws,  as applicable, and the parties will use all
commercially reasonable efforts  to  (i) cooperate with each other to the
extent reasonably necessary to prepare  and  make such filings and
notifications and, if requested, promptly amend or furnish  additional
information thereunder; (ii) respond promptly to all inquiries and  requests
received from an Authority in connection with such filings and 
notifications; and (iii) facilitate the earliest possible termination of all 
waiting periods and the earliest possible granting of all required Consents 
in  connection with such filings and notifications.

 

 

(c) In  furtherance, and not in limitation, of the parties' agreements in
this Section  5.6, if any objections are asserted under the HSR Act or any
other similar  Laws  concerning the Merger, or if any Proceeding is
instituted (or threatened to  be  instituted) by any Authority or Third
Party challenging any of the transactions  contemplated by this Agreement or
which would otherwise prohibit or materially  impair or materially delay the
completion of the Merger, then Parent and the  Company will each use all
commercially reasonable efforts to resolve any such  objections or suits so
as to permit completion of the  Merger. However, notwithstanding anything to
the contrary in this  Agreement, (i) the Company will not, without Parent's
prior written consent,  commit to any divestitures, licenses, hold separate
arrangements or similar  matters, including covenants affecting business
operating practices (or allow  any of the Company Subsidiaries to commit to
any divestitures, licenses, hold  separate arrangements or similar matters),
and the Company will commit to,  and  will use all commercially reasonable
efforts to effect (and will cause each  of  the Company Subsidiaries to
commit to and use all commercially reasonable  efforts to effect), any such
divestitures, licenses, hold separate arrangements  or similar matters as
Parent may request, but solely if such divestitures,  licenses, hold separate
arrangements or similar matters are contingent upon  completion of the
Merger; and (ii) neither Parent nor any of the Parent  Subsidiaries will be
required to agree (with respect to (1) Parent or the Parent  Subsidiaries or
(2) the Company or the Company Subsidiaries) to any  divestitures, licenses,
hold separate arrangements or similar matters, including  covenants affecting
business operating practices.

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

37  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

(d) Each  of  the Company and Parent will, subject to applicable Law and
except as prohibited  by any applicable representative of any applicable
Authority: (i) promptly  notify the other party of any written or oral
communication to that party from  the FTC, the Antitrust Division, any State
Attorney General or any other  Authority relating to this Agreement or the
Merger, and permit the other party  to review and discuss in advance any
proposed written or oral communication  to  any of the foregoing; (ii) not
agree to participate in any meeting or discussion  with any Authority in
respect of any filings, investigation or inquiry  concerning this Agreement
or the Merger unless it consults with the other party  in advance and, to the
extent permitted by such Authority, gives the other  party  the opportunity
to attend and participate thereat; and (iii) furnish the other  party with
copies of all correspondence, filings, and written communications  between
them and its Affiliates and their respective Representatives, on the  one 
hand, and any Authority or members or their respective staffs, on the other 
hand, with respect to this Agreement and the Merger, except that a party may 
designate certain documents or portions thereof as "outside antitrust
counsel  only."

 

 

5.7 _Public  Announcements_. The initial public announcement of this
Agreement  will be a joint press release in the form heretofore agreed
between the  parties. Thereafter, Parent and the Company will consult and 
cooperate with each other in good faith regarding any further press releases 
or  other public statements with respect to the transactions contemplated by
this  Agreement, except as may be required by applicable Law (including the
rules  and  regulations of the NYSE and NASDAQ), in which case the party
proposing to issue  such press release or other public statement will use all
reasonable efforts  to  give as much advance notice to the other party as
possible and to consult in  good faith with the other party before issuing
such press release or other  public statement.

 

 

5.8 _Indemnification  and Insurance_.

 

 

(a) Parent  and the Surviving Corporation jointly and severally agree that
all rights to  indemnification and advancement of expenses for acts or
omissions occurring  prior to the Effective Time (including acts or omissions
in connection with  this  Agreement and the consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby) now  existing in favor of the Company's current and
former directors and officers  (each an " _Indemnified Party_ ") as provided
in the Company's Governing  Documents, and in any indemnification agreements
with the Indemnified Parties,  will survive the Merger and will thereafter
continue in full force and effect  in  accordance with their terms. Parent
and the Surviving Corporation  jointly and severally will advance expenses to
and indemnify the Indemnified  Parties to the same extent as the Indemnified
Parties currently are entitled  to  advancement of expenses and
indemnification.

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

38  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

(b) Prior  to  the Effective Time, the Company will purchase the six year
extended reporting  period endorsement under the Company's existing
directors' and officers' liability insurance policy and the Company's
existing employee benefit plan  fiduciary liability insurance policy, which
endorsements provide six years  of  coverage with respect to claims arising
from facts or events that occurred  at or  prior to the Effective Time for
those persons who are currently covered by  such  policies on terms no less
favorable than the terms of such policies, except  that  the aggregate cost
of the endorsements may not, without the Parent's prior  written consent,
exceed 200% of the aggregate annual premiums for such  policies.

 

 

(c) The  provisions of this Section 5.8 are intended to be for the benefit
of, and will  be enforceable by, each of the Indemnified Parties and their
heirs and legal  representatives.

 

 

(d) The  rights of the Indemnified Parties and their heirs and legal
representatives  under this Section 5.8 are in addition to any rights the
Indemnified Parties  may  have under any of the Company's articles of
incorporation or bylaws, under any  indemnification agreement between the
Company and such Indemnified Person,  or  under any other applicable Laws.
From and after the Effective Time,  the Surviving Corporation's articles of
incorporation and bylaws will contain  provisions no less favorable with
respect to indemnification of, advancement  of  expenses for and exculpation
of the Indemnified Parties than the provisions  currently set forth in the
Company's articles of incorporation and  bylaws. Each indemnification
agreement between the Company and an  Indemnified Party as in effect on the
date hereof will survive the Merger and  continue in full force and effect in
accordance with its terms.

 

 

(e) The  obligations of Parent and the Surviving Corporation under this
Section 5.8  may  not be terminated or modified in a manner as to adversely
affect any Indemnified  Party to whom this Section 5.8 applies without the
consent of the affected  Indemnified Party. In the event that either Parent
or the Surviving  Corporation or any of their respective successors or
assigns (i) consolidates  with or merges into any other Person or (ii)
transfers all or a substantially  all of its properties or assets to any
Person, then and in each case, proper  provision will be made so that the
applicable successors and assigns or  transferees assume the obligations set
forth in this Section 5.8.

 

 

5.9 _Fees  and Expenses_. Except as otherwise provided in Section 7.2, all 
costs and expenses incurred in connection with this Agreement and the 
transactions contemplated by this Agreement will be paid by the party
incurring  such expense, whether or not the Merger is consummated.

relating to any material Taxes or any  waiver of the statute of limitations
for any such claim or assessment; (iii)  settle or compromise any material

material Tax Liability  or materially and adversely affect the Tax attributes
of an Acquired Company;  and (iii) provide Parent with copies of any income
Tax Return that an Acquired  Company is required to file or elects to file
prior to the Effective  Time.

 

 

(c) If  reasonably requested by Parent, the Company will, and will cause each
Company  Subsidiary to, deliver to Parent at the Closing such documentation
as is  reasonably necessary to make or permit to be made one or more
elections pursuant  to treasury regulation section 301.7701-3(c) (or any
other similar applicable  Law) to have a Company Subsidiary classified other

taxable period or portion  thereof ending on or prior to the Effective Time.

 

 

**5.11** _Benefits  and Employment_.

will, prior to the  Effective Time, amend each Company Plan and each Non-U.S.
Company Plan set  forth  in _Section_ _5.11_ _of the Company Disclosure
Schedule_ (the " _Old Plans_ ") to terminate such plan immediately prior  to
the Effective  Time and to terminate each group insurance policy and
administrative services  agreement related to such plan effective upon its
termination, subject to such  provisions relating to the payment of claims
incurred and contributions accrued  prior to the Effective Time. Any Company
Plan or Non-U.S. Company  Plan that is not an Old Plan will by operation of
law be assumed by Surviving  Corporation as of the Effective Date. Any
vacation time accrued under  the Company's vacation policy as of the
Effective Time will be carried over and  credited to the applicable Company
Personnel on and after the Effective  Time.

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

40  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

(c) For  purposes of satisfying the eligibility, participation and  vesting
requirements under the employee benefit plans of Parent and  its Affiliates

are similar or comparable to the Old Plans, (the " _New Plans_ "),  each
Company Personnel will receive credit for his or her service with the 
Company and its Affiliates before the Effective Time (including predecessor 
or  acquired entities or any other entities for which the Company and its
Affiliates  have given credit for prior service), to the same extent as such
Company  Personnel was entitled, before the Effective Time, to credit for
such service  under any similar or comparable Company Plans (except to the
extent such credit  would not have been taken into account under a New Plan
had it been service  for  Parent). Service with the Company will not be
required to be taken  into account in determining the benefits accrued or the
amount of employer  subsidy under any New Plan.

 

 

(d) As  of the  Effective Time, each Company Personnel will be eligible to
participate, without  any waiting period, in each New Plan, to the extent the
Company Personnel was  participant in the corresponding Old Plan immediately
prior to the Effective  Time.

pharmaceutical or  vision benefits to any Company Personnel, Parent will
cause

 

 

(i) all  pre-existing condition exclusions and actively-at-work requirements
of the  New  Plan to be waived for the Company Personnel and his or her
covered dependents  to  the extent that the exclusions and requirements
would not have applied to that  person under the corresponding Old Plan; and

 

 

(ii) any  eligible expenses incurred by the Company Personnel and his or her
covered  dependents during the portion of the plan year of the Old Plan
ending on the  date the Company Personnel's participation in the
corresponding New Plan begins  to be taken into account under such New Plan
for purposes of satisfying all  deductible, coinsurance and maximum out-of-
pocket requirements applicable to  the  Company Personnel and his or her
covered dependents for the applicable plan  year  as if those amounts had
been paid in accordance with the New Plan to the extent  that the eligible
expenses would have been so taken into account under the  corresponding Old
Plan for that plan year.

 

 

(f) Parent  will cause each New Plan providing health or dependent care
flexible spending  account benefits to any Company Personnel to take into
account for each Employee  as of the Effective Time, the elections, claims,
contributions and payments  made  with respect to such Company Personnel
under the corresponding Old Plan  providing health or dependent care spending
account benefits.

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

41  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

(g) Prior  to  the Effective Time, the compensation committee of the Company
Board will  determine, and may provide for the payment of (either at, prior
to or after  the  Effective Time), annual bonuses for the 2007 plan year
under the Company's  Annual Executive Performance Bonus Plan and the
Company's Pay for Performance  Bonus Plan (the " _Bonus Plans_ "), in each
case based solely upon applicable  performance for 2007 and calculated in
accordance with past practice and the  applicable bonus formulae communicated
prior to the date of this Agreement  to  the participants thereunder, except
that the performance determination may  be  made for a period of less than
the full calendar year (and annualized for the  full year) in the event the
Effective Time occurs prior to January 1, 2008,  but  the bonus based on
such determination will be prorated to take into account  that  it is based
on less than a full year. Company performance in respect  of calculations
made under the Bonus Plans and Company Plans for calendar year  2007 will be
calculated without taking into account, and will be adjusted to  exclude, any
expenses or costs associated with or arising as a result of  transactions
contemplated by this Agreement or any non-recurring charges that  would not
reasonably be expected to have been incurred had the transactions 
contemplated by this Agreement not occurred. Parent and its  Affiliates will
honor the Company's obligations pursuant to the Bonus  Plans. If a
participant in a Bonus Plan becomes entitled to a bonus  under a
corresponding bonus plan of Parent or its affiliate for 2007, such 
corresponding plan will take into account any benefit provided to the 
participant under such Bonus Plan.

 

 

(h) At  the  Effective Time, the Company may make payments under its sale of
business bonus  program subject to the limitations on the maximum amount
payable thereunder  as  set forth in Section 3.13(h) of the Company

Effective Time.

 

 

5.12 _Shareholder  Proceedings_. The Company will keep Parent reasonably
apprised of  all important developments relating to, and consult with Parent
with respect  to,  any Proceedings by a Company shareholder (including
derivative claims) relating  to the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, and, subject to applicable  Law, will use reasonable efforts to
defend against any such  Proceedings. Parent and Merger Sub may participate
in (but not  control) the defense of any such Proceedings, and, subject to
applicable Law,  the Company will reasonably cooperate with Parent and Merger
Sub to defend  against any such Proceedings. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
the  Company may not settle or offer to settle any such Proceedings without
the  prior  written consent of Parent (which consent may not be unreasonably
withheld,  conditioned or delayed).

under  Section 5.2; or

 

 

(iii) the  Company is in Breach of this Agreement, the Breach would result in
the failure  to satisfy one or more of the conditions set forth in Sections
6.1 or 6.2,  and  in any such case, the Breach is incapable of being cured

7.2 _Obligations  Upon Termination_.

 

 

(a) The  right  of termination under Section 7.1 is in addition to any other
rights that Parent,  Merger Sub or the Company may have under this Agreement
or otherwise, and the  exercise of a right of termination will not constitute
an election of remedies  and will not preclude an action for damages
resulting from a Breach of this  Agreement. If this Agreement is terminated,
all continuing  obligations of the parties under this Agreement will
terminate, except that  the  penultimate sentence of Section 5.5 (Access to
Information; Confidentiality),  Section 5.9 (fees and expenses), this Section
7.2 and Section 8 (miscellaneous  provisions) will survive indefinitely
unless sooner modified or terminated  in  writing by the parties.
Notwithstanding the second preceding  sentence, the parties agree that the
amounts payable upon the occurrence of  the  events specified clauses (i)
through (iii) of Section 7.2(b) will be the sole  and exclusive remedy of the
Parent and Merger Sub upon termination of the  Agreement arising from the
occurrence of such events.

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

45  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

(b) Notwithstanding  Section 5.9, the Company will pay to Parent a fee of
$9,000,000 (the " _Termination Fee_ ") by wire transfer of immediately
available funds to an  account designated by Parent if:

with the  Termination Fee due and payable prior to or concurrently with the
date of  termination;

 

 

(ii) this  Agreement is terminated by Parent under Section 7.1(c)(i) or
Section 7.1(c)(ii),  with the Termination Fee due and payable in each case
within one Business Day  after the date of termination; or

 

 

(iii) (1)  this  Agreement is terminated by Parent or the Company under
Section 7.1(b)(i) or  Section 7.1(b)(iii), or by Parent under 7.1(c)(iii),
(2)a Takeover Proposal  is  publicly made and not withdrawn prior to the
date of termination, and (3)within  one year after termination either the
Company enters into a definitive agreement  with respect to a Takeover
Proposal or a Takeover Proposal is consummated,  then  the Termination Fee
will be due and payable within one Business Day following  the earlier of the
date on which the Company enters into such a definitive  agreement or such
date on which the Takeover Proposal is  consummated.

 

 

(c) The  Company acknowledges that the agreements contained in Section 7.2(b)
are an  integral part of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and
that,  without these agreements, Parent would not enter into this 
Agreement. If the Company fails to pay the Termination Fee when due,  the
Termination Fee will be deemed to include the costs and expenses incurred 
by  Parent (including all fees and expenses of counsel) in connection with
the  collection under and enforcement of this Section 7.2, together with
interest  on  the unpaid Termination Fee, beginning on the date that the
Termination Fee  became due and continuing thereafter until paid in full, at
a rate equal to  the  prime rate of Citibank N.A. (as in effect on the date

(a) This  Agreement and the legal relations among the parties hereto will be

of the State  of  Delaware (without regard to the laws of conflict that
might otherwise apply)  as  to all matters (other than with respect to
matters governed by the GBCC),  including matters of validity, construction,
effect, performance and  remedies.

 

 

(b) The  parties hereto hereby irrevocably submit to the exclusive
jurisdiction of the  courts of the State of Delaware and the Federal courts
of the United States  of  America located in the State of Delaware in
respect of all matters arising  out  of or relating to this Agreement the
interpretation and enforcement of the  provisions of this Agreement, and of
the documents referred to in this  Agreement, and in respect of the
transactions contemplated hereby, and hereby  waive, and agree not to assert,
as a defense in any action, suit or proceeding  for the interpretation or
enforcement hereof or of any such document, that  it is  not subject thereto
or that such action, suit or proceeding may not be brought  or is not
maintainable in said courts or that the venue thereof may not be  appropriate
or that this Agreement or any such document may not be enforced  in  or by
such courts, and the Parties hereto irrevocably agree that all claims  with 
respect to such action or proceeding will be heard and determined
exclusively  in  such a Delaware State or Federal court. The Parties hereby
consent to  and grant any such court jurisdiction over the person of such
Parties solely  for  such purpose and over the subject matter of such
dispute and agree that mailing  of process or other papers in connection with

such other manner as may be permitted  by law will be valid and sufficient
service thereof.

 

 

8.9 _Counterparts_. This  Agreement may be executed in one or more
counterparts, each of which will be  deemed an original, but all of which
together will constitute one and the same  instrument. This Agreement will
become effective when one or more  counterparts have been signed by each of
the parties and delivered to the other  parties. Facsimile transmission of
any signed original document and  retransmission of any signed facsimile
transmission will be deemed the same  as  delivery of an original. At the

the event that any of  the  provisions of this Agreement are not performed
in accordance with their specific  terms or otherwise are Breached.
Therefore, each party (a) hereby waives, in any  action  for specific
performance, the defense of adequacy of a remedy at law and any  requirement
for the posting of any bond or other security in connection with  any  such
remedy; and (b)  agrees that the other parties will be entitled to specific
performance of this  Agreement in any Proceeding initiated to enforce the
terms hereof, including  the  issuance of an Order or Orders to prevent or
restrain any actual or threatened  Breach of this Agreement, in each case
without any requirement to post any  bond  or provide other security. The

8.11 _Entire  Agreement_. This Agreement, including the annexes, exhibits
and  schedules hereto, embody the entire agreement and understanding of the
parties  hereto in respect of the subject matter contained herein and
supersede all  prior  agreements and the understandings between the parties
with respect to such  subject matter, other than the Confidentiality
Agreement. No  discussions regarding, or exchange of drafts or comments in
connection with,  the  transactions contemplated herein will constitute an
agreement among the parties  hereto. Any agreement among the parties will

8.12 _Severability_. If  any term or other provision of this Agreement is
held to be invalid, illegal  or  incapable of being enforced by any rule of
Law or public policy, all other  terms  and provisions of this Agreement
will nevertheless remain in full force and  effect so long as the economics
or legal substance of the transactions  contemplated hereby are not affected
in any manner materially adverse to any  party. Upon determination that any
term or other provision hereof is  invalid, illegal or incapable of being
enforced, the parties hereto will  negotiate in good faith to modify this
Agreement so as to effect the original  intent of the parties as closely as
possible to the fullest extent permitted  by  applicable Law in an
acceptable manner to the end that the transactions  contemplated hereby are
fulfilled to the extent possible.
