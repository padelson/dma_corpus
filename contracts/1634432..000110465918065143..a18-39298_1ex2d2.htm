Nordisk Indemnified Parties (regardless of whether such Damages arise as a
result of the negligence, strict liability or any other liability under any
theory of law or equity of any Novo Nordisk Indemnified Party) arising out of
or resulting from:

 



 

(i) any inaccuracy, misrepresentation or breach of any representation or
warranty of Strongbridge in this Agreement or in any certificate or other
writing delivered pursuant hereto (determined without regard to any
qualification or exception contained therein relating to materiality or
Material Adverse Effect or any similar qualification or standard) ("
**Strongbridge Warranty Breach** "); and

 



 

(ii) any breach of any covenant or agreement of Strongbridge in this Agreement
(or any breach of any covenant or agreement of any member of the Strongbridge
Group in this Agreement prior to the Closing);

 



 

provided that Strongbridge shall not be liable for any Strongbridge Warranty

harmless from, any and all Damages (whether involving a Third-Party Claim or a
claim solely between the parties hereto) incurred or suffered by the

a result of the negligence, strict liability or any other liability under any
theory of law or equity of any Strongbridge Indemnified Party) arising out of
or resulting from:

 



 

(i) any inaccuracy, misrepresentation or breach of any representation or
warranty of Novo Nordisk in this Agreement or in any certificate or other
writing delivered pursuant hereto (determined without regard to any
qualification or exception contained therein relating to materiality or
Material Adverse Effect or any similar qualification or standard) (" **Novo
Nordisk Warranty Breach** "); and

 



 

(ii) any breach of any covenant or agreement of the Novo Nordisk in this
Agreement (or any breach of any covenant or agreement of Novo Nordisk or any
of its Subsidiaries in this Agreement prior to the Closing);

(a) The party seeking indemnification under Section 7.02 or Section 7.03 (the
" **Indemnified Party** ") agrees to give prompt notice in writing to the
party against whom indemnity is to be sought (the " **Indemnifying Party** ")
of the assertion of any claim or the commencement of any Action by any third
party (" **Third-Party Claim** ") in respect of which indemnity may be sought
thereunder. Such notice shall set forth in reasonable detail such Third-Party
Claim and the basis for indemnification (taking into account the information
then available to the Indemnified Party). The failure to so notify the
Indemnifying Party shall not relieve the Indemnifying Party of its obligations
hereunder, except to the extent such failure shall have materially and
adversely prejudiced the Indemnifying Party.

 



 

(b) The Indemnifying Party shall be entitled to participate in the defense of
any Third-Party Claim and, subject to the limitations set forth in this
Section 7.04, shall be entitled to control and appoint lead counsel reasonably
acceptable to the Indemnified Party for such defense, in each case at its own
expense; _provided_ that prior to assuming control of such defense, the
Indemnifying Party must (i) acknowledge that, based on the facts set forth in
the notice required by Section 7.04(a), it would have an indemnity obligation
for the Damages resulting from such Third-Party Claim as provided under this
Article 7 and (ii) furnish the Indemnified Party with reasonably satisfactory
evidence that the Indemnifying Party has adequate resources to defend the
Third-Party Claim and fulfill its indemnity obligations hereunder.

 



 

(c) The Indemnifying Party shall not be entitled to assume or maintain control
of the defense of any Third-Party Claim if (i) the Indemnifying Party does not
deliver the acknowledgment and evidence referred to in Section 7.04(b) within
30 days of receipt of notice

 



     

 

 



 

of the Third-Party Claim pursuant to Section 7.04(a), (ii) the Third-Party
Claim relates to or arises in connection with any criminal proceeding, action,
indictment, allegation or investigation, (iii) the Third-Party Claim seeks an
injunction or equitable relief against the Indemnified Party or any of its
Affiliates, (iv) the Third-Party Claim relates to or otherwise involves a
claim by a Governmental Authority or a customer of Strongbridge, (v) the
Indemnifying Party has failed or is failing to prosecute or defend the Third-
Party Claim vigorously or (vi) in the case of a Novo Nordisk Indemnified
Party, the amount of the Third-Party Claim, if determined in accordance with
the claimants demands, would reasonably be expected to result in any Damages,
together with all other unresolved claims for indemnification by the Novo
Nordisk Indemnified Parties, that would not be available for recovery under
this Article 7.

 



 

(d) If the Indemnifying Party shall assume the control of the defense of any
Third-Party Claim in accordance with the provisions of this Section 7.04, the
Indemnifying Party shall obtain the prior written consent of the Indemnified
Party before entering into any settlement of such Third-Party Claim;
_provided_ that consent of the Indemnified Party shall not be required for any
such settlement if (i) the sole relief provided is monetary damages that are
paid in full by the Indemnifying Party and (ii) such settlement includes an
unconditional release of the Novo Nordisk Indemnified Parties or the
Strongbridge Indemnified Parties, as the case may be, from all liability on
claims that are the subject matter of such Third-Party Claim and does not
include any statement as to or any admission of fault, culpability or failure
to act by or on behalf of the Novo Nordisk Indemnified Parties or the
Strongbridge Indemnified Parties, as the case may be. An Indemnified Party may
not settle any Third-Party Claim for which it is seeking indemnification
hereunder without the prior written consent of the Indemnifying Party, which
consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed; _provided_
that the Indemnified Party may admit liability with respect to, or settle,
compromise or discharge, such Third-Party Claim without the Indemnifying
Partys prior written consent so long as the Indemnified Party releases, to
the reasonable satisfaction of the Indemnifying Party, any claims to
indemnification with respect to such Third-Party Claim pursuant to this
Article 7.

 



 

(e) In circumstances where the Indemnifying Party is controlling the defense
of a Third-Party Claim in accordance with the foregoing, the Indemnified Party
shall be entitled to participate in the defense of any Third-Party Claim and
to employ separate counsel of its choice for such purpose, in which case the
fees and expenses of such separate counsel shall be borne by the Indemnified
Party; _provided_ that in such event the Indemnifying Party shall pay the fees
and expenses of such separate counsel (i) to the extent incurred by the
Indemnified Party prior to the date that the Indemnifying Party assumes
control of the defense of the Third-Party Claim or (ii) if the Indemnified
Party is advised by counsel that (A) there is a conflict of interest between
the Indemnifying Party and the Indemnified Party in the conduct of the defense
of such claim or (B) there may be one or more defenses or claims available to
the Indemnified Party that are different from or additional to those available
to the Indemnifying Party and that could be materially adverse to the
Indemnifying Party. In the case of the foregoing clause (ii), the Indemnifying
Party shall keep the Indemnified Party reasonably informed with respect to
such Third-Party Claim and cooperate with the Indemnified Party in connection
therewith.

 



 

(f) Each party shall cooperate, and cause its Affiliates to cooperate, in the
defense or prosecution of any Third-Party Claim and shall furnish or cause to
be furnished such records,

 



     

 

 



 

information and testimony, and attend such conferences, discovery proceedings,
hearings, trials or appeals, as may be reasonably requested in connection
therewith.

 



 

Section 7.05. _Direct Claim Procedures._ In the event an Indemnified Party has
a claim for indemnity under Section 7.02 or Section 7.03 against an
Indemnifying Party that does not involve a Third-Party Claim, the Indemnified
Party agrees to give prompt notice in writing of such claim to the
Indemnifying Party. Such notice shall set forth in reasonable detail such
claim and the basis for indemnification (taking into account the information
then available to the Indemnified Party). The failure to so notify the
Indemnifying Party shall not relieve the Indemnifying Party of its obligations
hereunder, except to the extent such failure shall have materially and
adversely prejudiced the Indemnifying Party. If the Indemnifying Party does
not notify the Indemnified Party in writing within 30 days following the
receipt of a notice with respect to any such claim that the Indemnifying Party
disputes its indemnity obligation to the Indemnified Party for any Damages
with respect to such claim, such Damages shall be conclusively deemed a
liability of the Indemnifying Party and the Indemnified Party shall be
entitled to prompt payment of all Damages arising out of such claim in
accordance with this Article 7. If the Indemnifying Party has timely disputed
its indemnity obligation for any Damages with respect to such claim, the
parties shall proceed in good faith to negotiate a resolution of such dispute
and, if not resolved through negotiations, such dispute shall be resolved by
litigation in an appropriate court of jurisdiction determined pursuant to
Section 9.07.

 



 

Section 7.06. _Exclusive Remedy_. The indemnification provisions contained in
this Article 7 shall be the exclusive remedy for any breach of the
representations, warranties, covenants and agreements set forth in this
Agreement or any other matter arising pursuant to this Agreement or the
transactions contemplated hereby, except claims based upon Fraud.

 



 

Section 7.07. _Purchase Price Adjustment_. Any amount paid by Strongbridge or
Novo Nordisk under this Article 7 shall be treated as an adjustment to the
Purchase Price.

following the Closing Date, if the Company receives a written request (a "
_Registration Request_ ") from any Shareholder Party that the Company file a
Registration Statement covering the registration of Registrable Securities as
of the date of such Registration Request, then the Company shall use
reasonable best efforts to, as promptly as possible, effect the registration
of such portion of the Registrable Securities set forth in such Registration
Request in accordance with the intended method of distribution stated in such
Registration Request, pursuant to a Registration Statement, to the extent
necessary to permit the disposition of the Registrable Securities to be so
registered. The Registration Request pursuant to this Section 3.1 must be in
writing and specify the number of Registrable Securities requested to be
registered and the intended method of distribution. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, the Company will not be obligated to file a Registration Statement
requested pursuant to this Section 3.1:

 



 

(i) on a total of more than one occasion (if, on such occasion, the
registration shall have been deemed to have been effected in accordance with
Section 3.1(b) of this Agreement);

 



 

(ii) in any particular jurisdiction in which the Company would be required to
execute a general consent to service of process in effecting such
registration, qualification or compliance, unless the Company is already
subject to service of process in such jurisdiction and except as may be
required by the 1933 Act; or

 



 

(iii) if the Shareholder Parties propose to dispose of Registrable Securities
that may be registered at such time pursuant to a Registration Statement
contemplated in Section 3.2.

 



     

 

 



 

(b) The registration requested pursuant to this Section 3.1 will not be deemed
to have been effected unless the Registration Statement has become effective;
_provided_ , _however_ , that if, within the period ending on the earlier to
occur of (i) 90 days after the applicable Registration Statement has become
effective ( _provided_ , that such period will be extended for a period of
time equal to the period the holder of Registrable Securities refrains from
selling any securities included in such Registration Statement at the request
of the Company or the lead managing underwriter(s) pursuant to the provisions
of this Agreement) and (ii) the date on which the distribution of the
securities covered thereby has been completed, the offering of securities
pursuant to such Registration Statement is interfered with by any stop order,
injunction or other order or requirement of the SEC or other Governmental
Authority, such Registration Statement will be deemed not to have been
effected; _provided_ , _further_ , that if the requesting Shareholder Parties,
after exercising their right to request a registration pursuant to this
Section 3.1 withdraw from a registration so requested after the filing
thereof, such registration will be deemed to have been effective with respect
to the Shareholder Parties in accordance with this Section 3.1.

 



 

(c) The Company may postpone the filing or effectiveness of any Registration
Statement and suspend the Shareholder Parties use of any prospectus which is
a part of the Registration Statement (in which event the Shareholder Parties
will discontinue sales of the Registrable Securities pursuant to the
Registration Statement) for a period of up to an aggregate of 60 days, and no
more than twice, in any 365-day period, exclusive of days covered by any lock-
up agreement executed by the Shareholder Parties in connection with any
underwritten Public Offering after the request for registration pursuant to
this Section 3.1 if the Company delivers to the Shareholder Parties a
certificate signed by either the chief executive officer or the chief
financial officer of the Company certifying that the conditions constituting a
Material Disclosure Event exist at such time.

 



 

(d) The Company will have the right to cause the registration of additional
securities for sale for the account of any Person other than the Shareholder
Parties (including the Company) in any registration requested pursuant to this
Section 3.1 to the extent the managing underwriter or other independent
marketing agent for such offering (if any) determines that, in its sole
judgment, the additional securities proposed to be sold will not reasonably be
expected to jeopardize the success of the offering and sale of the Registrable
Securities to be registered in accordance with the intended method or methods
of disposition then contemplated by such registration requested pursuant to
this Section 3.1.

 



 

(e) If the registration requested pursuant to this Section 3.1 involves an
underwritten Public Offering, the requesting Shareholder Parties will, after
consultation in good faith with the Company, select the investment banker(s)
and manager(s) that will serve as managing underwriters (including which such
managing underwriters will serve as lead or co-lead) and underwriters with
respect to the offering of such Registrable Securities; _provided_ , that such
investment banker(s) and manager(s) are reasonably acceptable to the Company
(such acceptance not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed).

 



 

Section 3.2 _Piggyback Registration_. (a) Subject to and after the expiration
of the period set forth in Section 2.1, if the Company proposes or is required
to file a Registration Statement or related prospectus supplement under the
1933 Act with respect to an offering of any

 



     

 

 



 

Ordinary Shares, whether or not for sale for its own account (other than a
Registration Statement (i) on Form S-4, Form S-8 or any similar form or (ii)
filed solely in connection with any employee benefit or dividend reinvestment
plan), then the Company will give prompt written notice of such proposed
filing at least 10 Business Days before the anticipated filing date (the "
_Piggyback Notice_ ") to the Shareholder Parties. Such Piggyback Notice must
specify the number of Ordinary Shares proposed to be registered, the proposed
date of filing of such Registration Statement or related prospectus
supplement, as applicable, with the SEC, the proposed means of distribution,
the proposed managing underwriter(s) (if any) and a good faith estimate by the
Company of the proposed minimum offering price of such Ordinary Shares. The
Piggyback Notice will offer the Shareholder Parties the opportunity to include
in such Registration Statement or related prospectus supplement, as
applicable, the number of Registrable Securities as it may request (a "
_Piggyback Registration_ "), subject to Section 3.2(b). The Company will
include in each such Piggyback Registration all Registrable Securities with
respect to which the Company has received a written request for inclusion
therein from any Shareholder Party within six (6) Business Days after the
Company has sent the Piggyback Notice, subject to Section 3.2(b). The
Shareholder Parties will be permitted to withdraw all or part of the
Registrable Securities from a Piggyback Registration at any time at least
three Business Days prior to the effective date of the Registration Statement
or the filing of the related prospectus supplement, as applicable, relating to
such Piggyback Registration. The Company shall have the right to terminate or
withdraw any registration initiated by it under this Section 3.2, whether or
not the Shareholder Parties have elected to include Registrable Securities in
such registration.

 



 

(b) If the managing underwriter or underwriters of a proposed underwritten
offering advise the Company and the holders of such Registrable Securities
that, in their sole judgment, the success of the offering would reasonably be
expected to be jeopardized by inclusion of the number of Registrable
Securities requested to be included (taking into account, in addition to any
considerations that the managing underwriter or underwriters reasonably deem
relevant, the timing and manner to effect the offering), then the number of
Registrable Securities to be offered for the account of the Shareholder
Parties shall be reduced to the extent necessary to reduce the total amount of
securities to be included in such offering to the amount recommended by such
managing underwriter or underwriters; _provided_ that if Ordinary Shares are
being offered for the account of Persons other than the Company, then the
Ordinary Shares intended to be offered for the account of such other Persons
shall be reduced pro rata to the extent necessary to permit the Shareholder
Parties to include all of its Registrable Securities in such offering.

Securities on the basis provided in any underwriting arrangements approved by

shoe" option requested by the managing underwriter(s), provided that such
Shareholder Party will not be required to sell more than the number of
Registrable Securities that such Shareholder Party has requested the Company
to include in any registration), (ii) completes and executes all
questionnaires, powers of attorney, indemnities, underwriting agreements,

such registration.

 



 

(b) Each Shareholder Party agrees that, in connection with any registration
hereunder, upon receipt of any notice from the Company of the happening of any
event of the kind described in Section 3.3(g), such Shareholder Party will
forthwith discontinue the disposition of its Registrable Securities pursuant
to the Registration Statement until such Shareholder Party receives copies of
a supplemented or amended prospectus as contemplated by such Section 3.3(g).
In the event the Company gives any such notice, the applicable time period
during which a Registration Statement is to remain effective under this
Article III shall be extended by the number of days during the period from and
including the date of the giving of such notice pursuant to this Section
3.6(b) to and including the date on which the Shareholder Parties will have

officers agree, not to effect (other than pursuant to such underwritten
offering, in accordance with this Agreement) any public sale or distribution
of Registrable Securities or make any short sale of, loan, grant any option
for the purchase of, or otherwise dispose of any Registrable Securities, any
other equity securities of the Company or any securities convertible into or
exchangeable or exercisable for any equity securities of the Company, without

may be, during such period as may be required by the managing underwriter(s);
_provided_ , that in no event shall such period exceed more than 90 days
following the date of the prospectus used in connection with such offering).

 



 

Section 3.8 _Indemnification_. (a) The Company agrees to indemnify and hold
harmless, to the fullest extent permitted by Applicable Law, the Shareholder
Parties and their respective Affiliates and their and their Affiliates
respective officers, directors, employees, managers and agents and each Person
who controls (within the meaning of Section 15 of the 1933 Act and Section 20
of the 1934 Act) any Shareholder Party or such other indemnified Person and
the officers, directors, employees, managers and agents of each such
controlling Person, each underwriter, if any, and each Person who controls
(within the meaning of Section 15 of the 1933 Act and Section 20 of the 1934
Act) such underwriter, from and against all losses, claims, damages,
liabilities, costs, expenses (including reasonable expenses of investigation
and reasonable attorneys fees and expenses), judgments, fines, penalties,
charges and amounts paid in settlement (collectively, the " _Losses_ "), as
incurred, arising out of, caused by, resulting from or relating to any untrue
statement (or alleged untrue statement) of a material fact contained in any
Registration Statement filed pursuant to this Article III, and any prospectus
or preliminary prospectus or issuer free writing prospectus or any amendment
or supplement thereto or any omission (or alleged omission) of a material fact
required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein, in
light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading and
(without limitation of the preceding portions of this Section 3.8(a)) will
reimburse each Shareholder Party, each of its Affiliates, and each of its and
their respective officers, directors, employees, managers and agents and each
such Person who controls such Shareholder Party and the officers, directors,
employees, managers and agents of each such controlling Person, each such
underwriter and each such Person who controls any such underwriter, for any
legal and any other expenses reasonably incurred in connection with
investigating and defending or settling any such claim, Loss, damage,
liability or action, except insofar as the same are caused by any information
furnished in writing to the Company by any other party expressly for use
therein.

 



 

(b) In connection with any Registration Statement in which a Shareholder Party
is participating the Shareholder shall indemnify the Company, its directors
and officers, and each Person who controls (within the meaning of Section 15
of the 1933 Act and Section 20 of the 1934 Act) the Company, from and against
all Losses, as incurred, arising out of, caused by, resulting from or relating
to any untrue statement (or alleged untrue statement) of material fact
contained in the Registration Statement, or any prospectus or preliminary
prospectus or issuer free writing prospectus or any amendment or supplement
thereto or any omission (or alleged omission) of a material fact required to
be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein, in light of the
circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, and (without
limitation of the preceding portions of this Section 3.8(b)) will reimburse
the Company, its directors and officers and each Person who controls the
Company (within the meaning of Section 15 of the 1933 Act and Section 20 of
the 1934 Act) for any legal and any other expenses reasonably incurred in
connection with investigating and defending or settling any such claim, Loss,
damage, liability or action, in each case solely to the extent, but only to
the extent, that such untrue statement or omission is made in such
Registration Statement, or any prospectus or preliminary prospectus or issuer
free writing prospectus or any amendment or

 



     

 

 



 

supplement thereto in reliance upon and in conformity with written information
furnished to the Company by the Shareholder Parties for inclusion in such
Registration Statement, prospectus or preliminary prospectus or issuer free
writing prospectus or any amendment or supplement thereto. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, no Shareholder Party will be liable under this Section 3.8(b) for
amounts in excess of the net proceeds received by such Shareholder Party in
the offering giving rise to such liability.

 



 

(c) Any Person entitled to indemnification hereunder will give prompt written
notice to the indemnifying party of any claim with respect to which it seeks
indemnification; _provided_ , _however_ , the failure to give such notice will
not release the indemnifying party from its obligation, except to the extent
that the indemnifying party has been actually and materially prejudiced by
such failure to provide such notice on a timely basis.

 



 

(d) In any case in which any such action is brought against any indemnified
party, and it notifies an indemnifying party of the commencement thereof, the
indemnifying party will be entitled to participate therein, and, to the extent
that it may wish, to assume the defense thereof, with counsel reasonably
satisfactory to such indemnified party, and after notice from the indemnifying
party to such indemnified party of its election so to assume the defense
thereof and acknowledging the obligations of the indemnifying party with
respect to such proceeding, the indemnifying party will not (so long as it
shall continue to have the right to defend, contest, litigate and settle the
matter in question in accordance with this paragraph) be liable to such
indemnified party hereunder for any legal or other expense subsequently
incurred by such indemnified party in connection with the defense thereof
other than reasonable costs of investigation (unless (i) such indemnified
party reasonably objects to such assumption on the grounds that there may be
defenses available to it which are different from or in addition to the
defenses available to such indemnifying party and, as a result, a conflict of
interest exists or (ii) the indemnifying party will have failed within a
reasonable period of time to assume such defense and the indemnified party is
or would reasonably be expected to be materially prejudiced by such delay, in
either event the indemnified party will be promptly reimbursed by the
indemnifying party for the reasonable expenses incurred in connection with
retaining one separate legal counsel (for the avoidance of doubt, for all
indemnified parties in connection therewith)). For the avoidance of doubt,
notwithstanding any such assumption by an indemnifying party, the indemnified
party will have the right to employ separate counsel in any such matter and
participate in the defense thereof, but the fees and expenses of such counsel
will be at the expense of such indemnified party except as provided in the
previous sentence. An indemnifying party will not be liable for any settlement
of an action or claim effected without its consent (which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed). No matter may be settled by an
indemnifying party without the consent of the indemnified party (which consent
shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed), unless such
settlement (i) includes as an unconditional term thereof the giving by the
claimant or plaintiff to such indemnified party of a release from all
liability in respect to such claim or litigation, (ii) does not include any
statement as to or any admission of fault, culpability or a failure to act by
or on behalf of any indemnified party and (iii) does not involve any
injunctive or equitable relief that would be binding on the indemnified party
or any payment that is not covered by the indemnification hereunder.

 



     

 

 



 

(e) The indemnification provided for under this Agreement shall survive the
disposal of the Registrable Securities and the termination of this Agreement.
