MERGER CORPORATION, a Delaware corporation and a wholly owned Subsidiary of Parent (" _Merger Sub_ "), and SPECIALTY UNDERWRITERS ALLIANCE, INC., a Delaware corporation (the " _Company_ " and, collectively with Parent and Merger Sub, the " _parties_ "). 

  

RECITALS 

   

 WHEREAS, the respective Boards of Directors of Parent and Merger Sub have determined that it is in the best interests of their respective companies to enter into this Agreement and to consummate the merger of Merger Sub with and into the Company (the " _Merger_ "), upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement; 

  

 WHEREAS, the Board of Directors of the Company has determined that it is in the best interests of the Company to enter into this Agreement and to consummate the Merger, upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement, and that the Merger is fair to, and in the best interests of, the stockholders of the Company; and 

  

 WHEREAS, for United States federal income tax purposes, it is intended that the Merger shall qualify as a "reorganization" within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the " _Code_ "), and the regulations promulgated thereunder. 

  

 NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing and the representations, warranties, covenants and agreements set forth in this Agreement, and intending to be legally bound hereby, the parties hereby agree as follows: 

  

ARTICLE I 
 THE MERGER; CERTAIN RELATED MATTERS  

  

 Section 1.1 _The Merger_. Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement and in accordance with the DGCL, at the Effective Time, Merger Sub shall be merged with and into the Company. As a result of the Merger, the separate corporate existence of Merger Sub will cease and the Company will continue under the name "Stinger" as the surviving corporation of the Merger under the DGCL (the " _Surviving Corporation_ "). 

  

 Section 1.2 _Closing; Effective Time_. Subject to the provisions of Article VII, the closing of the Merger (the " _Closing_ ") will take place at 10:00 a.m., New York City time, on the fifth Business Day after the satisfaction or, to the extent permitted by Law, waiver of the conditions set forth in Article VII (excluding conditions that, by their terms, cannot be satisfied until the Closing, but the Closing shall be subject to the satisfaction or, to the extent permitted by Law, waiver of those conditions), at the offices of Stroock and Stroock and Lavan LLP, 180 Maiden Lane, New York, New York, unless another time, date or place is agreed to in writing by the parties; _provided_ , _however_ , in the event that the Company delivers a Walk-Away Notice pursuant to Section 8.1(d)(iii) and Parent elects to deliver a Top-Up Notice, subject to the satisfaction or, to the extent permitted by Law, waiver of the conditions set forth in Article VII, the "Closing Date" shall be the third Business Day following delivery of such Top-Up Notice, unless another time, date or place is agreed to in writing by the parties. The date on which the 

   ##### 

  

    

Closing actually occurs is hereinafter referred to as the " _Closing Date_ ".
Subject to the provisions of this Agreement, as soon as practicable on the
Closing Date the Company shall file with the Secretary of State of the State
of Delaware a certificate of merger, executed in accordance with, and in such
form as is required by, the relevant provisions of the DGCL (the "
_Certificate of Merger_ "). The Merger shall become effective upon the filing
of the Certificate of Merger or at such later time as is agreed to by
the parties hereto and specified in the Certificate of Merger (the time at
which the Merger becomes effective is herein referred to as the " _Effective
Time_ "). The parties shall make all other filings or recordings required
under the DGCL in connection with the Merger. 

  

 Section 1.3 _Effects of the Merger_. The Merger shall have the effects set forth in the applicable provisions of the DGCL. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing and subject thereto, at the Effective Time, all the property, rights, privileges, immunities, powers and franchises of the Company and Merger Sub shall vest in the Surviving Corporation and all debts, liabilities and duties of the Company and Merger Sub shall become the debts, liabilities and duties of the Surviving Corporation. 

  

 Section 1.4 _Certificate of Incorporation; Bylaws_. At the Effective Time, the Certificate of Incorporation of the Company shall by virtue of the Merger be amended and restated in its entirety to read as set forth on Exhibit A hereto and, as so amended and restated, shall be the certificate of incorporation of the Surviving Corporation following the Effective Time until thereafter amended in accordance with its terms and applicable Law. At the Effective Time, the bylaws of Merger Sub, as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time, shall be the bylaws of the Surviving Corporation following the Effective Time until thereafter amended in accordance with the Constituent Documents of the Surviving Corporation and applicable Law, except that references to Merger Subs name shall be replaced by references to "Stinger." This Section 1.4 shall be subject to the obligations of Parent and the Surviving Corporation under Section 6.10. 

  

 Section 1.5 _Directors and Officers of Surviving Corporation_. As of the Effective Time, each of the directors of the Company shall resign and the directors of Merger Sub, at the Effective Time, shall be the directors of the Surviving Corporation until their successors have been duly elected and qualified or until their earlier death, resignation or removal in accordance with the Constituent Documents of the Surviving Corporation. The officers of the Company, at the Effective Time, shall, from and after the Effective Time, be the officers of the Surviving Corporation until their successors have been duly appointed and qualified or until their earlier death, resignation or removal in accordance with the Constituent Documents of the Surviving Corporation. 

  

 Section 1.6 _Effect on Capital Stock_. At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of Parent, Merger Sub, the Company or the holders of any of the following securities: 

  

 (a) Each share of common stock of Merger Sub issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be converted into and become one validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable share of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of the Surviving Corporation. 

   ##### 

  

  

 (b) Each share of (i) common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of the Company (such shares, collectively, the " _Common Stock_ ", and each, a " _Common Share_ ") and (ii) Class B Common Stock, par value $0.01 per share, of the Company (the " _Class B Stock_", and each, a " _Class B Share_", and the Class B Shares collectively with the Common Shares, the " _Company Shares_ "), in each case issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than any shares of Common Stock or Class B Stock to be canceled pursuant to Section 1.6(c) and any Dissenting Shares), shall be converted into the right to receive an amount per Company Share (subject to any applicable withholding Tax specified in Section 2.2) equal to an amount of Parent Common Stock equal to the product of one Company Share and the Common Exchange Ratio (which Common Exchange Ratio is subject to adjustment as set forth herein) and any cash paid in lieu of fractional shares in accordance with Section 2.1(d) (collectively, the " _Merger Consideration_ "). At the Effective Time, each Company Share converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration pursuant to this Article I shall automatically be cancelled and shall cease to exist and each holder of a certificate theretofore representing any such Company Shares (each, a " _Certificate_ ") or non-certificated Company Shares represented by book-entry (" _Book-Entry Shares_ ") shall cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except the right to receive (i) the Merger Consideration upon surrender of such Certificates or Book-Entry Shares in accordance with Section 2.1(c), without interest (subject to any applicable withholding Tax specified in Section 2.2); and (ii) any dividends and other distributions in accordance with Section 1.8. 

  

 (c) Each Company Share held in the treasury of the Company, if any, or otherwise owned by Parent or Merger Sub, or owned by any direct or indirect Subsidiary of any such Person (other than Company Shares held in an investment portfolio), in each case immediately prior to the Effective Time, shall automatically be canceled and retired and cease to exist without any conversion thereof and no consideration shall be paid in exchange therefor. 

  

 Section 1.7 _Treatment of Options and Other Company Equity Awards_  

  

 (a) At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of the holders thereof, each stock option issued pursuant to an Incentive Plan (each, an " _Option_ ") and other equity-based awards (excluding Deferred Stock Awards, which are discussed in Section 1.7(b) below) issued pursuant to an Incentive Plan denominated in shares of Common Stock (each such award, a " _Company Compensatory Award_ ") that is outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time, whether or not then vested, deliverable or exercisable, shall be assumed by Parent and converted automatically at the Effective Time into an option or such other substantially identical equity-based award, as the case may be, denominated in shares of Parent Common Stock and which has other terms and conditions substantially identical to those of the related Company Compensatory Award (including any accelerated vesting provisions therein) except that (i) the number of shares of Parent Common Stock subject to each such award shall be determined by multiplying the number of shares of Common Stock subject to such Company Compensatory Award immediately prior to the Effective Time by the Award Exchange Ratio and (ii) if applicable, the exercise or purchase price per share of Parent Common Stock (rounded upwards to the nearest whole cent) shall equal (x) the per share exercise or purchase price for the shares of Common Stock otherwise purchasable pursuant to such Company Compensatory Award immediately prior to the Effective Time divided by (y) the Award Exchange Ratio;  _provided_ , _however_ , that in no case shall the exchange of an Option or 

   ##### 

  

    

any other Company Compensatory Award be performed in a manner that is not in
compliance with the adjustment requirements of Section 409A of the Code and
in the case of any Option that is intended to be an "incentive stock option"
under Section 422 of the Code, such Option shall be determined in a
manner consistent with the requirements of Section 424(a) of the Code. The
portion of any Options that are vested and/or exercisable at the Effective
Time shall be converted into vested and/or exercisable options, as
applicable, denominated in shares of Parent Common Stock, and the portion of
any Options that are unvested and/or not exercisable at the Effective Time
shall, after being converted into options denominated in shares of Parent
Common Stock, be subject to the same terms and conditions of vesting and
exercisability as the applicable Option was immediately prior to
the Effective Time. 

  

 (b) Prior to the Effective Time, the Board of Directors of the Company or the appropriate committee of the Board of Directors of the Company, if necessary, shall adopt a resolution providing that, at the Effective Time, each deferred stock award in respect of a Company Share issued pursuant to an Incentive Plan (a " _Deferred Stock Award_ ") shall be converted into the right to receive a deferred stock award in respect of a share of Parent Common Stock at the Award Exchange Ratio, rounded down to the nearest whole share (subject to any applicable withholding Tax specified in Section 2.2); _provided_ _that_ such converted deferred stock awards in respect of Parent Common Stock shall remain subject to the same restrictions that applied to the Deferred Stock Award immediately prior to the Effective Time and shall otherwise have the same terms and conditions (including vesting dates and date of settlement in shares) as were in effect with respect to the corresponding Deferred Stock Award immediately prior to the Effective Time. Any portion of any Deferred Stock Award that is vested as of the Effective Time shall be converted into vested deferred stock awards in respect of shares of Parent Common Stock, and any portion of any Deferred Stock Awards that is unvested at the Effective Time shall, after being converted into deferred stock awards denominated in shares of Parent Common Stock, be subject to the same terms and conditions of vesting (including any accelerated vesting provisions therein) and delivery as the applicable Deferred Stock Award was immediately prior to the Effective Time. 

  

 (c) Parent shall take such actions as are necessary for the assumption and conversion of the Options and other Company Compensatory Awards pursuant to Section 1.7(a), including the reservation, issuance and listing of shares of Parent Common Stock as is necessary to effectuate the transactions contemplated by Section 1.7(a). As soon as reasonably practicable after the Effective Time, Parent shall deliver to each holder of any Options and other Company Compensatory Awards an appropriate notice setting forth such holders rights pursuant to such Options and agreements evidencing the grants of such Company Compensatory Awards, and stating that the Incentive Plans and such Options and agreements have been assumed by Parent and shall continue in effect on the same terms and conditions (subject to the adjustments required by Section 1.7(a) after giving effect to the Merger and the terms of the Incentive Plans). Parent shall prepare and file with the SEC a registration statement on Form S-8 with respect to the shares of Parent Common Stock issuable upon exercise of the assumed Company Compensatory Awards promptly following the Effective Time (and in no event later than 10 Business Days after the Effective Time) and Parent shall exercise commercially reasonable efforts to maintain the effectiveness of such registration statement for so long as such assumed Company Compensatory Awards remain outstanding. The Company and its counsel shall reasonably cooperate with and assist Parent in the preparation of such registration statement.

 (d) Subject to Parents compliance with the preceding provisions of this Section 1.7, the parties agree that, following the Effective Time, no holder of an Option, a Company Compensatory Award or a Deferred Stock Award or any participant in any Incentive Plan or employee benefit arrangement of the Company or under any employment agreement shall have any right hereunder to acquire any equity interest (including any "phantom" stock or stock appreciation rights) in the Company, any of its Subsidiaries or the Surviving Corporation. 

  

 (e) As soon as reasonably practicable following the date of this Agreement and in any event prior to the Effective Time, the Companys Board of Directors (or, if appropriate, any committee administering Incentive Plans) shall adopt such resolutions and take such actions that are necessary for the treatment of the Options, Company Compensatory Awards and Deferred Stock Awards pursuant to this Section 1.7. 

  

 Section 1.8 _Certain Adjustments_. If, between the date of this Agreement and the Effective Time, the Common Stock or Parent Common Stock is changed into a different number of shares or a different class by reason of any reclassification, recapitalization, reorganization, combination or exchange of shares, stock split, reverse stock split or a stock dividend or dividend payable in any other securities or any similar transaction or any transaction having the effect of any of the foregoing, the Merger Consideration shall be appropriately adjusted to provide to the holders of Company Shares and the holders of Options and Deferred Stock Awards the same economic effect as contemplated by this Agreement prior to such action and as so adjusted shall, from and after the date of such event, be the Merger Consideration. 

  

 Section 1.9 _Appraisal Rights_. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, Class B Shares that are issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time and which are held by a stockholder who did not vote in favor of the Merger (or consent thereto in writing) and who is entitled to demand and properly demands appraisal of such shares pursuant to, and who complies in all respects with, the provisions of Section 262 of the DGCL (the " _Dissenting Stockholders_ "), shall not be converted into or be exchangeable for the right to receive the Merger Consideration (the " _Dissenting Shares_ "), but instead such holder shall be entitled to payment by the Company of the fair value of such shares in accordance with the provisions of Section 262 of the DGCL (and at the Effective Time, such Dissenting Shares shall no longer be outstanding and shall automatically be canceled and shall cease to exist, and such holder shall cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except the right to receive the fair value of such Dissenting Shares in accordance with the provisions of Section 262 of the DGCL), unless and until such holder shall have failed to perfect or shall have effectively withdrawn or lost rights to appraisal under the DGCL. If any Dissenting Stockholder shall have failed to perfect or shall have effectively withdrawn or lost such right, such holders Class B Shares shall thereupon be treated as if they had been converted into and become exchangeable for the right to receive, as of the Effective Time, the Merger Consideration for each such Class B Share, in accordance with Section 1.6(b), without any interest thereon. The Company shall give Parent (i) prompt notice of any written demands for appraisal of any Class B Shares, attempted withdrawals of such demands and any other instruments served pursuant to Section 262 of the DGCL and received by the Company relating to stockholders rights of appraisal, and (ii) the opportunity to participate in all negotiations and proceedings with respect to demands for appraisal under the DGCL.

ARTICLE II 
 PAYMENT AND EXCHANGE OF CERTIFICATES; WITHHOLDING 

   

 Section 2.1 _Payment and Exchange of Certificates_. 

  

 (a) Following the date of this Agreement and in any event not less than five (5) Business Days prior to the mailing of the Proxy Statement/Prospectus to the stockholders of the Company, Parent shall designate a bank or trust company reasonably acceptable to the Company to act as exchange agent (the " _Exchange Agent_ ") for purposes of, among other things, paying the Merger Consideration. At or prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall deposit with the Exchange Agent, for the benefit of the holders of Certificates, Book-Entry Shares and Deferred Stock Awards, cash and certificates, or at Parents option, shares in book entry form representing the shares of Parent Common Stock to be exchanged in the Merger, in an amount sufficient to pay the aggregate Merger Consideration to which all holders of Company Shares and Deferred Stock Awards become entitled pursuant to Article I and such cash in lieu of fractional shares to be paid pursuant to Section 2.1(d) (the " _Aggregate Merger Consideration_ ") (the Aggregate Merger Consideration, and any proceeds thereof being hereinafter referred to as the " _Exchange Fund_ "). 

  

 (b) The Exchange Agent shall invest the cash included in the Exchange Fund as directed in writing by Parent in (i) direct obligations of the United States of America, (ii) obligations for which the full faith and credit of the United States of America is pledged to provide for payment of all principal and interest, and (iii) commercial paper obligations rated A-1 or P1 or better by Moodys Investors Service, Inc. or Standard and Poors Corporation, respectively, or a combination of the foregoing or in certificates of deposit, bank repurchase agreements or bankers acceptances of commercial banks with capital exceeding $1,000,000,000 and, in any such case, no such instrument shall have a maturity exceeding three months. Any interest and other income resulting from such investments shall be paid to and be income of Parent. If for any reason (including losses) the cash in the Exchange Fund shall be insufficient to fully satisfy all of the payment obligations to be made in cash by the Exchange Agent hereunder, Parent shall promptly deposit cash into the Exchange Fund in an amount that is equal to the deficiency required to fully satisfy such cash payment obligations. 

  

 (c) Promptly, and in any event no later than three (3) Business Days, after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall cause the Exchange Agent to mail to each Person who was a record holder of Company Shares immediately prior to the Effective Time, whose Company Shares were converted pursuant to Article I into the right to receive the Merger Consideration, (A) a form of letter of transmittal for use in effecting the surrender of Certificates in order to receive payment of the Merger Consideration (which letter of transmittal shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the Certificate shall pass, only upon actual delivery of the Certificates to the Exchange Agent (or effective affidavits of loss in lieu thereof), and shall otherwise be in customary form and contain customary provisions), and (B) instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the Certificates (or effective affidavits of loss in lieu thereof) in exchange for the Merger Consideration and any dividends or other distributions to which such holder is entitled pursuant to Section 1.8. Upon surrender to the Exchange Agent of a Certificate (or effective affidavit of loss in lieu thereof), together with a properly completed and executed letter of transmittal and any other required documents, the Exchange Agent shall promptly deliver to the holder of the Company Shares represented by the Certificate (or effective 

   ##### 

  

    

affidavit of loss in lieu thereof), or as otherwise directed in the letter of
transmittal, the Merger Consideration in the form of shares of Parent Common
Stock and cash and any dividends or other distributions to which such holder
is entitled pursuant to Section 1.8, with regard to each Company Share
represented by such Certificate, less any required withholding Taxes as
specified in Section 2.2, and the Certificate shall be canceled. No
interest shall be paid or accrued on the Merger Consideration, payable upon
the surrender of Certificates. If delivery of the Merger Consideration is to
be made to a Person holding a Certificate other than the Person in whose name
a surrendered Certificate is registered, it shall be a condition of delivery
that the Certificate so surrendered must be properly endorsed or otherwise be
in proper form for transfer, and the Person who surrenders the Certificate
must provide funds for payment of any transfer or other Taxes required by
reason of delivery to a Person other than the registered holder of the
surrendered Certificate or establish to the reasonable satisfaction of the
Surviving Corporation that all Taxes have been paid or are not applicable.
Subject to Section 1.9, after the Effective Time, a Certificate shall
represent only the right to receive the Merger Consideration in respect of
the Company Shares represented by such Certificate. Notwithstanding anything
to the contrary contained in this Agreement, any holder of Book-Entry Shares
shall not be required to deliver a Certificate or an executed letter of
transmittal to the Exchange Agent in order to receive the Merger
Consideration that such holder is entitled to receive pursuant to this
Article II. 

  

 (d) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, no fraction of a share of Parent Common Stock will be issued in connection with the Merger, and, in lieu thereof, any Company stockholder who would otherwise have been entitled to a fraction of a share of Parent Common Stock, upon surrender of title to Company Shares for exchange, shall be paid upon such surrender (and after taking into account and aggregating Company Shares represented by all Certificates and Book-Entry Shares surrendered by such holder), cash (without interest) in an amount equal to the product obtained by multiplying (i) the fractional share interest to which such stockholder (after taking into account and aggregating all Company Shares represented by all Certificates and Book-Entry Shares) would otherwise be entitled by (ii) the Closing Date Market Price. 

  

 (e) If a Certificate has been lost, stolen or destroyed, Parent and the Surviving Corporation will cause the Exchange Agent to accept an affidavit of that fact by the Person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed instead of the Certificate; _provided_   _that_ the Surviving Corporation may require the Person to whom any Merger Consideration is paid, as a condition precedent to the payment thereof, to give the Surviving Corporation a bond in such reasonable amount as it may direct or otherwise indemnify the Surviving Corporation in a manner reasonably satisfactory to the Surviving Corporation against any claim that may be made against the Surviving Corporation with respect to the Certificate claimed to have been lost, stolen or destroyed. 

  

 (f) At any time which is more than six (6) months after the Effective Time, Parent shall be entitled to require the Exchange Agent to deliver to it any portion of the Exchange Fund that had been deposited with the Exchange Agent and has not been disbursed in accordance with this Article II (including interest and other income received by the Exchange Agent in respect of the funds made available to it), and after the Exchange Fund has been delivered to Parent, Persons entitled to payment in accordance with this Article II shall be entitled to look solely to Parent (subject to abandoned property, escheat or similar Laws) for payment of the Merger 

   ##### 

  

    

Consideration upon surrender of the Certificates held by them, without any
interest thereon. Any portion of the Exchange Fund deposited with the
Exchange Agent remaining unclaimed by holders of Company Shares five (5)
years after the Effective Time shall, to the extent permitted by applicable
Law, become the property of Parent free and clear of any claims or interest
of any Person previously entitled thereto. None of the Surviving Corporation,
Parent, Merger Sub, any of their respective Affiliates or the Exchange Agent
will be liable to any Person entitled to payment under this Article II for any
consideration which is delivered, in accordance with the terms of this
Agreement, to Parent in accordance with the immediately preceding sentence or
to a public official or Governmental Entity pursuant to any abandoned
property, escheat or similar Law. 

  

 (g) From and after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall not record on the stock transfer books of the Company or the Surviving Corporation any transfers of shares of Common Stock or shares of Class B Stock that were outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time. If, after the Effective Time, Certificates (or effective affidavits of loss in lieu thereof) or Book-Entry Shares are presented for transfer, they shall be canceled and treated as having been surrendered for the Merger Consideration in respect of the Company Shares represented thereby. 

  

 Section 2.2 _Withholding Rights_. Each of Parent and the Exchange Agent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the consideration otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement to any holder of Company Shares, Options, Company Compensatory Awards or Deferred Stock Awards such amounts as it is lawfully required to deduct and withhold with respect to the making of such payment under the Code or any provision of state or local Law or the Laws of any other domestic or foreign jurisdiction. To the extent that amounts are so withheld and paid to the appropriate taxing authority by Parent or the Exchange Agent, as the case may be, such withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the holder of the Company Shares, Options, Company Compensatory Awards or Deferred Stock Awards, as the case may be, in respect of which such deduction and withholding was made.

Nothing herein shall be deemed to be a guarantee of employment for any current or former employee of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, or to restrict the right of Parent or the Surviving Corporation to terminate any such employee or to give any person any right to any specific terms or conditions of employment. 

   #####

 (c) From and after the Effective Time, except as otherwise agreed in writing between Parent and a Company employee, Parent will cause the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries to honor, in accordance with its terms (including any rights of amendment, modification or termination provided therein), (i) each existing employment, change in control, severance and termination protection plan or agreement between the Company or any of its Subsidiaries and any officer, director or employee, (ii) all obligations in effect as of the Effective Time under any bonus, bonus deferral and vacation plans, programs or agreements of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries and (iii) all obligations in effect as of the Effective Time pursuant to any outstanding retention or equity based plans, programs or agreements, and all vested and accrued benefits under any employee benefit, employment compensation or similar plans, programs, agreements or arrangements of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries. 

  

 (d) With respect to matters described in this Section 6.6 (and the matters described in Section 1.7), the Company shall consult with Parent (and consider in good faith the advice of Parent) prior to sending any material notices or other material communication materials to its employees or former employees.

Parent shall have received from Debevoise and Plimpton LLP, counsel to Parent, a written opinion dated the Closing Date to the effect that for U.S. federal income tax purposes (i) the Merger will constitute a "reorganization" within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code and (ii) Parent and the Company will each be a party to that reorganization within the meaning of Section 368(b) of the Code. In rendering such opinion, counsel to Parent shall be entitled to rely upon assumptions and representations provided by Parent and the Company substantially in the form of Exhibits B and C (allowing for such amendments to the representations as counsel to Parent reasonably deems necessary for purposes of providing the opinion referred to in the preceding sentence or to account for changes in facts or circumstances as of the Closing Date). 

   ##### 

  

  

 (f) _No Material Adverse Effect_. No event, change, circumstance or effect shall have occurred since the date hereof that has had or would, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Company Material Adverse Effect.

Except for the representations and warranties of Parent and Merger Sub set forth in Sections 4.1, 4.2, 4.5, 4.9(ii) and 4.14, each of the representations and warranties of Parent and Merger Sub set forth in this Agreement shall be true and correct (without giving effect to any qualification or limitation as to "materiality" or "Parent Material Adverse Effect" set forth therein) as of the date of this Agreement and as of the Closing Date as though made on and as of the Closing Date (except to the extent expressly made as of an earlier date, in which case as of such earlier date), except where the failure of such representations and warranties to be true and correct (without giving effect to any qualification or limitation as to "materiality" or "Parent Material Adverse Effect" set forth therein) would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Parent Material Adverse Effect. 

  

 (b) _Performance of Obligations of Parent and Merger Sub_. Each of Parent and Merger Sub shall have performed or complied in all material respects with all agreements and covenants required to be performed by it under this Agreement at or prior to the Closing.

In rendering such opinion, counsel to the Company shall be entitled to rely upon assumptions and representations provided by Parent and the Company substantially in the form of Exhibits B and C (allowing for such amendments to the representations as counsel to the Company reasonably deems necessary for purposes of providing the opinion referred to in the preceding sentence or to account for changes in facts or circumstances as of the Closing Date). 

  

 Section 7.4 _Frustration of Closing Conditions_. None of the Company, Parent or Merger Sub may rely on the failure of any condition set forth in this Article VII to be satisfied if such partys failure to act in good faith or to use its reasonable best efforts to consummate the 

   ##### 

  

    

transactions contemplated hereby in accordance with Section 6.5 has been the
principal cause of the failure of such condition to be satisfied.

(or of any resulting parent company of the Company) in the definition of
"Takeover Proposal" shall be deemed to be a reference to "more than seventy-
five percent (75%)," and (ii) "more than twenty percent (20%)" when
referring to the assets or the net income of the Company and its Subsidiaries
in the definition of Takeover Proposal shall be deemed to be references to

For purposes of this Section 8.3(c), each reference to (i) "more than twenty percent (20%)" when referring to the voting securities or equity securities of the Company (or of any resulting parent company of the Company) in the definition of "Takeover Proposal" shall be deemed to be a reference to "more than seventy-five percent (75%)," and (ii) "more than twenty percent (20%)" when referring to the assets or the net income of the Company and its Subsidiaries in the definition of Takeover Proposal shall be deemed to be references to "all or substantially all".

 (g) The parties agree and understand that in no event shall (i) the Company be required to pay the Termination Fee or the Parents Transaction Expenses, respectively, on more than one occasion and (ii) Parent be required to pay the Companys Transaction Expenses on more than one occasion. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, if any party receives any payments from another party in respect of any breach of this Agreement, and the receiving party is entitled to receive or has received the Termination Fee or its Transaction Expenses under this Section 8.3, (x) if the payment in respect of the applicable breach is made before the payment of the Termination Fee and Transaction Expenses, the amount of such Termination Fee and Transaction Expenses shall be reduced by the aggregate amount of any payments made by the breaching party in respect of any such breaches of this Agreement and (y) if the payment of the Termination Fee and Transaction Expenses is made before the payment in respect of the applicable breach, the amount of such payments in respect of the applicable breach shall be reduced by the aggregate amount of the payment in respect of the Termination Fee and Transaction Expenses. The parties acknowledge that the agreements contained in this Section 8.3 are an integral part of the transactions contemplated hereby, and that, without these agreements, the parties would not enter into this Agreement, and that any amounts payable pursuant to this Section 8.3 do not constitute a penalty. If a party fails to pay as directed in writing by the other party the Termination Fee or the Transaction Expenses due pursuant to this Section 8.3 within the time periods specified in this Section 8.3, the party obligated to pay the Termination Fee or Transaction Expenses shall pay the out-of-pocket costs and expenses (including reasonable legal fees and expenses of outside counsel) incurred by the other party in connection with any action, including the filing of any lawsuit, taken to collect payment of such amounts, together with interest on such unpaid amounts at the prime lending rate prevailing during such period as published in The Wall Street Journal, calculated on a daily basis from the date such amounts were required to be paid until the date of actual payment.

Termination of this Agreement prior to the Effective Time shall not require the approval of the stockholders of the Company. A terminating party shall provide written notice of termination to the other parties specifying with reasonable particularity the basis for this termination. If more than one provision in Section 8.1 is available 

   ##### 

  

    

to a terminating party in connection with a termination, a terminating party
may rely on any or all available provisions in Section 8.1 for any
termination.

 (a) When a reference is made in this Agreement to a Section, clause or Schedule, such reference shall be to a Section or clause of or Schedule to this Agreement unless otherwise indicated. The table of contents and headings contained in this Agreement are for reference purposes only and shall not affect in any way the meaning or interpretation of this Agreement. The phrases "the date of this Agreement", "the date hereof" and terms of similar import, will be deemed to refer to June 21, 2009. Whenever the content of this Agreement permits, the masculine gender will include the feminine and neuter genders, and a reference to singular or plural will be interchangeable with the other. Whenever the words "include", "includes" or "including" are used in this Agreement, they shall be deemed to be followed by the words "without limitation". 

  

 (b) References to any agreement or contract are to that agreement or contract as amended, modified or supplemented from time to time in accordance with the terms hereof and thereof. References to any Person include the successors and permitted assigns of that Person. References to any statute are to that statute, as amended from time to time, and to the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder. References to "$" and "dollars" are to the currency of the United States of America. References from or through any date mean, unless otherwise specified, from and including or through and including, respectively. The words "hereby," "herein," "hereof," "hereunder" and words of similar import refer to this Agreement as a whole (including any Schedules delivered herewith) and not merely to the specific section, paragraph or clause in which such word appears. 

  

 (c) The parties have participated jointly in negotiating and drafting this Agreement. In the event that an ambiguity or a question of intent or interpretation arises, this Agreement shall be construed as if drafted jointly by the parties, and no presumption or burden of proof shall arise favoring or disfavoring any party by virtue of the authorship of any provision of this Agreement. 

  

 (d) No summary of this Agreement or Schedule delivered herewith prepared by or on behalf of any party will affect the meaning or interpretation of this Agreement or any such Schedule. 

  

 Section 9.4 _Counterparts; Effectiveness_. This Agreement may be executed in two (2) or more counterparts, including by facsimile, each of which shall be deemed to be an original but 

   ##### 

  

    

all of which shall constitute one and the same instrument. This Agreement
shall become effective when each party has received counterparts thereof
signed and delivered (by electronic communication, facsimile or otherwise) by
all of the other parties. 

  

 Section 9.5 _Entire Agreement; No Third Party Beneficiaries_. 

  

 (a) This Agreement, the Company Disclosure Schedule, the Parent Disclosure Schedule and the Confidentiality Agreement constitute the entire agreement, and supersede all prior agreements and understandings, both written and oral, among the parties with respect to the subject matter hereof and thereof. 

  

 (b) This Agreement is not intended to, and shall not, confer upon any other Person other than the parties any rights or remedies hereunder, except (i) as set forth in Section 6.10 and (ii) from and after the Effective Time, the rights of holders of Common Shares, Options and Restricted Stock Awards to receive the Merger Consideration or other payments set forth in Article II. 

  

 (c) The representations and warranties in this Agreement are the product of negotiations among the parties and are for the sole benefit of the parties. Any inaccuracies in such representations and warranties are subject to waiver by the parties in accordance with Section 9.9(b) without notice or liability to any other Person. In some instances, the representations and warranties in this Agreement may represent an allocation among the parties of risks associated with particular matters regardless of the knowledge of any of the parties. Consequently, Persons other than the parties may not rely upon the representations and warranties in this Agreement as characterizations of actual facts or circumstances as of the date of this Agreement or as of any other date. 

  

 Section 9.6 _Severability_. If any term or other provision of this Agreement is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced by any Law or public policy, all other terms and provisions of this Agreement shall nevertheless remain in full force and effect so long as the economic or legal substance of the transactions contemplated hereby is not affected in any manner materially adverse to any party. Notwithstanding the foregoing, upon such determination that any term or other provision is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced, the parties shall negotiate in good faith to modify this Agreement so as to effect the original intent of the parties as closely as possible in an acceptable manner in order that the transactions contemplated hereby are consummated as originally contemplated to the greatest extent possible. 

  

 Section 9.7 _Assignment_. Neither this Agreement nor any of the rights, interests or obligations hereunder shall be assigned by any of the parties, in whole or in part (whether by operation of law or otherwise), without the prior written consent of the other parties, and any attempt to make any such assignment without such consent shall be null and void. This Agreement will be binding upon, inure to the benefit of and be enforceable by the parties and their respective successors and assigns. 

  

 Section 9.8 _Amendment_. This Agreement may be amended by the parties, by action taken or authorized by their respective boards of directors, at any time before or after the Requisite Stockholder Vote is obtained, but after such approval no amendment shall be made 

   ##### 

  

    

which by Law or in accordance with the rules of any relevant stock exchange
requires further approval by the stockholders of the Company without such
further approval. This Agreement may not be amended except by an instrument
in writing signed on behalf of each of the parties. 

  

 Section 9.9 _Extension; Waiver_. At any time prior to the Effective Time, the parties, by action taken or authorized by their respective boards of directors, may, to the extent legally allowed, (a) extend the time for the performance of any of the obligations or other acts of the other parties, (b) to the extent permitted by applicable Law, waive any inaccuracies in the representations and warranties contained herein or in any document delivered pursuant hereto and (c) to the extent permitted by applicable Law, waive compliance with any of the agreements or conditions contained herein. Any agreement on the part of a party to any such extension or waiver shall be valid only if set forth in a written instrument signed on behalf of such party. The failure of any party to this Agreement to assert any of its rights under this Agreement or otherwise shall not constitute a waiver of such rights, nor shall any single or partial exercise by any party to this Agreement of any of its rights under this Agreement preclude any other or further exercise of such rights or any other rights under this Agreement. 

  

 Section 9.10 _Governing Law and Venue; Waiver of Jury Trial_. 

  

 (a) This Agreement and any disputes or controversies arising out of or relating to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby (whether in contract, tort or otherwise) shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Delaware, without regard to principles of conflicts of law thereof that are not mandatorily applicable by statute and would permit or require the application of the laws of another jurisdiction.

   Re:  |   | The Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated as of [],
2009, among 
 [Parent], [Parent] Merger Corporation and Stinger  
  

  

Ladies and Gentlemen:  

  

 This certificate is being delivered to you in connection with your rendering the tax opinions referred to in section 7.2(e) of the Agreement and Plan of Merger (the " _Merger Agreement_ "), dated as of [], 2009, among [Parent] (" _Parent_ "), [Parent] Merger Corporation (" _Merger Sub_ ") and Stinger (the " _Company_ "). Capitalized terms not defined herein have the meanings set forth in the Merger Agreement. 

  

 Parent hereby represents and certifies that the following statements are true, correct and complete as of the date hereof and will be true, correct and complete at the Effective Time: 

  

     1.  |   | Parent has entered into the Merger Agreement and will
effect the Merger for the bona fide business reasons set forth in the Proxy
Statement/Prospectus.  
---|---|--- 
      
  2.  |   | The Merger will be consummated in compliance with the terms of
the Merger Agreement and none of the material terms and conditions thereof
has been or will be waived or modified. The Merger Agreement represents the
entire understanding among Parent, Merger Sub and the Company with respect to
the Merger.  
      
  3.  |   | The consideration to be received in the Merger by the
shareholders of the Company was determined by arms length negotiations
between Parent and the Company. In connection with the Merger, shareholders
of the Company will not receive, directly or indirectly, any consideration
other than shares of Parent Common Stock and cash in lieu of fractional
shares of Parent Common Stock.   
  

  ##### 

  

  

    4.  |   | To the best of the knowledge of Parents management, the
shareholders of the Company, other than the owners of the Class B Shares,
will have no dissenters rights in the Merger.  
---|---|--- 
      
  5.  |   | The payment of cash in lieu of fractional shares of Parent
Common Stock is solely for the purpose of avoiding the expense and
inconvenience to Parent of issuing fractional shares and does not represent
separately bargained-for consideration.  
      
  6.  |   | Following the Effective Time, the Company will hold ( _i_ ) at
least 90 percent of the fair market value of the net assets held by the
Company immediately prior to the Merger and at least 90 percent of the fair
market value of the net assets held by Merger Sub immediately prior to the
Merger and ( _ii_ ) at least 70 percent of the fair market value of the
gross assets held by the Company immediately prior to the Merger and at least
70 percent of the fair market value of the gross assets held by Merger Sub
immediately prior to the Merger. For purposes of this representation, amounts
paid by the Company or Merger Sub to dissenters, amounts paid by the Company
or by Merger Sub to shareholders who receive cash or other property
(including cash in lieu of fractional shares of Parent Common Stock), amounts
used by the Company or Merger Sub to pay expenses incurred in connection with
the Merger, amounts paid by the Company in connection with all redemptions
and amounts distributed or to be distributed (except for regular, normal
dividends), by the Company immediately preceding, in contemplation of, or
otherwise as part of an overall plan that includes the Merger, will be
considered assets held by the Company or Merger Sub, as the case may be,
immediately prior to the Effective Time.  
      
  7.  |   | No officer, director or representative of Parent or any
subsidiary of Parent had any discussions or negotiations with the Company
relating to the Merger prior to June 30, 2008.  
      
  8.  |   | At all times through the Effective Time, Parent has owned and
will own all of the stock of Merger Sub and has been and will be in "control"
of Merger Sub within the meaning of Section 368(c) of the Code.  
      
  9.  |   | At the Effective Time, neither Parent nor any person related
to Parent within the meaning of Treas. Reg. § 1.368-1(e)(3) will have any
agreement, understanding, plan or intention to redeem, purchase or otherwise
reacquire any of the Parent Common Stock to be issued to the shareholders of
the Company in the Merger or to receive the economic return on such stock.  
      
  10.  |   | Parent has, and at the Effective Time will have, no plan or
intention to ( _i_ ) liquidate the Company or otherwise cause the Company to
cease to be properly treated as a corporation for U.S. federal income tax
purposes, (ii) merge the Company with and into another entity (except with
respect to the Merger), (iii) sell or otherwise dispose of any of the stock
of the Company, except for transfers (including successive transfers) of
such stock to one or more corporations  
   

  ##### 

  

   

       |   | "controlled" (within the meaning of Section 368(c) of the
Code) by Parent or ( _iv_ ) cause the Company to sell or otherwise dispose of
any of its assets or any of the assets of Merger Sub acquired in the Merger,
except for asset dispositions made in the ordinary course of business or
asset transfers described in Section 368(a)(2)(C) of the Code or Treas. Reg.
§ 1.368-2(k).  
---|---|--- 
      
  11.  |   | Merger Sub will have no liabilities assumed by the Company
and will not transfer to the Company any assets subject to liabilities in the
Merger. Merger Sub has been newly formed solely for the purpose of engaging
in the Merger and has not engaged and will not engage in any activity other
than in respect of the Merger as contemplated by the Merger Agreement,
and has not, since its formation, owned any assets, other than assets with
nominal values, incurred any indebtedness for money borrowed, or issued stock
or any other equity to any person other than Parent. No stock of Merger Sub
will be issued in the Merger.   
      
  12.  |   | Following the Merger, members of Parents "qualified group"
will continue the Companys "historic business" or use a "significant
portion" of the Companys "historic business assets" in a business, as such
terms are used in Treas. Reg. § 1.368-1(d).  
      
  13.  |   | Parent has paid or will pay the expenses incurred by Parent
and Merger Sub in connection with the Merger and the transactions related
thereto. To the best of the knowledge of Parents management, the Company has
paid or will pay its own expenses incurred in connection with the Merger and
the transactions related thereto.  
      
  14.  |   | There is no, and at the Effective Time there will be no,
inter-corporate indebtedness existing between Parent and the Company or
between Merger Sub and the Company that was issued, was acquired, or will be
settled at a discount.   
      
  15.  |   | In the Merger, stock of the Company representing "control" of
the Company, within the meaning of Section 368(c) of the Code, will be
exchanged solely for shares of Parent Common Stock. Furthermore, no
liabilities of any Company stockholder will be assumed by Parent or
Merger Sub. For purposes of this representation, stock of the Company
exchanged in the Merger for cash or other property originating with funds
supplied by Parent or a party related to Parent will be treated as
outstanding Company stock on the date of the Merger.  
      
  16.  |   | To the best of the knowledge of Parents management, the
Company does not have, and at the Effective Time the Company will not have,
outstanding any warrants, options, convertible securities, or any other type
of right pursuant to which any person could acquire stock of the Company
that, if exercised or converted, would affect Parents acquisition or
retention of "control" of the Company, within the meaning of Section 368(c)
of the Code. Merger Sub does not have, and at the Effective Time Merger Sub
will not have, outstanding any warrants, options, convertible securities, or
any other type of right pursuant to  
   

  ##### 

  

   

       |   | which any person could acquire stock in Merger Sub, or
following the Merger, stock in Company.  
---|---|--- 
      
  17.  |   | Neither Parent nor, to the best of the knowledge of Parents
management, the Company, has or at the Effective Time will have, any plan or
intention for the Company to issue additional stock that would result in
Parent losing "control" of the Company within the meaning of Section 368(c)
of the Code.  
      
  18.  |   | Neither Parent nor any subsidiary of Parent will, directly or
indirectly through any affiliated entities, have owned, beneficially or of
record, any stock of the Company at any time during the five-year period
ending at the Effective Time.  
      
  19.  |   | Neither Parent nor Merger Sub is, or at the Effective Time
will be, an "investment company" within the meaning of Section
368(a)(2)(F)(iii) of the Code or such entity meets, and at the Effective Time
will meet, the diversification requirements of Section 368(a)(2)(F)(ii) of
the Code.  
      
  20.  |   | Neither Parent nor Merger Sub is, or at the Effective Time
will be, under the jurisdiction of a court in a Title 11 or similar case
within the meaning of Section 368(a)(3)(A) of the Code or the subject of any
other receivership, insolvency, bankruptcy or similar proceeding.  
      
  21.  |   | None of Parent, Merger Sub, or, after the Merger, the Company
will take any position on any federal, state or local income or franchise tax
return, or take any other tax reporting position that is inconsistent with
the treatment of the Merger as a reorganization within the meaning of Section
368(a) of the Code or with any of the foregoing representations,
unless otherwise required by a final "determination" (as defined in Section
1313(a)(1) of the Code) or by applicable state or local income or franchise
tax law.  
      
  22.  |   | The undersigned is authorized to make all of the statements
and representations set forth herein on behalf of Parent.  
   

  

 Parent understands and agrees that you will rely on this certificate in rendering your opinion concerning certain U.S. federal income tax consequences of the Merger. Parent hereby agrees to inform you if, for any reason, any of the foregoing representations ceases to be true prior to the Effective Time.

  |   | Re:   |   | The Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated as of [],
2009, among [Parent], [Parent] Merger Corporation and Stinger  
   

   

Ladies and Gentlemen:  

  

 This certificate is being delivered to you in connection with your rendering the tax opinions referred to in section 7.3(d) of the Agreement and Plan of Merger (the " _Merger Agreement_ "), dated as of [], 2009, among [Parent] (" _Parent_ "), [Parent] Merger Corporation (" _Merger Sub_ ") and Stinger (the " _Company_ "). Capitalized terms not defined herein have the meanings set forth in the Merger Agreement. 

  

 The Company hereby represents and certifies that the following statements are true, correct and complete as of the date hereof and will be true, correct and complete at the Effective Time: 

  

     1.  |   | The Company has entered into the Merger Agreement and
will effect the Merger for the bona fide business reasons set forth in the
Proxy Statement/Prospectus.  
---|---|--- 
      
  2.  |   | The Merger will be consummated in compliance with the terms of
the Merger Agreement and none of the material terms and conditions thereof
has been or will be waived or modified. The Merger Agreement represents the
entire understanding among Parent, Merger Sub and the Company with respect to
the Merger.  
      
  3.  |   | The consideration to be received in the Merger by the
shareholders of the Company was determined by arms length negotiations
between Parent and the Company. In connection with the Merger, shareholders
of the Company will not receive, directly or indirectly, any consideration
other than shares of Parent Common Stock and cash in lieu of fractional
shares of Parent Common Stock.  
   

  ##### 

  

   

     4.  |   | The shareholders of the Company, other than the owners
of the Class B Shares, will have no dissenters rights in the Merger.  
---|---|--- 
      
  5.  |   | The payment of cash in lieu of fractional shares of Parent
Common Stock is solely for the purpose of avoiding the expense and
inconvenience to Parent of issuing fractional shares and does not represent
separately bargained-for consideration.  
      
  6.  |   | At and immediately following the Effective Time, the Company
will hold ( _i_ ) at least 90 percent of the fair market value of the net
assets held by it immediately prior to the Merger and ( _ii_ ) at least 70
percent of the fair market value of the gross assets held by it immediately
prior to the Merger. For purposes of this representation, amounts paid by the
Company or Merger Sub to dissenters, amounts paid by the Company or by Merger
Sub to shareholders who receive cash or other property (including cash in
lieu of fractional shares of Parent Common Stock), amounts used by the
Company and Merger Sub to pay expenses incurred in connection with the
Merger, amounts paid by the Company in connection with all redemptions and
amounts distributed or to be distributed (except for regular, normal
dividends), by the Company immediately preceding, in contemplation of, or
otherwise as part of an overall plan that includes the Merger, will be
considered assets held by the Company or Merger Sub, as the case may be,
immediately prior to the Effective Time. Without limiting the foregoing, in
the last two years, there has been no share repurchase, spin-off or other
significant irregular distribution by the Company (other than the repurchase
of 275,000 shares of Common Stock during the three months ended June 30,
2008, pursuant to the stock repurchase authority granted to the Company by
its Board of Directors in April 2008, all of which took place prior to any
discussions or negotiations relating to the Merger), and, other than in the
ordinary course of business, there has been no significant debt repayment by
the Company.  
      
  7.  |   | As of the Effective Time, no assets of the Company will have
been sold, transferred or otherwise disposed of which would prevent the
Company or members of Parents "qualified group" from continuing the
Companys "historic business" and from using a "significant portion" of the
Companys "historic business assets" in a business following the Merger, as
such terms are used in Treas. Reg. § 1.368-1(d).  
      
  8.  |   | To the best of the knowledge of the Companys management,
Parent has paid or will pay the expenses incurred by Parent and Merger Sub in
connection with the Merger and the transactions related thereto. The Company
has paid or will pay its own expenses incurred in connection with the Merger
and the transactions related thereto.  
      
  9.  |   | There is no, and at the Effective Time there will be no,
inter-corporate indebtedness existing between Parent and the Company or
between Merger Sub and the Company that was issued, was acquired, or will be
settled at a discount.  
    

  ##### 

  

   

     10.  |   | In the Merger, stock of the Company representing
"control" of the Company, within the meaning of Section 368(c) of the Code,
will be exchanged solely for shares of Parent Common Stock. Furthermore, no
liabilities of any Company stockholder will be assumed by Parent or
Merger Sub. For purposes of this representation, stock of the Company
exchanged in the Merger for cash or other property originating with funds
supplied by Parent or a party related to Parent will be treated as
outstanding Company stock on the date of the Merger.  
---|---|--- 
      
  11.  |   | The Company does not have, and at the Effective Time the
Company will not have, outstanding any warrants, options, convertible
securities, or any other type of right pursuant to which any person could
acquire stock of the Company that, if exercised or converted, would
affect Parents acquisition or retention of "control" of the Company, within
the meaning of Section 368(c) of the Code.  
      
  12.  |   | The Company does not have, and at the Effective Time the
Company will not have, outstanding any capital stock (or any other interest
treated as stock for U.S. federal income tax purposes) other than the Company
Shares.  
      
  13.  |   | The Company does not have, and at the Effective Time will not
have, any plan or intention for the Company to issue additional stock that
would result in Parent losing "control" of the Company within the meaning of
Section 368(c) of the Code.  
      
  14.  |   | To the best of the knowledge of the Companys management,
neither Parent nor any subsidiary of Parent will, directly or indirectly
through any affiliated entities, have owned, beneficially or of record, any
stock of the Company at any time during the five-year period ending at the
Effective Time.  
      
  15.  |   | The Company is not, and at the Effective Time will not be, an
"investment company" within the meaning of Section 368(a)(2)(F)(iii) of the
Code or the Company meets, and at the Effective Time will meet, the
diversification requirements of Section 368(a)(2)(F)(ii) of the Code.  
      
  16.  |   | Immediately prior to the Effective Time the fair market value
of the assets of the Company will exceed the sum of its liabilities, plus the
amount of liabilities, if any, to which the assets are subject.   
      
  17.  |   | The Company is not, and at the Effective Time will not be,
under the jurisdiction of a court in a Title 11 or similar case within the
meaning of Section 368(a)(3)(A) of the Code or the subject of any other
receivership, insolvency, bankruptcy or similar proceeding.  
      
  18.  |   | The Company will not take any position on any federal, state
or local income or franchise tax return, or take any other tax reporting
position that is inconsistent with the treatment of the Merger as a
reorganization within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code or with any
of the foregoing representations, unless

  19.  |   | At the Effective Time there will be no accrued, but unpaid,
dividends on the stock of the Company.
