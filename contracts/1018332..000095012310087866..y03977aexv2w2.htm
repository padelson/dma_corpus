Purchasers obligations pursuant to the preceding sentence shall be limited to the amount accrued in respect of the 2010 Bonuses as of December 31, 2010.

 (c) Notwithstanding the foregoing, no provision of this Agreement shall (i) create any right in any employee to continued employment by Purchaser, the Company, the Transferred Companies or any respective Subsidiary thereof, or preclude the ability of Purchaser, the Company, the Transferred Companies or any respective Subsidiary thereof to terminate the employment of any employee for any reason or (ii) require Purchaser, the Company, the Transferred Companies or any respective Subsidiary thereof to continue any Employee Plan or prevent the amendment, modification, or termination thereof in accordance with plan terms after the Closing Date.

 (g) During the period from the date hereof through the Closing, the Company shall pay and discharge, or shall cause the Transferred Companies to pay and discharge (on a basis consistent with past practice), all contributions and payments under each Employee Plan and Benefit Arrangement, in all events, not later than the date each such contribution and

Purchaser shall (and Purchaser shall cause the Intel Companies to) indemnify, defend and hold harmless, and advance expenses to the DandO Indemnified Parties with respect to all acts or omissions by them in their capacities as such at any time prior to the Closing (including any matters arising in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement), to the fullest extent that the Company and the Intel Companies would be permitted by applicable Law and to the fullest extent required by the organizational documents of the Company or the Intel Companies as in effect on the date of this Agreement.

 (b) Without limiting the provisions of _Section 6.6(a)_, during the period ending on the sixth (6th) anniversary of the Closing, to the fullest extent that the Intel Companies would be permitted by applicable Law to do so, Purchaser shall (and shall cause the Intel Companies to): (i) indemnify and hold harmless each DandO Indemnified Party against and from any Losses in connection with any Proceeding, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative, to the extent such Proceeding arises out of or pertains to: (A) any action or omission or alleged action or omission taken or not taken in such DandO Indemnified Partys capacity as a director, officer, manager or employee of the Intel Companies prior to the Closing; or (B) this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby and (ii) pay in advance of the final disposition of any such Proceeding the expenses (including attorneys fees) of any DandO Indemnified Party upon receipt of an undertaking by or on behalf of such DandO Indemnified Party to repay such amount if it shall ultimately be determined that such DandO Indemnified Party is not entitled to be indemnified;  _provided_ , _however_ , that neither Purchaser nor the Intel Companies shall be liable for any 

      ##### 

  

    

settlement effected without either Purchasers or the Intel Companies prior

conditioned or delayed). Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained
in this _Section 6.6(b)_ or elsewhere in this Agreement, neither Purchaser
nor the Intel Companies shall (and Purchaser shall cause the Intel Companies
not to) settle or compromise or consent to the entry of any judgment or
otherwise seek termination with respect to any such Proceeding against a DandO
Indemnified Party, unless such settlement, compromise, consent or termination

all Liability arising out of such Proceeding.

Any indemnification and other payments by Purchaser under this _Section 6.6_ to or for any DandO Indemnified Party for Losses shall be paid net of (i) any insurance proceeds actually recovered by such DandO Indemnified Party with respect to any Losses so indemnified and (ii) any indemnity, contribution or other similar payment received by the DandO Indemnified Party from any third-party with respect to such Losses, minus the amount of reasonable out-of-pocket expenses actually incurred and necessary to recover such third-party payment. In the event that an applicable insurance or other recovery is received by any DandO Indemnified Party with respect to any indemnification payment for which he or she has been indemnified under this _Section 6.6_, then a refund equal to the aggregate amount of such applicable recovery with respect to such indemnification payment shall be made promptly to Purchaser by such DandO Indemnified Party. 

   

 (d) The DandO Indemnified Parties to whom this _Section 6.6_ applies shall be third-party beneficiaries of this _Section 6.6_.

 (e) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, this _Section 6.6_ shall survive the Closing indefinitely and shall be binding on all successors and assigns of Purchaser, and shall be enforceable by the DandO Indemnified Parties and their successors, heirs or representatives. In the event that Purchaser or the Intel Companies or any of their successors 

      ##### 

  

    

or assigns consolidates with or merges into any other Person and shall not be
the continuing or surviving Person of such consolidation or merger, or
transfers or conveys all or a majority of its properties and assets to any
Person, then, and in each such case, Purchaser shall cause proper provision
to be made so that the successors and assigns of Purchaser or the Intel
Companies shall succeed to the obligations set forth in this _Section
6.6_.

If the Estimated Net Working Capital Amount is more than one hundred and ten percent (110%) of the Target Net Working Capital, then, the Purchase Price shall be increased by an amount equal to the amount by which the Estimated Net Working Capital Amount exceeds the Target Net Working Capital. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, all payment obligations arising under the Special Employee Plan Term Sheet or the Special Employee Plan shall be excluded for the purposes of determining Net Working Capital and the Estimated Working Capital Amount.

confidential treatment will be accorded to such information (and, in any
event, if applicable, such party will reasonably cooperate with the other
party to obtain such a protective order or other assurance). For the avoidance
of doubt, disclosures made to the extent permitted by and following
compliance with this _Section 6.14_ will not constitute a breach of this

 (i) The Indemnified Party shall give the Indemnifying Party prompt written notice of any such Third-Party Claim; _provided_ , _however_ , that (A) failure to give such notification shall not affect the indemnification provided hereunder except to the extent the Indemnifying Party demonstrates that it has been materially prejudiced as a result of such failure; and (B) the Indemnifying Party shall have the right, after it acknowledges in writing to the Indemnified Party its obligation to indemnify the Indemnified Party hereunder, to undertake the defense thereof by counsel reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnified Party at the Indemnifying Partys sole expense; _provided_ , that if the Indemnifying Party assumes such defense, the Indemnified Party shall have the right to participate in the defense thereof and to employ counsel, at its own expense, separate from the counsel employed by the Indemnifying Party, it being understood that the Indemnifying Party shall control such defense; 

   

 (ii) Within thirty (30) Business Days following the receipt of notice of a Third-Party Claim, if the Indemnifying Party has not assumed the defense of such Third-Party Claim or has declined to assume the defense of such Third-Party Claim in writing, the Indemnified Party shall (upon further written notice to the Indemnifying Party) have the right to undertake the defense, compromise or settlement of such Third-Party Claim on behalf of and for the account and risk of the Indemnifying Party subject to the right of the Indemnifying Party to assume the defense of such Third-Party Claim at any time prior to settlement, compromise or final determination thereof; and 

   

 (iii) Notwithstanding any provision in this _Article IX_ to the contrary, without the prior written consent of the Indemnified Party (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed), the Indemnifying Party shall not admit any liability with respect to, or settle, compromise or discharge, any Third-Party Claim or consent to the entry of any judgment with respect thereto, except in the case of any settlement that (A) includes as an unconditional term thereof the delivery by the claimant or plaintiff to the Indemnified Party of a written unconditional release from all Liability in respect of such Third-Party Claim and (B) provides solely for monetary relief as to which the Indemnified Party shall be indemnified in full (subject to the limitations set forth in _Section 9.5_ ) and does not otherwise involve or purport to bind or limit the Indemnified Party. In addition, if the Indemnifying Party shall have assumed the defense of the Third-Party Claim, the Indemnified Party shall not admit any liability with respect to, or settle, compromise or discharge, any Third-Party Claim or consent to the entry of any judgment with respect thereto, without the prior written consent of the Indemnifying Party (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed), and the Indemnifying Party will not be subject to any liability for any such admission, settlement, compromise, discharge or consent to Judgment made by an Indemnified Party without such prior written consent of the Indemnifying Party. 

   ##### 

  

  

 (b) In the event any Indemnified Party should have a claim against any Indemnifying Party under _Section 9.2_ or _Section 9.3_ that does not involve a Third-Party Claim being asserted against or sought to be collected from such Indemnified Party, the Indemnified Party shall, as promptly as practicable after discovery of such claim, deliver written notice of such claim to the Indemnifying Party. The failure by any Indemnified Party to so notify the Indemnifying Party shall not relieve the Indemnifying Party from any Liability which it may have to such Indemnified Party under _Section 9.2_ or _Section 9.3_, except to the extent that the Indemnifying Party demonstrates that it has been materially prejudiced by such failure. 

   

 Section 9.5 _Certain Limitations and Other Indemnification Provisions_. 

  

 (a) Each of Purchaser and the Company acknowledges and agrees that, if the Closing occurs, their sole and exclusive monetary remedy (other than for fraud or knowing and intentional breach of this Agreement) following the Closing with respect to any and all claims (whether Third-Party Claims or otherwise) relating to the subject matter of this Agreement shall be pursuant to the provisions set forth in this _Article IX_, _Section 6.9_ and _Section 6.10_;  _provided_ , _however_ , that nothing contained herein shall prevent any party from pursuing non-monetary remedies as may be available to such party under applicable Law in the event of a partys failure to comply with its obligations hereunder. 

   

 (b) Any indemnification payments under this Agreement for indemnifiable Losses shall be paid net of (i) any insurance proceeds actually recovered by the Indemnified Party or its Affiliates with respect to such Losses and (ii) any indemnity, contribution or other similar payment received by the Indemnified Party or its Affiliates from any third-party with respect to such Losses, minus the amount of reasonable out-of-pocket expenses actually incurred and necessary to recover such third-party payment. In the event that an applicable insurance or other recovery is received by any Indemnified Party or its Affiliates with respect to any indemnification payment for which any such Person has been indemnified under this Agreement, then a refund equal to the aggregate amount of such applicable recovery with respect to such indemnification payment shall be made promptly to the Indemnifying Party. 

   

 Section 9.6 _Characterization of Indemnification Payments; Exclusivity of Tax Provisions_ (a) . Unless otherwise required by Law, any payment made pursuant to this  _Article IX_ shall be treated for all Tax purposes as an adjustment to the Purchase Price. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, all matters relating to indemnification in respect of Taxes shall be governed by _Section 6.9_ (except with respect to _Sections 9.2(a)_ and _9.3_ ). With respect to Tax matters, any conflict between the terms of _Section 6.9_ and any other provision of this Agreement shall be resolved in favor of _Section 6.9_ , unless such other provision expressly provides that it shall be given priority over such provisions.

This Agreement may be executed in multiple counterparts, all of which shall together be considered one and the same agreement, and shall become effective when all such counterparts have been signed by each party and delivered to the other party.

 Section 10.5 _Entire Agreement; Third-Party Beneficiaries_. This Agreement (including the Company Disclosure Schedule, the Purchaser Disclosure Schedule and the exhibits hereto, together with the other instruments referred to herein) and the Confidentiality Agreement (a) constitute the entire agreement and supersede all prior agreements and understandings, both written and oral, between the parties with respect to the subject matter hereof and (b) are not intended to confer upon any Person other than the parties hereto and their permitted successor and assigns, and nothing herein expressed or implied shall give or be construed to give to any Person, other than the parties hereto and such successors and assigns, any legal or equitable rights, remedies or claims hereunder; _provided_ , _however_ , that it is specifically intended that the DandO Indemnified Parties (with respect to _Section 6.6_ from and after the Closing) and the Indemnified Parties (with respect to _Article IX_ from and after the Closing) are third-party beneficiaries. 

  

 Section 10.6 _Severability_. If any term, provision, covenant or restriction of this Agreement is held by a court of competent jurisdiction or other authority to be invalid, void, unenforceable or against its regulatory policy, the remainder of the terms, provisions, covenants and restrictions of this Agreement shall remain in full force and effect and shall in no way be affected, impaired or invalidated. Upon such a holding by a court of competent jurisdiction, the Company and Purchaser shall negotiate in good faith to modify this Agreement so as to effect the original intent of the parties as closely as possible in a mutually acceptable manner in order that 

   ##### 

  

  

the transactions contemplated by this Agreement be carried out and construed
as originally contemplated by the parties to the greatest extent possible. 

  

 Section 10.7 _Governing Law_. This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Delaware, without giving effect to any choice or conflict of laws provision or rule (whether of the State of Delaware or any other jurisdiction) that would cause the application of the Laws of any jurisdiction other than the State of Delaware. 

  

 Section 10.8 _Jurisdiction_. Each of the parties hereto hereby (a) expressly and irrevocably submits to the exclusive personal jurisdiction of the Delaware Court of Chancery, any other court of the State of Delaware or any Federal court sitting in the State of Delaware in the event any dispute arises out of this Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, (b) agrees that it will not attempt to deny or defeat such personal jurisdiction by motion or other request for leave from any such court, (c) agrees that it will not bring any Proceeding relating to this Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement in any court other than the Delaware Court of Chancery, any other court of the State of Delaware or any Federal court sitting in the State of Delaware and (d) agrees that the other party shall have the right to bring any Proceeding for enforcement of a judgment entered by the Delaware Court of Chancery, any other court of the State of Delaware or any Federal court sitting in the State of Delaware. Each of Purchaser and the Company agrees that a final judgment in any Proceeding shall be conclusive and may be enforced in other jurisdictions by suit on the judgment or in any other manner provided by Law. 

  

 Section 10.9 _Service of Process_. Each party irrevocably consents to the service of process outside the territorial jurisdiction of the courts referred to in _Section 10.8_ in any such action or proceeding by mailing copies thereof by registered or certified United States mail, postage prepaid, return receipt requested, to its address as specified in or pursuant to  _Section 10.2_. However, the foregoing shall not limit the right of a party to effect service of process on the other party by any other legally available method. 

  

 Section 10.10 _Waiver of Jury Trial_. EACH OF PURCHASER AND THE COMPANY HEREBY IRREVOCABLY WAIVES ALL RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY ACTION, PROCEEDING OR COUNTERCLAIM (WHETHER BASED ON CONTRACT, TORT OR OTHERWISE) ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY OR THE ACTIONS OF PURCHASER OR THE COMPANY IN THE NEGOTIATION, ADMINISTRATION, PERFORMANCE AND ENFORCEMENT OF THIS AGREEMENT. 

  

 Section 10.11 _Specific Performance_. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement, the parties agree that immediate, extensive and irreparable damage would occur for which monetary damages would not be an adequate remedy in the event that any of the provisions of this Agreement are not performed in accordance with their specific terms or are otherwise breached. Accordingly, the parties agree that, if for any reason Purchaser or the Company shall have failed to perform its obligations under this Agreement, then the party seeking to enforce this Agreement against such nonperforming party under this Agreement shall be entitled to specific performance and the issuance of immediate injunctive and other equitable relief without the necessity of proving the inadequacy of money damages as a remedy, and the parties further agree 

   ##### 

  

 

to waive any requirement for the securing or posting of any bond in connection
with the obtaining of any such injunctive or other equitable relief, this
being in addition to and not in limitation of any other remedy to which they
are entitled at Law or in equity. Without limiting the foregoing, each of the
parties hereby acknowledges and agrees that it may be difficult to
prove damages with reasonable certainty, that it may be difficult to procure
suitable substitute performance, and that injunctive relief and/or specific
performance will not cause an undue hardship to the parties. Each of the
parties hereby further acknowledges and agrees that the existence of any
other remedy contemplated by this Agreement shall not diminish the
availability of specific performance of the obligations hereunder or any
other injunctive relief and agrees that in the event of any action by the
other party for specific performance or injunctive relief, it will not assert
that a remedy at Law or other remedy would be adequate or that specific
performance or injunctive relief in respect of such breach or violation
should not be available on the grounds that money damages are adequate or any
other grounds. Any such remedies, and any and all other remedies provided for
in this Agreement, shall be cumulative in nature and not exclusive and
shall be in addition to any other remedies whatsoever which any party may
otherwise have. 

   

 Section 10.12 _Assignment_. Neither this Agreement nor any of the rights, interests or obligations hereunder shall be assigned by either party hereto (whether by operation of law or in connection with a merger or sale of substantially all the assets, stock or membership interests of such party) without the prior written consent of the other party. Subject to the preceding sentence, this Agreement will apply to, be binding in all respects upon and inure to the benefit of and be enforceable by the parties and their respective permitted successors and assigns. 

  

 Section 10.13 _Expenses_. All costs and expenses incurred in connection with the preparation, negotiation, execution and performance of this Agreement and the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby shall be paid by the party incurring such costs and expenses, whether or not the transactions contemplated hereby are consummated, _provided_ that Purchaser shall pay all costs and expenses in connection with the filings of the notification and report forms under the HSR Act in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the notice to CFIUS of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement pursuant to Exon-Florio. 

  

 Section 10.14 _Waivers_. Except as otherwise provided in this Agreement, any failure of either party to comply with any obligation, covenant, agreement or condition herein may be waived by the party entitled to the benefits thereof only by a written instrument signed by the party expressly granting such waiver, but such waiver or failure to insist upon strict compliance with such obligation, covenant, agreement or condition shall not operate as a waiver of, or estoppel with respect to, any subsequent or other failure.

         ##### 

  

     

 IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the Company and Purchaser have caused this Agreement to be signed by their respective officers thereunto duly authorized as of the date first written above.
