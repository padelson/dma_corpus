Sellers Representative or, if Buyer and the Sellers Representative cannot
agree on an accounting firm within thirty (30) days after timely delivery of a
Notice of Disagreement, each of Buyer and the Sellers Representative shall
select a nationally recognized accounting firm and such two accounting firms
shall designate a third nationally recognized accounting firm that neither

Representative shall instruct the Accounting Firm to select one of its
partners experienced in purchase price adjustment disputes to make a final
determination of the Closing Date Cash and the Net Working Capital calculated
with reference to the items that are in dispute as set forth in the Notice of
Disagreement. Buyer and the Sellers Representative shall instruct the
Accounting Firm that, in resolving the items in the Notice of Disagreement
that are still in dispute and in determining the Closing Date Cash and the

dispute a value that is (A) greater than the greatest value for such item

accordance with the guidelines and procedures set forth in this Agreement) and
at the Accounting Firms discretion a one-day conference concerning the
dispute, at which conference each of Buyer and the Sellers Representative
shall have the right to present their respective positions with respect to the
dispute and have present their respective advisors, counsel and accountants,

Representative (which final resolution shall be requested by Buyer and the
Sellers Representative to be delivered not more than thirty (30) days
following submission of such disputed matters to the Accounting Firm),
which shall be final, conclusive and binding on the Parties with respect to
the Closing Date Cash and the Net Working Capital, absent manifest error, and
(iv) provide a written report to Buyer and the Sellers Representative, if
requested by either of them, which sets forth in reasonable detail the basis
for the Accounting Firms final determination. The fees and expenses of the
Accounting Firm shall be allocated between Buyer, on the one hand, and the
Equity Holders based upon their Pro Rata Percentages, on the other hand,
based upon the percentage by which the portion of the contested amount not
awarded to each of Buyer and the Sellers Representative bears to the amount
actually contested by such Party.

 

(e) The Preliminary Closing Statement shall be deemed final for the purposes
of this _Section 2.8_ upon the earliest of (i) the failure of the Sellers

2.8(h)_. 

(g) All payments required under this _Section 2.8_ shall be made in cash by
wire transfer of immediately available funds to such bank account(s) as shall
be designated in writing by the recipient(s) at least three (3) Business Days
prior to the applicable payment date.

(h) Any payment that is to be made pursuant to _Section 2.8(f)(ii)(B)_ to an
Equity Holder and that is attributable to an Option shall be treated for Tax
purposes as a payment, when and if made, of compensation for services and,
accordingly, Buyer shall reduce, or shall cause the Company to reduce, each
such payment by the amount of any required federal, foreign, provincial,
state, or local withholding Taxes payable by the Company with respect to such

Section 5.3 _Consents and Approvals; No Violations_. Except for applicable
requirements of the HSR Act, neither the execution and delivery of this

the obtaining of any permit, authorization, consent or approval of, any
Governmental Entity, (c) violate, conflict with or result in a default (or any

evidence of indebtedness, guarantee, license, agreement, lease or other
contract, instrument or obligation to which Buyer is a party or by which

-39-  Section 5.4 _Litigation_. There is no claim, action, suit, proceeding
or governmental investigation pending or, to the knowledge of Buyer,

ability to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or the
Escrow Agreement.

Section 5.5 _Financial Capability_. Attached hereto as _Exhibit 5.5_ is a true
and complete copy of an executed financing commitment letter (" _Commitment
Letter_ "), pursuant to which the lender party thereto has agreed, upon the
terms and subject to the conditions thereof, to lend the amounts set forth
therein for the purposes of financing the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement and related fees and expenses (such financing, and any other debt
financing in substitution thereof pursuant to _Section 6.9_ hereof, the "
_Financing_ "). The Commitment Letter has not been amended, restated or
otherwise modified or waived prior to the date of this Agreement, and the
commitments contained in the Commitment Letter have not been withdrawn,
modified or rescinded in any respect prior to the date of this Agreement. The
Commitment Letter is in full force and effect and constitutes the legal,

the other parties thereto. There are no conditions precedent or contingencies
related to the funding of the full amount of the Financing, other than as
expressly set forth in the Commitment Letter, and there are no side letters

Buyers obligations under this Agreement, including (i) the payment of the
aggregate Purchase Price and any other amounts required to be paid pursuant to
_Article II_ , and (ii) the payment of all fees and expenses and other payment

Agreement, (A) no event has occurred which would constitute a breach or
default (or an event which with notice or lapse of time or both would
constitute a default), in each case, on the part of Buyer under the Commitment
Letter or, to the knowledge of Buyer, any other party to the Commitment
Letter, and (B) subject to the satisfaction of the conditions contained in
_Section 7.1_, _Section 7.2_ and _Section 7.3_ hereof, Buyer does not have
any reason to believe that any of the conditions to the Financing will not be
satisfied or that the Financing or any other funds necessary for the
satisfaction of all of Buyers obligations under this Agreement will not be
available to Buyer at the Closing. As of the date of this Agreement, Buyer is
not aware of any fact or occurrence that makes any of the assumptions, or the
representations or warranties of Buyer, in the Commitment Letter inaccurate in
any material respect. Buyer has fully paid all commitment fees or other fees,
if any, required to be paid prior to the date of this Agreement pursuant to
the Commitment Letter.

 



-40-  Section 5.6 _Solvency_. Immediately after giving effect to the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, the Buyer and the Company, shall

present or future creditors of any of the Buyer and its subsidiaries,
including the Company.

Section 5.7 _Certain Fees_. Neither the Company nor any Equity Holder shall be
directly or indirectly obligated to pay or bear ( _e.g.,_ by virtue of any
payment by or obligation of any of Buyer or any of its Affiliates at or at
any time after the Closing) any brokerage, finders or other fee or commission
to any broker, finder or investment banker in connection with the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement based on arrangements made by or on behalf of
Buyer or any of its Affiliates.

Section 5.8 _Subscription Agreements_. Attached hereto as _Exhibit 4.8_ are

ARTICLE VI

Section 6.1 _Conduct of the Business_. The Company and the Stockholders agree

the Company (i) will use its commercially reasonable efforts to (a) conduct
its business in the Ordinary Course in all material respects and (b) maintain,
preserve and retain in all material respects relationships with
those customers, common carrier subcontractors, suppliers or vendors that are

Section 6.2 _Commercially Reasonable Efforts; Consents_.

 

(a) Each of the Parties shall cooperate, and use their respective commercially
reasonable efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all action, and to do, or
cause to be done, all things necessary under applicable Laws to consummate the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement as promptly as practicable after
the date hereof, including obtaining all licenses, permits,
consents, approvals, authorizations, qualifications and orders of
Governmental Entities and other third parties necessary to consummate the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Buyer shall pay all filing fees
under the HSR Act, and neither the Company nor the

 



-41-   Stockholders shall be required to pay any fees or other payments to any
Governmental Entity in connection with any filings under the HSR Act or such
other filings as may be required under applicable Laws. In addition to the
foregoing, Buyer agrees to provide such assurances as to financial capability,
resources and creditworthiness (at no cost or expense to Buyer) as may be
reasonably requested by any third party whose consent or approval is sought
in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby.

(b) Each Party will promptly after execution of this Agreement (but in no
event later than five (5) Business Days after the date hereof) make all
filings or submissions as are required under the HSR Act. Each Party will
promptly furnish to the other such necessary information and
reasonable assistance as the other may request in connection with its
preparation of any filing or submission that is necessary under the HSR Act.
Each Party will promptly provide the other with copies of all written
communications (and memoranda setting forth the substance of all oral
communications) between each of them, any of their Affiliates or any of its or
their representatives, on the one hand, and any Governmental Entity, on the
other hand, with respect to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated
hereby. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, each Party will
promptly notify the other of the receipt and content of any inquiries or
requests for additional information made by any Governmental Entity in
connection therewith and will promptly (i) comply with any such inquiry or
request and (ii) provide the other with a description of the information
provided to any Governmental Entity with respect to any such inquiry or
request. In addition, each Party will keep the other apprised on a prompt
basis of the status of any such inquiry or request.

(c) No Party shall take any action intentionally designed to adversely affect
the approval of any Governmental Entity of any of the aforementioned filings.
The Parties further covenant and agree, with respect to a threatened or
pending preliminary or permanent injunction or other order, decree or ruling
or statute, rule, regulation or executive order that would adversely affect
the ability of the Parties to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby,
to use commercially reasonable efforts to prevent or lift the entry,
enactment or promulgation thereof, as the case may be.

(d) Each Party shall cooperate in good faith with all Governmental Entities
and shall undertake promptly any and all action required to complete lawfully,
and as soon as possible, the transactions contemplated by this Agreement,
including: (i) proffering and consenting to a governmental order providing
for the sale or other disposition, or the holding separate, of particular
assets, categories of assets or lines of business, of either assets or lines
of business of the Company or of any other assets or lines of business of
Buyer or any of its Affiliates in order to remedy any concerns that any
Governmental Entity may have, (ii) terminating, relinquishing, modifying or
waiving existing relationships, ventures, contractual rights, obligations or
other arrangements of Buyer, the Company or their respective Subsidiaries or
Affiliates, (iii) creating any relationships, ventures, contractual rights,
obligations or other arrangements of Buyer, the Company or their respective
Subsidiaries or Affiliates or (iv) proffering and consenting to any other
restriction, prohibition or limitation on any of the assets of the Company,
Buyer or any of Buyers Affiliates, in order to remedy any such concerns
(clauses (i)  (iv) collectively, " _Divestiture Actions_ "). If any
objections are asserted with respect to the transactions contemplated hereby
under any Law relating to regulatory matters or if any action or proceeding,
whether judicial or administrative, is instituted by any Governmental Entity
or any private party

 



-42-   challenging the transactions contemplated hereby as violative of any Law
relating to regulatory matters, each of the Parties shall cooperate with one
another and use reasonable best efforts to: (A) oppose or defend against any
action to prevent or enjoin consummation of the transactions contemplated
hereby and (B) take such action as necessary to overturn any action by any
Governmental Entity or private party to block consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby, including by defending any action or
proceeding brought by any Governmental Entity or private party in order to
avoid entry of, or to have vacated, overturned or terminated, including by
appeal if necessary, any decree, judgment, injunction or other order (whether
temporary, preliminary or permanent) that would restrain, prevent or delay the
transactions contemplated hereby, or in order to resolve any such objections
or challenge as such Governmental Entity or private party may have to such
transactions under such Laws so as to permit consummation of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to
the contrary, nothing in this Agreement shall require, or be deemed to
require, Buyer to take or agree to take any Divestiture Action if doing so
would, individually or in the aggregate, (1) be material to the business,
operations and/or assets of the Buyer or its Subsidiaries or (2) be expected
to result in a loss (other than an immaterial loss) of the reasonably expected
benefits to Buyer of the transactions contemplated hereby.

Section 6.3 _Public Announcements_. Except as otherwise required by Law or
stock exchange requirements, none of the Parties shall, and each Party shall
cause its Affiliates (including the Company, prior to the Closing) not to,
make or issue any public announcement or press release to the general public
with respect to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement without the prior written consent of the other parties, which
consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, following the execution of this Agreement,
Buyer shall be permitted to issue a press release in substantially the form
presented to the Stockholders prior to the date hereof (together with such
revisions as may be reasonably made by Buyer), and also shall be permitted to
make such other public announcements (other than press releases and similar
announcements) as it deems appropriate, including as required by Law.

Section 6.4 _Supplemental Disclosure_. The Stockholders and the Company shall
promptly, from time to time prior to or at the Closing, supplement, amend or
create any Schedule in order to add information to reflect any fact or
condition occurring after the date hereof that would cause a breach of a
representation or warranty if made as of the date of such fact or condition
(the " _Supplement_ "); _provided_ , _however_ , that in no event shall any
Supplement be made with respect to any event or set of circumstances that
occurred or existed prior to the date hereof. Except as explicitly set forth
in this Agreement, any such Supplement shall be effective to cure and correct
any breach of any representation, warranty or covenant that would have existed
if the Company or any Stockholder had not made such Supplement, and all
references to any Schedule hereto that is supplemented or amended as provided
in this _Section 6.4_ shall for all purposes after the Closing be deemed to
be a reference to such Schedule as so supplemented or amended.

 



-43-  Section 6.5 _Tax Matters_.

 

(a) _Tax Returns_. All Tax Returns to be filed on or prior to the Closing Date
shall be provided to Buyer for its review and comment prior to filing and all
of Buyers reasonable comments shall be accepted. Buyer shall, at its own
expense, prepare or cause to be prepared and timely file or cause to be timely
filed all Tax Returns of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries for all
periods that have not yet been filed and are required to be filed after the
Closing Date. Buyer shall prepare any such Tax Returns with respect to taxable
periods or portions thereof ending on or before the Closing Date (such
periods, including all taxable periods ending on or before the Closing Date,
" _Pre-Closing Tax Periods_ ") consistent with past practices of each of the
Company and the Company Subsidiaries, and the Equity Holders shall be
responsible for the Taxes of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries for
Pre-Closing Tax Periods (" _Pre-Closing Taxes_ ") due in respect of such Tax
Returns. Buyer shall permit the Sellers Representative to review and comment
on each Tax Return described in the preceding sentence and shall make such
revisions to such Tax Returns as are reasonably requested by the Sellers
Representative. Buyer shall notify the Sellers Representative of any amounts
due from the Equity Holders in respect of any such Tax Return no later than
ten (10) Business Days prior to the date on which such Tax Return is due, and
the Sellers Representative shall remit such payment to Buyer no later than
five (5) Business Days prior to the date such Tax Return is due. Buyer shall
cause any amounts shown to be due on such Tax Returns to be timely remitted to
the applicable Governmental Entity no later than the date on which such Taxes
are due.

 

(b) In the case of any taxable period that includes (but does not end on) the
Closing Date (a " _Straddle Period_ "), the amount of any Taxes (other than
property or ad valorem Taxes) for the portion of such Straddle Period ending
on the Closing Date shall be determined based on an interim closing of the
books as of the close of business on the Closing Date. In the case of any
property or ad valorem Taxes that are payable for a Straddle Period, the
portion of such Tax which relates to the portion of such Straddle Period
ending on the Closing Date shall be deemed to be the amount of such Tax for
the entire Straddle Period multiplied by a fraction the numerator of which is
the number of days in the Straddle Period ending on the Closing Date and the
denominator of which is the number of days in the entire Straddle Period. Any
Transaction Deductions for any Straddle Period shall be deemed to relate to
the portion of such Straddle Period ending on the Closing Date.

(c) To the extent permitted by Law and IRS guidance, the Transaction
Deductions shall be reported on applicable income Tax Returns solely as income
tax deductions of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries for the Tax year
that includes the Closing Date and shall not be treated or reported as income
tax deductions for a year or period beginning after the Closing Date
(including under Treasury Regulation Section 1.1502-76(b)(1)(ii)(B) or any
comparable or similar provision under state or local Law), and the
Transaction Deductions shall be calculated utilizing the safe harbor set forth
in Revenue Procedure 2011-29. Buyer shall provide the Sellers Representative
with a copy of each such income Tax Return for review and comment not later
than thirty (30) days prior to its due date (including extensions). The
Sellers Representative shall review and comment on such Tax Returns within
fifteen (15) days of receipt thereof. If the Sellers Representative does not
submit comments within such period, then the Sellers Representative will be
deemed to have approved such Tax Returns as prepared by Buyer, and Buyer will
file such Tax Returns promptly. If the Sellers Representative delivers 

 



-44-   comments to Buyer within such period, the Sellers Representative and Buyer
shall use good faith efforts to resolve any dispute in connection with such
comments. In the event Buyer and the Sellers Representative are unable to
agree on any such revisions within fifteen (15) days after the Sellers
Representative provides its comments, Buyer and the Sellers Representative
shall engage the Accounting Firm to resolve the dispute, the costs of which
shall be borne equally by the Equity Holders on the one hand, and Buyer on the
other hand. Upon the final determination of such dispute, Buyer shall file or
cause to be filed such Tax Returns promptly but no later than five (5)
Business Days after such final determination. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary in this _Section 6.5(c)_, Buyer shall be entitled to file, or cause
to be filed, the applicable Tax Return without having incorporated the
disagreed upon changes to avoid a late filing of such Tax Return. In the event
the independent public accounting firms resolution of the dispute
necessitates that a Tax Return filed in accordance with the previous sentence
be amended, Buyer shall cause an amended Tax Return to be filed that reflects
such resolution.

(d) To the extent that the Company has paid estimated income Taxes for the
Tax year ending on or including the Closing Date and the amount of the
estimated income Taxes which were paid prior to the Closing Date exceeds the
amount of the income Tax liability with respect to such Pre-Closing Tax
Period (taking into account any allowed Transaction Deductions for such year
to the extent permitted by Law and IRS guidelines), Buyer shall prepare or
cause to be prepared, at the expense of the Equity Holders, IRS Form
4466 (Corporation Application for Quick Refund of Overpayment of Estimated
Tax) with IRS Form 8302 (Electronic Deposit of Tax Refund of $1 Million or
More) and any analogous application for a state refund of an overpayment of
estimated state income Taxes with respect to such Tax year. Any such refund
application shall be treated as an income Tax Return that is subject to
analogous review, comment, dispute resolution and filing procedures to those
set forth in _Section 6.5(c)_. Within five (5) Business Days of the receipt
from the applicable Governmental Entity of a refund as a result of such a
refund application, Buyer shall pay an amount equal to such refund to the
Sellers Representative (on behalf of the Equity Holders). If the amount of
the refunds received from the applicable Governmental Entity (and paid over to
the Sellers Representative in accordance with the previous sentence) is
different than the amount of the refunds that are actually determined to
be due upon filing the applicable income Tax Return including following the
audit of such Tax Return, an appropriate payment (including the excess refund
paid, plus the amount of any interest or penalties required to be paid, to the
Governmental Entity) shall be made from the Sellers Representative to the
Buyer, in the event that such amount is owed by the Equity Holders, or by
Buyer to the Sellers Representative for further distribution to the Equity
Holders, in the event that such amount is owed by the Buyer, in each case
within five (5) Business Days of filing such income Tax Return or the ultimate
determination of the proper amount of such refund. Any amounts that are
finally determined to be owed to the Equity Holders pursuant to _Section
6.5(d)  (g)_ that are attributable to an Option shall, as determined by the
Sellers Representative, be paid to the Company on behalf of the Option
Holders and distributed, subject to applicable withholding Taxes, to the
Option Holders in the same manner as provided for in _Section 2.8(f)(ii)(B)_.

(e) To the extent (x) any Transaction Deductions are not properly deductible
in the Tax year that ends on or includes the Closing Date and are properly
deductible in a Tax year beginning after the Closing Date by the Buyer or any
of its Affiliates (including the Company, the Company Subsidiaries or any of
their successors), or (y) after the application of _Section_ _6.5(d)_ ,

 



-45-   the Company has a net operating loss carryforward that is attributable to
the Transaction Deductions (a " _Carryforward_ "), then Buyer shall pay to the
Sellers Representative (on behalf of the Equity Holders) an amount equal to
the amount by which (i) the amount of Taxes that the Buyer or the Company (or
their respective successors) would have been required to pay for a Tax period
ending on or prior to December 31, 2017 but for the deduction or the
Carryforward of the Transaction Deductions, as applicable, exceeds (ii) the
amount of Taxes actually payable by the Buyer or the Company (or their
respective successors) with respect to any such Tax period ending on or
before December 31, 2017, which amount shall be paid only upon an actual
reduction of Taxes paid by the Buyer or its Affiliates, and shall be paid
within five (5) days of the filing of the Tax Return reflecting such reduced
Tax payment as set forth in _Section 6.5(f)_ below. For the avoidance of
doubt, a payment shall only be required where an actual Tax payment is reduced
and not when a Tax benefit is created (including, without
limitation, creation or increase of any net operating loss). For purposes of
calculating item (i) of the previous sentence, a net operating loss
carryforward allowed as a deduction shall be deemed to be attributable to
Transaction Deductions to the greatest extent possible in the earliest year
possible, and the calculation of the amount of Taxes that would have been owed
in a Tax year will not take into account any net operating loss carryforwards
that are not allowed as deductions in such year (including, for the avoidance
of doubt, carryforwards that would have been allowed but for the Transaction
Deductions or the Carryforward).

(f) Buyer shall make such payments within five (5) Business Days of filing the
applicable Tax Returns for each such Tax year to the extent of the excess for
such Tax year.

 

(g) _Other Tax Refunds_. In addition to any refunds received pursuant to
_Section 6.5(d)_, _Section 6.5(e)_ and/or _Section 6.5(f)_ Buyer shall
also pay to the Sellers Representative (on behalf of the Equity Holders) any
other refunds of Taxes of the Company or the Company Subsidiaries that relate
to Pre-Closing Tax Periods, other than any refunds that are attributable to
any carryback of net operating losses, capital losses or other Tax attributes
(in each case, to the extent not attributable to the Transaction Deductions)
attributable to a Tax period or portion thereof beginning after the Closing
Date. For the avoidance of doubt, nothing contained herein shall be construed
to provide the Equity Holders any benefit arising from any net operating loss
for a Pre-Closing Tax Period or a period commencing after the Closing Date
other than directly attributable to the Transaction Deductions. At the expense
of the Equity Holders, Buyer shall use commercially reasonable efforts to
pursue any claims for refund of the Company pending as of the Closing Date.
Buyer shall make payment of any such refund described in this _Section
6.5(g)_ to the Sellers Representative within five (5) Business Days of
receipt of the refund.

(h) _Amendment of Tax Returns_. Neither Buyer nor any of its Affiliates shall
amend, refile, revoke or otherwise modify any Tax Return or Tax election of
the Company or the Company Subsidiaries with respect to a Pre-Closing Tax
Period without the prior written consent of the Sellers Representative, which
consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed.

(i) _Closing Date Course of Business_. For the portion of the Closing Date
after the time of Closing, other than transactions expressly contemplated
hereby, Buyer shall cause the Company and the Company Subsidiaries to carry
on business only in the Ordinary Course.

 



-46-  (j) _No Section 338 Election_. Buyer shall not cause or permit an election
under Section 338 of the Code to be made with respect to the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement.

(k) _Certain Taxes_. All transfer, documentary, sales, use, stamp,
registration and other such Taxes and fees (including any penalties and
interest) incurred in connection with this Agreement shall be paid by Buyer
when due, and Buyer will, at its own expense, file all necessary Tax Returns
and other documentation with respect to all such transfer, documentary, sales,
use, stamp, registration and other Taxes and fees, and, if required by
applicable Law, Stockholders will, and will cause their Affiliates to, join
in the execution of any such Tax Returns and other documentation.

(l) _Preservation of Records_. Except as otherwise provided in this
Agreement, Buyer agrees that it shall, and it shall cause the Company and the
Company Subsidiaries to, (i) preserve and keep the records (including all Tax
and accounting records) of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries for a
period of seven (7) years from the Closing, or for any longer periods as may
be required by any Governmental Entity or ongoing litigation, and (ii) make
such records available to the Stockholders or the Sellers Representative as
may be reasonably required by the Stockholders or the Sellers Representative.
If Buyer or the Company wishes to destroy such records after the time
specified above, Buyer shall first give sixty (60) days prior written notice
to the Stockholders and the Sellers Representative and the Stockholders and
the Sellers Representative shall have the right at their respective option
and expense, upon prior written notice given to Buyer within that sixty
(60)-day period, to take possession of the records within ninety (90) days
after the date of such Stockholders or Sellers Representatives notice to
Buyer.

 

Section 6.6 _Directors  and Officers Indemnification_.

 

(a) Buyer agrees that (i) the governing documents of the Company and the
Company Subsidiaries immediately after the Closing shall contain provisions
with respect to indemnification, exculpation from liability and advancement of
expenses that are at least as favorable to the beneficiaries of such
provisions as those provisions that are set forth in the governing documents
of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries, respectively, on the date of
this Agreement, which provisions shall not be amended, repealed or otherwise
modified for a period of six (6) years following the Closing in any manner
that would adversely affect the rights thereunder of Persons who at or prior
to the Closing were directors, officers, managers, employees or agents of the
Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries, unless such modification is
required by Law and (ii) all rights to indemnification as provided in any
indemnification agreements with any current or former directors, officers,
managers, employees and agents of the Company or any of the Company
Subsidiaries as in effect as of the date hereof with respect to
matters occurring at or prior to the Closing shall survive the Closing.

(b) Buyer will pay at the Closing (pursuant to  _Section 2.4(vi))_ an amount
sufficient to enable the Company to purchase "tail" coverage through its
current insurance broker for (i) DandO insurance for a period of (6) years
following the Closing Date, and (ii) Miscellaneous Professional Liability
insurance (including employment practice liability insurance) for a period of
(3) years following the Closing Date, in each case for the benefit of the
directors, officers, 

 



-47-   managers, employees and agents of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries
and with terms and conditions substantially similar to the insurance coverage
as of the date hereof; _provided_ , that Buyer shall not be obligated to pay
more than $150,000 of the cost of such insurance. The amount payable by Buyer
under this _Section 6.6(b)_ shall be referred to as the " _Tail Premium_."

 

(c) In the event Buyer or the Company or any of their respective Subsidiaries,
successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any other Person
and is not the continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such
consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers all or substantially all of its
properties and assets to any Person, Buyer shall ensure that proper
provisions shall be made so that the successors and assigns of Buyer, the
Company or their respective subsidiaries (as applicable) assume the
obligations set forth in this _Section 6.6_.

 

(d) This _Section 6.6_, which shall survive the Closing and shall continue

provisions of this _Section 6.6_ (whether or not parties to this Agreement).

Section 6.7 _Termination of Agreements_. The Company shall take all actions
necessary to terminate the Management Agreement and the Shareholders
Agreement at or prior to the Closing in a manner such that the Company does
not have any liability or obligation following the Closing pursuant to such

an hourly basis or (iii) retained or employed on a part-time basis. 

(a) On and after the Closing Date, to the extent permitted by applicable law,
(i) Buyer will cause the benefit plans applicable to the Continued Employees
to recognize all previous service with the Company or its Subsidiaries for the
purpose of determining eligibility for and entitlement to succeeding benefits,
including vesting (provided that service with the Company or its Subsidiaries
shall not be counted for purposes of benefit accrual under any pension plan of
Buyer), and (ii) Buyer shall cause its group health plan to recognize any
costs or expenses incurred by the Continued Employees (and their dependents

COBRA.

(a) Buyer shall use its reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken,
all actions and to do, or cause to be done, all things necessary, proper or

described in the Commitment Letter, including using reasonable best efforts to

agreements with respect thereto on terms and conditions contemplated by the
Commitment Letter and execute and deliver to the Company a copy thereof
concurrently with such execution, (iii) satisfy on a timely basis all
conditions applicable to Buyer in the Commitment Letter and the definitive
agreements for the Financing and comply with its obligations thereunder, (iv)
consummate the Financing contemplated by the Commitment Letter at or prior to
the Closing, including using its reasonable best efforts to satisfy the
conditions to funding of the Financing and to instruct the lender and the
other persons providing such Financing to provide such Financing upon
satisfaction of such conditions, and (v) enforce its rights under the
Commitment Letter in the event of a breach by the financing sources that
impedes or delays the Closing, including seeking specific performance of the
parties thereunder. If all conditions to the lenders obligations under the
Commitment Letter have been satisfied or, upon funding will be satisfied,
Buyer shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause the lenders and the other
Persons providing such Financing to fund on the Closing Date, the Financing
required to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
(including by taking enforcement action, including seeking specific
performance, to cause such lenders and the other Persons providing such
Financing to fund such Financing). Buyer shall have the right from time to
time to amend, replace, supplement or otherwise modify, or waive any of its
rights under, the Commitment Letter and/or substitute other financing for all
or any portion of the Financing from the same and/or alternative financing
sources; provided that any such amendment, replacement, supplement or other
modification to or waiver of any provision of the Commitment Letter that
amends the Financing and/or substitution of all or any portion of the
Financing shall not (A) expand upon the conditions precedent or contingencies
to the Financing as set forth in the Commitment Letter or (B) prevent or
impede or delay the Closing. Buyer shall refrain from taking, directly or
indirectly, any action that would reasonably be expected to result in a
failure of any of the conditions contained in the Commitment Letter or in any
definitive agreement related to the Financing. Buyer shall keep the Company
informed on a current basis of the status of its efforts to arrange the
Financing, including Buyers attempts to substitute other debt or equity
financing for all or any part of the Financing contemplated by the Commitment
Letter.

 

(b) If any portion of the Financing becomes unavailable or Buyer becomes aware
of any event or circumstance that makes any portion of the Financing
unavailable, in each case, on the terms and conditions contemplated in the
Commitment Letter, Buyer shall promptly notify the Company and Buyer shall use
its reasonable best efforts to arrange and obtain alternative financing
from alternative financial institutions in an amount sufficient to consummate
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement as promptly as practicable
following the occurrence of such event. Buyer shall deliver to the Company
true and complete copies of all agreements pursuant to which any such
alternative source shall have committed to provide Buyer with any portion of
the Financing concurrently with the execution thereof.

 



-49-  (c) Buyer shall give the Company prompt written notice (i) of any material
breach by any party to the Commitment Letter or of any condition which will
not be satisfied, in each case, of which Buyer becomes aware or any
termination of the Commitment Letter, (ii) of the receipt of any written
notice or other written communication from any Financing source with respect
to any (A) actual or potential breach, default, termination or repudiation by
any party to any of the Commitment Letter or definitive agreements related to
the Financing of any provisions of the Commitment Letter or definitive
agreements related to the Financing or (B) material dispute or disagreement
between or among any parties to any of the Commitment Letter or definitive
agreements related to the Financing with respect to the obligation to fund
the Financing or the amount of the Financing to be funded at the Closing, and
(iii) if at any time for any reason Buyer believes in good faith that it will
not be able to obtain all or any portion of the Financing on the terms
and conditions, in the manner or from the sources contemplated by any of the
Commitment Letter or definitive agreements related to the Financing.

(d) If a Commitment Letter is amended, replaced, supplemented or otherwise
modified, including as a result of obtaining alternative financing in
accordance with _Section 6.9(b)_, or if Buyer substitutes other debt or
equity financing for all or a portion of the Financing, Buyer shall comply
with its covenants in _Section 6.9(a)_, _Section 6.9(b)_ and _Section
6.9(c)_ with respect to the Commitment Letter as so amended, replaced,
supplemented or otherwise modified and with respect to such other financing to
the same extent that Buyer would have been obligated to comply with respect to
the Financing.

 

(e) Prior to the Closing and at Buyers sole expense, the Company and the
Stockholders will provide commercially reasonable cooperation in connection
with the arrangement of the Financing contemplated by the Commitment Letter or
Buyers other financing efforts including using commercially reasonable
efforts in respect of the following: (i) to cause the Companys senior
officers and other representatives to participate in meetings, presentations,
road shows and due diligence sessions; (ii) to assist with the preparation of
appropriate and customary materials for rating agency presentations, bank
information memoranda and similar documents reasonably required in connection
with the Financing or Buyers other financing efforts; (iii) to assist with
the preparation and delivery of any pledge and security documents, any loan
agreement, currency or interest hedging agreement, other definitive financing
documents or other certificates, legal opinions or documents as may be
reasonably requested by Buyer; (iv) to facilitate the pledging of collateral,
including a customary field exam, collateral analysis, and perfection
procedures; (v) to furnish on a confidential basis to Buyer and their
financing source, as promptly as practicable, financial and other pertinent
information regarding the Company and the Company Subsidiaries as may be
reasonably requested by Buyer, including financial data required by the
documents used in connection with the Financing or Buyers other financing
efforts; and (vi) to authorize the Companys independent accountants to
cooperate with and assist Buyer in preparing customary and appropriate
information packages as the parties participating in the Financing or Buyers
other financing efforts may reasonably request for use in connection with the
syndication of debt securities, loan participations and other matters for
purposes of the Financing or Buyers other financing efforts; provided that
nothing in this Agreement shall require such cooperation to the extent if
would, in the Companys

 



-50-   reasonable judgment, interfere unreasonably with the business or operations
of the Company. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Buyer acknowledges and agrees
that neither the Company, any Company Subsidiary or any of their respective
Affiliates or representatives shall have any responsibility for, or incur any
liability to, any Person under, or in connection with the transactions
contemplated by, the Financing or Buyers other financing efforts. Buyer will
reimburse the Company and the Stockholders for all expenses incurred by them
in connection with the Buyers Financing or Buyers other financing efforts or
replacement therefor (including any equity financing). 

(f) Buyer acknowledges and agrees that the obtaining of the Financing is not a
condition to the Closing.

defined in the Commitment Letter) that reduces the amount of the commitments
under the Facilities set forth in the Commitment Letter shall be held by Buyer
and used solely to effect the Closing.

without any liability for the Company or any Company Subsidiary thereof
following the Closing.

being understood that Buyer shall not be required to pay the Termination Fee
on more than one occasion). Solely for purposes of establishing the basis for
the amount thereof, the Parties agree that the Termination Fee is a
liquidated damage and not a penalty and the payment of the Termination Fee in
the circumstances specified herein is supported by due and sufficient
consideration.

(b) In the event that this Agreement is terminated or deemed terminated
pursuant to Section 9.1(e), the Companys receipt of the Termination Fee shall

Company or the Equity Holders commence litigation that results in a judgment
against Buyer for the Termination Fee or any portion thereof, Buyer shall
reimburse the Company and the Equity Holders for all of their out-of-pocket
costs and expenses (including attorneys fees) in connection with such suit,
together with interest on such amount or portion thereof at the prime rate in
effect on the date such payment was required to be made (as reported in the

non-discrimination requirements (including ADP and ACP testing) of Section
401(a), 401(k) or 401(m) of the Code due to failure to properly consider
all the entities that are part of the applicable "controlled group" (as
defined in the Code), with respect to any plan year ending on or before the
Closing Date (the " _Plan Failure_ "); Losses for the Plan Failure shall
include reasonable costs and expenses, including professional fees and
contributions

 



-59-   of funds to the plan(s) incurred in rectifying such Plan Failure pursuant to
generally accepted principles, including those set forth in IRS Rev. Proc.
2013-12 (the _Plan Indemnity_ "); the Plan Indemnity shall be the sole remedy
available to the Buyer Indemnified Parties with respect to the Plan Failure;
notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, the Plan Indemnity
shall not be contingent on the occurrence of any claim, audit or
investigation by any Person and shall not require any condition precedent
other than the presence of the Plan Failure.

(b) Subject to the provisions of this _Article X_ , from and after the
Closing, each Stockholder shall, severally and not jointly, indemnify and hold
harmless each of the Buyer Indemnified Parties from, against and in respect
of any and all Losses arising out of:

(i) any breach of any representation or warranty made by such Stockholder in
_Article IV_ ;

(ii) any breach of any covenant, agreement or undertaking made by such
Stockholder in this Agreement that is required to be performed after the
Closing; and

 

(iii) fraud by such Stockholder.

The Losses of the Buyer Indemnified Parties described in this _Section 10.1_
as to which the Buyer Indemnified Parties are entitled to indemnification are
collectively referred to as " _Buyer Losses_." For purposes of determining
whether a breach of any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement
occurred in determining Losses under this _Section 10.1_, no effect shall be
given to any Supplement unless the event or circumstance described in such
Supplement was an action of the Company or the Stockholders that was (i)
permitted without consent under the terms of this Agreement or (ii) otherwise
consented to in writing by Buyer. For purposes of calculating Losses under
this _Section 10.1_ (but not for purposes of determining whether a breach of
any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement occurred), all
representations, warranties, covenants and agreements which contain
qualifying language such as material, Material Adverse Effect and like terms
shall be read without the inclusion of such qualifying language.

Section 10.2 _Indemnification Obligations of Buyer_. Buyer shall indemnify and
hold harmless each of the Seller Indemnified Parties from, against and in
respect of any and all Losses arising out of:

(a) any breach of any representation or warranty made by Buyer in _Article V_
; and

 

(b) any breach of any covenant, agreement or undertaking made by Buyer in this
Agreement.

 

The Losses of the Seller Indemnified Parties described in this _Section 10.2_
as to which the Seller Indemnified Parties are entitled to indemnification
are collectively referred to as " _Seller Losses_."

 



-60-  Section 10.3 _Indemnification Procedure_.

 

(a) The Buyer shall have the right to control and defend, with counsel of its
choosing reasonably acceptable to the Sellers Representative, all claims,
actions, suits, proceedings, arbitrations, mediations, audits, investigations
or reviews that relate to Indemnified Misclassification Claims.

(b) Promptly after receipt by an Indemnified Party of notice from a third
party of a threatened or filed complaint or the threatened or actual
commencement of any audit, investigation, action or proceeding other than a
Misclassification Claim (a " _Third Party Claim_ ") with respect to which such
Indemnified Party may be entitled to indemnification hereunder, such
Indemnified Party shall provide prompt written notice to Buyer or the Equity
Holders, whichever is the appropriate indemnifying Party hereunder (the "
_Indemnifying Party_ "); _provided_ , _however_ , that the failure to so
notify the Indemnifying Party shall relieve the Indemnifying Party from
liability under this Agreement with respect to such claim only if, and only to
the extent that, such failure to notify the Indemnifying Party results in (i)
the forfeiture by the Indemnifying Party of material rights and defenses
otherwise available to the Indemnifying Party with respect to such claim or
(ii) material prejudice to the Indemnifying Party with respect to such claim.
The Indemnifying Party shall have the right, upon written notice delivered to
the Indemnified Party within thirty (30) days thereafter, to assume the
defense of such Third Party Claim, including the employment of counsel
reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnified Party (and Buyer hereby
acknowledges that King and Spalding LLP shall be satisfactory to the
Indemnified Party if Buyer is the Indemnified Party) and the payment of the
fees and disbursements of such counsel. If the Indemnifying Party declines or
fails to assume the defense of such Third Party Claim within such thirty (30)
day period, however, the Indemnified Party may employ counsel to represent or
defend it in any such Third Party Claim and, if the Indemnifying Party agrees
that such Third Party Claim is a matter with respect to which the Indemnified
Party is entitled to receive payment from the Indemnifying Party for the Loss
in question, the Indemnifying Party will pay the reasonable fees and
disbursements of such counsel as incurred; _provided_ , _however_ , that the
Indemnifying Party will not be required to pay the fees and disbursements of
more than one counsel for all Indemnified Parties in any jurisdiction in any
single Third Party Claim. In any Third Party Claim or Misclassification Claim
with respect to which indemnification is being sought hereunder, the
Indemnified Party or the Indemnifying Party, whichever is not assuming the
defense of such action, shall have the right to participate in such matter and
to retain its own counsel at such Partys own expense. The Indemnifying Party
or the Indemnified Party, as the case may be, shall at all times use
reasonable efforts to keep the Indemnifying Party or the Indemnified Party, as
the case may be, reasonably apprised of the status of any matter the defense
of which they are maintaining and to cooperate in good faith with each other
with respect to the defense of any such matter.

(c) Subject to the provisions contained in _Schedule 10.1(a)(iv)_ , no
Indemnified Party may settle or compromise any claim or consent to the entry
of any judgment with respect to which indemnification is being sought
hereunder, including, but not limited to, with respect to Indemnified
Misclassification Claims, without the prior written consent of the
Indemnifying Party which shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or
delayed (it being acknowledged that any settlement which is generally
consistent with amounts of prior settlements of Misclassification Claims by
the Company or any Company Subsidiary shall be deemed reasonable).

(d) If an Indemnified Party claims a right to payment pursuant to this
Agreement not involving a Third Party Claim or a Misclassification Claim, such
Indemnified Party shall send written notice of such claim to the appropriate
Indemnifying Party. Such notice shall specify in reasonable detail the basis
for such claim. As promptly as possible after the Indemnified Party has given
such notice, such Indemnified Party and the appropriate Indemnifying Party
shall establish the merits and amount of such claim (by mutual agreement,
litigation or otherwise) and, within five (5) Business Days of the final
determination of the merits and amount of such claim, (i) if the Indemnifying
Party is an Equity Holder(s), such Equity Holder(s) shall, subject to
_Sections 10.5_ and _10.6_ or, as applicable, the Sellers Representative (on
behalf of the Equity Holders) shall cause the Escrow Agent to, pay to Buyer in
immediately available funds an amount equal to such claim as determined
hereunder, and (ii) if the Indemnifying Party is the Buyer, the Buyer shall
pay to (A) the Sellers Representative (on behalf of the Stockholders and the
Warrant Holder) an amount equal to such Stockholders and Warrant Holders
Pro Rata Percentage of such claim as determined hereunder in immediately
available funds and (B) the Company (on behalf of the Option Holders) an
amount equal to such Option Holders Pro Rata Percentage of such claim as
determined hereunder in immediately available funds, which the Company shall
promptly distribute to the Option Holders in accordance with their respective
Pro Rata Percentages and subject to  _Section 2.8(h)_.

 



-61-  Section 10.4 _Claims Period_. The Claims Period hereunder shall begin on
the Closing Date and terminate as follows:

(a) with respect to Buyer Losses arising under (i) _Section
10.1(a)(i)_ with respect to any breach or inaccuracy of _Section 3.1_
(Organization), _Section 3.2_ (Authorization), _Section 3.3_
(Capitalization), _Section 3.4_ (Company Subsidiaries), _Section 3.13_

Claims Period shall terminate on the date that is thirty-six (36) months
following the Closing Date;

(b) with respect to Buyer Losses arising under  _Section 10.1(a)(i)_,

or Stockholder Fundamental Representations, the Claims Period shall terminate
on the date that is twelve (12) months following the Closing Date;

(c) with respect to Buyer Losses or Seller Losses under _Section
10.1(a)(ii)_, _10.1(b)(ii)_ or _10.2(b)_ , the Claims Period shall terminate

that with respect to covenants and agreements contained herein requiring
performance after the Closing Date, the Claims Period for such covenants and
agreements shall be twelve (12) months following the stated end performance

-62-  (d) with respect to Buyer Losses arising under _Section 10.1(a)(iv)(1)_,
the Claims Period shall terminate upon the final resolution of all Known
Misclassification Claims;

(e) with respect to Seller Losses arising under _Section 10.2(a)_, the
Claims Period shall terminate on the date that is twelve (12) months following
the Closing Date; and

(f) with respect to other Buyer Losses, the Claims Period shall be the
applicable period of statutes of limitations.

No claim for indemnification can be made after the expiration of the relevant
Claims Period; _provided_ , _however_ , if prior to the close of business on
the last day of the Claims Period, an Indemnifying Party shall have been
properly notified of a claim for indemnity hereunder and such claim shall not
have been finally resolved or disposed of at such date, such claim shall
continue to survive and shall remain a basis for indemnity hereunder until
such claim is finally resolved or disposed of in accordance with the terms
hereof.

Section 10.5  _Liability Limits_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
set forth in this Agreement, the Equity Holders obligation to indemnify,
defend and hold the Buyer Indemnified Parties harmless shall be limited as
follows:

 

(a) no amounts of indemnity shall be payable pursuant to _Section 10.1_
unless and until the Buyer Indemnified Parties shall have suffered Buyer
Losses in excess of $2,000,000 (the " _Threshold Amount_ ") in the aggregate,
in which case the Buyer Indemnified Parties shall be entitled to recover only
Buyer Losses in excess of the Threshold Amount;  _provided_ , that amounts of
indemnity for Buyer Losses pursuant to (i) _Section 10.1(a)(i)_ with respect
the Company Fundamental Representations, (ii) _Section 10.1(b)(i)_ with
respect to the Stockholder Fundamental Representations, or (iii) _Section
10.1(a)(ii)_, _Section 10.1(a)(iii)_, _Section 10.1(a)(iv)_, _Section
10.1(a)(v)_, _Section 10.1(a)(vi)_, _Section 10.1(a)(vii)_,  _Section
10.1(b)(ii)_ or _Section 10.1(b)(iii)_ in each case, shall not be subject to
the Threshold Amount;

 

(b) subject to the provisos contained in this _Section 10.5(b)_, any
indemnification obligation of the Equity Holders pursuant to this _Article X_
shall be satisfied solely from (x) the Holdback Amount, with respect to
_Section 10.1(a)(iv)_, and (y) the Escrow Amount with respect to all other
Buyer Losses; _provided_ , _however_ , that, subject to _Section 10.4_,
Buyer may seek indemnification for Buyer Losses (i) arising under _Section
10.1(b)(i)_ (with respect to Stockholder Fundamental Representations),
_Section 10.2(b)(ii)_ or  _Section 10.2(b)(iii)_ directly from the relevant
Stockholder, and (ii) with respect to Company Fundamental Representations or
arising under _Section 10.1(a)(ii)_, or _10.1(a)(iii)_ , from each Equity
Holder, directly based on such Equity Holders Pro Rata percentage but not to
exceed the amount such Equity Holder received as a result of the transaction
(the " _Proceeds Cap_ ");

 

(c) in no event shall the aggregate amount of the indemnification obligations
of the Equity Holders related to Indemnified Misclassification Claims exceed
the Holdback Amount;

(d) except for Buyer Losses with respect to  _Section 10.1(a)(v)_ or
_10.2(b)(iii)_ , in no event shall the aggregate amount of indemnity required
to be paid by each Equity Holder pursuant to _Section 10.1_ exceed the
Proceeds Cap;

 



-63-  (e) the liability of each Equity Holder with respect to Buyer Losses arising
under  _Section 10.1(a)_ shall be several and not joint based on such Equity
Holders relative Pro Rata Percentage;

 

(f) no Equity Holder shall have any liability for Buyer Losses arising under
_Section 10.1(b)_ except to the extent such Equity Holder has made the
representation or warranty in _Article IV_ or made the covenant, agreement or
undertaking in this Agreement under which such Buyer Losses arise or committed
fraud;

 

(g) each Equity Holder shall be deemed to have a subaccount of the Escrow Fund
in an amount equal to such Equity Holders Pro Rata Percentage of the Escrow
Amount (each, a " _Subaccount_ ");

(h) notwithstanding anything set forth herein to the contrary, but subject to
_Section 10.5(b)_, (i) any indemnification obligation of an Equity Holder
under this Agreement shall be satisfied solely from such Equity Holders
Subaccount of the Escrow Fund; (ii) in the event that, following satisfaction
of an indemnification claim for Buyer Losses from a Subaccount of the Escrow
Fund, a subsequent claim for indemnification is made pursuant to this _Article
X_ , Buyer Losses shall be payable only from the Escrow Fund out of each
Equity Holders Subaccount based on that Equity Holders Pro Rata Percentage
of such Buyer Losses and; (iii) if any Equity Holders Subaccount is
insufficient to satisfy such Equity Holders Pro Rata Percentage of Buyer
Losses, then such Buyer Losses will remain unsatisfied notwithstanding that
other Subaccounts have sufficient funds to satisfy such Buyer Losses and no
Buyer Indemnified Party shall be entitled to recover any such shortfalls from
the Subaccounts of other Equity Holders;

(i) for purposes of computing the aggregate amount of indemnifiable claims
against the Equity Holders, the amount of each claim for Buyer Losses by a
Buyer Indemnified Party shall be deemed to be an amount equal to, and any
payments by the Equity Holders pursuant to _Section 10.1_ shall be limited
to, the amount of such Buyer Losses that remain after deducting therefrom any
third party insurance proceeds and any indemnity, contributions or other
similar payment actually recovered from any third party with respect thereto;

 

(j) the amount of indemnity payable pursuant to _Section 10.1_ with respect
to any Buyer Loss shall be reduced to the extent such Buyer Loss is reflected
on the Final Closing Statement;

(k) in any claim for indemnification under this Agreement, the Equity Holders
shall not be required to indemnify any Person for punitive, incidental,
consequential, special or indirect losses, business interruption loss, loss of
future revenue, diminution in value, lost profits or income, or loss of
business reputation or other opportunity or damages based on a multiplier of
earning or other financial measure (other than any such punitive or other
damages awarded as a result of a third party claim);

 

(l) any Indemnified Party that becomes aware of a Loss for which it seeks
indemnification under this _Article X_ shall be required to use commercially
reasonable efforts (i) to mitigate such Loss, and (ii) to obtain insurance
proceeds or proceeds from other sources of indemnification available to such
Party (in each case consistent with sound and standard business practices of
such Party); _provided_ , _however_ , nothing shall be deemed to require
initiation of any proceedings;

 



-64-  (m) no Party shall have any liability for any Loss which would not have arisen
but for any alteration or repeal or enactment of any Law after the Closing
Date;

(n) the Equity Holders shall have no liability for any Buyer Loss that would
not have arisen but for any change in the accounting policies, practices or
procedures adopted by Buyer and/or its Affiliates or for any other act or
omission by Buyer and/or its Affiliates after the Closing Date;

 

(o) in any case where a Buyer Indemnified Party recovers from any third party
any amount in respect of a matter with respect to which the Equity Holders
have indemnified Buyer pursuant to this Agreement, such Buyer Indemnified
Party shall promptly pay over to the Sellers Representative (on behalf of the
Stockholders and the Warrant Holder) and to the Company (on behalf of
the Option Holders, and which the Company shall promptly distribute to the
Option Holders in accordance with their respective Pro Rata Percentages and
subject to _Section 2.8(h))_ such Equity Holders Pro Rata Percentage of the
amount so recovered;

(p) the liability of the Equity Holders for Buyer Losses shall be considered
in the aggregate and shall be determined on a cumulative basis so the Buyer
Losses incurred under _Article X_ shall be combined with all other Buyer
Losses incurred under _Article X_ for purposes of determining limitations on
liability, including the maximum liability amounts described above;

(q) any indemnity payment under this Agreement shall be treated as an
adjustment to the Purchase Price for U.S. federal income tax purposes; and

(r) notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, no
past, present or future director, officer, employee, incorporator, affiliate,
management, vendor, service provider, agent, attorney or representative of the
Company, any Company Subsidiary, the Equity Holders or any of Sellers
Affiliates shall have any liability for (i) any obligations or liabilities of
the Company, any Company Subsidiary, the Equity Holders or any of Sellers
Affiliates relating to or arising from this Agreement or (ii) any claim
against the Company, any Company Subsidiary, the Equity Holders or any of
Sellers Affiliates based on, in respect of, or by reason of, the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement.

Section 10.6 _Holdback Amount_ The Parties acknowledge and agree that the
Holdback Amount will not be funded by Buyer at the Closing. Buyer agrees to
deliver the Holdback Amount (or the remaining portion thereof) to the
Sellers Representative for distribution to the Equity Holders pursuant to the
terms of this Agreement and as set forth on _Schedule 10.1(a)(iv)_. The Buyer
shall not take any action outside the normal course of its business, or fail
to take any action in the normal course, for the principal purpose of
frustrating the ability of the Equity Holders to be eligible to recover and to
recover the Holdback Amount. Except as set forth in this Agreement, the Buyer
shall have no right to set-off any other amount to which it is or is
potentially owed by the Equity Holders from the Holdback Amount.

 



-65-  Section 10.7 _Exclusive Remedies_. From and after the Closing, the provisions
of this _Article X_ hereof set forth the exclusive rights and remedies of the
Parties to seek or obtain damages or any other remedy or relief whatsoever
from any party with respect to matters arising under or in connection with
this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby. Without in any way
limiting the provisions of _Section 10.5_ hereof, the Parties agree that,
excluding any claim for injunctive or other equitable relief or claims for
fraud against any Person, the indemnification provisions of this _Article X_
are intended to provide the sole and exclusive remedy as to all claims against
either the Company and the Equity Holders (it being acknowledged and agreed
that, subject to the provisions of  _Section 10.5(b)_ and _10.5(c)_ , the
Equity Holders shall have no liability under this Agreement apart from their
beneficial interests in the Escrow Fund and the Holdback Amount), on the one
hand, and the Buyer, on the other hand, may incur arising from or relating to
this Agreement and the agreements and documents contemplated hereby and the
transactions contemplated hereby and thereby. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
this _Section 10.7_ shall not operate to interfere with or impede the
operation of the provisions of _Article II_ providing for the (i) resolution
of certain disputes relating to the Purchase Price between the parties and/or
by the Accounting Firm (and the limits and procedures in  _Article X_ shall
be inapplicable with respect thereto), (ii) limit the rights of the Parties to
seek equitable remedies (including specific performance or injunctive relief),
or (iii) limit remedies prior to the Closing.

in such court, (c) such Partys property is exempt or immune from
execution, (d) such action, suit or proceeding is brought in an inconvenient

Exhibits attached hereto), the Confidentiality Agreement, the Escrow Agreement
and the other documents delivered pursuant to this Agreement constitute the
entire agreement among the Parties with respect to the subject matter of this
Agreement and supersede all other prior agreements and understandings, both

Agreement, such Party has not relied on any promises or assurances, written or
oral, that are not reflected in this Agreement (including the Schedules and
Exhibits attached hereto), the Confidentiality Agreement, the Escrow Agreement
and the other documents delivered pursuant to this Agreement.

Section 11.9 _Governing Law_. This Agreement shall be governed by and
construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Delaware (regardless of
the laws that might otherwise govern under applicable principles of conflicts

construction, effect, performance and remedies.

Section 11.10 _Specific Performance_. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the
Parties acknowledge that the rights of each Party to consummate the
transactions contemplated hereby are unique and recognize and affirm that in
the event of a breach of this Agreement by any Party, money damages may be
inadequate and the non-breaching Party may have no adequate remedy at law.
Accordingly, except in the event of a termination by the
Sellers Representative pursuant to _Section 9.1(e)_ for which the sole
remedy shall be the Termination Fee, the Parties agree that such non-breaching
Party shall have the right, in addition to any other rights and remedies
existing in their favor at law or in equity, to enforce their rights and the
other Partys obligations hereunder not only by an action or actions for
damages but also by an action or actions for specific performance, injunctive
and/or other equitable relief (without posting of bond or other security).
Except in the event of a termination by the Sellers Representative pursuant
to _Section 9.1(e)_ for which the sole remedy shall be the Termination Fee,
Buyer acknowledges that prior to the Closing, the Company and the
Stockholders will have the right to specifically enforce the obligations of
Buyer to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby on the terms and
pursuant to the conditions of this Agreement.

days from the Closing.

 

(d) The Sellers Representative, or the Company, if requested by the Sellers
Representative, shall report and withhold any Taxes (from amounts paid by or

communication shall be given or received by such Equity Holders individually),
(iv) authorize the release or delivery to Buyer of all or a portion of the
Escrow Amount or Holdback Amount in satisfaction of indemnification claims by
Buyer or any other Buyer Indemnified Party pursuant to _Article X_ (including

enter into settlements and compromises of, demand arbitration or litigation
of, and comply with orders of arbitrators or courts with respect to, (A)

Representative shall not be liable to any Equity Holder in the absence of
gross negligence or willful misconduct on the part of the Sellers
Representative. Each Equity Holder shall severally (based on each such Equity
Holders Pro Rata Percentage), and not jointly, indemnify and hold harmless
the Sellers Representative from and against any Loss incurred without gross
negligence or willful misconduct on the part of the Sellers Representative
and arising out of or in connection with the acceptance or administration of
its duties hereunder. If not paid directly to the Sellers Representative by
the Equity Holders, such Losses may be recovered by the Sellers
Representative from the Escrow Amount or Holdback Amount otherwise
distributable to the Equity Holders (and not distributed or distributable to
any Buyer Indemnified Party or subject to a pending indemnification claim of
any Buyer Indemnified Party) following the expiration of all Claims Periods
and final resolution of all claims made prior to the expiration thereof
pursuant to the terms hereof and of the Escrow Agreement, at the time of
distribution, and such recovery will be made from the Equity Holders

-72-  Section 11.16 _Schedules_. Disclosure of any fact or item in any Schedule
hereto referenced by a particular Section in this Agreement shall be deemed
to have been disclosed with respect to every other Section in this Agreement
in respect of which such disclosure is reasonably apparent. The specification
of any dollar amount in the representations or warranties contained in this
Agreement or the inclusion of any specific item in any Schedules hereto is not
intended to imply that such amounts, or higher or lower amounts or the items
so included or other items, are or are not material, and no Party shall use
the fact of the setting of such amounts or the inclusion of any such item in
any dispute or controversy as to whether any obligation, items or matter not
described herein or included in a Schedule is or is not material for purposes
of this Agreement.

Section 11.17 _Conflict Waiver_. King and Spalding LLP has represented the
Company and the Equity Holders. All Parties recognize the commonality of
interest that exists and will continue to exist until Closing, and the Parties
agree that such commonality of interest should continue to be recognized
after the Closing. Specifically, Buyer agrees that (a) it shall not, and
shall not cause the Company or any Affiliate of the Company to, seek to have
King and Spalding LLP disqualified from representing any Equity Holder or such
Equity Holders Affiliates in connection with any dispute that may arise
between such parties and Buyer or the Company in connection with this
Agreement or the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and (b) in
connection with any such dispute, the Equity Holders or the Equity Holders
Affiliates involved in such dispute (and not Buyer or the Company) will have
the right to decide whether or not to waive the attorney-client privilege that
may apply to any communications between the Company and King and Spalding LLP
that occurred prior to the Closing.

Section 11.18 _Waiver of Claims Against Financing Parties_. None of the
Financing Sources will have any liability to the Company, the Equity Holders
or its and their Affiliates relating to or arising out of this Agreement, the
Financing or otherwise, whether at law, or equity, in contract, in tort or
otherwise, and neither the Company, the Equity Holders, nor any of its and
their Affiliates will have any rights or claims against any of the Financing
Parties hereunder or thereunder.

_ESCROW AGREEMENT_

THIS ESCROW AGREEMENT (this " _Agreement_ "), is made and entered into as of
this [ ] day of [ ], 2013, by and among XPO Logistics,
Inc. (" _Buyer_ "), Logistics Holding Company Limited (the " _Sellers 
Representative_"), and SUNTRUST BANK, a Georgia banking corporation, as escrow
agent (the " _Escrow Agent_ "). Buyer, the Sellers Representative and the
Escrow Agent are each referred to herein as a " _Party_ " and collectively as
the " _Parties_."

_BACKGROUND_

A. Buyer, 3PD Holding, Inc. (the " _Company_ "), the stockholders of the
Company and the Sellers Representative have entered into a Stock Purchase
Agreement (the " _Purchase Agreement_ "), dated as of July 12, 2013, pursuant
to which, subject to the terms and conditions of the Purchase Agreement, the
stockholders of the Company will sell to Buyer, and Buyer will purchase from
the stockholders, warrant holder and option holders of the Company (the "
_Equity Holders_ "), all of the issued and outstanding shares of capital
stock of the Company for the consideration set forth in the Purchase
Agreement.

 

B. Buyer and the Equity Holders have agreed to establish an escrow fund
pursuant to the Purchase Agreement, providing for the delivery on the Closing
Date to the Escrow Agent of the sum of Ten Million Dollars ($10,000,000) (the
" _Escrow Amount_ ").

 

C. Pursuant to the Purchase Agreement, the Sellers Representative is
authorized to act on behalf of the Equity Holders with respect to this
Agreement.

D. The Escrow Agent is willing to act as escrow agent under this Agreement.

 

 _AGREEMENT_

In consideration of the premises and the mutual promises and agreements
contained herein, the Parties, intending to be legally bound, hereby agree as
follows:

 

1\. _Definitions_. Capitalized terms used but not otherwise defined in this
Agreement shall have the meanings ascribed to such terms in the Purchase
Agreement.

2\. _The Escrow Agent Appointment_. Buyer and the Sellers Representative
hereby appoint and designate SunTrust Bank as the Escrow Agent, to receive,
hold, and distribute the Escrow Fund (as hereinafter defined) in accordance
with the terms of this Agreement. The Escrow Agent hereby accepts its
appointment as the Escrow Agent and agrees to hold, administer, invest, and
disburse the Escrow Fund in accordance with the terms hereof.

3\. _Escrow Fund_. 

3.1 _Escrow Fund_. Upon the execution of this Agreement, Buyer has delivered
to the Escrow Agent, by wire transfer of immediately available funds to an
account designated by the Escrow Agent (the " _Escrow Account_ "), the Escrow
Amount (as adjusted from time to time pursuant to the terms hereof, the "
_Escrow Fund_ "). Unless otherwise instructed in joint  written instructions signed by Buyer and the Sellers Representative, the
Escrow Agent shall invest all funds held pursuant to this Agreement in
accordance with the Investment Selection Instructions set forth on _Exhibit
A_ hereto, with the income from such invested cash being held by the Escrow
Agent as part of the Escrow Fund. The Escrow Agent shall have no liability for
any loss resulting from investments made in accordance with this Agreement.
The Escrow Agent shall send statements to the Sellers Representative and
Buyer on a monthly basis reflecting activity in the Escrow Fund for the
preceding month. No statement need be rendered for the Escrow Fund if
no activity occurred for such month. On or before the execution and delivery
of this Agreement, each of the Parties (other than the Escrow Agent) shall
provide to the Escrow Agent a completed Form W-9 or Form W-8, whichever is
appropriate.

 

3.2 _Disbursement of the Escrow Fund_. The Escrow Fund shall secure the
obligations with respect to amounts due and payable on or prior to the Escrow
Termination Date (as defined below) to Buyer under Section 2.8 of the Purchase
Agreement or any Buyer Indemnified Parties under Article X of the Purchase
Agreement. This Agreement shall not change or modify in any way the events or
circumstances which give rise to the obligation to make any payments pursuant
to the Purchase Agreement, but shall solely provide Buyer security therefor.
The Escrow Agent shall disburse the amounts from time-to-time on deposit in
the Escrow Fund as follows:

(a) The Escrow Fund shall be disbursed by the Escrow Agent, in the manner set
forth in  _Section 3.2(e)_ hereof, only in accordance with (i) a written
instrument delivered to the Escrow Agent that is executed by both Buyer and
the Sellers Representative (" _Joint Written Instruction_ "), that
instructs the Escrow Agent as to the disbursement of some or all of the
Escrow Fund or (ii) a final, non-appealable order of a court of competent
jurisdiction (an " _Order_ "), a copy of which is delivered to the Escrow
Agent by either Buyer or the Sellers Representative, that instructs the
Escrow Agent as to the disbursement of some or all of the Escrow Fund.

(b) Buyer and the Sellers Representative shall deliver a Joint Written
Instruction to disburse the Escrow Fund (after the payments, if any, have been
made pursuant to _Section 3.2(c)_ below) as follows: one hundred percent
(100%) of the remaining balance of the Escrow Fund, including any investment
income thereon, shall, on the date that is one (1) year from the Closing Date
(the " _One-Year Anniversary_ "), be distributed to the Sellers
Representative and/or the Company in the manner, and allocated as set forth
in, such Joint Written Instruction, unless on the One-Year Anniversary there
exists an unresolved bona fide claim for a Payment (as defined below)
hereunder for which notice has been given under the Purchase Agreement, in
which event the Escrow Agent shall retain so much of the Escrow Fund as is
mutually agreed by Buyer and the Sellers Representative to be sufficient to
satisfy any such unresolved claim, as well as attorney fees and costs
associated therewith. Any Escrow Fund, including any investment income
thereon, remaining on deposit after such claims shall have been satisfied,
shall be returned to the Sellers Representative and/or the Company promptly
after the time of satisfaction. " _Payment_ " shall mean any amount payable to
Buyer under Section 2.8 of the Purchase Agreement and the amount of any
Buyer Losses for which a Buyer Indemnified Party is entitled to
indemnification under Article X of the Purchase Agreement.

 



\- 2 -  (c) Buyer and the Sellers Representative agree that the Escrow Fund shall be
paid in connection with a claim for a Payment pursuant to the terms and
conditions set forth in the Purchase Agreement and agree to provide Joint
Written Instructions to the Escrow Agent in order to effect the transactions
contemplated by the Purchase Agreement. The Escrow Agent shall have no duty
or obligation to determine whether claims are properly asserted under the
terms of the Purchase Agreement or whether Joint Written Instructions
pertaining to the disbursement of the Escrow furnished to the Escrow Agent
conform to the terms of the Purchase Agreement.

(d) _Termination of Escrow Fund_. The Escrow Account and this Agreement
(except as otherwise set forth herein) shall terminate upon the first to occur
of (the " _Escrow Termination Date_ ") (i) the joint written agreement of
Buyer and the Sellers Representative and (ii) the disbursement of all
amounts in the Escrow Account pursuant to this _Section 3.2_.

(e) _Method of Distribution_. All funds distributed from the Escrow Account to
Buyer, the Sellers Representative or the Company, shall be transferred by
wire transfer of immediately available funds to such accounts as Buyer or the
Sellers Representative, as the case may be, shall notify the Escrow Agent in
writing.

Notwithstanding any other provision of this Escrow Agreement, the Escrow Agent
shall deliver all or any part of the Escrow Fund in accordance with the terms
of any Joint Direction except to the extent an order of a court of competent
jurisdiction by which the Escrow Agent is bound prohibits the Escrow Agent
from complying with the terms hereof.

4\. _Escrow Agent_.

4.1 _Duties_. In performing its duties under this Agreement or upon the
claimed failure to perform its duties hereunder, the Escrow Agent shall have
no liability except for the Escrow Agents bad faith, willful misconduct or
gross negligence. The Escrow Agents sole responsibility shall be for the
safekeeping and disbursement of the Escrow Fund in accordance with the terms
of this Agreement. The Escrow Agent shall have no implied duties or
obligations and shall not be charged with knowledge or notice of any fact or
circumstance not specifically set forth herein. The Escrow Agent shall be
entitled to rely upon and shall be protected in acting upon any request,
instruction, statement or other instrument, not only as to its due execution,
validity and effectiveness, but also as to the truth and accuracy of any
information contained therein, which the Escrow Agent shall in good faith
believe to be genuine, to have been signed or presented by the person or
parties purporting to sign the same and to conform to the provisions of this
Agreement. In no event shall the Escrow Agent be liable for incidental,
indirect, special, consequential or punitive damages. The Escrow Agent shall
not be obligated to take any legal action or to commence any proceeding in
connection with the Escrow Fund, any account in which the Escrow Fund is
deposited, or this Agreement, or to appear in, prosecute or defend any

 



\- 3 -   such legal action or proceedings. The Escrow Agent may consult legal counsel
selected by it in the event of any dispute or question as to the construction
of any of the provisions hereof or of any other agreement or of its duties
hereunder, and shall incur no liability and shall be fully protected from any
liability whatsoever in acting in good faith in accordance with the advice,
opinion or instruction of such counsel. The Escrow Agent shall not be
required to take notice of the Purchase Agreement or have any obligations or
responsibilities in connection with the Purchase Agreement, the transactions
contemplated thereby or any other agreement between any other parties to
the Purchase Agreement, other than this Agreement. The Escrow Agent shall
have no liability with respect to the transfer or distribution of any funds
affected by the Escrow Agent pursuant to wiring or transfer instructions
provided to the Escrow Agent in accordance with the provisions of this
Agreement. The Escrow Agent shall have no liability with respect to the
transfer or distribution of any funds effected by the Escrow Agent pursuant to
a Joint Direction provided to the Escrow Agent in accordance with the
provisions of this Agreement.

4.2 _Indemnification_.

 

(a) From and at all times after the date of this Agreement, Buyer and the
Sellers Representative (on behalf of the Equity Holders) shall, subject to
the last sentence of _Section 4.2(b)_ hereof, jointly and severally (with
each of Buyer, on the one hand, and the Sellers Representative (on behalf of
the Equity Holders), on the other hand, being responsible for such expenses
consistent with _Section 4.2(b)_), to the fullest extent permitted by law and
to the extent provided herein, indemnify and hold harmless the Escrow Agent
and each director, officer, employee, attorney and agent of the Escrow Agent
(collectively, the " _Indemnified Parties_ ") against any and all actions,
claims, losses, damages, liabilities, costs and expenses of any kind or nature
whatsoever (including, without limitation, reasonable attorneys fees, costs
and expenses but excluding incidental, indirect, special, consequential or
punitive damages) incurred by or asserted against any of the Indemnified
Parties from and after the date hereof directly or indirectly in connection
with this Agreement or the Escrow Agents performance of its duties and
obligations under this Agreement; _provided_ , _however_ , that no Indemnified
Party shall have the right to be indemnified hereunder for any liability (or
any cost or expense related to such liability, including, without limitation,
attorneys fees, costs and expenses) finally determined by a court of
competent jurisdiction, subject to no further appeal, to the extent such
liability results from the bad faith, gross negligence or willful misconduct
of such Indemnified Party. If any such action or claim shall be brought or
asserted against any Indemnified Party, such Indemnified Party shall promptly
notify Buyer and the Sellers Representative in writing, and Buyer and the
Sellers Representative shall have the right to assume the defense thereof,
including the employment of counsel and the payment of all expenses (which
expenses shall be subject to  _Section 4.2(b)_). Such Indemnified Party
shall, in its sole discretion, have the right to employ separate counsel in
any such action and to participate in the defense thereof, and the fees and
expenses of such counsel shall be paid by such Indemnified Party unless (i)
Buyer and the Sellers Representative agree in writing to pay such fees and
expenses, (ii) Buyer and the Sellers Representative shall fail to assume the
defense of such action or proceeding or (iii) the named parties to any such
action or proceeding (including

 



\- 4 -   any impleaded parties) include both the Indemnified Party, on the one hand,
and Buyer or the Sellers Representative or any Equity Holder, on the other
hand, and the Indemnified Party shall have been advised in writing by outside
counsel that there are one or more legal defenses available to it which are
materially different from or additional to those available to Buyer or the
Sellers Representative or any such Equity Holder. All such fees and expenses
payable by Buyer or the Sellers Representative pursuant to the foregoing
sentence shall be paid from time to time as incurred, both in advance of and
after the final disposition of such action or claim. All of the foregoing
losses, damages, costs and expenses of the Indemnified Parties shall be
payable upon demand of such Indemnified Party, in accordance with _Sections
4.2(b)_ and _4.6_ hereof (with each of Buyer, on the one hand, and
the Sellers Representative (on behalf of the Equity Holders), on the other
hand, being responsible for such expenses consistent with _Section 4.2(b)_).
The obligations of Buyer and the Sellers Representative under this  _Section
4.2_ shall survive any termination of this Agreement and the resignation or
removal of the Escrow Agent.

(b) The Parties agree that neither the payment by Buyer or the Sellers
Representative of any claim by an Indemnified Party for indemnification
hereunder nor the disbursement of any amounts to an Indemnified Party from
the Escrow Fund in respect of a claim for indemnification shall impair, limit,
modify, or affect, as between Buyer and the Sellers Representative, the
respective rights and obligations of the Sellers Representative, on the one
hand, and Buyer, on the other hand, under this Agreement. The obligations of
the Sellers Representative and Buyer for indemnification under _Section
4.2(a)_ shall be joint and several as to the Indemnified Parties, but the
Sellers Representative (on behalf of the Equity Holders) and Buyer agree
solely among themselves that any obligation for indemnification under this
_Section 4.2_ shall be borne by the Party or Parties determined by a court
of competent jurisdiction to be responsible for causing the loss, damage,
liability, cost or expense against which an Indemnified Party is entitled to
indemnification or, if no such determination is made, then one-half by Buyer
and one-half by the Sellers Representative (on behalf of the Equity
Holders).

4.3 _Disputes_. If, at any time, the Escrow Agent is unable to determine, to
the Escrow Agents sole satisfaction, the proper disposition of any portion of
the Escrow Fund or the Escrow Agents proper actions with respect to its
obligations hereunder, or if Buyer and the Sellers Representative have not,
within thirty (30) days after the furnishing by the Escrow Agent of a notice
of resignation pursuant to _Section 4.4_ below, appointed a successor escrow
agent to act hereunder, then the Escrow Agent may, in its sole discretion,
take either or both of the following actions:

(a) suspend the performance of any of its obligations under this Agreement
until such uncertainty shall be resolved to the sole satisfaction of the
Escrow Agent or until a successor escrow agent shall have been appointed (as
the case may be); or

 

(b) petition (by means of an interpleader action or any other appropriate
method) any court of competent jurisdiction, for instructions with respect to
such uncertainty, and pay into or deposit with such court all amounts held by
it in the Escrow Fund for holding and disposition in accordance with the
instructions of such court and the Escrow Agent shall thereupon be discharged
from all further obligations as Escrow Agent under this Agreement.

 



\- 5 -  The Escrow Agent shall have no liability to Buyer, the Sellers
Representative, any Equity Holder or any other person with respect to any
such suspension of performance or disbursement into court, specifically
including any liability that may arise, or be alleged to have arisen, out of
or as a result of any delay in the disbursement of funds held in the Escrow
Fund or any delay in or with respect to any other action required or requested
of the Escrow Agent, other than any liability that results from the bad faith,
gross negligence or willful misconduct of the Escrow Agent.

4.4 _Resignation of Escrow Agent_. The Escrow Agent may resign from the
performance of its duties hereunder at any time by giving no less than thirty
(30) days prior written notice to Buyer and the Sellers Representative or
may be removed, with or without cause, by Buyer and the Sellers
Representative, acting jointly, at any time by giving no less than ten (10)
days prior written notice to the Escrow Agent. Such resignation or removal
shall take effect upon the appointment of a successor escrow agent or the
deposit of the Escrow Fund into the registry of a court of competent
jurisdiction as provided herein. Upon any such notice of resignation or
removal, Buyer and the Sellers Representative, acting jointly, shall appoint
a successor escrow agent hereunder, which shall be a commercial bank, trust
company or other financial institution with a combined capital and surplus in
excess of $1 billion, unless otherwise agreed by Buyer and the Sellers
Representative. In the event Buyer and the Sellers Representative shall fail
to appoint a successor escrow agent within thirty (30) days after the
resignation or removal of the Escrow Agent, as contemplated hereby, the Escrow
Agent may deposit the Escrow Fund into the registry of a court of competent
jurisdiction and shall thereupon be discharged from all further duties as
Escrow Agent under this Agreement. Upon the acceptance in writing of any
appointment as Escrow Agent hereunder by a successor escrow agent, such
successor escrow agent shall thereupon succeed to and become vested with all
the rights, powers, privileges and duties of the retiring Escrow Agent, and
the retiring Escrow Agent shall be discharged from its duties and obligations
under this Agreement, but shall not be discharged from any liability
for actions taken as Escrow Agent hereunder prior to such succession. After
any retiring Escrow Agents resignation or removal, the provisions of this
Agreement shall inure to its benefit as to any actions taken or omitted to be
taken by it while it was Escrow Agent under this Agreement.

4.5 _Receipt_. By its execution and delivery of this Agreement, the
Escrow Agent acknowledges receipt of the Escrow Amount.

4.6 _Fees_. Buyer and the Sellers Representative shall compensate the Escrow
Agent for its services hereunder in accordance with _Schedule I_ attached
hereto and, in addition, shall reimburse the Escrow Agent for all of its
reasonable out-of-pocket expenses, including attorneys fees,
postage (including express mail and overnight delivery charges) and the like
(other than indemnification obligations of the parties, which shall be subject
to _Section 4.2_

 



\- 6 -   hereof) in accordance with _Schedule I_ attached hereto. All of the
compensation and reimbursement obligations set forth in the previous sentence
shall be payable upon demand by the Escrow Agent and, with respect to the
Escrow Agent, shall be a joint and several obligation of Buyer and the
Sellers Representative (on behalf of the Equity Holders); provided, however,
that solely between Buyer and the Sellers Representative such fees and
expenses shall be paid one-half by Buyer and one-half by the Sellers
Representative (on behalf of the Equity Holders), subject to Section 4.2(b).
The obligations of Buyer and the Sellers Representative under this  _Section
4.6_ shall survive any termination of this Agreement and the resignation or
removal of the Escrow Agent.

Agreement shall be delivered in writing, unless otherwise expressly permitted

5.2 _Time of the Essence; Computation of Time_. Time is of the essence for
each and every provision of this Agreement. For purposes of this Agreement,
the term " _Business Day_ " means any day except Saturday, Sunday or any day
on which banks are generally not open for business in the city of Atlanta,
Georgia. Whenever the last day for the exercise of any privilege or the
discharge of any duty under this Agreement shall fall upon a day that is not a
Business Day, the Party having such privilege or duty may exercise such
privilege or discharge such duty on the next succeeding day which is a
Business Day. 

5.3 _Assignment; Binding Effect_. No party may assign this Agreement or its
rights or obligations hereunder without, if the Sellers Representative
intends to assign, the consent of Buyer and the Escrow Agent, or, if Buyer
intends to assign, the consent of the Sellers Representative and the Escrow
Agent, which consent, in either case, will not be unreasonably withheld or
delayed, _provided_ that the Sellers Representative and Escrow Agent agree
that the Buyer may assign its rights under this Agreement to a direct or
indirect wholly owned subsidiary of Buyer, including a subsidiary formed
solely for the purpose of the transaction contemplated

 



\- 8 -   by the Purchase Agreement, and the Stockholders Representative and Escrow
Agent hereby consent to any such assignment; _provided_ , _further_ , that
such assignment shall not relieve Buyer of any of its obligations hereunder
unless and to the extent satisfied by such assignee. Subject to the foregoing,
this Agreement shall inure to the benefit of and shall be binding upon the
Parties hereto and their respective successors and assigns.

5.4 _Headings_. The headings of the sections of this Agreement are inserted
for reference purposes only and shall not affect the meaning or
interpretation of any provisions of this Agreement.

5.5 _Waiver_. Any Party may, at its option, waive in writing any or all of
the conditions herein contained to which its obligations hereunder are
subject. No waiver of any provision of this Agreement, however, shall
constitute a waiver of any other provision (whether or not similar), nor
shall such waiver constitute a continuing waiver unless otherwise expressly
provided.

5.6  _Construction_. The provisions of this Agreement shall be construed
according to their fair meaning and neither for nor against any Party hereto
irrespective of which Party caused such provisions to be drafted. Each of the
Parties acknowledges that it has been represented by an attorney in
connection with the preparation and execution of this Agreement.

5.7 _No Limitation_. The Parties (other than the Escrow Agent) agree that the
rights and remedies of any Party under this Agreement shall not operate to
limit any other rights and remedies otherwise available to any party under the
Purchase Agreement. 

5.8 _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed in counterparts, each of
which shall be deemed to be an original, but all of which shall constitute
one and the same agreement. Delivery of an executed counterpart of a signature
page to this Agreement by electronic means (including by e-mail or facsimile)
shall be as effective as delivery of a manually executed counterpart of this
Agreement.

5.9 _Severability_. It is the desire and intent of the Parties hereto that the
provisions of this Agreement be enforced to the fullest extent permissible
under the laws and public policies applied in each jurisdiction in which
enforcement is sought. Accordingly, if any particular provision of this
Agreement shall be adjudicated by a court of competent jurisdiction to be
invalid, prohibited or unenforceable for any reason, such provision, as to
such jurisdiction, shall be ineffective, without invalidating the remaining
provisions of this Agreement or affecting the validity or enforceability of
this Agreement or affecting the validity or enforceability of such provision
in any other jurisdiction. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if such provision
could be more narrowly drawn so as not to be invalid, prohibited
or unenforceable in such jurisdiction, it shall, as to such jurisdiction, be
so narrowly drawn, without invalidating the remaining provisions of this
Agreement or affecting the validity or enforceability of such provision in any
other jurisdiction. 

5.10 _Governing Law_. All matters relating to the interpretation,
construction, validity and enforcement of this Agreement shall be governed by
and construed in accordance with the domestic laws of the State of Delaware
without giving effect to any choice or conflict of law provision or rule
(whether of the State of Delaware or any other jurisdiction) that would cause
the application of laws of any jurisdiction other than the State of Delaware.

 



\- 9 -  5.11 _Consent to Jurisdiction and Service of Process_. In connection with any
suit, action or other proceeding arising out of or relating to this
Agreement, the events giving rise to this Agreement or any transaction
contemplated hereby (each, an " _Action_ "), the parties hereto hereby agree
and consent to be subject to the exclusive jurisdiction of the federal courts
located in the State of Delaware, and in the absence of such Federal
jurisdiction, the parties consent to be subject to the exclusive jurisdiction
of the state courts located in the State of Delaware, and hereby waive the
right to assert the lack of personal or subject matter jurisdiction or
improper venue in connection with any such suit, action or other proceeding.
In furtherance of the foregoing, each of the Parties (a) waives the defense
of inconvenient forum, (b) agrees not to commence any Action other than in any
such court and (c) agrees that a final judgment in any such Action shall be
conclusive and may be enforced in other jurisdictions by suit or judgment or
in any other manner provided by law. Each Party further agrees that service of
any process, summons, notice or document by U.S. registered mail to such
Partys address set forth in _Section 5.1_ above shall be effective service
of process for any Action with respect to any matters to which it has
submitted to jurisdiction in this _Section 5.11_ or otherwise.

5.12 _Other Transactions_. The Escrow Agent and any stockholder, director,
officer or employee of the Escrow Agent may become pecuniarily interested in
any transaction in which Buyer, the Sellers Representative, the Company or
any of the Equity Holders may be interested, and contract and lend money to
Buyer, the Sellers Representative, the Company or any Equity Holder and
otherwise act as fully and freely as though it were not Escrow Agent under
this Agreement. Nothing herein shall preclude the Escrow Agent from acting in
any other capacity for Buyer, the Sellers Representative, the Company or any
of the Equity Holders or for any other entity.

 

5.13 _Authorized Signatures_. Contemporaneously with the execution and
delivery of this Agreement and, if necessary, from time to time thereafter,
Buyer and the Sellers Representative shall each execute and deliver to the
Escrow Agent a Certificate of Incumbency substantially in the form of
_Schedule II_ hereto (a " _Certificate of Incumbency_ ") for the purpose of
establishing the identity and authority of persons entitled to issue notices,
instructions or directions to the Escrow Agent on behalf of Buyer or the
Sellers Representative, as applicable. Until such time as the Escrow
Agent shall receive an amended Certificate of Incumbency replacing any
Certificate of Incumbency theretofore delivered to the Escrow Agent, the
Escrow Agent shall be fully protected in relying, without further inquiry, on
the most recent Certificate of Incumbency furnished to the Escrow Agent.
Whenever this Agreement provides for joint written notices, joint written
instructions or other joint actions to be delivered to the Escrow Agent, the
Escrow Agent shall be fully protected in relying, without further inquiry, on
any joint written notice, instructions or action executed by persons named in
such Certificates of Incumbency.

5.14 _Tax Reporting of Interest (or Other Income) Accrued with respect to the
Escrow Fund_. The Sellers Representative and Buyer acknowledge that all
amounts in the Escrow Fund shall be treated for tax purposes as owned by the
Equity Holders. The Escrow Agent shall, for each calendar year (or portion
thereof) that the Escrow Fund is in existence,

 



\- 10 -   report the income of the Escrow Fund on IRS Form 1099. The Form 1099
prepared by the Escrow Agent shall show the Escrow Agent as payor and the
Sellers Representative as payee. Except for the delivery of Form 1099s, the
Escrow Agent shall have no duty to prepare or file any Federal or state tax
return or report with respect to any funds held under this Agreement or any
earnings thereon. With respect to the preparation and delivery of Form 1099s
and all matters pertaining to the reporting of earnings on funds held under
this Agreement, the Escrow Agent shall be entitled to request and receive
written instructions from the Sellers Representative and the Escrow Agent
shall be entitled to rely conclusively and without further inquiry on such
written instructions. Further, neither Buyer nor the Sellers Representative
shall take any position in connection with the preparation, filing or audit
of any Tax Return that is in any way inconsistent with the foregoing
determination or the Form 1099 provided by the Escrow Agent.

_$140 million First Lien Facility_

_$55 million Second Lien Facility _

_Commitment Letter_

Ladies and Gentlemen:

You have advised Credit Suisse AG (acting through such of its affiliates or
branches as it deems appropriate, " _CS_ ") and Credit Suisse Securities (USA)
LLC (" _CS Securities_ " and, together with CS and their respective
affiliates, " _Credit Suisse_ ", " _we_ " or " _us_ ") that you intend to
acquire (the " _Acquisition_ "), directly or indirectly through one or more of
your subsidiaries, all of the equity interests of a company previously
identified to us as "Racehorse" (the " _Company_ "), from the existing
shareholders of the Company (collectively, the " _Seller_ ")and to consummate
the other Transactions (such term and each other capitalized term used but
not defined herein having the meaning assigned to such term in the Summary of
Principal Terms and Conditions attached hereto as Exhibit A (the " _First Lien
Facility Term Sheet_ ") or in the Summary of Principal Terms and Conditions
attached hereto as Exhibit B (the " _Second Lien Facility Term Sheet_ " and,
together with the Senior Facilities Term Sheet, the " _Term Sheets_ ")).

You have further advised us that, in connection therewith, the Borrower will
obtain (a) the senior secured first lien term loan facility (the " _First
Lien Facility_ ") described in the First Lien Term Sheet, in an aggregate
principal amount of $140 million and (b) the senior secured second lien term
loan facility (the " _Second Lien Facility_ ") described in the Second Lien
Term Sheet, in an aggregate principal amount of $55 million. The First Lien
Facility and the Second Lien Facility are collectively referred to herein as
the " _Facilities_ ".



   1. | _Commitments_. 
---|--- 

In connection with the foregoing, CS is pleased to advise you of its
commitment to provide the entire principal amount of the Facilities, upon the
terms set forth or referred to in this commitment letter (including the Term
Sheets and other attachments hereto, this " _Commitment Letter_ ") and
subject only to the conditions described in paragraph 6 of this Commitment
Letter. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if at any time prior to the occurrence
of the Closing Date, the Investor or any of its subsidiaries actually
receives Net Cash Proceeds (as defined below) of any  indebtedness for borrowed money (excluding (i) borrowings under the
Investors asset-based working capital facility, as the same may be entered
into, or amended, amended and restated, increased, replaced or refinanced
from time to time (the " _ABL Facility_ _"_ ), (ii) intercompany indebtedness,
(iii) ordinary course borrowings under any other liquidity or working capital
facility, (iv) ordinary course capital lease, purchase money or equipment
financings or (v) other indebtedness in an amount not to exceed $10,000,000)
or Net Cash Proceeds of issuances of equity securities by the Investor or any
of its subsidiaries (other than intercompany issuances or issuances under
employee stock plans or other benefit or employee incentive arrangements), in
an aggregate amount equal to or greater than the amount of the commitments
under the Second Lien Facility, then the commitments with respect to the
Facilities shall be automatically and permanently reduced by an amount equal
to the amount of such Net Cash Proceeds; _provided_ that if the aggregate
amount of such Net Cash Proceeds is less than the aggregate committed amount
of both of the Facilities, such amount shall _first_ reduce the commitments
under the Second Lien Facility and _second_ reduce the commitments under the
First Lien Facility until the commitments with respect to the First Lien
Facility are not less than $125 million. In addition, you may terminate your
commitments with respect to the Facilities in whole but may not reduce such
commitments in part except as contemplated by the foregoing sentence. For
purposes hereof, " _Net Cash Proceeds_ " shall mean, with respect to any
person: (a) with respect to a sale or other disposition of any assets of such
person, the excess, if any, of (i) the cash received in connection
therewith (including any cash received by way of deferred payment pursuant
to, or by monetization of, a note receivable or otherwise, but only as and
when so received) over (ii) the sum of (A) payments made to retire any debt
that is secured by such asset and that is required to be repaid in connection
with the sale thereof (other than loans or commitments outstanding under the
Facilities), (B) the reasonable expenses incurred by such person in connection
therewith, (C) taxes reasonably estimated to be payable in connection with
such transaction, and (D) the amount of reserves established by such person in
good faith and pursuant to commercially reasonable practices for adjustment in
respect of the sale price of such asset or assets in accordance with
applicable generally accepted accounting principles, provided that if the
amount of such reserves exceeds the amounts charged against such reserve, then
such excess, upon the determination thereof, shall then constitute Net Cash
Proceeds; (b) with respect to the incurrence of indebtedness for borrowed
money by such person, the excess, if any, of (i) cash received by such person
in connection with such incurrence over (ii) the sum of (A) payments made to
retire any debt that is required to be repaid in connection with such issuance
(other than loans or commitments outstanding under the Facilities) and (B) the
underwriting discounts and commissions and other reasonable expenses incurred
by such person in connection with such issuance; and (c) with respect to the
issuance of equity securities, the excess of (i) the cash received in
connection with such issuance over (ii) the underwriting discounts and
commissions and other reasonable expenses incurred by such person in
connection with such issuance.



   2. | _Titles and Roles_. 
---|--- 

You hereby appoint (a) CS Securities to act, and CS Securities hereby agrees
to act, as sole bookrunner and sole lead arranger for the Facilities and (b)
CS to act, and CS hereby agrees to act, as sole administrative agent for the
Facilities and sole collateral agent for the Facilities, in each case upon
the terms and subject to the conditions set forth or referred to in this
Commitment Letter. Each of CS Securities and CS, in such capacities, will
perform the duties and exercise the authority customarily performed and
exercised by it in such roles. You agree

 



2  that no other titles will be awarded and no compensation (other than that
expressly contemplated by this Commitment Letter and the Fee Letter referred
to below) will be paid in connection with the Facilities unless you and we
shall so agree. Notwithstanding the foregoing, you may appoint one additional
lead arranger or bookrunner in respect of the Facilities within five business
days after the date of your acceptance of this letter; provided that (i) such
additional lead arranger or bookrunner shall be entitled to not more than 50%
of the economics with respect to each Facility (with the economics allocated
to Credit Suisse reduced by an amount equal to the economics granted to such
additional lead arranger or bookrunner), (ii) such additional lead arranger or
bookrunner shall have assumed commitments hereunder at least commensurate with
its percentage of the economics, which commitments shall be allocated pro
rata to the Facilities, and the commitments of CS hereunder shall be reduced
by the amount so assumed, and (iii) Credit Suisse shall have "lead left"
placement in any and all marketing materials in connection with the
Facilities and shall have the role and responsibilities conventionally
associated with such "lead left" placement, including maintaining sole
physical books.



   3. | _Syndication_. 
---|--- 

CS Securities reserves the right, commencing on the date that is 60 days
after the Closing Date, to syndicate all or a portion of CSs commitment with
respect to the Facilities to a group of banks, financial institutions and
other institutional lenders (together with CS, the " _Lenders_ ") identified
by us in consultation with you (excluding institutions identified by you in
writing to us prior to the date hereof (the " _Disqualified Institution_
s")). We intend to commence preparations for such syndication efforts promptly
following the Closing Date and to launch such syndication 60 days following
the Closing Date, and you agree to actively assist us from and after such
date until the earlier of the date on which a Successful Syndication (as
defined in the Fee Letter) occurs and the date that is 120 days following the
Closing Date (such earlier date, the " _Syndication Date_ _")_ in our efforts
to complete a Successful Syndication. Such assistance shall include (a) your
using commercially reasonable efforts to ensure that any syndication efforts
benefit materially from your and your affiliates existing
lending relationships and the existing lending relationships of the Company
and the Investor, (b) direct contact between senior management,
representatives and advisors of you, the Borrower and the Company (and your
using commercially reasonable efforts to cause direct contact between senior
management, representatives and advisors of the Investor) and the proposed
Lenders, (c) assistance by you, the Borrower and the Company (and your using
commercially reasonable efforts to cause the assistance by the Investor) in
the preparation of a Confidential Information Memorandum for the Facilities
and other marketing materials and presentations to be used in connection with
the syndication (the " _Information Materials_ "), (d) your providing or
causing to be provided projections of Holdings and its subsidiaries for the
years 2013 through 2018 and for the seven quarters beginning with the second
quarter of 2013, in each case in form and substance reasonably satisfactory
to CS Securities, (e) on or promptly after that date which is 60 days
following the Closing Date, your applying, or causing the Borrower to apply,
for the receipt, on an expedited basis, of a public corporate credit rating
from Standard and Poors Ratings Service (" _S andP_") and a public corporate
family rating from Moodys Investors Service, Inc. (" _Moody s_"), in each
case with respect to the Borrower, and public ratings for each of the
Facilities from each of SandP and Moodys, (f) the hosting, with CS Securities,
of one or more meetings of prospective Lenders, and (g) from the date hereof
to the Syndication Date, your ensuring that there are not any issues of debt
securities or commercial bank or other credit facilities of Holdings, the

 



3  Borrower, the Company or their respective subsidiaries being announced,
offered, placed or arranged if such announcement, offering, placement or
arrangement would, in the reasonable judgment of Credit Suisse, be expected
to materially impair the primary syndication of the Facilities (it being
understood that none of the announcement, offering, placing or arranging of
(x) working capital or liquidity facilities, (y) letters of credit or letter
of credit facilities or (z) ordinary course capital lease, purchase money or
equipment financings would reasonably expect to materially impair the primary
syndication of the Facilities).

 

You agree, at the request of CS Securities, to assist in the preparation of a
version of the Information Materials to be used in connection with the
syndication of the Facilities, consisting exclusively of information and
documentation that is either (a) publicly available or of a type that would be
publicly available if the Borrower and the Company were public
reporting companies or (b) not material with respect to Holdings, the
Borrower, the Company or their respective subsidiaries or any of their
respective securities for purposes of foreign, United States Federal and state
securities laws (all such Information Materials being " _Public Lender
Information_ "). Any information and documentation that is not Public Lender
Information is referred to herein as " _Private Lender Information_ ".
Before distribution of any Information Materials, you agree to execute and
deliver or cause to be executed and delivered to CS Securities, (i) a letter
in which you authorize distribution of the Information Materials to Lenders
employees willing to receive Private Lender Information and (ii) a separate
letter in which you or the Company authorize distribution of Information
Materials containing solely Public Lender Information and represent that such
Information Materials do not contain any Private Lender Information, which
letter shall in each case include a customary "10b-5" representation. You
further agree that each document to be disseminated by CS Securities to any
Lender in connection with the Facilities will, at the request of CS
Securities, be identified by you as either (A) containing Private Lender
Information or (B) containing solely Public Lender Information. You
acknowledge that the following documents contain solely Public
Lender Information (unless you notify us promptly prior to their intended
distribution that any such document contains Private Lender Information): (1)
drafts and final definitive documentation with respect to the Facilities,
including term sheets; (2) administrative materials prepared by Credit Suisse
for prospective Lenders (such as a lender meeting invitation, bank allocation,
if any, and funding and closing memoranda); and (3) notification of changes in
the terms of the Facilities.

CS Securities will manage all aspects of any syndication in consultation with
you, including decisions as to the selection of institutions (other than
Disqualified Institutions) to be approached and when they will be approached,
when their commitments will be accepted, which institutions will participate,
the allocation of the commitments among the Lenders, any naming rights and
the amount and distribution of fees among the Lenders. To assist CS Securities
in its syndication efforts, you agree promptly to prepare and provide (and to
use commercially reasonable efforts to cause the Company promptly to provide)
to CS Securities all information with respect to Holdings, the Borrower, the
Company and their respective subsidiaries, the Transactions and the other
transactions contemplated hereby, including all financial information and
projections (the " _Projections_ "), as CS Securities may reasonably request
and as is customarily required in connection with the syndication of
facilities similar to the Facilities. For the avoidance of doubt and
notwithstanding anything to the contrary provided herein, in no event shall
you or any of your affiliates be required to participate in any bank meetings,
ratings agency presentations or road shows prior to the date that is the 60th
day following the Closing Date. 

 



4 ---|--- 

You hereby represent and covenant (with respect to information relating to
the Company and its subsidiaries, to the best of your knowledge) that (a) all
written information or formally presented with respect to the Borrower,
Holdings, the Company and its subsidiaries, other than the Projections and
information of a general economic or industry nature (the " _Information_ ")
that has been or will be made available to Credit Suisse by or on behalf of
you or any of your representatives is or will be, when furnished, complete
and correct in all material respects and does not or will not, taken as a
whole, when furnished, contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit
to state a material fact necessary in order to make the statements contained
therein, taken as a whole, not materially misleading in light of the
circumstances under which such statements are made and (b) the Projections
that have been or will be made available to Credit Suisse by or on behalf of
you or any of your representatives have been or will be prepared in good faith
based upon accounting principles consistent with the historical audited
financial statements of the Company (except as otherwise disclosed in writing
in such Projections) and upon assumptions that are reasonable at the time
made and at the time the related Projections are made available to Credit
Suisse, it being recognized by Credit Suisse that such Projections are not to
be viewed as facts or as a guarantee of performance or achievement of any
particular results, that the Projections are subject to significant
uncertainties and contingencies many of which are beyond your control, that
actual results during the period or periods covered by any such Projections
may differ significantly from the projected results, and that no assurance can
be given that the projected results will be realized. You agree that if at any
time prior to the later of (i) the closing of the Facilities and (ii) the
Syndication Date, any of the representations in the preceding sentence would
be incorrect if the Information and Projections were being furnished, and such
representations were being made, at such time, then you will
promptly supplement the Information and the Projections so that such
representations will be correct under those circumstances (with respect to
information relating to the Company and its subsidiaries, to the best of your
knowledge). In arranging and syndicating the Facilities, we will be entitled
to use and rely primarily on the Information and the Projections without
responsibility for independent verification thereof.

 



   5. | _Fees_. 
---|--- 

As consideration for CSs commitment hereunder, and our agreements to perform
the services described herein, you agree to pay (or to cause the Borrower to
pay) to CS Securities and CS the fees set forth in this Commitment Letter, in
the Fee Letter dated the date hereof and delivered herewith with respect to
the Facilities (the " _Fee Letter_ ").



   6. | _Conditions Precedent_. 
---|--- 
 

CSs commitment hereunder, and our agreements to perform the services
described herein, are subject to (a) there not having occurred since May 31,
2013 any Company Material Adverse Effect (as defined below), (b) execution and
delivery of definitive documentation with respect to the Facilities reflecting
the terms set forth in this Commitment Letter and the Fee Letter, and (c) the
other conditions set forth in Exhibit C hereto.

 



5 For the purposes hereof, "Company Material Adverse Effect" means any
change, circumstance, development, effect or occurrence that has or would
reasonably be expected to be materially adverse to the business, assets,
liabilities, financial condition or results of operations of the Company and
its subsidiaries, taken as a whole; provided, however, that the term "Company

development, effect or occurrence to the extent caused by (i) changes or
proposed changes in laws, regulations or interpretations thereof or decisions
by courts or any governmental authority, (ii) changes or proposed changes in
GAAP, (iii) actions or omissions of the Company taken with the consent of the
Investor and Credit Suisse (provided that Credit Suisses consent shall not

Agreement or the documents entered into pursuant thereto which were delivered
to Credit Suisse prior to the date hereof, including the impact thereof on
relationships, contractual or otherwise, with, or actual or potential loss or
impairment of, clients, customers, suppliers, distributors, partners,
financing sources, officers or other employees and/or consultants on revenue,
profitability and cash flows, or actions or omissions of the Investor and its
affiliates, (iv) general economic conditions, including changes in the credit,
debt, financial, capital or reinsurance markets (including changes in
interest or exchange rates, prices of any security or market index or any
disruption of such markets), in each case, in the United States or anywhere
else in the world, (v) events or conditions generally affecting the
industries in which the Company and its subsidiaries operate, (vi) global,

sabotage or terrorism or military actions, (vii) pandemics, earthquakes,
hurricanes, tornados or other natural disasters, (viii) the announcement or
pendency of the Purchase Agreement or the transactions contemplated thereby or

predictions of revenue, earnings, cash flow or cash position (provided, that
(A) the matters described in clauses (i), (ii), (iv), (v), (vi) and (vii)
shall be included in the term "Company Material Adverse Effect" to the extent
any such matter has a disproportionate, materially adverse impact on the
business, assets, financial condition or results of operations of the Company
and its subsidiaries, taken as a whole, relative to other participants in the
last mile residential logistics services industry, and (B) clause (x) will not
prevent a determination that any change or effect underlying any such change
or failure, as applicable, has resulted in a Company Material Adverse Effect,
to the extent such change or effect is not otherwise excluded from this
definition of Company Material Adverse Effect).

Notwithstanding anything in this Commitment Letter (including each of the
exhibits hereto), the Fee Letter or the definitive documentation or any other
agreement or undertaking related to the Facilities to the contrary, (a) the
only representations relating to the Company and its subsidiaries, businesses
and assets, the accuracy of which shall be a condition to the availability of
the Facilities on the Closing Date, shall be (i) such of the representations
made by or on behalf of the Seller, the Company and its subsidiaries in the
Purchase Agreement as are material to the interests of the Lenders, but only
to the extent that you have (or an affiliate of

 



6  yours has) the right to terminate (or not perform) your (or its) obligations
under the Purchase Agreement as a result of a breach of such representations
in the Purchase Agreement (the " _Purchase Agreement Representations_ ") and
(ii) the Specified Representations (as defined below) and (b) the terms of the
definitive documentation for the Facilities shall be in a form such that they
do not impair the availability of the Facilities on the Closing Date if the
conditions set forth clauses (a)  (d) of this Section 6 are satisfied (it
being understood that to the extent any Collateral cannot be delivered, or a
security interest therein cannot be perfected, on the Closing Date after your
use of commercially reasonable efforts to do so, the delivery of, or
perfection of a security interest in, such Collateral (other than Collateral a
security interest in which can be perfected by the filing of a UCC financing
statement, the filing of short form security agreements with the United States
Patent and Trademark Office or the United States Copyright Office or the
delivery of certificates representing equity interests of the Borrower and
subsidiaries of the Borrower organized in the United States) shall not
constitute a condition precedent to the availability of the Facilities on the
Closing Date, but such Collateral shall instead be required to be delivered,
or a security interest therein perfected, after the Closing Date pursuant to
arrangements and timing to be mutually agreed by the parties hereto acting
reasonably. For purposes hereof, " _Specified Representations_ " means the
representations and warranties of the Borrower and the Guarantors set forth in
the Term Sheets relating to corporate existence, power and authority, due
authorization, execution and delivery, in each case as they relate to the
entering into and performance of the definitive documentation for the
Facilities, the enforceability of such documentation, Federal Reserve margin

Corrupt Practices Act, the Investment Company Act, no conflicts between the
definitive documentation for the Facilities and the organization documents of
the Loan Parties, instruments governing the terms of material debt for
borrowed money of the Investor or applicable law, solvency of Holdings, the
Borrower and the Borrowers subsidiaries on a consolidated basis, and, subject
to the limitations set forth in the prior sentence, creation, validity,
perfection and priority of security interests. This paragraph, and the
provisions herein, shall be referred to as the " _Limited Conditionality
Provisions_."



   7. | _Indemnification; Expenses_. 
---|--- 
 

You agree (a) to indemnify and hold harmless Credit Suisse and its officers,
directors, employees, agents, advisors, representatives, controlling persons,
members and successors and assigns (each, an " _Indemnified Person_ ") from
and against any and all losses, claims, damages, liabilities and expenses,
joint or several, to which any such Indemnified Person may become subject
arising out of or in connection with this Commitment Letter, the Fee Letter,
the Transactions, the Facilities or any related transaction or any claim,
litigation, investigation or proceeding relating to any of the
foregoing, regardless of whether any such Indemnified Person is a party
thereto (and regardless of whether such matter is initiated by a third party
or by Holdings, the Company or any of their respective affiliates or equity
holders), and to reimburse each such Indemnified Person upon demand for any
reasonable legal or other expenses incurred in connection with investigating
or defending any of the foregoing or entering into or enforcing the Commitment
Letter or the Fee Letter; _provided_ that (i) the foregoing indemnity will
not, as to any Indemnified Person, apply to losses, claims, damages,
liabilities or related expenses to the extent (a) they are found in a final,
non-appealable judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction to have resulted
from (X) the willful misconduct or gross negligence of such Indemnified Person
or such Indemnified Persons officers, directors, employees, agents, advisors,
representatives, 

 



7  controlling persons or successors or assignees (any such person, a "
_Related Person_ ") or (Y) a material breach by such Indemnified Person of its
express obligations under this Commitment Letter or (b) arising from or in
connection with disputes solely among or between Indemnified Persons (other
than actions against Credit Suisse in its capacity as agent or arranger or
similar capacity in connection with the Facilities) not relating to any acts
or omissions by you or any of your affiliates or your or its Related Persons
and (ii) your obligation to reimburse the Indemnified Persons for legal
expenses shall be limited to the fees, charges and disbursements of one
counsel to all Indemnified Persons (and, if reasonably necessary, of one
regulatory counsel and one local counsel in any relevant jurisdiction) and,
solely in the case of an actual or potential conflict of interest of which
you are notified in writing, of one additional counsel (and if reasonably
necessary, of one regulatory counsel and one local counsel in any relevant
jurisdiction) to the affected Indemnified Persons and (b) if the Closing Date
occurs, to reimburse Credit Suisse for all reasonable and documented out-of-
pocket expenses (including, but not limited to, expenses of Credit Suisses
due diligence investigation, consultants fees, syndication expenses, travel
expenses and fees, and disbursements and other charges of outside counsel
(limited to one counsel and, if reasonably necessary, one regulatory counsel
and one local counsel in any relevant jurisdiction)), incurred in connection
with the Facilities and the preparation and negotiation of this Commitment
Letter, the Fee Letter, the definitive documentation for the Facilities and
any ancillary documents and security arrangements in connection therewith. You
agree that, notwithstanding any other provision of this Commitment Letter, no
Indemnified Person shall have any liability (whether direct or indirect, in
contract or tort or otherwise) to you or your subsidiaries or affiliates or to
your or their respective equity holders or creditors or any other
person arising out of, related to or in connection with any aspect of the
Transactions, except to the extent of direct, as opposed to special, indirect,
consequential or punitive, damages determined in a final, non-appealable
judgment by a court of competent jurisdiction to have resulted from such
Indemnified Persons gross negligence or willful misconduct. You will not be
responsible to us or any other Indemnified Person or any other person or
entity for any special, indirect, consequential or punitive, damages which
may be alleged as a result of this Commitment Letter, the Fee Letters or the
Transactions; provided, that your indemnity and reimbursement obligations
under this Section 7 shall not be limited by this sentence.

the Borrower intends to obtain (i) the First Lien Facility as described and

   | 
   _Incremental First Lien Facility_ : |  | The Borrower shall be
entitled, subject to satisfaction of customary conditions, on one or more
occasions, to incur additional first lien term loans (the " _Additional First
Lien Loans_ ") under the Incremental First Lien Facility or under a new first
lien loan facility to be included in the First Lien Facility in an aggregate
principal amount of up to $30,000,000 and to have the same guarantees as,

First Lien Facility; _provided_ that (i) no default or event of default exists
or would exist after giving effect thereto, (ii) the Borrower shall be in pro
forma compliance with the Financial Maintenance Covenants and the First Lien
Debt (to be defined) to EBITDA (to be defined) ratio on a pro forma basis
shall not exceed 4.00:1.00, in each case on the date of incurrence and for the
most recent determination period, after giving effect to any such Additional
First Lien Loans and other customary and appropriate pro forma adjustment
events, including any acquisitions or dispositions after the beginning of the
relevant determination period but prior to or substantially simultaneously
with the borrowing of such Additional First Lien Loans, (iii) the Additional
First Lien Loans and guarantees thereof will rank pari passu in right of

ratable basis with (and on the same Collateral securing) the First Lien
Facility, (iv) the maturity date of the Additional First Lien Loans shall be
no earlier than the maturity date of the First Lien Facility, (v) the average
life to maturity of the Additional First Lien Loans shall be no shorter than

First Lien Facility Term Sheet

  



A-2  ---|---|--- 
    |  | such Additional Term Loans does not exceed the "yield" at such
time on the Term Facility by more than 50 basis points (with "yield" being
determined by the Agent taking into account the applicable margin, upfront
fees, any original issue discount and any LIBOR or ABR floors) and (viii) the
other terms and documentation in respect thereof, to the extent not consistent
with the First Lien Facility, shall otherwise be reasonably satisfactory to
the Agent. The Borrower may seek commitments in respect of Additional First
Lien Loans from existing Lenders (each of which shall be entitled to agree or
decline to participate in its sole discretion) and, subject to the Agents
consent (not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed) additional banks,
financial institutions and other institutional lenders who will become Lenders
in connection therewith. In addition, the Borrower shall be entitled, subject
to satisfaction of customary conditions, to establish a revolving credit
facility under the definitive documentation for the First Lien Facility, on
terms and subject to conditions to be agreed; provided that the amount of
commitments with respect to any such revolving credit facility, together with
the principal amount of any Additional First Lien Term Loans, shall not exceed
$30,000,000 in the aggregate; and provided further that, for purposes of
determining pro forma compliance with the Financial Maintenance Covenants and
the First Lien Debt to EBITDA ratio referred to above, such revolving credit
facility shall be deemed to have been fully drawn. 
   | 
   _Refinancing Facility_ : |  | The definitive documentation will
permit the Borrower to refinance loans under the First Lien Facility
(including any Additional Loans) from time to time, in whole or part, with

the Borrower, the Agent (not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed) and

Refinancing Facility does not mature prior to the maturity date of, or have a
shorter weighted average life than, loans under the applicable portion of the
First Lien Facility being refinanced, (ii) the proceeds of such Refinancing
Facility are immediately applied to permanently repay in whole or in part the
portion of the First Lien Facility being refinanced and shall not be in an
aggregate principal amount greater than the aggregate principal amount of the
First Lien Facility being refinanced, (iii) there are no direct or indirect
obligors in respect of the Refinancing Facilities that are not the Borrower or
Guarantors and (iv) the other terms and conditions of such Refinancing
Facility (excluding pricing and optional prepayment or redemption terms) are
substantially identical to, or no more favorable (taken as a whole) to the
investors providing such Refinancing Facility than, those applicable to the
portion of the First Lien Facility being refinanced (except for covenants or
other 
 



First Lien Facility Term Sheet

  



A-3  ---|---|--- 
    |  | provisions applicable only to periods after the latest final
maturity date of the First Lien Facility existing at the time of such
refinancing). 
   | 
  Purpose: |  | The proceeds of the First Lien Facility will be used by
the Borrower, on the date of the borrowing under the Facilities (the "
_Closing Date_ "), together with the proceeds of the Second Lien Facility, if
any, and of the Equity Contribution, solely (a) to repay the Existing Debt,
(b) to pay Acquisition Consideration and (c) to pay the Transaction Costs. 
   | 
  Availability: |  | The full amount of the First Lien Facility must be
drawn in a single drawing on the Closing Date. Amounts borrowed under the
First Lien Facility (other than under any incremental revolving facility)
that are repaid or prepaid may not be reborrowed. 
   | 
   _Interest Rates and Fees_ : |  | As set forth on Annex A-I hereto. 
   | 
   _Default Rate_ : |  | The applicable interest rate plus 2.0% per
annum. 
   | 
  

Final Maturity

_and Amortization_ :

 |  | The First Lien Facility will mature on the date that is 6 years
after the Closing Date, and will amortize in equal quarterly installments in
an aggregate annual amount equal to 1.0% of the original principal amount of
the First Lien Facility with the balance payable on the maturity date of the
First Lien Facility; _provided_ that the First Lien Facility documentation
shall provide the right for the Borrower to extend maturities pursuant to one
or more tranches with only the consent of the respective extending Lenders;
_provided_ that each Lender under the tranche that is being extended shall
have the opportunity to participate in such extension on the same terms and
conditions as each other Lender under such tranche. 
   | 
   _Guarantees_ : |  | All obligations of the Borrower under the First
Lien Facility and under any interest rate protection or other hedging
arrangements entered into with the Agent, the Arranger, an entity that is a
Lender at the time of such transaction, or any affiliate of any of the
foregoing (" _Hedging Arrangements_ ") will be unconditionally guaranteed (the
" _Guarantees_ ") by (i) Holdings and (ii) each existing and subsequently
acquired or organized, direct and indirect domestic subsidiary of the Borrower
(collectively, the " _Subsidiary Guarantors_ " and, together with Holdings,
the " _Guarantors_ "); provided that the Guarantors shall not include (a) any
subsidiary that is prohibited or restricted by applicable law, rule or
regulation or by any contractual obligation existing on the Closing Date or at
the time of acquisition thereof after the Closing Date (to the extent not
entered into in contemplation of such acquisition), in each case, from
guaranteeing the Facilities or which would require governmental (including
regulatory) consent, approval, license or authorization to provide a
Guarantee unless such consent has been received, (b) any direct or indirect
domestic subsidiary of a foreign subsidiary or (c) any domestic

    |  | subsidiary substantially all of the assets of which would
constitute the equity of foreign subsidiaries (a " _FSHCO_ "). Notwithstanding
the foregoing, additional subsidiaries may be excluded from the guarantee
requirements in circumstances where the Borrower and the Agent reasonably
agree that the cost of providing such a Guarantee is excessive in relation to
the value afforded thereby. 
   | 
   _Security_ : |  |

The First Lien Facility, the Guarantees and any Hedging Arrangements will be
secured by substantially all the assets of Holdings, the Borrower and each
Subsidiary Guarantor, whether owned on the Closing Date or thereafter acquired
(collectively, the " _Collateral_ "), including but not limited to: (a) a
perfected first-priority pledge of all the equity interests of the Borrower,
(b) a perfected first-priority pledge of all the equity interests held by
Holdings, the Borrower or any Subsidiary Guarantor and (c) perfected first-
priority security interests in substantially all tangible and intangible

not limited to accounts receivable, inventory, equipment, general intangibles,
investment property, intellectual property, real property, cash, deposit
and securities accounts, commercial tort claims, letter of credit rights,
intercompany notes and proceeds of the foregoing).



Notwithstanding anything to the contrary, the Collateral shall exclude the
following: (i) any fee-owned real property with a fair market value of less
than an amount to be agreed (with all required mortgages being permitted to
be delivered post-closing) and all leasehold interests (including requirements
to deliver landlord lien waivers, estoppels and collateral access letters);
(ii) motor vehicles and other assets subject to certificates of title, letter
of credit rights with a value of less than an amount to be agreed (except to
the extent perfection can be achieved by filing a UCC-1 financing statement)
and commercial tort claims with a value of less than an amount to be
agreed; (iii) pledges and security interests prohibited by applicable law,
rule or regulation; (iv) equity interests in any person other than wholly
owned subsidiaries to the extent not permitted by the terms of such persons
organizational or joint venture documents; (v) any lease, license or other
agreement or any property subject to a purchase money security interest or
similar arrangement to the extent that a grant of a security interest therein
would violate or invalidate such lease, license or agreement or purchase
money arrangement or create a right of termination in favor of any other party
thereto (other than the Borrower or a Guarantor) after giving effect to the
applicable anti-assignment provisions of the Uniform Commercial Code other
than proceeds thereof, (vi) those assets as to which the Agent and the
Borrower reasonably agree that the cost of obtaining such a security interest
or perfection thereof are excessive in relation to the benefit to the
Lenders of

    |  |

the security to be afforded thereby; (vii) in excess of 65% of the voting
capital stock of (A) any subsidiaries not organized under the laws of the
United States or any state thereof or (B) any FSHCO; (viii) any of the capital
stock of (A) indirect subsidiaries (not directly owned by a Borrower or a
Guarantor), to the extent not organized under the laws of the United States or
any state thereof or (B) any direct or indirect subsidiary organized under
the laws of the United States or any state thereof of a subsidiary not
organized under the laws of the United States or any state thereof; (ix) any
governmental licenses (but not the proceeds thereof) or state or local
franchises, charters and authorizations, to the extent security interests in
such licenses, franchises, charters or authorizations are prohibited or
restricted thereby after giving effect to the applicable anti-assignment
provisions of the Uniform Commercial Code other than proceeds thereof, (x)
"intent-to-use" trademark applications; and (xi) other exceptions to be
mutually agreed upon. In addition, in no event shall (a) control
agreements or control or similar arrangements be required with respect to
deposit or securities accounts, (b) notices be required to be sent to account
debtors or other contractual third-parties prior to the occurrence and during
the continuance of an event of default, (c) perfection (except to the extent
perfected through the filling of Uniform Commercial Code financing statements)
be required with respect to letter of credit rights and commercial tort
claims, or (d) security documents governed by the laws of a jurisdiction
other than the United States or any state thereof be required.



The relative rights and remedies in the Collateral among the Lenders and the
lenders under the Second Lien Facility will be set forth in a customary
intercreditor agreement on terms to be mutually agreed. 

   | 
   _Mandatory Prepayments_ : |  | Loans under the First Lien Facility
and the Second Lien Facility shall be prepaid in accordance with the
"waterfall" provision described in the following paragraph with (a) 50% of

3.50:1.00 respectively, (b) 100% of the Net Cash Proceeds of all non-
ordinary course asset sales or other dispositions of property by Holdings and
its subsidiaries in excess of an amount to be agreed (including proceeds from
the sale of equity securities of any subsidiary of the Borrower and insurance

financings of the type contemplated hereby for borrowers of creditworthiness
similar to the Borrower and other exceptions to be agreed upon and (y) the
right to reinvest such proceeds (including to make permitted acquisitions and
other investments), if such proceeds are reinvested (or committed to be
reinvested) within 12 months after receipt of such proceeds and, if so
committed, so

long as reinvestment is actually completed at least 18 months after receipt of
such proceeds), (c) following the occurrence of a Successful Syndication,
100% of the Net Cash Proceeds of issuances, offerings or placements of debt
obligations for borrowed money of Holdings and its subsidiaries not otherwise
permitted pursuant to the terms of the First Lien Facility (subject
to certain exceptions to be agreed) and (d) prior to the occurrence of a
Successful Syndication, 100% of the Net Cash Proceeds of (i) issuances of

Debt to EBITDA ratio of 4.00:1:00. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the above-
described mandatory prepayments shall be subject in all respects to the
provision described below under the heading "Minimum Size".

 



The above-described mandatory prepayments shall be applied _first_ , pro rata
to the remaining amortization payments under the First Lien Facility and

   |

---|---|--- 
     _Interest Rates_ : |  |

The interest rates under the First Lien Facility will be as follows:

 



At the option of the Borrower, Adjusted LIBOR plus 5.0% or ABR plus 4.0%.

 



The Borrower may elect interest periods of one, two, three or six months (or
twelve months if offered by all Lenders) for Adjusted LIBOR borrowings.



 

Calculation of interest shall be on the basis of the actual number of days
elapsed over a 360-day year (or 365- or 366-day year, as the case may be,
in the case of ABR loans) and interest shall be payable at the end of each
interest period and, in any event, at least every three months.



 

ABR is the Alternate Base Rate, which is the highest of (i) CSs Prime Rate,
(ii) the Federal Funds Effective Rate plus 1/2 of 1.0% and (iii) one-month
Adjusted LIBOR plus 1.0%.



Adjusted LIBOR will at all times include statutory reserves and shall be
deemed to be not less than 1.25% per annum. 

   | 
   _Original Issue Discount_ : |  | The loans under the First Lien
Facility will be issued to the Lenders participating in the First Lien
Facility at a price of 99.0% of their principal amount. Notwithstanding
the foregoing, (a) all calculations of interest and fees in respect of the
First Lien Facility will be calculated on the basis of their full stated
principal amount and (b) at the option of the Arranger, any original issue
discount may instead be effected in the form of an upfront fee payable to the
Lenders. 
   | 
   _Prepayment Premium_ : |  |

In the event that all or any portion of the First Lien Facility is voluntarily
prepaid, mandatorily prepaid from the proceeds of debt incurred by the
Borrower or its subsidiaries which is not otherwise permitted to be incurred
pursuant to the terms of the First Lien Facility, or is prepaid in connection
with a mandatory assignment in connection with an amendment to the First
Lien Facility, in each case prior to the first anniversary of the Closing
Date and in connection with a Repricing Transaction, such prepayments shall be
made at 101% of the total amount being prepaid.

 



"Repricing Transaction" means any prepayment of all or part of the First Lien
Facility from the proceeds of indebtedness having a lower all-in yield (taking
into account, for example, upfront fees, interest rate spreads, interest rate
benchmark floors and OID, but excluding the effect of any arrangement,
structuring, syndication or other fees payable in connection therewith that
are not shared with all lenders or holders of such replacement financing) than
the First Lien Facility, or any amendment of the First Lien Facility the
result of which is to reduce the all-in yield applicable to the First Lien
Facility.

the case of ABR loans) and interest shall be payable at the end of each
interest period and, in any event, at least every three months.
