AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER   

 AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER, dated as of December 24, 2003 (this " _Agreement_ "), by and among INVITROGEN CORPORATION, a Delaware corporation (" _Parent_ "), BASEBALL ACQUISITION CORPORATION, a Delaware corporation and wholly owned subsidiary of Parent (" _Purchaser_ "), and BIORELIANCE CORPORATION, a Delaware corporation (the " _Company_ ").  

RECITALS   

 WHEREAS, the respective Boards of Directors of the Company, Purchaser and Parent deem it advisable and in the best interests of their respective corporations and stockholders to enter into and consummate this Agreement, providing for Purchaser to acquire the Company upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth herein;  

 WHEREAS, in furtherance thereof, it is proposed that Purchaser will commence a cash tender offer (the " _Offer_ ") to acquire all shares (the " _Company Shares_ ") of the issued and outstanding common stock, $.01 par value per share, of the Company (the " _Company Common Stock_ "), for $48.00 per share of Company Common Stock or such higher price as may be paid in the Offer (the " _Per Share Amount _ "), in cash without interest, upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement and the Offer Documents (as defined in  _Section 1.1(c)_);  

 WHEREAS, also in furtherance of such acquisition, the Boards of Directors of Parent, Purchaser and the Company have each approved the merger of Purchaser with and into the Company (the " _Merger_ ") following consummation of the Offer in accordance with the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware (the " _DGCL_ ") and upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth herein;  

 WHEREAS, the Board of Directors of the Company (the " _Board of Directors_ ") has approved this Agreement and has determined that the consideration to be paid for each Company Share in the Offer and the Merger is fair to the holders of such Company Shares and to recommend that the holders of such Company Shares accept the Offer and approve this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby;  

 WHEREAS, as a condition to and an inducement to Parents and Purchasers willingness to enter into this Agreement, concurrently with the execution and delivery of this Agreement and incurring the obligations set forth herein, with the approval of the Board of Directors, Parent and Purchaser have entered into a voting and tender agreement (the " _Voting and Tender Agreement_ ") with Sidney R. Knafel and certain related stockholders of the Company (the " _Principal Stockholders_ ") under which the Principal Stockholders have, among other things, agreed to tender the Company Shares held by them in the Offer and to grant Parent and Purchaser a proxy with respect to the voting of such Company Shares, all upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in the Voting and Tender Agreement; and  

 WHEREAS, the parties hereto desire to make certain representations, warranties, covenants and agreements in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.  

 NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing, and of the representations,   ##### 

 

warranties, covenants and agreements contained herein, the parties agree as
follows:  

ARTICLE 1   

THE TENDER OFFER   

 1.1 _The Offer_.   

 (a) Provided that this Agreement shall not have been terminated in accordance with _Section 8.1_ hereof and none of the events set forth in _Annex I_ hereto shall have occurred and be existing, Purchaser shall, as promptly as reasonably practicable following the execution of this Agreement (but in any event no later than ten business days after the execution and delivery of this Agreement), commence (within the meaning of Rule 14d-2 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the " _Exchange Act_ ")) the Offer. The obligation of Purchaser to accept for payment and to pay for any Company Shares validly tendered shall be subject to the satisfaction of those conditions set forth in  _Annex I_. Purchaser expressly reserves the right from time to time, subject to _Sections 1.1(b)_ and _(c) _ hereof, to waive any such condition, to increase the Per Share Amount, or to make any other changes in the terms and conditions of the Offer. The Per Share Amount shall be net to seller in cash, without interest, subject to reduction for any applicable withholding or stock transfer taxes payable by Seller. The Company agrees that no Company Shares held by the Company or any of its subsidiaries (as defined in _Section 9.7(j)_) will be tendered pursuant to the Offer.   

 (b) Without the prior written consent of the Company, neither Parent nor Purchaser shall decrease the Per Share Amount or change the form of consideration payable in the Offer, decrease the number of Company Shares sought, amend or waive satisfaction of the Minimum Condition (as defined in  _Annex I_ ), extend the Offer (except as set forth in Section 1.1(d)) or impose additional conditions to the Offer or amend any other term of the Offer in any manner adverse to the holders of Company Shares.   

 (c) The Offer shall be made by means of an offer to purchase (the " _Offer to Purchase_ ") having only the conditions set forth in _Annex I_ hereto. As soon as practicable on the date the Offer is commenced, Parent and Purchaser shall file with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the " _SEC_ ") a Tender Offer Statement on Schedule TO (together with all amendments and supplements thereto, the " _Schedule TO_") with respect to the Offer that will comply in all material respects with the provisions of all applicable federal securities laws, and will contain (including as an exhibit) or incorporate by reference the Offer to Purchase and forms of the related letter of transmittal and summary advertisement, if any (which documents, together with any supplements or amendments thereto, and any other SEC schedule or form which is filed in connection with the Offer and related transactions, are referred to collectively herein as the " _Offer Documents_ "). Parent and Purchaser shall cause the Offer Documents to be disseminated to holders of Company Shares as required by applicable federal securities laws. Parent and Purchaser agree promptly to correct the Schedule TO or the Offer Documents if and to the extent that any shall have become false or misleading in any material respect (and the Company, with respect to written information supplied by it specifically for use in the Schedule TO or the Offer Documents, shall promptly notify Parent of any required corrections of such information and shall cooperate with Parent and Purchaser with respect to     ##### 

    

correcting such information) and to supplement the information provided by it
specifically for use in the Schedule TO or the Offer Documents to include any
information that shall become necessary in order to make the statements
therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not
misleading, and Parent and Purchaser further agree to take all steps
necessary to cause the Schedule TO, as so corrected or supplemented, to be
filed with the SEC and the Offer Documents, as so corrected or
supplemented, to be disseminated to holders of Company Shares, in each case
as and to the extent required by applicable federal securities laws. The
Company and its counsel shall be given the opportunity to review and comment
on any Offer Documents before they are filed with the SEC. The Parent shall
provide the Company in writing with any comments the Parent or its counsel
may receive from the SEC or its staff with respect to the Offer Documents
promptly after receipt of such comments.  

 (d) The Offer to Purchase shall provide for an initial expiration date of 20 business days (as defined in Rule 14d-1 under the Exchange Act) from the date of commencement, including the date of the commencement of the Offer as the first business day in accordance with Rule 14d-2 under the Exchange Act. Purchaser agrees that it shall not terminate or withdraw the Offer or extend the expiration date of the Offer unless at the expiration date of the Offer the conditions to the Offer described in _Annex I_ hereto shall not have been satisfied or earlier waived. If at the expiration date of the Offer, the conditions to the Offer described in _Annex I_  hereto shall not have been satisfied or earlier waived, Parent or Purchaser may, from time to time, for up to 10 business days on each such occasion beyond the then scheduled expiration date, extend the expiration date of the Offer until the date such conditions are satisfied or earlier waived and Parent becomes obligated to accept for payment and pay for Company Shares tendered pursuant to the Offer. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Parent or Purchaser may, without the consent of the Company, (i) extend the expiration date of the Offer (as it may be extended) for any period required by applicable rules and regulations of the SEC in connection with an increase in the consideration to be paid pursuant to the Offer and (ii) provided that Parent and Purchaser waive the conditions of the Offer described in Annex I hereto (other than the Minimum Condition and the conditions in clauses (iv) (a) and (h) of Annex I) and agree not to assert such conditions as a basis for not consummating the Offer, extend the expiration date of the Offer (as it may be extended) for up to 10 business days, if on such expiration date the conditions for the Offer described on  _Annex I_ hereto shall have been satisfied or earlier waived, but the number of Company Shares that have been validly tendered and not withdrawn, when added to the Company Shares, if any, beneficially owned by Parent represents less than 90% of the then issued and outstanding Company Shares. If at the expiration date of the Offer, any of the conditions of the Offer described in Annex I hereto (other than the Minimum Condition and the conditions in clauses (iv) (d), (e), (f) and (h) ) have not been satisfied or earlier waived, then Purchaser shall, and Parent shall cause Purchaser to extend the Offer from time to time until such conditions are satisfied or waived for a period not to exceed 20 business days after expiration of the initial Offer period. In the event the Minimum Condition is satisfied and Purchaser purchases Company Shares pursuant to the Offer, Purchaser may, in its sole discretion, provide a "subsequent offering period" of not more than 20 business days in accordance with Rule 14d-11 under the Exchange Act.   

 (e) Parent shall provide or cause to be provided to Purchaser all of the funds necessary to purchase any shares of Company Common Stock that Purchaser becomes obligated to purchase pursuant to the Offer to Purchase.       ##### 

    

 1.2 _Company Action_.   

 (a) The Company hereby approves of and consents to the Offer and represents and warrants that the Board of Directors, at a meeting or meetings duly called and held prior to the date hereof, at which all of the Directors were present, duly: (i) approved and adopted this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby, including the Offer and the Merger; (ii) recommended that the stockholders of the Company accept the Offer, tender their Company Shares pursuant to the Offer and approve this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby, including the Merger; (iii) determined that this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby, including the Offer and the Merger, are fair to and in the best interests of the stockholders of the Company; and (iv) irrevocably took all action necessary to render the limitations on business combinations contained in Section 203 of the DGCL inapplicable to Parent and Purchaser and to this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby. The Company further represents and warrants that (x) Bear, Stearns and Co. Inc., the Companys independent financial advisor (the " _Company Financial Advisor_ "), has delivered to the Board of Directors the Fairness Opinion (as defined in _Section 4.20_) and (y) a true and correct copy of such opinion has been delivered to Parent and Purchaser. The Company acknowledges that the Voting and Tender Agreement is being executed and delivered simultaneously herewith.   

 (b) The Company hereby agrees to file with the SEC, as promptly as practicable after the filing by Parent and Purchaser of the Schedule TO with respect to the Offer, a Tender Offer Solicitation/Recommendation Statement on Schedule 14D-9 (together with any amendments or supplements thereto, the " _Schedule 14D-9_") that will comply in all material respects with the provisions of all applicable federal securities laws and will include the opinion of the Company Financial Advisor referred to in _Section 1.2(a)_ hereof. The Company agrees to use its best efforts to mail such Schedule 14D-9 to the stockholders of the Company along with the Offer Documents promptly after the commencement of the Offer. The Schedule 14D-9 and the Offer Documents shall contain the recommendations of the Board of Directors described in _Section 1.2(a)_ hereof. The Company agrees promptly to correct the Schedule 14D-9 if and to the extent that it shall become false or misleading in any material respect (and each of Parent and Purchaser, with respect to written information supplied by it specifically for use in the Schedule 14D-9, shall promptly notify the Company of any required corrections of such information and cooperate with the Company with respect to correcting such information) and to supplement the information contained in the Schedule 14D-9 to include any information that shall become necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, and the Company shall take all steps necessary to cause the Schedule 14D-9 as so corrected to be filed with the SEC and disseminated to the Companys stockholders to the extent required by applicable federal securities laws. Purchaser and its counsel shall be given an opportunity to review and comment on the Schedule 14D-9 before they are filed with the SEC. The Company shall provide Parent and Purchaser in writing with any comments the Company or its counsel may receive from the SEC or its staff with respect to the Schedule 14D-9 promptly after receipt of such comments.   

 (c) In connection with the Offer, the Company shall promptly upon execution of this Agreement furnish Purchaser with mailing labels containing the names and addresses of all record holders of Company Shares, non-objecting beneficial owners list and     ##### 

    

security position listings of Company Shares held in stock depositories, each
as of a recent date, and shall promptly furnish Purchaser with such
additional information, including updated lists of stockholders, mailing
labels, security position listings and computer files, and such other
information and assistance as Purchaser or its agents may reasonably request
for the purpose of communicating the Offer to the record and beneficial
holders of Company Shares.  

 1.3 _Directors_. Promptly upon the purchase by Purchaser of any Company Shares pursuant to the Offer (the date thereof being referred to as the " _Control Date_ "), and from time to time thereafter as Company Shares are acquired by Purchaser, Purchaser shall be entitled to designate such number of directors, rounded up to the next whole number, on the Board of Directors as will give Purchaser, subject to compliance with Section 14(f) of the Exchange Act and Rule 14f-1 promulgated thereunder, representation on the Board of Directors equal to at least that number of directors which equals the product of the total number of directors on the Board of Directors (giving effect to the directors appointed or elected pursuant to this sentence and including current directors serving as officers of the Company) multiplied by the percentage that the aggregate number of Company Shares beneficially owned by Purchaser or any Affiliate of Purchaser (including for purposes of this _Section 1.3_ such Company Shares as are accepted for payment pursuant to the Offer, but excluding Company Shares held by the Company or any of its subsidiaries) bears to the number of Company Shares outstanding. At each such time, the Company will also cause each committee of the Board of Directors, if requested by Purchaser, the board of directors of each of the subsidiaries and if requested by Purchaser, each committee of such board of directors of each of the subsidiaries to include Persons designated by Purchaser constituting the same percentage of each such committee or board as Purchasers designees constitute on the Board of Directors. The Company shall, upon request by Purchaser, promptly increase the size of the Board of Directors or exercise its best efforts to secure the resignations of such number of directors as is necessary to enable Purchasers designees to be elected to the Board of Directors in accordance with the terms of this _Section 1.3_ and shall cause Purchasers designees to be so elected; provided, however, that, in the event that Purchasers designees are appointed or elected to the Board of Directors, until the Effective Time (as defined in _Section 2.3_ hereof) the Board of Directors shall have at least three directors who are directors on the date hereof and who are neither officers of the Company nor designees, stockholders, Affiliates or associates (within the meaning of the Federal securities laws) of Parent (one or more of such directors, the " _Independent Directors_ "); provided further, that if no Independent Directors remain, the other directors shall designate one Person to fill one of the vacancies who shall be neither an officer of the Company nor a designee, stockholder, Affiliate or associate of Parent, and such Person shall be deemed to be an Independent Director for purposes of this Agreement. Subject to applicable law, the Company shall promptly take all action necessary pursuant to Section 14(f) of the Exchange Act and Rule 14f-1 promulgated thereunder in order to fulfill its obligations under this _Section 1.3 _ and shall include in the Schedule 14D-9 mailed to stockholders promptly after the commencement of the Offer (or an amendment thereof or an information statement pursuant to Rule 14f-1 if Purchaser has not theretofore designated directors) such information with respect to the Company and its officers and directors as is required under Section 14(f) and Rule 14f-1 in order to fulfill its obligations under this _Section 1.3_. Purchaser will supply the Company any information with respect to itself and its nominees, officers, directors and Affiliates required by Section 14(f) and Rule 14f-1. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, following the time directors designated by Purchaser constitute a majority of the Board of Directors and prior to the Effective Time, the affirmative vote of a     ##### 

    

majority of the Independent Directors shall be required to (w) amend
or terminate this Agreement on behalf of the Company, (x) exercise or waive
any of the Companys rights or remedies hereunder, (y) extend the time for
performance of Purchasers obligations hereunder or (z) take any other action
by the Company in connection with this Agreement required to be taken by the

 1.4 _Top-Up Option_.   

 (a) The Company hereby grants to Parent and Purchaser an irrevocable option (the " _Top-Up Option_ "), such option to be exercisable only after Purchaser has purchased and paid for Company Shares constituting 88% of the then outstanding Company Shares, to purchase, at a price per share equal to the Per Share Amount, a number of shares of Company Common Stock (the " _Top-Up Option Shares_ ") that, when added to the number of shares of Company Common Stock owned by Parent or Purchaser or any wholly-owned subsidiary of Parent or Purchaser at the time of exercise of the Top-Up Option, constitutes one share of Company Common Stock more than 90% of the number of shares of Company Common Stock that will be outstanding immediately after the issuance of the Top-Up Option Shares; _provided_ ,  _however_ , that in no event shall the Top-Up Option be exercisable for more than 1,682,784 shares of Company Common Stock. The Top-Up Option may be exercised by Parent or Purchaser, in whole or in part, at any one time on or after the expiration date of the Offer and on or prior to the tenth business day after the later of the expiration date of the Offer or the expiration of any subsequent offering period; provided, however, that the obligation of the Company to deliver Top-Up Option Shares upon the exercise of the Top-Up Option is subject to the condition that no provision of any applicable Law and no judgment, injunction, order or decree shall prohibit the exercise of the Top-Up Option or the delivery of the Top-Up Option Shares in respect of such exercise. The parties shall cooperate to ensure that the issuance of the Top-Up Option Shares is accomplished consistent with all applicable legal requirements of all Governmental Entities, including compliance with an applicable exemption from registration of the Top-Up Option Shares under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the " _Securities Act_ ").   

 (b) In the event Parent or Purchaser wishes to exercise the Top-Up Option, Parent shall so notify the Company and shall set forth in such notice the number of shares of Company Common Stock that are expected to be owned by Parent, Purchaser or any wholly-owned subsidiary of Parent or Purchaser immediately preceding the purchase of the Top-Up Option Shares and a place and time for the closing of the purchase of the Top-Up Option Shares. The Company shall, as soon as practicable following receipt of such notice, notify Parent and Purchaser of the number of shares of Company Common Stock then outstanding and the number of Top-Up Option Shares. At the closing of the purchase of the Top-Up Option Shares, Parent or Purchaser, as the case may be, shall pay the Company the aggregate price required to be paid for the Top-Up Option Shares, and the Company shall cause to be issued to Parent or Purchaser a certificate representing the Top-Up Option Shares.      #####

 (b) All shares of Company Common Stock (other than shares to be canceled in accordance with _Section 3.2(c)_) shall cease to be outstanding and shall be canceled and shall cease to exist, and each holder of shares of Company Common Stock (other than Purchaser and Parent) shall thereafter cease to have any rights with respect to such shares of Company Common Stock, except, subject to _Section 3.6_, the right to receive, without interest, the Per Share Amount in accordance with  _Section 3.4_ upon the surrender of a certificate or certificates (a " _Certificate_ ") representing such shares of Company Common Stock.

(a) Immediately upon acceptance of the Company Shares pursuant to the Offer, (i) each outstanding Option (as such term is defined in the Companys Amended and Restated 1997 Incentive Plan (the " _Company Incentive Plan_ ")) to purchase Company Common Stock that was granted under the Company Incentive Plan shall vest and become immediately and fully exercisable and (ii) if so provided in the option agreement evidencing the Option and permitted by the Company Incentive Plan, each holder (the " _Optionee_ ") of such Option may surrender for cancellation, within sixty (60) days after acceptance of the Company Shares pursuant to the Offer, the Option or any portion of the Option to the extent not yet exercised (the " _Cash-Out Election_ ") and the Optionee shall be entitled to receive a cash payment (without interest and subject to applicable withholdings) in an amount equal to the excess, if any, of (A) the Option Value (as defined below) of the Shares (as such term is defined in the Company Incentive Plan), subject to the Option or portion of such Option surrendered, over (B) the aggregate exercise price of such Option or portion of such Option surrendered (the " _Cash Payment_ "). For purposes of this _Section 3.3(a)_, " _Option Value_ " means (i) with respect to each outstanding Option that is designated as an "Incentive Stock Option"      ##### 

    

within the meaning of Section 422 of the Code, the Fair Market Value (as such
term is defined in the Company Incentive Plan), on the date preceding the
date of surrender, of the Shares subject to the Option or portion of such
Option surrendered, or (ii) with respect to each outstanding Option that is
not designated as an "Incentive Stock Option" within the meaning of Section
422 of the Code, the greater of (1) the Fair Market Value (as such term is
defined in the Company Incentive Plan) on the date preceding the date of
surrender, of the Shares subject to the Option or portion of such Option

surrendered on or after the Effective Time (except for purposes of
determining the Adjusted Fair Market Value of the Shares during the 60-day
period ending on the date of acceptance of the Company Shares pursuant to the
Offer), references to " _Shares_ " in this Section 3.3(a) shall be deemed to
be references to the consideration which the Optionee shall be entitled to
receive upon exercise of the Option pursuant to _Section 3.3(c)_ below. With
respect to any Option or any portion of such Option to which an effective
Cash-Out Election is made (a " _Cash-Out Option_ "), the Parent shall take
all action necessary so that as of the date of the Cash-Out Election, each
Cash-Out Option will be canceled and in consideration of such cancellation,
the Parent shall immediately pay, or cause to be immediately paid, the Cash
Payment to the holder of such Cash-Out Option.  

 (b) At the Effective Time, each option to purchase Company Common Stock that was granted under the Companys 1995 Non-Qualified Stock Option Plan (the " _1995 Option Plan_ ") or the Companys 1988 Incentive Stock Option Plan (the " _1988 Option Plan_ " and together with the 1995 Option Plan, the " _Prior Option Plans_ ") that is outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (a " _Prior Option_ ") shall be assumed by Parent and converted into an option (an " _Assumed Option_ ") to purchase the number of shares of the common stock, $0.01 par value per share, of Parent (" _Parent Stock_ ") equal to the product of the number of shares of Company Common Stock that were issuable upon exercise of such Prior Option immediately prior to the Effective Time multiplied by the Conversion Ratio (as defined below), rounded to the nearest whole share, with 0.5 shares being rounded up. The per share exercise price of each Assumed Option shall be equal to the quotient obtained by dividing the per share exercise price of the corresponding Prior Option immediately prior to the Effective Time by the Conversion Ratio, rounded to the nearest whole cent; with 0.5 cents being rounded down; _provided_ , _however_ , that if Section 421 of the Code applies to such Prior Option by reason of its qualification under Section 422 of the Code, then the exercise price of the corresponding Assumed Option, the number of shares purchasable pursuant to Assumed Option and the terms and conditions of exercise of such Assumed Option shall be determined in order to comply with Section 424 of the Code. Except for the foregoing adjustments, all of the terms and conditions in effect for each Prior Option immediately prior to the Effective Time shall continue in effect following the assumption thereof in accordance with this Agreement and its terms (including any terms regarding adjustments for stock splits and similar transactions). For purposes of this  _Section 3.3(b)_, the term " _Conversion Ratio_ " means the ratio of (A) the Per Share Amount to (B) the Parent Stock Value. " _Parent Stock Value_ " means the volume weighted average price of Parent Stock on the Nasdaq National Market (" _Nasdaq_ ") for the trading day preceding the Effective Time, as reported by Bloomberg L.P. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall take such additional actions as are necessary under applicable Law and the applicable agreements and the Prior Option Plans to ensure that each outstanding Prior Option shall, from and after the      ##### 

    

Effective Time, represent only the right to receive the Assumed Option as
contemplated by this _Section 3.3(b) _.  

 (c) All outstanding Options with respect to which an effective Cash-Out Election has not been made immediately prior to the Effective Time (collectively, the " _1997 Plan Options_ " and, together with the Prior Options, the " _Company Options_ "), shall be assumed by Parent at the Effective Time, and each such 1997 Plan Option shall continue in effect in accordance with its terms, except that following the Effective Time the holder of the 1997 Plan Option shall, upon the exercise thereof in full and payment of the aggregate exercise price therefor, be entitled to receive, in respect of the shares of Company Common Stock subject to the 1997 Plan Option immediately prior to the Effective Time, an amount in cash (without interest and subject to applicable withholdings) equal to the Per Share Amount multiplied by the number of shares of Company Common Stock subject thereto immediately prior to the Effective Time. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall take such additional actions as are necessary under applicable Law and the applicable agreements and Company Incentive Plan to ensure that each outstanding Option shall, from and after the Effective Time, represent only the right to receive the Cash Payment contemplated by  _Section 3.3(a)_above or, upon exercise of the Option and payment of the exercise price therefor, the consideration subject to the Option contemplated by this _Section 3.3(c)_.   

 (d) As soon as practicable after the Effective Time, Parent shall file with the SEC a registration statement on Form S-8 with respect to all shares of Parent Stock which are subject to the Assumed Options.

The Company shall take such actions as are necessary under applicable Law and the Company ESPP to treat the applicable date referenced in the preceding sentence as the last day of the current Purchase Period (as such term is defined in the Company ESPP) and to suspend any new purchase periods under the Company ESPP. The Company shall promptly notify Parent of the number of shares of Company Common Stock hereafter acquired under the Company ESPP.   

 (f) Parent and the Company shall take all such steps as may be required to cause the dispositions of Company equity securities (including derivative securities) and acquisitions of Parent equity securities (including derivative securities) in connection with this _Section 3.3_ to be exempt under Rule 16b-3 promulgated under the Exchange Act.   

 (g) Parent shall, prior to the Effective Time, take all action necessary so that, at the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without the need of any further corporate action, Parent shall assume the Company Incentive Plan.

 3.4 _Exchange of Certificates Representing Company Common Stock _. (a) Prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall appoint a commercial bank or trust company, subject to the reasonable satisfaction of the Company, to act as exchange agent hereunder for the purpose of paying the Per Share Amount upon surrender of the Certificates in accordance with this  _Article 3_ (the " _Exchange Agent_ "). At or promptly following the Effective Time, Parent shall deposit or cause to be deposited with the Exchange Agent in trust for the benefit of the Companys stockholders the Per Share Amount to be delivered in exchange for all of the shares of Company Common Stock pursuant to this _Article 3_. Any cash deposited with the Exchange Agent shall be referred to as the " _Exchange Fund_." The Exchange Agent shall cause the Exchange Fund to be (i) held for the benefit of the holders of shares of Company Common Stock and (ii) promptly applied to making the payments provided for in _Section 3.2(a)_. Any income from investment of the cash in the Exchange Fund will be payable solely to Parent.   

 (b) As promptly as possible after the Effective Time, Parent shall instruct the Exchange Agent to mail to each holder of record of shares of Company Common Stock: (i) a letter of transmittal which shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to such Certificate(s) shall pass, only upon delivery of such Certificate(s) to the Exchange Agent and which letter shall be in such form and have such other provisions as are customary for letters of this nature and (ii) instructions for effecting the surrender of such Certificate(s) in exchange for the Per Share Amount (which shall provide that, at the election of the surrendering holder, such Certificate(s) may be surrendered, and payment therefor collected, by hand delivery). Upon surrender of such Certificate(s) to the Exchange Agent together with such letter of transmittal, duly executed and completed in accordance with the instructions thereto, and such other documents as may be reasonably required by the Exchange Agent, the holder of such Certificate(s) shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor the amount of cash, without interest, into which shares of Company Common Stock formerly represented by such Certificate(s) shall have been converted into the right to receive pursuant to _Section 3.2_, after giving effect to any required Tax (as defined in _Section 4.9_) withholdings, and the shares formerly represented by the Certificate(s) so surrendered shall forthwith be canceled. No interest will be paid or will accrue on the cash payable upon surrender of any Certificate(s). In the event of a transfer of ownership of Company Common Stock that is not registered in the transfer records of the Company, payment may be made with respect to such Company Common Stock to such a transferee if such Certificate(s) representing such shares of Company Common Stock is presented to the Exchange Agent, accompanied by all documents required to evidence and effect such transfer and to evidence that any applicable transfer or other Taxes have been paid. Until surrendered as contemplated by this _Section 3.4(b)_, each Certificate (other than Certificates representing Dissenting Common Stock (as defined in _Section 3.6_)) shall be deemed at any time after the Effective Time to represent only the right to receive upon such surrender the amount of cash, without interest, into which the shares of Company Common Stock theretofore represented by such Certificate(s) shall have been converted pursuant to this _Article 3_. Parent, Purchaser or the Exchange Agent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the Per Share Amount otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement to any holder of shares of Company Common Stock of the Company such amounts as Parent, Purchaser or the Exchange Agent are required to deduct and withhold under the Code, or any provision of state, local or foreign tax Law, with respect to the making of such payment. To the extent the amounts are so withheld by Parent, Purchaser or the Exchange Agent, such withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this     ##### 

    

Agreement as having been paid to the holder of shares of Company Common Stock
in respect of whom such deduction and withholding was made by Parent,
Purchaser or the Exchange Agent.  

 (c) All cash paid upon surrender of Certificates in accordance with the terms of this _Article 3_ shall be deemed to have been issued and paid in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to the shares of Company Common Stock theretofore represented by such Certificates. At or after the Effective Time, there shall be no transfers on the stock transfer books of the Company of the shares of Company Common Stock that were outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time. If, after the Effective Time, Certificates are presented to the Surviving Corporation, they shall be canceled and exchanged as provided in this _Article 3_.   

 (d) Any portion of the Per Share Amount made available to the Exchange Agent pursuant to _Section 3.4(a)_ (including the proceeds of any interest and other income received by the Exchange Agent in respect of all such funds) that remains undistributed to the former stockholders of the Company six (6) months after the Effective Time shall be delivered to Parent, upon demand. Any former stockholders of the Company who have not theretofore complied with this _Article 3_ shall thereafter look only to Parent for payment of any Per Share Amount, without any interest thereon, that may be payable in respect of each share of Company Common Stock such stockholder held as of the Effective Time as determined pursuant to this Agreement.   

 (e) None of Parent, the Company, the Surviving Corporation, the Exchange Agent or any other Person shall be liable to any former holder of shares of Company Common Stock for any amount properly delivered to a public official pursuant to applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar Laws.   

 (f) In the event any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the Person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if required by the Surviving Corporation, either the posting by such Person of a bond in such reasonable amount as the Surviving Corporation may direct as indemnity against any claim which may be made against it with respect to such Certificate or delivery of a writing by such Person to fully indemnify the Surviving Corporation and the Exchange Agent against any claim that may be made against them with respect to the certificates alleged to have been lost, stolen or destroyed, the Exchange Agent will issue in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate the Per Share Amount payable in respect thereof pursuant to this Agreement.   

 (g) Parent or Purchaser shall pay all of the Exchange Agents fees in connection with the exchange of the Per Share Amount for Certificates.   

 3.5 _Adjustment of Per Share Amount_. In the event that, subsequent to the date of this Agreement but prior to the Effective Time, the outstanding shares of Company Common Stock shall have been changed into a different number of shares or a different class as a result of a stock split, reverse stock split, stock dividend, subdivision, reclassification, split, combination, exchange, recapitalization or other similar transaction, the Per Share Amount shall be appropriately adjusted.      ##### 

    

 3.6 _Dissenting Company Stockholders_. Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to the contrary, shares of Company Common Stock that are issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time and which are held by holders of such shares of Company Common Stock who have properly exercised appraisal rights with respect thereto in accordance with Section 262 of the DGCL (the " _Dissenting Common Stock_ ") will not be exchangeable for the right to receive the Per Share Amount, and holders of such shares of Dissenting Common Stock will be entitled to receive payment of the appraised value of such shares of Company Common Stock in accordance with the provisions of such Section 262 unless and until such holders fail to perfect or effectively withdraw or lose their rights to appraisal and payment under the DGCL. If, after the Effective Time, any such holder fails to perfect or effectively withdraws or loses such right, such shares of Company Common Stock will thereupon be treated as if they had been converted into and have become exchangeable for, at the Effective Time, the right to receive the Per Share Amount, without any interest thereon. The Company shall give Parent: (i) prompt notice of any demands for payment received by the Company pursuant to Section 262 of the DGCL, withdrawals of such demands and any other instruments served pursuant to the DGCL and received by the Company and (ii) the right to participate in all negotiations and proceedings with respect to any such demand for appraisal under the DGCL. The Company shall not, except with the prior written consent of Parent, make any payment with respect to any demands for appraisal or offer to settle or settle any such demands.   

 3.7 _No Further Ownership Rights in Company Common Stock_. From and after the Effective Time, the holders of the shares of Company Common Stock which were outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall cease to have any rights with respect to such shares except as otherwise provided in this Agreement or by applicable Law. All cash paid upon the surrender of Certificates in accordance with the terms hereof shall be deemed to have been paid in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to the shares of Company Common Stock formerly represented by the Certificates.   

 3.8 _Closing of Company Transfer Books_. At the close of business on the day on which the Effective Time occurs, the stock transfer books of the Company shall be closed, and there shall be no further registration of transfers on the stock transfer books of the Surviving Corporation of the shares of Company Common Stock that were outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time. If, after the Effective Time, Certificates are presented to the Surviving Corporation or the Exchange Agent for transfer or any other reason, they shall be canceled and exchanged as provided in this _Article 3_.

The Company Disclosure Schedule lists each Company Employee Benefit Plan.   

 (b) Except as contemplated by this Agreement or as set forth in the Company Disclosure Schedule, neither the execution of, nor the consummation of the transactions contemplated in this Agreement will, either alone or upon the occurrence of subsequent events, result in or cause any payment (whether of severance pay or otherwise), acceleration, forgiveness of indebtedness, vesting, distribution, increase in benefits or obligation to fund benefits with respect to any director or employee or Company Employee Benefit Plan.   

 (c) The Company Employee Benefit Plans have been maintained in all material respects in accordance with their terms and with all provisions of ERISA and the Code and all other applicable federal and state Laws and regulations.

and each such plan has been determined by the IRS to be qualified under such
Section and its related trust has been determined to be exempt from taxation
under Section 501(a) of the Code (or has time remaining under applicable IRS
pronouncements to apply for and obtain such a determination letter) and, to
the knowledge of the Company, no event has occurred since the date of such
determination which would cause the loss of such qualified or exempt status.

anticipated claims (other than routine claims for benefits) by, on behalf of

thereto or pursuant to any Employment Agreement. Neither the Company nor any
ERISA Affiliate (as defined in _Section 9.7(f)_) currently sponsors,

or Title IV of ERISA. No "prohibited transaction," within the meaning of
Section 4975 of the Code or Section 406 of ERISA, has occurred with respect
to any Company Employee Benefit Plan. No liability under any Company Employee
Benefit Plan has been funded nor has any such obligation been satisfied with
the purchase of a contract from an insurance company as to which the Company
has received notice that such insurance company is insolvent or is in
rehabilitation or any similar proceeding. To the Companys knowledge, no
Company Employee Benefit Plan is under audit or investigation by, or is
the subject of a proceeding with respect to, the IRS, the Department of Labor
or the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation, and, to the knowledge of the
Company, no such audit, investigation or proceeding is threatened. With
respect to each Company Employee Benefit Plan which provides medical
benefits, short-term disability benefits or long-term disability benefits,
all claims incurred by the Company under such Company Employee Benefit Plan
are either insured pursuant to a contract of insurance whereby the insurance
company bears any risk of loss with respect to such claims or covered under a
contract with a health maintenance organization pursuant to which such health
maintenance organization bears the liability for such claims. Neither the
execution and delivery of this Agreement nor the consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby will (either alone or in conjunction with
any other event such as termination of employment) result in any payment or
benefit that will or may be made by the Company or any of its subsidiaries or
Affiliates that will be characterized as an "excess parachute payment,"
within the meaning of Section 280G of the Code. Neither the Company nor any
of its subsidiaries or ERISA Affiliates has any liability to provide any
post-retirement or post-termination life, health, medical or other welfare
benefits to any current or former employees or beneficiaries or dependents
thereof, except for health continuation coverage as required by Section 4980B
of the Code or Part 6 of Title I of ERISA and at no expense to the Company
and its subsidiaries. The Company may amend or terminate any Company Employee
Benefit Plan at any time without incurring liability thereunder other than in
respect of accrued obligations and medical or welfare claims incurred prior
to such amendment or termination.

Except as set forth in the Company Disclosure Schedule, (i) Foreign Plans intended to qualify as Tax registered or Tax favored plans under a foreign jurisdiction are the subject of a favorable determination or similar approval, to the extent available, of the applicable foreign Governmental Entities, (ii) nothing has occurred     ##### 

    

since the date of such approval that would cause the loss of such approval or
the imposition of any related liability, penalty or Tax under applicable
foreign Law, and (iii) the fair market value of the assets of each funded
Foreign Plan, the liability of each insurer for any Foreign Plan funded
through insurance or the book reserve established for any Foreign Plan,
together with any accrued contributions, is sufficient to procure or provide
for the accrued benefit obligations, as of the date hereof, with respect to
all current and former participants in such Foreign Plans according to
reasonable actuarial assumptions and valuations.  

 4.11 _Labor and Employment Matters_. (a) Neither the Company nor any of its subsidiaries is a party to, or bound by, any collective bargaining agreements or understandings with any labor unions or labor organizations.

 (b) There are no complaints, charges or claims against the Company or its subsidiaries pending or, to the knowledge of the Company, threatened to be brought or filed with any Governmental Entity based on, arising out of, in connection with, or otherwise relating to the employment or termination of employment of any individual by the Company or its subsidiaries that, if individually or collectively resolved against the Company or its subsidiaries, would have a Company Material Adverse Effect.   

 (c) Each of the Company and its subsidiaries is in compliance with all Laws regarding employment practices, terms and conditions of employment and wages, except for such noncompliance that, individually or in the aggregate, would not have a Company Material Adverse Effect.   

 (d) During the last five years there has been no "mass layoff" or "plant closing" as defined by the Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification Act of 1988 (the " _WARN Act_ ") in respect of the Company or its subsidiaries. Neither the Company nor any of its subsidiaries has been affected by any transactions or engaged in layoffs or employment terminations sufficient in number to trigger application of any state, local or foreign Law or regulation which is similar to the WARN Act.   

 4.12 _Brokers_. No broker, finder, investment banker or financial advisor, other than the Company Financial Advisor (the fees and expenses of which will be paid by the Company), is entitled to any brokerage, finders or other similar fee or commission in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement based upon any arrangement made by or on behalf of the Company.

individually or in the aggregate, would not have a Company Material Adverse
Effect. As of the date hereof, (a) no modification, revocation, suspension or
cancellation of any of the Company Permits is pending or, to the knowledge of
the Company, threatened, and (b) no Company Permit is subject to any
outstanding order, decree, judgment, stipulation or investigation that would
be likely to affect such Company Permit, except in the case of (a) or (b),

aspects of the Company Takeover Proposal) as well as any other factors deemed
relevant by the Board of Directors) than the proposal evidenced by this
Agreement (a " _Company Competitive Proposal_ "), (x) furnish information with
respect to the Company and its subsidiaries to the Person making this Company
Competitive Proposal (and its representatives) pursuant to a customary
confidentiality agreement (which confidentiality agreement contains terms
that are equivalent to, and in no respect less favorable to the Company than,
the terms of the Confidentiality Agreement, dated August 30, 2002, between
Parent and the Company (as it may be amended from time to time, the "
_Confidentiality Agreement_ ")), and (y) participate in discussions or
negotiations with the Person making this Company Competitive Proposal (and
its representatives) regarding this Company Competitive Proposal, provided
that (i) the Board of Directors determines in good faith, after consultation
with its outside legal counsel, that the failure to provide such information
or engage in such negotiation, would be inconsistent with the Board of
Directors fiduciary duties under applicable Law and (ii) a copy of all the
information provided to such Person is delivered simultaneously to Parent if
it has not previously been furnished or made available to Parent.  

 Promptly after the execution of this Agreement, the Company will, and will cause each of its subsidiaries and each of the Company Representatives to, (i) terminate all discussions or negotiations with all third parties regarding any Company Takeover Proposal and (ii) request the prompt return or destruction of all confidential information relating to the Company or any of its subsidiaries previously furnished to any such third parties.

than a confidentiality agreement referred to in _Section 6.1(a)_) unless, in
the case of clauses (i) and (ii) above, the Board of Directors determines in
good faith, based on those matters as it deems appropriate, after consulting
with outside legal counsel, that taking this action would be consistent with
its fiduciary duties under applicable Law. Notwithstanding anything in this
_Section 6.1_ to the contrary, at any time prior to acceptance of the
Company Shares pursuant to the Offer, the Board of Directors may, in response
to a Company Superior Proposal (as defined below) that was unsolicited and
that did not otherwise result from a breach of _Section 6.1(a)_, cause the
Company to terminate this Agreement pursuant to _Section 8.1(c)(iii)_
and concurrently enter into an Acquisition Agreement, subject to compliance
with the last sentence of the following paragraph.  

 The term " _Company Superior Proposal_ " means any written offer regarding a Company Takeover Proposal not solicited by or on behalf of the Company or any of its subsidiaries in violation of this _Section 6.1_ made by a third party that if consummated would result in the third party (or in the case of a direct merger between the third party and the Company or one of its subsidiaries, the stockholders of the third party) acquiring, directly or indirectly, at least 30% of the voting power of the shares of Company Common Stock or all or substantially all of the assets of the Company and its subsidiaries, taken as a whole, that the Board of Directors determines in its good faith judgment (after consultation with a financial advisor of nationally recognized reputation) (taking into account the Person making the offer, the consideration offered, the likelihood and timing of consummation (including the legal, financial and regulatory aspects of the offer) as well as any other factors deemed relevant by the Board of Directors) is more favorable to the stockholders of the Company than the transaction contemplated by this Agreement. Before accepting a Company Superior Proposal, the Company will provide Parent with at least two (2) business days (as defined in _Section 9.7(b)_) prior written notice (" _Superior Proposal Notice_ ") advising Parent that the Board of Directors has received a Company Superior Proposal which it intends to accept, specifying the terms and conditions of such Company Superior Proposal and identifying the Person making such Company Superior Proposal and for a period of not less than two (2) business days after Parents receipt from the Company of each Superior Proposal Notice, the Company shall, if requested by Parent, negotiate in good faith with Parent to revise this Agreement so that the Company Superior Proposal no longer is superior to the proposal contained in this Agreement.   

 (c) If the Board of Directors determines that any Company Takeover Proposal is a Company Superior Proposal, the Board of Directors authorizes the Company to enter into an Acquisition Agreement with regard to such proposal in lieu of the proposal contained in this Agreement, and this Agreement is terminated pursuant to _Section 8.1(c)(iii)_, then the Company shall pay Parent the Termination Fee (as defined in _Section 8.2(b))_ in accordance with the terms of _Section 8.2(b) _.   

 (d) Nothing contained in this _Section 6.1_ or elsewhere in this Agreement shall prohibit the Company from (i) taking and disclosing to its stockholders a position contemplated by Rules 14d-9 and 14e-2 or Item 1012(a) of Regulation M-A promulgated under the Exchange Act or (ii) making any disclosure to the Companys stockholders if, in the good faith judgment of the Board of Directors, after consultation with outside legal counsel, failure so to disclose would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under applicable Law.     ##### 

    

 6.2 _Interim Operations of the Company_. (a) Except as otherwise expressly contemplated by this Agreement, as set forth in the Company Disclosure Schedule or as consented to in writing by Parent, during the period from the date of this Agreement to the earliest to occur of the date of the termination of this Agreement and the Control Date, the Company shall, and shall cause its subsidiaries to, (i) conduct its operations according to its ordinary course of business consistent with past practice and in compliance in all material respects with all applicable Laws, (ii) use its reasonable best efforts to preserve intact its business organizations and goodwill, keep available the services of its officers, employees and consultants, and maintain satisfactory relationships with those Persons having business relationships with them, (iii) not take any action that would reasonably be expected to result in any of the conditions set forth in _Annex I_ hereto or the conditions set forth in  _Article 7_ hereof not being satisfied or could result in a material delay or material additional regulatory burdens to, or otherwise impede or prevent consummation of, the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.   

 (b) Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, and except as otherwise expressly contemplated by this Agreement, as set forth in the Company Disclosure Schedule or as consented to in writing by Parent, during the period from the date of this Agreement to the earliest to occur of the date of the termination of this Agreement and the Control Date, the Company shall not, and shall cause each of its subsidiaries not to:

 6.3 _Proxy Statement_. As promptly as practicable after the consummation of the Offer and if required by the Exchange Act or the DGCL, the Company shall prepare and file with the SEC, and shall use all reasonable efforts to have cleared by the SEC, and promptly thereafter shall mail to stockholders, the Proxy Statement. The Proxy Statement shall contain the     ##### 

    

recommendation of the Board of Directors that the Companys stockholders
approve this Agreement and the Merger. The Company will use its reasonable
best efforts to respond to any comments of the SEC or its staff. The Company
will notify Parent of the receipt of any comments from the SEC or its staff
and of any request by the SEC or its staff for amendments or supplements to
the Proxy Statement or for additional information and will supply Parent
promptly with copies of all correspondence between the Company or any of its
representatives, on the one hand, and the SEC, on the other hand. The Company
shall give Parent and its counsel the opportunity to review the Proxy
Statement prior to it being filed with the SEC and shall give Parent and its
counsel the opportunity to review all amendments and supplements to the Proxy
Statement and all responses to requests for additional information and
replies to comments prior to their being filed with, or sent to, the SEC.

after consultation with the other parties hereto, to respond promptly to all
such comments of, and requests by, the SEC. Parent will provide the Company
with the information concerning Parent and Purchaser required to be included
in the Proxy Statement. If, at any time prior to the Effective Time, the

statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made,
not misleading, the party that discovers that information shall promptly
notify the other party and an appropriate amendment or supplement describing
such information shall be promptly filed with the SEC and, to the extent
required by Law or regulation, disseminated to the stockholders of the
Company.  

 6.4 _Meeting of Stockholders of the Company_. Following the consummation of the Offer, the Company shall promptly take all action necessary in accordance with the DGCL and its certificate of incorporation and bylaws to convene the Special Meeting, if such meeting is required.

The Company shall use its best efforts to solicit from stockholders of the Company proxies in favor of the Merger and shall take all other action necessary or, in the reasonable opinion of Parent, advisable to secure any vote of stockholders required by the DGCL to effect the Merger. At the Special Meeting, Parent shall cause all of the Company Common Stock held by Parent and its subsidiaries to be voted in favor of the Merger. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if Purchaser or any other subsidiary of Parent shall acquire at least 90% of the outstanding Company Shares, and provided that the conditions set forth in _Article 7_ shall have been satisfied or waived, the Company shall, at the request of Parent, take all necessary and appropriate action to cause the Merger to become effective as soon as practicable after such acquisition, without the approval of the stockholders of the Company, in accordance with Section 253 of the DGCL.

Agreement;  _provided_ , _however_ , that any action taken by the Company or
the Board of Directors expressly permitted under  _Section 6.1_ hereof shall
be deemed not to constitute a breach by the Company of this _Section 6.5_;
and  _provided_ , _further_ , that Parent agrees to guarantee the
obligations of the Company pursuant to the agreements identified in Section
4.5 of the Company Disclosure Schedule if required in order to obtain consent
to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement;  _provided_ , _further_ ,

(tangible or intangible) or any material business interests in connection
with or as a condition to receiving the consent or approval of any
Governmental Entity (including, without limitation, under the HSR Act). If,
at any time after the Effective Time, any further action is necessary or
desirable to carry out the purpose of this Agreement, the proper officers and

 (c) The parties acknowledge that Parent and the Company have previously executed the Confidentiality Agreement with respect to the transactions contemplated herein, which Confidentiality Agreement shall continue in full force and effect in accordance with its terms.

of confidentiality contained herein and therein, as they relate to the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, shall not apply to the
tax structure or tax treatment of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, and each party hereto (and any employee, representative or agent

order to comply with applicable securities Laws.

 6.9 _Insurance; Indemnity_. (a) Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to maintain in effect for not less than six years after the Effective Time, the Companys and its subsidiaries current directors and officers insurance policies (or policies of at least the same coverage containing terms and conditions no less advantageous to the current and all former directors and officers of the Company and its subsidiaries) with respect to acts or failures to act prior to the Effective Time, including acts relating to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement; _provided_ , _however_ , that Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall not be required to maintain or obtain policies providing such coverage except to the extent such coverage can be provided at an aggregate premium of no greater than $4,000,000 (the " _Cap_ "); and  _provided_ , _further_ , that if equivalent coverage cannot be obtained, or can be obtained only by paying an aggregate premium in excess of the Cap, Parent or the Surviving Corporation shall only be required to obtain as much coverage as can be obtained by paying an aggregate premium equal to the Cap.   

 (b) For six years after the Effective Time, Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall indemnify and hold harmless to the same extent such Persons are indemnified on the date of this Agreement under the certificate of incorporation and bylaws of the Company and the equivalent organization documents of its subsidiaries to the fullest extent permitted under applicable Law and whether asserted or claimed prior to, at or after the Effective Time, each Person who is, or has been at any time prior to the date hereof or who becomes prior to the Effective Time, an officer or director of the Company or any of its subsidiaries (each, an " _Indemnified Party_ " and collectively, the " _Indemnified Parties_ "), against any costs or expenses (including reasonable attorneys fees), judgments, fines, losses, claims, damages, liabilities or, subject to the last sentence of this paragraph, amounts paid in settlement, arising in connection with any claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation (an " _Action_ ") arising out of, relating to or in connection with (i) any acts or omissions occurring or alleged to occur prior to the Effective Time (including, without limitation, acts or omissions in connection with such Persons serving as an officer or director or other fiduciary in any Person if such service was at the request or for the benefit of the Company) or (ii) the adoption and approval of this Agreement, the Merger or the     ##### 

    

other transactions contemplated by this Agreement or arising out of, relating
to or in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. In
the event of any such Action, the Surviving Corporation shall control the
defense of such Action with counsel selected by the Surviving Corporation,
which counsel shall be reasonably acceptable to the Indemnified Party;
_provided_ ,  _however_ , that the Indemnified Party shall be permitted
to participate in the defense of such Action through counsel selected by
the Indemnified Party, which counsel shall be reasonably acceptable to
the Surviving Corporation, at the Indemnified Partys expense.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, if there is any conflict between the Surviving
Corporation and any Indemnified Parties or there are additional defenses
available to any Indemnified Parties, the Indemnified Parties shall be
permitted to participate in the defense of such Action with counsel selected
by the Indemnified Parties, which counsel shall be reasonably acceptable to
the Surviving Corporation, and Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation
to pay the reasonable fees and expenses of such counsel, as accrued and in
advance of the final disposition of such Action to the fullest extent
permitted by applicable Law;  _provided_ , _however_ , that the
Surviving Corporation shall not be obligated to pay the reasonable fees and
expenses of more than one counsel for all Indemnified Parties in any single
Action except to the extent that, in the opinion of counsel for the
Indemnified Parties, two or more of such Indemnified Parties have conflicting
interests in the outcome of such Action. Parent and Purchaser acknowledge
that the members of the Board of Directors shall be entitled to select their
own counsel pursuant to the preceding sentence with respect to any litigation
related to the transactions contemplated hereby; _provided_ , _however_
, that such counsel must be reasonably acceptable to Parent. Any
Indemnified Party wishing to claim indemnification under this _Section
6.9(b)_, upon learning of any such claim, action, suit, proceeding
or investigation eligible for indemnification under this _Section 6.9(b)_,
shall notify the Surviving Corporation, but failure to notify the Surviving
Corporation shall not relieve it from any liability which it may have under
this _Section 6.9(b)_, except to the extent that such failure results in the
forfeiture of substantive rights or defenses. The Surviving Corporation shall
not be liable for any settlement effected without its written consent, which
consent shall not unreasonably be withheld.  

 (c) Following the Merger, Parent will cause the Surviving Corporation to, keep in effect for six years after the Effective Time all provisions in the Surviving Corporations certificate of incorporation and bylaws that provide for exculpation of director and officer liability and indemnification (and advancement of expenses related thereto) of the past and present officers and directors of the Company at least to the extent they are presently indemnified by the Company and such provisions shall not be amended except as either required by applicable Law or to make changes permitted by Law that would not adversely effect the rights of past or present officers and directors to indemnification or advancement of expenses.   

 (d) The provisions of this _Section 6.9_ are in addition to the rights that an Indemnified Party may have under the certificate of incorporation, bylaws or agreements of or with the Company or any of its subsidiaries or under applicable Law. Parent agrees to pay all costs and expenses (including reasonable fees and expenses of counsel) that may be incurred by any Indemnified Party in successfully enforcing the indemnity or other obligations under this _Section 6.9_.   

 (e) If Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any of their successors or assigns (i) shall consolidate with or merge into any other Person and shall not be the continuing     ##### 

    

or surviving Person of such consolidation or merger or (ii) shall transfer or
convey all or substantially all of its properties and assets to any Person,
then and in each such case, Parent shall cause proper provisions to be made
so that the successors and assigns of Parent or the Surviving Corporation, as
the case may be, shall assume all of the obligations set forth in this
_Section 6.9_.  

 (f) The provisions of this _Section 6.9_ shall survive the Merger and are intended to be for the benefit of, and shall be enforceable by, each of the Indemnified Parties, their heirs and their representatives.

Any workforce reductions carried out following the Effective Time by Parent or the Company and their subsidiaries shall be done in accordance with all applicable collective bargaining agreements, and all Laws governing the employment relationship and termination thereof, including, without limitation, the WARN Act and regulations promulgated thereunder, and any comparable state or local Law.

Without limiting the foregoing, with respect to any benefit plan existing or established to replace any Company Employee Benefit Plan (other than Company Stock Plans), each participant in any such Company Employee Benefit Plan shall receive credit for his or her period of employment with the Company and its subsidiaries prior to the Effective Time for purposes of eligibility to participate and vesting (but not benefit accrual) under the corresponding replacement plan;  _provided_ , _however_ , that such crediting of service shall not operate to duplicate any benefit to any such participant or the funding for any such benefit or cause any such benefit plan to fail to comply with the applicable provisions of the Code or ERISA; and  _provided_ , _further_ , _however_ , that if Parent or any Affiliate adopts any new Parent Plan, credit for a Continuing Employees period of employment with the Company or its subsidiaries prior to the Effective Time will be taken into account for purposes of eligibility to participate and vesting (but not benefit accrual) under such new Parent Plan to the same extent     ##### 

    

such period of employment would have been taken into account had it been with
Parent or its Affiliates.  

 (b) With respect to any group health benefit plan existing or established to replace any Company Employee Benefit Plan which is a group health benefit plan in which Continuing Employees may be eligible to participate after the Effective Time, other than limitations, exclusions or waiting periods that are already in effect with respect to such Continuing Employees and that have not been satisfied as of the Effective Time, such replacement plans shall waive all limitations to pre-existing conditions, exclusions and waiting periods with respect to participation and coverage requirements and provide each Continuing Employee with credit for other co-payments and deductibles paid prior to the Effective Time in satisfying any applicable deductible or out-of-pocket requirements applicable to the same calendar year under any group health plans that such Continuing Employees are eligible to participate in after the Effective Time.

The Company and Parent shall use their best efforts to file as soon as practicable all notifications or filings required to be made or filed with the antitrust authorities of foreign jurisdictions in connection with the Merger and the transactions contemplated hereby, and to respond as promptly as practicable to any inquiries received from such antitrust authorities for additional information or documentation.   

 6.14 _Certain Notices_. From and after the date of this Agreement until the Effective Time, each party hereto shall promptly notify the other party hereto of (i) the occurrence, or non-occurrence of any event which would reasonably be expected to cause any condition to the obligations of any party to effect the Offer or the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement not to be satisfied, or (ii) the failure of the Company or Parent, as the case may be, to comply with or satisfy any covenant, condition or agreement to be complied with or satisfied by it pursuant to this Agreement which would reasonably be expected to result in any condition to the obligations of any party to effect the Offer or the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement not to be satisfied;  _provided_ , _however_ , that the delivery of any notice pursuant to this _Section 6.14_ shall not limit or otherwise affect the remedies available hereunder to the party receiving such notice.     ##### 

    

 6.15 _Environmental Reports_.   

 (a) Within 30 days of the date of this Agreement, the Company shall (i) cause an environmental consultant selected by the Company and reasonably acceptable to Parent (the " _Environmental Consultant_ ") to conduct Phase I environmental assessments in accordance with ASTM Standard E1527-00 (Standard Practice for Environmental Site Assessments: Phase I Environmental Site Assessment Process) with respect to each of the properties identified in Section 6.15 of the Company Disclosure Schedule (the " _Phase I Reports_ "), which Phase I Reports shall contain a review of ongoing remediation issues (but shall in no event include soil or groundwater sampling) and (ii) deliver to Parent the Phase I Reports. All costs relating to the preparation of the Phase I Reports shall be the sole responsibility of Parent, and Parent shall promptly reimburse the Company for all such costs.   

 (b) It is agreed by the parties that the Phase I Reports shall be deemed added to Section 4.14 of the Company Disclosure Schedule as of the Closing Date and shall not constitute a failure of the representations in Section 4.14 of the Company Disclosure Schedule to be true and correct as of the Closing Date, except to the extent that any one or more conditions, facts or circumstances disclosed in such Phase I Reports and not disclosed in the Company Disclosure Schedule delivered on the date of this Agreement has had or would reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Company Material Adverse Effect.

and Expenses payable pursuant to this _Section 8.2(b)_ shall be paid
concurrent with such termination or immediately upon the satisfaction of the
conditions to such payment obligation set forth in this _Section
8.2(b)_.  

 8.3 _Amendment_. This Agreement may be amended by the parties at any time before or after receipt of Company Stockholder Approval;  _provided_ , _however_ , that after receipt of the Company Stockholder Approval, there shall be made no amendment that by Law requires further approval by the stockholders of the Company without which decreases or changes the form of the Per Share Amount or which adversely affects the rights of, or the income tax consequences to, the Companys stockholders (other than Parent and its Affiliates) hereunder without the approval of such stockholders. This Agreement may not be amended except by an instrument in writing signed on behalf of all of the parties.   

 8.4 _Extension; Waiver_. Subject to _Section 6.9_ , at any time prior to the Effective Time, any party hereto, by action taken by its board of directors, may, to the extent legally allowed, (a) extend the _time_ for the performance of any of the obligations or other acts of the other parties hereto, (b) waive any inaccuracies in the representations and warranties made to such party contained herein or in any document delivered pursuant hereto and (c) subject to the proviso of _Section 8.3_, waive compliance with any of the agreements or conditions for the benefit of such party contained herein; _provided_ , _however _ , that, if the Company seeks to make such extension or waiver as provided in (a), (b) or (c) above, it must first obtain the approval of its Board of Directors. Any agreement on the part of a party hereto to any such extension or waiver shall be valid only if set forth in an instrument in writing signed on behalf of such party. The failure or delay by any party to this Agreement to assert any of its rights under this Agreement or otherwise shall not constitute a waiver of such rights nor shall any single or partial exercise by any party to this Agreement of any of its rights under this Agreement preclude any other or further exercise of such rights or any other rights under this Agreement.
