Offer, Purchaser may, in its sole discretion, provide a &#147;subsequent offering
period&#148; of not more than 20 business days in accordance with Rule&nbsp;14d-11 under

respect to the Offer, a Tender Offer Solicitation/Recommendation Statement on
Schedule&nbsp;14D-9 (together with any amendments or supplements thereto, the

corrections of such information and cooperate with the Company with
respect to correcting such information) and to supplement the information
contained in the Schedule&nbsp;14D-9 to include any information that shall become

Purchaser of any Company Shares pursuant to the Offer (the date thereof being
referred to as the &#147;<U>Control Date</U>&#148;), and from time to time
thereafter as Company Shares are acquired by Purchaser, Purchaser shall be
entitled to designate such number of directors, rounded up to the next whole
number, on the Board of Directors as will give Purchaser, subject to compliance
with Section&nbsp;14(f) of the Exchange Act and Rule&nbsp;14f-1 promulgated thereunder,
representation on the Board of Directors equal to at least that number of
directors which equals the product of the total number of directors on the
Board of Directors (giving effect to the directors appointed or elected
pursuant to this sentence and including current directors serving as officers
of the Company) multiplied by the percentage that the aggregate number of
Company Shares beneficially owned by Purchaser or any Affiliate of Purchaser
(including for purposes of this <U>Section&nbsp;1.3</U> such Company
Shares as are accepted for payment pursuant to the Offer, but excluding Company
Shares held by the Company or any of its subsidiaries) bears to the number of
Company Shares outstanding. At each such time, the Company will also cause
each committee of the Board of Directors, if requested by Purchaser, the board
of directors of each of the subsidiaries and if requested by Purchaser, each
committee of such board of directors of each of the subsidiaries to include
Persons designated by Purchaser constituting the same percentage of each such
committee or board as Purchaser&#146;s designees constitute on the Board of
Directors. The Company shall, upon request by Purchaser, promptly increase the
size of the Board of Directors or exercise its best efforts to secure the
resignations of such number of directors as is necessary to enable Purchaser&#146;s
designees to be elected to the Board of Directors in accordance with the terms
of this <U>Section&nbsp;1.3</U> and shall cause Purchaser&#146;s designees
to be so elected; provided, however, that, in the event that Purchaser&#146;s
designees are appointed or elected to the Board of Directors, until the
Effective Time (as defined in <U>Section&nbsp;2.3</U> hereof) the Board
of Directors shall have at least three directors who are
directors on the date hereof and who are neither officers of the Company
nor designees, stockholders, Affiliates or associates (within the meaning of
the Federal securities laws) of Parent (one or more of such directors, the

Independent Directors remain, the other directors shall designate one Person to
fill one of the vacancies who shall be neither an officer of the Company nor a
designee, stockholder, Affiliate or associate of Parent, and such Person shall
be deemed to be an Independent Director for purposes of this Agreement.
Subject to applicable law, the Company shall promptly take all action necessary
pursuant to Section&nbsp;14(f) of the Exchange Act and Rule&nbsp;14f-1 promulgated
thereunder in order to fulfill its obligations under this <U>Section&nbsp;1.3

promptly after the commencement of the Offer (or an amendment thereof or an
information statement pursuant to Rule&nbsp;14f-1 if Purchaser has not theretofore
designated directors) such information with respect to the Company and its
officers and directors as is required under Section&nbsp;14(f) and Rule&nbsp;14f-1 in
order to fulfill its obligations under this <U>Section&nbsp;1.3</U>.
Purchaser will supply the Company any information with respect to itself and

option (the &#147;<U>Top-Up Option</U>&#148;), such option to be exercisable
only after Purchaser has purchased and paid for Company Shares constituting 88%
of the then outstanding Company Shares, to purchase, at a price per share equal
to the Per Share Amount, a number of shares of Company Common Stock (the
&#147;<U>Top-Up Option Shares</U>&#148;) that, when added to the number of
shares of Company Common Stock owned by Parent or Purchaser or any wholly-owned
subsidiary of Parent or Purchaser at the time of exercise of the Top-Up Option,
constitutes one share of Company Common Stock more than 90% of the number of
shares of Company Common Stock that will be outstanding immediately after the
issuance of the Top-Up Option Shares; <U>provided</U>,
<U>however</U>, that in no event shall the Top-Up Option be
exercisable for more than 1,682,784 shares of Company Common Stock. The Top-Up
Option may be exercised by Parent or Purchaser, in whole or in part, at any one
time on or after the expiration date of the Offer and on or prior to the tenth
business day after the later of the expiration date of the Offer or the
expiration of any subsequent offering period; provided, however, that the
obligation of the Company to deliver Top-Up Option Shares upon the exercise of
the Top-Up Option is subject to the condition that no provision of any
applicable Law and no judgment, injunction, order or decree shall prohibit the
exercise of the Top-Up Option or the delivery of the Top-Up Option Shares in
respect of such exercise. The parties shall cooperate to ensure that the
issuance of the Top-Up Option Shares is accomplished consistent with all
applicable legal requirements of all Governmental Entities, including
compliance with an applicable exemption from registration of the Top-Up Option Shares under
the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the &#147;<U>Securities Act</U>&#148;).

Parent shall so notify the Company and shall set forth in such notice the
number of shares of Company Common Stock that are expected to be owned by
Parent, Purchaser or any wholly-owned subsidiary of Parent or Purchaser
immediately preceding the purchase of the Top-Up Option Shares and a place and
time for the closing of the purchase of the Top-Up Option Shares. The Company
shall, as soon as practicable following receipt of such notice, notify Parent
and Purchaser of the number of shares of Company Common Stock then outstanding
and the number of Top-Up Option Shares. At the closing of the purchase of the
Top-Up Option Shares, Parent or Purchaser, as the case may be, shall pay the
Company the aggregate price required to be paid for the Top-Up Option Shares,
and the Company shall cause to be issued to Parent or Purchaser a certificate
representing the Top-Up Option Shares.

Board of Directors that the Company&#146;s stockholders approve this Agreement and
the Merger. The Company will use its reasonable best efforts to respond to any
comments of the SEC or its staff. The Company will notify Parent of the
receipt of any comments from the SEC or its staff and of any request by the SEC

with the SEC and shall give Parent and its counsel the opportunity to review
all amendments and supplements to the Proxy Statement and all responses to
requests for additional information and replies to comments prior to their

Purchaser required to be included in the Proxy Statement. If, at any time
prior to the Effective Time, the Company or Parent discovers any information
relating to such party, or any of their respective Affiliates, officer or

necessary in accordance with the DGCL and its certificate of incorporation and
bylaws to convene the Special Meeting, if such meeting is required. The
stockholder vote required for approval of the Merger will be no greater than

At the Special Meeting, Parent shall cause all of the Company Common Stock held

Notwithstanding the foregoing, if Purchaser or any other subsidiary of Parent
shall acquire at least 90% of the outstanding Company Shares, and provided that
