iii  5  AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER   This Agreement and Plan of Merger
(this "AGREEMENT") dated as of January 24, 2001, by and between Bellwether
Exploration Company, a Delaware corporation ("BELLWETHER"), and Bargo Energy
Company, a Texas corporation ("BARGO").   WHEREAS, the respective Boards of
Directors of Bellwether and Bargo deem it advisable and in the best interests
of their respective stockholders that Bargo merge with and into Bellwether
(the "MERGER") upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth herein,
and such Boards of Directors have approved the Merger; and   WHEREAS,
concurrently with the execution and delivery of this Agreement, (i) with the

agreements with each of BancAmerica Capital Investors SBIC I, L.P., Thomas D.
Barrow, James E. Sowell, Kayne Anderson Energy, L.P., Tim J. Goff, EnCap
Energy Capital Fund III, L.P., SGC Partners II, LLC, EOS Partners SBIC, L.P.,

with each of J.P. Bryan, Douglas G. Manner, Judy Ley Allen, A.K. McLanahan,
Vincent Buckley, Townes G. Pessler, and Cliff M. West, under which such
parties have among other things agreed to support the Merger upon the
terms and conditions set forth therein (collectively, the "VOTING
AGREEMENTS"); and   WHEREAS, for federal income tax purposes, it is intended
that the Merger will qualify as a reorganization under the provisions of
Section 368(a) of the United States Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended
(the "CODE");   NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the premises and
the representations, warranties and agreements contained herein, the parties
hereto agree as follows:   ARTICLE I   THE MERGER   1.1 The Merger.
Upon the terms and subject to the conditions hereof, at the Effective Time
(as defined in Section 1.2) Bargo shall merge with and into Bellwether and
the separate corporate existence of Bargo shall thereupon cease and
Bellwether shall be the surviving corporation in the Merger
(sometimes referred to herein as the "SURVIVING CORPORATION"). The Merger
shall have the effects set forth in Article 5.06 of the Texas Business
Corporation Act (the "TBCA") and Section 259 of the Delaware General
Corporation Law (the "DGCL"), including the Surviving Corporation\'s
succession to and assumption of all rights and obligations of Bargo.   1.2
Effective Time of the Merger. The Merger shall become effective (the
"EFFECTIVE TIME") upon the latest of (i) the filing of properly
executed Articles of Merger relating to the Merger with the Secretary of
State of Texas in accordance with the TBCA, and the issuance by the Secretary
of State of Texas of a certificate of merger with respect thereto, (ii) the
filing of a properly executed Certificate of Merger relating to the Merger
with the Secretary of State of     6  Delaware in accordance with the
DGCL, and the issuance by the Secretary of State of Delaware of a certificate
of merger with respect thereto, and (iii) at such later time as the parties
shall agree and set forth in such Articles of Merger and Certificate of
Merger. The filing of the Articles of Merger and Certificate of Merger
referred to above shall be made as soon as practicable on the Closing Date
set forth in Section 3.6.   1.3 Tax Treatment. It is intended that the
Merger shall constitute a reorganization under Section 368(a) of the
Code.   1.4 Accounting Treatment. It is intended that the Merger shall
be accounted for as a purchase transaction for financial accounting
purposes.   ARTICLE II   THE SURVIVING CORPORATION   2.1 Articles of
Incorporation. The Certificate of Incorporation of Bellwether in effect
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be the Certificate of
Incorporation of the Surviving Corporation at and after the Effective Time
until thereafter amended in accordance with the terms thereof and the DGCL,
except that Article I of the Surviving Corporation\'s Certificate
of Incorporation shall be amended to change the Surviving Corporation\'s name
to a name that is mutually acceptable to each of Bellwether and Bargo, which
name shall be chosen prior to the mailing of the
Proxy/Information Statement/Prospectus (as defined).   2.2 Bylaws. The
bylaws of Bellwether as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time
shall be the bylaws of the Surviving Corporation at and after the Effective
Time, and thereafter may be amended in accordance with their terms and as
provided by the Certificate of Incorporation of the Surviving Corporation and
the DGCL.   2.3 Directors and Officers. At and after the Effective Time,
the directors and officers of the Surviving Corporation shall be as set forth
in Section 7.12, until their respective successors have been duly elected
or appointed and qualified or until their earlier death, resignation or
removal in accordance with the Surviving Corporation\'s Certificate of
Incorporation and bylaws.   ARTICLE III   CONVERSION OF SHARES   3.1
Conversion of Capital Stock. As of the Effective Time, by virtue of the
Merger and without any action on the part of the holders of any capital stock
described below:   (a) All shares of Common Stock of Bargo, par value $.01
("BARGO COMMON STOCK"), that are held in Bargo\'s treasury will be canceled
and no cash, Bellwether capital stock or other consideration shall be
delivered in exchange therefor.   (b) Conversion of Bargo Common
Stock.     2  7   (i) Subject to Sections 3.4 and 3.5, each share of
Bargo  Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the 
Effective Time (other than shares of Bargo Common Stock treated in 
accordance with Section 3.1(a)) will be converted into (x) the Cash  Amount
(the "CASH CONSIDERATION") and (y) the right to receive the  number of shares
of Bellwether Common Stock, par value $.01 per  share ("BELLWETHER COMMON
STOCK") equal to the Exchange Ratio (the  "STOCK CONSIDERATION" and, together
with the Cash Consideration,  the "COMMON CONVERSION CONSIDERATION"). All
such shares of Bargo  Common Stock, when so converted, will no longer be
outstanding and  will automatically be retired and will cease to be
outstanding, and  the holder of a certificate ("COMMON STOCK CERTIFICATE")
that,  immediately prior to the Effective Time, represented outstanding 
shares of Bargo Common Stock will cease to have any rights with  respect
thereto, except the right to receive, upon the surrender of  such Common
Stock Certificate: (A) the applicable Common Conversion  Consideration, (B)
certain dividends and other distributions under  Section 3.1(e), and (C) cash
in lieu of fractional shares of  Bellwether Common Stock under Section 3.4,
in each case without  interest (collectively, the "COMMON STOCK MERGER
CONSIDERATION").  Notwithstanding the foregoing, if between the date of
this  Agreement and the Effective Time the outstanding shares of  Bellwether
Common Stock or Bargo Common Stock shall have been  changed into a different
number of shares or a different class,  because of any stock dividend,
subdivision, reclassification,  recapitalization, split, combination or
exchange of shares, the  Exchange Ratio and, with respect to such changes in
the outstanding  shares of Bargo Common Stock, the Cash Amount, shall be 
correspondingly adjusted to reflect such stock dividend,  subdivision,
reclassification, recapitalization, split, combination  or exchange of
shares.   (ii) For this Agreement the following terms will have the 
indicated meanings:   "ASSUMED PRICE" means the quotient of (i) the sum of
(A)  $56,412,896, (B) the aggregate exercise price of all of the  Bargo
Convertible Securities (as defined) issued and  outstanding on the date
hereof, and (C) $80,000,000 (provided  that if the Bellwether Market Price is
(x) greater than $9.00,  then clause (C) shall be equal to the product of
8,888,889  times the Bellwether Market Price or (y) less than $7.00, then 
clause (C) shall be equal to the product of 11,428,570 times  the Bellwether
Market Price) divided by (ii) the Fully Diluted  Bargo Equity immediately
prior to the acquisition of the Bargo  Convertible Securities under Section
3.3.   "BARGO CONVERTIBLE SECURITY CASH-OUT AMOUNT" means if the 
Bellwether Market Price is (i) less than or equal to $9.00,  then 70% of the
Bargo Convertible Security Value Amount, and  (ii) greater than $9.00, then
70% of what the Bargo  Convertible Security Value Amount would be if the
Bellwether  Market Price were $9.00. The "Bargo Convertible Security  Cash-
Out Amount" may be calculated for any holder of Bargo  Convertible Securities
or any grant of Bargo      3  8   Convertible Securities by using the
preceding formula except  for using the Bargo Security Value Amount
attributable to that  holder or grant instead of for all the Bargo
Convertible  Securities.   "BARGO CONVERTIBLE SECURITY VALUE AMOUNT" means
the  result of (i) the product of (A) the Assumed Price times (B)  the
number of Bargo Convertible Securities outstanding  immediately prior to the
acquisition of Bargo Convertible  Securities by Bargo under Section 3.3 minus
(ii) the aggregate  exercise price of all of the Bargo Convertible
Securities  outstanding immediately prior to the acquisition of Bargo 
Convertible Securities by Bargo under Section 3.3. The "Bargo  Convertible
Security Value Amount" may be calculated for any  holder of Bargo Convertible
Securities or any grant of Bargo  Convertible Securities by using the
preceding formula except  for replacing clauses (B) (and (ii)) with the
number of (the  aggregate exercise price of) the Bargo Convertible
Securities  for which such Bargo Convertible Security Value Amount is to  be
calculated.   "BELLWETHER MARKET PRICE" means the average of the  closing
prices on the Nasdaq National Market System of a share  of Bellwether Common
Stock over 20 consecutive trading days  ending on the third trading day
before the Closing Date.   "CASH AMOUNT" means the quotient of (i) the
result of (A)  the sum of (w) $56,412,896 plus (x) the aggregate proceeds 
Bargo has received prior to the Effective Time as the result  of the exercise
of any Bargo Convertible Securities between  the date hereof and the
Effective Time, minus (B) the Bargo  Convertible Security Cash-Out Amount,
divided by (ii) the  number of shares of Bargo Common Stock (other than
treasury  shares) outstanding at the Effective Time.   "EXCHANGE RATIO"
means the quotient of (i) the result of  (x) $80,000,000 minus (y) the
product of (I) number of  Reserved Bellwether Shares times (II) the
Bellwether Market  Price divided by (ii) the product of (A) the Bellwether
Market  Price times (B) the number of shares of Bargo Common Stock  (other
than treasury shares) outstanding at the Effective  Time. For this
definition, if the Bellwether Market Price is  greater than $9.00, the
Bellwether Market Price will be deemed  to be $9.00, and if the Bellwether
Market Price is less than  $7.00, the Bellwether Market Price will be deemed
to be $7.00   "FULLY DILUTED BARGO EQUITY" means the sum (without 
duplication) of the number of shares of Bargo Common Stock:  (a) outstanding
as of the Effective Time (other than treasury  shares); (b) issuable upon the
exercise of the Bargo  Convertible Securities outstanding      4  9  
immediately prior to the acquisition of Bargo Convertible  Securities by
Target under Section 3.3 (regardless of whether  such options or warrants are
exercisable); and (c) for which  all of Bargo\'s other derivative securities
are exercisable for  or convertible into, directly or indirectly, as of the 
Effective Time.   "RESERVED BELLWETHER SHARES" means the number of shares 
of Bellwether Common Stock determined by determining the  quotient of (i) the
result of (A) the Bargo Convertible  Security Value Amount minus (B) the
Bargo Convertible Security  Cash-Out Amount, divided by (ii) the Bellwether
Market Price  (rounded down to the nearest number of whole shares). The 
"Reserved Bellwether Shares" may be calculated for any holder  of Bargo
Convertible Securities or any grant of Bargo  Convertible Securities by using
the preceding formula except  replacing clause (B) with the Bargo Convertible
Security Value  Amount for the number of Bargo Convertible Securities for 
which such Bargo Convertible Security Value Amount is to be  calculated.  
(c) Subject to Section 3.5, each share of Cumulative Redeemable Preferred
Stock, Series B, par value $.01 of Bargo (the "BARGO B PREFERRED STOCK")
issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time will
be converted into the amount of cash that would be required to redeem such
share pursuant to the statement of resolution with respect thereto (the
"PREFERRED CONVERSION CONSIDERATION"). All such shares of Bargo B Preferred
Stock, when so converted, will no longer be outstanding and will
automatically be cancelled and retired and will cease to exist, and the
holder of a certificate ("PREFERRED STOCK CERTIFICATE" and, together with the
Common Stock Certificates, the "STOCK CERTIFICATES") that, immediately prior
to the Effective Time, represented outstanding shares of Bargo B Preferred
Stock will cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except the right to
receive, upon the surrender of such Preferred Stock Certificate, the
Preferred Conversion Consideration without interest (collectively, the
"PREFERRED STOCK MERGER CONSIDERATION" and, together with the Common Stock
Merger Consideration, the "MERGER CONSIDERATION").   (d) Each share of
Bellwether Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time shall not be affected by the Merger.   (e) No dividends or
other distributions declared or made after the Effective Time with a record
date after the Effective Time shall be paid to the holder of any un-
surrendered Common Stock Certificate with respect to the applicable Common
Stock Merger Consideration represented thereby until the holder of record of
such Common Stock Certificate shall surrender such Common Stock Certificate
in accordance with Section 3.2. Subject to the effect of applicable laws
(including escheat and abandoned property laws), following surrender of any
such Common Stock Certificate there shall be paid to the record holder of the
certificate or certificates representing the Common Stock
Merger Consideration issued in exchange therefor, without interest, (i) the
amount of dividends or other distributions with a record date after the
Effective Time theretofore paid with respect to Common Stock Merger
Consideration, and (ii) if the payment date for any dividend or distribution
payable with respect to Common Stock Merger Consideration has not occurred
prior to the surrender of such Common Stock      5  10  Certificate,
at the appropriate payment date therefor, the amount of dividends or other
distributions with a record date after the Effective Time but prior to the
surrender of such Common Stock Certificate and a payment date subsequent
to the surrender of such Common Stock Certificate.   (f) All Merger
Consideration issued upon the surrender of Stock Certificates in accordance
with the terms hereof shall be deemed to have been issued in full
satisfaction of all rights pertaining to such Stock Certificates and the
Bargo Common Stock or Bargo B Preferred Stock formerly represented thereby,
and from and after the Effective Time there shall be no further registration
of transfers effected on the stock transfer books of the
Surviving Corporation of shares of Bargo Common Stock or Bargo B Preferred
Stock which were outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time. If,
after the Effective Time, Stock Certificates are presented to the Surviving
Corporation for any reason, they shall be canceled and exchanged as provided
in this Article III.   3.2 Surrender and Payment.   (a) Bellwether shall
authorize one or more transfer agent(s) reasonably acceptable to Bargo to act
as Exchange Agent hereunder (the "EXCHANGE AGENT") with respect to the
Merger. At or prior to the Effective Time, Bellwether shall deposit with the
Exchange Agent for the benefit of the holders of Bargo Common Stock and Bargo
B Preferred Stock, for exchange in accordance with this Section 3.2 through
the Exchange Agent, Bellwether Common Stock and cash (collectively, the
"EXCHANGE FUND"). The Exchange Agent shall, pursuant to irrevocable
instructions, deliver the applicable Merger Consideration in exchange for
surrendered Stock Certificates pursuant to Section 3.1 out of the Exchange
Fund. Except as contemplated by Section 3.2(e), the Exchange Fund shall not
be used for any other purpose.   (b) Promptly after the Effective Time, but
in any event not later than five business days thereafter, Bellwether will
send, or will cause the Exchange Agent to send, to each holder of a Stock
Certificate or Certificates that immediately prior to the Effective Time
represented outstanding Bargo Common Stock or Bargo B Preferred Stock a
letter of transmittal and instructions for use in effecting the exchange of
such Stock Certificates for certificates representing the Stock Consideration
and the Cash Consideration (with respect to the Bargo Common Stock) or the
Preferred Stock Merger Consideration (with respect to the Bargo B Preferred
Stock). Provision also shall be made for holders of Stock Certificates to
procure in person immediately after the Effective Time a letter of
transmittal and instructions and to deliver in person immediately after the
Effective Time such letter of transmittal and Stock Certificates in exchange
for the applicable Merger Consideration.   (c) After the Effective Time,
Stock Certificates shall represent the right, upon surrender thereof to the
Exchange Agent, together with a duly executed and properly completed letter
of transmittal relating thereto, to receive in exchange therefor the
applicable Merger Consideration subject to any required tax withholding, and
the Stock Certificates so surrendered shall be canceled. No interest will be
paid or will accrue on any cash amount payable upon the surrender of any such
Stock Certificates. Until so surrendered, each such Stock Certificate shall,
after the Effective Time, represent for all purposes only the right to
receive the applicable Merger Consideration.     6  11  (d) If any
shares of Bellwether Common Stock are to be issued and/or cash to be paid to
a Person other than the registered holder of the Stock Certificate or
Certificates surrendered in exchange therefor, it shall be a condition to
such issuance or payment that the Stock Certificate or Certificates so
surrendered shall be properly endorsed or otherwise be in proper form
for transfer and that the Person requesting such issuance shall pay to the
Exchange Agent any transfer or other taxes required as a result of such
issuance to a Person other than the registered holder or establish to the
satisfaction of the Exchange Agent that such tax has been paid or is not
applicable. For this Agreement, "PERSON" means an individual, a corporation,
a limited liability company, a partnership, an association, a trust or any
other entity or organization, including a Governmental Authority.   (e) Any
Merger Consideration in the Exchange Fund that remains unclaimed by the
holders of Bargo Common Stock or Bargo B Preferred Stock one year after the
Effective Time shall be returned to Bellwether, upon demand, and any such
holder who has not exchanged such holder\'s Stock Certificates in accordance
with this Section 3.2 prior to that time shall thereafter look only to
Bellwether, as a general creditor thereof, to exchange such
Stock Certificates or to pay amounts to which such holder is entitled
pursuant to Section 3.1. If outstanding Stock Certificates are not
surrendered prior to six years after the Effective Time (or, in any
particular case, prior to such earlier date on which any Merger Consideration
issuable or payable in respect of such Stock Certificates would otherwise
escheat to or become the property of any governmental unit or agency), the
Merger Consideration issuable or payable in respect of such Stock
Certificates shall, to the extent permitted by applicable law, become the
property of Bellwether, free and clear of all claims or interest of any
Person previously entitled thereto. Notwithstanding the foregoing, none of
Bellwether, Bargo or the Surviving Corporation shall be liable to any
holder of Stock Certificates for any amount paid, or Merger Consideration
delivered, to a public official pursuant to applicable abandoned property,
escheat or similar laws.   (f) If any Stock Certificate shall have been
lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by
the Person claiming such Stock Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed
and, if required by the Surviving Corporation, the posting by such Person of
a bond in such reasonable amount as Bellwether may direct as indemnity
against any claim that may be made against it with respect to such Stock
Certificate, the Exchange Agent will issue in exchange for such lost, stolen
or destroyed Stock Certificate the Merger Consideration in respect thereof
pursuant to this Agreement.   3.3 Stock Options. Immediately prior to the
Effective Time, Bargo shall acquire from each holder of employee or director
stock options of Bargo ("BARGO STOCK OPTIONS") and warrants of Bargo ("BARGO
WARRANTS" and, together with the Bargo Stock Options, the "BARGO CONVERTIBLE
SECURITIES") outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time, Bargo
Convertible Securities of such holder representing the Bargo Convertible
Security Cash-Out Amount of such Bargo Convertible Securities in exchange for
cash or at Bargo\'s option, a note which shall be payable immediately after
the Effective Time, equal to the Bargo Convertible Security Cash-Out Amount
of all Bargo Convertible Securities of such holder. Such Bargo Convertible
Securities so acquired shall not be deemed to be outstanding at the Effective
Time. At the Effective Time, Bellwether shall assume all Bargo Convertible
Securities remaining outstanding. Each such Bargo Convertible Security
remaining outstanding after the exchange contemplated by the first sentence
of this Section 3.3 shall become an option or warrant having a cashless
exercise feature      7  12  (a "BELLWETHER OPTION") to purchase that
number of shares of Bellwether Common Stock equal to the quotient of (i) the
sum of (X) the Bargo Convertible Security Value Amount of such Bargo
Convertible Security and (Y) the aggregate exercise price of such Bargo
Convertible Security divided by (ii) the Bellwether Market Price. The
exercise price per share of Bellwether Common Stock with respect to each such
Bellwether Option shall equal the aggregate exercise price of the Bargo
Convertible Security assumed by Bellwether divided by the number of shares of
Bellwether Common Stock for which such Bellwether Option is exercisable.
Such Bellwether Option shall be deemed to be automatically exercised on a
cashless basis immediately after the time a post-effective amendment to the
Registration Statement converting it into a registration statement on Form
S-8 has been declared effective by the Securities and Exchange Commission
(the "SEC"). Prior to the Effective Time, Bargo shall take all steps
necessary to give written notice to each holder of a Bargo Stock Option that
all Bargo Stock Options other than those converted into Bellwether Options
shall be canceled effective as of the Effective Time. Bargo shall use its
reasonable best efforts to cause its Board of Directors or any committee
thereof responsible for the administration of Bargo\'s option plans to take
any and all action necessary to effectuate the matters described in this
Section 3.3 on or before the Effective Time. Any amounts payable pursuant to
this Section 3.3 shall be subject to any required withholding of taxes and
shall be paid without interest.   3.4 No Fractional Shares. No fractional
shares of Bellwether Common Stock shall be issued in the Merger and
fractional share interests shall not entitle the owner thereof to vote or to
any rights of a stockholder of Bellwether. All holders of fractional shares
of Bellwether Common Stock shall be entitled to receive, in lieu thereof, an
amount in cash equal to such fraction times the Bellwether Market Price.  
3.5 Dissenter\'s Rights. Any shares of Bargo Common Stock or Bargo
B Preferred Stock that a stockholder thereof properly exercising its dissent
or appraisal rights under the TBCA (a "DISSENTING STOCKHOLDER") holds will
be converted into the right to receive such consideration as may be
determined to be due to such Dissenting Stockholder under the TBCA; except
that any such shares that a Dissenting Stockholder holds for which, after the

predecessors with the SEC since January 1, 1997 under the Securities Act or

quarterly financial statements, to normal and recurring year-end adjustments)
and fairly present, in conformity with GAAP applied on a consistent basis
(except as may be indicated in the notes thereto), the consolidated financial
position of Bargo and its Subsidiaries as of the date thereof and the
consolidated results of operations and cash flows (and changes in financial
position, if any) of Bargo and its Subsidiaries for the periods presented

the Bargo SEC Reports and (b) for liabilities and obligations incurred in the
ordinary course of business and consistent with past practice since December
31, 1999, neither Bargo nor any of its Subsidiaries has incurred any
liabilities or obligations of any nature (contingent or otherwise) that would
have a Bargo Material Adverse Effect or would be required by GAAP to
be reflected on a consolidated balance sheet of Bargo and its Subsidiaries or
the notes thereto which are not so reflected.   4.8 Absence of Certain
Changes. Except as contemplated by this Agreement, as set forth in Section
4.8 of the Bargo Disclosure Schedule or as disclosed in the Bargo SEC Reports

Subsidiaries have conducted their business in all material respects in the
ordinary course consistent with past practices, (b) there has not been any
change or development, or combination of changes or developments that,
individually or in the aggregate, would have a Bargo Material Adverse Effect,

any declaration, setting aside or payment of any dividend or
other distribution with respect to any shares of capital stock of Bargo, or

of, or other ownership interests in, Bargo or any of its Subsidiaries, (d)
there has not been any amendment of any term of any outstanding security of
Bargo or any of its Subsidiaries, and (e) there has not been any change in
any method of accounting or accounting practice by Bargo or any of its
Subsidiaries, except for any such change required because of a concurrent
change in GAAP or to conform a Subsidiary\'s accounting policies and
practices to those of Bargo.   4.9 Taxes. Except as otherwise disclosed in
Section 4.9 of the Bargo Disclosure Schedule and for matters that would have
no adverse effect on Bargo:   (a) Bargo and each of its Subsidiaries have
timely filed (or have had timely filed on their behalf) or will file or cause
to be timely filed, all material Tax Returns (as defined below) required by
applicable law to be filed by any of them prior to or as of the Closing Date.
All such Tax Returns and amendments thereto are or will be true, complete and
correct in all material respects. All such Tax Returns accurately reflect the
facts, assets, and operations of Bargo and each of its Subsidiaries.    
13  18   (b) Bargo and each of its Subsidiaries have paid (or have had
paid on their behalf), or where payment is not yet due, have established (or

defined below) due with respect to any period ending prior to or as of the
Closing Date.   (c) No Audit (as defined below) by a Tax Authority (as
defined below) is pending or threatened with respect to any Tax Returns filed
by, or Taxes due from, Bargo or any Subsidiary. No issue has been raised by
any Tax Authority in any Audit of Bargo or any of its Subsidiaries that if
raised with respect to any other period not so audited could be expected to
result in a material proposed deficiency for any period not so audited. No
material deficiency or adjustment for any Taxes has been threatened,
proposed, asserted or assessed against Bargo or any of its Subsidiaries.
There are no liens for Taxes upon the assets of Bargo or any of its
Subsidiaries, except liens for current Taxes not yet delinquent.   (d)
Neither Bargo nor any of its Subsidiaries has given or been requested to give
any waiver of statutes of limitations relating to the payment of Taxes or
have executed powers of attorney with respect to Tax matters, which will be
outstanding as of the Closing Date.   (e) Prior to the date hereof, Bargo
and its Subsidiaries have disclosed, and provided or made available true and
complete copies to Bellwether of, all material Tax sharing, Tax indemnity, or
similar agreements to which Bargo or any of its Subsidiaries is a party to,

and any amended Tax Return relating to Taxes.   4.10 Litigation. Except as
disclosed in the Bargo SEC Reports or Section 4.10 of the Bargo Disclosure
Schedule and for matters that would not have a Bargo Material Adverse Effect,
there is no suit, claim, action, proceeding or investigation pending or, to
Bargo\'s knowledge, threatened against or directly affecting Bargo, any
Subsidiaries of Bargo or any of the directors or officers of Bargo or any of
its Subsidiaries in their capacity as such, nor is there any reasonable basis
therefor that could reasonably be expected to have a Bargo Material Adverse
Effect, if adversely determined. Neither Bargo nor any of its Subsidiaries,
nor any officer, director or employee of Bargo or any of its Subsidiaries,
has been permanently or temporarily enjoined by any order, judgment or decree
of any court or any other Governmental Authority from engaging in or
continuing any conduct or practice in connection with the business, assets or
properties of Bargo or such Subsidiary nor, to the knowledge of Bargo, is
Bargo, any Subsidiary or any officer, director or employee of Bargo or its
Subsidiaries under investigation by any Governmental Authority. Except
as disclosed in the Bargo SEC Reports or Section 4.10 of the      14 
19  Bargo Disclosure Schedule, there is not in existence any order, judgment
or decree of any court or other tribunal or other agency enjoining or
requiring Bargo or any of its Subsidiaries to take any action of any kind
with respect to its business, assets or properties. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, no representation or warranty in this Section 4.10 is made with
respect to Environmental Laws, which are covered exclusively by the
provisions set forth in Section 4.12.   4.11 Employee Benefit Plans;
ERISA.   (a) Section 4.11(a) of the Bargo Disclosure Schedule contains
a true and complete list of all employee benefit plans or arrangements
(written or oral) of any type (including plans described in Section 3(3) of
the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended ("ERISA")),
sponsored, maintained or contributed to by Bargo or any trade or business,
whether or not incorporated, which together with Bargo would be deemed a
"single employer" within the meaning of Section 414(b), (c) or (m) of the
Code or section 4001(b)(1) of ERISA (a "BARGO ERISA AFFILIATE") within six
years prior to the Effective Time ("BARGO BENEFIT Plans").   (b) With
respect to each Bargo Benefit Plan: (i) if intended to qualify under Section
401(a) or 401(k) of the Code, such plan satisfies the requirements of such
sections, has received a favorable determination letter from the Internal
Revenue Service with respect to its qualification, and its related trust has
been determined to be exempt from tax under Section 501(a) of the Code and,
to the knowledge of Bargo, nothing has occurred since the date of such letter
to adversely affect such qualification or exemption; (ii) each such plan has
been administered in substantial compliance with its terms and applicable
law, except for any noncompliance with respect to any such plan that could
not reasonably be expected to result in a Bargo Material Adverse
Effect; (iii) neither Bargo nor any Bargo ERISA Affiliate has engaged in, and
Bargo and each Bargo ERISA Affiliate do not have any knowledge of any Person
that has engaged in, any transaction or acted or failed to act in any manner
that would subject Bargo or any Bargo ERISA Affiliate to any liability for a
breach of fiduciary duty under ERISA that could reasonably be expected to
result in a Bargo Material Adverse Effect; (iv) no disputes are pending or,
to the knowledge of Bargo or any Bargo ERISA Affiliate, threatened; (v)
neither Bargo nor any Bargo ERISA Affiliate has engaged in, and Bargo and
each Bargo ERISA Affiliate do not have any knowledge of any Person that has
engaged in, any transaction in violation of Section 406(a) or (b) of ERISA or
Section 4975 of the Code for which no exemption exists under Section 408 of
ERISA or Section 4975(c) of the Code or Section 4975(d) of the Code or that
would result in a civil penalty being imposed under subsections (i) or (l) of
Section 502 of ERISA, in either case that could reasonably be expected to
result in a Bargo Material Adverse Effect; (vi) there have been no
"reportable events" within the meaning of Section 4043 of ERISA for which the
30 day notice requirement of ERISA has not been waived by the Pension Benefit
Guaranty Corporation (the "PBGC"); (vii) all contributions due have been made
on a timely basis (within, where applicable, the time limit established under
Section 302 of ERISA or Code Section 412); (viii) no notice of intent to
terminate such plan has been given under Section 4041 of ERISA and no
proceeding has been instituted under Section 4042 of ERISA to terminate such
plan; (ix) no Bargo Benefit Plan is a plan covered by Title IV of ERISA or
subject to the funding requirements of Code Section 412; (x) except to the
extent required under ERISA Section 601 et seq. and Code Section
4980B, neither Bargo nor any Bargo ERISA Affiliate provides health or welfare
benefits for any retired or former employee or is obligated to provide health
or welfare benefits to any      15  20  active employee following
such employee\'s retirement or other termination of service; (xi) assuming
the Merger closes after April 15, 2001 and that the closing price of the
Bellwether Common Stock on the date of the Effective Time is $9.00 or less,
then no payment that is owed or may become due to any director, officer,
employee, or agent of any Bargo or Bargo ERISA Affiliate will be non-
deductible to Bargo or Bargo ERISA Affiliate or subject to tax under
Code Section 280G or Section 4999, nor will Bargo or any Bargo ERISA
Affiliate be required to "gross-up" or otherwise compensate any such person
because of the imposition of any excise tax on a payment to such person;
(xiii) the termination of any Bargo Benefit Plan would not result in any
material liability or further obligation on the part of Bargo or any Bargo
ERISA Affiliate; and (xiv) except as would not cause a Bargo Material Adverse
Effect, all reports and other documents required to be filed by any of the
Bargo Benefit Plans with any governmental agency or distributed to plan
participants or beneficiaries (including notices required by the Consolidated
Omnibus Reconciliation Act of 1986, actuarial reports, audits, or tax
returns) have been timely filed or distributed. All contributions made or
required to be made under any Bargo Benefit Plan meet the requirements for
deductibility under the Code, and all contributions which are required and
which have not been made have been properly recorded on the books of Bargo or
a Bargo ERISA Affiliate.   (c) No Bargo Benefit Plan is a "multi-employer
plan" (as defined in Section 4001(a)(3) of ERISA) or a "multiple employer
plan" (within the meaning of Section 413(c) of the Code). No event has
occurred with respect to Bargo or a Bargo ERISA Affiliate in connection with
which Bargo could be subject to any liability, lien or encumbrance with
respect to any Bargo Benefit Plan or any employee benefit plan described in
Section 3(3) of ERISA maintained, sponsored or contributed to by a Bargo
ERISA Affiliate under ERISA or the Code.   (d) Except as set forth in
Section 4.11(d) of the Bargo Disclosure Schedule, no employees of Bargo or
any of its Subsidiaries are covered by any severance plan or similar
arrangement.   4.12 Environmental Liability. Except as set forth in Section
4.12 of the Bargo Disclosure Schedule:   (a) The businesses of Bargo and
its Subsidiaries have been and are operated in material compliance with all

wastes, toxic substances, hazardous substances, petroleum, petroleum products
or any substance regulated under any Environmental Law ("HAZARDOUS
SUBSTANCES") at any of its properties or facilities, except in material
compliance with all Environmental Laws, and, to Bargo\'s knowledge,
no      16  21  generation, manufacture, processing, distribution,
use, treatment, handling, storage, discharge, release, disposal, transport or
handling of any Hazardous Substances has occurred at any property or facility
owned, leased or operated by Bargo or any of its Subsidiaries except in
material compliance with all Environmental Laws.   (c) Neither Bargo nor
any of its Subsidiaries has received any written notice from any Governmental
Authority or third party or, to the knowledge of Bargo, any other
communication alleging or concerning any material violation by Bargo or any
of its Subsidiaries of, or responsibility or liability of Bargo or any of its
Subsidiaries under, any Environmental Law (or as regards environmental
conditions under the common law). There are no pending, or to the knowledge
of Bargo, threatened, claims, suits, actions, proceedings or investigations
with respect to the businesses or operations of Bargo or any of its
Subsidiaries alleging or concerning any material violation of
or responsibility or liability under any Environmental Law (or as
regards environmental conditions under the common law) that, if adversely
determined, could reasonably be expected to have a Bargo Material Adverse
Effect, nor does Bargo have any knowledge of any fact or condition that could
give rise to such a claim, suit, action, proceeding or investigation.   (d)
Bargo and its Subsidiaries are in possession of all material approvals,
permits, licenses, registrations and similar type authorizations from, and
have filed all material notices and registrations with, all Governmental
Authorities under all Environmental Laws with respect to the operation of the
businesses of Bargo and its Subsidiaries; there are no pending or, to the
knowledge of Bargo, threatened, actions, proceedings or investigations
seeking to modify, revoke or deny renewal of any of such approvals, permits,
licenses, registrations and authorizations; and Bargo does not have knowledge
of any fact or condition that is reasonably likely to give rise to any
action, proceeding or investigation to modify, revoke or deny renewal of any

Material Adverse Effect; (iv) no disputes are pending, or, to the knowledge
of Bellwether or any Bellwether ERISA Affiliate, threatened; (v) neither

ERISA or Section 4975 of the Code for which no exemption exists under Section
408 of ERISA or Section 4975(c) of the Code or Section 4975(d) of the Code or
that would result in a civil penalty being imposed under subsections (i) or
(l) of Section 502 of ERISA, in either case that could reasonably be expected

"reportable events" within the meaning of Section 4043 of ERISA for which the

employee following such employee\'s retirement or other termination

director, officer, employee, or agent of any Bellwether or Bellwether ERISA

the Bellwether or any Bellwether ERISA Affiliate be required to "gross-up" or
otherwise compensate any such person because of the imposition of any excise
tax on a payment to such person; (xiii) the termination of any Bellwether
Benefit Plan would not result in any material liability or further obligation
on the part of the Bellwether or any Bellwether ERISA Affiliate; and (xiv)
except as would not cause a Bellwether Material Adverse Effect, all reports
and other documents required to be filed by any of the Bellwether Benefit
Plans with any governmental agency or distributed to plan participants or
beneficiaries (including notices required by the Consolidated Omnibus
Reconciliation Act of 1986, actuarial reports, audits, or tax returns) have

Intellectual Property. Bellwether or its Subsidiaries own, or are licensed or
otherwise have the right to use, all Intellectual Property currently used in
the conduct of the business of Bellwether and its Subsidiaries, except where

Intellectual Property would not, individually or in the aggregate, have a
Bellwether Material Adverse Effect. No Person has notified either Bellwether
or any of its Subsidiaries that their use of the Intellectual Property
infringes on the rights of any Person, subject to such claims and
infringements as do not, individually or in the aggregate, give rise to any
liability on the part of Bellwether and its Subsidiaries that could have a
Bellwether Material Adverse Effect, and, to Bellwether\'s knowledge, no
Person is infringing on any right of Bellwether or any of its Subsidiaries
with respect to any such Intellectual Property. No claims are pending or, to
Bellwether\'s knowledge, threatened that Bellwether or any of its
Subsidiaries is infringing or otherwise adversely affecting the rights of any
Person with regard to any Intellectual Property.   5.22 Hedging. Section

the price of commodities, including Hydrocarbons or securities.   5.23
Brokers. No broker, finder or investment banker (other than Johnson Rice and
Company the fees and expenses of which will be paid by Bellwether) is
entitled to any brokerage, finder\'s fee or other fee or commission payable

and Company (the "BELLWETHER ENGAGEMENT LETTERS") have been provided to

related transactions. Bellwether has not agreed to assume, nor will it
directly or indirectly assume, any expense or other liability, whether fixed

of Bellwether, Bargo and its Subsidiaries on a case-by-case basis. Prior to
the Effective Time, Bellwether shall cause each Bellwether stock option plan
to be amended to provide that the transaction contemplated by this Agreement
shall constitute an event causing the acceleration of vesting of all stock
options thereunder. The parties acknowledge and agree that, except
as contemplated by      47  52  the preceding sentence, the
transaction contemplated hereby is not a change of control for the purposes
of any of Bellwether\'s or its Subsidiaries\' contracts or other agreements.
Prior to the Effective Time, Bargo shall cause (a) each Bargo stock option
plan to be amended such that the transaction contemplated by this Agreement
shall constitute an event causing the acceleration of vesting of all stock
options thereunder, (b) each Bargo Benefit Plan that is an employee pension

Effective Time, and (c) the employment or severance agreements with the
individuals listed on Section 7.11 of the Bargo Disclosure Schedule to be
treated as follows: (x) those that are identified as being amended, to be
amended such that the consummation of the transaction contemplated by this
Agreement shall constitute a change of control for purposes thereunder and
that such change of control in itself shall trigger the requirement to make
all payments related to a change of control thereunder notwithstanding the
current existence of additional conditions in such agreements to such
payments, and (y) those identified to continue outstanding shall continue to
do so (Bellwether hereby acknowledges that the Merger constitutes a "change
of control" for such agreements). After the Effective Time, Bellwether will
initially provide to any employees of Bargo and its Subsidiaries who are
employed by Bellwether as of the Effective Time (the "RETAINED EMPLOYEES")
the same or better base salary or wages provided to such employees prior to

be determined by Bellwether after the Effective Time. Bellwether shall take
all actions necessary or appropriate to permit the Retained Employees to
continue to participate from and after the Effective Time in the

were participating immediately prior to the Effective Time. Notwithstanding
the foregoing, Bellwether may permit any such employee benefit plan or
arrangement to be terminated or discontinued on or after the Effective Time,
provided that Bellwether shall (a) take all actions necessary or appropriate
to permit the Retained Employees participating in such employee benefit plan
or arrangement to immediately thereafter participate in employee benefit
plans or arrangements (the "REPLACEMENT PLANS") providing the same or better
benefits than those previously maintained by Bargo with respect to the
Retained Employees prior to the Merger, (b) with respect to a Replacement
Plan that is a group health plan (i) credit such Retained Employees, for the
year during which participation in the Replacement Plan begins, with any
deductibles and copayments already incurred during such year under the

condition limitations applicable to the Retained Employees (and their
eligible dependents) under the Replacement Plan to the extent that a Retained
Employee\'s (or dependent\'s) condition would not have operated as a
preexisting condition under the terminated or discontinued group health plan,
and (c)(1) cause each Replacement Plan that is an employee pension benefit
plan (as such term is defined in Section 3(2) of ERISA) intended to
be qualified under Section 401 of the Code to be amended to provide that
the Retained Employees shall receive credit for participation and vesting
purposes under such plan for their period of employment with Bargo, its
Subsidiaries and their predecessors to the extent such predecessor employment
was recognized by Bargo and its Subsidiaries and (2) credit the Retained
Employees under each other Replacement Plan that is not described in the
preceding clause for their period of employment with Bargo, its Subsidiaries
and their predecessors to the extent such predecessor employment was
recognized by Bargo or its Subsidiaries. At the Effective Time, Bellwether
shall assume the obligations of Bargo under the Bargo Benefit Plans and the
agreements contemplated by clause (c)(y) above. The terms of each     
48  53  such Bargo Benefit Plan shall continue to apply in accordance with
their terms. At the Effective Time, each outstanding award (including
restricted stock, phantom stock, stock equivalents and stock units) ("BARGO
AWARD") under any employee incentive or benefit plans, programs or
arrangements and non-employee director plans presently maintained by Bargo
which provide for grants of equity-based awards shall be amended or converted
into a similar instrument of Bellwether, in each case with such adjustments
to the terms of such Bargo Awards as are appropriate to preserve the value
inherent in such Bargo Awards with no detrimental effects on the holders
thereof. The other terms of each Bargo Award, and the plans or agreements
under which they were issued, shall continued to apply in accordance with
their terms. Bellwether agrees to pay (x) up to $100,000 in the aggregate to
certain employees of Bargo designated by Bargo who will not be Retained

such employees for the lesser of (I) six months from the Closing and (II) the
date such employees become covered under alternate health insurance
coverage.   7.12 Board, Committees and Executive Officers.   (a)

Bellwether shall select from among the current members of the Board of
Directors of Bellwether four individuals (which shall include Douglas

Bellwether, and (ii) the Board of Directors of Bargo shall select from among
the current members of the Board of Directors of Bargo three individuals
(which nominees shall be Tim Goff, Jonathan Clarkson and Martin Phillips)
(the "BARGO DIRECTOR NOMINEES") for nomination as directors of Bellwether.
Bellwether shall use its best efforts to cause the members of its Board of
Directors that are not Bellwether Director Nominees to either resign their
position or be removed from their position. In addition, Bellwether shall use
its best efforts to cause the Bargo Director Nominees to be elected as
members of Bellwether\'s Board of Directors by Bellwether\'s existing Board
of Directors simultaneous with Closing. The Bargo Director Nominees will
serve as directors for a term expiring at Bellwether\'s next annual meeting
of stockholders following the Effective Time, provided that Bellwether will
use its best efforts to cause its Board to re-nominate them as directors for
election at the following annual meeting at the discretion of Bellwether\'s
Board of Directors. If at any time prior to the Effective Time, any Bargo
Director Nominee or Bellwether Director Nominee shall be unable to serve as a
director at the Effective Time, the respective Board of Directors
that designated such individual as provided herein shall designate another
individual to serve in such individual\'s PLACE; provided that if Douglas
Manner is unable to serve as Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive
Officer, Jonathan Clarkson shall serve as Chairman of the Board and Chief

subsequent to the Effective Time; provided, further, if Jonathan Clarkson is

positions set forth opposite      49  54  their respective names on
such Exhibit until the earlier of the resignation or removal of any such
individual or until their respective successors are duly elected and
qualified, as the case may be. Prior to the Effective Time, Bellwether and
Bargo may mutually agree to designate additional individuals to serve as
executive officers of Bellwether subsequent to the Effective Time. Subject to
Section 7.12(a), if any executive officer set forth on Exhibit 7.12(b) or
designated in accordance with this Section 7.12(b) ceases to be a fulltime
employee of either Bellwether or Bargo (or otherwise declines to serve in

agree to leave such office vacant through the Effective Time.   7.13

good faith that such action is necessary for such Board of Directors to
comply with its fiduciary duties under applicable law.   (b) Bellwether
shall, as promptly as reasonably practicable after the date hereof (i) take

Bellwether Stockholders\' Approval, (y) approving an amendment to
Bellwether\'s Certification of Incorporation (the "POST-CLOSING AMENDMENT"),

the effect of which would be to (A) increase the number of authorized shares
of Bellwether Common Stock to 60,000,000, and (B) increase the number of
authorized shares of preferred stock of Bellwether to 5,000,000, and (z)

under applicable law.   (c) If a Bellwether Superior Proposal is received
and Bellwether accepts such Bellwether Superior Proposal and thereby
terminates this Agreement under Section 10.1(j), then, unless Bargo
terminates this Agreement under Section 10.1(j), prior to the termination of
this Agreement taking effect under Section 10.1(j), Bellwether shall be
obligated to comply with Section 7.13(b) and the other terms of this
Agreement, including by holding the Bellwether Special Meeting. If the
stockholders of Bellwether do not approve the Merger at such meeting, then at
such time this Agreement shall be deemed to be terminated by Bellwether under
Section 10.1(j), and, on the first business day after Bellwether\'s
stockholders fail to approve the Merger, Bellwether shall pay to Bargo the
Termination Fee and Expenses contemplated by Section 7.5.
