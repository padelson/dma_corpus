<P align="center" style="font-size: 10pt">REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF PARENT AND SUB



<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Parent and Sub jointly and severally represent and warrant to the Company as set forth below.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Section&nbsp;4.1. <U>Organization and Power</U>. Parent is a corporation duly organized, validly existing and in good standing under the
Laws of the State of Delaware, and has the requisite corporate or other power and authority to own,
lease and operate its properties and to carry on its business as now being conducted. Sub is duly
organized and validly existing under the Laws of the State of Indiana. Parent is duly qualified or
licensed to do business and is in good standing in each jurisdiction in which the property owned,
leased or operated by it or the nature of the business conducted by it makes such qualification or
licensing necessary, except where the failure to be so duly qualified or licensed and in good
standing individually or in the aggregate has not had and would not reasonably be expected to have
a Parent Material Adverse Effect.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As used in this Agreement, the term &#147;<U>Parent Material Adverse Effect</U>&#148; means, when used
with reference to one or more events, changes, circumstances or effects, a material adverse effect
on the business, operations, assets, liabilities or financial condition of Parent and its
Subsidiaries taken as a whole.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Section&nbsp;4.2. <U>Corporate Authorization</U>. Each of Parent and Sub has all necessary power
and authority to enter into this Agreement, to perform its obligations hereunder and to consummate
the transactions contemplated hereby. The execution, delivery and performance by Parent and Sub of
this Agreement and the consummation by Parent and Sub of the transactions contemplated hereby have
been duly authorized by all necessary corporate action, including by resolution of the Board of
Directors of Parent and Sub, and have been adopted by Parent as the sole stockholder of Sub. No
vote of any class or series of Parent&#146;s capital stock and no further vote of any capital stock of
Sub is necessary in connection with the execution of this Agreement and the consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby. This Agreement has been duly executed and delivered by each of
Parent and Sub and, assuming the due authorization, execution and delivery by the Company,
constitutes a valid and binding agreement of each of Parent and Sub, enforceable against Parent and
Sub, as applicable, in accordance with its terms (subject to applicable bankruptcy, insolvency,
reorganization, moratorium, fraudulent transfer and other similar Laws affecting creditors&#146; rights
generally from time to time in effect and to general principles of equity, good faith and fair
dealing, regardless of whether in a proceeding at equity or at Law).

such reference shall be to a Section of this Agreement unless otherwise indicated. Whenever the

hereof&#148;, and terms of similar import, unless the context otherwise requires, shall be deemed to
refer to July&nbsp;21, 2005. As used in this Agreement, the term &#147;affiliate(s)&#148; shall have the meaning
set forth in Rule&nbsp;12b-2 of the Exchange Act. For purposes of this Agreement, words in the singular
shall be held to include the plural and vice versa and words of one gender shall be held to include
the other gender as the context requires. As used in this Agreement, the terms &#147;hereof&#148;, &#147;herein&#148;,

<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Section&nbsp;8.6. <U>Counterparts</U>. This Agreement may be executed in two or more
counterparts, all of which shall be considered one and the same agreement and shall become

agreements and understandings, both written and oral, among the parties hereto with respect to the
subject matter hereof, and (b)&nbsp;except as provided in Section&nbsp;5.10 with respect to the obligations

conditions and provisions of this Agreement shall nevertheless remain in full force and effect so
long as the economic or legal substance of the transactions contemplated hereby is not affected in
any manner materially adverse to any party. Upon such determination that any term or other
provision is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced, the parties hereto shall negotiate in
good faith to modify this Agreement so as to effect the original intent of the parties as closely
as possible in a mutually acceptable manner in order that the transactions contemplated hereby may
be consummated as originally contemplated to the fullest extent possible.
