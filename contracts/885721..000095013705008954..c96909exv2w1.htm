 _AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER_     

 AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER (this " _Agreement_ "), dated as of July 21, 2005, by and among EXPRESS SCRIPTS, INC., a Delaware corporation (" _Parent_ "), PONY ACQUISITION CORPORATION, an Indiana corporation and a wholly owned subsidiary of Parent (" _Sub_ "), and PRIORITY HEALTHCARE CORPORATION, an Indiana corporation (the " _Company_ ").   

 WHEREAS, the Board of Directors of the Company has (i) determined that the Merger, including the consideration to be paid for each outstanding share (collectively, the " _Shares_ ") of (A) Class A Common Stock, par value $.01 per share, of the Company (the " _Class A Company Common Stock_") and (B) Class B Common Stock, par value $.01 per share, of the Company (the " _Class B Company Common Stock_ ", and together with the Class A Common Stock, the " _Company Common Stock_ ") in the Merger is fair to, advisable and in the best interests of the Company and its shareholders, (ii) adopted this Agreement and the Merger and (iii) resolved to recommend approval of this Agreement and the Merger by such shareholders;   

 WHEREAS, the Boards of Directors of Parent and Sub have approved, and deem it advisable to enter into, the Merger Agreement;   

 WHEREAS, as a condition and inducement to Parents and Subs entering into this Agreement and incurring the obligations set forth herein, concurrently with the execution and delivery of this Agreement, Parent and Sub are entering into a Voting Agreement (the " _Voting Agreement_ ") with William E. Bindley (" _Mr. Bindley_") in his individual capacity and with certain charitable remainder and grantor retained annuity trusts (the " _Trusts_ ") of which Mr. Bindley is the sole trustee, pursuant to which, among other things, each of Mr. Bindley and the Trusts has agreed to vote the shares of Company Common Stock then owned by him or it in favor of the approval of this Agreement and the Merger; and   

 WHEREAS, the Board of Directors of the Company has approved in advance the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the Voting Agreement for purposes of the provisions of Section 23-1-43 of the Indiana Business Corporation Law (the " _IBCL_ ") and has amended its By-laws to provide that the provisions of Section 23-1-42 shall not be applicable to the Company.   

 NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing and the respective representations, warranties, covenants and agreements set forth herein, the parties hereto agree as follows:   

ARTICLE I    

THE MERGER    

 Section 1.1. _The Merger_. Upon the terms and subject to the conditions of this Agreement, and in accordance with the IBCL, at the Effective Time, Sub shall be merged with and into the Company (the " _Merger_ "). As a result of the Merger, the separate corporate    ##### 

  

 

existence of Sub shall cease and the Company shall continue as the surviving
corporation of the Merger (the " _Surviving Corporation_ ").    

 Section 1.2. _Closing_. Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement, the closing of the Merger (the " _Closing_ ") shall take place at 10:00 a.m. on a date (the " _Closing Date_ ") which shall be the second business day after satisfaction or waiver of the conditions set forth in Article VI, other than those conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied at the Closing, but subject to the fulfillment or waiver of those conditions, at the offices of Simpson Thacher and Bartlett LLP, 425 Lexington Avenue, New York, New York 10017 or at such other time, date or place as agreed to in writing by the parties hereto.   

 Section 1.3. _Effective Time_. Upon the Closing, the parties hereto shall cause the Merger to be consummated by filing articles of merger (the " _Articles of Merger_ ") with the Secretary of State of the State of Indiana, in such form as required by, and executed in accordance with the relevant provisions of, the IBCL. The date and time of the filing of the Articles of Merger with the Secretary of State of the State of Indiana (or such later time as shall be agreed to by the parties hereto and is specified in the Articles of Merger) will be the " _Effective Time_ ".   

 Section 1.4. _Effects of the Merger_. The Merger shall have the effects set forth in the applicable provisions of the IBCL. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, and subject thereto, at the Effective Time all the property, rights, privileges, immunities, powers and franchises of the Company and Sub shall vest in the Surviving Corporation, and all debts, liabilities and duties of the Company and Sub shall become the debts, liabilities and duties of the Surviving Corporation.   

 Section 1.5. _Articles of Incorporation; By-laws_. (a) At the Effective Time and without any further action on the part of the Company or Sub, the restated articles of incorporation of the Company as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be the articles of incorporation of the Surviving Corporation until thereafter amended as provided therein and under the IBCL.   

 (a) At the Effective Time and without any further action on the part of the Company or Sub, the by-laws of the Company, as amended, as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be the by-laws of the Surviving Corporation and thereafter may be amended or repealed in accordance with their terms or the articles of incorporation of the Surviving Corporation and as provided by Law.   

 Section 1.6. _Directors and Officers_. The directors of Sub immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be the initial directors of the Surviving Corporation, each to hold office in accordance with the articles of incorporation and by-laws of the Surviving Corporation, and the officers of the Company immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be the initial officers of the Surviving Corporation, in each case until their respective successors are duly elected or appointed (as the case may be) and qualified.     ##### 

  

     

ARTICLE II    

CONVERSION OF SHARES; SHAREHOLDERS MEETING    

 Section 2.1. _Conversion of Securities_. At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of Sub, the Company or the holders of any of the following securities:   

 (a) Each Share issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than any Shares to be cancelled pursuant to Section 2.1(b), Shares owned by Sub or any other wholly-owned Subsidiary of Parent or of the Company which shall remain outstanding and any Dissenting Shares) shall be cancelled, extinguished and converted automatically into the right to receive an amount equal to $28 per share in cash (the " _Merger Consideration_ ") payable to the holder thereof, without interest, upon surrender of the certificate that prior to the Merger represented such Share in the manner provided in Section 2.4, less any required withholding taxes.   

 (b) Each Share held in the treasury of the Company and each Share owned by Parent immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be cancelled and retired without any conversion thereof and no payment or distribution shall be made with respect thereto.   

 (c) Each share of common stock of Sub issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be converted into and become one validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable share of Class B Common Stock of the Surviving Corporation.   

 Section 2.2. _Treatment of Company Stock Options and Restricted Stock_.   

 (a) At the Effective Time, each then outstanding option to purchase Shares (collectively, a " _Company Stock Option_ "), granted pursuant to the Companys 1997 Stock Option and Incentive Plan, the Broad Based Stock Option Plan and the Outside Directors Stock Plan (" _Company Stock Plans_ ") whether or not then vested or exercisable, shall be cancelled by the Company, and each holder of a cancelled Company Stock Option shall be entitled to receive at the Effective Time or as soon as practicable thereafter from the Surviving Corporation (and, if necessary, Parent shall provide funds to the Surviving Corporation sufficient for such payments) in consideration for the cancellation of such Company Stock Option an amount in cash equal to the product of (i) the number of shares of Company Common Stock previously subject to such Company Stock Option and (ii) the excess, if any, of the Merger Consideration over the exercise price per share of Company Common Stock previously subject to such Company Stock Option.   

 (b) At the Effective Time, each share of restricted stock (a " _Restricted Share_ " and, collectively, the " _Restricted Shares_ ") outstanding as of the Effective Time and issued pursuant to the Company Stock Plans providing for the grant of Restricted Share awards, to the extent not already vested, shall vest and shall represent a right to receive the same rights provided to other holders of Company Common Stock pursuant to Section 2.1 above.   

 (c) Except as provided herein or as otherwise agreed to by the parties, all stock incentive plans and any other plan, program or arrangement providing for the issuance or     ##### 

  

     

grant of any interest in respect of the Shares shall terminate as of the
Effective Time, and the Company shall, prior to the Effective Time, ensure
that following the Effective Time no holder of any Company Stock Option nor
any holder of a Restricted Share or any other equity-based right shall have
any right to acquire equity securities of the Company or the Surviving
Corporation (except to the extent required under any tax-qualified retirement
plan maintained by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries prior to the
Effective Time).    

 Section 2.3. _Dissenting Shares_. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, Shares of Class A Company Common Stock that are issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time and which are held by shareholders who have not voted in favor of or consented to the Merger and who shall have delivered a written demand for appraisal of such shares of Company Common Stock in the time and manner provided in Section 23-1-44 of the IBCL and shall not have failed to perfect or shall not have effectively withdrawn or lost their rights to appraisal and payment under the IBCL (the " _Dissenting Shares_ ") shall not be converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration, but shall be entitled to receive the fair value of their Shares of Class A Company Common Stock as shall be determined pursuant to Section 23-1-44 of the IBCL; _provided_ , _however_ , that if such holder shall have failed to perfect or shall have effectively withdrawn or lost his, her or its right to appraisal and payment under the IBCL, such holders Shares of Class A Company Common Stock shall thereupon be deemed to have been converted, at the Effective Time, into the right to receive the Merger Consideration set forth in Section 2.1(a) of this Agreement, without any interest thereon, less any required withholding taxes. The Company shall give Parent (a) prompt notice of any demands for appraisal pursuant to Section 23-1-44 of the IBCL received by the Company, withdrawals of such demands, and any other instruments served pursuant to the IBCL and received by the Company and (b) the opportunity to direct all negotiations and proceedings with respect to demands for appraisal under the IBCL. The Company shall not, except with the prior written consent of Parent, make any payment with respect to any such demands for appraisal or offer to settle or settle any such demands.   

 Section 2.4. _Surrender of Shares; Stock Transfer Books._ (a) Prior to the Effective Time, Sub shall designate a bank or trust company (which shall be reasonably satisfactory to the Company) to act as agent for the holders of Shares in connection with the Merger (the " _Paying Agent_ ") to receive the Merger Consideration to which holders of Shares shall become entitled pursuant to Section 2.1(a). When and as needed, Parent or Sub will make, or will cause to be made, available to the Paying Agent sufficient funds to make all payments pursuant to Section 2.4(b). Such funds shall be invested by the Paying Agent as directed by Sub or, after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation, provided that such investments shall be in obligations of or guaranteed by the United States of America, in commercial paper obligations rated A-1 or P-1 or better by Moodys Investors Service, Inc. or Standard and Poors Rating Services, respectively, or in deposit accounts, certificates of deposit, bank repurchase or reverse repurchase agreements or bankers acceptances of, or Eurodollar time deposits purchased from, commercial banks with capital exceeding $250 million (based on the most recent financial statements of such bank which are then publicly available at the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (" _SEC_ ") or otherwise). Any net profit resulting from, or interest or income produced by, such investments will be payable to the Surviving Corporation or Parent, as Parent directs.     ##### 

  

      

 (b) As soon as practicable after the Effective Time (but in no event more than five business days after the Effective Time), the Surviving Corporation shall cause to be mailed to each record holder, as of the Effective Time, of an outstanding certificate or certificates which immediately prior to the Effective Time represented Shares (the " _Certificates_ "), a letter of transmittal (which shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the Certificates shall pass, only upon proper delivery of the Certificates to the Paying Agent, and shall be in such form and have such other provisions not inconsistent with this Agreement as Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall reasonably specify) and instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the Certificates for payment of the Merger Consideration therefor. Upon surrender to the Paying Agent of a Certificate, together with such letter of transmittal, duly completed and validly executed in accordance with the instructions thereto, and such other documents as may be required pursuant to such instructions, the holder of such Certificate shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor the Merger Consideration for each Share formerly represented by such Certificate, and such Certificate shall then be cancelled. Until so surrendered, each Certificate will represent, from and after the Effective Time, only the right to receive the Merger Consideration in cash as contemplated by this Article II. No interest shall be paid or accrued for the benefit of holders of the Certificates on the Merger Consideration payable upon the surrender of the Certificates. If payment of the Merger Consideration is to be made to a Person other than the Person in whose name the surrendered Certificate is registered, it shall be a condition of payment that the Certificate so surrendered shall be properly endorsed or shall be otherwise in proper form for transfer and that the Person requesting such payment shall have paid any transfer and other taxes required by reason of the payment of the Merger Consideration to a Person other than the registered holder of the Certificate surrendered or shall have established to the satisfaction of the Surviving Corporation that such tax either has been paid or is not applicable. As used in this Agreement, " _Person_ " means an individual, corporation, limited liability company, partnership, association, trust, unincorporated organization, other entity or group (as defined in the Exchange Act).   

 (c) In the event any Certificates shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, the Paying Agent shall deliver in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificates, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the holder thereof, the Merger Consideration to which the holder thereof is entitled pursuant to this Article II; _provided_ , _however_ , that Parent or the Surviving Corporation may, as a condition precedent to such delivery, require the owner of such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificates to deliver a bond in such sum as they may reasonably direct as indemnity against any claim that may be made against Parent, the Surviving Corporation, the Company or the Paying Agent with respect to the Certificates alleged to have been lost, stolen or destroyed.   

 (d) At any time following six months after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall be entitled to require the Paying Agent to deliver to it any funds (including any interest and other income received with respect thereto) which had been made available to the Paying Agent and which have not been disbursed to holders of Certificates, and thereafter such holders shall be entitled to look to the Surviving Corporation (subject to abandoned property, escheat or other similar Laws) only as general creditors thereof with respect to the Merger Consideration payable, without interest, to which such holders may be entitled pursuant to this Article II. Notwithstanding the foregoing, none of the Surviving Corporation, the Paying Agent     ##### 

  

     

or any party hereto shall be liable to any Person in respect of any Merger
Consideration delivered to a public official pursuant to any applicable
abandoned property, escheat or similar Law.    

 (e) At the close of business on the day of the Effective Time, the stock transfer books of the Company shall be closed and thereafter there shall be no further registration of transfers of shares of Company Common Stock on the records of the Company. From and after the Effective Time, the holders of Certificates evidencing ownership of Shares outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall cease to have any rights with respect to such Shares except as otherwise provided for herein or by applicable Law.   

 Section 2.5. _Withholding Taxes_. Each of the Paying Agent, the Company, Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the Merger Consideration or Merger Consideration otherwise payable to a holder of Company Common Stock, Company Stock Options or Restricted Shares, as the case may be, pursuant to the Merger such amounts as the Paying Agent, the Company, Parent or the Surviving Corporation is required to deduct and withhold with respect to the making of such payment under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the " _Code_ "), or under any applicable provision of state, local or foreign Law. To the extent that amounts are so withheld, such amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the holder of the Company Common Stock, Company Stock Options or Restricted Shares, as the case may be, in respect of which such deduction and withholding was made by the Paying Agent, the Company, Parent or the Surviving Corporation, respectively.   

 Section 2.6. _Further Action_. At and after the Effective Time, the officers and directors of Parent and the Surviving Corporation will be authorized to execute and deliver, in the name and on behalf of the Company and Sub, any deeds, bills of sale, assignments or assurances and to take and do, in the name and on behalf of the Company and Sub, any other actions and things to vest, perfect or confirm of record or otherwise in the Surviving Corporation any and all right, title and interest in, to and under any of the rights, properties or assets acquired or to be acquired by the Surviving Corporation as a result of, or in connection with, the Merger.   

ARTICLE III    

REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF THE COMPANY    

 The Company hereby represents and warrants to Parent and Sub as follows:   

 Section 3.1. _Organization; Subsidiaries; Charter Documents_.   

 (a) _Organization_. Each of the Company and its Significant Subsidiaries is a corporation, partnership or other entity duly organized, validly existing and in good standing (where applicable) under the Laws of the jurisdiction of its incorporation or organization, and has the requisite corporate or other power and authority to own, lease and operate its properties and to carry on its business as now being conducted. Each Subsidiary of the Company that is not a Significant Subsidiary is a corporation, partnership or other entity duly organized, validly existing and in good standing under the Laws of the jurisdiction of its incorporation or organization, and has the requisite corporate or other power and authority to own, lease and     ##### 

  

     

operate its properties and to carry on its business as now being conducted,
except where the failure to be so duly organized, validly existing and in
good standing or to have such requisite corporate or other power and

Company or any of its Subsidiaries or a threat that the Company or any of

this Agreement, with respect to the accuracy of any representation or
warranty of the Company.    

 Section 6.3. _Conditions to the Obligations of the Company_. The obligations of the Company to consummate the Merger are subject to the satisfaction (or waiver by the Company) of the following further conditions:

true and accurate as of such date or with respect to such period), except
where the failure of such representations and warranties to be so true and

 (a) _Expenses_. Except as otherwise specified in this Section 7.3 or agreed in writing by the parties, all fees, costs and expenses incurred in connection with this Agreement and the transactions contemplated by this Agreement shall be paid by the party incurring such fees, cost or expense whether or not the Merger is consummated.

 (ii) by Parent or the Company pursuant to Section 7.1(b)(iii), and (A) at or prior to the time this Agreement is terminable by either party pursuant to Section 7.1(b)(iii), a Competing Transaction involving the Company shall have been commenced, publicly disclosed or communicated to the Board of Directors (or any authorized committee thereof) of the Company and not abandoned and (B) within twelve (12) months of any such termination, the Company or any of its affiliates either becomes a party to any definitive agreement, letter of intent or agreement in principle in respect of a Competing Transaction or consummates a transaction that would constitute a Competing Transaction (which need not be the same Competing Transaction as the Competing Transaction described in clause (A)), then the Company shall pay to Parent the Company Termination Fee, in cash by wire transfer in immediately available funds to an account designated by Parent, on the same day as the execution of a definitive agreement, letter of intent or agreement in principle or consummation as applicable with respect to the referenced Competing Transaction;    

 (iii) by Parent pursuant to Section 7.1(d)(i), and (A) at or prior to the time this Agreement is terminable by either party pursuant to Section 7.1(b)(iii), a     #####

Upon such determination that any term or other provision is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced, the parties hereto shall negotiate in good faith to modify this Agreement so as to effect the original intent of the parties as closely as possible in a mutually acceptable manner in order that the transactions contemplated hereby may be consummated as originally contemplated to the fullest extent possible.     #####
