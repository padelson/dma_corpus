appropriate amendments to this Agreement related thereto; _provided, however_

" _Shares_ " or " _Company Common Stock_ ") issued and outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective Time (excluding any Excluded Shares but including
Shares described in _Section_ __ _ 2.3(b)_ and _Section_ __ _ 2.3(c)_) shall
be converted into 1.8656 shares of Buyer Common Stock (such ratio, the "
_Exchange Ratio_ ") which shares of Buyer Common Stock will be duly
authorized, fully paid, non-assessable and validly issued in accordance with
applicable Laws and the Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation of
the Buyer. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, all
Company Common Stock (if any) held in treasury or owned directly or indirectly
by the Company or any of its wholly-owned Subsidiaries or by the Buyer or any
of its wholly-owned Subsidiaries as of immediately prior to the Effective
Time, other than those held in a fiduciary capacity (" _Excluded Shares_ "),
will automatically be cancelled and no consideration will be paid or delivered
in exchange therefor.

 

(c) _Cancellation of Shares_. Shares of Company Common Stock, when
converted in accordance with  _Section_ __ _ 2.1(b)_, shall cease to be
outstanding and shall automatically be canceled and cease to exist, and each
holder of a Certificate or Book Entry Share shall cease to have any rights
with respect thereto, except the right to receive in respect of each share of
Company Common Stock previously represented thereby (i) the consideration set
forth in _Section_ __ _ 2.1(b)_, (ii) any dividends or other distributions in
accordance with  _Section_ __ _ 2.4(d)_, and (iii) any cash to be paid in
lieu of any fractional shares of Buyer Common Stock in accordance with
_Section_ __ _ 2.4(f)_, in each case without interest (collectively, the "
_Merger Consideration_ "), and in each case to be issued or paid in
consideration therefor upon the surrender of such Certificate or Book Entry
Share in accordance with _Section_ __ _ 2.4_.

 

2.2 _Dissenter_ __ _s Rights_.

 

In accordance with Section 262 of the DGCL, no appraisal rights shall be
available to holders of Company Common Stock or holders of Buyer Common Stock
in connection with the Merger.

2.3 _Treatment of Equity Awards_.

 

(a) As of immediately prior to the Effective Time, by virtue of the
occurrence of the Effective Time and without any action on the part of the
holder thereof, each Company RSU Award that is outstanding immediately prior
to the Effective Time shall be converted into an award (an "Assumed RSU
Award"), with respect to a number of shares of Buyer Common Stock equal to
the product obtained by multiplying (i) the applicable number of shares of
Company Common Stock subject to such Company RSU Award immediately prior to
the Effective Time by (ii) the Exchange Ratio. For each holder of a Company
RSU Award, any fractional shares resulting from the conversion of his or her
Company RSU Awards shall be rounded to the nearest whole share. Except as
otherwise provided in this Section 2.3(a), each Assumed RSU Award shall
continue to have, and shall be subject to, the same terms and conditions
(including time vesting conditions and, if applicable, any accelerated vesting
in connection with a termination of

 



4

    

 service) that applied to the underlying Company RSU Award immediately prior
to the Effective Time, except that Buyer (x) may modify terms rendered
inoperative by reason of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or
for such other immaterial administrative or ministerial changes as in the
reasonable and good faith determination of the Buyer are appropriate to
effectuate the administration of the Assumed RSU Award, and (y) except as
provided in _Section_ __ _ 2.3(d)_, may elect to settle the Assumed RSU Award
upon vesting in either Buyer Common Stock or cash (the amount of which shall
be equal to the fair market value of the Buyer Common Stock otherwise
deliverable in settlement of the Assumed RSU Award).

(b) The Company shall take all necessary and appropriate actions so that,
prior to the Effective Time, each then outstanding Company PSU Award shall be
terminated and vested in accordance with its terms with the number of shares
of Company Common Stock deliverable with respect to a Company PSU Award in
connection with such termination and vesting determined by the Compensation
Committee of the Company Board pursuant to the terms of the applicable Company
PSU Award, as such terms are in effect on the date hereof. The Company
(including the Company Board and any delegate thereof) shall not use
discretion to increase the amount of consideration payable with respect to any
Company PSU Award in connection with such termination and vesting, and, except
as provided in  _Section_ __ _ 2.3(d)_ the Buyer may elect to settle the
Company PSU Award in Buyer Common Stock (determined using the vesting
determination described above and converted into a number of shares of Buyer
Common Stock in the same manner described in Section 2.3(a)) or in cash (the
amount of which shall be equal to the fair market value of the Buyer Common
Stock otherwise deliverable in settlement of the Company PSU Award pursuant to
this  _Section_ __ _ 2.3(b)_ if the Buyer had instead elected to settle the
Company PSU Award in Buyer Common Stock). The Company shall provide the Buyer
with an opportunity to review and comment upon any determination of the
amount payable in respect of a Company PSU Award in connection with the
provisions of this Section 2.3(b), including calculations with respect to
total shareholder return, as applicable.

 

(c) The Company shall take all necessary and appropriate actions so that
prior to the Effective Time each Company Restricted Stock Award granted to a
Company non-employee director shall vest. Shares of Company Common Stock
attributable to such Company Restricted Awards shall be treated in the manner
set forth in  _Section_ __ _ 2.1(b)_ upon the Effective Time.

(d) All payments in settlement of (i) any Assumed RSU Awards that vest
immediately prior to or upon the occurrence of the Closing and (ii) the
Company PSU Awards pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 2.3(b)_ shall, in each case, be
made at or as soon as practicable following the Effective Time, but in no
event more than five (5) Business Days following the Effective Time, and shall
be subject to any applicable withholding; _provided, however,_ that to the
extent any payment in settlement of all or any portion of a Company PSU Award
or Assumed RSU Award cannot be paid during such period without causing the
recipient to incur a penalty tax under Section 409A of the Code, then such
payment shall be made solely in Buyer Common Stock and paid in
accordance with Section 409A of the Code and applicable guidance thereunder.

2.4 _Exchange of Company Common Stock_.

 

(a) _Exchange Agent_. Prior to the Effective Time, the Buyer shall
designate a bank, trust company or nationally recognized stockholder services
provider (the " _Exchange Agent_ ") for the purpose of exchanging, in
accordance with this _Article_ __ _ II_, Certificates and Book Entry Shares
for the Merger Consideration. Promptly after the Effective Time, the Buyer
shall deposit, or shall cause to be deposited, with the Exchange Agent, for
the benefit of the holders of shares of Company Common Stock, for exchange in
accordance with this _Article_ __ _ II_, through the Exchange Agent,
evidence of shares of Buyer Common Stock representing the aggregate amount of
shares of Buyer Common Stock sufficient to deliver the Merger Consideration.
The Buyer agrees to make available to the Exchange Agent, from time to time
as needed, cash sufficient to pay any dividends and other distributions
pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 2.4(d)_. Any cash and Buyer Common Stock deposited
with the Exchange Agent shall hereinafter be referred to as the " _Exchange
Fund_." The Exchange Agent shall, pursuant to irrevocable instructions,
deliver the Merger Consideration contemplated to be paid for shares of Company
Common Stock pursuant to this Agreement out of the Exchange Fund.
The Exchange Agent shall invest any cash included in the Exchange Fund as
directed by the Buyer, provided that no such investment or losses thereon
shall affect the amount of Merger Consideration payable to the holders of
shares of Company Common Stock. Any interest and other income resulting from
such investments shall be paid to the Buyer. Except as contemplated by this
Agreement, the Exchange Fund shall not be used for any other purpose.

 

(b) _Exchange Procedures_. Promptly after the Effective Time, the Buyer
shall instruct the Exchange Agent to mail to each record holder, as of the
Effective Time, of an outstanding certificate representing Company Common
Stock (a " _Certificate_ ") or a non-certificated share of Company Common
Stock (a " _Book Entry Share_ ") that immediately prior to the Effective Time
represented shares of Company Common Stock (i) a letter of transmittal (which
shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to
the shares of Company Common Stock shall pass, only upon proper delivery of
the corresponding Certificates to the Exchange Agent (or affidavits of loss in
lieu thereof together with any bond required pursuant to Section 2.4(c)) or
receipt by the Exchange Agent of an "agents message" with respect to Book
Entry Shares, and shall be in customary form as directed by the Buyer and
reasonably acceptable to the Company) and (ii) instructions for use in
effecting the surrender of the Certificates or Book Entry Shares in exchange
for the Merger Consideration payable in respect of the shares of Company
Common Stock represented thereby. Promptly after the Effective Time, upon
surrender of Certificates (or affidavits of loss in lieu thereof together
with any bond required pursuant to Section 2.4(c)) or Book Entry Shares for
cancellation to the Exchange Agent together with such letters of transmittal,
properly completed and duly executed, and such other documents as may
reasonably be required pursuant to such instructions, the holders of such
Certificates or Book Entry Shares shall be entitled to receive in exchange
therefor, (A) shares of Buyer Common Stock representing, in the aggregate, the
whole number of shares of Buyer Common Stock that such holder has the right
to receive pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 2.1_ (after taking into account all
shares of Company Common Stock then held by such holder) and (B) a check in
the amount equal to the aggregate amount of dividends and other distributions
pursuant to

 



6

    

  _Section_ __ _ 2.4(d)_ and cash payable in lieu of any fractional shares
of Buyer Common Stock pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 2.4(f)_. No interest shall
be paid or accrued on any Merger Consideration. In the event of a transfer of
ownership of shares of Company Common Stock which is not registered in the
transfer records of the Company, the Merger Consideration payable in respect
of such shares of Company Common Stock may be paid to a transferee if the
Certificate representing such shares of Company Common Stock is presented to
the Exchange Agent, accompanied by all documents required to evidence and
effect such transfer and the Person requesting such exchange shall pay to the
Exchange Agent in advance any transfer or other Taxes required by reason of
the delivery of the Merger Consideration in any name other than that of the
registered holder of the Certificate surrendered, or shall establish to the
satisfaction of the Exchange Agent that such Taxes have been paid or are not
payable.

 

(c) _Lost, Stolen, or Destroyed Certificates_. If any Certificate shall
have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that
fact by the Person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed
and, if reasonably required by the Buyer, the posting by such Person of a bond
in such reasonable amount as the Buyer may direct as indemnity against any
claim that may be made against it with respect to such Certificate, the
Exchange Agent shall issue in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed
Certificate the Merger Consideration (including any cash to be paid in lieu
of any fractional shares of Buyer Common Stock) and dividends or other
distributions with respect to Buyer Common Stock payable in respect of the
shares of Company Common Stock formerly represented by such Certificate.

 

(d) _Distributions with Respect to Unexchanged Buyer Common Stock_. No
dividends or other distributions declared or made with respect to Buyer
Common Stock with a record date after the Effective Time shall be paid to the
holder of any unsurrendered Certificate or Book Entry Share with respect to
the Buyer Common Stock that such holder would be entitled to receive upon
surrender of such Certificate or Book Entry Share and no cash payment in lieu
of fractional shares of Buyer Common Stock shall be paid to any such holder
until such holder shall surrender such Certificate or Book Entry Share
in accordance with this _Section_ __ _ 2.4_. Subject to applicable Law,
following surrender of any such Certificate or Book Entry Share, there shall
be paid to such holder of Buyer Common Stock issuable in exchange therefor,
without interest, (i) promptly after the time of such surrender, the number
of shares of any Buyer Common Stock due pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 2.1_ and
cash payable in lieu of fractional shares of Buyer Common Stock to which
such holder is entitled pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 2.4(f)_ and the amount of
dividends or other distributions with a record date after the Effective Time
theretofore paid with respect to such holders whole shares of Buyer
Common Stock, and (ii) at the appropriate payment date, the amount of
dividends or other distributions with a record date after the Effective Time
but prior to such surrender and a payment date subsequent to such surrender
payable with respect to such holders whole shares of Buyer Common Stock.

(e) _No Further Rights in Company Common Shares_. The Merger
Consideration issued upon conversion of a share of Company Common Stock in
accordance with the terms hereof (including any cash paid pursuant to
_Section_ __ _ 2.4(d)_ or _Section_ __ _ 2.4(f)_) shall be deemed to have
been issued in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to such share of
Company Common Stock.

 



7

    

(f) _Fractional Shares_.

 

(i) No certificates or scrip or Buyer Common Stock representing fractional
shares of Buyer Common Stock or book entry credit of the same shall be issued
upon the conversion of shares of Company Common Stock pursuant to Section 2.1,
no dividend or other distribution, stock split or interest shall relate to any
such fractional share and such fractional share shall not entitle the owner
thereof to vote or to have any rights as a holder of any Buyer Common Stock.
Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, each holder of shares
of Company Common Stock exchanged in the Merger who would otherwise have been
entitled to receive a fraction of a share of Buyer Common Stock (after taking
into account all Certificates or Book Entry Shares delivered by such holder)
shall receive, in lieu thereof, a cash payment (without interest and rounded
to the nearest cent) representing such holders proportionate interest, if
any, in the proceeds from the sale by the Exchange Agent in one or more
transactions of shares of Buyer Common Stock equal to the excess of (x)
the aggregate number of shares of Buyer Common Stock to be delivered to the
Exchange Agent by Buyer pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 2.4_ over (y) the
aggregate number of whole shares of Buyer Common Stock to be distributed to
the holders of Certificates or Book-Entry Shares pursuant to this _Section_
__ _ 2.4_ (such excess being herein called the " _Excess Shares_ "). The
parties acknowledge that payment of the cash consideration in lieu of issuing
fractional shares was not separately bargained-for consideration but merely
represents a mechanical rounding off for purposes of simplifying the corporate
and accounting problems that would otherwise be caused by the issuance of
fractional shares of Buyer Common Stock. As soon as practicable after the
Effective Time, the Exchange Agent, as agent for the holders of the
Certificates and Book Entry Shares representing shares of Company
Common Stock, shall sell the Excess Shares at then prevailing prices on the
NYSE in the manner provided in the following paragraph.

 

(ii) The sale of the Excess Shares by the Exchange Agent, as agent for the
holders that would otherwise receive fractional shares, shall be executed on
the NYSE through one or more member firms of the NYSE and shall be executed in
round lots to the extent practicable. Until the proceeds of such sale or sales
have been distributed to the holders of shares of Company Common Stock, the
Exchange Agent shall hold such proceeds in trust for the holders of shares of
Company Common Stock (the " _Common Shares Trust_ "). The Exchange Agent shall
determine the portion of the Common Shares Trust to which each holder of
shares of Company Common Stock shall be entitled, if any, by multiplying the
amount of the aggregate proceeds comprising the Common Shares Trust by a
fraction, the numerator of which is the amount of the fractional share
interest to which such holder of shares of Company Common Stock would
otherwise be entitled and the denominator of which is the aggregate amount of
fractional share interests to which all holders of shares of Company Common
Stock would otherwise be entitled.

 



8

    

(iii) As soon as practicable after the determination of the amount of
cash, if any, to be paid to holders of shares of Company Common Stock in lieu
of any fractional shares of Buyer Common Stock, the Exchange Agent shall make
available such amounts to such holders of shares of Company Common
Stock without interest, subject to and in accordance with this _Section_ __ _
2.4_.

(g) _Termination of Exchange Fund_. Any portion of the Exchange Fund that
remains undistributed to the holders of Company Common Stock after 180 days
following the Effective Time shall be delivered to the Buyer upon demand and,
from and after such delivery to the Buyer, any former holders of Company
Common Stock who have not theretofore complied with this _Article_ __ _ II_
shall thereafter look only to the Buyer for the Merger Consideration payable
in respect of such shares of Company Common Stock. Any amounts remaining
unclaimed by holders of shares of Company Common Stock immediately prior to
such time as such amounts would otherwise escheat to or become the property of
any Governmental Entity shall, to the extent permitted by applicable Law,
become the property of the Buyer free and clear of any Liens, claims or
interest of any Person previously entitled thereto.

 

(h) _No Liability_. None of the Buyer, the Company, the Exchange Agent or
any other Person shall be liable to any holder of shares of Company Common
Stock for any shares of Buyer Common Stock (or dividends or distributions with
respect thereto) or cash from the Exchange Fund delivered to a public official
or Governmental Entity pursuant to any abandoned property, escheat or similar
Law.

(i) _Withholding_. The Buyer, the Exchange Agent and any other
applicable withholding agent (as applicable) shall be entitled to deduct and
withhold from any consideration or other amounts payable or otherwise
deliverable pursuant to this Agreement to any Person such amounts as may be
required to be deducted or withheld under the Code, Treasury Regulations or
any provision of state, local, or foreign Tax Law, with respect to the making
of such payment. To the extent that amounts are so deducted or withheld, such
amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been
paid or otherwise delivered to the Person to whom such amounts would otherwise
have been paid or delivered.

 

(j) _Book Entry_. All shares of Buyer Common Stock to be issued in the
Merger shall be issued in book entry form, without physical certificates.

2.5 _Stock Transfer Books_.

 

At the close of business on the date on which the Effective Time occurs, the
stock transfer books of the Company shall be closed and thereafter there
shall be no further registration of transfers of shares of Company Common
Stock theretofore outstanding on the records of the Company. From and after
the close of business on the date on which

  



9

    

 the Effective Time occurs, any Certificates or Book Entry Shares presented
to the Exchange Agent or the Buyer for any reason shall represent only the
right to receive the Merger Consideration payable in respect of the shares of
Company Common Stock represented thereby in accordance with the terms hereof.

 

2.6 _Certain Adjustments_.

 

If after the date of this Agreement and at or prior to the Effective Time, the
outstanding shares of Buyer Common Stock or Company Common Stock are changed
into a different number of shares or type of securities by reason of any
reclassification, recapitalization, split-up, stock split, subdivision,
combination or exchange of shares, or any dividend payable in stock or other
securities is declared thereon or rights issued in respect thereof with a
record date within such period, or any similar event occurs (any such action,
an " _Adjustment Event_ "), the Merger Consideration will be adjusted
accordingly to provide to the holders of Company Common Stock and Company
Equity Awards the same economic effect as contemplated by this Agreement prior
to such Adjustment Event; _provided, however_ , that nothing in this 
_Section_ __ _ 2.6_ shall be deemed to permit or authorize any party hereto
to affect any such change that it is otherwise prohibited by this Agreement,
including _Sections 5.1_ and _5.2_.

good standing, to the extent such jurisdiction recognizes such concept), and
has all requisite corporate or other organizational power and authority
required to own, lease or otherwise hold, use and operate its properties,
rights and other assets and to carry on its business as it is now being
conducted, except in the case of any Subsidiary of the Company, where the
failure of such Subsidiary to be so organized, formed, existing or in good

a Material Adverse Effect on the Company.

(b) The Company and each of its Subsidiaries is duly qualified or licensed
to do business and in good standing to do business as a foreign corporation,
limited partnership or limited liability company, as the case may be, in each
jurisdiction in which the conduct or nature of its business or the ownership,
leasing, holding or operating of its properties makes such licensing or
qualification necessary (in the case of good standing, to the extent such
jurisdiction recognizes such concept), except for such jurisdictions where the
failure to be so qualified, licensed or in good standing, individually or in
the aggregate, has not had and would not be reasonably likely to have or

Letter, the respective certificates or articles of incorporation and bylaws or
other formation documents of the Subsidiaries of the Company do not contain
any provision limiting or otherwise restricting the ability of the Company to
control its Subsidiaries in any material respect.

 

3.2 _Capitalization_.

 

(a) The authorized Capital Stock of the Company consists of (i)
1,000,000,000 shares of Company Common Stock and (ii) 50,000,000 shares of

deliver and perform its obligations under this Agreement and to consummate
the

 



13

    

 transactions contemplated hereby, subject, with respect to the consummation
of the Merger, to receipt of the Company Required Vote. The execution,
delivery and performance by the Company of this Agreement and the
consummation by the Company of the transactions contemplated hereby have been
duly authorized by the Company Board. The Company Board has directed that this
Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby be submitted to
the Companys stockholders for adoption at a meeting of such stockholders
and, except, with respect to the consummation of the Merger, for the Company

necessary to authorize the execution, delivery and performance of this
Agreement by the Company and the consummation of the transactions contemplated
hereby. This Agreement has been duly executed and delivered by the Company
and, assuming due authorization, execution and delivery of this Agreement by
the Buyer, is a valid and binding obligation of the Company enforceable

 regarding the reliability of financial reporting, including policies and

detail accurately and fairly reflect the material transactions and
dispositions of the assets of the Company and its Subsidiaries, (b) provide

timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the
assets of the Company and its Subsidiaries; such disclosure controls and
procedures are designed to ensure that material information relating to the
Company, including its Subsidiaries, required to be disclosed by the Company
in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is accumulated
and communicated to the Companys principal executive officer and its
principal financial officer to allow timely decisions regarding required
disclosure; such disclosure controls and procedures are designed to ensure
that material information relating to the Company, including its consolidated

allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure; and such disclosure

controls and (y) any fraud, whether or not material, that involves management
or other employees who have a significant role in the Companys internal

5.3 _Acquisition Proposals_.

 

(a) The Company agrees that, except as expressly permitted in this _Section
5.3_, neither it nor any of its Subsidiaries shall, and the Company shall,
and shall cause its Subsidiaries to, instruct their respective officers,
directors, employees, investment bankers, attorneys, accountants, financial
advisors, affiliates, agents and other representatives (the "
_Representatives_ ") not to, directly or indirectly, (v) initiate, solicit,
knowingly encourage or knowingly facilitate (including by way of furnishing
non-public information), or take any other action designed to lead to, any
inquiries or the making or submission of any proposal that constitutes, or
would reasonably be expected to lead to, an Acquisition Proposal, (w)
participate or engage in discussions or negotiations with, or disclose any
non-public information or data relating to the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries or afford access to the properties, books or records of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries to any Person that has made an Acquisition
Proposal or any inquiry or proposal that would reasonably be expected to lead
to an Acquisition Proposal, (x) accept an Acquisition Proposal or enter into
any agreement (other than an Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement in
circumstances contemplated in this Section 5.3), including any letter of
intent or agreement in principle, providing for or relating to an Acquisition
Proposal or enter into any agreement, including any letter of intent or
agreement in principle, that would require, or would have the effect of
causing, the Company to abandon, terminate or fail to consummate the Merger or
the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement, (y) amend or grant
any waiver, release or modification under, or fail to enforce, any standstill
or similar agreement with respect to any class of equity securities of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries, or (z) resolve to do any of the foregoing.
Without limiting the foregoing, it is agreed that any action taken by any of
the Companys Subsidiaries or by any Representatives of the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries that, if taken by the Company, would constitute a breach of
this  _Section 5.3_ shall constitute a breach of this _Section 5.3_ by the
Company, regardless of (x) whether such Representative is authorized to take
such action, (y) whether such Representative is purporting to act on behalf
of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or otherwise, and (z) any contrary
instruction given to such Representative by the Company or any of its other
Representatives pursuant to this Section 5.3 or otherwise.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, the Company and
the Company Board may take any actions described in _clause (w)_ of this
_Section 5.3_ with respect to a third party if at any time prior to obtaining
the Company Required Vote (A) the Company receives a written Acquisition
Proposal from such third party that the Company Board believes in good faith
is bona fide, (B) the Company Board determines in good faith, after
consultation with its financial advisors and outside legal counsel, that such
proposal constitutes, or is reasonably likely to result in, a Superior
Proposal, and (C) the Company Board determines in good faith, after
consultation with its outside counsel, that the failure to participate in
such negotiations or discussions or to furnish such information or data to
such third party would reasonably be expected to be inconsistent with the
Company Boards fiduciary duties under applicable Law, provided that (1) such
Acquisition Proposal was received after the date of this Agreement, such
Acquisition Proposal was not the result of a material violation of this
_Section 5.3_ and such Acquisition Proposal has not been withdrawn, (2)
the Company provides to the Buyer the notice required by _Section 5.3(e)_
with respect to such Acquisition Proposal, (3) prior to or substantially

 



59

    

 concurrently with providing or making available to such other Person any
non-public information about the Company and its Subsidiaries that was
not previously provided or made available to the Buyer, the Company will
provide such non-public information to the Buyer, and (4) the Company shall
not deliver any information to such third party without entering into a
confidentiality agreement (an " _Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement_ ") on
terms, as they relate to confidentiality, no less favorable to the Company
than the Confidentiality Agreement (provided that such
Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement need not contain any "standstill" or
similar provision that would prohibit such third party from making any
Acquisition Proposal), a copy of which shall be promptly provided to the
Buyer. Nothing contained in this  _Section 5.3_ shall prohibit the Company
or the Company Board from taking and disclosing to the Companys stockholders
a position with respect to an Acquisition Proposal pursuant to Rule 14d-9 and
14e-2(a) promulgated under the Exchange Act or from making any similar
disclosure, in either case to the extent required by applicable Law;
_provided, however_ , that any such disclosure that addresses or relates to
the approval, recommendation or declaration of advisability by the Company
Board with respect to this Agreement or an Acquisition Proposal shall be
deemed to be an Adverse Recommendation Change unless the Company Board in
connection with such communication publicly states that its recommendation
with respect to this Agreement has not changed or refers to the prior
recommendation of the Company Board.

 

(b) Except as otherwise provided in _Section 5.3(c)_ or _Section 5.3(d)_,
neither the Company Board nor any committee thereof shall directly or
indirectly (i) (A) withhold, withdraw, modify, qualify or fail to make, or
publicly propose to withhold, withdraw, modify, qualify or fail to make, in
any manner adverse to the Buyer, the approval, recommendation or declaration
of advisability by the Company Board or any such committee thereof of this
Agreement, the Merger or the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, or (B) recommend, adopt or approve, or propose publicly
to recommend, adopt or approve, any Acquisition Proposal (any action
described in this clause (i) being referred to as an " _Adverse Recommendation
Change_ "), (ii) approve or recommend, or publicly propose to approve or
recommend, or allow the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to execute or
enter into, any agreement, including any letter of intent, memorandum of
understanding, agreement in principle, merger agreement, acquisition
agreement, option agreement, joint venture agreement, partnership agreement
or other similar agreement, arrangement or understanding, (A) constituting or
related to, or that is intended to or could reasonably be expected to lead to,
any Acquisition Proposal (other than an Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement
permitted pursuant to _Section 5.3(a)_) (each an " _Acquisition Agreement_ ")
or (B) requiring it to abandon, terminate or fail to consummate the Merger or
any other transaction contemplated by this Agreement, or (iii) resolve,
propose, agree or publicly announce an intention to do any of the foregoing.
For the avoidance of doubt, a public statement that merely describes the
Companys receipt of an Acquisition Proposal and the operation of this
Agreement with respect thereto shall not be deemed an Adverse Recommendation
Change.

(c) If the Company receives an Acquisition Proposal that was not the
result of a material violation of Section 5.3(a), and that the Company Board
believes in

 



60

    

 good faith is bona fide, and the Company Board (x) after consultation with
its financial advisors and outside legal counsel, concludes that such
Acquisition Proposal constitutes a Superior Proposal and (y) following
consultation with outside legal counsel, determines that the failure of the
Company Board to make an Adverse Recommendation Change or terminate this
Agreement pursuant to Section 7.1(d) would reasonably be expected to be
inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under applicable Law, then the Company
Board may at any time prior to obtaining the Company Required Vote, effect an
Adverse Recommendation Change or terminate this Agreement pursuant to 
_Section 7.1(d)_ ; _provided, however_ , that the Company Board may not take
such action pursuant to the foregoing unless:

 

(i) the Company has provided prior notice (which notice must state that the
Company Board has made the determinations described in, and in accordance
with, the foregoing _clauses (x)_ and _(y)_ of _Section 5.3(c)_ ) to the
Buyer specifying in reasonable detail the reasons for such action (including a
description of the material terms of such Superior Proposal, identifying the
Person or group making such Superior Proposal and delivering to the Buyer a
copy of the proposed definitive agreement providing for such Superior Proposal
in the form to be entered into and any other relevant proposed transaction
agreements) at least four (4) calendar days in advance of its intention to
take such action with respect to an Adverse Recommendation Change or terminate
this Agreement pursuant to  _Section 7.1(d)_ (the period inclusive of all
such days, the " _Section 5.3(c) Notice Period_ ") (it being understood and
agreed that any material amendment to the terms of a Superior Proposal shall
require a new notice pursuant to this _Section 5.3(c)_ and a new _Section
5.3(c)_ Notice Period, except that such new _Section 5.3(c)_ Notice Period in
connection with any amendment shall be for two (2) calendar days from the time
the Buyer receives such notice (as opposed to four (4) calendar days));

(ii) during the  _Section 5.3(c)_ Notice Period, the Company has
negotiated with the Buyer in good faith (to the extent the Buyer desires to
negotiate) to make such adjustments to the terms and conditions of this
Agreement as would obviate the need for the Company Board to make an Adverse
Recommendation Change pursuant to this _Section 5.3(c)_ or terminate this
Agreement pursuant to _Section 7.1(d)_ ; and

 

(iii) at the end of the _Section 5.3(c)_ Notice Period, the Company Board
again concludes in good faith, after consultation with its financial advisors
and outside legal counsel, and taking into account any adjustment or
modification to the terms and conditions of this Agreement proposed by the
Buyer, that such Acquisition Proposal continues to constitute a Superior
Proposal and that the failure of the Company Board to effect an Adverse
Recommendation Change or terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 7.1(d)
with respect to such Superior Proposal would reasonably be expected to be
inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under applicable Law.

 



61

    

(d) Other than in connection with an Acquisition Proposal (which shall be
subject to _Section 5.3(c)_ and shall not be subject to this _Section 5.3(d)_
), nothing in this Agreement shall prohibit or restrict the Company Board from
making an Adverse Recommendation Change at any time prior to obtaining the
Company Required Vote in response to a Company Intervening Event to the extent
that (i) the Company Board determines in good faith, after consultation with
the Companys outside legal counsel, that the failure of the Company Board to
effect an Adverse Recommendation Change would reasonably be expected to be
inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under applicable Law, and (ii) (A) the
Company provides the Buyer four (4) calendar days notice of its intention to
take such action, which notice shall specify the reasons therefor, (B) after
providing such notice and prior to making such Adverse Recommendation Change,
the Company shall negotiate in good faith with the Buyer during such four (4)
calendar day period (to the extent that the Buyer desires to negotiate) to
make such revisions to the terms of this Agreement as would obviate the need
for the Company Board to make an Adverse Recommendation Change pursuant to
this  _Section 5.3(d)_, and (C) the Company Board shall have considered in
good faith any changes to this Agreement offered in writing by the Buyer, and
following such four (4) calendar day period, shall have determined in good
faith, after consultation with its outside legal counsel and financial
advisors, that the failure of the Company Board to effect an Adverse
Recommendation Change with respect to such Company Intervening Event would
reasonably be expected to be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under
applicable Law. " _Company Intervening Event_ " means any material event,
development, circumstance, occurrence or change in circumstances or facts
(including any change in probability or magnitude of circumstances) not
related to an Acquisition Proposal that was not known or reasonably
foreseeable to the Company Board on the date hereof (or if known, the
magnitude or material consequences of which were not known or reasonably
foreseeable to or understood by the Company Board as of the date hereof),
which event, fact, circumstance, development or occurrence becomes known to or
by the Company Board prior to obtaining the Company Required Vote.

 

(e) The Company agrees that in addition to the obligations of the Company
set forth in  _paragraphs 5.3_ through _(b)_ of this _Section 5.3_, as
promptly as practicable after receipt thereof (but in no event later than 24
hours after the Companys receipt thereof), the Company shall advise
the Buyer in writing of any request for information (other than a request for
information in the ordinary course of business and unrelated to an Acquisition
Proposal) or any Acquisition Proposal received from any Person, or any
inquiry, discussions or negotiations with respect to any Acquisition
Proposal, and the material terms and conditions of such request, Acquisition
Proposal, inquiry, discussions or negotiations, and the Company shall promptly
provide to the Buyer (i) copies of any written materials received by the
Company in connection with any of the foregoing, (ii) the identity of the
Person or group making any such request, Acquisition Proposal or inquiry or
with whom any discussions or negotiations are taking place, and (iii) any
non-public information concerning the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
provided to any other Person or group in connection with any Acquisition
Proposal which was not previously provided to the Buyer. The Company shall
keep the Buyer informed of the status of any Acquisition Proposal (including
any changes to the material terms and conditions thereof). The Company agrees
not to release any third 

 



62

    

 party from, or waive any provisions of, any confidentiality or standstill
agreement to which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is a party and will
use its reasonable best efforts to enforce any such agreement at the request
of or on behalf of the Buyer, including initiating and prosecuting litigation
seeking appropriate equitable relief (where available) and, to the extent
applicable, damages; _provided, that_ , notwithstanding any other provision
in this _Section 5.3_, prior to, but not after, the time the Company Required
Vote is obtained, if, in response to an unsolicited request from a third party
to waive any "standstill" or similar provision, the Company Board or a
committee thereof determines in good faith, after consultation with its
outside legal counsel that the failure to take such action would reasonably be
expected to be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under applicable
Law, the Company may waive any such "standstill" or similar provision solely
to the extent necessary to permit a third party to make an Acquisition
Proposal, on a confidential basis, to the Company Board or a committee thereof
and communicate such waiver to the applicable third party; _provided,
however_ , that the Company shall advise the Buyer at least two (2) calendar
days prior to taking such action.

 

(f) The Company will and will cause its Subsidiaries and will instruct its
and their respective Representatives to, immediately cease and cause to be
terminated any discussions or negotiations, if any, with any Person (other
than the Buyer and its Representatives) conducted on or prior to the date of
this Agreement with respect to any Acquisition Proposal (which, for this
purpose, need not have been an unsolicited proposal) and shall request that
each Person that executed a confidentiality agreement with the Company with
respect to any Acquisition Proposal and is in possession of confidential
information about the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, return or destroy
all such confidential information in accordance with the terms of the
confidentiality agreement with such Person.

 

(g) For purposes of this Agreement, " _Acquisition Proposal_ " shall mean
any bona fide proposal, whether or not in writing, for the (i) direct or
indirect acquisition or purchase of a business or assets that (in the
aggregate) constitutes 20% or more of the net revenues, net income or the
assets (based on the fair market value thereof) of the Company and its
Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, (ii) direct or indirect acquisition or
purchase of 20% or more of any class of or Capital Stock of or any partnership
or other equity interest in, the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
whose business (in the aggregate) constitutes 20% or more of the net
revenues, net income or assets of the Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a
whole, or (iii) merger, consolidation, restructuring, transfer of assets or
other business combination, sale of shares of Capital Stock, partnership or
other equity interest, tender offer, exchange offer, recapitalization, stock
repurchase program or other similar transaction or series of transactions that
if consummated would result in any Person or Persons beneficially owning 20%
or more of any class of Capital Stock of, or any partnership or other equity
interest in, the Company or any of its Subsidiaries whose business (in the
aggregate) constitutes 20% or more of the net revenues, net income or assets
of the Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, other than the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement. The term " _Superior Proposal_ "
shall mean any bona fide written Acquisition Proposal made after the date
hereof that was not the result of a material violation of this _Section 5.3_ ,
made by a third party to purchase all or substantially all of the assets or
all or

 



63

    

 substantially all of the outstanding equity securities of the Company
pursuant to a tender offer, exchange offer or merger (i) on terms which a
majority of the Company Board determines in good faith to be superior to the
Company and its stockholders (in their capacity as stockholders) as compared
to the transactions contemplated hereby and to any alternative transaction or
changes to the terms of this Agreement proposed by the Buyer pursuant to
_Section 5.3(c)_ (after consultation with its financial advisors, and taking
into account all financial, legal and regulatory terms and conditions of the
Acquisition Proposal and this Agreement, including any changes to the terms
of this Agreement offered by the Buyer in response to such Superior Proposal,
including any conditions to and expected timing of consummation, and any risks
of non-consummation, of such Acquisition Proposal and taking into account all
other legal, financial and regulatory aspects of such proposal) and (ii) which
the Company Board reasonably believes is likely to be consummated on its
terms.

 

5.4 _Access to Information and Properties_.

 

(a) Upon reasonable notice and subject to applicable Laws relating to the
exchange of information, each of the Company and the Buyer shall, and shall
cause each of its Subsidiaries to, afford to the authorized Representatives of
the other party reasonable access, during normal business hours during the
period prior to the earlier of the Effective Time and the termination of this
Agreement pursuant to _Section 7.1_, to all of its properties, contracts,
books, commitments, records, data and books and personnel and, during such
period, it shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries to, make available to the
other parties all information concerning its business, properties and
personnel as the other parties may reasonably request and a copy of each
report, schedule, registration statement and other document filed, published,
announced or received by it in connection with the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement during such period pursuant to the requirements of
applicable Laws (including pursuant to the HSR Act, the Securities Act, the
Exchange Act and the rules of any Governmental Entity thereunder), as
applicable (other than documents which are not permitted to be disclosed under
applicable Laws), including all information necessary to prepare the Proxy
Statement and the S-4. No party nor any of its Subsidiaries shall be required
to provide access to or to disclose information where such access or
disclosure would violate or prejudice the rights of its customers, jeopardize
any attorney-client privilege or contravene any Law or binding agreement
entered into prior to the date of this Agreement. If the restrictions of the
preceding sentence apply, the Company and the Buyer shall cooperate in seeking
to find a way to allow disclosure of such information (including by entering
into a joint-defense or similar agreement) to the extent doing so (1) would
not (in the good faith belief of the party being requested to disclose the
information (after consultation with counsel, which may be in-house counsel))
be reasonably likely to result in the violation of any such contract or Law or
be reasonably likely to cause such privilege to be undermined with respect to
such information or (2) could reasonably (in the good faith belief of the
party being requested to disclose the information (after consultation with
counsel, which may be in-house counsel)) be managed through the use of
customary "clean-room" arrangements pursuant to which nonemployee
Representatives of the other party shall be provided access to such
information; provided, further, that the party being requested to disclose the
information shall (x) notify the other parties that such disclosures are

 



64

    

 reasonably likely to violate its or its Subsidiaries obligations under any
such contract or Law or are reasonably likely to cause such privilege to be
undermined and (y) communicate to the other parties in reasonable detail the
facts giving rise to such notification and the subject matter of such
information (to the extent it is able to do so in accordance with this
_Section 5.4(a)_) and (z) in the case where such disclosures are reasonably
likely to violate its or its Subsidiaries obligations under any contract, use
reasonable commercial efforts to seek consent from the applicable third party
to any such contract with respect to the disclosures prohibited thereby (to
the extent not otherwise expressly prohibited by the terms of such contract).
Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, between the date of this
Agreement and the Closing Date, the Company shall use its reasonable
best efforts to cooperate with and assist the Buyer in connection with the
Buyers planning and implementation of the integration of the Companys IT,
accounting, land and other systems and databases with those of the Buyer. For
clarity, the informational obligations under this Section 5.4(a) shall not
apply to information regarding Acquisition Proposals pursuant to _Section
5.3_.

 

(b) Until the Effective Time, each party and its authorized
Representatives, including engineers, advisors and consultants, lenders and
financing sources, upon reasonable notice and in a manner that does not
unreasonably interfere with the business of the applicable party or any of its
Subsidiaries, may enter into and upon all or any portion of the real property
owned or leased by the other party in order to investigate and assess, as such
party reasonably deems necessary or appropriate, the environmental condition
of such real property and the other assets or the businesses of such other
party or any of its Subsidiaries (an " _Investigation_ "). An Investigation
may include a Phase I environmental site assessment, or similar investigation
and sampling or testing of air, soil, sediments, and/or ground or surface
waters at, on or under any real property. Each party hereto shall, and shall
cause each of its Subsidiaries to, cooperate with the other parties in
conducting any such Investigation, facilitating further testing or evaluation
as may be reasonably prudent with respect to matters identified in the
Investigation, allow any other party reasonable access to such partys and its
Subsidiaries respective businesses, real property and other assets, together
with full permission to conduct any such Investigation, and provide to any
other party all plans, soil or surface or ground water tests or reports, any
environmental investigation results, reports or assessments previously or
contemporaneously conducted or prepared by or on behalf of such party, its
Subsidiaries, or any of their predecessors that are in the possession of such
party or any of its Subsidiaries, and all information relating to
environmental matters regarding such partys and its Subsidiaries
respective businesses, real property and other assets that are in the
possession of such party or any of its Subsidiaries.

 

(c) The Buyer and the Company will hold any information contemplated under
_Section 5.4(a)_ and/or  _Section 5.4(b)_ in accordance with the provisions

obligations under the Confidentiality Agreement shall terminate on the earlier
of (i) the date provided therein in the event this Agreement is terminated
prior to such date or (ii) the Effective Time. The disclosing party shall not
be responsible to the requesting party for personal injuries sustained by the
requesting partys Representatives in connection

 



65

indemnified and held harmless by the requesting party for any losses suffered

5.5 _Further Action; Reasonable Best Efforts_.

 

(a) Upon the terms and subject to the conditions herein provided, each of
the parties hereto agrees to use (and to cause their respective Subsidiaries

and to do, or cause to be done, all things necessary, proper or advisable
under applicable Laws to consummate and make effective the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement as promptly as practicable, including (i) the
use of reasonable best efforts to satisfy the conditions precedent to the
obligations of any of the parties hereto, (ii) the obtaining of all necessary
actions or nonactions, waivers, consents and approvals from Governmental
Entities and the making of all necessary registrations and filings and the

obtaining of all necessary consents, approvals or waivers from third parties,
(iv) the defending of any lawsuits or other legal proceedings, whether
judicial or administrative, challenging this Agreement or the consummation of
the transactions contemplated hereby and (v) the execution and delivery of any
additional instruments reasonably necessary to consummate the transactions
contemplated hereby; _provided, however_ , that none of the Buyer, the
Company or any of their respective Subsidiaries shall be required to pay any
fees or make any other payments to any such Person in order to obtain any such
approval, consent, ratification, permission, waiver or authorization (other
than normal filing fees imposed by Law). Each of the parties hereto will
furnish to the other parties such necessary information and reasonable
assistance as such other parties may reasonably request in connection with
the foregoing and will provide the other parties with copies of all filings
made by such party with any Governmental Entity (except for such filings that
are publicly available on the SECs Electronic Data Gathering Analysis and
Retrieval System) or any other information supplied by such party to a
Governmental Entity in connection with this Agreement and the transactions
contemplated hereby, provided that neither party is obligated to share any
document submitted to or received from a Governmental Entity that reflects
the negotiations between the parties or the valuation of some or all of any
partys business or assets.

 



66

    

(b) Each of the Buyer and the Company shall use its reasonable
best efforts to resolve such objections, if any, as may be asserted with
respect to the transactions contemplated hereby under any applicable Law.
Without limiting the foregoing, the Company and the Buyer shall, (i) as soon
as practicable, and in any event within 10 Business Days, file Notification
and Report Forms under the HSR Act with the Federal Trade Commission (the "
_FTC_ ") and the Antitrust Division of the Department of Justice (the "
_Antitrust Division_ ") and shall use reasonable best efforts to respond as
promptly as practicable to all inquiries received from the FTC or the
Antitrust Division for additional information or documentation, (ii) use
reasonable best efforts to cooperate with each other in (A) determining
whether any filings are required to be made with, or consents, permits,
authorizations, waivers or approvals are required to be obtained from, any
third parties or other Governmental Entities in connection with the execution
and delivery of this Agreement and the consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby and (B) timely making all such filings and timely seeking
all such consents, permits, authorizations or approvals, including
substantial compliance with any "second request" for additional information or
documentary material under the HSR Act as promptly as reasonably practicable,
(iii) use reasonable best efforts to take, or to cause to be taken, all other
actions and to do, or to cause to be done, all other things necessary, proper
or advisable to consummate and make effective the Merger and the other
transactions contemplated hereby, to cause the expiration or termination of
the applicable waiting periods under the HSR Act as soon as practicable, and
to avoid or eliminate each and every impediment under any Law that may be
asserted by any Governmental Entity with respect to the Merger so as to enable
the Closing to occur as soon as reasonably possible (and in any event no
later than the Termination Date), (iv) subject to applicable legal limitations
and the instructions of any Governmental Entity, keep each other apprised of
the status of matters relating to the completion of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, including to the extent permitted by Law
promptly furnishing the other with true and complete copies of notices or
other communications sent or received by the Company or the Buyer, as the case
may be, or any of their Subsidiaries, to or from any third party and/or any
Governmental Entity with respect thereto, and permit the other to review in
advance and comment on any proposed communication by such party to any
supervisory or Governmental Entity and (v) give the other reasonable notice
of, and, to the extent permitted by such Governmental Entity, allow the other
to attend and participate at any meeting with any Governmental Entity in
respect of any filings, investigation or other inquiry or proceeding relating
thereto.

(c) The Company agrees to, and to cause (with respect to advisors and
accountants, use its commercially reasonable efforts to cause) its
Subsidiaries and its and their respective officers, employees, advisors and
accountants to, reasonably cooperate, during normal business hours and with
reasonable notice, with the Buyer and its affiliates in connection with the
arrangement of any financing to be consummated prior to or contemporaneously
with the Closing in respect of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, including participation in meetings, due diligence sessions,
responding to questions or reasonable information requests regarding the
preparation of offering memoranda, private placement memoranda, prospectuses
and similar documents, and obtaining comfort letters from the
Companys accountants, and obtaining legal opinions of local counsel for
guarantors of financings, in each case, as may be reasonably

 



67

    

 requested by the Buyer and at no out-of-pocket expense to the Company or its
Subsidiaries (or the Buyer shall reimburse the Company and its Subsidiaries
for such out-of-pocket expenses). No later than three (3) Business Days prior
to Closing, the Company shall obtain from the Agent, and deliver to the
Buyer, prior to the Closing Date, an executed payoff letter in connection with
the Company Credit Agreement, in customary form and substance, setting forth
(i) the amounts required to pay off the Company Credit Agreement in full on
the Closing Date, the indebtedness owing to each creditor under the Company
Credit Agreement (including the outstanding principal, accrued and unpaid
interest and prepayment and other penalties) and wire transfer information
for such payment; and (ii) upon payment of such amounts, a release of the
Company and its Subsidiaries, including the automatic release of any and all
Liens securing the Company Credit Agreement.

 

(d) In case at any time after the Effective Time any further action is
necessary or desirable to carry out the purposes of this Agreement, the
proper officers and/or directors of the Surviving Entity shall take or cause
to be taken all such necessary action.

 

(e) In furtherance and not in limitation of the covenants of the parties
contained in this  _Section_ __ _ 5.5_, if any administrative or judicial
action or proceeding, including any proceeding by a private party, is
instituted (or threatened to be instituted) challenging the Merger or any
other transaction contemplated by this Agreement, each of the Company and the
Buyer shall cooperate in all respects with each other and shall use their
respective reasonable best efforts to contest and resist any such action or
proceeding and to have vacated, lifted, reversed or overturned any decree,
judgment, injunction or other order, whether temporary, preliminary or
permanent, that is in effect and that prohibits, prevents or restricts
consummation of the Merger or any other transactions contemplated
hereby. Notwithstanding the foregoing or any other provision of this
Agreement, nothing in this _Section_ __ _ 5.5_ shall limit a partys right to
terminate this Agreement pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 7.1(b)(ii)_ so long as
such party has, prior to such termination, complied with its obligations under
this _Section_ __ _ 5.5_.

 

(f) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement,
(i) except as otherwise permitted in  _Section_ __ _ 5.1_, the Company shall
not, nor shall it permit any of its Subsidiaries to, without the prior written
consent of the Buyer, divest or hold separate or otherwise take or commit to
take any action that limits its freedom, or after the Merger, the freedom of
action of the Buyer or any of the Buyers affiliates with respect to, or its
ability to retain, the Company and its Subsidiaries or any of the respective
businesses, product lines or assets of the Buyer, the Company or any of their
respective Subsidiaries or affiliates, and (ii) neither the Buyer nor any of
its affiliates shall be required to divest or hold separate (or agree to
divest or hold separate) or otherwise take or commit to take any action that
limits in any material respect its freedom of action with respect to, or its
ability to retain, any businesses, product lines or assets of the Buyer, the
Company or any of their respective Subsidiaries or affiliates. In addition,
neither the Buyer nor any of its affiliates shall be under any obligation to
take any action described in the preceding clause (ii) under this _Section_ __
_ 5.5_ if the FTC or the Department of Justice authorizes its staff to seek
a preliminary injunction or restraining order to enjoin consummation of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement or if any Governmental Entity
outside of the United States seeks comparable relief under any Competition
Laws. 

 



68

    

(g) The Company shall give the Buyer the opportunity to
participate, subject to a customary joint defense agreement, in, the defense
or settlement of any stockholder litigation against the Company or its
directors or officers relating to the Merger or any other transactions
contemplated hereby; provided, however _,_ that no such settlement shall be
agreed to without the Buyers consent.

(h) Subject to the receipt of any required consents under the Company
Credit Agreement, which the Company shall use its commercially reasonable
efforts to obtain (provided that such efforts shall not be required to include
payment of any fee, the payment of reimbursement of any legal or other
expense, or the payment of any other amount in connection with such consents,
all of which shall be paid by Buyer), the Company shall, at Buyers request,
(i) within the timeframes specified in the Indenture, provide all required
notices and documentation to the trustee under the Indenture (the " _Trustee_
") with respect to the redemption of all of the 8.875% Senior Notes due 2023
issued and outstanding under the Indenture (the " _2023 Notes_ "), (ii) when
requested by Buyer, send or instruct the Trustee to send to the holders of the
2023 Notes a notice of optional redemption (the " _Redemption Notice_ ") for
all of the outstanding principal amount of the 2023 Notes, and (iii) assuming
that prior to or contemporaneously with the Effective Time on the Closing
Date, the Buyer has deposited or caused to be irrevocably deposited with the
Trustee as trust funds in trust solely for the benefit of the holders of the
2023 Notes the aggregate amount of cash sufficient without consideration of
any reinvestment of interest to pay and discharge the entire Indebtedness (as
defined in the Indenture) on the 2023 Notes not theretofore delivered to the
Trustee for cancellation for principal, premium, if any, and accrued interest
to the date of redemption, together with all sums then payable by the Company
under the Indenture and the 2023 Notes, concurrently with Closing,
deliver irrevocable instructions to the Trustee to apply the deposited money
towards the payment of the 2023 Notes. The Redemption Notice shall be in form
and substance reasonably acceptable to the Buyer and shall provide that the
"Redemption Date" (as defined in the Indenture) shall be the a date requested
by Buyer and may provide that the consummation of the Merger is a condition
precedent to the redemption; provided that the Company hereby agrees that the
Redemption Notice issued in accordance with this clause (h) shall not include
any other condition precedent to the redemption.

5.6  _Proxy Statement/Form S-4; Stockholders_ __ _Meeting_.

 

(a) As promptly as practicable after the execution of this Agreement, the
Company and the Buyer shall cooperate in preparing and the Company shall
cause to be filed with the SEC, in connection with the Merger, a proxy
statement in preliminary form (together with any amendments or supplements
thereto, the " _Proxy Statement_ ") and the Buyer shall promptly prepare and
file with the SEC the S-4, in which the Proxy Statement will be included as a
prospectus, and the parties shall file, if necessary, any other statement or
schedule relating to this Agreement and the transactions contemplated

 



69

    

 hereby. Each of the Company and the Buyer shall use their respective
reasonable best efforts to furnish the information required to be included by
the SEC in the Proxy Statement, the S-4 and any such statement or schedule.
Each of the Company and the Buyer shall use its reasonable best efforts to
have the S-4 declared effective under the Securities Act as promptly as
practicable after such filing, and the Company shall as promptly as
practicable thereafter mail the Proxy Statement to its stockholders. In
furtherance of the foregoing, the parties shall respond promptly to any
comments with respect to the Proxy Statement or the S-4 filed by them. No
filing of, or amendment or supplement to, or dissemination of the Proxy
Statement or the S-4 or any other statement or schedule or any other
materials used in connection with the Company Special Meeting that constitute
"proxy materials" or "solicitation materials" as those terms are used in Rules
14a-1 through 14a-17 under the Exchange Act will be made by the Company or
the Buyer without providing the other a reasonable opportunity to review and
comment thereon. If at any time after the date the Proxy Statement is mailed
to the Companys stockholders and prior to the Company Special Meeting any
information relating to the Company, the Buyer or any of their respective
affiliates, officers or directors, should be discovered by the Company or the
Buyer which is required to be set forth in an amendment or supplement to the
Proxy Statement, S-4 or any other statement or schedule, so that none of the
Proxy Statement, the S-4 or any such statement or schedule will include any
untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact
necessary to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under
which they were made, not misleading, the party which discovers such
information shall promptly notify the other parties and an appropriate
amendment or supplement describing such information shall be promptly filed
with the SEC and, to the extent required by Law, disseminated to the
stockholders of the Company. The Buyer shall also use reasonable best efforts
to obtain all necessary state securities Law or "Blue Sky" permits and
approvals required to carry out the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement.

(b) All documents that the Company or the Buyer is responsible for filing
with the SEC in connection with the transactions contemplated herein will
comply as to form in all material respects with applicable requirements of the
Securities Act and the Exchange Act. The parties shall notify each other
promptly of the time when the S-4 has become effective, of the issuance of any
stop order or suspension of the qualification of the Buyer Common Stock
issuable in connection with the Merger for offering or sale in any
jurisdiction, or of the receipt of any comments from the SEC or the staff of
the SEC and of any request by the SEC or the staff of the SEC for amendments
or supplements to the Proxy Statement or the S-4 or for additional
information and shall supply each other with copies of (i) all correspondence
between it or any of its Representatives, on the one hand, and the SEC or the
staff of the SEC, on the other hand, with respect to the Proxy Statement, the
S-4 or the Merger and (ii) all orders of the SEC relating to the S-4.

 

(c) The Company, acting through the Company Board, shall, in accordance
with its certificate of incorporation and bylaws and with applicable Law,
promptly and duly call, give notice of, convene and hold, as soon as
practicable following the date upon which the S-4 is declared effective by the
SEC, and in no event later than 40 days after such date, a special meeting of
its stockholders for the sole purpose of

 



70

    

 considering and taking action upon this Agreement (the " _Company Special
Meeting_ "), and shall, except as otherwise provided in _Section_ __ _
5.3(c)_ or  _Section_ __ _ 5.3(d)_, _(i)_ recommend adoption of this
Agreement, and include in the Proxy Statement such recommendation and (ii) use
its reasonable efforts to solicit and obtain such adoption or
approval. Notwithstanding any withdrawal, amendment or modification by the
Company Board or any committee thereof of its recommendation of this Agreement
in accordance with _Section_ __ _ 5.3(c)_ or _Section_ __ _ 5.3(d)_, or the
commencement, public proposal, public disclosure or communication to the
Company of any Acquisition Proposal, or any other fact or circumstance, unless
this Agreement is terminated in accordance with _Section_ __ _ 7.1_, this
Agreement shall be submitted to the stockholders of the Company at the Company
Special Meeting for the purpose of adopting this Agreement. Once the Company
Special Meeting has been called and noticed, the Company shall not postpone or
adjourn the Company Special Meeting without the consent of the Buyer (which
consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed) (other than (i) for the
absence of a quorum, or (ii) to allow reasonable additional time for the
filing and mailing of any supplemental or amended disclosure which the
Company Board has determined in good faith after consultation with outside
counsel is necessary under applicable Law and for such supplemental or amended
disclosure to be disseminated and reviewed by the Companys stockholders
prior to the Company Special Meeting). At any such Company Special Meeting
following any such withdrawal, amendment or modification of the Company
Boards recommendation of this Agreement, the Company shall submit this
Agreement to its stockholders and, provided the Company Board has complied
with _Section_ __ _ 5.3(c)_ or _Section_ __ _ 5.3(d)_, may do so without a
recommendation or with a negative recommendation (although the approval of
this Agreement by the Company Board may not be rescinded or amended), in which
event the Company Board may, subject to _Section_ __ _ 5.3(c)_ or _Section_
__ _ 5.3(d)_, communicate the basis for its lack of a recommendation or
negative recommendation to its stockholders in the Proxy Statement or an
appropriate amendment or supplement thereto. Without limiting the generality
of the foregoing, the Company agrees that unless this Agreement is validly
terminated in accordance with _Section_ __ _ 7.1_, the Company shall not
submit any Acquisition Proposal (including any Superior Proposal) to a vote of
Companys stockholders.

 

5.7 _Notification of Certain Matters_.

 

The Company shall give prompt notice to the Buyer, and the Buyer shall give
prompt notice to the Company, of (a) any notice or other communication
received by such party from any Governmental Entity in connection with the
transactions contemplated hereby or from any Person alleging that the consent
of such Person is or may be required in connection with the
transactions contemplated hereby, if the subject matter of such communication
or the failure of such party to obtain such consent would reasonably be
expected to be material to the Company or the Buyer, (b) the discovery of any
fact or circumstance that, or the occurrence or non-occurrence of any event
the occurrence or non-occurrence of which, would result in the failure to be
satisfied of any of the conditions to be complied with or satisfied by it
under this Agreement, (c) any representation or warranty made by it contained
in this Agreement becoming untrue or inaccurate in any material respect
(including such party having received knowledge of any fact, event or
circumstance that would be reasonably expected to cause any

 



71

    

 representation qualified as to the knowledge of such party to be or become
untrue or inaccurate), (d) any actions, suits, claims, investigations or
proceedings commenced or threatened against, relating to or involving or
otherwise affecting such party or any of its Subsidiaries and that relate to
the Merger or (e) the failure by it to comply with or satisfy in any material
respect any covenant, condition or agreement to be complied with or satisfied
by it under this Agreement; _provided, however_ , that no such notification
shall affect the representations, warranties, covenants or agreements of the
parties or the conditions to the obligations of the parties under
this Agreement.

5.8 _Directors_ __ _and Officers_ __ _Insurance and Indemnification_.

(a) After the Effective Time, and subject to _Section_ __ _ 5.8(b)_,
the Buyer shall indemnify, defend and hold harmless the present and former
officers, directors, employees and agents of the Company and any of its
Subsidiaries in such capacities (" _Indemnified Parties_ ") to the fullest
extent permitted by applicable Law against any losses, claims, damages,
costs, fines, penalties, expenses (including attorneys and other
professionals fees and expenses), liabilities, judgments or amounts that are
paid in settlement of, or incurred in connection with, any Proceeding to
which an Indemnified Party is a party or is otherwise involved (including as a
witness) that is based in whole or in part on, or arising in whole or in part
out of, the fact that such Indemnified Party is or was a director, officer,
employee or agent of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, or a fiduciary
under any Company Plan (including, in each case, if such service was at the
request or for the benefit of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries as
a director, officer, employee, agent, trustee or partner of another
corporation, partnership, trust, joint venture, employee benefit plan or other
entity and including acts or omissions occurring in connection with this
Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby), arising out of actions
or omissions or alleged actions or omissions occurring or existing at, or
prior to the Effective Time and whether asserted or claimed at, prior to or
after the Effective Time.

 

(b) After the Effective Time, in the event any Indemnified Party becomes
involved in any capacity in any Proceeding based in whole or in part on, or
arising in whole or in part out of, any matter, including the transactions
contemplated hereby, existing or occurring at or prior to the Effective Time,
the Indemnified Parties may retain counsel reasonably satisfactory to them
after consultation with the Buyer; _provided, however_ , that (i) the Buyer
shall have the right to assume the defense thereof with counsel reasonably
satisfactory to the Indemnified Parties and upon such assumption the Buyer
shall not be liable to such Indemnified Party for any legal expenses of other
counsel or any other expenses subsequently incurred by such Indemnified Party
in connection with the defense thereof, except that if the Buyer elects not to
assume such defense or counsel for such Indemnified Party reasonably
determines (upon advice of outside counsel) that there are issues that raise
conflicts of interest between the Buyer and such Indemnified Party, or among
one or more Indemnified Parties, such Indemnified Party may retain counsel
reasonably satisfactory to him/her after consultation with the Buyer, and the
Buyer shall as promptly as practicable pay the reasonable fees and expenses of
such counsel for such Indemnified Party and (ii) the Buyer shall have no
obligation hereunder to any Indemnified Party when and if a court of competent

 



72

    

 jurisdiction shall ultimately determine, and such determination shall have
become final and nonappealable, that indemnification of such Indemnified Party
in the manner contemplated hereby is prohibited by applicable Law. Any
Indemnified Party wishing to claim indemnification under this _Section_ __ _
5.8_, upon learning of any such claim, action, suit, proceeding or
investigation, shall notify promptly the Buyer thereof, provided that the
failure to so notify shall not affect the obligations of the Buyer under this
_Section_ __ _ 5.8_ except to the extent such failure to notify prejudices
the Buyer. The Buyers obligations under this  _Section_ __ _ 5.8_ shall
continue in full force and effect for a period of six years from the Effective
Time; _provided, however_ , that all rights to indemnification in respect of
any claim (a " _Claim_ ") asserted or made within such period shall continue
until the final disposition of such Claim.

(c) No Indemnified Party shall settle any Claim without the prior written
consent of the Buyer, nor shall the Buyer settle any Claim without either (i)
the written consent of all Indemnified Parties against whom such Claim was
made (which consents shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or
delayed), or (ii) obtaining an unconditional general release from all
liability arising out of such Proceeding for all Indemnified Parties without
admission or finding of wrongdoing as a condition of such settlement. The
rights of each Indemnified Party under this _Section_ __ _ 5.8_ shall be in
addition to any rights such person may have under the certificate of
incorporation or by-laws of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, under
Delaware law or any other applicable Law or pursuant to any employment
agreement or indemnification agreement in effect on the date hereof. The
provisions of this _Section_ __ _ 5.8_ are intended for the benefit of, and
shall be enforceable by, the respective Indemnified Parties.

(d) The Buyer agrees that all rights to exculpation, indemnification and
advancement of expenses now existing in favor of the current or former
directors, officers or employees, as the case may be, of the Company or its
Subsidiaries as provided in their respective certificates of incorporation or
by-laws or other organizational documents or in any agreement to which the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries is a party, shall survive the Merger and
shall continue in full force and effect. For a period of six (6) years from
the Effective Time, the Buyer shall maintain in effect the exculpation,
indemnification and advancement of expenses provisions of the Companys and
any of its Subsidiarys certificate of incorporation and by-laws or similar
organizational documents in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time or
in any indemnification agreements of the Company or its Subsidiaries with
any of their respective directors, officers or employees in effect
immediately prior to the Effective Time, and shall not amend, repeal or
otherwise modify any such provisions in any manner that would adversely affect
the rights thereunder of any individuals who immediately before the Effective
Time were current or former directors, officers or employees of the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries; _provided_ , _however_ , that all rights to
indemnification in respect of any Proceeding pending or asserted within such
period shall continue until the disposition or resolution of such Proceeding.
If the Buyer or any of its successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or
merges into any other Person and shall not be the continuing or surviving
company or entity of such consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers or conveys
all or substantially all of its properties and assets to any Person, then, and
in each such case, to the extent required, proper provision shall be made so
that the successors and assigns of the Buyer shall assume the obligations set
forth in this _Section_ __ _ 5.8_.

 



73

    

(e) On or prior to the Effective Time, the Buyer shall purchase a "tail"
directors and officers liability insurance policy covering the six-year
period from and after the Effective Time for the Company and its current and
former directors and officers who are currently covered by the directors and
officers liability insurance coverage currently maintained by the Company
from a carrier with the same or better credit rating to the Companys current
directors and officers liability insurance carrier on terms not less
favorable to the insured persons than the directors and officers liability
insurance coverage currently maintained by the Company as of the date of this
Agreement with respect to claims arising from facts or events that occurred
on or before the Effective Time, except that in no event shall the Buyer pay
(or become obligated to pay) with respect to such "tail" policy more than the
amount set forth on Section 5.8(e) of the Buyer Disclosure Letter (the "
_Maximum Amount_ ") unless Buyer, in its sole discretion, elects to pay more
than the Maximum Amount for such purpose. If the cost of the insurance called
for by this  _Section_ __ _ 5.8(e)_ exceeds the Maximum Amount, and the
Buyer elects not to spend more than the Maximum Amount for such purpose, the
Buyer shall purchase as much coverage as is available for the Maximum Amount.

 

5.9 _Publicity_.

 

The Company and the Buyer agree to issue an initial joint press release
announcing the execution and delivery of this Agreement to be reasonably
agreed upon by the Buyer and the Company. Neither the Company, the Buyer, nor
any of their respective affiliates shall issue or cause the publication of any
public disclosure, press release, or other public announcement with respect
to the Merger, this Agreement or the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement without the prior written consent of the other party, which consent
shall not be unreasonably withheld, except as may be required by Law or by any
listing agreement with a national securities exchange if all reasonable
efforts have been made to consult with the other party and to afford such
other party an opportunity to first review the content of the proposed
disclosure and provide reasonable comment regarding the same; _provided_ ,
that each party or any of their respective affiliates may issue public
announcements or make other public disclosures regarding the Merger, this
Agreement or the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement that
consist solely of information previously disclosed in press releases or
announcements previously approved by either party or made by either party in
compliance with this _Section_ __ _ 5.9_; _provided_ , _further_ , that
neither party shall be (a) restricted from making internal communications with
its employees which are not made public; provided that such party shall
consult with the other party with respect to any such communication regarding
material developments with respect to the Merger (other than those described
in Section 5.3), or (b) required by any provision of this Agreement to consult
with or obtain any approval from any other party with respect to a public
announcement or press release issued in connection with the receipt and
existence of an Acquisition Proposal and matters related thereto or an Adverse
Recommendation Change other than as set forth in _Section_ __ _ 5.3_. For the
avoidance of doubt, nothing in this _Section_ __ _ 5.9_ shall prevent the
Buyer or the Company from issuing any press release or making any public
statement in the ordinary course that does not relate specifically to the
Merger, this Agreement or the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement.

 



74

    

5.10 _Comfort Letters; Consent to Use of Financial Statements_. 

(a) In connection with the information regarding the Company and its
Subsidiaries, or the Merger, provided by the Company and its Subsidiaries
specifically for inclusion in, or incorporation by reference into, the S-4,
the Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause to be delivered to
the Buyer a letter of Grant Thornton LLP, dated the date on which the S-4
shall become effective and addressed to the Buyer, in form and substance
reasonably satisfactory to the Buyer and customary in scope and substance
for letters delivered by independent public accountants in connection with
registration statements similar to the S-4.

 

(b) The Company hereby consents to the Buyers use of and reliance on any
audited or unaudited financial statements, including the financial statements
of the Company included in the Company SEC Documents, relating to the Company
and its Subsidiaries reasonably requested by the Buyer to be used in any
financing or other activities of the Buyer and its Subsidiaries, including
any filings that the Buyer and its Subsidiaries are required to make with the
SEC in connection therewith. In addition, the Company will use, and will cause
its Subsidiaries to use, their respective commercially reasonable efforts to
obtain comfort letters from Grant Thornton LLP regarding information about the
Company and its Subsidiaries as reasonably requested by the lead
underwriter(s) or initial purchaser(s) in connection with any registered or
private offering or otherwise and to obtain the consent of Grant Thornton LLP
to the inclusion of the financial statements referenced above in appropriate
filings with the SEC or in private placement documents.

 

5.11 _Stock Exchange Listing_.

 

The Buyer shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause the shares of Buyer
Common Stock to be issued in the Merger to be approved for listing on the
NYSE, subject to official notice of issuance, as of the Effective Time.

5.12 _Employee Matters_

 

(a) The Buyer shall provide (or cause its affiliates to provide), for
the one-year period following the Effective Time (or until such employees
earlier termination of employment for any reason), each employee who remains
in the active employment with the Surviving Entity or any of its affiliates
as of the Effective Time (the " _Continuing Employees_ "), (i) an annual base
salary or wage rate that is equal to or greater than his or her annual base
salary or wage rate as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time
(provided that such salary and wage rate shall be subject to reduction in the
event of generally applicable similar reductions in salaries and wages
applicable to similarly situated employees of the Buyer), (ii) an annual
bonus opportunity that is equal to or greater than his or her annual bonus
opportunity as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time, (iii)
recognition of all earned but unused paid time off (" _PTO_ ") of the 

 



75

    

 Continuing Employee as of the Effective Time and an annual PTO carryover
allowance into 2021 of up to 80 hours (or more as may be the policy of the
Buyer or its affiliates as in effect from time to time) of earned but unused
PTO, and (iv) other compensation and employee benefits (other than equity or
equity-based compensation) that are substantially similar in the aggregate to
either (A) the other compensation and employee benefits provided to similarly
situated employees of the Buyer and its affiliates as in effect from time to
time, or (B) the other compensation and employee benefits provided to
Continuing Employees immediately prior to the Effective Time (in each case
other than equity or equity-based compensation). Subject to _Section_ __ _
5.12(b)_, the event that any individual is terminated for any reason upon or
immediately following the Effective Time, (1) such individual will cease to
be a Continuing Employee for purposes of this Section 5.12 and (2) no such
individual shall be eligible for or entitled to benefits under any benefit or
compensation plan of Buyer or an Affiliate in effect prior to the Effective
Time. For purposes of the immediately preceding sentence, no Company Plan
shall be considered to be a benefit or compensation plan of Buyer or an
Affiliate in effect prior to the Effective Time.

 

(b) The Buyer shall (or shall cause its affiliates to) honor, pay, perform
and satisfy any and all liabilities, obligations and responsibilities to, or
in respect of, each current or former employee, consultant or director of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries arising under the terms of any employment,
consulting, retention, equity or equity-based, severance, change of control,
or similar plan, agreement or arrangement listed on Section 3.10(a) of the
Company Disclosure Letter in accordance with the terms thereof in effect at
the Effective Time. Further and without limiting the foregoing, the Buyer and
the Company hereby agree that the consummation of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement shall constitute a "change of control" or
"change in control" for purposes of each of (i) the employment agreements and
offer letters listed on _Section_ __ _ 3.10(d)(i)_ of the Company Disclosure
Letter, (ii) the Company Equity Plans and all Company RSU Awards, Company PSU
Awards, and Company Restricted Stock Awards outstanding under the Company
Equity Plans as of the Closing Date, and (iii) the other Company Plans listed
on _Section_ __ _ 3.10(d)(i)_ of the Company Disclosure Letter.

 

(c) Effective as of the Effective Time, the Buyer shall, or shall cause its
affiliates to, cause each Buyer Plan (including all applicable PTO, severance
and defined contribution retirement benefit plans and programs) in which any
Continuing Employee becomes eligible to participate to treat the prior service
of such Continuing Employee with any of the Company and its affiliates as
service rendered to the Buyer for purposes of vesting, eligibility and level
of benefits, but not for any purposes under any defined benefit pension plan
or retiree medical plan or for purposes of vesting under any
equity compensation plan, to the extent that such service crediting does not
violate any applicable Laws or result in duplication of benefits for the same
period of service.

 

(d) The Buyer shall, or shall cause its affiliates to, use commercially
reasonable efforts to (i) waive any limitation on health and welfare coverage
of any Continuing Employee and his or her eligible dependents due to pre-
existing conditions and/or waiting periods, active employment requirements,
and requirements to show evidence of good health under the applicable health
and welfare plan of the Buyer or any

 



76

    

 affiliate of the Buyer to the extent such Continuing Employee and his or her
eligible dependents are covered under a health and welfare benefit plan of the
Company or any of its affiliates (as the case may be), and such conditions,
periods or requirements are satisfied or waived under such plan, immediately
prior to the Effective Time and (ii) credit each Continuing Employee and his
or her eligible dependents with all deductible payments, co-payments and co-
insurance paid by such employee and covered dependents under the medical
employee benefit plan of the Company or any of its affiliates (as the case
may be) prior to the Effective Time during the year in which the Effective
Time occurs for the purpose of determining the extent to which any such
employee and his or her dependents have satisfied their deductible and whether
they have reached the out-of-pocket maximum under any medical plan of the
Buyer or any affiliate of the Buyer for such year.

 

(e) The provisions of this Section 5.12 are for the sole benefit of the
parties and nothing herein, expressed or implied, is intended or will be
construed to confer upon or give to any person (including, for the avoidance
of doubt, any Continuing Employee or other current or former employee of the
Company or any of their respective affiliates), other than the parties and
their respective permitted successors and assigns, any legal or equitable or
other rights or remedies (including with respect to the matters provided for
in this Section 5.12) under or by reason of any provision of this
Agreement. Nothing in this _Section_ __ _ 5.12_ is intended to (i) prevent
the Buyer, the Surviving Entity or any of their respective affiliates from (A)
establishing, amending or terminating any of their respective employee
benefit plans or any other benefit or compensation plan, policy, program,
contract, agreement or arrangement or, after the Effective Time, any Company
Plan or (B) terminating the employment or service of any Person, including a
Continuing Employee, at any time and for any reason, or (ii) provide any
Person any right to employment or service or continued employment or service
with the Buyer, the Surviving Entity or any of their respective affiliates.

 

(f) Nothing in this Agreement shall constitute an establishment or
termination of, or an amendment to, or be construed as establishing,
terminating or amending, any employee benefit plan sponsored, maintained or
contributed to by the Company, the Buyer or any of their respective
affiliates.

 

5.13 _Certain Tax Matters_.

 

(a) Subject to any changes to the method or structure of effecting the
Merger pursuant to Section 1.7, but subject to the qualifications therein,
for U.S. federal income tax purposes, (i) the parties intend that (x) the
Merger shall be treated as a transaction that qualifies as a "reorganization"
within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code, (y) the Company and the
Buyer shall each be a party to such reorganization within the meaning of
Section 368(b) of the Code and (ii) this Agreement is intended to be, and is
hereby adopted as, a "plan of reorganization" for purposes of Sections 354,
361 and 368 of the Code and within the meaning of Treasury Regulations Section
1.368-2(g). From and after the date of this Agreement and until the Closing
Date, each party hereto shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to cause
the Merger to so qualify, and will not knowingly take any action, cause any
action to be taken, fail to take any action or 

 



77

    

 cause any action not to be taken, which action or failure to act could
reasonably be expected to prevent the Merger from qualifying as a
"reorganization" within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code.

(b) The Buyer and the Company shall each use commercially reasonable
efforts to cause the delivery of any opinion with respect to the tax
treatment of the Merger required to be rendered in connection with any filing
described in _Section_ __ _ 5.6_, including using commercially reasonable
efforts to deliver to Norton Rose Fulbright US LLP, tax counsel for the
Company, and Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher and Flom LLP, tax counsel for the
Buyer, or in each case, such other nationally recognized law or accounting
firm reasonably acceptable to the Company or the Buyer, as applicable, Tax
certificates dated as of the date such filing is declared effective by the SEC
and signed by an officer of the Company or the Buyer, as applicable,
containing representations and covenants, in each case, as reasonably
necessary and appropriate to enable counsels to render any such opinion. Each
of the Buyer and the Company shall use its commercially reasonable efforts not
to take or cause to be taken any action that would cause to be untrue (or fail
to take or cause not to be taken any action which would cause to be untrue)
any of the Tax certifications, covenants, and representations included in the
certificates described in this _Section_ __ _ 5.13(b)_. The Company and
the Buyer shall reasonably cooperate in the preparation, execution and filing
of all Returns, questionnaires, applications or other documents regarding any
real property transfer or gains, sales, use, transfer, value added, stock
transfer and stamp taxes, and transfer, recording, registration and other
fees and similar Taxes which become payable in connection with the Merger that
are required or permitted to be filed on or before the Effective Time. Each of
the Buyer and the Company shall pay, without deduction from any consideration
or other amounts payable or otherwise deliverable pursuant to this Agreement
and without reimbursement from the other party, any such Taxes or fees imposed
on it by any Governmental Entity, which becomes payable in connection with
the Merger.

(c) The Company and the Buyer shall comply with the recordkeeping
and information reporting requirements imposed on them, including, if
applicable, but not limited to those set forth in Treasury Regulation Section
1.368-3.

 

5.14 _Confidentiality Agreement_.

 

The obligations of the Buyer and the Company under the Confidentiality
Agreement shall remain in full force and effect in accordance with its terms
and all information provided to any party or its Representatives pursuant to
or in connection with this Agreement is deemed to be "Confidential
Information" as defined under the Confidentiality Agreement; _provided,
however_ , that nothing in the Confidentiality Agreement shall be deemed to
restrict the performance by the Company, the Buyer or their respective
Subsidiaries of their respective obligations under this Agreement, and in the
case of any conflict between the terms of this Agreement and the terms of the
Confidentiality Agreement, the terms of this Agreement shall control.

 



78

    

5.15 _Takeover Laws_.

 

Neither the Company nor the Buyer will take any action that would cause the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement to be subject to requirements
imposed by any "fair price," "moratorium," "control share acquisition,"
"business combination" or other anti-takeover statute or similar statute
enacted under state or federal law, and each of them will take all reasonable
steps within its control to exempt (or ensure the continued exemption of) the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement from such Laws of any state that
purport to apply to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby.

5.16 _Section_ __ _ 16 Matters_.

 

The Company Board shall, to the extent necessary, take appropriate action,
prior to the Effective Time, to approve, for purposes of Section 16(b) of the

individuals and to cause such dispositions and/or cancellations to be exempt
under Rule 16b-3 promulgated under the Exchange Act.

 

5.17 _Transportation Agreements_.

 

The Buyer shall prepare and file with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission
("FERC") (and the Company shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries and their

Subsidiary of the Company holding capacity for temporary waivers of
all applicable capacity release regulations and related policies and
requirements of the related tariff requirements of the interstate pipelines
providing transportation service pursuant to transportation agreements as may
be reasonably necessary to facilitate the assignment or permanent release
from the Company, its Subsidiaries and their affiliates to SWN Energy Services
Company LLC or any other designated affiliate of the Buyer of all pipeline
transportation contracts subject to the jurisdiction of FERC on rates, terms
and conditions identical to those currently in effect for the Company, its
Subsidiaries and their affiliates or their designees to be effective on or
after the Closing.

Prior to Closing, the Company or its applicable Subsidiary shall in respect of
each Specified Hedging Volume identified on  _Section_ __ _ 3.21_ of the

initiate one or more swap or collar transactions, or a combination thereof, in
amounts equal to such Specified Hedging Volume in accordance with the terms
and timing set forth on _Section_ __ _ 3.21_ of the Company Disclosure
Letter, (B) maintain (without increasing or decreasing) each Specified Hedging
Volume, and (C) not execute or deliver any amendment for, or waiver of any
right under, any Derivative Transaction, transfer any right or obligation
under any Derivative Transaction or terminate any Derivative Transaction other

necessary in order to maintain the Specified Hedging Volumes identified on
Section 3.21 of the Company Disclosure Letter.

5.19 _WARN Act Compliance_.

 

The Company and its Subsidiaries shall refrain from causing any employees of
the Company or its subsidiaries to suffer an "employment loss" (as defined in
the WARN Act) in the ninety (90) days prior to the Effective Time; provided,
however, that any such "employment loss" resulting from actions taken by the
Company or its Subsidiaries with the consent or at the request of the Buyer
shall not constitute a breach of this covenant. At the request of the Buyer,
the Company or its Subsidiaries, as applicable, shall prepare and deliver any
notices required or potentially required pursuant to the WARN Act
to effectuate the termination of any employees of the Company or its
Subsidiaries identified by the Buyer as of the Effective Time; provided,
however, that all such notices shall indicate that the terminations shall be
contingent upon the consummation of the Merger.

At least 20 days prior to the expiration of any Oil and Gas Lease of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries that (i) is scheduled to expire prior to
the Closing Date and (ii) the Company or any of its Subsidiaries has the right
or option to renew or extend, whether through the payment of delay rentals or
otherwise, the Company shall (x) provide the Buyer with notice of such
expiration and (y) consult with the Buyer regarding any determination of the
Company to renew or otherwise extend, or to not renew or otherwise extend, the
term of such Oil and Gas Lease.

Time, whether before or after stockholder adoption of this Agreement:

(a) By the mutual consent of the Buyer and the Company in a written
instrument;

(b) By either the Company or the Buyer upon notice to the other, if:

(i) the Merger shall not have been consummated on or before 11:59 p.m.,

that the right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this _Section_ __ _
7.1(b)(i)_ shall not be available to a party whose failure to fulfill
any material obligation under this Agreement or other material breach of this
Agreement has been the cause of, or resulted in, the failure of the Merger to

 covenant or other agreement contained herein); _provided, however_ , that
neither party shall have the right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to

representation or warranty by the Company) or _Section_ __ _ 6.2(a)_ (in the

Board or any committee thereof shall have resolved to make an Adverse

party from any liability or obligation with respect to any willful breach of
any covenant contained in this Agreement or fraud.

ARTICLE VIII

 

 _MISCELLANEOUS_

 

8.1 _Fees and Expenses_.

 

(a) Whether or not the Merger is consummated, all costs and expenses
incurred in connection with this Agreement and the transactions contemplated
hereby shall be paid by the party incurring such costs or expenses; _provided_
, _however_ , that the Company and the Buyer shall each be responsible for 50%
of the fee in connection with the filings under the HSR Act contemplated by
_Section_ __ _ 5.5(b)_.

(b) If this Agreement is terminated by the Buyer pursuant to _Section_ __
_ 7.1(c)_ or by the Company pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 7.1(d)_, then the
Company shall pay to the Buyer in immediately available funds a termination
fee in an amount equal to the Termination Fee.

(c) In the event that (i) an Acquisition Proposal has been publicly
proposed by any Person (other than the Buyer or any of its affiliates) or an
Acquisition Proposal has otherwise become known to the Companys directors or
officers, or its stockholders generally, (ii) thereafter this Agreement is
terminated by either the Company or the Buyer pursuant to _Section_ __ _
7.1(b)(i)_ or _7.1(b)(iii)_ , or by the Buyer pursuant to _Section_ __ _
7.1(b)(iv)_ or _7.1(b)(v)_ , and (iii) within 12 months after the termination
of this Agreement, the Company or any of its Subsidiaries enters into any
definitive agreement providing for an Acquisition Proposal, or an Acquisition
Proposal is consummated, then the Company shall pay the Buyer the Termination
Fee upon the first to occur of the events described in clause (iii) of this
sentence; provided that, for purposes of this sentence, " _Acquisition
Proposal_ " shall have meaning assigned to such term in _Section_ __ _
5.3(g)_, except that the references to "20% or more" shall be deemed to be
references to "50% or more".

(d) Any payment of the Termination Fee pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 8.1(b)_
shall be made by wire transfer of immediately available funds to an account
designated by the Buyer within three Business Days after termination of this
Agreement by the

 



85

    

 Buyer. Any payment of the Termination Fee pursuant to _Section_ __ _
8.1(c)_ shall be made prior to the first to occur of the execution of a
definitive agreement providing for an Acquisition Proposal or the
consummation of an Acquisition Proposal. Each party acknowledges that the
agreements contained in this _Section_ __ _ 8.1_ are an integral part of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and that, without these
agreements, no party would enter into this Agreement; accordingly, if a party
fails promptly to pay or cause to be paid the amounts due pursuant to this
_Section_ __ _ 8.1_, and, in order to obtain such payment, the other party
commences a suit that results in a judgment against such party for the amounts
set forth in this _Section_ __ _ 8.1_, such party shall pay to the other
party (as the case may be) its reasonable costs and expenses (including
attorneys fees and expenses) in connection with such suit and any appeal
relating thereto, together with interest on the amounts set forth in this
_Section_ __ _ 8.1_ at the prime rate of Citibank, N.A. in effect on the
date such payment was required to be made.

(e) This _Section_ __ _ 8.1_ shall survive any termination of this
Agreement. In no event shall the Buyer be entitled to receive under this
_Article VIII_ an aggregate amount equal to more than the Termination Fee.

 

8.2 _Amendment; Waiver_.

 

(a) This Agreement may be amended by the parties to this Agreement, by
action taken or authorized by their respective boards of directors, at any
time before or after approval by the stockholders of the Company of the
matters presented in connection with the Merger, but after any such approval
no amendment shall be made that requires the approval of the stockholders of
the Company under the DGCL without the approval of the stockholders of the
Company. This Agreement may not be amended except by an instrument in writing
signed on behalf of each of the parties hereto.

 

(b) At any time prior to the Effective Time, the parties to this Agreement
may (i) extend the time for the performance of any of the obligations or
other acts of the other parties hereto, (ii) waive any inaccuracies in the
representations and warranties of the other parties contained herein or in any
document, certificate or writing delivered pursuant hereto by the other party
or (iii) waive compliance with any of the agreements or conditions of the

SUPPORT AGREEMENT

 

THIS SUPPORT AGREEMENT (this " _Agreement_ ") is dated as of August 12, 2020,
by and among each stockholder of Montage Resources Corporation, a Delaware
corporation (the " _Company_ "), set forth on _Schedule A_ hereto (each, a "
_Stockholder_ " and collectively, the " _Stockholders_ "), and Southwestern
Energy Company, a Delaware corporation (" _Parent_ ").

W I T N E S S E T H:

 

WHEREAS, concurrently with the execution and delivery of this Agreement,
Parent and the Company are entering into an Agreement and Plan of Merger,
dated as of the date hereof (as the same may be amended or supplemented, the "
_Merger Agreement_ "), providing that, among other things, upon the terms and
subject to the conditions set forth in the Merger Agreement, the Company will
be merged with Parent (the " _Merger_ "), and each outstanding share of common
stock, par value $0.01 per share, of the Company (" _Company Common Stock_ ")
will be converted into the Merger Consideration;

 

WHEREAS, each Stockholder beneficially owns such number of shares of Company
Common Stock set forth opposite such Stockholders name on  _Schedule A_
hereto (collectively, such shares of Company Common Stock are referred to
herein as the " _Subject Shares_ "); and

 

WHEREAS, as a condition and inducement to Parent to enter into the Merger
Agreement, Parent has required that the Stockholders enter into
this Agreement.

NOW, THEREFORE, to induce Parent to enter into, and in consideration of its
entering into, the Merger Agreement, and in consideration of the promises and
the representations, warranties and agreements contained herein and therein,
the parties, intending to be legally bound hereby, agree as follows:

 

1. _Representations and Warranties of each Stockholder_. Each Stockholder hereby represents and warrants to Parent, severally and not jointly, as of the date hereof as follows: 

(a) _Due Organization_. Such Stockholder is an entity duly formed under
the laws of its jurisdiction of formation and is validly existing and in good
standing under the laws thereof.

   

(b) _Authority; No Violation_. Such Stockholder has full organizational
power and authority to execute and deliver this Agreement and to perform its
obligations hereunder. The execution and delivery of this Agreement and the
performance of its obligations hereunder have been duly and validly approved
by the governing authority of such Stockholder and no other organizational
proceedings on the part of such Stockholder are necessary to approve this
Agreement and to perform its obligations hereunder. This Agreement has been
duly and validly executed and delivered by such Stockholder and (assuming due
authorization, execution and delivery by Parent) this Agreement constitutes a
valid and binding obligation of such Stockholder, enforceable against such
Stockholder in accordance with its terms, except that such enforceability (i)
may be limited by bankruptcy, insolvency, moratorium or other similar laws
affecting or relating to the enforcement of creditors rights generally and
(ii) is subject to general principles of equity and the discretion of the
court before which any proceedings seeking injunctive relief or specific
performance may be brought. Neither the execution and delivery of this
Agreement by such Stockholder, nor the consummation by such Stockholder of
the transactions contemplated hereby, nor compliance by such Stockholder with
any of the terms or provisions hereof, will (x) violate any provision of the
governing documents of such Stockholder, (y) violate any statute, code,
ordinance, rule, regulation, judgment, order, writ, decree or injunction
applicable to such Stockholder, or any of its properties or assets, or (z)
violate, conflict with, result in a breach of any provision of or the loss of
any benefit under, constitute a default (or an event which, with notice or
lapse of time, or both, would constitute a default) under, result in the
termination of or a right of termination or cancellation under, accelerate the
performance required by, or result in the creation of any lien, claim,
mortgage, encumbrance, pledge, deed of trust, security interest, equity or
charge of any kind (each, a " _Lien_ ") upon any of the Subject Shares
pursuant to any of the terms, conditions or provisions of any note, bond,
mortgage, indenture, deed of trust, license, lease, agreement or other
instrument or obligation to which such Stockholder is a party, or by which it
or any of its properties or assets may be bound or affected, except, in the
case of this clause (z), for such matters that would not, individually or in
the aggregate, impair the ability of such Stockholder to perform its
obligations under this Agreement.

 

(c) _The Subject Shares_. As of the date of this Agreement, such
Stockholder is the beneficial owner of and, together with the applicable
controlling entity or entities of such Stockholder set forth on _Schedule A_
hereto (as applicable, the " _Controlling Entities_ "), has the sole right to
vote and dispose of the Subject Shares set forth opposite such Stockholders
name on _Schedule A_ hereto, free and clear of any Liens whatsoever, except
for any Liens which arise hereunder, in each case except as disclosed in any
Schedule 13D filed by such Stockholder prior to the date hereof. None of the
Subject Shares is subject to any voting trust or other similar agreement,
arrangement or restriction, except as contemplated by this Agreement. Without
limiting the generality of 

 



2

    

 the foregoing, (i) there are no agreements or arrangements of any kind,
contingent or otherwise, obligating such Stockholder to sell, transfer
(including by tendering into any tender or exchange offer), assign, grant a
participation interest in, option, pledge, hypothecate or otherwise dispose of
or encumber, including by operation of law or otherwise (each, a " _Transfer_
"), or cause to be Transferred, any of the Subject Shares, other than a
Transfer, such as a hedging or derivative transaction, with respect to which
such Stockholder (and/or its Controlling Entities) retains its Subject Shares
and the sole right to vote, dispose of and exercise dissenters rights with
respect to its Subject Shares during the Applicable Period, and (ii) no Person
has any contractual or other right or obligation to purchase or otherwise
acquire any of the Subject Shares. Other than the Subject Shares, such
Stockholder does not own any equity interests or other equity-based securities
in the Company or any of its Subsidiaries.

 

(d) _Absence of Litigation_. There is no litigation, suit, claim, action,
proceeding or investigation pending, or to the knowledge of such Stockholder,
threatened against such Stockholder, or any property or asset of such
Stockholder, before any Governmental Entity that seeks to delay or prevent the
consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

(e) _No Consents Required_. No consent of, or registration, declaration
or filing with, any Person or Governmental Entity is required to be obtained
or made by or with respect to such Stockholder in connection with the
execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement and except for any
applicable requirements and filings with the SEC, if any, under the Exchange
Act and except where the failure to obtain such consents, approvals,
authorizations or permits, or to make such filings or notifications, would not
prevent or delay the performance by such Stockholder of such Stockholders
obligations under this Agreement in any material respect.

 

(f) _Reliance_. Such Stockholder understands and acknowledges that Parent
is entering into the Merger Agreement in reliance upon such Stockholders
execution and delivery of this Agreement.

 

(g) _Stockholder Has Adequate Information._ Such Stockholder is a
sophisticated seller with respect to the Subject Shares and has adequate
information concerning the business and financial condition of Parent to make
an informed decision regarding the Merger and the transactions contemplated
thereby and has independently and without reliance upon Parent and based on
such information as such Stockholder has deemed appropriate, made its own
analysis and decision to enter into this Agreement. Such Stockholder
acknowledges that Parent has not made and does not make any 

 



3

    

 representation or warranty, whether express or implied, of any kind or
character except as expressly set forth in the Merger Agreement and this
Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, and for the elimination of doubt,
Stockholder is not waiving and is expressly preserving any claims that might
arise in connection with the Registration Statement contemplated to be filed
in connection with the Merger.

 

2. _Representations and Warranties of Parent_. Parent hereby represents and warrants to each Stockholder as of the date hereof as follows: 

(a) _Due Organization_. Parent is a corporation duly incorporated under
the laws of the State of Delaware and is validly existing and in good standing
under the laws thereof.

 

(b) _Authority; No Violation_. Parent has full corporate power and
authority to execute and deliver this Agreement. The execution and delivery
of this Agreement have been duly and validly approved by the Board of
Directors of Parent and no other corporate proceedings on the part of Parent
are necessary to approve this Agreement. This Agreement has been duly and
validly executed and delivered by Parent and (assuming due authorization,
execution and delivery by the Stockholder) this Agreement constitutes a valid
and binding obligation of Parent, enforceable against Parent in accordance
with its terms except that such enforceability (i) may be limited by
bankruptcy, insolvency, moratorium or other similar laws affecting or relating
to the enforcement of creditors rights generally and (ii) is subject to
general principles of equity and the discretion of the court before which any
proceedings seeking injunctive relief or specific performance may be brought.
Neither the execution and delivery of this Agreement by Parent, nor the
consummation by Parent of the transactions contemplated hereby, nor
compliance by Parent with any of the terms or provisions hereof, will (x)
violate any provision of the governing documents of Parent or the certificate
of incorporation, bylaws or similar governing documents of any of Parents
Subsidiaries, (y) violate any statute, code, ordinance, rule, regulation,
judgment, order, writ, decree or injunction applicable to the Parent or any of
Parents Subsidiaries, or any of their respective properties or assets, or
(z) violate, conflict with, result in a breach of any provision of or the loss
of any benefit under, constitute a default (or an event which, with notice or
lapse of time, or both, would constitute a default) under, result in the
termination of or a right of termination or cancellation under, accelerate
the performance required by, or result in the creation of any Lien upon any of
the respective properties or assets of Parent or any of Parents Subsidiaries
under, any of the terms, conditions or provisions of any note, bond,
mortgage, indenture, deed of trust, license, lease, agreement or other
instrument or obligation to which Parent or any of Parents Subsidiaries is a
party, or by which they or any of their respective properties or assets may
be bound or affected.

3. _Covenants of Each Stockholder_. Each Stockholder, severally and not jointly, agrees as follows; _provided_ that all of the following covenants shall apply solely to actions taken by such Stockholder in its capacity as a stockholder of the Company: 

 

(a) _Agreement to Vote Subject Shares_. During the Applicable Period (as
defined below), at any meeting of the stockholders of the Company, however
called, or at any postponement or adjournment thereof, or in any other
circumstance upon which a vote or other approval of all or some of the
stockholders of the Company is sought, such Stockholder shall, and shall
cause any holder of record of its Subject Shares on any applicable record date
to, vote: (i) in favor of adoption of the Merger Agreement and approval of any
other matter that is required to be approved by the stockholders of the
Company in order to effect the Merger; (ii) against any merger agreement or
merger (other than the Merger Agreement and the Merger), consolidation,
combination, sale or transfer of a material amount of assets,
reorganization, recapitalization, dissolution, liquidation or winding up of
or by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries that is prohibited by the Merger
Agreement, unless such transaction is approved in writing by Parent, or any
Alternative Proposal, and (iii) against any amendment of the Companys
certificate of incorporation or bylaws or other proposal or transaction
involving the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, which amendment or other
proposal or transaction would in any manner delay, impede, frustrate, prevent
or nullify the Merger, the Merger Agreement or any of the transactions
contemplated by the Merger Agreement or change in any manner the voting rights
of any outstanding class of capital stock of the Company. During the
Applicable Period, such Stockholder (and/or its Controlling Entities) shall
retain at all times the right to vote all of its Subject Shares in such
Stockholders sole discretion and without any other limitation on those
matters other than those set forth in this _Section_ __ _ 3(a)_ that are at
any time or from time to time presented for consideration to the Companys
stockholders generally. During the Applicable Period, in the event that any
meeting of the stockholders of the Company is held, such Stockholder shall
(or shall cause the holder of record on any applicable record date to) appear
at such meeting or otherwise cause all of its Subject Shares to be counted as
present thereat for purposes of establishing a quorum. During the Applicable
Period, such Stockholder further agrees not to commit or agree, and to cause
any record holder of its Subject Shares not to commit or agree, to take any
action inconsistent with the foregoing during the Applicable Period. "
_Applicable Period_ " means the period from and including the date of this
Agreement to and including the date of the termination of this Agreement.

 



5

    

(b) _No Transfers_. Except as provided in the last sentence of this
_Section_ __ _ 3(b)_, such Stockholder agrees not to, and to cause any record
holder of its Subject Shares, not to, in any such case directly or indirectly,
during the Applicable Period (i) Transfer or enter into any agreement, option
or other arrangement (including any profit sharing arrangement) with respect
to the Transfer of, any of its Subject Shares (or any interest therein) to any
Person, other than the exchange of its Subject Shares for Merger
Consideration in accordance with the Merger Agreement or (ii) grant any
proxies, or deposit any of its Subject Shares into any voting trust or enter
into any voting arrangement, whether by proxy, voting agreement or otherwise,
with respect to its Subject Shares, other than pursuant to this Agreement.
Subject to the last sentence of this _Section_ __ _ 3(b)_, such Stockholder
further agrees not to commit or agree to take, and to cause any record holder
of any of its Subject Shares not to commit or agree to take, any of the
foregoing actions during the Applicable Period. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
such Stockholder shall have the right to (a) Transfer its Subject Shares to an
Affiliate if and only if such Affiliate shall have agreed in writing, in a
manner acceptable in form and substance to Parent, (i) to accept such Subject
Shares subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, and (ii) to be
bound by this Agreement as if it were "the Stockholder" for all purposes of
this Agreement; _provided_ , _however_ , that no such transfer shall relieve
such Stockholder from its obligations under this Agreement with respect to any
Subject Shares or (b) Transfer its Subject Shares in a transaction, such as a
hedging or derivative transaction, with respect to which such Stockholder
retains the sole right to vote its Subject Shares during the Applicable
Period; _provided_ that no such transaction shall (x) in any way limit any of
the obligations of such Stockholder under this Agreement, or (y) have any
adverse effect on the ability of the Stockholder to perform its obligations
under this Agreement.

 

(c) _Reserved_.

 

(d) _Adjustment to Subject Shares_. In case of a stock dividend or
distribution, or any change in the Company Common Stock by reason of any
stock dividend or distribution, split-up, recapitalization, combination,
exchange of shares or the like, the term "Subject Shares" shall be deemed to
refer to and include the Subject Shares as well as all such stock dividends
and distributions and any securities into which or for which any or all of the
Subject Shares may be changed or exchanged or which are received in such
transaction.

(e) _Non-Solicitation_. Except to the extent that the Company or the
Company Board is permitted to do so under the Merger Agreement, but subject to
any limitations imposed on the Company or the Company Board under the Merger
Agreement, such Stockholder agrees, solely in its capacity as a stockholder
of the Company, that it shall not, and shall cause its Affiliates and its and
their respective agents and representatives not to, directly or indirectly,
(i) initiate, solicit, knowingly encourage or knowingly facilitate (including
by way of furnishing information) any Alternative Proposal, (ii) participate
or engage in any discussions or negotiations with, or disclose any non-public
information or data relating to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to any
Person that has made an Alternative Proposal, (iii) approve, endorse or
recommend (or publicly propose to approve, endorse or recommend) any
Alternative Proposal or (iv) enter into any letter of intent, term

their respective investment bankers, attorneys, accountants and other
representatives to, immediately cease and cause to be terminated any
discussions or negotiations with any Person conducted heretofore with respect
to any Alternative Proposal. Nothing contained in this  _Section_ __ _ 3(e)_

officer of the Company or designated by such Stockholder as a director of
officer of the Company from taking actions in his capacity as a director or
officer of the Company, including taking any actions permitted under Section
5.3 of the Merger Agreement.

Subject to the preceding sentence, this Agreement will be binding upon, inure to the benefit of and be enforceable by the parties hereto and their respective successors and assigns. Except as otherwise expressly provided herein, this Agreement (including the documents and instruments referred to herein) is not intended to confer upon any Person other than the parties hereto any rights or remedies hereunder; _provided_ , _however_ , that the Company is an intended third-party beneficiary of the agreement of the Stockholders set forth in _Section_ __ _ 3(c)_ hereof. 

 

5. _Termination_. This Agreement and the covenants and agreements set forth in this Agreement shall automatically terminate (without any further action of the parties) upon the earliest to occur of: (a) the termination of the Merger Agreement in accordance with its terms; (b) the Effective Time; (c) the date of any modification, waiver or amendment to the Merger Agreement effected without such Stockholders consent that (y) decreases the amount or changes the form of consideration payable to all of the stockholders of the Company pursuant to the terms of the Merger Agreement as in effect on the date of this Agreement or (z) otherwise materially

 adversely affects the interests of such Stockholder; (d) the mutual written
consent of the parties hereto; and (e) the Termination Date. In the event of
termination of this Agreement pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 5_, this

(c) _Interpretation_. When a reference is made in this Agreement to a
Section, such reference shall be to a Section to this Agreement unless
otherwise indicated. The headings contained in this Agreement are for
reference purposes only and shall not affect in any way the meaning or
interpretation of this Agreement. Wherever the words "include," "includes" or
"including" are used in this Agreement, they shall be deemed to be followed by
the words "without limitation." The phrases "the date of this Agreement," "the
date hereof" and terms of similar import, unless the context otherwise
requires, shall be deemed to refer to August 12, 2020.

 

(d) _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed in counterparts, all of
which shall be considered one and the same agreement and shall become
effective when counterparts have been signed by each of the parties hereto and
delivered to the other parties hereto, it being understood that all parties
hereto need not sign the same counterpart.

(e) _Entire Agreement_. This Agreement (including the documents and
the instruments referred to herein) constitutes the entire agreement and
supersedes all prior agreements and understandings, both written and oral,
among the parties hereto with respect to the subject matter hereof.

 



9

    

(f) _Governing Law_. This Agreement shall be governed by, and construed
in accordance with, the laws of the State of Delaware regardless of the laws
that might otherwise govern under applicable principles of conflicts of law
thereof or of any other jurisdiction.

 

(g) _Severability_. If any term, provision, covenant or restriction
herein, or the application thereof to any circumstance, shall, to any extent,
be held by a court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid, void or
unenforceable, the remainder of the terms, provisions, covenants and
restrictions herein and the application thereof to any other circumstances,
shall remain in full force and effect, shall not in any way be affected,
impaired or invalidated, and shall be enforced to the fullest extent permitted
by law, and the parties hereto shall reasonably negotiate in good faith
a substitute term or provision that comes as close as possible to the
invalidated and unenforceable term or provision, and that puts each party
hereto in a position as nearly comparable as possible to the position each
such party would have been in but for the finding of invalidity or
unenforceability, while remaining valid and enforceable.

 

(h) _Waiver_. Any provisions of this Agreement may be waived at any time
by the party that is entitled to the benefits thereof. Any agreement on the
part of a party hereto to any such extension or waiver shall be valid only if
set forth in a written instrument signed on behalf of such party, but such
extension or waiver or failure to insist on strict compliance with an
obligation, covenant, agreement or condition shall not operate as a waiver of,
or estoppel with respect to, any subsequent or other failure.

 

(i) _Further Assurances_. Each Stockholder will, from time to time, (i) at
the request of Parent take, or cause to be taken, all actions, and do, or
cause to be done, and assist and cooperate with the other parties hereto in
doing, all things reasonably necessary, proper or advisable to carry out the
intent and purposes of this Agreement and (ii) execute and deliver, or cause
to be executed and delivered, such additional or further consents, documents
and other instruments as Parent may reasonably request for the purpose of
effectively carrying out the intent and purposes of this Agreement.

(j) _Publicity_. Except as otherwise required by law (including
securities laws and regulations) and the regulations of any national stock
exchange, so long as this Agreement is in effect, the Stockholder shall not
issue or cause the publication of any press release or other public
announcement with respect to, or otherwise make any public statement
concerning, the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or the Merger
Agreement, without the consent of Parent, which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld.

 



10

    

(k) _Capitalized Terms_. Capitalized terms used but not defined herein
shall have the meanings set forth in the Merger Agreement. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, the term "Affiliate" as used in _Section_ __ _ 3(e)_ of this
Agreement shall not include any portfolio company of EnCap Investments L.P.
or its affiliated investment funds, other than the Company and its
Subsidiaries, and except for any portfolio company taking any action that
would otherwise be prohibited by _Section_ __ _ 3(e)_ at the direction or
encouragement of any Stockholder or Controlling Entity.

7. _Stockholder Capacity_. Each Stockholder signs solely in its capacity as the beneficial owner of its Subject Shares and nothing contained herein shall limit or affect any actions taken by any officer, director, partner, Affiliate or representative of such Stockholder who is or becomes an officer or a director of the Company in his or her capacity as an officer or director of the Company, and none of such actions in such capacity shall be deemed to constitute a breach of this Agreement. Each Stockholder signs individually solely on behalf of itself and not on behalf of any other Stockholder. 

8. _Enforcement_. The parties hereto agree that irreparable damage would occur in the event that any of the provisions of this Agreement were not performed in accordance with their specific terms or were otherwise breached and that money damages would not be a sufficient remedy of any such breach. It is accordingly agreed that, in addition to any other remedy to which they are entitled at law or in equity, the parties hereto shall be entitled to specific performance and injunctive or other equitable relief, without the necessity of proving the inadequacy of money damages. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Parent agrees that with respect to any damage claim that might be brought against any Stockholder, any of its Affiliates under this Agreement, and without regard to whether such claim sounds in contract, tort or any other legal or equitable theory of relief, that damages are limited to actual damages and expressly waive any right to recover special damages, including, without limitation, lost profits as well as any punitive or exemplary damages. In the event of any litigation over the terms of this Agreement, the prevailing party in any such litigation shall be entitled to reasonable attorneys fees and costs incurred in connection with such litigation. The parties hereto further agree that any action or proceeding relating to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby shall be brought and determined in the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware (or, if the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware declines to accept jurisdiction over a particular matter, the Superior Court of the State of Delaware (Complex Commercial Division) or, if subject matter jurisdiction over the matter that is the subject of the action or proceeding is vested exclusively in the federal courts of the United States of America, the federal court of the United States of America sitting in the district of Delaware) and any appellate court from any thereof. In addition, each of the parties hereto (a) consents that each party hereto irrevocably submits to the exclusive jurisdiction and venue of such courts listed in this _Section_ __ _ 8_ in the event any dispute 

 



11

    

 arises out of this Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated hereby,
(b) agrees that each party hereto irrevocably waives the defense of an
inconvenient forum and all other defenses to venue in any such court in any
such action or proceeding, and (c) waives any right to trial by jury with
respect to any claim or proceeding related to or arising out of this Agreement
or any of the transactions contemplated hereby. EACH PARTY HERETO HEREBY
IRREVOCABLY AND UNCONDITIONALLY WAIVES ANY RIGHT IT MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL BY
JURY IN RESPECT OF ANY LITIGATION OR PROCEEDING DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY ARISING
OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY.
EACH PARTY HERETO CERTIFIES AND ACKNOWLEDGES THAT (I) NO REPRESENTATIVE, AGENT
OR ATTORNEY OF ANY OTHER PARTY HAS REPRESENTED, EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE, THAT
SUCH OTHER PARTY WOULD NOT, IN THE EVENT OF LITIGATION, SEEK TO ENFORCE ANY
OF SUCH WAIVER, (II) IT UNDERSTANDS AND HAS CONSIDERED THE IMPLICATIONS OF
SUCH WAIVER, (III) IT MAKES SUCH WAIVER VOLUNTARILY, AND (IV) IT HAS BEEN
INDUCED TO ENTER INTO THIS AGREEMENT BY, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE MUTUAL
WAIVERS AND CERTIFICATIONS IN THIS _SECTION_ __ _ 8_.

9. _No Ownership Interest_. Nothing contained in this Agreement shall be deemed to vest in Parent or any other Person any direct or indirect ownership or incidence of ownership of, or with respect to, any Subject Shares. Subject to the restrictions and requirements set forth in this Agreement, all rights, ownership and economic benefits of and relating to the Subject Shares shall remain vested in and belong to each Stockholder, and this Agreement shall not confer any right, power or authority upon Parent or any other Person to direct the Stockholder in the voting of any of the Subject Shares (except as otherwise specifically provided for herein).
