by Parent) shall remain as the membership interests of the Second Merger
Surviving Entity.

  

Section 2.7 _Fractional Shares_. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary contained in _Section 2.6(a)(ii)(B)_ , no fraction of a share of
Parent Common Stock will be issued as Stock Merger Consideration, and in lieu
thereof an amount of cash (rounded to the nearest whole cent) equal to the
product of (i) such fraction, multiplied by (ii) the Fair Market Value of the
Parent Common Stock determined as of the trading day immediately prior to the
date of issuance shall be added to the Cash Merger Consideration.

  

Section 2.8 _Cancellation and Retirement of Company Common Stock_. As of
the First Merger Effective Time, all shares of Company Common Stock that are
issued and outstanding immediately prior to the First Merger Effective Time
shall no longer be outstanding and shall automatically be cancelled and
retired and shall cease to exist, and each certificate representing any such
shares of Company Common Stock shall be converted into the right to receive
the Merger Consideration to be paid in consideration therefor pursuant to
this Article 2. From and after the First Merger Effective Time, there shall
be no further registration of transfers on the

        



  

records of the Company of shares of Company Common Stock which were
outstanding immediately prior to the First Merger Effective Time.

  

Section 2.9 _Exchange of Certificates; Payment of Initial Merger
Consideration_.  Parent acknowledges that, as of the First Merger Effective
Time, MHRx will be distributing and assigning to its members in accordance
with its Governing Documents the right to receive directly from Parent the
Initial Parent Shares (other than the Escrow Shares) and the Initial Cash
Merger Consideration net of expenses as contemplated by _Section 8.6_ (other
than the Escrow Cash), and Parent agrees to facilitate such distribution
by delivering such Initial Merger Consideration directly to the MHRx members
in accordance with specific written directions to be provided by MHRx to
Parent not less than two (2) Business Days prior to the Closing Date for
such purposes. On the Closing Date, MHRx shall surrender to Parent all
certificates representing all of the shares of Company Common Stock and
Parent shall deliver or cause to be delivered to the members of MHRx (i) the
Initial Cash Merger Consideration (less the amount of Initial Cash Merger
Consideration to be deposited in the Escrow Fund pursuant to _Section 2.10_
and the Escrow Agreement) (which shall be paid by wire transfer of
immediately available funds to accounts specified in writing by MHRx to
Parent not less than two (2) Business Days prior to the Closing) and (ii)
certificates evidencing the Initial Parent Shares (other than the Initial
Parent Shares to be deposited in the Escrow Fund pursuant to _Section 2.10_
and the Escrow Agreement) registered in the names of the MHRx members as
specified in the instructions delivered by MHRx to Parent (or, if MHRx so
specifies in such instruction that any of its members wishes to receive all
or a portion of the Initial Parent Shares in book-entry or other
uncertificated form, book-entry transfers evidencing the issuance of such
portion of the Initial Parent Shares in accordance with such instructions).
MHRx agrees to use its commercially reasonable efforts to provide Parent with
such documents and information as it may reasonably request in connection
with the issuance of such Initial Parent Shares, including completed Forms
W-9 or, if applicable, appropriate Forms W-8 for each MHRx member who
receives the Initial Parent Shares and information with respect to each MHRx
member for Parents stock records.

  

Section 2.10 _Escrow Fund_. As soon as practicable after the First
Merger Effective Time, without any act of any holder of Company Common Stock,
a portion of the Initial Stock Merger Consideration consisting of 708,750
shares of Parent Common Stock (such shares being the " _Escrow Shares_ ")
and $17,325,000 of the Initial Cash Merger Consideration (the " _Escrow Cash_
") shall be deposited with The Bank of New York (or such other
institution mutually selected by Parent and the Company) as escrow agent (the
" _Escrow Agent_ "), such deposit to constitute the "Escrow Fund" and to be
governed by the terms set forth herein and in an escrow agreement among
Parent, the Shareholder Representative and the Escrow Agent (the " _Escrow
Agreement_ "), the form of which is attached as _Exhibit D_ hereto. Each
Person who is issued Initial Parent Shares shall have a proportionate
interest in the Escrow Shares and the Escrow Cash deposited in the Escrow
Fund (the amount of such proportionate interests to be provided to Parent by
MHRx not later than two (2) Business Days prior to the Closing Date). The
Escrow Shares shall be registered in the names of such MHRx members. Any
shares of Parent Common Stock or other Parent equity securities (including
shares issued upon a stock split) (" _New Shares"_ ) issued or distributed by
Parent in respect of the Escrow Shares that have not been released from the
Escrow Fund shall be added to the Escrow Fund, and become a part thereof;
_provided_ , _however_ , any other dividends or distributions on the Escrow
Shares (including on the New Shares) made in cash or property shall be
currently distributed to the owners of such shares.

  



        



  

The owners of the Escrow Shares shall pay any taxes on such dividends.  The
parties hereto shall cause each record owner of Escrow Shares to have the
ability to direct the voting of that number of Escrow Shares contributed to
the Escrow Fund on behalf of such shareholder (and on any New Shares) so long
as such shares are held in the Escrow Fund. Parent shall show the Parent
Common Stock contributed to the Escrow Fund as issued and outstanding on its
balance sheet.

  

Section 2.11 _Withholding_. Parent, the Company and MHRx, as
applicable, shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from any consideration
payable or otherwise deliverable pursuant to this Agreement to any holder
such amounts as may be required to be deducted or withheld therefrom under
the Code or any provision of state, local or foreign Tax law or under any
other applicable legal requirement. To the extent such amounts are so
deducted or withheld, such amounts shall be treated for all purposes under
this Agreement as having been paid to the Person to whom such amounts would
otherwise have been paid.

  

Section 2.12 _Post Closing Adjustment Relating to CMS Reconciliation_.

  

(a) _Post-Closing Adjustment to Merger Consideration_. Upon the
final determination of the CMS Reconciliation Payment Amount pursuant to this
_Section 2.12_ , the Merger Consideration shall be adjusted as follows: (a)
if the CMS Reconciliation Payment Amount is a positive number, then the
Merger Consideration shall be increased on a dollar for dollar basis by the
CMS Reconciliation Payment Amount and (b) if the CMS Reconciliation Payment
Amount is a negative number, then the Merger Consideration shall be decreased
on a dollar for dollar basis by the CMS Reconciliation Payment Amount.  If
the CMS Reconciliation Payment Amount is zero, the Merger Consideration shall
not be adjusted pursuant to this _Section 2.12_. If the adjustments pursuant
to this _Section 2.12_ result in an increase in the Merger Consideration,
Parent shall pay to each Person who received the Initial Merger Consideration
its pro rata share of such increase in accordance with _Section 2.12(e)_
below. If the adjustments pursuant to this _Section 2.12_ result in a
reduction in the Merger Consideration, the Indemnifying Members shall be
severally obligated to pay to Parent their respective Indemnification
Percentage of such decrease in accordance with _Section 2.12(e)_ below.
Payments made pursuant to this _Section 2.12_ shall not be subject to any
right of setoff.

  

(b) _Pre-Closing Finalization of the CMS Reconciliation Process_.
 Notwithstanding the foregoing, the parties hereto acknowledge and
agree that it may be possible to calculate and finalize the CMS
Reconciliation Payment Amount prior to the Closing depending on when the 2006
CMS Reconciliation becomes final. In the event that the CMS Reconciliation
Amount does become final prior to the Closing, the parties shall seek to
agree on the Actual Net CMS Reconciliation Amount and the CMS Reconciliation
Payment Amount prior to Closing and if possible adjust the Initial Merger
Consideration accordingly. For such purposes, the review and
dispute resolution provisions of _Section 2.12(d_ ) shall apply.

  

(c) _CMS Reconciliation Process_. In connection with the
Companys participation in the process by which CMS calculates final payments
and determines if any retroactive adjustment or reconciliation is
necessary pursuant to 42 C.F.R. 423.343 for the 2006 plan year (the " _2006
CMS Reconciliation_ "), the Company and Parent shall use their
commercially reasonable efforts to conduct the 2006 CMS Reconciliation in
good faith and in accordance with the prescribed methodology required
pursuant to 42 C.F.R. 423.343. The

        



  

Company and Parent shall keep the Shareholder Representative informed on a
reasonably current basis with respect to items that pertain to the 2006 CMS
Reconciliation, State Claims Post Reconciliation and Plan to Plan Post
Reconciliation, and the 2006 CMS reconciliation relating to the existing Part
D business of the Parent and its Subsidiaries. The Company and
Parent further agree to consult with the Shareholder Representative on all
material decisions relating to the 2006 CMS Reconciliation, State Claims Post
Reconciliation and Plan to Plan Post Reconciliation, and shall permit the
Shareholder Representative to review and comment on all material
correspondence and submissions pertaining to the 2006 CMS Reconciliation,
State Claims Post Reconciliation and Plan to Plan Post Reconciliation, and to
review all material correspondence and submission pertaining to the 2006 CMS
reconciliation relating to the existing Part D business of the Parent and its
Subsidiaries.

  

(d) _CMS Reconciliation Statement; Dispute Resolution_.

  

(i) As soon as practicable and in any event not later than thirty (30) days
after the 2006 CMS Reconciliation becomes final and is made available, Parent
shall, at Parents expense, prepare or cause to be prepared and delivered to
the Shareholder Representative a statement (the " _CMS Reconciliation
Statement_ ") setting forth in reasonable detail its determination (together
with all supporting calculations) of the Actual Net CMS Reconciliation Amount
and the CMS Reconciliation Payment Amount, such amounts and statement to be
prepared and calculated in good faith and in accordance with the terms of
this Agreement.

  

(ii) Parent shall provide the Shareholder Representative and its
representatives prompt and complete access to all of the work papers of
Parent and its representatives relating to the preparation of the CMS
Reconciliation Statement and the 2006 CMS reconciliation relating to the
existing Part D business of the Parent and its Subsidiaries (as well
as access to all other books and records, employees and accountants of Parent
and its Subsidiaries as may be reasonably requested by the
Shareholder Representative in connection with its review of such CMS
Reconciliation Statement and the 2006 CMS reconciliation relating to the
existing Part D business of the Parent and its Subsidiaries), _provided_
_further_  that Parent shall only be required to exercise its commercially
reasonable efforts to require its accountants to provide the Shareholder
Representative with access to such accountants work papers.  If the
Shareholder Representative determines that the CMS Reconciliation Statement
(or the Actual Net CMS Reconciliation Amount or CMS Reconciliation Payment
Amount (including the tax rate used to calculate such amount) has not been
prepared or calculated in accordance with this Agreement, the
Shareholder Representative shall be entitled to deliver a notice of
disagreement (the " _CMS Reconciliation Disagreement Notice_ ") to Parent
within 60 days of its receipt of the CMS Reconciliation Statement.  The CMS
Reconciliation Disagreement Notice shall set forth in reasonable detail those
items or amounts set forth in the CMS Reconciliation Statement as to which
the Shareholder Representative disagrees and the reasons for such
disagreement. If no CMS Reconciliation Disagreement Notice is delivered
within such 60-day period, the CMS Reconciliation Statement (and the Actual
Net CMS Reconciliation Amount and CMS Reconciliation

  



        



  

Payment Amount) shall become final, conclusive and binding on the parties
hereto for all purposes of this _Section 2.12_ as of 5:00 p.m. (New York City
time) on the 60th day, or, if earlier, upon the written acceptance of the CMS
Reconciliation Statement by the Shareholder Representative.

  

(iii) If the Shareholder Representative delivers a CMS Reconciliation
Disagreement Notice to Parent within the 60-day period described above, the
parties shall use their good faith, commercially reasonable efforts to reach
agreement on the disputed items or amounts in order to finalize such CMS
Reconciliation Statement during the thirty (30) day period following the
delivery of such CMS Reconciliation Statement. If the parties do not resolve
all such disputed items or amounts set forth in the CMS Reconciliation
Statement within such thirty (30) day period, Parent and the Shareholder
Representative shall retain an appraisal or valuation firm of national
reputation that is mutually acceptable to Parent and the Shareholder
Representative (each acting reasonably) (the " _CMS Dispute Arbitrator_ ")
pursuant to a customary engagement letter proposed by the CMS Dispute
Arbitrator and reasonably acceptable to Parent and the Shareholder
Representative and submit all such disputed items and amounts to the CMS
Dispute Arbitrator for final resolution of such disputed items and amounts in
accordance with the terms of this Agreement and such engagement letter.
 Parent and the Shareholder Representative will have the opportunity
to present their positions with respect to such disputed items and amounts to
the CMS Dispute Arbitrator, and such disputed items and amounts shall be
finally resolved by the CMS Dispute Arbitrator.  The CMS Dispute Arbitrator
shall prepare a written report setting forth the resolution of the disputed
items and amounts and the final calculation of the Actual Net CMS
Reconciliation Amount and the CMS Reconciliation Payment Amount. Such report
of the CMS Dispute Arbitrator shall be delivered to Parent and the
Shareholder Representative as promptly as possible and the final
determination of the CMS Dispute Arbitrator of such disputed items and
amounts (and the Actual Net CMS Reconciliation Amount and the CMS
Reconciliation Payment Amount derived therefrom) and shall be final,
conclusive and binding upon each of the parties to this Agreement and shall
not be subject to appeal of any kind.  The fees and expenses of the CMS
Dispute Arbitrator shall be borne equally by Parent and the Shareholder
Representative. Each of Parent and MHRx shall provide all work papers, books
and records, employees and accountants that are requested by the CMS Dispute
Arbitrator in connection with the resolution of any such dispute.

  

(e) _Payments_. Subject to _Section 2.14_ , any payment due pursuant to this
_Section 2.12_ shall be paid within five (5) Business Days after the final
determination of such amount pursuant to this _Section 2.12_ (such date, the
" _CMS Reconciliation Payment Date_ ") and shall consist of (i) a number of
shares of Parent Common Stock (which in the case of shares being issued by
Parent shall have been registered under the Securities Act or be eligible to
be sold immediately pursuant to an effective registration statement in form
and substance reasonably acceptable to Parent and the Shareholder
Representative) equal to (A) forty-five percent (45%) of such payment amount
divided by (A) the Fair Market Value of a share of Parent Common Stock
(provided that if the Parent Common Stock is then traded on the

        



  

NASDAQ Global Select Market, such Fair Market Value shall be determined by
reference to the average of the high and low trading price of the Parent
Common Stock on a ten trailing day average basis for the last ten trading
days immediately preceding the CMS Reconciliation Payment Date) and (ii) the
remaining fifty-five percent (55%) of such payment shall be made by wire
transfer of immediately available funds to an account or accounts designated
by or on behalf of the party or parties receiving such payment; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that any Indemnifying Member that is obligated to make a payment
to Parent pursuant to this _Section 2.12_ may, at its election, pay its
Indemnification Percentage of such payment amount in cash by wire transfer of
immediately available funds. If Parent is required to make a payment to MHRx
pursuant to this _Section 2.12_ , such payment shall be made to
the Indemnifying Members to the extent that MHRx has distributed the right
to receive such payment to such Persons.

  

(f) _Tax Treatment_. Except to the extent that a portion of any payment made
pursuant to this _Section 2.12_ is required to be treated as imputed interest
under Section 483 of the Code, the parties will treat any such payment as an
adjustment to the Merger Consideration for Tax and financial reporting
purposes.

  

(g) For the avoidance of doubt, the CMS Reconciliation Payment Amount
calculated pursuant to _Section 2.12_ is not limited to the CMS
reconciliation required under 42 C.F.R 423.343, but includes the 2006 CMS
Reconciliation, Plan to Plan Post Reconciliation and State Claims Post
Reconciliation in connection with the Companys 2006 plan year. In addition,
any corollary true-up adjustments that would have been made in connection
with any agreements entered into by the Company, including but not limited to
NCPA Agreement and the Hannover Reinsurance Agreement, shall be considered in
calculating the CMS Reconciliation Payment Amount.

  

Section 2.13 _Contingent Payments_.

  

(a) _Additional Merger Consideration_. Subject to and upon the terms and
conditions of this Agreement, on each Earnout Payment Date, Parent shall pay
to MHRx as additional Merger Consideration the Annual Earnout Amount due with
respect to the immediately preceding Annual Earnout Period. Notwithstanding
the foregoing, Parent may, in its sole discretion, elect to pay to MHRx an
Annual Earnout Amount (or a portion thereof) despite the Annual EBITDA (or,
for the Annual Earnout Period ending December 31, 2010, the Annual EBITDA
plus the TRICARE Amount) being less than the EBITDA Threshold for such Annual
Earnout Period. Payments made pursuant to this _Section 2.13_ shall not be
subject to any right of setoff.

  

(b) _Annual Earnout Financials; Annual Earnout Statement; Dispute
Resolution_.

  

(i) As soon as practicable and in any event not later than ninety (90) days
after the last day of each Annual Earnout Period, Parent shall, at Parents
expense, prepare or cause to be prepared and delivered to the Shareholder
Representative an income statement of the MH Business for such immediately
preceding Annual Earnout Period (" _Annual Earnout Financials_ ") together
with a statement (each an " _Annual Earnout Statement_ ") setting forth in
reasonable detail

        

its determination (together with all supporting calculations) of Annual
EBITDA for such period and the Annual Earnout Amount, if any, for such
period, each such amount and all such statements to be prepared and
calculated in good faith and in accordance with the terms of this Agreement.
 In connection with the delivery of the Annual Earnout Financials and Annual
Earnout Statement relating to the final Annual Earnout Period ( _i.e_.,
January 1, 2010 through December 31, 2010), Parent shall also include as part
of such Annual Earnout Statement, a reasonably detailed calculation of the
TRICARE Amount calculated in good faith and in accordance with the terms of
this Agreement.

  

(ii) Parent shall provide the Shareholder Representative and its
representatives prompt and complete access to all of the work papers of
Parent and its representatives relating to the preparation of the Annual
Earnout Financials and each Annual Earnout Statement and access to all other
books and records, employees and accountants of Parent and its Subsidiaries
as may be reasonably requested by the Shareholder Representative in
connection with its review of such Annual Earnout Financials and
Annual Earnout Statements; _provided_ that Parent shall only be required
to exercise its commercially reasonable efforts to require its accountants
to provide the Shareholder Representative with access to such accountants
work papers. If the Shareholder Representative determines that any Annual
Earnout Financials or Annual Earnout Statements (or any Annual Earnout Amount
or TRICARE Amount, if applicable, reflected thereon) has not been prepared or
calculated in accordance with this Agreement, the Shareholder Representative
shall be entitled to deliver a notice of disagreement (an " _Earnout
Disagreement Notice_ ") to Parent within 60 days of its receipt of such
Annual Earnout Financials and Annual Earnout Statement. Each Earnout
Disagreement Notice shall set forth in reasonable detail those items or
amounts set forth in such Annual Earnout Financials and/or Annual Earnout
Statement as to which the Shareholder Representative disagrees and the
reasons for such disagreement. If no Earnout Disagreement Notice is
delivered within such 60-day period, such Annual Earnout Financials and
Annual Earnout Statement (and each calculation of the Annual Earnout
Amount and/or TRICARE Amount, as applicable, reflected thereon) shall become
final, conclusive and binding on the parties hereto for all purposes of this
_Section 2.13_ as of 5:00 p.m. (New York City time) on such 60th day, or, if
earlier, upon the Shareholder Representatives written acceptance of the
Annual Earnout Financials and Annual Earnout Statement (including each
calculation of the Annual Earnout Amount and/or TRICARE Amount, as
applicable, reflected thereon).

  

(iii) If the Shareholder Representative delivers an Earnout Disagreement
Notice to Parent within the 60-day period described above, the parties shall
use their good faith, commercially reasonable efforts to reach agreement on
the disputed items or amounts in order to finalize such Earnout Financial
Statements and determine the Annual Earnout Amount for such period (including
the TRICARE Amount, if applicable) during the thirty (30) day period
following the delivery of such Earnout Disagreement Notice by submitting such
dispute to a panel consisting of the MHRx Representative, the Parent

        

Representative and Charles E. Hallberg (the " _Dispute Panel_ "). The Dispute
Panel shall attempt to resolve such disputed items and amounts in good faith
including, if necessary, by conducting not less than two in person meetings
to discuss such dispute. If the Dispute Panel does not resolve all such
disputed items or amounts set forth in the Earnout Disagreement Notice within
such thirty (30) day period, Parent and the Shareholder Representative shall
retain an appraisal or valuation firm of national reputation that is mutually
acceptable to Parent and the Shareholder Representative (the " _Arbitrator_
") pursuant to a customary engagement letter proposed by the Arbitrator
and reasonably acceptable to Parent and the Shareholder Representative and
submit all such disputed items and amounts to the Arbitrator for final
resolution of such disputed items and amounts in accordance with the terms of
this Agreement and such engagement letter. Parent and the Shareholder
Representative will have the opportunity to present their positions with
respect to such disputed items and amounts to the Arbitrator, and such
disputed items and amounts shall be finally resolved by the Arbitrator. The
Arbitrator shall prepare a written report setting forth the resolution of the
disputed items and amounts and the final calculation of the disputed Annual
Earnout Amount (including the TRICARE Amount, if applicable). Such report of
the Arbitrator shall be delivered to Parent and the
Shareholder Representative as promptly as possible and the final
determination of the Arbitrator of such disputed items and amounts (and such
Annual Earnout Amount (including the TRICARE Amount, if applicable) derived
therefrom) and shall be final, conclusive and binding upon each of the
parties to this Agreement and shall not be subject to appeal of any kind.
 The fees and expenses of the Arbitrator shall be borne by Parent; _provided_
, that MHRx shall pay all such fees and expenses in the event that the Annual
Earnout Amount (including the TRICARE Amount, if applicable) proposed by
Parent are, in the aggregate, greater than or not more than $1,000,000 less
than the final amounts as determined by the Arbitrator.  Each of Parent and
the Shareholder Representative shall provide all work papers, books and
records, employees and accountants that are requested by the Arbitrator in
connection with the resolution of any such dispute.

  

(iv) Subject to _Section 2.14_ , any payments required to be made pursuant to
this _Section 2.13_ shall be paid by Parent to MHRx (or its members, if the
right to receive such payment has been distributed to such Persons by MHRx),
within five (5) Business Days after the final determination of such amount
pursuant to this _Section 2.13_  (each an " _Earnout Payment Date_ ") and
shall consist of (i) a number of shares of Parent Common Stock that have been
registered under the Securities Act (or which are eligible to be sold
immediately pursuant to an effective registration statement in form and
substance reasonably acceptable to Parent and the Shareholder Representative)
equal to (A) forty-five percent (45%) of such payment amount divided by (B)
the Fair Market Value of a share of Parent Common Stock (provided that if the
Parent Common Stock is then traded on the NASDAQ Global Select Market, such
Fair Market Value shall be determined by reference to the average of the high
and low trading price of the Parent Common Stock on a ten trailing day
average basis for the last ten trading days of the immediately preceding
Annual Earnout Period to which such payment

        

relates) and (ii) the remaining fifty-five percent (55%) of such payment
shall be made by wire transfer of immediately available funds to an account
or accounts designated by the Shareholder Representative.

  

(c) _Operations of the MH Business; Certain Principles of Allocation_.  The
parties agree that at all times during the period from the date hereof
through December 31, 2010 the MH Business shall be conducted in accordance
with the following principles and the financial statements required to be
prepared and calculations required to be made pursuant to this _Section 2.13_

reasonable manner.

  

(ii) Parent shall provide the Shareholder Representative with reasonable
access to the books, records and employees of the MH Business and use its

the MHRx Representative informed on a reasonably current basis of all
material developments relating to the MH Business including by making
available to the MHRx Representative within a reasonable period of time prior
to the implementation thereof, all operating budgets for the MH Business and
by making the Parent Representative available to the Shareholder
Representative to discuss such operating budgets.

  

(iii) All expenses relating to the MH Business and any other business
conducted by Parent and its Subsidiaries shall be allocated by Parent in good
faith among such businesses in a fair and reasonable manner and in a manner
consistent past practice and other allocations of expense by Parent to its
different business lines for other purposes; _provided_ , that (A) with
respect to the Part D Business, if during any relevant period Parent provides
any services to the MH Business that are being provided by a third party on
the date hereof, the costs of such services shall be allocated on a variable
cost basis in order to provide the MH Business the benefits of any synergies
associated with in internalization of such expenses; (B) items of income or
expense attributable to the operation of any portion of the MH Business that
is acquired by Parent after the Closing Date through the purchase of any
business enterprise, division or line of business (excluding, for the
avoidance of doubt, any CMS contracts acquired by novation) that would
otherwise be included within the calculation of Annual EBITDA shall be
excluded from the calculations contemplated by this _Section 2.13_ ; (C) if
Parent, the Company or any of their respective Subsidiaries sells, leases,
transfers or otherwise disposes of assets of the MH Business after the
Closing Date, Parent and the Shareholder Representative shall negotiate in
good faith and arrive at a fair and reasonable adjustment to the Annual
EBITDA calculation to reflect the impact of such disposition (and if unable
to agree thereon shall submit such matter to the Dispute Panel (and,
if necessary, the Arbitrator) for resolution, as soon as possible and,
if practicable, prior to the consummation of such transaction, on a
basis consistent with the procedures set forth in _Section_

        

 _2.13(b)(iii)_ ; (D) with respect to the Private Fee-for-Service Business,
Annual EBITDA shall be calculated on the basis of the premiums received for
such business _less_  direct expenses of such business, _less_ medical losses
calculated on a basis that is consistent with the company-wide loss ratio of
Parent and its Subsidiaries for such period and _less_ a fair and reasonable
good faith allocation of all indirect expenses; (E) expenses of integrating
the MH Business shall be included as expenses of the MH Business and (F)
costs and expenses related to the National Community Pharmacy Association
shall be included as expenses of the MH Business.

  

(d) _Tax Treatment_. Except to the extent that a portion of any payment made
pursuant to this _Section 2.13_ is required to be treated as imputed interest
under Section 483 of the Code, the parties will treat any such payment as an
adjustment to Merger Consideration for Tax and financial reporting purposes.

  

Section 2.14 _Certain Adjustments_. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary contained in _Section 2.12_ , _Section 2.13_ or _Section 8.2(e)_
, if Parent, MHRx or any Indemnifying Member is required to deliver any cash
or shares of Parent Common Stock to any other Person which would be treated
as an adjustment to the Merger Consideration pursuant to _Section 2.12(f)_ ,
_Section 2.13(d)_ or _Section 8.2(g)_ , the relative mix of such cash and
stock to be delivered shall be adjusted (i) if the cash and shares are
being delivered to MHRx or any Indemnifying Member, by increasing the shares
and decreasing the cash to be delivered or (ii) if the cash and shares are
being delivered to Parent, by decreasing the shares and increasing the cash
to be delivered, if necessary (and only to the extent necessary) so that,
after the delivery of such cash and shares, the Fair Market Value of all
Parent Shares included in the Merger Consideration (valued as of the trading
day immediately preceding the Closing Date) is in the aggregate not less than
40% of the total Merger Consideration (with all Parent Shares being valued at
their Fair Market Value as of the trading day immediately preceding the
Closing Date). In each case, the required cash payment will be adjusted up or
down to the extent necessary so that the total amount of such purchase price
adjustment (based on the valuation methodology for Parent Common Stock set
forth in _Section 2.12(e)_ , _Section 2.13(b)(iv)_ or _Section 8.2(e)_ , as
applicable) is not, in the aggregate, altered.

delivered to Parent true and complete copies of the Governing Documents of
MHRx and the Company and its Subsidiaries, as currently in effect. Neither
the Company nor any Subsidiary of the Company nor MHRx is in material
violation of or material default under the provisions of any such Governing

validly authorized, executed and delivered by Parent and each of the Merger
Subs), this Agreement is a valid and binding agreement of the Company and

its principal executive officer and principal financial officer, or persons
performing similar functions, as appropriate to allow timely decisions
regarding required disclosure and to make the certifications of the principal
executive officer and the principal financial officer of Parent required by
Sections 302 and 906 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act with respect to such reports.
For purposes of this Agreement, "principal executive officer" and "principal
financial officer" shall have the meanings given to such terms in the
Sarbanes-Oxley Act.  Each of the principal executive officer and the
principal financial officer of Parent (and each former principal executive
officer of Parent and each former principal financial officer of Parent, as
applicable) has made all certifications required by Sections 302 and 906 of
the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder
with respect to the Parent SEC Documents. Such "internal control
over financial reporting" provides reasonable assurances regarding the
reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial
statements, including that (A) transactions are executed in accordance with
managements general or specific authorization; and (B) transactions are
recorded as necessary (x) to permit preparation of consolidated financial
statements in conformity with GAAP and (y) to maintain accountability of the
assets of Parent and its Subsidiaries. The management of Parent has
disclosed, based on its most recent evaluation, to Parents auditors and the
audit committee of Parents board of directors (i) all
significant deficiencies in the design or operation of internal control over
financial reporting which could adversely affect Parents ability to record,
process, summarize and report financial data and have identified for Parents
auditors any material weaknesses in internal controls and (ii) any fraud,
whether or not material, that involves management or other employees who have
a significant role in Parents internal controls over financial reporting. A
summary of any such disclosure made by management to Parents auditors and
audit committee has been made available to the Company.

  

Section 4.7 _No Undisclosed Liabilities_. Neither Parent nor any of its
Subsidiaries has any liability other than (i) liabilities reflected in
consolidated balance sheet of Parent included in the Annual Report on Form
10-K for the fiscal year of Parent ended December 31, 2006 filed by Parent on
March 16, 2007 (including the related notes thereto) (the " _Latest Parent
Balance Sheet_ "), (ii) liabilities arising under Contractual Obligations
that are connected with future performance under such Contractual Obligations
and not required to be reflected on a

   

50  

   

consolidated balance sheet of Parent and its Subsidiaries prepared in
accordance with GAAP, (iii) liabilities that were incurred in the ordinary
course of business since the date of the Latest Parent Balance Sheet and (iv)
liabilities that have not had and would not reasonably be expected to have a
Parent Material Adverse Effect.

  

Section 4.8 _Title to Tangible Personal Property_. Parent or a Subsidiary of
Parent has good title to all of the tangible personal property reflected as
being owned by them on the Latest Parent Balance Sheet, in each case, free
and clear of Liens (other than Permitted Liens), except for any such assets
which have been sold or otherwise disposed of since the date of the Latest
Parent Balance Sheet or where the failure to have such good title has not had
and would not reasonably be expected to have a Parent Material Adverse
Effect. Parent and its Subsidiaries own or lease all tangible assets
necessary for the conduct of their business as presently conducted except
where such failure to own or lease has not had and would not reasonably be
expected to have a Parent Material Adverse Effect.

  

Section 4.9 _Absence of Certain Developments_. Except as set forth on
_Schedule 4.9_ , during the period beginning on the date of the Latest
Balance Sheet and ending on the date of this Agreement, (a) there has not
been any change, event or effect that has had or would reasonably be expected
to have a Parent Material Adverse Effect and (b) each of Parent and its
Subsidiaries has conducted its business in the ordinary course substantially
consistent with past practices. Without limiting the generality of the
foregoing, except as set forth on _Schedule 4.9_ , none of Parent or any of
its Subsidiaries has taken any action that would have constituted a violation
of _Section 5.3(b)_ of this Agreement if _Section 5.3(b)_ had been in effect
at all times since the date of the Latest Parent Balance Sheet.

  

Section 4.10 _Governmental Authorizations; Licenses; Etc_. Except as set
forth on _Schedule 4.10_ , the business of each of Parent and its
Subsidiaries is now and has been at all times since January 1, 2005 operated
in compliance with all applicable Legal Requirements, except where failure to
so comply has not had and would not reasonably be expected to have a Parent
Material Adverse Effect. Parent is, and has been since the effective date
thereof, in compliance in all material respects with the provisions of the
Sarbanes-Oxley Act applicable to it. Except as set forth on _Schedule
4.10_, each of Parent and its Subsidiaries has all permits, licenses,
approvals, certificates, Governmental Authorizations, and has made all
notifications, registrations, certifications and filings with all
Governmental Authorities, necessary or advisable for the operation of its
business as currently conducted, in each case except as has not had and would
not reasonably be expected to have a Parent Material Adverse Effect.
Except as set forth on _Schedule 4.10_ , all such permits, licenses,
approvals, certificates and Governmental Authorizations are in full force and
effect. Except as set forth on _Schedule 4.10_ , there is no action, audit,
case, proceeding or investigation pending or, to Parents Knowledge,
threatened in writing by any Governmental Authority with respect to (i) any
alleged violation by Parent or any of its Subsidiaries of any Legal
Requirement, (ii) any alleged failure by Parent or any of its Subsidiaries to
have any permit, license, approval, certification or other authorization
required in connection with the operation of the business of Parent and its
Subsidiaries or (iii) any change or amendment to the permits, licenses,
approvals, certifications or other authorizations which would impair the
ability of Parent and/or its Subsidiaries to operate in the normal course, in
each case except as has not had and would not reasonably be expected to
have a Parent Material Adverse Effect. This _Section 4.10_ does not relate
to matters with respect to Taxes (which are the subject

4.13_ ), Employee Matters (which are the subject of  _Section 4.14_) or

are no judgments, decrees, lawsuits, actions, proceedings,
claims, complaints, injunctions or orders by or before any Governmental
Authority pending or, to Parents Knowledge, threatened in writing or, to
Parents Knowledge, any pending investigation by any Governmental Authority,
in any such case, against Parent or any of its Subsidiaries which have had or
would reasonably be expected to have a Parent Material Adverse Effect.

Returns that Parent or any of its Subsidiaries is or may be subject to
taxation by that jurisdiction;

  

(v) the unpaid Taxes of Parent and its Subsidiaries did not, as of December
31, 2006, exceed the reserve for Taxes (rather than any reserve for deferred
Taxes established to reflect timing differences between GAAP and Tax income)
set forth on the face of the Latest Parent Balance Sheet. Parent and its

        

Subsidiaries have paid all estimated Taxes required to be paid for Parents,
and each of its Subsidiaries, current taxable year; and

in any plant closing or employee layoff activities since January 1, 2005 that
would violate or give rise to an obligation to provide any notice required

amended, or any similar state or local plant closing or mass layoff statute,
rule or regulation.

  

Section 4.14 _Employee Benefit Plans_. Each Parent Employee Benefit Plan has
been maintained and administered in compliance in all material respects with
the applicable requirements of ERISA, the Code and any other applicable
Legal Requirements.

  

Section 4.15 _Intellectual Property Rights_.

  

(a) Except as set forth on _Schedule 4.15(a)_ , Parent and its Subsidiaries
own all right, title and interest in, free and clear of all Liens, or have a
license or other right to use, all of the material Intellectual Property
Rights necessary for the conduct of the business of Parent and its
Subsidiaries as currently conducted (collectively, the " _Parent Intellectual
Property Rights_ ").

  

(b) To Parents Knowledge, the Parent Intellectual Property Rights are valid
and enforceable by Parent and/or its Subsidiaries. Except as has not had
and would not reasonably be expected to have a Parent Material Adverse
Effect, there is not pending against Parent or any of its Subsidiaries or, to

Knowledge, threatened assertion or claim and there has been no such assertion
or claim in the

Subsidiaries infringe upon or misappropriate in any way the material
Intellectual Property Rights of any Person.

  

Section 4.16 _Contracts_.   _Schedule 4.16_ sets forth a list of all
contracts, agreements, leases, permits or licenses that would be required to
be filed by Parent as of the date hereof as a "material contract" pursuant to
Item 601(b)(10) of Regulation S-K under the Securities Act (the " _Parent
Contracts_ "). Each Contractual Obligation of Parent is a valid and binding
agreement of Parent or its Subsidiary, as the case may be, and, to Parents
Knowledge, of the other parties thereto, enforceable by Parent or its
Subsidiary against the other party thereto in accordance with its
terms (subject to applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization,
moratorium or other laws affecting generally the enforcement of creditors
rights and subject to general principles of equity). Except as has not had
and would not reasonably be expected to have a Parent Material Adverse
Effect, (A) neither Parent nor any of its Subsidiaries or, to

Obligation of Parent (and no event has occurred which with notice or lapse of
time would constitute such breach, violation or default) and (B) neither

customary and adequate for companies of similar size and operating in the
same industry as Parent and its Subsidiaries, and such insurance policies are
in full force and effect and were in full force and effect during the periods
of time such insurance policies are purported to be in effect and all
premiums due with respect to all such policies have been paid.

  

Section 4.18 _Real Property_.

  

(a) Each material lease or sublease of real property to which Parent or any
of its Subsidiaries is a party or by which it is bound (each a " _Parent
Lease_ ", and collectively the " _Parent Leases_ ") is a valid and binding
agreement of Parent or its Subsidiary, as the case may be, and, to Parents
Knowledge, of the other parties thereto, enforceable in accordance with its
terms (subject to applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization,
moratorium or other laws affecting generally the enforcement of creditors
rights and subject to general principles of equity). Except as set forth on
_Schedule 4.18(a)_ , (A) neither Parent nor any of its Subsidiaries or, to

(and no event has occurred which with notice or lapse of time would
constitute such material breach, violation or default) and (B) neither Parent
nor any of its Subsidiaries has received written notice of any such material
breach, violation or default under any such Parent Lease.  Parent has made
available to the Company true and complete copies of all Parent Leases,

memoranda of lease, estoppel certificates and subordination, non-disturbance
and attornment agreements related thereto.

Section 4.19 _Transactions With Affiliates_. Except as set forth on _Schedule
4.19_ or as described in Parent SEC Documents filed prior to the date
hereof, and except pursuant to the Transactions, no director or executive
officer of Parent or of any of its Subsidiaries (or, to Parents knowledge,
any family member of any such Person who is an individual or any entity in
which any such Person or any such family member owns a material beneficial
interest) or any Person owning 5% of more of Parent Common Stock (i) is
involved in any material business arrangement or relationship with Parent or
any of its Subsidiaries other than employment arrangements and severance
arrangements entered into in the ordinary course of business or (ii) owns any
material property or right, tangible or intangible, which is used by Parent
or any of its Subsidiaries.

  

Section 4.20 _Financing_. Parent has received a commitment letter, dated as
of May 7, 2007 (the " _Debt Commitment Letter_ "), from Bank of America, N.A.
(the " _Lender_ "), pursuant to which the Lender has committed, subject to
the terms and conditions set forth therein, to provide up to $500,000,000 in
senior secured debt financing (the " _Debt Financing_ "). In addition, Parent
has entered into a Securities Purchase Agreement, dated as of May 7, 2007
(the " _Securities Purchase Agreement_ " and, together with the Debt
Commitment Letter, the " _Financing Documents_ "), with the investors party
thereto (the " _Equity Financing Sources_ "), pursuant to which the Equity
Financing Sources have agreed, subject to the terms and conditions set forth
therein, to provide to Parent up to an aggregate of $250,000,000 in equity
financing. True, accurate and complete copies of the Financing Documents and
the Other Securities Purchase Agreement, each as in effect on the date of
this Agreement, have been furnished to the Company. All of the representations
and warranties of Parent contained in the Securities Purchase Agreement and
Other Securities Purchase Agreement are true and correct.  The financing
contemplated by the Financing Documents (the " _Financing_ ") is sufficient
for Parent and Merger Subs to consummate the Transactions on the Closing Date
and pay the Initial Cash Merger Consideration and all related fees and
expenses. For the avoidance of doubt, Parent acknowledges and agrees that its
obligations to effect the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and pay
the Merger Consideration are not subject to its having received the proceeds
of the Debt Financing. As of the date hereof, (A) none of the Financing
Documents has been amended or modified, and (B) the respective financing
commitments contained in the Financing Documents have not been withdrawn or
rescinded in any respect.  Each of the Financing Documents, in the form so
delivered, is in full force and effect and is a legal, valid and binding
obligation of Parent and, to Parents Knowledge, the other parties thereto.
 As of the date hereof and assuming the accuracy of all representations and
warranties of the Company in this Agreement, no event has occurred
which, with or without notice, lapse of time or both, would constitute a
default or breach on the part of Parent under any term or condition of the
Financing Documents. As of the date hereof and assuming the accuracy of all
representations and warranties of the Company in this Agreement and
compliance by the Company with its agreements hereunder, Parent has no reason
to believe that it will be unable to satisfy on a timely basis any term or
condition of closing to be satisfied by it contained in the
Financing Documents. Parent has fully paid, or caused to be fully paid, any
and all commitment and other fees required by the terms of the Financing
Documents to be paid on or before the date hereof.

  

Section 4.21 _Information Supplied_. The information included or incorporated
by reference or to be included or incorporated by reference in the
Registration Statement (other than information supplied by the Company in
writing specifically for inclusion therein) shall not at

is supplemented or amended or at the time it becomes effective under the
Securities Act contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to
state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order
to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which
they are made, not misleading. The information included or incorporated by
reference or to be included or incorporated by reference in the Proxy

(or the Company), or on the Parent Shareholder Meeting Date, contain any
untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material
fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the
statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they are made,
not misleading.

Requirement or otherwise) to adopt this Agreement and to consummate the

taken all action necessary to ensure that any restrictions on business
combinations contained in the provisions of Section 912 of the New York
Business Corporation Law will not apply to the Transactions (including the
issuance of the Equity Financing Shares). No other "fair
price," "moratorium," "control share acquisition" or other similar anti-
takeover statute or regulation or any anti-takeover provision in Parents
Certificate of Incorporation or Bylaws is, or at the First Merger Effective
Time will be, applicable to Parent, the Transactions, the shares of Parent
Common Stock to be issued hereunder, the Equity Financing Shares to be issued
to the Equity Financing Sources, the Other SPA Shares or the Conversion
Shares.

  

Section 4.25 _Interim Operations of the Merger Subs_. Each Merger Sub was
formed by Parent solely for the purpose of engaging in the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, has engaged in no other business activities
and has conducted its operations only as contemplated by this Agreement.
Neither Merger Sub has any liabilities and, except for a subscription
agreement pursuant to which all of its authorized capital stock was issued to
Parent, neither of the Merger Subs is a party to any agreement other than
this Agreement and agreements with respect to the appointment of registered
agents and similar matters.

  

Section 4.26 _Brokers_. Except as set forth on _Schedule 4.26_ , no Person is

with this Agreement or the Transactions.

AGREEMENT (OR ANY ANCILLARY AGREEMENT CONTEMPLATED HEREBY) EXCEPT FOR THE
REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES MADE BY PARENT AND

        

THE MERGER SUBS IN THIS AGREEMENT, NONE OF PARENT, EITHER MERGER SUB NOR ANY

(a) The Company and Parent shall cooperate with each other and use (and shall
cause their respective Affiliates to use) their respective commercially
reasonable efforts to take or cause to be taken all actions, and to do or
cause to be done all things necessary, proper or advisable under all
applicable Contracts and Legal Requirements to consummate and make effective

promptly as practicable all documentation to effect all necessary notices,
reports and other filings and to obtain as promptly as practicable all
waivers, consents, registrations, approvals, permits and authorizations
necessary or advisable to be obtained from CMS and/or any other Governmental

Company and MHRx a reasonable opportunity to comment upon and modify any such
reference as to such Persons. Parents consent to accepting such comment or

(b) Parent shall (and shall cause its Affiliates to) offer to take (and if

eliminate impediments under

        

any antitrust, competition, or trade regulation Legal Requirement that may be
asserted by the FTC, the Antitrust Division or any other Governmental

deemed to require Parent to take any other action (including agreeing to any
requirements or conditions to be imposed in order to obtain CMS or insurance
regulatory consents or approvals, including those listed on _Schedule 6.1(b)_

(a) During the period beginning on the Closing Date and ending on the twelve-

Company and its Subsidiaries with compensation and compensation plans,
programs and arrangements that are no less favorable than the compensation

or shall cause the Company and its Subsidiaries to (i) waive all pre-

limitations, eligibility waiting periods and evidence of insurability
requirements under any New Plans to the extent waived or satisfied by an
employee under any Company Employee Benefit Plan as of the Closing Date, and
(ii) take into account, for purposes of satisfying applicable deductible,
coinsurance and maximum out-of-pocket provisions after the Closing Date under
any applicable New Plan, any covered expenses incurred on or before the

intended to confer upon any employee of the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries any rights to continue employment for any period.

  

(b) With respect to any Company Employee Benefit Plan listed on _Schedule
3.15(a)_ that is a "group welfare plan" within the meaning of Section 607 of

assigns, any legal or equitable rights hereunder.

        

Section 5.10 _Indemnification of Directors and Officers_.

  

(a) From and after the Closing Date, the Governing Documents of the Second
Merger Surviving Entity and its Subsidiaries shall contain provisions no less
favorable with respect to the limitation or elimination of liability and
indemnification than are set forth in the Governing Documents of the Company
and its Subsidiaries as of the date of this Agreement, which provisions shall
not be amended, repealed or otherwise modified for a period of six (6) years
after the Closing in any manner that would adversely affect the rights
thereunder of individuals who at or prior to the Closing were directors,

who were otherwise entitled to indemnification pursuant to the Governing
Documents of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries.

occurring on or prior to the Closing Date (including the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement) covering all persons who are currently
covered by the Companys existing officers and directors liability
insurance policies on terms no less advantageous to persons covered thereby
than those contained in such existing insurance policies; _provided_ , that
Parent and the Second Merger Surviving Entity shall not be required to pay an
amount for such tail policy that is in excess of $101,400 (which is equal to
300% of the last annual premium paid by the Company for its directors and
officers liability insurance); _provided_ ,  _further_ , that if such amount
is insufficient to procure the tail coverage contemplated by this _Section
5.10(b)_ , Parent shall, or shall cause the Second Merger Surviving Entity
to, after consultation with the Shareholder Representative, purchase as much
comparable insurance coverage as can be obtained for such amount.

  

(c) From and after the Closing Date, Parent shall, or Parent shall cause the
Second Merger Surviving Entity to, indemnify, hold harmless and defend each
individual who served as a director or officer of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries at any time prior to the Closing Date from and against all
actions, suits, proceedings, hearings, investigations, claims, etc.,
including all court costs and reasonable attorneys fees and expenses,
resulting from or arising out of acts or omissions (or alleged acts or
omissions) by them in their capacities as such, which acts or omissions
occurred at or prior to the Closing; _provided_ , _however_ , that the
indemnification obligations under this _Section 5.10(c)_ shall not be deemed
to eliminate or reduce the liability under _Article 8_  hereof of any
Indemnifying Member who also served as a director or officer of the Company
or any of its Subsidiaries prior to the Closing Date.

  

(d) The provisions of this _Section 5.10_ are (i) intended to be for the
benefit of, and shall be enforceable by, each Person entitled to
indemnification under this _Section 5.10_, and each such Persons heirs,
legatees, representatives, successors and assigns, it being expressly agreed
that such Persons shall be third-party beneficiaries of this _Section 5.10_
and (ii) in addition to, and not in substitution for, any other rights to
indemnification that any such Person may have by contact or otherwise.

  

(e) In the event Parent or the Second Merger Surviving Entity or any of their
respective successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any
other Person and is not

merger or (ii) transfers all or substantially all of its properties and
assets to any Person, proper provisions shall be made so that such Person
assumes the obligations set forth in this _Section 5.10_.

  

Section 5.11 _Certain Tax Matters; **** Plan of Reorganization_.

transfer, documentary, sales, use, stamp, registration and other such Taxes,
and all conveyance fees, recording charges and other fees and charges

consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement shall be paid
by Parent or the Second Merger Surviving Entity (otherwise, such fees and
charges shall be payable by the party incurring such expense).

on all Tax Returns that the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
qualify as a reorganization under Section 368(a) of the Code.

  

(c) If any Tax Return for the Company or any of its Subsidiaries for any Tax
period ending on or before the Closing is to be filed after the Closing Date,
Parent will provide a copy of such Tax Return to the Shareholder
Representative for its review and comment at least 15 days prior to filing
such Tax Return. All reasonable comments of the Shareholder Representative
will be incorporated in such Tax Return if such comments are consistent with
past practice as in effect immediately prior to the Closing Date, and if the
failure to incorporate such comments could reasonably be expected to have a
material adverse effect on any individual who was a shareholder or employee
of the Company immediately prior to the Closing Date. All other reasonable
comments of the Shareholder Representative will be considered in good faith
for inclusion in such Tax Return by the Company. Prior to the Closing,
Company shall advise Parent of the amount of any Tax withholding obligation
of the Company or any Subsidiary of the Company arising in connection with
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, which information the Parent
will rely upon for purposes of withholding from the Merger Consideration and
causing the Company to withhold as required.

  

(d) on or prior to the Closing Date, MHRx shall cause the Limited Liability
Company Agreement of MHRx LLC (the "LLC Agreement") to be amended to provide
that the proviso to Section 4.4(a)(B)(iii) of the LLC Agreement that was
added by Amendment No. 1 to the LLC Agreement will be amended to delete the
existing parenthetical: "(it being agreed by the Company and Charles E.
Hallberg that any such amounts distributable to Charles E. Hallberg shall be
treated as a guaranteed payment under Section 707(c) of the Code when paid)"
and to provide that any consideration received by Charles E. Hallberg with
respect to his Class D Units in excess of the pro rata consideration received
by other holders with respect to their Class D Units will be treated either
as a guaranteed payment by MHRx under Section 707(c) of the Code or as a
payment of compensation by the Company.

Shares) or to the ownership and voting of such securities and (ii) if any
such anti-takeover statute or similar statute or regulation becomes
applicable to the Transactions or to the ownership or voting of any such

execute and deliver to Parent, as promptly as practicable after the execution
of this Agreement, an Affiliate Agreement in the form attached hereto as

to time determine, in its sole discretion, to be necessary and desirable in

Member), and to pay such reserves or direct Parent to make payment of such
amounts to be applied to such reserves in lieu of the payment to MHRx or its

Agreement.

  

(b) _Actions Binding_. All decisions and actions by the
Shareholder Representative will be binding upon each holder of Company Common
Stock (including each Indemnifying Member) and no holder of Company Common
Stock will have the right to object, dissent, protest or otherwise contest
the same. Parent will be able to rely conclusively on the written
instructions of the Shareholder  Representative as to such decisions and
actions taken by the Shareholder Representative hereunder.

  

(c) _Liability_. The Shareholder Representative will not be liable for any
action taken by the Shareholder Representative in good faith pursuant to this

holders of Company Common Stock (including the Indemnifying Members) for any
and

        

all actions, liabilities, losses, damages, fines, penalties, fees, costs,
expenses or amounts paid in settlement (in each case, including reasonable
attorneys fees and expenses), whether or not involving a third party,
arising as a result of its serving as the Shareholder Representative,
including those incurred by the Shareholder Representative or the Affiliates
of the Shareholder Representative or any agents or representatives of the

Common Stock (including the Indemnifying Members) under this _Section
5.16(c)_ will be made free and clear of any present or future taxes,
deductions, charges or withholdings and all liabilities with respect thereto.
 The Shareholder Representative is serving in that capacity solely
for purposes of administrative convenience, and is not personally liable in
such capacity for any of the obligations of MHRx, the Company or the holders
of Company Common Stock (including the Indemnifying Members) hereunder and
Parent agrees that it will not look to the Shareholder Representative, acting

MHRx, the Company or the holders of Company Common Stock (including the
Indemnifying Members) hereunder.

Agreement any required withholding tax under Section 1445 of the Code.

and remedies available to it under the Financing Documents or otherwise
available to it. In the event any portion of the Equity Financing Sources
become unavailable on the terms and conditions contemplated in the Financing
Documents for any reason, Parent shall use its reasonable best efforts to
arrange to obtain alternative financing from alternative sources on terms not
materially less favorable in the aggregate to Parent as promptly
as practicable following the occurrence of such event. For purposes of this

_Indemnifying Member_ " and collectively, the " _Indemnifying Members_ ")
shall indemnify and hold harmless each of the Parent Indemnified Persons
from, against and in respect of such Indemnifying Members Indemnification
Percentage of any and all Losses (x) incurred or suffered by such Parent
Indemnified Persons as a result of any breach of, or inaccuracy in, any
representation or warranty made by the Company in Section _3.1_ (first
sentence only), _3.2_ , _3.5_ , _3.12_ , ** _3.15(i)_ , **_3.24_ , _3.25_ or
_3.26_  or (y) subject to indemnification under _Section 8.2(a)(iv)_ , in
either case, only to the extent the Parent Indemnified Persons cannot recover
such Losses from the Escrow Fund under _Section 8.2(a)_ as a result of
the Escrow Fund being insufficient to satisfy such Losses.**

  

(c) **_Indemnification by Parent_** **. Subject to the limitations set forth
in this _Article 8_ , from and after the Closing Date, Parent shall indemnify
and hold harmless each of the shareholders of the Company at the First Merger
Effective Time and each of the Indemnifying Members and each of their
respective direct and indirect Affiliates, officers, directors, members,**

   

80  

   

 **managers, partners, employees, agents and other representatives
(collectively, the " _MHRx Indemnified Persons_ "), from, against and in
respect of any and all Losses, incurred or suffered by such MHRx Indemnified
Persons as a result of**:

  

(i)  any breach of, or inaccuracy in, any representation or warranty made
by Parent or the Merger Subs in this Agreement or in any certificate
delivered pursuant to this Agreement;

  

(ii)  any material breach or violation of any covenant or agreement of
Parent or the Merger Subs pursuant to this Agreement; or

  

(iii) any material breach or violation of any covenant or agreement of the
Second Merger Surviving Entity after the Closing.

  

For the purposes of clause (i) of this _Section 8.2(c)_ , the representations
and warranties of Parent contained in Article 4 of this Agreement (other than
the first sentence of _Section 4.9_ ) shall be read as if all qualifications
as to materiality, including each reference to the terms and phrases
"material", "in all material respects" or like phrases, and the defined term
"Parent Material Adverse Effect", were deleted therefrom in determining
whether there has been a breach of any such representation or warranty.

  

(d) **_Limitations on Liability_**.

  

(i) Other than with respect to Losses subject to indemnification under
_Section 8.2(a)(iv)_ , neither the Parent Indemnified Persons nor the MHRx
Indemnified Persons shall be entitled to assert any claim for indemnification
under this _Article 8_ with respect to a single course of conduct or related
set of circumstances, occurrences or events unless the Losses arising
therefrom exceed $150,000 (any Losses in excess of such amounts being
referred to herein as " _Indemnifiable Losses_ ").

  

(ii) Other than with respect to Losses subject to indemnification under
_Section 8.2(a)(iii)_ or _Section 8.2(a)(iv)_ , neither the Parent
Indemnified Persons (in respect of _Sections 8.2(a)_ and _8.2(b)_ ) nor the
MHRx Indemnified Persons (in respect of _Section 8.2(c)_ ) shall be entitled
to assert any claim for indemnification hereunder until such time as the
aggregate of all Indemnifiable Losses that such Parent Indemnified Persons or
such MHRx Indemnified Persons may have under _Section 8.2(a)_ , _Section
8.2(b)_ or _Section 8.2(c)_ , as the case may be, exceed $10,000,000, and
then only for the amount by which such claims exceed such deductible amount.

  

(iii) The maximum liability of each Indemnifying Member for any Indemnified
Loss under _Section 8.2(b)_ shall not exceed the amount of such Indemnified
Loss multiplied by the Indemnification Percentage of such Indemnifying
Member. For purposes of this Agreement, " _Indemnification Percentage_ "
means a fraction, the numerator of which is such Indemnifying Members pro
rata share of the Initial Merger Consideration, and the denominator

        

of which is the aggregate Initial Merger Consideration payable to all
Indemnifying Members.

  

(iv) The maximum aggregate liability of all Indemnifying Members for
indemnification claims under _Sections 8.2(a)_  and _8.2(b)_ shall be limited
to the Purchase Price.

  

(v) The maximum aggregate liability of Parent for indemnification claims
under this _Article 8_ shall be limited to $31,500,000, except with respect
to indemnification under _Section 8.2(c)(i)_ in respect of breaches of the
representations and warranties contained in Sections _4.1_ (first sentence
only), _4.2_ , _4.5_ ,  _4.12_ , _4.22_ , _4.23_ , _4.24_ , _4.25_ and _4.26_
 (for which liability will be limited to an amount equal to the Purchase
Price).

  

(vi) The amount of Losses for which indemnification is available under this
_Article 8_ shall be calculated to appropriately take into account the amount
of Tax Benefits (as defined below) actually realized by the Person entitled
to seek indemnification hereunder (the " _Indemnified Person_ "), through (x)
a reduction in cash Tax payments required to be made by the Indemnified
Person or any of its Affiliates, (y) an offset against Taxes otherwise
actually payable in cash by the Indemnified Person or any of its Affiliates
or (z) the receipt of Tax refunds in cash by the Indemnified Person of any of
its Affiliates (collectively, " _Tax Benefits_ "), in each case, which Tax
Benefits result from, or arise from the same circumstances as, the Losses. If
the Indemnified Person is liable for any additional Taxes as a result of
the payment of amounts in respect of a Loss, the Indemnifying Party (as
defined below) will pay an additional amount such that the Indemnified Person
shall have received from the Indemnifying Party, net of the payment of Taxes,
an amount equal to the Loss. In addition, the amount of Losses for which
indemnification is available under this _Article 8_ shall be calculated net
of any amounts actually recovered by the Indemnified Person under insurance
policies with respect to such Losses. The Second Merger Surviving Entity shall
use commercially reasonable efforts to seek full recovery, to the fullest
extent possible, under all insurance policies covering any Losses to the same
extent as it would if such Losses were not subject to indemnification
hereunder, and the Second Merger Surviving Entity shall not take steps to
terminate or cancel any occurrence-based insurance policies of the Company in
effect for periods prior to the Closing. In the event that any party
required to provide indemnification under this _Article 8_ (the "
_Indemnifying Party_ ") makes any payment hereunder in respect of any Losses,
such Indemnifying Party shall be subrogated, to the extent of such payment to
the rights of such Indemnified Person against any insurer (to the extent
permitted under applicable insurance policies) or other third Persons with
respect to such Losses. In addition, the amount of Losses for which
indemnification is available under this _Article 8_ shall be net of all
related reserves reflected on the Latest Company Balance Sheet or the Latest
Parent Balance Sheet, as applicable, each as adjusted through the Closing
Date to give effect to the passage of time and, in respect of Losses subject
to indemnification under Section _8.2(a)_ or _8.2(b)_  relating to Taxes, net
of any

        

Indemnifiable Tax Benefits (as defined below) actually realized by Parent or
any of its Affiliates with respect to any net operating losses available to
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries as of the close of business on
December 31, 2006; it being understood that to the extent that Parent or any
of its Affiliates actually realize any such Indemnifiable Tax Benefit after
receiving an indemnification payment for any Losses relating to Taxes, Parent
shall remit to the Shareholder Representative an amount equal to the amount
of any such Indemnifiable Tax Benefit to the extent that the amount of such
Indemnifiable Tax Benefit does not exceed the cumulative indemnification
payments relating to Taxes received by Parent and any of its Affiliates and
not previously offset by Indemnifiable Tax Benefits. An " _Indemnifiable
Tax Benefit_ " shall mean any Tax Benefit or Tax Benefits relating to
net operating losses, that alone exceeds or in the aggregate exceed $150,000,
it being understood that the full amount of any Indemnifiable Tax
Benefit, including the amount below $150,000, shall be recoverable by the
Shareholder Representative as provided in this _Section 8.2(d)(vi)_. After
the Closing, upon and after becoming aware of any event or circumstance that
could reasonably be expected to give rise to any Losses with respect to which
indemnification may be required hereunder, the Parent Indemnified Persons or
MHRx Indemnified Persons, as the case may be, will use their commercially
reasonable efforts to mitigate all Losses pursuant to which indemnification
is available hereunder (including, with respect to any claim based on a
breach of the representation set forth in _Section 3.12(l)_ , by first
pursuing any rights against Persons receiving the compensation for which
withholdings were not made prior to making any indemnification claim
hereunder).

  

(vii) No party will in any event be liable under this _Article 8_ , and no
claim for indemnification may in any event be asserted under this _Article 8_
, for any loss of profits or earnings, or any punitive, indirect, incidental
or consequential damages by reason of a breach of any representation,
warranty, covenant or indemnity contained herein;  _provided_ _that_ the
foregoing is not intended to limit recovery of amounts paid by an Indemnified
Person in connection with the defense, settlement or other resolution of any
Third Party Claim (including any punitive, indirect, incidental or
consequential damages paid by an Indemnified Person to any third party).

  

(viii) For the avoidance of doubt, in no event will any Indemnifying Member
have any indemnification obligation under this _Section 8.2_ relating to
Taxes on the Reserve Adjusted Net CMS Reconciliation Amount received by the
Company.

  

(e) _Payment of Claims_.

  

(i) Subject to _Section 2.14_ , if _Section 8.2(a)_ requires that an
Indemnifiable Loss be satisfied from the Escrow Fund, (i) a total number of
Escrow Shares equal to the lesser of (x) the total number of Escrow Shares
remaining in the Escrow Fund and (y) a number of Escrow Shares determined by
dividing 45% of such Indemnifiable Loss by the Fair Market Value of a share
of

        

Parent Common Stock (provided that if the Parent Common Stock is then traded
on the NASDAQ Global Select Market, such Fair Market Value shall be
determined by reference to the average of the high and low trading price of
the Parent Common Stock on a ten trailing day average basis for the last ten
trading days immediately preceding the date such Indemnifiable Loss became
payable under _Section 8.2(a)_ and (ii) Escrow Cash, in an amount equal to
the lesser of (x) the amount of Escrow Cash remaining in the Escrow Fund and
(y) such amount of the Indemnifiable Loss that is not paid in Escrow Shares
pursuant to clause (i) above (valued as provided above), shall be paid from
the Escrow Fund to Parent. Subject to _Section 2.14_ , to the extent that the
amount of Escrow Shares or Escrow Cash remaining in the Escrow Fund
is insufficient to pay the portion of an Indemnifiable Loss pursuant to
clause (i) or clause (ii), as the case may be, of the previous sentence in
its entirety, and Escrow Shares or Escrow Cash remain in the Escrow Fund at
such time, the remaining Escrow Shares or Escrow Cash shall be used to
satisfy the remainder of such Indemnifiable Loss.

  

(ii) Subject to _Section 2.14_ , if _Section 8.2(b)_ or _Section 8.2(c)_
requires that an Indemnifiable Loss be satisfied other than from the Escrow
Fund, such Indemnifiable Loss shall be satisfied by means of the delivery to
the Indemnified Person of (i) a total number of shares of Parent Common Stock
determined by dividing 45% of such Indemnifiable Loss by the Fair Market
Value of a share of Parent Common Stock (provided that if the Parent Common
Stock is then traded on the NASDAQ Global Select Market, such Fair Market
Value shall be determined by reference to the average of the high and low
trading price of the Parent Common Stock on a ten trailing day average basis
for the last ten trading days immediately preceding the date
such Indemnifiable Loss became payable under _Section 8.2(b)_ or
_Section 8.2(c)_ , as applicable), and (ii) cash (by wire transfer of
immediately available funds to an account or accounts designated by the
Indemnified Person, in an amount equal to such amount of the Indemnifiable
Loss that is not paid in shares of Parent Common Stock; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that any Indemnifying Member that is obligated to make an
indemnification payment to Parent pursuant to _Section 8.2(b)_ may, at its
election, pay more than 55% of such payment amount by wire transfer of
immediately available funds. In the event that Parent or any other Parent
Indemnified Person proposes to make any claim for indemnification pursuant to
_Section 8.2(b)_ , the Indemnified Person making the claim shall give notice
to the Shareholder Representative (which notice shall be given, as soon as
reasonably practical after the Parent Indemnified Person determines in good
faith that it is entitled to bring such claim). Any such notice shall describe
the facts giving rise to the claim in reasonable detail (in light of the
circumstance known at the time).

  

(f) _Third Party Claims_.

  

(i) _Notice of Claim_. If any third party notifies an Indemnified Person with
respect to any matter (a " _Third Party Claim_ ") which may give rise to a
claim for indemnification against an Indemnifying Party, then the Indemnified
Person will promptly (and, in any event, within twenty (20) Business Days)
give written

        

notice thereof to the Indemnifying Party; _provided_ , that no delay on the
part of the Indemnified Person in notifying the Indemnifying Party will
relieve the Indemnifying Party from any obligation under this _Article 8_ ,
except to the extent such delay actually and materially prejudices the
Indemnifying Party.

  

(ii) _Assumption of Defense, etc_. The Indemnifying Party will be entitled
to participate in the defense of any Third Party Claim that is the subject of
a notice given by the Indemnified Person pursuant to _Section 8.2(f)(i)_. In
addition, upon written notice to the Indemnified Person, the Indemnifying
Party will have the right to defend the Indemnified Person against the Third
Party Claim with counsel of its choice reasonably satisfactory to the
Indemnified Person, except in the case of Third Party Claims involving Taxes
under the special circumstances described in clause (v) below in which such
clause (v) shall govern. In such event, the Indemnified Person may retain
separate co-counsel at its sole cost and expense and participate in
the defense of the Third Party Claim.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, the
Indemnifying Party will not consent to the entry of any judgment or enter
into any compromise or settlement with respect to the Third Party Claim
without the prior written consent of the Indemnified Person unless such
judgment, compromise or settlement (a) provides for the payment by the
Indemnifying Party of money as sole relief for the claimant and (b) results
in the full and general release of all Indemnified Persons from all
liabilities arising or relating to, or in connection with, the Third Party
Claim. For the avoidance of doubt, any amounts incurred in connection with
the defense, settlement or other resolution of any Third Party Claims shall
be deemed to be Losses for purposes of the limitations set forth in _Section
8.2(d)_.

  

(iii) _Indemnified Person s Control_. If the Indemnifying Party does not
deliver the notice contemplated by _Section 8.2(f)(ii)_ within twenty (20)
days after the Indemnified Person has given notice of the Third Party Claim
pursuant to _Section 8.2(f)(i)_ , the Indemnified Person may defend, and may
consent to the entry of any judgment or enter into any compromise or
settlement with respect to, the Third Party Claim; _provided_ , that the
Indemnifying Party will not be bound by the entry of any such judgment
consented to, or any such compromise or settlement effected, without its
prior written consent (which consent will not be unreasonably withheld or
delayed).

  

(iv) _Remedies Exclusive_. The parties agree that, except as
otherwise expressly provided in _Section 8.15_ , from and after the Closing
the remedies provided for in this _Article 8_ shall constitute the sole
and exclusive remedy for all Losses that any such party may suffer or incur
arising from or relating to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated
hereby and the parties hereto hereby waive any other rights or remedies that
may arise under any applicable Legal Requirements and any equitable remedies
(provided that the foregoing shall not be deemed to in any way limit the
rights or remedies of any MHRx Indemnified Person (or Affiliate thereof) who
is a participant in the Equity Financing under Securities Purchase Agreement
or any other documents or agreements relating thereto).

        

(v) _Certain Third Party Claims Involving Taxe_ s. If the Third Party Claim
involves a Tax dispute that (A) includes a Tax for which the Indemnified
Person could be liable but for which no indemnity is available hereunder, (B)
the amount of Tax at issue in clause (A) is larger than the Loss at issue
(taking into account any reasonably anticipated netting effects pursuant to
_Section 8.2(d)_  hereof), and (C) the two Tax issues cannot be segregated or
severed and defended separately, then, the Indemnified Person shall control
the defense of the Third Party Claim, although the Indemnifying Party shall
have the right to participate in such defense, including (with the
Indemnified Persons consent, not to be unreasonably withheld) the right to
participate on a face-to-face basis in any audit, administrative appeal,
court proceeding or settlement discussions, all at its own cost and expense.
 Subject to such continuing participation, the Indemnified Person
may consent to the entry of any judgment or enter into any compromise or
settlement with respect to the Third Party Claim; provided, that the
Indemnified Person and the Indemnifying Party shall consult in good faith
about any such judgment, compromise or settlement. If the parties are not
able to agree on the disposition of the Third Party Claim, the parties will
again attempt to sever from such Third Party Claim any dispute regarding any
Tax described in clause (A) of this clause (v). If such attempted severance
occurs, the Indemnifying Party will take over the defense of the Third Party
Claim. If such attempted severance does not occur, the Indemnified Person has
the ultimate right to decide on the disposition of the Third Party Claim,
provided that if the Indemnifying Party objects in writing to the judgment,
compromise, or settlement, then the Indemnifying Party may take over the
defense of the Third Party Claim, in which case the Indemnifying Party shall
be liable to the Indemnified Person for the full amount by which the
judgment, compromise or settlement exceeds the amount that would have been
obtained in the original judgment, compromise, or settlement (to which the
Indemnifying Party objected).  If the defense of the Third Party Claim
conducted by the Indemnifying Party results in a judgment, compromise or
settlement amount that is less than the amount that would have been obtained
in the original judgment, compromise or settlement (to which the Indemnifying
Party objected), then the Indemnifying Party may offset any Indemnifiable
Loss otherwise due to the Indemnified Person by the difference between such
amounts.  The principles of the foregoing procedures shall also apply to the
right to participation, defense and disposition of Third Party Claims in
which clauses (A) and (C) hereof apply (but not (B)). Other than with respect
to the foregoing provisions of this clause (v), the provisions of clauses
(i)-(iii) above shall govern.

  

 ** **(g) **** _Tax Treatment_. The parties will treat any payment received
pursuant to this Article 8 as an adjustment to the Merger Consideration for
Tax and financial reporting purposes to the extent permissible under
applicable Legal Requirements.

and of itself and solely by virtue of the inclusion of such information in
the Disclosure Schedules, that such information is required to be listed in
any Disclosure Schedule or that such items are material to any party hereto
or any of their respective Subsidiaries. The headings, if any, of the
individual sections of each of the Disclosure Schedules are inserted for
convenience

        

only and will not be deemed to constitute a part thereof or a part of the
Agreement. The Disclosure Schedules are arranged in sections and subsections
that correspond to the sections and subsections of this Agreement merely for
convenience, and the disclosure of an item in one section or subsection of
the Disclosure Schedules as an exception to a particular covenant,
representation or warranty will be deemed adequately disclosed as an
exception with respect to all other covenants, representations or warranties
herein to the extent that the relevance of such item to such other covenants,
representations or warranties is reasonably apparent on its face,
notwithstanding (x) the presence or absence in this Agreement of an
appropriate reference to the section or subsection of the Disclosure
Schedules, (y) the presence or absence in the Disclosure Schedules of an
appropriate reference to the section or subsection of this Agreement to which
such disclosure relates or (z) an appropriate cross-reference thereto.

  

Section 8.5 _Time of the Essence; Computation of Time_. Time is of the
essence for each and every provision of this Agreement.  Whenever the last
day for the exercise of any privilege or the discharge or any duty hereunder
shall fall upon a day that is not a Business Day, the party having such
privilege or duty may exercise such privilege or discharge such duty on the
next succeeding day which is a regular Business Day.

  

Section 8.6 _Expenses_. Except as otherwise set forth in this Agreement, and
subject to _Section 8.2(a)(iv)_ , regardless of whether the transactions
provided for in this Agreement are consummated, each party hereto shall pay
its own expenses incident to this Agreement; _provided_ , that if the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement are completed, at the Closing the
parties shall pay all Seller Transaction Expenses as directed by MHRx out of
the Initial Cash Merger Consideration (and the associated reduction of
the Initial Cash Merger Consideration by the amount of such fees and expenses
will be treated as an adjustment to the Cash Merger Consideration for Tax
and financial reporting purposes).

  

Section 8.7 _Governing Law_. All issues and questions concerning
the construction, validity, enforcement and interpretation of this Agreement
and the schedules and exhibits hereto shall be governed by, and construed
in accordance with, the laws of the State of New York without giving effect
to any choice of law or conflict of law rules or provisions that would cause
the application of the laws of any jurisdiction other than the State of New
York.

  

Section 8.8 _Jurisdiction and Venue; Waiver of Jury Trial_. Except as
otherwise provided in Sections _2.12_ and _2.13_ , each of the parties
submits to the exclusive jurisdiction of any state or federal court sitting
in New York, New York, in any action or proceeding arising out of or relating
to this Agreement, agrees that all claims in respect of the action or
proceeding may be heard and determined in any such court and agrees not to
bring any action or proceeding arising out of or relating to this Agreement
in any other court. Each of the parties waives any defense of inconvenient
forum to the maintenance of any action or proceeding so brought and waives
any bond, surety or other security that might be required of any other party
with respect thereto.  Each party agrees that service of summons and
complaint or any other process that might be served in any action or
proceeding may be made on such party by sending or delivering a copy of the
process to the party to be served at the address of the party and in the
manner provided for the giving of notices in _Section 8.3_. Nothing in this
_Section 8.8_ , however, shall affect the right of any party to serve legal
process in any other manner permitted by law. Each party agrees that a
final, non-appealable judgment in any action or proceeding so brought shall

        

be conclusive and may be enforced by suit on the judgment or in any other
manner provided by law. EACH OF THE PARTIES HERETO IRREVOCABLY WAIVES ANY AND
ALL RIGHTS TO TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY LEGAL PROCEEDING ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED
TO THIS AGREEMENT.

  

Section 8.9 _Assignment; Successors and Assigns; No Third Party Rights_.
 Except as otherwise provided herein, this Agreement may not, without
the prior written consent of the other parties hereto, be assigned by any
party hereto by operation of law or otherwise, and any attempted assignment
shall be null and void; _provided_ _that_ , without the consent of the
Company, Parent and Merger Sub shall be permitted to make a collateral
assignment of this Agreement to any financial institution and Merger Sub may
assign its rights hereunder to one or more wholly-owned Subsidiaries of
Parent or Merger Sub upon written notice of such assignment to the Company,
it being understood that no assignment of this Agreement shall relieve the
transferor of any of its obligations hereunder. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, no assignment shall be permitted that could reasonably be expected
to impact the tax treatment of the Mergers. Subject to the foregoing, this
Agreement shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the parties
hereto and their respective heirs, successors, permitted assigns and legal
representatives. Except as set forth in _Section 5.10_ , and except for the
rights of the holders of Certificates hereunder, this Agreement shall be for
the sole benefit of the parties to this Agreement and their respective heirs,
successors, permitted assigns and legal representatives and is not intended,
nor shall be construed, to give any Person, other than the parties hereto and
their respective heirs, successors, assigns and legal representatives, any
legal or equitable right, remedy or claim hereunder. Nothing in this
Agreement, expressed or implied, is intended to or shall constitute the
parties hereto partners or participants in a joint venture.

  

Section 8.10 _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed in one or
more counterparts for the convenience of the parties hereto, each of which
shall be deemed an original and all of which together will constitute one and
the same instrument. Delivery of an executed counterpart of a signature page
to this Agreement by facsimile or other electronic delivery shall be
effective as delivery of a mutually executed counterpart to this Agreement.

  

Section 8.11 _Titles and Headings_. The titles, captions and table of contents
in this Agreement are for reference purposes only, and shall not in any
way define, limit, extend or describe the scope of this Agreement or
otherwise affect the meaning or interpretation of this Agreement.

  

Section 8.12 _Entire Agreement_. This Agreement (including the schedules
and exhibits attached hereto), the Parent Confidentiality Agreement and the
Company Confidentiality Agreement constitute the entire agreement among the
parties with respect to the matters covered hereby and supersedes all
previous written, oral or implied understandings among them with respect to
such matters.

  

Section 8.13 _Severability_. The invalidity of any portion hereof shall not
affect the validity, force or effect of the remaining portions hereof. If it
is ever held that any restriction hereunder is too broad to permit
enforcement of such restriction to its fullest extent, such restriction shall
be enforced to the maximum extent permitted by law.

Section 8.14 _No Strict Construction_. Each of the parties hereto acknowledges
that this Agreement has been prepared jointly by the parties hereto, and
shall not be strictly construed against any party.

  

Section 8.15 _Specific Performance_. Each of the parties acknowledges that
the rights of each party to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby
are unique and recognize and affirm that in the event of a breach of this
Agreement by any party, money damages may be inadequate and the non-breaching
party may have no adequate remedy at law.  Accordingly, the parties agree
that such non-breaching party shall have the right, in addition to any other
rights and remedies existing in their favor at law or in equity, to enforce
their rights and the other partys obligations hereunder by an action or
actions for specific performance, injunctive and/or other equitable relief
(without posting of bond or other security).

  

Section 8.16 _Failure or Indulgence not Waiver_. No failure or delay on the
part of any party hereto in the exercise of any right hereunder shall impair
such right or be construed to be waiver of, or acquiescence in, any breach of
any representation, warranty or agreement herein, nor shall any single or
partial exercise of any such right preclude any other or further exercise
thereof or any other right. No provision of this Agreement may be waived
except by an instrument in writing executed by the party or parties, as
applicable, against whom the waiver is to be effective.

  

Section 8.17 _Amendments_. Subject to applicable law, this Agreement may be
amended by the parties hereto by action taken by or on behalf of
their respective Boards of Directors (or similar governing body) at any time
prior to the Closing. This Agreement (including the provisions of this
_Section 8.17_ ) may not be amended or modified except by an instrument in
writing signed on behalf of the parties hereto.
