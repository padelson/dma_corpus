THIS AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER (the " _Agreement_ ") is made and entered
into as of December 13, 2016, between SOUTHERN NATIONAL BANCORP OF VIRGINIA,
INC., a Virginia corporation (" _SONA_ "), and EASTERN VIRGINIA BANKSHARES,
INC., a Virginia corporation (" _EVBS_ ").

  



  

WHEREAS, the Boards of Directors of SONA and EVBS have unanimously approved,
and deem it advisable and in the best interests of their
respective shareholders to consummate, the business combination transaction
provided for herein in which EVBS will merge with and into SONA (the "
_Merger_ ");

  



  

WHEREAS, the Boards of Directors of EVBS and SONA have each determined that
the Merger is consistent with and will further their respective business
strategies and goals; and

  



  

WHEREAS, it is the intention of the parties that, for federal income tax
purposes, the Merger shall qualify as a "reorganization" within the meaning
of Section 368(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "
_Code_ "), and that this Agreement shall constitute, and is adopted as, a
"plan of reorganization" for purposes of Sections 354 and 361 of the Code.

  



  

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing and the respective
representations, warranties, covenants and agreements set forth herein,
and intending to be legally bound hereby, the parties agree as follows:

  



  

Article 1

(as defined in Section 1.3), EVBS will be merged with and into SONA pursuant
to the Plan of Merger, substantially in the form attached hereto as _Exhibit
1.1_ and made a part hereof (the " _Plan of Merger_ "). The
separate corporate existence of EVBS thereupon shall cease, and SONA will be
the surviving corporation in the Merger (SONA is referred to herein as the "
_Continuing Corporation_ " whenever reference is made to it as of the
Effective Date or thereafter). The Merger will have the effect set forth in
Section 13.1-721 of the VSCA.

Alston and Bird LLP, 1201 West Peachtree Street, Atlanta, Georgia on a date
mutually agreed to by the parties, which shall be no later than the third
(3rd) business day following the satisfaction or waiver in accordance with
this Agreement of all of the conditions set forth in Article 6 (other than
those conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied at the Closing, but
subject to the fulfillment or waiver of those conditions), or at such other
time and date as may be mutually agreed in writing by the parties

  



    



 



    



  

(the " _Closing Date_ "). All documents required by this Agreement to be
delivered at or prior to the Closing Date will be exchanged by the parties at
the Closing.

  



  

Section 1.3 _Effective Date_.

  



  

Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, as soon as practicable

(e) If, between the date hereof and the Effective Date, the
outstanding shares of SONA Common Stock or EVBS Common Stock shall have
been increased, decreased, changed into or exchanged for a different number
or kind of shares or securities as a result of a reorganization, stock
dividend, stock split, reverse stock split or similar change in
capitalization, appropriate and proportionate adjustments shall be made to

Section 2.2 _Election Procedures for EVBS Series B Preferred Stock_.

  



  

Prior to the date hereof, each holder of EVBS Series B Preferred Stock has
provided to SONA the Series B Voting Agreement and Election, which sets
forth such holders election to receive either the Continuing Corporation
Common Stock or the Continuing Corporation Non-Voting Common Stock, or a
combination thereof, as provided in Section 2.1(d). Prior to the Effective
Date, SONA shall provide the completed Series B Voting Agreement and
Elections to the Exchange Agent. A holder of EVBS Series B Preferred Stock may
revoke or change its election in accordance with the terms set forth in the
Series B Voting Agreement and Election no later than five (5) days prior to
the anticipated Effective Date or on such other date as SONA and EVBS shall
mutually agree (the " _Election Deadline_ "). In the event an election is
revoked prior to the Election Deadline, the shares of EVBS Series B Preferred
Stock represented by such Election Form shall become "No Election Shares,"
and the holders of such No Election Shares shall be deemed to have made
an election to receive the Continuing Corporation Common Stock, except to the
extent a subsequent election is properly made with respect to any or all of
such shares of EVBS Series B Preferred Stock prior to the Election Deadline.
Subject to the terms of this Agreement and of the Series B Voting Agreement
and Election, SONA shall have reasonable discretion to determine whether any
election, revocation or change has been properly or timely made and to
disregard immaterial defects in the Series B Voting Agreement and Election,
and any good faith decisions of SONA regarding such matters shall be binding
and conclusive. None of SONA, EVBS or the Exchange Agent shall be under any
obligation to notify any person of any defect in a Series B Voting Agreement
and Election.

  



  

Section 2.3 _Exchange Procedures_.

  



  

(a) Prior to the Effective Date, SONA shall appoint an exchange and
paying agent reasonably acceptable to EVBS (the " _Exchange Agent_ ") for the
payment and exchange of the Merger Consideration.

  



  

(b) At or promptly after the Effective Date, SONA shall for the
benefit of holders of shares of EVBS Common Stock and EVBS Series B
Preferred Stock and for exchange in accordance with this Article 2, (i)
deposit, or cause to be deposited, with the Exchange Agent an amount of cash
sufficient to pay the aggregate amount of cash payable pursuant to this
Article 2 in lieu of fractional shares of Continuing Corporation Common Stock
and Continuing Corporation Non-Voting Common Stock (the " _Exchange Fund_ "),
(ii) duly authorize and direct issuance by the Exchange Agent of non-
certificated shares represented by book-entry registry of
Continuing Corporation Common Stock payable pursuant to this Article 2, and
(iii) duly authorize and direct issuance by the Exchange Agent of
certificated shares of Continuing Corporation Non-Voting Common Stock payable
pursuant to this Article 2.

  



  

(c) SONA shall take all steps necessary to cause the Exchange Agent,
within five (5) business days after the Effective Date, to mail or deliver to
each holder of record of (i) an outstanding Certificate or outstanding
Certificates that immediately prior to the Effective Date represented
outstanding shares of EVBS Common Stock or EVBS Series B Preferred Stock (the
" _Certificates_ ") or (ii) uncertificated shares of EVBS Common Stock
represented by book-entry (" _Book-Entry Shares_ "), which in each case, were
converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration with respect
thereto pursuant to this Article 2, a letter of transmittal in customary form
for return to the Exchange Agent and instructions for use in effecting the
surrender of the Certificates and Book-Entry Shares for the Merger
Consideration into which the shares of such

  



    

 | 6| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

EVBS Common Stock and EVBS Series B Preferred Stock have been converted
pursuant to this Agreement. Such letter of transmittal shall permit each
holder of Certificates or Book-Entry Shares to elect to receive, in lieu of
shares of Continuing Corporation Common Stock or Continuing Corporation Non-
Voting Common Stock, as applicable, represented by book-entry registry, a
physical stock certificate representing shares of Continuing Corporation
Common Stock or Continuing Corporation Non-Voting Common Stock, as applicable,
payable pursuant to this Article 2.

  



  

(d) Upon the Effective Date, each holder of an outstanding share of
EVBS Common Stock and EVBS Series B Preferred Stock who has
properly surrendered such Certificates or Book-Entry Shares to the Exchange
Agent (or affidavits of loss in lieu of such Certificates), together with a
letter of transmittal, duly completed and validly executed in accordance with
the instructions thereto, and such other documents as the Exchange Agent may
reasonably require, (i) (x) the holder of such Certificate or Book-Entry Share
representing EVBS Common Stock will be entitled to evidence of issuance in
book-entry form the number of whole shares of Continuing Corporation Common
Stock (except if such holder has made an election to receive a physical stock
certificate pursuant to Section 2.3(c)) and (y) the holder of such
Certificate representing EVBS Series B Preferred Stock will be entitled to
receive a physical stock certificate for the number of whole shares of
Continuing Corporation Common Stock and/or Continuing Corporation Non-Voting
Common Stock elected by such holder pursuant to Section 2.2 and (ii) the
amount of cash, if any, into which the aggregate number of shares of EVBS
Common Stock or EVBS Series B Preferred Stock, as applicable, previously
represented by such Certificates or Book-Entry Shares surrendered shall have
been converted pursuant to this Agreement. The Exchange Agent shall not be
obligated to deliver the consideration to which any former holder of EVBS
Common Stock or EVBS Series B Preferred Stock is entitled as a result of the
Merger until such holder surrenders his, her or its Certificates or Book-
Entry Shares for exchange as provided in this Section 2.3. Any other
provision of this Agreement notwithstanding, neither the Continuing
Corporation nor the Exchange Agent shall be liable to a holder of EVBS Common
Stock or EVBS Series B Preferred Stock for any amounts paid or property
delivered in good faith to a public official pursuant to any applicable
abandoned property law.

  



  

(e) A holder of EVBS Common Stock or EVBS Series B Preferred Stock
whose Certificates have been lost, destroyed, stolen or are otherwise missing
shall be entitled to receive its portion of the Merger Consideration and
dividends or distributions to which such shareholder shall be entitled, if
any, upon compliance with reasonable conditions imposed by the Continuing
Corporation and the Exchange Agent pursuant to applicable law and as required
in accordance with the Continuing Corporation's and the Exchange
Agent's standard policy (including the requirement that the shareholder
furnish an affidavit of lost certificate, surety bond or other customary
indemnity).

  



  

(f) The Exchange Agent shall invest any cash included in the
Exchange Fund as directed by SONA; _provided_ , that no such investment or
losses thereon shall affect the Merger Consideration or any cash in lieu of
fractional shares payable to holders of EVBS Common Stock or EVBS Series B
Preferred Stock entitled to receive such consideration, and SONA shall
promptly provide additional funds to the Exchange Agent for the benefit of
holders of EVBS Common Stock or EVBS Series B Preferred Stock in the amount of
any such losses to the extent

  



    

 | 7| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

necessary for payment of the Merger Consideration. Any interest or other
income resulting from such investments shall be paid to SONA or as
directed by SONA. Any portion of the Exchange Fund (and any interest or other
income earned thereon) that remains unclaimed by the holders of EVBS Common
Stock and EVBS Series B Preferred Stock for twelve (12) months after the
Effective Date shall, to the extent permitted by law, be paid to the
Continuing Corporation. Any former holders of EVBS Common Stock or EVBS Series
B Preferred Stock who has not theretofore complied with this Article 2 shall
thereafter look only to the Continuing Corporation for payment of the
Merger Consideration and any unpaid dividends and distributions on Continuing
Corporation Common Stock or Continuing Corporation Non-Voting Common Stock
deliverable in respect of each former share of EVBS Common Stock or EVBS
Series B Preferred Stock such shareholder holds as determined pursuant to
this agreement, in each case, without any interest thereon.

  



  

Section 2.4 _Rights of Former Holders of EVBS Common Stock and EVBS Series
B Preferred Stock_.

  



  

At the Effective Date, the stock transfer books of EVBS shall be closed as to
holders of EVBS Common Stock and EVBS Series B Preferred Stock, and no
transfer of EVBS Common Stock or EVBS Series B Preferred Stock by any such
holder shall thereafter be made or recognized. Until surrendered for exchange
in accordance with the provisions of Section 2.3, each Book-Entry Share or
Certificate shall from and after the Effective Date represent for all
purposes only the right to receive the applicable portion of the Merger
Consideration in exchange therefor. To the extent permitted by law, former
holders of record of EVBS Common Stock and EVBS Series B Preferred Stock shall
be entitled to vote after the Effective Date at any meeting of Continuing
Corporation shareholders the number of whole shares of Continuing Corporation
Common Stock into which their respective shares of EVBS Common Stock and EVBS
Series B Preferred Stock are converted, regardless of whether such holders
have surrendered their Book-Entry Shares or Certificates for exchange as
provided in Section 2.3, but beginning thirty (30) days after the Effective
Date, no such holder shall be entitled to vote on any matter until
such holder surrenders such Certificate or Book-Entry Share for exchange as
provided in Article 2. Whenever a dividend or other distribution is declared
by the Continuing Corporation on Continuing Corporation Common Stock or
Continuing Corporation Non-Voting Common Stock, the record date for which is
at or after the Effective Date, the declaration shall include dividends or
other distributions on all shares issuable pursuant to this Agreement, but no
dividend or other distribution payable to the holders of record of
EVBS Common Stock or EVBS Series B Preferred Stock, if any, as of any time
subsequent to the Effective Date shall be delivered to the holder of any
Book-Entry Share or Certificate issued and outstanding at the Effective Date
until such holder surrenders such Book-Entry Share or Certificate for
exchange as provided in Section 2.3. However, upon surrender of such Book-
Entry Share or Certificate representing EVBS Common Stock or EVBS Series B
Preferred Stock, the Merger Consideration, together with all such undelivered
dividends or other distributions without interest, shall be delivered and
paid with respect to each Book-Entry Share or other share represented by such
Certificate.

  



  

Section 2.5 _EVBS Stock Options and Other Equity-Based Awards_.

  



  

(a) At the Effective Date, each option to purchase shares of EVBS
Common Stock (an " _EVBS Stock Option_ ") granted under an equity or equity-
based compensation plan of EVBS

  



    

 | 8| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

(an " _EVBS Stock Plan_ ") that is outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Date shall vest and be converted into and become an option to
purchase shares of Continuing Corporation Common Stock (each, an " _Assumed
Option_ "), and the Continuing Corporation shall assume each Assumed Option,
in accordance with the terms of the EVBS Stock Plan and award agreement by
which it is evidenced, except that (i) each Assumed Option assumed by the
Continuing Corporation may be exercised solely for shares of Continuing
Corporation Common Stock, (ii) the number of shares of Continuing Corporation
Common Stock subject to such Assumed Option shall be equal to the number of
shares of EVBS Common Stock subject to such Assumed Option immediately prior
to the Effective Date multiplied by the Exchange Ratio and rounding down to
the nearest share and (iii) the per share exercise price of such Assumed
Option shall be adjusted by dividing the per share exercise price of such
Assumed Option by the Exchange Ratio and rounding up to the nearest
cent. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the method of adjusting each Assumed
Option that is intended to be an "incentive stock option" (as defined in
Section 422 of the Code) shall comply with the requirements of Section 424 of
the Code and the regulations promulgated thereunder and the method of
adjusting all other Assumed Options shall comply with Section 409A of the Code
and the regulations promulgated thereunder, so as not to constitute a
modification of such Assumed Option that would cause such Assumed Option to
violate Code Section 409A. At the Effective Date, the Continuing Corporation
shall assume the EVBS Stock Plans; _provided_ that such assumption shall only
be with respect to the Assumed Options, and the Continuing Corporation shall
have no obligation to make any additional grants or awards under the EVBS
Stock Plans.

  



  

(b) The Continuing Corporation shall deliver to the holders of
Assumed Options, as soon as practicable after the Effective Date, any
required notices setting forth such holders' rights pursuant to the Assumed
Option and stating that such Assumed Option has been issued by the Continuing
Corporation and shall continue in effect on the same terms and conditions
(subject to the adjustments required by this Section 2.5).

  



  

(c) At the Effective Date, each share of EVBS Common Stock subject
to time-based or performance-based vesting restrictions granted under a EVBS
Stock Plan (a " _EVBS Stock Award_ ") that is outstanding immediately prior to
the Effective Date shall become fully vested and nonforfeitable and shall be
converted automatically into and shall thereafter represent the right to
receive, without interest, the Merger Consideration, less the amount of any
required withholding Tax, and the shares of EVBS Common Stock subject to such
EVBS Stock Award will be treated in the same manner as all other shares of
EVBS Common Stock for such purposes.

  



  

(d) At or prior to the Effective Date, EVBS, the Board of Directors
of EVBS or a committee thereof, as applicable, shall adopt any
resolutions and take any actions which are necessary to effectuate the
provisions of this Section 2.5, including, but not limited to, delivering a
notice of a change of control event under the terms of the EVBS Stock Plans at
least thirty (30) days prior to the Effective Date.

  



  

Section 2.6 _No Fractional Shares_.

  



  

Each holder of shares of EVBS Common Stock or EVBS Series B Preferred Stock
exchanged pursuant to the Merger which would otherwise have been entitled to
receive a fraction

  



    

 | 9| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

of a share of Continuing Corporation Common Stock or Continuing Corporation
Non-Voting Common Stock, as applicable, shall receive, in lieu thereof,
cash (without interest and rounded to the nearest cent) in an amount equal to
such fractional part of a share of Continuing Corporation Common Stock or
Continuing Corporation Non-Voting Common Stock, as applicable, multiplied by
the closing sale price of SONA Common Stock on the NASDAQ Global Market for
the trading day immediately preceding (but not including) the Effective Date.

  



  

Section 2.7 _Withholding Rights_.

  



  

The Exchange Agent will be entitled to deduct and withhold from the Merger
Consideration otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement to any person such
amounts, if any, as it is required to deduct and withhold with respect to the
making of such payment under the Code or any provision of state, local or
foreign Tax (as defined herein) law. To the extent that amounts are so
withheld and remitted to the appropriate Governmental Authority by the
Exchange Agent, such amounts withheld will be treated for all purposes of this
Agreement as having been paid to such person in respect of which such
deduction and withholding was made by the Exchange Agent.

Section 3.1 _Disclosure Letters_.

  



  

(a) Prior to the execution and delivery of this Agreement, each
party has delivered to the other party a letter (its " _Disclosure Letter_ ")
setting forth, among other things, items the disclosure of which is necessary
or appropriate either in response to an express disclosure requirement
contained in a provision hereof or as an exception to one or more of such
party's representations or warranties contained in Section 3.3 or to one or
more of its covenants or agreements contained in Articles 4 or 5; _provided_
, that (i) no such item is required to be set forth in a party's Disclosure
Letter as an exception to any representation or warranty of such party if its
absence would not result in the related representation or warranty being
deemed untrue or incorrect under the standard established by Section 3.2, and
(ii) the mere inclusion of an item in a party's Disclosure Letter as
an exception to a representation or warranty shall not be deemed an admission
by that party that such item represents a material exception or fact, event
or circumstance or that such item is reasonably likely to result in a Material
Adverse Effect (as defined herein) with respect to such party.

  



  

(b) Any disclosures made with respect to a subsection of Section 3.3
shall be deemed to qualify (i) any subsections of Section 3.3
specifically referenced or cross-referenced and (ii) other subsections of
Section 3.3 to the extent it is reasonably apparent (notwithstanding the
absence of a specific cross reference) from a reading of the disclosure that
such disclosure (A) applies to such other subsections and (B) contains
sufficient detail to enable a reasonable person to recognize the relevance of
such disclosure to such other subsections.

Section 3.3(e) only, such failures to be true and correct as are
insignificant) and (ii) Section 3.3(c)(i) and Section 3.3(w), which shall be
true and correct in all material respects) will be deemed untrue or incorrect,
including for purposes of Section 6.2(a) and Section 6.3(a), and no party
will be deemed to have breached a representation or warranty, as
a consequence of the existence or absence of any fact, event or circumstance
unless such fact, event or circumstance, individually or taken together with
all other facts, events or circumstances inconsistent with any representation
or warranty contained in Section 3.3 has had or is reasonably likely to have
a Material Adverse Effect on such party (it being understood that, for
purposes of determining the accuracy of such representations and warranties,
all materiality and "Material Adverse Effect" qualifications and exceptions
contained in such representations and warranties shall be disregarded).

adverse to the business, properties, assets, liabilities, financial condition
or results of operations of such party and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole,
or (ii) materially impairs the ability of such party to perform its
obligations under this Agreement or to consummate the Merger and the other

businesses and the interpretation of such laws and regulations by any
Governmental Authority, (B) changes after the date of this Agreement in
generally accepted accounting principles or regulatory accounting

specifically relating to such party or its Subsidiaries, (D) the effects of
the actions expressly permitted or required by this Agreement or that are
taken with the prior informed consent of the other party in contemplation
of the transactions contemplated hereby, (E) the public disclosure of this
Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby, if such impact is
demonstrably shown to have been proximately caused by such disclosure or (F) a
decline in the trading price of a party's common stock or the failure, in and
of itself, to meet earnings projections or internal financial forecasts,
but not, in either case, including the underlying causes thereof; except,
with respect to clauses (A), (B) or (C) to the extent that the effects of
such change are materially disproportionately adverse to the business,
properties, assets, liabilities, financial condition or results of operations

Subject to and giving effect to Section 3.1 and Section 3.2 and except as set
forth in the relevant Disclosure Letters or in any of such party's SEC
Reports (as defined below) filed on or after January 1, 2016 and prior to the
date hereof (but excluding any risk factor disclosures contained under the
heading "Risk Factors," any disclosure of risks included in any "forward-
looking statements" disclaimer or any other statements that are similarly
non-specific or cautionary, predictive or forward-looking in nature),
SONA represents and warrants to EVBS, to the extent applicable, and EVBS
represents and warrants to SONA, to the extent applicable, as follows:

  



  

(a) _Organization, Standing and Power_. It is a Virginia
corporation duly organized, validly existing and in good standing under the
laws of Virginia. It has the corporate power and authority to carry on its
business as now conducted and to own, lease and operate its assets,
properties and business. It is duly registered as a bank holding company
under the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956, as amended. It is duly licensed
or qualified to do business and is in good standing in each jurisdiction in
which the nature of the business conducted by it or the character or location
of the properties and assets owned or leased by it makes such licensing or
qualification necessary, except where the failure to be so licensed or
qualified is not reasonably likely to have, individually or in the aggregate,
a Material Adverse Effect. Neither it nor any of its Subsidiaries is in
violation of any provision of the Organizational Documents or such articles
or certificate of incorporation and bylaws (or comparable organizational
documents) of such Subsidiary, as applicable. True and complete copies of its
Articles of Incorporation, Bylaws or other similar governing instruments (the
" _Organizational Documents_ "), in each case as amended to the date hereof
and as in full force and effect as of the date hereof have been made
available to the other party.

  



  

(b) _Subsidiaries_. Each of its Subsidiaries (i) is a duly
organized bank, corporation or statutory trust, validly existing and in good
standing under applicable laws of the jurisdiction in which it is
incorporated or organized, (ii) has full corporate power and authority to
carry on its business as now conducted and to own, lease and operate its
assets, properties and business, and (iii) is duly licensed or qualified to
do business in each jurisdiction in which the nature of the business conducted
by it or the character or location of the properties and assets owned or
leased by it makes such licensing or qualification necessary, except where the
failure to be so licensed or qualified is not reasonably likely to have,
either individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect. The
outstanding shares of capital stock or equity interests of each of its
Subsidiaries are validly issued and outstanding, fully paid and nonassessable
and all such shares or equity interests are directly or indirectly owned by it
free and clear of all liens, claims and encumbrances or preemptive rights of
any person. No rights are authorized, issued or outstanding with respect to
the capital stock or equity interests of any of its Subsidiaries and there
are no agreements, understandings or commitments relating to the right to
vote or to dispose of the capital stock or equity interests of any of its
Subsidiaries. There are no restrictions on the ability of any of its
Subsidiaries to pay dividends or distributions except, in the case of a
Subsidiary that is a regulated entity, for restrictions on dividends or
distributions generally applicable to all such regulated entities. The
deposits of each of its Subsidiaries that is a commercial bank are insured by
the Deposit Insurance Fund of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (the
" _FDIC_ ") to the maximum extent permitted by law, all premiums and
assessments required to be paid in

  



    

 | 12| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

connection therewith have been paid when due, and no proceedings for the
termination of such insurance are pending or threatened. A true and
complete list of its direct and indirect Subsidiaries as of the date hereof
is set forth in Section 3.3(b) of its Disclosure Letter that shows each
Subsidiary's jurisdiction of incorporation, each jurisdiction in which each
Subsidiary is qualified and/or licensed to do business, its form of
organization (corporate, partnership, joint venture), and lists the owner(s)
and percentage ownership (direct or indirect) of each Subsidiary.

  



  

The term " _Subsidiary_ " when used with respect to any party means any
corporation or other business organization, whether incorporated or
unincorporated, at least a majority of the securities or other interests of
which that have by their terms ordinary voting power to elect a majority of
the board of directors or others performing similar functions with respect to
such corporation or other organization is directly or indirectly owned or
controlled by such party or by any one or more of its Subsidiaries.

  



  

(c) _Authority; No Breach of the Agreement_.

  



  

(i) It has all necessary corporate power and authority to execute,
deliver and perform its obligations under this Agreement, and, subject to
obtaining the SONA Shareholder Approvals (as defined below) and the EVBS
Shareholder Approval (as defined below) to consummate the transactions
contemplated hereby. The execution, delivery and performance of this
Agreement, and the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby,
including the Merger, by it have been duly and validly authorized by all
necessary corporate action (including valid authorization and unanimous
adoption of this Agreement by its board of directors) and subject only to the

the Plan of Merger by the holders of more than two-thirds of the outstanding
shares of SONA Common Stock present and entitled to vote (collectively, the "
_SONA Shareholder Approvals_ ").

  



  

(ii) This Agreement has been duly executed and delivered by it and
assuming due authorization, execution and delivery of this Agreement by the
other party, this Agreement is a valid and legally binding obligation,
enforceable in accordance with its terms, except as enforceability may be
limited by applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, fraudulent transfer,
reorganization, moratorium and similar laws affecting the enforcement of
rights of creditors or by general principles of equity. SONA represents and
warrants that the Continuing Corporation Common Stock to be issued in the
Merger, when issued, will be validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable.

  



  

(iii) Neither the execution and delivery of this Agreement by it, nor
the consummation by it of the transactions contemplated hereby, nor
compliance by it with any of the provisions hereof will: (A) conflict with,
violate or result in a breach or default of any provision of
its Organizational Documents; (B) constitute or result in the breach of any
term, condition or provision of, or constitute a default under, or give rise
to any right of termination, cancellation or acceleration with respect to, or
result in the creation of any lien, charge or

encumbrance upon, any property or asset of it or any of its Subsidiaries
pursuant to any (1) note, bond, mortgage, indenture, or (2) any material
license, agreement or other instrument or obligation, to which it or any of
its Subsidiaries is a party or by which it or any of its Subsidiaries or any
of their properties or assets may be bound; or (C) subject to the receipt of
all required regulatory and shareholder approvals, violate any order, writ,
injunction, decree, statute, rule or regulation applicable to it or any of its
Subsidiaries.

trust. To its Knowledge, no "fiduciary," as defined in Section 3(21) of
ERISA, of any Benefit Plan has any liability for breach of fiduciary duty
under ERISA.

  



  

(viii) There are no actions, suits, investigations or claims pending, or
to its Knowledge threatened or anticipated, with respect to any of its or its
Subsidiaries' Benefit Plans (other than routine claims for benefits). None of
its or its Subsidiaries' Benefit Plans is the subject of a pending or, to its
Knowledge, threatened investigation or audit by the Internal Revenue Service,
the U.S. Department of Labor, the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation, or
any other federal or state governmental department or entity.

  



  

(ix) Except as set forth in Section 3.3(o)(ix) of its Disclosure
Letter, neither the execution and delivery of this Agreement nor the
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby will (either alone or in
conjunction with any other event) (A) result in, cause the
vesting, exercisability or delivery of, or increase in the amount or value
of, any payment, right or other benefit to any current or former employee,
leased employee, independent contractor, officer, director or other service
provider of it or any of its Subsidiaries, or (B) result in any (1)
requirement to fund any benefits or set aside benefits in a trust (including a
rabbi trust) or (2) limitation on the right of it or any of its Subsidiaries
to amend, merge, terminate or receive a reversion of assets from any Benefit
Plan or related trust. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing and
except as otherwise set forth in Section 3.3(o)(ix) of its Disclosure Letter,
no amount paid or payable (whether in cash, in property, or in the form of
benefits) by it or any of its Subsidiaries in connection with the
transactions contemplated hereby (either solely as a result thereof or as a
result of such transactions in conjunction with any other event) will be an
"excess parachute payment" within the meaning of Section 280G of the Code.
Except as set forth in Section 3.3(o)(ix) of its Disclosure Letter, no Benefit
Plan maintained by it or any of its Subsidiaries provides for the gross-up or
reimbursement of Taxes under Section 4999 or 409A of the Code, or otherwise.

  



  

(x) Except as set forth in Section 3.3(o)(x) of its Disclosure
Letter, it and its Subsidiaries have made prior to the date hereof all

committed to make to any employee or independent contractor under any Benefit
Plan for calendar years 2013, 2014 and 2015.

(xi) Each Benefit Plan of it and its Subsidiaries that is a health or
welfare plan has terms that are in compliance with and has been
administered in accordance with the requirements of the ACA. It and its
Subsidiaries have complied in all respects with the requirements of Section
4980H of the Code so as to avoid the imposition of any taxes or assessable
payments thereunder. Neither it nor any of its Subsidiaries has any liability
or obligation to provide postretirement health, medical or life insurance
benefits to any employees or former employees, leased employees, independent
contractors, officers, or directors, or any dependent or beneficiary
thereof, except as otherwise required under state or federal benefits
continuation laws. In the case of any such required continuation
coverage, the covered individual is required to pay the full cost of
coverage. No tax under Code Sections 4980B, 4980H or 5000 has been
incurred with respect to any Benefit Plan of it or its Subsidiaries, it, or
any of its Subsidiaries, and no circumstance exists which could give rise to
such tax.

  



  

(p) _Insurance_. Except as would not reasonably be expected to
have, either individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect, it
and its Subsidiaries are insured with reputable insurers against such risks
and in such amounts as its management reasonably has determined to be prudent
in accordance with industry practices, and are in compliance in all material
respects with their insurance policies and are not in default under any of
the terms thereof. Each such insurance policy is outstanding and in full force
and effect, and, except for policies insuring against potential liabilities
of officers, directors and employees of it and its Subsidiaries, it or its
relevant Subsidiary is the sole named beneficiary of such policies, and all
premiums and other payments due under any such policy have been paid, and all
claims thereunder have been filed in due and timely fashion. Since December
31, 2015, neither it nor any of its Subsidiaries has received any notice of a
premium increase or cancellation or a failure to renew with respect to any
insurance policy or bond or, within the last three (3) calendar years and
since January 1, 2016 has been refused any insurance coverage sought or
applied for, and it has no reason to believe that existing insurance coverage
cannot be renewed as and when the same shall expire upon terms and conditions
as favorable as those presently in effect, other than possible increases in
premiums or unavailability of coverage that do not result from any
extraordinary loss experience on the part of it or its Subsidiaries. Set
forth in Section 3.3(p) of its Disclosure Letter is a list of all insurance
policies or bonds currently maintained by it and its Subsidiaries.

applicability relating to or affecting creditors' rights and to general
equity principles, and no defense, offset or counterclaim has been asserted

Adverse Effect.

with the other terms of this Section 5.5, from furnishing
nonpublic information to, or entering into discussions or negotiations with,
any person or entity that makes an unsolicited, bona fide written Acquisition
Proposal with respect to such party (that did not result from a breach of this
Section 5.5) if, and only to the extent that (i) such party's board of
directors concludes in good faith, after consultation with outside legal
counsel, that the failure to take such actions would be reasonably likely to
result in a violation of its fiduciary duties to its shareholders
under applicable law, (ii) before taking such action, such party receives
from such person or entity an executed confidentiality agreement on terms no
less restrictive with respect to the confidential treatment of information by
such party than the Confidentiality Agreement, which confidentiality
agreement shall not provide such person or entity with any exclusive right to
negotiate with such party, provided, that any non-public information provided
to any person given such access shall have previously been provided to the
other party or shall be provided to the other party prior to or concurrently
with the time it is provided to such person, and (iii) such party's board of
directors concludes in good faith, after consultation with its outside legal
counsel and financial advisors, that the Acquisition Proposal constitutes or
is reasonably likely to result in a Superior Proposal (as defined below). Each
party shall immediately (within twenty-four (24) hours) notify the other
party orally and in writing of its receipt of any such Acquisition Proposal,
the material terms and conditions thereof, the identity of the person making
such Acquisition Proposal, and will keep the other party apprised of any
related developments, discussions and negotiations on a current basis,
including by providing a copy of all material documentation or correspondence
relating thereto.

  



  

(c) For purposes of this Agreement, an " _Acquisition Proposal_ "
means, other than the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, any offer,
proposal or inquiry relating to, or any third party indication of interest in,
any of the following transactions involving SONA or EVBS, or their respective
Subsidiaries: (i) a merger, consolidation, share exchange, business
combination, reorganization, recapitalization, liquidation, dissolution or
other similar transaction

  



    

 | 36| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

involving a party or its Subsidiaries whose assets, individually or in the
aggregate, constitute more than 20% of the consolidated assets of the
party; (ii) any acquisition or purchase, direct or indirect, of 20% or more
of the consolidated assets of a party and its Subsidiaries or 20% or more of
any class of equity or voting securities of a party or its Subsidiaries whose
assets, individually or in the aggregate, constitute more than 20% of the
consolidated assets of the party; or (iii) any tender offer (including a self-
tender offer) or exchange offer that, if consummated, would result in such
third party beneficially owning 20% or more of any class of equity or voting
securities of a party or its Subsidiaries whose assets, individually or in the
aggregate, constitute more than 20% of the consolidated assets of the party.

  



  

(d) For purposes of this Agreement, a " _Superior Proposal_ " means
an unsolicited, bona fide written Acquisition Proposal made by a person or
entity (or group of persons or entities acting in concert within the meaning
of Rule 13d-5 under the Exchange Act) that the Board of Directors of SONA or
EVBS, as the case may be, concludes in good faith, after consultation with its
financial and outside legal advisors, taking into account all legal,
financial, regulatory and other aspects of the Acquisition Proposal and
including the terms and conditions of this Agreement (as it may be proposed to
be amended by SONA or EVBS, as applicable) (i) is more favorable to the
shareholders of SONA or EVBS, as the case may be, from a financial point of
view, than the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (as it may be
proposed to be amended by SONA or EVBS, as applicable), (ii) is fully financed
or reasonably capable of being fully financed, and (iii) if accepted, is
reasonably likely to receive all required approvals of
Governmental Authorities on a timely basis and otherwise reasonably capable
of being completed on the terms proposed; provided that, for purposes of this
definition of "Superior Proposal," the Acquisition Proposal shall have the
meaning assigned to such term in Section 5.5(c), except the reference to "20%
or more" in such definition shall be deemed to be a reference to "50%" and
"Acquisition Proposal" shall only be deemed to refer to a transaction
involving EVBS or SONA or one of their respective banking Subsidiaries.

  



  

(e) Except as provided in Section 5.5(f), neither the Board of
Directors of EVBS, the Board of Directors of SONA, nor, in each case, any
committee thereof shall withhold, withdraw or modify in any manner adverse to
the other party, or propose publicly to withhold, withdraw or modify in any
manner adverse to the other party, the approval, recommendation or declaration
of advisability by the Board of Directors of EVBS or SONA, as applicable, or
any such committee thereof with respect to this Agreement or the transactions
contemplated hereby (a " _Change in EVBS Recommendation_ " or a " _Change in
SONA Recommendation_ ," respectively).

  



  

(f) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary,
with respect to an Acquisition Proposal, the Board of Directors of EVBS or
SONA, as applicable, may either:

  



  

(i) enter into a definitive agreement to accept a Superior Proposal
and terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 7.1(j) or Section 7.1(k), as
the case may be, provided that such party shall pay the Termination Fee
required to be paid pursuant to Section 7.4(b) or Section 7.4(d), as the case
may be; or

  



  

(ii) make a Change in EVBS Recommendation or a Change in SONA
Recommendation, as applicable, if and only if (A) an unsolicited bona
fide written Acquisition Proposal (that did not result from a breach of this
Section 5.5) is made to EVBS or SONA, as

  



    

 | 37| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

applicable, by a third party, and such Acquisition Proposal is not withdrawn,
(B) the Board of Directors of EVBS or SONA, as applicable, has concluded in
good faith (after consultation with its outside legal counsel and financial
advisors) that such Acquisition Proposal constitutes a Superior Proposal, (C)
the Board of Directors of EVBS or SONA, as applicable, have concluded in good
faith (after consultation with their outside legal counsel) that failure to
make a Change in EVBS Recommendation or a Change in SONA Recommendation, as
applicable, would be reasonably likely to result in a violation of its
fiduciary duties to its shareholders under applicable law, (D) five (5)
business days shall have elapsed since the party proposing to take such action
has given written notice to the other party advising such other party that
the notifying party intends to take such action and specifying in reasonable
detail the reasons therefor, including the terms and conditions of any such
Acquisition Proposal that is the basis of the proposed action (a " _Notice of
Recommendation Change_ ") (it being understood that any amendment to any
material term of such Acquisition Proposal shall require a new Notice of
Recommendation Change, except that, in such case, the five (5) business day
period referred to in this clause (D) and in clauses (E) and (F) shall be
reduced to three (3) business days following the giving of such new Notice of
Recommendation Change), (E) during such five (5) business day period, the
notifying party has considered and, at the reasonable request of the other
party, engaged in good faith discussions with such party regarding, any
adjustment or modification of the terms of this Agreement proposed by the
other party, and (F) the board of directors of the party proposing to take
such action, following such five (5) business day period, again reasonably
determines in good faith (after consultation with its outside legal counsel
and its financial advisors, and taking into account any adjustment or
modification of the terms of this Agreement proposed by the other party) that
such Acquisition Proposal nonetheless continues to constitute a Superior
Proposal and that failure to take such action is reasonably likely to result
in a violation of its fiduciary duties to its shareholders under applicable
law.

(a) The parties hereto shall cooperate and use their reasonable best

as to the form and substance of any press release or other public

likely to become the subject of public disclosure); provided, that nothing in

Section 5.9 _Employee Benefit Plans_.

  



  

(a) On or as soon as reasonably practicable following the Effective
Date, the Continuing Corporation shall provide to officers and employees of
EVBS and its Subsidiaries, who at or after the Effective Date become employees
of the Continuing Corporation or its Subsidiaries (" _EVBS Continuing
Employees_ "), employee benefits under Benefit Plans maintained by the
Continuing Corporation, on terms and conditions which are determined by the
Continuing Corporation, in good faith, to be, in the aggregate,
substantially comparable to the benefits provided to the EVBS Continuing
Employees under the EVBS Benefit Plans as in effect immediately prior to the
Effective Date. Until such time as the EVBS Continuing Employees are able to
participate in the Benefit Plans of the Continuing Corporation, the
Continuing Corporation shall maintain for the benefit of the EVBS Continuing
Employees the Benefit Plans maintained by EVBS immediately prior to the
Effective Date (it being understood that participation in the Continuing
Corporation's Benefit Plans may commence at different times with respect to
each Benefit Plan); _provided_ , _however_ , that this provision shall not
apply to any Benefit Plan of EVBS or its Subsidiaries that was terminated or
in which participation was frozen on or prior to the Effective Date.

  



  

(b) For purposes of participation, vesting and, for vacation or
similar paid time off accrual only, benefit accrual under the

any of its Subsidiaries shall be treated as service with the Continuing

  



    

 | 39| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

Corporation. To the extent permitted under applicable law, the Continuing
Corporation shall cause welfare Benefit Plans maintained by the Continuing
Corporation that cover the EVBS Continuing Employees after the Effective Date
to (i) waive any waiting period and restrictions and limitations for
preexisting conditions or insurability (except for pre-existing conditions
that were excluded, or restrictions or limitations that were applicable,
under the Benefit Plans maintained by EVBS), and (ii) cause any deductible,
co-insurance, or maximum out-of-pocket payments made by the EVBS Continuing
Employees under welfare Benefit Plans maintained by EVBS to be credited to
such EVBS Continuing Employees under welfare Benefit Plans maintained by the
Continuing Corporation, so as to reduce the amount of any deductible, co-
insurance, or maximum out-of-pocket payments payable by such EVBS Continuing
Employees under welfare Benefit Plans maintained by the
Continuing Corporation.

  



  

(c) Prior to the Effective Date, EVBS shall one hundred percent vest
all accrued benefits provided under the VBA Defined Contribution Plan for
Eastern Virginia Bankshares, Inc. (the " _EVBS 401(k) Plan_ "), subject to
consummation of the Merger. SONA and EVBS shall use reasonable efforts to
take such action as may be necessary to merge the EVBS 401(k) Plan and the VBA
Defined Contribution Plan for Sonabank (the " _SONA 401(k) Plan_ " and
together with the EVBS 401(k) Plan, each a " _401(k) Plan_ "), with the
specifics and timing of such merger to be determined by the parties in good
faith. In the event the parties determine that the merger of the 401(k) Plans
is to occur after the Effective Date, then prior to the Effective Date,
each party agrees to amend its 401(k) Plan to insure that there is no
duplication of participation or benefits in the 401(k) Plans.

  



  

(d) With regard to the VBA Cash Balance Pension Plan for Eastern
Virginia Bankshares, Inc. (the " _EVBS Cash Balance Plan_ "), unless agreed
upon otherwise in writing by the parties hereto, prior to the Effective Date,
EVBS will fully fund the EVBS Cash Balance Plan as calculated by the EVBS
Cash Balance Plan's actuary on a plan termination basis to ensure that there
is no funding deficiency as of the Effective Date. In addition, prior to the
Effective Date, EVBS shall amend the EVBS Cash Balance Plan and take such
other actions as necessary, effective as of the Effective Date or such earlier
time agreed upon by the parties, to terminate the EVBS Cash Balance Plan in
accordance with its terms and applicable law and provide for 100% vesting to
all affected participants in the EVBS Cash Balance Plan. The parties agree
that the EVBS Cash Balance Plan will be submitted to the IRS for a
determination letter following its termination and distributions from the EVBS
Cash Balance Plan shall be made in accordance with plan terms and applicable
law after receipt of a favorable determination letter.

  



  

(e) Prior to the Effective Date, EVBS and SONA will determine if any
Benefit Plans of EVBS or SONA not otherwise addressed in this Agreement are
to be terminated prior to the Effective Date. If the parties hereto agree that
any such Benefit Plans are to be terminated, EVBS or SONA, as appropriate,
shall take all steps necessary to terminate any such Benefit Plans immediately
preceding the Effective Date and pay any benefits due thereunder in
accordance with the terms of any such plan and/or in accordance with Section
409A of the Code, if applicable.

  



  

(f) Nothing in this Section 5.9 shall be construed to limit the
right of the Continuing Corporation or any of its Subsidiaries, from and
after the Effective Date, to amend or terminate any of the Benefit Plans
maintained by SONA or EVBS or their respective Subsidiaries before

the Effective Date to the extent such amendment or termination is permitted
by the terms of the applicable Benefit Plan.

  



  

Section 5.10 _Reservation of Shares; NASDAQ Listing_.

  



  

(a) SONA shall take all corporate action as may be necessary to
authorize and reserve for issuance such number of shares of Continuing
Corporation Common Stock to be issued pursuant to this Agreement, and to
cause all such shares, when issued pursuant to this Agreement, to be duly
authorized, validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable.

  



  

(b)  SONA shall use all reasonable best efforts to cause the shares
of the Continuing Corporation Common Stock to be issued in the Merger to be
approved for listing on the NASDAQ Global Market, subject to official notice
of issuance, as promptly as practicable, and in any event before the
Effective Date.

  



  

Section 5.11 _Indemnification_.

  



  

(a) Following the Effective Date, the Continuing Corporation and its
Subsidiaries, as the case may be, shall indemnify, defend and hold
harmless any person who has rights to indemnification from EVBS or any of its
Subsidiaries (an " _Indemnified Party_ ") (in all capacities), to the same
extent and on the same conditions as such person was entitled to
indemnification pursuant to applicable law and EVBS's Organizational
Documents or any EVBS Subsidiary's Organizational Documents, as the case may
be, as in effect on the date of this Agreement (including advancing expenses
when requested, subject to such person's compliance with Section 13.1-699 of
the VSCA). Without limiting the foregoing, in any case or proceeding in which
corporate approval may be required to effectuate any indemnification, the
Continuing Corporation or its applicable Subsidiary shall direct, if any
Indemnified Party elects, that the determination of permissibility of
indemnification shall be made by independent counsel mutually agreed upon
between the Continuing Corporation or such Subsidiary and such Indemnified
Party.

  



  

(b) The Continuing Corporation shall, at or prior to the Effective
Date, purchase a six (6) year "tail" prepaid policy on the same terms and
conditions as the existing directors' and officers' liability (and fiduciary)
insurance maintained by EVBS from insurance carriers with comparable credit
ratings, covering, without limitation, the Merger; provided, however,
that the cost of such "tail" policy shall in no event exceed three hundred
percent (300%) of the amount of the last annual premium paid by EVBS for such
existing directors' and officers' liability (and fiduciary) insurance. If, but

PLAN OF MERGER

  

BETWEEN

  

SOUTHERN NATIONAL BANCORP OF VIRGINIA, INC.

  

AND

  

EASTERN VIRGINIA BANKSHARES, INC.

  



  

Pursuant to this Plan of Merger (the " _Plan of Merger_ "), Eastern Virginia
Bankshares, Inc., a Virginia corporation (" _EVBS_ "), shall merge with and
into Southern National Bancorp of Virginia, Inc., a Virginia corporation ("
_SONA_ ").

  



  

ARTICLE 1

  

Terms of the Merger

  



   | 1.1| The Merger. 
---|---|--- 
  



  

Subject to the terms and conditions of the Agreement and Plan of Merger,
dated as of December 13, 2016, by and between SONA and EVBS (the " _Agreement_
"), at the Effective Date (as defined herein), EVBS will be merged with and
into SONA (the " _Merger_ "), in accordance with the provisions of Virginia
law, and with the effect specified in Section 13.1-721 of the Virginia Stock
Corporation Act (the " _VSCA_ "). The separate corporate existence of EVBS
thereupon shall cease, and SONA will be the surviving corporation in the
Merger (SONA as existing on and after the Effective Date is sometimes referred
to herein as the " _Continuing Corporation_ " whenever reference is made to
it as of the Effective Date or thereafter). The Merger shall become effective
on such date and time as may be determined in accordance with Section 1.3 of
the Agreement (the " _Effective Date_ "). Without limiting the generality of
the foregoing, from and after the Effective Date, the Continuing Corporation
shall possess all rights, privileges, properties, immunities, powers and
franchises of EVBS, and all of the debts, liabilities, obligations, claims,
restrictions and duties of EVBS shall become the debts, liabilities,
obligations, claims, restrictions and duties of the Continuing Corporation.

  



  

ARTICLE 2

  

Merger Consideration; Exchange Procedures

  



   | 2.1| Conversion of Shares. 
---|---|--- 
  



  

At the Effective Date, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the
part of SONA or EVBS or the holder of any of the following securities:

  



  

(a) Each share of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of SONA
(" _SONA Common Stock_ ") issued and outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Date shall remain an issued and outstanding share of common stock of
the Continuing Corporation and shall not be affected by the Merger.

  



  

   

 | | 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

(b) All shares of common stock, par value $2.00 per share, of EVBS
(" _EVBS Common Stock_ ") issued and outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Date that are owned, directly or indirectly, by SONA or EVBS (other
than shares of EVBS Common Stock held in trust accounts (including grantor or
rabbi trust accounts), managed accounts and similar accounts, or otherwise
held in a fiduciary or agency capacity, that are beneficially owned by third
parties) (any such shares, the " _EVBS Cancelled Shares_ ") shall no longer
be outstanding, shall automatically be cancelled and shall cease to exist and
no consideration shall be delivered in exchange therefor.

  



  

(c) Subject to Section 2.2 of this Plan of Merger, each share of
EVBS Common Stock, except for EVBS Cancelled Shares, issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Date will cease to be outstanding and will
be converted into and exchanged for the right to receive 0.6313 shares (the "
_Exchange Ratio_ ") of validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable shares of
common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of the Continuing Corporation ("
_Continuing Corporation Common Stock_ ") (together, with any cash in lieu of
fractional shares of Continuing Corporation Common Stock to be paid pursuant
to Section 2.5 of this Plan of Merger, the " _Common Stock Merger
Consideration_ ").

  



  

(d) Subject to Section 2.2 of this Plan of Merger, each share of
EVBS Non-Voting Mandatorily Convertible Non-Cumulative Preferred Stock, Series
B, par value $2.00 per share (" _EVBS Series B Preferred Stock_ "), issued
and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Date will cease to be
outstanding and will be converted automatically into and exchanged for the
right to receive, at the election of the holder of such share of EVBS Series
B Preferred Stock, either: (i) 0.6313 shares (equal to the Exchange Ratio) of
validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable shares of Continuing Corporation
Common Stock; or (ii) 0.6313 shares (equal to the Exchange Ratio) of validly
issued, fully paid and nonassessable shares of non-voting common stock of the
Continuing Corporation, par value $0.01 per share (" _Continuing Corporation
Non-Voting Common Stock_ "). The shares of Continuing Corporation
Common Stock and Continuing Corporation Non-Voting Common Stock payable
pursuant to this Section 2.1(d) shall be referred to as the "
_Preferred Stock Merger Consideration_ ", and together with the Common Stock
Merger Consideration, the " _Merger Consideration_ ").

  



  

(e) If, between the date hereof and the Effective Date, the
outstanding shares of SONA Common Stock or EVBS Common Stock shall have been
increased, decreased, changed into or exchanged for a different number or
kind of shares or securities as a result of a reorganization, stock dividend,
stock split, reverse stock split or similar change in capitalization,
appropriate and proportionate adjustments shall be made to the Exchange
Ratio.

  



  

2.2 Exchange Procedures.

  



  

(a) _Appointment of Exchange Agent_. Prior to the Effective Date,
SONA shall appoint an exchange and paying agent reasonably acceptable to
EVBS (the " _Exchange Agent_ ") for the payment and exchange of the Merger
Consideration.

  



  

(b) _SONA to Make Merger Consideration Available_. At or promptly
after the Effective Date, SONA shall for the benefit of holders of shares
of EVBS Common Stock and EVBS Series B Preferred Stock and for exchange in
accordance with this Article 2, (i) deposit, or cause to be deposited, with
the Exchange Agent an amount of cash sufficient to pay the aggregate amount of

  



  

   

 | 2| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

cash payable pursuant to this Article 2 in lieu of fractional shares of
Continuing Corporation Common Stock and Continuing Corporation Non-Voting
Common Stock, (ii) duly authorize and direct issuance by the Exchange Agent
of non-certificated shares represented by book-entry registry of Continuing
Corporation Common Stock payable pursuant to this Article 2 and (iii) duly
authorize and direct issuance by the Exchange Agent of certificated shares of
Continuing Corporation Non-Voting Common Stock payable pursuant to this
Article 2.

  



  

(c) _Distributions to Holders of EVBS Common Stock and EVBS Series
B Preferred Stock_. Upon the Effective Date, each holder of an outstanding
share of EVBS Common Stock and EVBS Series B Preferred Stock who has properly
surrendered such Certificates (as defined herein) or non-certificated shares
represented by book-entry registry of EVBS Common Stock (the " _Book-Entry
Shares_ ") to the Exchange Agent (or affidavits of loss in lieu of such
certificates), (i) (x) the holder of such Certificate or Book-Entry Share
representing EVBS Common Stock will be entitled to evidence of issuance in
book-entry form the number of whole shares of Continuing Corporation
Common Stock (except if such holder has made an election to receive a
physical stock certificate pursuant to Section 2.2(e) of this Plan of Merger)
and (y) the holder of such Certificate representing EVBS Series B Preferred
Stock will be entitled to receive a physical stock certificate for the number
of whole shares of Continuing Corporation Common Stock and/or Continuing
Corporation Non-Voting Common Stock elected by such holder pursuant to
Section 2.1(d) of this Plan of Merger and (ii) the amount of cash, if any,
into which the aggregate number of shares of EVBS Common Stock or EVBS Series
B Preferred Stock, as applicable, previously represented by such Certificates
or Book-Entry Shares surrendered shall have been converted pursuant to this
Plan of Merger. The Exchange Agent shall not be obligated to deliver the
consideration to which any former holder of EVBS Common Stock or EVBS Series B
Preferred Stock is entitled as a result of the Merger until such holder
surrenders his, her or its Certificates or Book-Entry Shares for exchange as
provided in this Section 2.2. Any other provision of this Plan of Merger
notwithstanding, neither the Continuing Corporation nor the Exchange Agent
shall be liable to a holder of the EVBS Common Stock or EVBS Series B
Preferred Stock for any amounts paid or property delivered in good faith to a
public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property law.

  



  

(d) _Election Procedures for EVBS Series B Preferred Stock._ Each
holder of EVBS Series B Preferred Stock has previously provided to SONA a
written agreement (the " _Series B Voting Agreement and Election_ "), which
sets forth such holders election to receive either the Continuing Corporation
Common Stock or the Continuing Corporation Non-Voting Common Stock, or a
combination thereof, as provided in Section 2.1(d) of this Plan of Merger.
Prior to the Effective Date, SONA shall provide the completed Series B Voting
Agreement and Elections to the Exchange Agent. A holder of EVBS Series B
Preferred Stock may revoke or change its election in accordance with the
terms set forth in the Series B Voting Agreement and Election no later than
five (5) days prior to the anticipated Effective Date or on such other date
as SONA and EVBS shall mutually agree (the " _Election Deadline_ "). In the
event an election is revoked prior to the Election Deadline, the shares of
EVBS Series B Preferred Stock represented by such Election Form shall become
"No Election Shares," and the holders of such No Election Shares shall be
deemed to have made an election to receive the Continuing Corporation Common
Stock, except to the extent a subsequent election is properly made with
respect to any or all of such shares of EVBS Series B Preferred Stock prior
to the Election Deadline. Subject to the terms of this Agreement and of the
Series B Voting Agreement and Election, SONA shall have reasonable

  



  

   

 | 3| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

discretion to determine whether any election, revocation or change has been
properly or timely made and to disregard immaterial defects in the Series B
Voting Agreement and Election, and any good faith decisions of SONA regarding
such matters shall be binding and conclusive. None of SONA, EVBS or the
Exchange Agent shall be under any obligation to notify any person of any
defect in a Series B Voting Agreement and Election.

  



  

(e) _Letter of Transmittal_. SONA shall take all steps necessary to
cause the Exchange Agent, within five (5) business days after the Effective
Date, to mail to each holder of (i) an outstanding Certificate or outstanding
Certificates that immediately prior to the Effective Date
represented outstanding shares of EVBS Common Stock of EVBS Series B
Preferred Stock (the " _Certificates_ ") or (ii) Book-Entry Shares, which in
each case, were converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration
with respect thereto, a form letter of transmittal for return to the Exchange
Agent and instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the Certificates
and Book-Entry Shares for the Merger Consideration into which the shares of
such EVBS Common Stock and EVBS Series B Preferred Stock have been converted
pursuant to this Plan of Merger. Such letter of transmittal shall permit each
holder of Certificates or Book-Entry Shares to elect to receive, in lieu of
shares of Continuing Corporation Common Stock or Continuing Corporation Non-
Voting Common Stock, as applicable, represented by book-entry registry, a
physical stock certificate representing shares of Continuing Corporation
Common Stock or Continuing Corporation Non-Voting Common Stock, as
applicable, payable pursuant to this Article 2.

  



  

(f) _Lost Certificates_. A holder of EVBS Common Stock or EVBS
Series B Preferred Stock whose Certificates have been lost, destroyed, stolen
or are otherwise missing shall be entitled to receive its portion of the
Merger Consideration and dividends or distributions to which such
shareholder shall be entitled, if any, upon compliance with reasonable
conditions imposed by the Continuing Corporation and the Exchange
Agent pursuant to applicable law and as required in accordance with the
Continuing Corporation's and the Exchange Agent's standard policy (including
the requirement that the shareholder furnish an affidavit of lost certificate,
surety bond or other customary indemnity).

  



   | 2.3| Rights of Former Holders of EVBS Common Stock and EVBS Series B
Preferred Stock.  
---|---|--- 
  



  

(a) At the Effective Date, the stock transfer books of EVBS shall be
closed as to holders of EVBS Common Stock and EVBS Series B Preferred Stock,
and no transfer of EVBS Common Stock or EVBS Series B Preferred Stock by any
such holder shall thereafter be made or recognized. Until surrendered for
exchange in accordance with the provisions of Section 2.2 of this Plan of
Merger, each Book-Entry Share or Certificate shall from and after the
Effective Date represent for all purposes only the right to receive the
applicable portion of the Merger Consideration in exchange therefor. To the
extent permitted by law, former holders of record of EVBS Common Stock and
EVBS Series B Preferred Stock shall be entitled to vote after the Effective
Date at any meeting of Continuing Corporation shareholders the number of
whole shares of Continuing Corporation Common Stock into which their
respective shares of EVBS Common Stock and EVBS Preferred Stock are
converted, regardless of whether such holders have surrendered their Book-
Entry Shares or Certificates for exchange as provided in Section 2.2 of this
Plan of Merger, but beginning thirty (30) days after the Effective Date, no
such holder shall be entitled to vote on any matter until such holder
surrenders such Certificate or Book-Entry Share for exchange as

  



  

   

 | 4| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

provided in this Article 2. Whenever a dividend or other distribution is
declared by the Continuing Corporation on the Continuing Corporation Common
Stock or the Continuing Corporation Non-Voting Common Stock, the record date
for which is at or after the Effective Date, the declaration shall include
dividends or other distributions on all shares issuable pursuant to this Plan
of Merger, but no dividend or other distribution payable to the holders of
record of EVBS Common Stock or EVBS Series B Preferred Stock, if any, as of
any time subsequent to the Effective Date shall be delivered to the holder of
any Book-Entry Share or Certificate issued and outstanding at the Effective
Date until such holder surrenders such Book-Entry Share or Certificate for
exchange as provided in Section 2.2 of this Plan of Merger. However, upon
surrender of such Book-Entry Share or Certificate representing EVBS Common
Stock or EVBS Series B Preferred Stock, the Merger Consideration, together
with all such undelivered dividends or other distributions without interest,
shall be delivered and paid with respect to each Book-Entry Share or other
share represented by such Certificate.

  



   | 2.4| EVBS Stock Options and Other Equity-Based Awards.  
---|---|--- 
  



  

(a) At the Effective Date, each option to purchase shares of EVBS
Common Stock (an " _EVBS Stock Option_ ") granted under an equity or equity-
based compensation plan of EVBS (an " _EVBS Stock Plan_ ") that is outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Date shall vest and be converted into and
become an option to purchase shares of Continuing Corporation Common Stock
(each, an " _Assumed Option_ "), and the Continuing Corporation shall assume
each Assumed Option, in accordance with the terms of the EVBS Stock Plan and
award agreement by which it is evidenced, except that (i) each Assumed Option
assumed by the Continuing Corporation may be exercised solely for shares of
Continuing Corporation Common Stock, (ii) the number of shares of
Continuing Corporation Common Stock subject to such Assumed Option shall be
equal to the number of shares of EVBS Common Stock subject to such Assumed
Option immediately prior to the Effective Date multiplied by the Exchange
Ratio and rounding down to the nearest share and (iii) the per share exercise
price of such Assumed Option shall be adjusted by dividing the per share
exercise price of such Assumed Option by the Exchange Ratio and rounding up
to the nearest cent. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the method of
adjusting each Assumed Option that is intended to be an "incentive stock
option" (as defined in Section 422 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as
amended (the " _Code_ ")) shall comply with the requirements of Section 424 of
the Code and the regulations promulgated thereunder and the method of
adjusting all other Assumed Options shall comply with Section 409A of
the Code and the regulations promulgated thereunder, so as not to constitute
a modification of such Assumed Option that would cause such Assumed Option to
violate Code Section 409A. At the Effective Date, the Continuing Corporation
shall assume the EVBS Stock Plans; _provided_ that such assumption shall only
be with respect to the Assumed Options, and the Continuing Corporation
shall have no obligation to make any additional grants or awards under the
EVBS Stock Plans.

  



  

(b) The Continuing Corporation shall deliver to the holders of
Assumed Options, as soon as practicable after the Effective Date, any required
notices setting forth such holders' rights pursuant to the Assumed Option and
stating that such Assumed Option has been issued by the
Continuing Corporation and shall continue in effect on the same terms and
conditions (subject to the adjustments required by this Section 2.4).

  



  

   

 | 5| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

(c) At the Effective Date, each share of EVBS Common Stock subject
to time-based or performance-based vesting restrictions granted under a EVBS
Stock Plan (a " _EVBS Stock Award_ ") that is outstanding immediately prior
to the Effective Date shall become fully vested and nonforfeitable and shall
be converted automatically into and shall thereafter represent the right to
receive, without interest, the Merger Consideration, less the amount of any
required withholding Tax (as defined in the Agreement), and the shares of
EVBS Common Stock subject to such EVBS Stock Award will be treated in the
same manner as all other shares of EVBS Common Stock for such purposes.

  



   | 2.5| No Fractional Shares.  
---|---|--- 
  



  

Each holder of shares of EVBS Common Stock or EVBS Series B Preferred Stock
exchanged pursuant to the Merger which would otherwise have been entitled
to receive a fraction of a share of Continuing Corporation Common Stock or
Continuing Corporation Non-Voting Common Stock, as applicable, shall receive,
in lieu thereof, cash (without interest and rounded to the nearest cent) in an
amount equal to such fractional part of a share of Continuing Corporation
Common Stock or Continuing Corporation Non-Voting Common Stock, as applicable,
multiplied by the closing sale price of SONA Common Stock on the NASDAQ
Global Market for the trading day immediately preceding (but not
including) the Effective Date.

  



   | 2.6| Withholding Rights.  
---|---|--- 
  



  

The Exchange Agent will be entitled to deduct and withhold from the Merger
Consideration otherwise payable pursuant to this Plan of Merger to any
person such amounts, if any, as it is required to deduct and withhold with
respect to the making of such payment under the Internal Revenue Code of
1986, as amended, or any provision of state, local or foreign Tax (as defined
in the Agreement) law. To the extent that amounts are so withheld and
remitted to the appropriate Governmental Authority (as defined in the
Agreement) by the Exchange Agent, such amounts withheld will be treated for
all purposes of this Plan of Merger as having been paid to such person in
respect of which such deduction and withholding was made by the Exchange
Agent.

Article 3. Registered Office and Registered Agent. The address of the
registered office of the Corporation in the Commonwealth of Virginia is

County. The name of the registered agent at such address is William H. Lagos,
who is a resident of the Commonwealth of Virginia.

  



  

Article 4. Purpose of Corporation. The purpose of the Corporation is to
engage in any lawful act or activity for which a corporation may be
organized under the Stock Corporation Act of the Commonwealth of Virginia.

  



  

Article 5. Capital Stock.

  



  

A. Total Capital Stock. The total number of shares of capital stock which the
Corporation has authority to issue is 50,000,000, of which 5,000,000 shall be
preferred stock, $.01 par value per share (hereinafter the "Preferred Stock"),
and 45,000,000 shall be common stock, par value $.01 per share. The Common
Stock shall consist of two separate classes, of which 41,000,000 shares shall
be designated as Voting Common Stock (the "Voting Common Stock") and
4,000,000 shares shall be designated as Non-Voting Common Stock (the "Non-
Voting Common Stock," and together with the Voting Common Stock, the "Common
Stock").

  



  

B. The Common Stock.

  



  

(a) Each holder of Voting Common Stock, as such, shall be entitled
to one vote for each share of Voting Common Stock held of record by such
holder on all matters on which shareholders generally are entitled to vote.
The holders of Non-Voting Common Stock, as such, shall have no voting power
and shall not be entitled to vote on any matter except as otherwise required
by law or as otherwise expressly provided for herein.

  



  

(b) Except as otherwise provided herein, Non-Voting Common Stock
shall in all other respects carry the same rights and privileges as Voting
Common Stock (including in respect of dividends and in respect of
distributions upon any dissolution, liquidation or winding up of the
Corporation) and be treated the same as Voting Common Stock (including in any
merger, consolidation, share exchange, reclassification or other similar
transaction, as described in Article 5D.); _provided_ _that_ , if the
Corporation shall in any manner split, subdivide or combine (including by way
of a dividend payable in shares of Voting Common Stock or Non-Voting Common
Stock) the outstanding shares of Voting Common Stock or Non-Voting Common
Stock, the outstanding shares of the other such class of stock shall likewise
be split, subdivided or combined in the same manner proportionately and on the
same basis per share, _provided further_ , no dividend or distribution
payable in Voting Common Stock shall be declared on the Non-Voting Common
Stock and no dividend or distribution payable in Non-Voting Common Stock
shall be declared on the Voting Common Stock, but instead, in the case of a
stock dividend or distribution, each class of

  



  

   

 | 1| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

Common Stock shall receive such dividend or distribution in like stock; and 
_provided_ _further_ , if any dividend or distribution is payable in rights or
warrants to subscribe for Voting Common Stock or purchase Voting Common Stock
(including pursuant to a conversion feature in a debt or equity security), the
corresponding dividend or distribution payable on the Non-Voting Common Stock
shall consist of an identical right or warrant except that such right or
warrant shall be a right or warrant to subscribe for a number of shares of
Non-Voting Common Stock equal to the number of shares of Voting Common Stock
that would otherwise be subject to such right or warrant. The Corporation
shall not declare a dividend or distribution to the holders of the Voting
Common Stock unless a dividend or distribution (as described above) is
also made to the holders of Non-Voting Common Stock in accordance with this
Article 5B.(b). Each declared dividend or distribution shall be payable to
the holders of record of Non-Voting Common Stock at the same time as dividends
or distributions are payable to the holders of record of Voting Common Stock.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, and in addition to any other vote required by
law, the affirmative vote of a majority of the outstanding shares of Non-
Voting Common Stock, voting separately as a class, shall be required for the
Corporation to (i) increase the authorized number of shares of Non-Voting
Common Stock, (ii) enter into any agreement, contract or understanding or
otherwise incur any obligation which by its terms would violate or be in
conflict in any material respect with, or significantly and adversely affect,
the powers, rights or preferences of the Non-Voting Common Stock, (iii)
amend, alter or repeal (including by merger, consolidation or otherwise) any
provision of these Amended and Restated Articles of Incorporation or the
Bylaws of the Corporation that significantly and adversely affects the powers,
preferences or rights of the Non-Voting Common Stock, or (iv) amend or waive
any provision in these Amended and Restated Articles of Incorporation
applicable to the holders of the Non-Voting Common Stock.

  



  

C. Conversion of Common Stock.

  



  

(a) Shares of Non-Voting Common Stock may be converted into an equal
number of shares of Voting Common Stock following one or more of the
following alternatives (each, an "Approved Transfer"): (i) in a widespread
public distribution of Common stock, including pursuant to Rule 144 under the
Securities Act of 1933, as amended, (ii) upon a transfer in which no
transferee (or group of associated transferees) would receive 2% or more of
any class of Voting Securities, (iii) upon a transfer to a transferee that
would control more than 50% of the Voting Securities without any transfer
from the transferor or (iv) if the Board of Directors of the
Corporation acting in its sole and absolute discretion has approved such
conversion and such conversion would not result in the holder of such shares
beneficially owning, together with its Affiliates, more than 4.9% (or, in the
case of (a) Castle Creek Capital Partners IV, LP, and each of its respective
Affiliates, successors and assigns, including, with respect to any shares of
Non-Voting Common Stock originally issued to Castle Creek Capital Partners
IV, LP, any person to whom any such shares are sold, assigned or
otherwise transferred, or (b) GCP III EVB LLC, and each of its respective
Affiliates, successors and assigns, including, with respect to any shares of
Non-Voting Common Stock originally issued to GCP III EVB LLC, any person to
whom any such shares are sold, assigned or otherwise transferred, only, 9.9%)
of the outstanding shares of Voting Common Stock, excluding for the purpose of
this calculation any reduction in ownership resulting from any sale,
transfer, assignment or other disposition (including by merger,
reorganization, operation of law or otherwise) by such holder and its
affiliates of Voting Common Stock. The term "Voting Securities" means
capital stock of the Corporation that is then entitled to vote

  



  

   

 | 2| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

generally in the election of directors of the Corporation. The term
"Affiliate" of any specified person means any other person directly or
indirectly controlling or controlled by or under direct or indirect common
control with such specified person, including as such term is defined in
Section 2(k) of the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956, as amended. For the
purposes of this definition, "control" when used with respect to any
specified person, means the power to direct the management and policies of
such person, directly or indirectly, whether through the ownership of voting
securities, by contract or otherwise; and the terms "controlling" and
"controlled" have meanings correlative to the foregoing.

  



  

(b) Following an Approved Transfer, upon the physical surrender of
the certificate representing a share of Non-Voting Common Stock converted
pursuant to Article 5C.(a). to the Corporation, together with a written
certification to the effect that such shares of Non-Voting Common Stock are
being transferred in accordance with Article 5C.(a) (a "Transfer
Certification"), the Corporation will, or will cause its transfer agent to,
issue and deliver a new certificate, registered as the holder making the
transfer may request, representing the aggregate number of shares of Voting
Common Stock issued upon conversion of the shares of Non-Voting Common Stock
being transferred pursuant to Article 5C.(a) and represented by such
certificate ( _provided_ _that_ , if the transfer agent for the Voting Common
Stock is participating in The Depository Trust Company ("DTC") Fast Automated
Securities Transfer Program and the transferee is eligible to receive shares
through DTC, the transfer agent shall instead credit such number of full
shares of Voting Common Stock to such transferee's balance account with DTC
through its Deposit/Withdrawal at Custodian system). The failure of any
holder making the transfer of shares of Non-Voting Common Stock to deliver to
the Corporation a Transfer Certification in accordance with this Article
5C.(a). shall be deemed, for all purposes, to be a certification by such
transferor holder that such proposed transfer shall not be made in accordance
with this Article 5C.(a). In the event that less than all of the shares of
Non-Voting Common Stock represented by a certificate are transferred pursuant
to Art this Article 5C.(a), the Corporation shall promptly issue a new
certificate registered in the name of the transferor Holder representing such
remaining shares of Non-Voting Common Stock not subject to such Transfer.

  



  

(c) Upon a conversion pursuant to this Article 5C., each converted
share of Non-Voting Common Stock shall be retired. The Corporation shall from
time to time reserve for issuance the number of shares of Voting Common Stock
into which all outstanding shares of Non-Voting Common Stock may be
converted. All shares of Voting Common Stock delivered upon conversion of the
Non-Voting Common Stock shall, upon issuance, be duly authorized, validly
issued, fully paid and non-assessable, free and clear of all liens, claims,
security interests, and other encumbrances (other than liens, claims,
security interests and other encumbrances created by the applicable
holder(s)). Prior to the delivery of any securities that the Corporation
shall be obligated to deliver upon conversion of the Non-Voting Common Stock,
the Corporation shall use its reasonable best efforts to comply with any
federal and state laws and regulations thereunder requiring the registration
of such securities with, or any approval of or consent to the delivery thereof
by, any governmental authority.

  



  

(d) The Corporation hereby covenants and agrees that, if at any time
the Voting Common Stock shall be traded on the Nasdaq Global Select Market
or any other national securities exchange, the Corporation will, if permitted
by the rules of such exchange, list and keep listed, so

  



  

   

 | 3| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

long as the Voting Common Stock shall be so listed on such exchange, all the
Voting Common Stock issuable upon conversion of the Non-Voting Common Stock;
_provided_ , _however_ , that if the rules of such exchange require the
Corporation to defer the listing of such Voting Common Stock until the first
conversion of the Non-Voting Common Stock into Voting Common Stock in
accordance with the provisions hereof, the Corporation covenants to list such
Voting Common Stock issuable upon conversion of the Non-Voting Common Stock
in accordance with the requirements of such exchange at such time.

  



  

(e) The Corporation shall not close its books against the transfer
of Non-Voting Common Stock or of Voting Common Stock issued or issuable upon
conversion of Non-Voting Common Stock in any manner which interferes with the
timely conversion of Non-Voting Common Stock. The Corporation shall assist
and cooperate with any holder of Non-Voting Common Stock required to make any
governmental filings or obtain any governmental approval prior to or in
connection with any conversion of Non-Voting Common Stock hereunder
(including, without limitation, making any governmental filings required to
be made by the Corporation), but the Corporation shall not be obligated to
reimburse any holder of Non-Voting Common Stock for expenses incurred in
connection therewith.

  



  

(f) If any fractional interest in a share of capital stock would,
except as otherwise required by this Article 5C, be delivered upon any
conversion of the Non-Voting Common Stock, the Corporation, in lieu of
delivering the fractional share therefor, shall pay an amount to the
holder thereof equal to the market value of such fractional interest as of
the date of conversion.

  



  

D. Mergers, Etc. In the event of any recapitalization, reorganization,
reclassification, consolidation, merger, sale of all or substantially all
of the Corporation's assets, exchange or tender offer by the Corporation or
any of its subsidiaries, or other transaction, in each case which is effected
in such a manner that the holders of Common Stock are entitled to receive
(either directly or upon subsequent liquidation and whether automatically or
at their election) stock, securities or assets with respect to or in
exchange for Common Stock, each share of Non-Voting Common Stock will at the
same time be similarly exchanged or changed in an amount per whole share
equal to the aggregate amount of stock, securities or assets, as the case may
be, that each share of Voting Common Stock would be entitled to receive as a
result of such transaction, provided that at the election of such holder, any
securities issued with respect to the Non-Voting Common Stock shall be non-
voting securities under the resulting corporation's organizational documents
and the Corporation shall make appropriate provisions (in form and substance
reasonably satisfactory to the holders of a majority of the Non-Voting Common
Stock then outstanding) and take such actions necessary to ensure that holders
of the Non-Voting Common Stock shall retain securities with substantially the
same privileges, limitations and relative rights as the Non-Voting Common
Stock. Subject to the foregoing, in the event the holders of Voting Common
Stock are provided the right to convert or exchange Voting Common Stock for
stock, securities or assets, then the holders of the Non-Voting Common Stock
shall be provided the same right based upon the number of shares of Voting
Common Stock such

  



  

   

 | 4| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

holders would be entitled to receive if such shares of Non-Voting Common
Stock were converted into shares of Voting Common Stock immediately prior to
such offering. In the event that the Corporation offers to repurchase shares
of Voting Common Stock from its shareholders generally, the Corporation shall
offer to repurchase Non-Voting Common Stock pro rata based upon the number of
shares of Voting Common Stock such holders would be entitled to receive if
such shares were converted into shares of Voting Common Stock immediately
prior to such repurchase. In the event of any pro rata subscription offer,
rights offer or similar offer to holders of Voting Common Stock, the
Corporation shall provide the holders of the Non-Voting Common Stock the
right to participate based upon the number of shares of Voting Common Stock
such holders would be entitled to receive if such shares were converted into
shares of Voting Common Stock immediately prior to such offering; provided
that at the election of such holder, any shares issued with respect to the
Non-Voting Common Stock shall be issued in the form of Non-Voting Common
Stock rather than Voting Common Stock.

  



  

E. The Preferred Stock. The Board of Directors is hereby expressly
authorized, by resolution or resolutions to provide, out of the unissued
shares of Preferred Stock, for series of Preferred Stock. Before any shares
of any such series are issued, the Board of Directors shall fix, and hereby
is expressly empowered to fix, by resolution or resolutions, the following
provisions of the shares thereof:

  



  

(a) the designation of such series, the number of shares to constitute such
series and the stated value thereof if different from the par value thereof;

  



  

(b) whether the shares of such series shall have voting rights, in addition
to any voting rights provided by law, and, if so, the terms of such
voting rights, which may be general or limited;

  



  

(c) the dividends, if any, payable on such series, whether any such dividends
shall be cumulative, and, if so, from what dates, the conditions and
dates upon which such dividends shall be payable, and the preference or
relation which such dividends shall bear to the dividends payable on any
shares of stock of any other class or any other series of this class;

  



  

(d) whether the shares of such series shall be subject to redemption by the
Corporation, and, if so, the times, prices and other conditions of such
redemption;

  



  

(e) the amount or amounts payable upon shares of such series upon, and the
rights of the holders of such series in, the voluntary or involuntary
liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Corporation, or upon any
distribution of the assets of the Corporation;

  



  

(f) whether the shares of such series shall be subject to the operation of a
retirement or sinking fund and, if so, the extent to and manner in which any
such retirement or sinking fund shall be applied to the purchase or redemption
of the shares of such series for retirement or other corporate purposes and
the terms and provisions relative to the operation thereof;

  



  

(g) whether the shares of such series shall be convertible into, or
exchangeable for, shares of stock of any other class or any other series of
this class or any other securities, and, if so, the price or prices or the
rate or rates of conversion or exchange and the method, if any, of adjusting
the same, and any other terms and conditions of conversion or exchange;

  



  

(h) the limitations and restrictions, if any, to be effective while any
shares of such series are outstanding upon the payment of dividends or the
making of other distributions on, and

  



  

   

 | 5| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

upon the purchase, redemption or other acquisition by the Corporation of, the
Common Stock or shares of stock of any other class or any other series of
this class;

  



  

(i) the conditions or restrictions, if any, upon the creation of indebtedness
of the Corporation or upon the issue of any additional stock,
including additional shares of such series or of any other series of this
class or of any other class; and

  



  

(j) any other powers, preferences and relative, participating, optional and
other special rights, and any qualifications, limitations and
restrictions thereof.

  



  

The powers, preferences and relative, participating, optional and other
special rights of each series of Preferred Stock, and the qualifications,
limitations or restrictions thereof, if any, may differ from those of any and
all other series at any time outstanding. All shares of any one series of
Preferred Stock shall be identical in all respects with all other shares of
such series, except that shares of any one series issued at different times
may differ as to the dates from which dividends thereon shall accrue and/or be
cumulative. Shares of the capital stock of the Corporation may be issued from
time to time as authorized by the Board of Directors without further approval
of the stockholders except to the extent such approval is required by
governing law, rule or regulation.

  



  

Article 6. Preemptive Rights. No holder of the capital stock of the
Corporation shall be entitled as such, as a matter of right, to subscribe
for or purchase any part of any new or additional issue of stock of any class
whatsoever of the Corporation, or of treasury shares, or of securities
convertible into stock of any class whatsoever, whether now or hereafter
authorized, or whether issued for cash or other consideration or by way of a
dividend.

  



  

Article 7. Directors. The business and affairs of the Corporation shall be
managed by or under the direction of a Board of Directors.

  



  

A. Term. Commencing with the 2006 annual meeting of stockholders, the
directors shall be divided, with respect to the time for which they
severally hold office, into three classes, as nearly equal in number as
possible, with the term of office of the first class, which will consist of
Robin R. Shield and R. Roderick Porter, to expire at the 2007 annual meeting
of stockholders, the term of office of the second class, which will consist
of Michael A. Gaffney and John J. Forch, to expire at the 2008 annual meeting
of stockholders, and the term of office of the third class, which will
consist of Neil J. Call, Georgia S. Derrico and Charles A. Kabbash, to
expire at the 2009 annual meeting of stockholders, with each director to hold
office until his successor shall have been duly elected and qualified. At
each annual meeting of stockholders commencing with the 2007 annual meeting of
stockholders, directors elected to succeed those directors whose terms then
expire shall be elected for a term of office to expire at the third succeeding
annual meeting of stockholders after their election, with each director to
hold office until his successor shall have been duly elected and qualified.
Stockholders of the Corporation shall not be permitted to cumulate their votes
for the election of directors.

  



  

B. Vacancies. Except as otherwise fixed pursuant to the provisions of Article
5E. hereof relating to the rights of the holders of any class or series of
stock having a preference over the Common Stock as to dividends or upon
liquidation to elect directors, any vacancy occurring in the Board of
Directors, including any vacancy created by reason of an increase in the
number of

  



  

   

 | 6| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

directors, may be filled by the affirmative vote of a majority of the
directors then in office, whether or not a quorum is present, or by a sole
remaining director, and any director so chosen shall hold office for the
remainder of the term to which the director has been selected and until such
director's successor shall have been elected and qualified. No decrease in the
number of directors shall shorten the term of any incumbent director.

  



  

C. Removal. Subject to the rights of any class or series of stock having
preference over the Common Stock as to dividends or upon liquidation to
elect directors, any director (including persons elected by the directors to
fill vacancies in the Board of Directors) may be removed from office only
with cause by an affirmative vote of not less than 75% of the shares of the
Corporation entitled to vote generally in an election of directors (the
"Voting Shares") at a duly constituted meeting of stockholders called
expressly for such purpose. Cause for removal shall exist only if the
director whose removal is proposed has been either declared incompetent by an
order of a court, convicted of a felony or of an offense punishable by
imprisonment for a term of more than one year by a court of competent
jurisdiction, or deemed liable by a court of competent jurisdiction for gross
negligence or misconduct in the performance of such director's duties to the
Corporation. At least 30 days prior to such meeting of stockholders,
written notice shall be sent to the director whose removal will be considered
at the meeting.

  



  

D. Evaluation of Acquisition Proposals. The Board of Directors of the
Corporation, when evaluating any offer to the Corporation or to the
stockholders of the Corporation from another party to (a) purchase for cash,
or exchange any securities or property for, any outstanding equity securities
of the Corporation, (b) merge or consolidate the Corporation with another
corporation or (c) purchase or otherwise acquire all or substantially all of
the properties and assets of the Corporation, may, consistent with the
exercise of its fiduciary duties and in connection with the exercise of its
judgment in determining what is in the best interest of the Corporation and
its stockholders, give due consideration to the extent permitted by law not
only to the price or other consideration being offered, but also to all other
relevant factors including, without limitation, the financial and managerial
resources and future prospects of the other party, the possible effects on
the business of the Corporation and its subsidiaries and on the employees,
customers, suppliers and creditors of the Corporation and its subsidiaries,
the effects on the ability of the Corporation to fulfill its
corporate objectives as a holding company and on the ability of its
subsidiary bank to fulfill its objectives as a bank, and the effects on the
communities in which the Corporation's and its subsidiaries' facilities are
located.

  



  

Article 8. Liability of Directors and Officers. The personal liability of the
directors and officers of the Corporation for monetary damages shall be
eliminated to the fullest extent permitted by the Stock Corporation Act of the
Commonwealth of Virginia. No amendment, modification or repeal of this
Article 8 shall adversely affect the rights provided hereby with respect to
any claim, issue or matter in any proceeding that is based in any respect on
any alleged action or failure to act prior to such amendment, modification or
repeal.

  



  

Article 9. Indemnification. The Corporation shall indemnify its directors,
officers, employees, agents and former directors, officers, employees and
agents, and any other persons serving at the request of the Corporation as a
director, officer, employee or agent of another corporation, association,
partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise, against expenses
(including attorneys' fees, judgments, fines and amounts paid in settlement)
incurred in connection

with any pending or threatened action, suit or proceeding, whether civil,
criminal, administrative or investigative, with respect to which such
director, officer, employee, agent or other person is a party, or is
threatened to be made a party, to the full extent permitted by the Stock
Corporation Act of the Commonwealth of Virginia. The indemnification provided
herein (i) shall not be deemed exclusive of any other right to which any
person seeking indemnification may be entitled under any bylaw, agreement or
vote of stockholders or disinterested directors or otherwise, both as to
action in his or her official capacity and as to action in any other capacity,
and (ii) shall inure to the benefit of the heirs, executors and
administrators of any such person. The Corporation shall have the power, but
shall not be obligated, to purchase and maintain insurance on behalf of any
person or persons enumerated above against any liability asserted against
or incurred by them or any of them arising out of their status as corporate
directors, officers, employees, or agents whether or not the Corporation
would have the power to indemnify them against such liability under the
provisions of this Article 9.

  



  

Article 10. Special Meetings of Stockholders. Except as otherwise required by
law and subject to the rights of the holders of any class or series of
Preferred Stock, special meetings of the stockholders may be called only by
the Chairman of the Board, by the President, by the Board of Directors
pursuant to a resolution approved by the affirmative vote of at least three-
fourths of the directors then in office, or by the holders of record of not
less than forty percent (40%) of the then outstanding Voting Shares.

  



  

Article 11. Consent of Stockholders in Lieu of a Meeting. Any action required
to be taken by the stockholders at any annual or special meeting of such
stockholders, or any action which may be taken at any annual or special
meeting of stockholders of this Corporation, may be taken without a meeting,
without prior notice and without a vote, if a consent or consents in writing,
setting forth the action so taken, shall be signed by the holders of shares
having not less than the minimum number of votes that would be necessary
to authorize or take such action at a meeting at which all shares entitled to
vote thereon were present and voted and shall be delivered to the Corporation
by delivery to its principal office.

  



  

Article 12. Election By Corporation. The Corporation expressly elects not to
be governed by Article 14, Section 13.1-725 _et seq._
("Affiliated Transactions") and Article 14, Section 13.1-728.1 _et seq_.
("Control Share Acquisitions"), both of the Stock Corporation Act of the
Commonwealth of Virginia (or any successor to such statute).

  



  

Article 13. Amendment of Articles of Incorporation and Bylaws.

  



  

A. Articles of Incorporation. The Corporation reserves the right to amend,
alter, change or repeal any provision contained in these Amended and Restated
Articles of Incorporation, in the manner now or hereafter prescribed by law,
and all rights conferred upon stockholders herein are granted subject to this
reservation. Except as otherwise permitted by statute, no amendment, addition,
alteration, change or repeal of these Amended and Restated Articles of
Incorporation shall be made unless it is first approved by the Board of
Directors of the Corporation pursuant to a resolution adopted by the
affirmative vote of a majority of the directors then in office, and is
thereafter approved by the affirmative vote of a majority of the Voting
Shares, voting together as a single class, as well as such additional vote of
the Preferred Stock as may be required by the provisions of any series
thereof.

  



  

   

 | 8| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

B. Bylaws. The Board of Directors or stockholders may adopt, alter, amend or
repeal the Bylaws of the Corporation. Such action by the Board of Directors
shall require the affirmative vote of a majority of the directors then in
office at any regular or special meeting of the Board of Directors. Such
action by the stockholders shall require the affirmative vote of at least a
majority of the Voting Shares, as well as such additional vote of the
Preferred Stock as may be required by the provisions of any series thereof.
