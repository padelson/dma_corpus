\- 27 -  Section 3.14 _Interim Large Losses Events_.

 

(a) If there exists any Interim Large Losses Event, the Company shall, no
later than three (3) Business Days prior to the Closing Date, deliver to
Parent a statement (which the Company shall update, if necessary, immediately
prior to the Effective Time) (the " _Company Interim Large Losses Statement_
") setting forth its good faith estimate of the losses to the Group Companies
under In-Force Insurance Agreement(s), net of any reinsurance recoverables
under any Outbound Reinsurance Agreement(s) and other recoverables and
indemnifications, for each Interim Large Losses Event as of the Closing Date
calculated in accordance with GAAP and the historical reserving practices of
the Group Companies (the " _Estimated Large Losses_ "). The Company Interim
Large Losses Statement shall also include: (i) the difference (but not less
than zero) between (x) the aggregate amount of the Estimated Large Losses for
all Interim Large Losses Events less (y) $25,000,000 (the " _Estimated Excess
Large Losses_ ") and (ii) the dollar amount equal to 1.5 times the
Estimated Excess Large Losses (the " _Escrowed Large Losses_ "), provided,
however, that if such number is greater than zero but less than $20,000,000
(the " _Large Losses Escrow Minimum_ "), the Escrowed Large Losses shall equal
the Large Losses Escrow Minimum.

(b) Concurrent with the Effective Time, Parent shall deduct the Escrowed Large
Losses from the cash portion of the Closing Payment Amount due to the Paying
Agent pursuant to _Section 3.6_ and deposit the Escrowed Large Losses into
the Escrow Account, which amount will be segregated and held separate from the
Escrow Amount. The Escrowed Large Losses shall be deposited solely in the
form of cash. In the event of any such deposit into the Escrow Account, the
Parent and the Securityholders Representative shall amend the Escrow
Agreement on or prior to the Closing, in such form as agreed to among Parent
and the Securityholders Representative, to provide for the deposit into, and
the release of the Escrowed Large Losses from, the Escrow Account in
accordance with this _Section 3.14_.

 

(c) Within thirty (30) days following the Closing Date, or, in the event that
the Company Interim Large Losses Statements includes a Natural Catastrophe,
within ninety (90) days following the Closing Date, Parent shall prepare and
deliver to the Securityholders Representative a statement (the " _Closing
Interim Large Losses Statement_ "), together with reasonable supporting
documentation therefor, setting forth its determination of the actual losses
to the Group Companies under In-Force Insurance Agreement(s), net of any
reinsurance recoverables under any Outbound Reinsurance Agreement(s)
and other recoverables and indemnifications, for each Interim Large Losses
Events as of the Closing Date, calculated in accordance with GAAP and the
historical reserving practices (prior to the Closing Date) of the Group
Companies, and using the lower of the best estimate and the midpoint of its
actuarys range estimate (the " _Re-Estimated Large Losses_ "). The Closing
Interim Large Losses Statement shall also include the difference (but not less
than zero) between (i) the aggregate amount of the Re-Estimated Large Losses
for all Interim Large Losses Events less (ii) $25,000,000 (the " _Excess Large
Losses_ ").

 



\- 28 -  (d) Within thirty (30) days following receipt by the
Securityholders Representative of the Closing Interim Large Losses
Statement, the Securityholders Representative shall deliver written notice
(an " _Objection Notice_ ") to Parent of any dispute it has with respect to
the preparation or content of the Closing Interim Large Losses Statement. Any
amount, determination or calculation contained in the Closing Interim Large
Losses Statement and not specifically disputed in a timely delivered Objection
Notice shall be final, conclusive and binding on the Parties. If the
Securityholders Representative does not timely deliver an Objection Notice
with respect to the Closing Interim Large Losses Statement within such thirty
(30) day period, the Closing Interim Large Losses Statement will be final,
conclusive and binding on the Parties. If an Objection Notice is timely
delivered within such thirty (30) day period, Parent and the Securityholders
Representative shall negotiate in good faith to resolve each dispute raised
therein (each, an " _Objection_ "). If Parent and the Securityholders
Representative, notwithstanding such good faith efforts, fail to resolve any
Objections within fifteen (15) days after the Securityholders Representative
delivers an Objection Notice, then Parent and the Securityholders
Representative shall jointly engage Milliman (the " _Actuarial Firm_ ") to
resolve such disputes (acting as an expert and not an arbitrator) in
accordance with this Agreement as soon as practicable thereafter (but in any
event within thirty (30) days after engagement of the Actuarial Firm). Parent
and the Securityholders Representative shall cause the Actuarial Firm to
deliver a written report containing its calculation of the disputed Objections
(which calculation shall be within the range of dispute between the Closing
Interim Large Losses Statement and the Objection Notice) within such
thirty (30) day period. All Objections that are resolved between the Parties
or are determined by the Actuarial Firm will be final, conclusive and binding
on the Parties. The fees and disbursements of the Actuarial Firm shall be
allocated to the Securityholders Representative in the same proportion that
the aggregate amount of such remaining disputed items so submitted to the
Actuarial Firm that is unsuccessfully disputed by the Securityholders
Representative (as finally determined by the Actuarial Firm) bears to the
total amount of such remaining disputed items so submitted, if any, and the
balance shall be paid by Parent. Parent and the Securityholders
Representative shall enter into an engagement letter with the Actuarial Firm
promptly after its retention, which includes customary indemnification and
other provisions.

(e) Parent shall, and shall cause each Group Company to, make its financial
and actuarial records, actuarial personnel and advisors available to the
Securityholders Representative (including any actuaries or other
representatives of the Securityholders Representative) and the Actuarial
Firm at reasonable times during the review by the Securityholders
Representative and the Actuarial Firm of, and the resolution of any Objections
with respect to, the Closing Interim Large Losses Statement.

(f) _Adjustments_.

 

(i) If the Excess Large Losses for all Interim Large Losses Events as finally
determined pursuant to  _Section 3.14(d)_ (the " _Final Excess Large Losses_
") exceeds the Estimated Excess Large Losses for such Interim Large Losses
Events (the amount of such excess, the " _Additional Large Losses_ "), then
within three (3) Business Days after the date on which the Final Excess Large
Losses are finally determined, Parent and the Securityholders Representative
shall deliver joint written instructions to the Escrow Agent instructing the
Escrow Agent to disburse from the Escrowed Large Losses (A) a

 



\- 29 -   cash amount to Parent equal to the sum of (1) the Estimated Excess Large
Losses _plus_ (2) the Additional Large Losses, provided that if the foregoing
sum is greater than the Escrowed Large Losses, the joint written instructions
shall provide for the entire Escrowed Large Losses to be disbursed to Parent
and (B) an amount to the Paying Agent (for distribution to the Company Equity
Securityholders) equal to any remaining Escrowed Large Losses after making
the disbursement contemplated by clause (A), it being understood and agreed
that upon the release of the remaining portion of the Escrowed Large Losses to
the Company Equity Securityholders, each such holder shall be entitled to
receive in cash (x) the amount of such remaining portion of the Escrowed Large
Losses multiplied by (y) such Company Equity Securityholders Pro Rata
Portion.

 

(ii) If the Final Excess Large Losses for all Interim Large Losses Events are
less than the Estimated Large Losses for such Interim Large Losses Events
(the amount of such deficiency, the " _Large Losses Deficiency_ "), then
within three (3) Business Days after the date on which the Final Excess Large
Losses are finally determined, Parent and the Securityholders Representative
shall deliver joint written instructions to the Escrow Agent instructing the
Escrow Agent to disburse from the Escrowed Large Losses (A) an amount to
Parent equal to the difference between (1) the Estimated Excess Large Losses
less (2) the Large Losses Deficiency, and (B) an amount to the Paying Agent
(for distribution to the Company Equity Securityholders) equal to any
remaining Escrowed Large Losses after making the disbursement contemplated by
clause (A), it being understood and agreed that upon the release of the
remaining portion of the Escrowed Large Losses to the Company Equity
Securityholders, each such holder shall be entitled to receive in cash (x) the
amount of such remaining portion of the Escrowed Large Losses multiplied by
(y) such Company Equity Securityholders Pro Rata Portion.

(g) Parent acknowledges and agrees that its recovery from the Escrowed Large
Losses in the Escrow Account in accordance with this _Section 3.14_ shall be
its sole and exclusive remedy with respect to any Interim Large Losses
Events. Parent acknowledges that (i) it has reviewed information relating to
the Excluded Large Losses Events and any events that have occurred prior to
January 1, 2013 that may be potentially covered under the Insurance
Agreements of the Group Companies (the " _Pre-2013 Events_ "), and that it has
fully considered such information and factored such information into its
Purchase Price (including any potential adverse development in losses and
reserves that may result from such Excluded Large Losses Events or Pre-2013
Events), (ii) it has had the opportunity to discuss such Excluded Large Losses
Events and Pre-2013 Events with the Companys management (including
its actuarial staff) and to fully review such Excluded Large Losses Events
and Pre-2013 Events prior to the date hereof and (iii) except to the extent
that Parent or any Parent Indemnitee expressly has any rights under this
Agreement with respect thereto by reason of the Companys representations and
warranties in Article IV hereof, Parent shall have no rights under this
Agreement, including this _Section 3.14_, or otherwise with respect to any
Excluded Large Losses Events or Pre-2013 Events or with respect to any
adverse development in the losses or reserves relating to any such Excluded
Large Losses Events or Pre-2013 Events.

 



\- 30 -  Section 3.15 _Founder Amalgamation Stock Consideration_.

 

(a) The Founder Amalgamation Stock Consideration shall be in the form of
voting ordinary shares, par value $1.00 per share, of Parent except, with
respect to the Founder Amalgamation Stock Consideration issuable to First
Reserve, to the extent otherwise provided for in this Section 3.15.

(b) In the event that the number of voting ordinary shares, par value $1.00
per share, of Parent deliverable to First Reserve at the Closing pursuant to
_Section 3.1_ would cause First Reserve, as of immediately after the
Closing, to beneficially own shares of Parent that constitute more than nine
and one-half percent (9.5%) of the voting power of all shares of Parent (after
giving effect to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement), Parent
shall issue to First Reserve, at the Closing, the total number of shares of
Parent Common Stock that First Reserve is entitled to pursuant to _Section
3.1_ in the form of (i) voting ordinary shares, par value $1.00 per share, of
Parent, representing nine and one-half percent (9.5%) of the voting power of
all shares of Parent as of immediately after the Closing (after giving effect
to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement) and (ii) Parent Series B
Non-Voting Preferred Stock, representing the remainder of the shares that
First Reserve is entitled to pursuant to _Section 3.1_.

(c) In the event that First Reserve is issued shares of Parent Series B Non-
Voting Preferred Stock at the Closing pursuant to _Section 3.15(b)_, the
Founder Escrow Stock Amount allocable to First Reserve (equal to First
Reserves "Founder Pro Rata Portion" (as defined in the Escrow Agreement)
multiplied by the Founder Escrow Stock Amount) shall be solely in the form of
Parent Series B Non-Voting Preferred Stock, and any release of the Founder
Escrow Stock Amount to First Reserve pursuant to the Escrow Agreement shall be
solely in the form of Parent Series B Non-Voting Preferred Stock (while any
release of the Founder Escrow Stock Amount to Corsair pursuant to the Escrow
Agreement shall be solely in the form of voting ordinary shares of Parent).

(d) In the event that First Reserve is not issued shares of Parent Series B
Non-Voting Preferred Stock at the Closing pursuant to _Section 3.15(b)_, but
the aggregate number of shares of Parent Common Stock deliverable to First
Reserve at the Closing pursuant to Section 3.1 and upon release of the
Founder Escrow Stock Amount would cause First Reserve, as of immediately after
the Closing, to beneficially own shares of Parent that constitute more than
nine and one-half percent (9.5%) of the voting power of all shares of Parent
(after giving effect to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and
assuming the Founder Escrow Stock Amount were issued as of the Closing), the
Founder Escrow Stock Amount allocable to First Reserve (equal to
First Reserves "Founder Pro Rata Portion" (as defined in the Escrow
Agreement) multiplied by the Founder Escrow Stock Amount) shall be in the form
of (i) voting ordinary shares, par value $1.00 per share, of Parent, such that
the number of voting ordinary shares deliverable to First Reserve at the
Closing pursuant to _Section 3.1_ and the number of voting ordinary shares
allocable to First Reserve as part of the Founder Escrow Stock Amount
represents nine and one-half percent (9.5%) of the voting power of all shares
of Parent as of immediately after the Closing (after giving effect to the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and assuming the Founder Escrow
Stock Amount were issued as of the Closing) and (ii) Parent Series B Non-
Voting Preferred Stock, representing the remainder of the shares that First
Reserve is entitled to as its allocable portion of the Founder Escrow Stock
Amount.

(Jersey) Limited (the " _Employee Trust_ "). Of the Company Class B Shares
held by the Employee Trust, (i) 3,845,984 of such Company Class B Shares have
not been allocated or otherwise designated to any Person by the Company, the
Employee Trust or the Ogier Employee Benefit Trustee Limited, which serves as
trustee for the Employee Trust (the " _Employee Trustee_ "), and no Person

Company Class B Shares_ "), and (ii) 1,000,000 of such Company Class B Shares
have been allocated or otherwise designated (with the Employee Trust
retaining joint ownership thereof) to certain individuals who are current or
former officers or employees of the Company (the " _Allocated Company Class B
Shares_ "), of which (x) 400,000 have been structured in the form of
restricted stock units and are being treated as Company RSUs for purposes of
this Agreement and (y) 600,000 have been issued subject to the arrangements
described below in subsection (g) (clause (y), the " _Allocated Company Class
B Share Interests_ ").

(e) The Company intends to redeem and cancel the Unallocated Company Class B
Shares prior to the Effective Time such that immediately prior to the
Effective Time there shall be no Unallocated Company Class B Shares
outstanding and, assuming such redemption occurs, no consideration under this
Agreement or otherwise (other than the cancellation and forgiveness of the
amount outstanding under the Loan Facility corresponding to such redeemed
Unallocated Company Class B Shares) will be owed by Parent, Amalgamation Sub,
the Amalgamated Company or any Group Company to any holder or purported
holder of any interest in such Unallocated Company Class B Shares. As of the
date hereof, the amount of the loan under the Loan Facility that corresponds
to the Unallocated Company Class B Shares is greater than the amount of the
Total Per Share Amalgamation Consideration payable under this Agreement in
respect of such Unallocated Company Class B Shares.

 



\- 34 -  (f) If at the Effective Time any Unallocated Company Class B Shares have not
been redeemed, Parent and Amalgamation Sub shall be entitled pursuant to the

documents related to the Unallocated Company Class B Shares to pay the
consideration provided for in this Agreement with respect to such Unallocated
Company Class B Shares to the Company as contemplated by _Section
3.1(a)(i)(C)_ and, following the Effective Time, such consideration then held
by the Company shall be unrestricted and available for use by the Company for
its general corporate purposes. At the Effective Time, the amount of the loan
under the Loan Facility that corresponds to any unredeemed Unallocated Company
Class B Shares will be greater than the Total Per Share Amalgamation

Company Class B Shares. From and after the Effective Time, no holder or
purported holder of any interest in any Unallocated Company Class B Share is
or will be owed any consideration under this Agreement or otherwise.

(g) The terms and conditions upon which the Allocated Company Class B Share
Interests were issued provide that the holder of any interest in such
Allocated Company Class B Share Interests shall only be entitled to realize
any value for such Allocated Company Class B Share Interests if their value
exceeds certain specified threshold amounts. The Total Per Share Amalgamation
Consideration will not exceed such threshold amount applicable to any
Allocated Company Class B Share Interest, therefore, pursuant to the terms of
all plans, awards, agreements, certificates and trust documents related to
the Allocated Company Class B Share Interests, Parent and Amalgamation Sub are
entitled to pay the consideration provided for in this Agreement with respect
to such Allocated Company Class B Share Interests to the Company as
contemplated by _Section 3.1(a)(i)(C)_ and, following the Effective Time,
such consideration then held by the Company shall be unrestricted and
available for use by the Company for its general corporate purposes. From and
after the Effective Time, no holder or purported holder of any interest in any
Allocated Company Class B Share Interest is or will be owed any consideration
under this Agreement or otherwise.

 

(h) The Employee Trustee is the borrower under the Loan Facility . No amount
borrowed by the Employee Trustee for its own account or on behalf of the
Employee Trust or the beneficiaries thereof has been recorded as a receivable
or other asset in the Company Financial Statements. All loan amounts
outstanding under the Loan Facility are valid, binding and collectible, and
Parent and Amalgamation Sub shall be entitled to credit against such loan any
and all consideration payable hereunder with respect to the Company Class B
Shares (except the 400,000 Company Class B Shares treated as if they were
Company RSUs under this Agreement), and neither Parent, Amalgamation Sub nor
the Company shall be obligated to pay in cash any amounts to the Company, the
Employee Trustee or the Employee Trust in respect of such Company Class B
Shares, but shall instead be entitled to credit any and all such payments
against the amount outstanding under the Loan Facility.

duly adopted and in effect as of the date hereof and the Closing Date,

\- 39 -  (b) The Company has provided to Parent correct and complete copies of all
Company Material Contracts, including any amendments thereto. Each Company
Material Contract is valid and binding on the applicable Group Company, in

Company Material Contract is insolvent or the subject of a rehabilitation,
liquidation, conservatorship, receivership, bankruptcy or similar proceeding.
Neither the execution of this Agreement nor the consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereunder shall constitute a default under, give
rise to cancellation rights under, or otherwise adversely affect any of the
material rights of any Group Company under any Company Material Contract. 

Section 4.7 _Absence of Changes; Undisclosed Liabilities_.

contemplated by this Agreement, (i) there has not been any event, change,
occurrence or circumstance that has had or would reasonably be expected to
have a Company Material Adverse Effect and (ii) each Group Company has
conducted its business in the ordinary course of business. Since the date
of the Latest Company Balance Sheet, there has not been any action taken by
the Company or any other Group Company that, if taken during the period from
the date of this Agreement through the Closing Date without Parents consent,
would constitute a breach of _Section 6.1(a)(ii)_, _(iv)_ , _(v)_ , _(vii)_
, _(xi)_ , _(xiii)_ , _(xix)_ or _(xxv)_.

(b) No Group Company has any material liability or obligation of any kind
whatsoever in existence, whether accrued, contingent, absolute or otherwise,

and obligations as reflected or reserved against in the Latest
Company Balance Sheet (including in any of the notes thereto) or (ii)
liabilities and obligations that have arisen since the date of the Latest
Company Balance Sheet in the ordinary course of business; provided, however, 

 



\- 40 -   that it is acknowledged and agreed by the Company, Parent and Amalgamation
Sub that no Group Company is making any representation or warranty (express or
implied) as to the adequacy or sufficiency of reserves for claims, losses
(including incurred, but not reported, losses), loss adjustment expenses
(whether allocated or unallocated) and unearned premiums as of any date.

 

Section 4.8 _Litigation_. As of the date of this Agreement, there is no suit,
litigation, arbitration, claim, action or proceeding pending or, to the
Companys knowledge, threatened or under investigation against any Group
Company, any material property or material asset of any Group Company, or, to
the Companys knowledge, any present or former officer or director of any
Group Company before any Governmental Entity (relating to actions of such
Person in his or her capacity as an officer or director of any Group Company),
which (a) has had or would reasonably be expected to be material to any Group
Company, (b) could, in any material respect, prohibit or restrict any Group
Company from operating its business as currently operated or (c) that could
reasonably be expected to prevent or materially delay the consummation of

material permits, licenses, approvals, certificates and other authorizations
of and from, and have made all declarations and filings with, all Governmental
Entities necessary for the lawful conduct of their respective businesses as
presently conducted (the " _Company Material Permits_ "). No Group Company is
in material default or violation of any Company Material Permit to which it is
a party and no event has occurred that would reasonably be expected to cause a
revocation, suspension, lapse or other limitation of any Company Material
Permit. Since January 1, 2012, the business of the Group Companies has been
operated in material compliance with all applicable Laws of all Governmental
Entities. Without limitation of the foregoing, each of the Company Insurance
Subsidiaries is marketing or selling insurance products in compliance with
insurance Laws applicable to the business of such Company Insurance Subsidiary

Subsidiary.

Employee Benefit Plan. With respect to each Company Employee Benefit Plan, the

Company has withdrawn at any time within the preceding six (6) years from any
Multiemployer Plan, or incurred any withdrawal liability which remains

Company. No Company Employee Benefit Plan is subject to Title IV of ERISA or

Company, other than health continuation coverage mandated by applicable Law,
including, without limitation, under COBRA or similar non-U.S. Law.

(c) Each Company Employee Benefit Plan has been maintained and administered in
compliance in all material respects with the applicable requirements of
ERISA, the Code and any other applicable Laws. Each Company Employee Benefit

received a favorable determination from the Internal Revenue Service or is
the subject of a favorable opinion from the Internal Revenue Service on the
form of such Company Employee Benefit Plan and, to the Companys knowledge,
there are no facts or circumstances that would be reasonably likely to
adversely affect the qualified status of any such Company Employee Benefit
Plan.

(d) Except as set forth on Schedule 4.10(d), neither the execution and
delivery of this Agreement nor the consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby will (either alone or in combination with another event)
result in the payment of any amount that would, individually or in
combination with any other such payment, not be deductible as a result of
Section 280G of the Code.

jurisdiction outside of the United States (i) have been maintained in

fifteen (15) Business Days before the Closing, the Company shall update
Schedule 4.10(f) to reflect any employees whose employment has terminated and
any other change in the information on _Schedule 4.10(f)_.

_Schedule 4.12(a)_ sets forth a complete and correct list of all (i) patents,
trademarks and service marks, copyrights, internet domain names, registrations
and applications for Group Company IP Rights owned or licensed by any Group
Company, all of which are subsisting and, to the Companys knowledge, valid,
and (ii) material software products owned or licensed by any Group Company.

(b) There is not pending or threatened in writing against any Group Company
any claim by any third party contesting the use or ownership of any material
Group Company IP Right owned by such Group Company, or alleging that any Group
Company is infringing any Intellectual Property Rights of a third party, and
there are no claims pending or threatened in writing that have been brought by
any Group Company against any third party alleging infringement of any
Intellectual Property Rights owned by such Group Company. The conduct of the
business of the Group Companies as currently conducted does not infringe any
Intellectual Property Rights of any third party and, to the Companys
knowledge, no third party is infringing any material Group Company IP
Rights. 

(c) _Schedule 4.12(c)_ sets forth a list of all material agreements pertaining
to the Group Company IP Rights, other than (i) agreements for the use of
commercially available software and (ii) customer agreements entered into by
any Group Company in the ordinary course of business (collectively, the "

Agreement, except for defaults that have not had or reasonably would not be
expected to have a Company Material Adverse Effect. 

(d) The Group Companies have taken commercially reasonable steps to maintain

commercially reasonably security programs that are intended to protect the

Bermuda Monetary Authority) for the year ended December 31, 2012 and the
quarterly period ended March 31, 2013, together with all
exhibits, interrogatories, notes, schedules and actuarial opinions,
affirmations or certificates related thereto or required in connection
therewith (such statutory statements and materials, the " _Parent Statutory
Financial Statements_ "). Each Parent Insurance Subsidiary has filed or
submitted all Parent Statutory Financial Statements required to be filed with
or submitted to the appropriate insurance regulatory authorities of the
jurisdiction in which it is domiciled on forms prescribed or permitted by
such authority, except for such failures to file that would not reasonably be
expected to be material to the Parent Insurance Subsidiaries taken as a whole.
The Parent Statutory Financial Statements (i) have been prepared in
all material respects in accordance with SAP applied on a consistent basis
throughout the periods covered thereby, except as may be indicated in the
notes thereto and (ii) fairly present, in all material respects, the statutory
financial position of the applicable Parent Insurance Subsidiary as of the
dates thereof and their results of operations for the periods then ended.
Except as indicated therein, all assets that are reflected on the Parent
Statutory Financial Statements comply in all material respects with all
applicable insurance Laws regulating the investments of the Parent Insurance
Subsidiaries, as applicable, and each Parent Insurance Subsidiary maintains,
as of the date of the Latest Parent Balance Sheet, admitted assets in an
amount at least equal to the minimum capital and surplus required by
applicable insurance Laws. The financial statements included in the Parent
Statutory Financial Statements accurately reflect in all material respects the
extent to which, pursuant to applicable Laws and applicable SAP, each Parent
Insurance Subsidiary is entitled to take credit for reinsurance (or any local
equivalent concept).

(f) Parent and its Subsidiaries have filed each report and definitive proxy
statement (together with all amendments thereof and supplements thereto)
required to be filed by Parent or any of its Subsidiaries pursuant to the
Exchange Act with the SEC since January 1, 2010 (as such documents have since
the time of their filing been amended or supplemented, the " _Parent SEC
Reports_ "). As of their respective dates, after giving effect to any
amendments or supplements thereto filed prior to the date hereof, the Parent
SEC Reports (i) complied as to form in all material respects with the
requirements of the Exchange Act, and (ii) did not contain any
untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact required
to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in
light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading.

 



\- 57 -  Section 5.5 _Consents and Approvals; No Violations_. Assuming the truth
and accuracy of the Companys representations and warranties contained in
_Section 4.5_, no material notices to, filings with, or authorizations,
consents or approvals of any Person or Governmental Entity are necessary for

the execution, delivery or performance by Parent or Amalgamation Sub of this
Agreement or the Ancillary Documents to which Parent and/or Amalgamation Sub
is a party nor the consummation by Parent or Amalgamation Sub of the
transactions contemplated hereby or thereby will (a) conflict with or result
in any breach of any provision of Parents or Amalgamation Subs Governing
Documents, (b) except as set forth on Schedule 5.5, result in a violation or
breach of, or cause acceleration, or constitute (with or without due notice or
lapse of time or both) a default (or give rise to any right of termination,
cancellation, modification or acceleration) under any of the terms, conditions
or provisions of any Parent Material Contract, Parent Real Property Lease or
Parent Material Permit, (c) violate any Law, writ, injunction or decree of any
Governmental Entity having jurisdiction over any of Parent or Amalgamation Sub
or any of Parents or Amalgamation Subs Subsidiaries or any of their
respective properties or assets or (d) except as contemplated by this
Agreement or with respect to Permitted Liens, result in the creation of any
Lien upon any of the assets of any of Parent, Amalgamation Sub or any of
Parents or Amalgamation Subs Subsidiaries, which in the case of any of
clauses (b), (c) and (d) above, would constitute a Parent Material Adverse
Effect.

and no Parent Group Company or, to the knowledge of Parent, any third party

Section 6.2 _No Control of the Company s Business_. Nothing contained in this
Agreement shall give Parent or Amalgamation Sub, directly or indirectly, the
right to control or direct the Companys or any of the Group Companies
operations prior to the Closing in any manner that would violate applicable
Law.

 

Section 6.3 _Tax Matters_.

(a) Parent, the Company and the Securityholders Representative shall
cooperate fully, as and to the extent reasonably requested by the other party,
in connection with the preparation, filing and execution of Tax Returns and
any audit, litigation or other proceeding with respect to Taxes. Such
cooperation shall include the retention and (upon the other partys request)
the provision of records and information that are reasonably relevant to any
such audit, litigation or other proceeding and making employees available on a
mutually convenient basis to provide additional information and explanation of
any material provided hereunder or to testify at any such proceeding.
The Securityholders Representative and Parent agree to (and, after the
Closing, Parent will cause the Group Companies to) retain all books and
records with respect to Tax matters pertinent to any Group Company for a
period of seven (7) years. The Securityholders Representative shall have the
right to consent to any settlement or compromise, or the right to control the
litigation or settlement (in accordance with the principles set forth in
_Section 9.3_ and  _Section 9.8_, assuming the Securityholders
Representative is the responsible party with respect thereto), of any matter
described above in this subsection (a) that could give rise to an
indemnification obligation out of the Escrow Account pursuant to this
Agreement, subject to _Section 9.3_ and _Section 9.8_. Parent, the Company
and the Securityholders Representative further agree, upon request, to use
their commercially reasonable efforts to obtain any certificate or other
document from any taxing authority or any other Person or take any other
action as may be necessary to mitigate, reduce or eliminate any Tax that could
be imposed on any Party (including with respect to the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement).

(b) All transfer Taxes, recording fees and other similar Taxes that are
imposed on any of the Parties by any Governmental Entity in connection with
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement shall be borne equally by
Parent and the Company. Parent will file all necessary Tax Returns and other
documentation with respect to all such transfer, documentary, sales, use,
stamp, registration and other Taxes and fees, with such filing expenses to be
borne equally by Parent and the Company.

 



\- 72 -  Section 6.4 _Access to Information_. From and after the date hereof until
the earlier of the Closing Date or the termination of this Agreement in
accordance with its terms, upon reasonable advance notice, and subject to
restrictions contained in the confidentiality agreements to which the Group
Companies are subject, the Company shall provide to Parent and its authorized
representatives reasonable access to all books and records of the Group
Companies and all officers, directors, employees and other personnel of the
Group Companies, in each case, during normal business hours (in a manner so
as to not interfere with the normal business operations of any Group Company).
From and after the date immediately following the expiration or termination of
the waiting period under the HSR Act (or any other Antitrust Law), (a) the
Company shall permit a limited number of authorized representatives of Parent
to attend any and all meetings of the Company Executive Committee (or any sub-
committee thereof) and meetings of the board of directors and any committee
thereof (or similar governing body) of each Group Company and to receive all
written materials and communications related to such meetings at the same time
as (or promptly thereafter) management or the board or committee (or
similar governing body) receives such materials or communications, provided
that the Group Companies shall be entitled to require that any
representative(s) of Parent recuse themselves from any portion of any such
meeting, and the Group Companies shall be entitled to redact or withhold any
such materials or communications, to the extent that the representative(s)
participation in the portion of such meeting, or the provision of such
materials or communications to the representative(s), would be reasonably
likely to (x) jeopardize any attorney-client or other legal privilege, (y)
contravene any applicable Laws or (z) breach any confidentiality obligations
of the Group Companies under contracts with third parties and (b) solely to
the extent permitted by applicable Law, Parent and its authorized
representatives shall be permitted to offer advice and guidance to the Group
Companies on their business operations, which the Group Companies shall
consider in their respective sole discretion, provided that, for the
avoidance of doubt, in no event shall the Group Companies be obligated to
follow or implement any such advice or guidance. All of such information shall
be treated as confidential information pursuant to the terms of the
Confidentiality Agreement, the provisions of which are by this reference
hereby incorporated herein. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this
Agreement, the Company shall not be required to disclose any information to
Parent (including pursuant to _Section 6.1_) if such disclosure would be
reasonably likely to (x) jeopardize any attorney-client or other legal
privilege, (y) contravene any applicable Laws or (z) breach
any confidentiality obligations of the Group Companies under contracts with
third parties; provided, however, that the Company shall notify Parent in
writing with a general description of each item not disclosed pursuant to this
clause.

 

Section 6.5 _Efforts to Consummate_.

(a) Subject to the terms and conditions herein provided, each of Parent,
Amalgamation Sub and the Company shall use reasonable best efforts to take, or
cause to be taken, all action and to do, or cause to be done, all things
reasonably necessary to consummate and make effective as promptly as
practicable the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (including the
satisfaction, but not waiver, of the closing conditions set forth in
_Article 7_ ). Each of Parent, Amalgamation Sub and the Company shall use
reasonable best efforts to obtain

 



\- 73 -   consents of all Governmental Entities necessary to consummate the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement. All costs incurred in connection
with obtaining such consents, including the filing fees under the HSR Act and
other Antitrust Laws, shall be borne equally by Parent and the Company. Each
Party shall make an appropriate filing, if necessary, pursuant to the HSR Act
and all other filings required by applicable Antitrust Laws with respect to
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement promptly (and in any event,
within fifteen (15) Business Days in the case of filings pursuant to the HSR
Act, and within twenty (20) Business Days in the case of all other
filings required by applicable Antitrust Laws) after the date of this
Agreement and shall supply as promptly as practicable to the appropriate
Governmental Entities any additional information and documentary material that
may be requested pursuant to the HSR Act or other Antitrust Laws. Without
limiting the foregoing, (i) Parent, Amalgamation Sub and the Company and their
respective Affiliates shall not extend any waiting period or comparable period
under the HSR Act or other Antitrust Laws or enter into any agreement with
any Governmental Entity not to consummate the transactions contemplated
hereby, except with the prior written consent of the other Parties, and (ii)
each Party shall, and shall cause its Affiliates to, take all actions that
are reasonably necessary or as may be required by any Governmental Entity to
expeditiously consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

(b) In furtherance and not in limitation of _Section 6.5(a)_, (i) as soon as
reasonably practicable following the date of this Agreement (and in any event,
within twenty (20) Business Days), the Company and Parent shall cooperate in
all respects with each other and use (and shall cause their respective
Affiliates to use) their respective reasonable best efforts to prepare and
file with the relevant insurance regulators requests for approval of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement (and amend filings, re-file and/or
make new filings, if and when necessary, as soon as reasonably practicable)
and shall use reasonable best efforts to have such insurance
regulators approve the transactions contemplated by this Agreement to the
extent approval is required under applicable Law, (ii) within a reasonable
time prior to furnishing the same to any insurance regulator, each Party shall
provide all applications with the insurance regulators to the other Parties
in advance for their approval (such approval not to be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed) and each Party shall have a reasonable opportunity to
provide comments thereon, (iii) the Company and Parent shall give the other
party prompt written notice if it receives any material notice or other
communication from any insurance regulator in connection with the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, and, in the case of any such written notice
or communication, shall promptly furnish the other party with a copy thereof,
and (iv) to the extent reasonably practicable, each Party shall provide all
substantive correspondence with the insurance regulators to the other Parties
in advance for their approval (such approval not to be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed). The Company and Parent shall have the right to
participate in and shall, to the extent reasonably practicable, receive
reasonable prior notice of, all meetings (telephonic or otherwise) of the
other party with any insurance regulators in respect of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement; provided, however, that nothing in this
_Section 6.5_ shall require either Parent or Company to provide or cause to
be provided to the other confidential information submitted to any
Governmental Entity or the portions of notices or other communications
received from or with Governmental Entities relating or referring
to confidential information.

 



\- 74 -  (c) In the event any claim, action, suit, investigation or other proceeding by
any Governmental Entity or other Person is commenced which questions the
validity or legality of the transactions contemplated hereby or seeks damages
in connection therewith, Parent, Amalgamation Sub and the Company agree to
cooperate and use reasonable best efforts to defend against such claim,
action, suit, investigation or other proceeding and, if an injunction or other
order is issued in any such action, suit or other proceeding, to use
reasonable best efforts to have such injunction or other order lifted, and to
cooperate reasonably regarding any other impediment to the consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby.

(d) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this _Section 6.5_
or any other section of this Agreement, none of Parent, Amalgamation Sub or
any of their Affiliates shall be required to, and the Company may not,
without the prior written consent of Parent, become subject to, consent to, or
offer or agree to, or otherwise take any action or refrain from taking any
action or agree or commit to any condition, limitation, restriction or
requirement of any Governmental Entity (except as set forth in _Schedule 6.5_
) that would materially adversely affect the economic benefits reasonably
expected to be derived by Parent under this Agreement or in connection
with the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereunder (a "
_Burdensome Condition_ "); provided that, in the event that a Governmental
Entity requires that the terms of this Agreement be changed or altered in a
manner that adversely affects any such benefits reasonably expected to be
derived hereunder, each of the Parties shall use its reasonable best efforts
and cooperate and negotiate in good faith to agree to alternative terms to
this Agreement that are acceptable to such Governmental Entity and provide
benefits substantially similar to the benefits provided under the original
terms thereof.

Section 6.6 _Public Announcements_. No press release or public announcement
related to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated herein, or prior to
the Closing, any other announcement or communication to the employees,
clients or suppliers of the Company, shall be issued or made by any Party
without the joint approval of Parent, on one hand, and the Securityholders
Representative, on the other, unless required by Law (in the reasonable
opinion of counsel) in which case Parent or the Securityholders
Representative, as applicable, shall have the right to review such press
release, announcement or communication prior to its issuance, distribution or
publication; provided, however, that the foregoing shall not restrict or
prohibit the Company from making any announcement to its employees,
equityholders, customers and other business relations to the extent the
Company reasonably determines in good faith that such announcement is
necessary or advisable.

Section 6.7 _Indemnification; Directors  and Officers Insurance_.

(a) Parent agrees that all rights to indemnification or exculpation now
existing in favor of the directors, officers, employees and agents of each
Group Company, as provided in such Group Companys Governing Documents or
otherwise in effect as of the date hereof with respect to any matters
occurring prior to the Closing Date, shall survive the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement and shall continue in full force and effect and
that Parent and the Group Companies on their own behalf, will perform and
discharge the Group Companies obligations to provide such indemnity
and exculpation. To the maximum extent permitted by applicable Law, such
indemnification shall be mandatory rather than permissive, and Parent shall,
and shall cause the Amalgamated Company to, advance expenses in connection
with such indemnification as provided in such Group Companys Governing
Documents or other applicable agreements. The indemnification and liability
limitation or exculpation provisions of

 



\- 75 -   the Group Companies Governing Documents shall not be amended, repealed or
otherwise modified after the Closing Date in any manner that would adversely
affect the rights thereunder of individuals who, as of the Closing Date or at
any time prior to the Closing Date, were directors, officers, employees or
agents of any Group Company, unless such modification is required by
applicable Law.

 

(b) Contemporaneously with the Closing, Parent shall, at its expense, and
shall cause the Amalgamated Company to, purchase and maintain in effect,
without any lapses in coverage, a "tail" policy providing directors and
officers liability insurance coverage for the benefit of those Persons who
are covered by any Group Companys directors and officers liability
insurance policies as of the date hereof or at the Closing, for a period of
six (6) years following the Closing Date with respect to matters occurring
prior to the Closing that is at least equal to the coverage provided under
the Group Companies current directors and officers liability insurance
policies; provided, however, that the Amalgamated Company may substitute
therefor policies of at least the same coverage containing terms and
conditions which are no less advantageous to the beneficiaries thereof so
long as such substitution does not result in gaps or lapses in coverage with
respect to matters occurring prior to the Closing Date and provided further
that in no event shall Parent be required to pay more than 250% of the
current annual premium payable by the Group Companies for such insurance.

(c) The directors, officers, employees and agents of each Group Company
entitled to the indemnification, liability limitation, exculpation and
insurance set forth in this _Section 6.7_ are intended to be third party
beneficiaries of this  _Section 6.7_. This _Section 6.7_ shall survive the
consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and shall be
binding on all successors and assigns of Parent and the Company.

 

Section 6.8 _Exclusive Dealing_. During the period from the date of this
Agreement until the earlier of the Closing Date or the termination of this
Agreement in accordance with its terms, the Company shall not take, or permit
any Group Company or any of their respective Affiliates, officers, directors,
employees, representatives, consultants, financial advisors,
attorneys, accountants or other agents to take, any action to solicit,
encourage, initiate or engage in discussions or negotiations with, or provide
any information to or enter into any agreement with any Person (other than
Parent and/or its respective Affiliates) concerning any purchase of any of
the Companys equity securities or any merger, amalgamation, sale of
substantial assets or similar transaction involving any Group Company, other
than assets sold in the ordinary course of business in accordance with
Section 6.1 (each such acquisition transaction, an " _Acquisition Transaction_
"); provided, however, that Parent hereby acknowledges that prior to the date
of this Agreement, the Company has provided information relating to the Group
Companies and has afforded access to, and engaged in discussions with, other
Persons in connection with a proposed Acquisition Transaction and that such
information, access and discussions could reasonably enable another Person to
form a basis for an Acquisition Transaction without any breach by the Company
of this Section 6.8.

Section 6.9  _Documents and Information_. After the Closing Date, Parent
shall, and shall cause the Amalgamated Company and the Group Companies, until
the seventh (7th) anniversary of the Closing Date, retain all books, records
and other documents pertaining to the business of the Group Companies in
existence on the Closing Date and make the same available

 



\- 76 -   for inspection and copying by the Securityholders Representative (at the
Securityholders Representatives expense) during normal business hours of the
Amalgamated Company or any of its Subsidiaries, as applicable, upon
reasonable request and upon reasonable notice.

Section 6.10 _Contact with Customers, Suppliers and Other Business
Relations_. During the period from the date of this Agreement until the
earlier of the Closing Date or the termination of this Agreement in accordance
with its terms, Parent hereby agrees that it is not authorized to, and shall
not (and shall not permit any of its employees, agents, representatives or
Affiliates to), contact any employee (excluding executive officers), insured,
insurance broker, reinsurance intermediary, customer, supplier,
vendor, distributor or other material business relation of any Group Company
regarding any Group Company, its business or the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement without the prior consent of the Company, which consent shall
not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed.

Section 6.11 _Employee Benefit Matters_.

 

(a) During the period beginning on the Closing Date and ending on the first
(1st) anniversary of the Closing Date, Parent shall provide, or shall cause
the Amalgamated Company to provide, employees of each Group Company who
continue to be employed by a Group Company (collectively, " _Continuing
Employees_ ") with the same salary or hourly wage rate as provided to such
Continuing Employees immediately prior to the Closing Date and with employee
benefits that are substantially similar in the aggregate to the employee
benefits provided under the Company Employee Benefit Plans in which such
Continuing Employees participated as of the date of this Agreement. Parent
further agrees that, from and after the Closing Date, Parent shall, and shall
cause each Group Company to, grant all Continuing Employees credit for any
service with such Group Company earned prior to the Closing Date (i) for
eligibility and vesting purposes, and (ii) for purposes of vacation accrual
and severance benefit determinations under any benefit or compensation plan,
program, agreement or arrangement that may be established or maintained by
Parent or any Group Company on or after the Closing Date (collectively, the "
_New Plans_ "), except as would result in duplication of benefits. In
addition, Parent shall use commercially reasonable efforts to (x) cause to be
waived all pre-existing condition exclusions and actively at work requirements
and similar limitations, eligibility waiting periods and evidence of
insurability requirements under any New Plans to the extent waived
or satisfied by a Continuing Employee under any Company Employee Benefit Plan
as of the Closing Date, and (y) cause any deductible, co-insurance and covered
out-of-pocket expenses paid during the calendar year of the Closing and on or
before the Closing Date by any employee (or covered dependent thereof) of any
Group Company to be taken into account for purposes of satisfying the
corresponding deductible, coinsurance and maximum out of pocket provisions
after the Closing Date under any applicable New Plan in the year of initial
participation.

(b) Parent agrees that Parent, through a Parent Group Company or a Group
Company group health plan (as defined in Section 4980B of the Code), shall be
responsible for satisfying the continuation coverage requirements of Section
4980B of the Code for all individuals who are "MandA qualified beneficiaries"
as such term is defined in Treasury Regulation Section 54.4980B-9.

 



\- 77 -  (c) Nothing contained in this _Section 6.11_, express or implied, is intended
to confer upon any employee of any Group Company any right to continued
employment for any period or continued receipt of any specific employee
benefit, or shall constitute an amendment to or any other modification of any
New Plan or Company Employee Benefit Plan. Further, this _Section 6.11_
shall be binding upon and inure solely to the benefit of each of the Parties
to this Agreement, and nothing in this _Section 6.11_, express or implied, is
intended to confer upon any other Person any rights or remedies of any nature
whatsoever under or by reason of this _Section 6.11_.

 

Section 6.12 _Schedule Supplements_. From time to time commencing on the date

to Parent written notice of any event or development that would render any
representation or warranty of the Company in this Agreement (including the
Company Schedules) inaccurate or incomplete due to the events
or circumstances occurring after the date hereof and (ii) Parent shall
deliver to the Company written notice of any event or development that would
render any representation or warranty of Parent in this Agreement (including
the Parent Schedules) inaccurate or incomplete due to the events or
circumstances occurring after the date hereof (each of (i) or (ii), a "
_Schedule Supplement_ "); provided, however, that no such Schedule Supplement
shall (a) affect Parents right to terminate this Agreement in accordance
with _Section 8.1(b)_ or the Companys right to terminate this Agreement in
accordance with _Section 8.1(c)_, (b) be given effect for purposes of
determining whether the condition set forth in _Section 7.2(a)_ or _Section
7.3(a)_ has been satisfied, or (c) the Parties indemnification rights under
_Article 9_.

any material respect its obligations under this Agreement (and, in the case

constitute a waiver of such rights, nor shall any single or partial exercise

(which claims shall survive until final resolution thereof). No Parent
Indemnitee shall be entitled to be indemnified from, defended or held
harmless against any Loss pursuant to the terms of this _Section 9.2_ unless

11.2_ on or prior to the applicable survival date set forth in _Section 9.1_.
No Securityholder Indemnitee shall be entitled to be indemnified from,

of its claim for indemnification to Parent pursuant to _Section 11.2_ on or
prior to the applicable survival date set forth in  _Section 9.1_.

Section 9.3 _Indemnification Procedures_.

 

(a) In order for a party (the " _Indemnified Party_ ") to be entitled to any
indemnification provided for under this Agreement in respect of, arising out
of or involving a claim or demand made by, or an action, proceeding or
investigation instituted by, any Person not a party to this Agreement (a "
_Third Party Claim_ "), such Indemnified Party must notify the other party
(the " _Indemnifying Party_ ") in writing, and in reasonable detail, of the
Third Party Claim promptly, and in any event within ten (10) Business Days,
after such Indemnified Party learns of the Third Party Claim; provided,
however, that any delay or failure to give such notification shall not affect
the indemnification provided hereunder except and only to the extent that the
Indemnifying Party is prejudiced as a result of such failure. Thereafter, the
Indemnified Party shall deliver to the Indemnifying Party, promptly and in any
event within ten (10) days after the Indemnified Partys receipt thereof,
copies of all notices and documents (including court papers) received by
the Indemnified Party relating to the Third Party Claim.

(b) If a Third Party Claim is made against an Indemnified Party,
the Indemnifying Party will be entitled to participate in the defense thereof
and, if it so chooses, to assume the defense thereof at its own expense with
counsel selected by the Indemnifying Party (not reasonably objected to by the
Indemnified Party). Any such assumption of the defense

 



\- 86 -   thereof shall not be deemed an admission by the Indemnifying Party that the
Third Party Claim is within the scope of the Indemnifying Partys
indemnification obligations under this Agreement. Should the Indemnifying
Party so elect to assume the defense of a Third Party Claim, the Indemnifying
Party will not as long as it conducts such defense be liable to the
Indemnified Party for legal expenses subsequently incurred by the Indemnified
Party in connection with the defense thereof, except as otherwise set forth
herein. If the Indemnifying Party assumes such defense, the Indemnified Party
shall have the right to participate in the defense thereof and to employ
counsel (not reasonably objected to by the Indemnifying Party), at its own
expense, separate from the counsel employed by the Indemnifying Party, it
being understood that the Indemnifying Party shall control such defense;
provided, however, that if in the reasonable opinion of counsel to the
Indemnified Party, (i) there are legal defenses available to an Indemnified
Party that are different from or additional to those available to the
Indemnifying Party or (ii) there exists a conflict of interest between the
Indemnifying Party and the Indemnified Party, the Indemnifying Party shall be
liable for the reasonable fees and expenses of one law firm to represent the
Indemnified Party and, if applicable, local counsel in the jurisdiction in
which an action is held. The Indemnifying Party shall be liable for the fees
and expenses of counsel employed by the Indemnified Party for any period
during which the Indemnifying Party has not assumed the defense thereof.

 

(c) Whether or not the Indemnifying Party shall have assumed the defense of a
Third Party Claim, the Indemnified Party shall not admit any liability with
respect to, or settle, compromise or discharge, such Third Party Claim without
the Indemnifying Partys prior written consent, which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld. The Indemnifying Party shall not settle, compromise,
consent to the entry of any judgment in or otherwise seek to terminate any
action giving rise to a Third Party Claim unless the Indemnifying Party
obtains the prior written consent of the Indemnified Party, which consent
shall not be unreasonably withheld.

(d) All of the Parties shall reasonably cooperate in the defense or
prosecution of any Third Party Claim in respect of which indemnity may be
sought hereunder and each of Parent and the Securityholders Representative
(or a duly authorized representative of such Party) shall (and shall cause the
Group Companies to) furnish such records, information and testimony, and
attend such conferences, discovery proceedings, hearings, trials and appeals,
as may be reasonably requested in connection therewith.

Section 9.4 _Limitations on Indemnification_.

(a) The rights of the Parent Indemnitees to indemnification pursuant to the
provisions of _Section 9.2(a)_ are subject to the following limitations:

(i) except for Losses arising from any breach or inaccuracy of any Company
Fundamental Representation or the representations or warranties in _Section
4.2_ (which shall not be subject to the following limitation), the Parent
Indemnitees shall not be entitled to recover Losses pursuant to _Section
9.2(a)(i)_ until the total amount of Losses which the Parent Indemnitees would
recover under _Section 9.2(a)(i)_, but for this _Section 9.4(a)_, exceeds
$7,000,000, in which case, the Parent Indemnitees shall only be entitled to
recover Losses in excess of such amount;

 



\- 87 -  (ii) except for Losses arising from any breach or inaccuracy of any
Company Fundamental Representation or the representations or warranties in
_Section 4.2_ (which shall not be subject to the following limitation), the
Parent Indemnitees shall not be entitled to recover for any particular Loss
(including any series of related Losses) pursuant to _Section 9.2(a)(i)_
unless such Loss (including any series of related Losses) equals or exceeds
$100,000; and

(iii) the maximum Losses indemnifiable pursuant to _Section 9.2(a)_ and
_Section 9.2(b)_ shall be the Escrow Amount, and the Escrow Amount shall be
the sole and exclusive source of recovery with respect to such Losses.

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, the limitations
contained in  _Section 9.4(a)(i)_ and _Section 9.4(a)(ii)_ above shall not
apply to any claims made pursuant to _Section 9.2(b)_. Any claim reasonably
identified by a Parent Indemnitee or a Group Company as a claim made pursuant
to  _Section 9.2(b)_ shall not be treated as a claim made pursuant to
_Section 9.2(a)_.

(b) The rights of the Securityholder Indemnitees to indemnification pursuant
to the provisions of _Section 9.2(c)_ are subject to the following
limitations:

(i) except for Losses arising from any breach or inaccuracy of any Parent
Fundamental Representation (which shall not be subject to the following
limitation), the Securityholder Indemnitees shall not be entitled to recover
Losses pursuant to _Section 9.2(c)(i)_ until the total amount of Losses which
the Securityholder Indemnitees would recover under _Section 9.2(c)(i)_, but
for this _Section 9.4(b)_, exceeds $7,000,000, in which case, the
Securityholder Indemnitees shall only be entitled to recover Losses in excess
of such amount;

(ii) except for Losses arising from any breach or inaccuracy of any Parent
Fundamental Representation (which shall not be subject to the following
limitation), the Securityholder Indemnitees shall not be entitled to recover
for any particular Loss (including any series of related Losses) pursuant to
_Section 9.2(c)(i)_ unless such Loss (including any series of related Losses)
equals or exceeds $100,000; and

 

(iii) the maximum Losses indemnifiable pursuant to _Section 9.2(c)_ shall be
$46,000,000.

 

(c) The rights of the Parent Indemnitees or the Securityholder Indemnitees to
indemnification pursuant to the provisions of  _Section 9.2_ are subject to
the following limitations:

(i) the amount of any and all Losses shall be determined net of any amounts
actually received by the Parent Indemnitees or Securityholder Indemnitees, as
applicable, under insurance policies or from other collateral sources (such as
contractual indemnities of any Person which are contained outside of this
Agreement) with respect to such Losses;

(ii) neither the Parent Indemnitees nor the Securityholder Indemnitees,
respectively, shall be entitled to indemnification pursuant to _Section
9.2(a)_ or _Section 9.2(c)_, respectively, for any Loss to the extent that
prior to the date hereof the Group Companies or the Parent Group Companies,
respectively, recorded a reserve in their consolidated books and records with
respect to such Loss; and

 



\- 88 -  (iii) neither the Parent Indemnitees nor the Securityholder Indemnitees shall
be entitled to recover or make a claim for any amounts in respect of any
consequential damages (including loss of revenue, income or profits, loss or
diminution in value of assets or securities or punitive damages and, in
particular, consequential damages calculated by "multiple of profits" or
"multiple of cash flow" or other valuation methodology, and in no case shall
any such valuation methodology be used in calculating the amount of any
Losses) or punitive, special or exemplary damages.

Notwithstanding anything contained herein to the contrary, on the date that
the Escrow Amount is reduced to zero (0), the Parent Indemnitees shall have
no further rights to indemnification under _Section 9.2(a)_ and _Section
9.2(b)_. Notwithstanding anything contained herein to the contrary, on the
date that the aggregate amount paid to all Securityholder Indemnitees
pursuant to this _Article 9_ equals the Escrow Amount, the Securityholder
Indemnitees shall have no further rights to indemnification under _Section
9.2(c)_. The Parent Indemnitees and the Securityholder Indemnitees shall use
their commercially reasonable efforts to collect any amounts available under
any insurance coverage or from any collateral source as referred to in
_Section 9.4(c)(i)_. In any case where a Parent Indemnitee recovers, under
insurance policies or from other collateral sources, any amount in respect of
a matter for which such Parent Indemnitee was indemnified pursuant to _Section
9.2(a)_ or _Section 9.2(b)_, such Parent Indemnitee shall promptly pay over
to the Escrow Agent for re-inclusion in the Escrow Amount the amount so
recovered (after deducting therefrom the amount of the expenses incurred by
such Parent Indemnitee in procuring such recovery), but not in excess of the
_sum_ of (i) any amount previously so paid out of the Escrow Amount to or on
behalf of such Parent Indemnitee in respect of such matter and (ii) any amount
expended by the Securityholders Representative or any Securityholder
Indemnitee in pursuing or defending any claim arising out of such matter.

Section 9.5 _Treatment of Indemnity Payments_. All payments made out of the
Escrow Amount to or for the benefit of Parent Indemnitees pursuant to this
Article 9 shall be treated as adjustments to the Company Equity Consideration
for Tax purposes, unless otherwise required by Law, and such agreed treatment
shall govern for purposes of this Agreement.

Section 9.6 _Exclusive Remedy_. Except in the case where a Party seeks to
obtain specific performance and/or other equitable relief pursuant to _Section
11.15_, from and after the Closing the rights of the parties to
indemnification pursuant to the provisions of this Article 9 shall be the
sole and exclusive remedy for such parties with respect to any matter in any
way arising from or relating to (i) this Agreement or its subject matter or
(ii) any other matter relating to any of the Group Companies or Parent Group
Companies prior to the Closing, the operation of their respective businesses
prior to the Closing, or any other transaction or state of facts involving any
of the Group Companies or Parent Group Companies prior to the Closing
(including any common law or statutory rights or remedies for environmental,
health, or safety matters), in each case regardless of the legal theory under
which such liability or obligation may be sought to be imposed, whether
sounding in contract or tort, or whether at law or in equity, or otherwise,
and that the Parent Indemnitees and Securityholder Indemnitees shall have no
other remedy or recourse with respect to any of the foregoing other than
pursuant to, and subject to the 

 



\- 89 -   terms and conditions of, _Section 9.2_. Parent acknowledges and agrees that
the Parent Indemnitees, and the Securityholders Representative acknowledges
and agrees that the Securityholder Indemnitees, may not avoid such limitation
on liability by (x) seeking damages for breach of contract, tort or pursuant
to any other theory of liability, all of which are hereby waived or (y)
asserting or threatening any claim against any Person that is not a party
hereto (or a successor to a party hereto) for breaches of the representations,
warranties and covenants contained in this Agreement. The Parties agree that
the provisions in this Agreement relating to indemnification (including this
_Article 9_ ), and the limits imposed on Parents, the Parent Indemnitees and
the Securityholder Indemnitees remedies with respect to this Agreement and
the transactions contemplated hereby (including _Section 9.1_ and _Section
9.2_) were specifically bargained for between sophisticated parties and were
specifically taken into account in the determination of the amounts to be paid
to the Company Equity Securityholders hereunder. Subject to the foregoing and
_Section 11.15_, to the maximum extent permitted by Law, the parties hereby
waive all other rights and remedies with respect to any matter in any way
relating to this Agreement or arising in connection herewith, whether under
any Laws at common law, in equity or otherwise (including with respect to any
environmental, health or safety matters, including those arising under any
Environmental Laws).

 

Section 9.7 _Manner of Payment; Escrow Release_.

(a) Any amounts owing to the Parent Indemnitees pursuant to this _Article 9_
shall be made solely by disbursement of a portion of the Escrow Amount in
accordance with the terms of the Escrow Agreement. In no event shall the
Parent Indemnitees be entitled to recover an aggregate amount pursuant to this
_Article 9_ in excess of the available portion of the Escrow Amount at any
given time.

 

(b) Any portion of the Escrow Amount released by the Escrow Agent for payment
to the Company Equity Securityholders shall be released in accordance with
and subject to the terms of the Escrow Agreement.

(c) Parent and the Securityholders Representative shall deliver joint written
instructions to the Escrow Agent as necessary to make any distribution from
the Escrow Account as necessary to effectuate the release of the Escrow Amount
as contemplated by and in accordance with the Escrow Agreement. 

Section 9.8 _Tax Contests_.

(a) After the Closing, Parent Indemnitee or Group Company shall promptly
notify the Securityholders Representative in writing of the commencement of
any Tax audit or administrative or judicial proceeding or of any demand or
claim on Parent or Group Company which, if determined adversely to the
taxpayer, would be grounds for indemnification under this _Article 9_ (a "
_Tax Contest_ "); _provided_ , that any delay or failure to give such prompt
notification shall not affect Parent Indemnitee or Group Companys right to
indemnification pursuant to _Section 9.1(b)_ with respect to such Tax
Contest. Such notice shall contain factual information (to the extent known
to Parent Indemnitee or Group Company) describing the asserted Tax liability
in reasonable detail and shall include copies of any notice or other document
received from any taxing authority in respect of any such asserted
Tax liability.

 



\- 90 -  (b) In the case of a Tax Contest that relates to (i) a taxable period ending
on or before, or that includes, December 31, 2012, or (ii) any matter which
could increase any Parent Indemnitees right to be indemnified for Taxes
(including pursuant to _Section 9.2(b)_ of this Agreement),
the Securityholders Representative shall have the right to control such Tax
Contest; _provided_ , _however_ , that (i) such right to control such Tax
Contest shall revert to the Parent Indemnitee if the reasonably expected cost
of any settlement or other resolution of such Tax Contest would exceed the
available portion of the Escrow Amount, provided that in such case the Parent
shall not settle or otherwise resolve such Tax contest without the prior
express written consent of the Securityholders Representative (which consent
shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed), and (ii)
regardless of such right to control such Tax Contest, no settlement or other
resolution of such Tax Contest shall be agreed by the Securityholders
Representative without the prior express written consent of the Parent
Indemnitee (which consent should not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or
delayed) if such settlement or other resolution would reasonably be expected
to materially adversely affect any Parent Indemnitees or a Group Companys
future tax position.

 

ARTICLE X

 

SECURITYHOLDERS REPRESENTATIVE

Section 10.1 _Appointment of the Securityholders  Representative_.

 

(a) By virtue of the adoption of this Agreement and the approval of the
Amalgamation by the Company Shareholders, each Company Equity Securityholder
(regardless of whether or not such Company Equity Securityholder votes in
favor of the adoption of this Agreement and the approval of the Amalgamation,
whether at a meeting or by written consent in lieu thereof) hereby
initially appoints, as of the date of this Agreement, the Securityholders
Representative, as his, her or its true and lawful agent and attorney-in-fact
to act on behalf of each Company Equity Securityholder, and authorizes the
Securityholders Representative to take any and all actions specified in or
contemplated by this Agreement, the Escrow Agreement or the Paying Agency
Agreement and take all actions necessary or appropriate in the reasonable
judgment of the Securityholders Representative for the accomplishment of the
foregoing. Subject to the terms of this _Article 10_ , the Securityholders
Representative shall take any and all actions that it reasonably believes are
necessary or appropriate under this Agreement, the Escrow Agreement or the
Paying Agency Agreement for and on behalf of the Company Equity
Securityholders, as fully as such Company Equity Securityholders were acting
on their own behalf, including in connection with the determination of the
Final Excess Large Losses pursuant to _Section 3.14_ and the investigation,
defense and/or settlement of any claims for which any Parent Indemnitee seeks
indemnification pursuant to _Article 9_.

 

(b) All decisions made and actions taken by the Securityholders
Representative under this Agreement, the Escrow Agreement or the Paying
Agency Agreement, including any agreement between the Securityholders
Representative and any Parent Indemnitee relating to determination of the
Final Excess Large Losses pursuant to _Section 3.14_ or the defense or
settlement of any claims for which any Parent Indemnitee seeks
indemnification pursuant to _Article 9_ , shall be binding upon all of the
Company Equity Securityholders and their successors as if expressly confirmed
and ratified in writing by each of them, and no Company Equity Securityholder
shall have the right to object, dissent, protest or otherwise contest the

 



\- 91 -   same. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Securityholders Representative
will not consent to the entry of any judgment or enter into any settlement
that (i) imposes any material non-monetary obligation on (A) all or
substantially all of the Company Equity Securityholders except with the
written consent of a majority in interest of the Company Equity
Securityholders (based on the number of Company Common Shares on a Fully
Diluted Basis held by them), _provided_ that any judgment or settlement that
imposes injunctive or other equitable relief on any of the Company Equity
Securityholders shall require the consent of the Company Equity
Securityholders holding at least ninety percent (90%) of the Company Equity
Shares (based on the number of Company Common Shares on a Fully Diluted Basis
held by them), or (B) any specific Company Equity Securityholder or group of
related Company Equity Securityholders except with the written consent of
such Company Equity Securityholder or Company Equity Securityholders;
provided, however, that in the case of either clauses (A) or (B) above,
neither the Securityholders Representative, Parent nor the Amalgamated
Company shall be responsible for any loss of rights under this Agreement or
other losses that result from the failure by the Securityholders
Representative to consent to the entry of any such judgment or enter into any
such settlement or (ii) adversely affects in any material respect a particular
Company Equity Securityholder on a discriminatory basis as compared to the
treatment afforded to all other Company Equity Securityholders without such
Company Equity Securityholders consent.

(c) The Securityholders Representative shall not have any liability to any
of the Parties hereto or to the Company Equity Securityholders for any act
done or omitted hereunder or otherwise in connection with the performance of
its duties hereunder as the Securityholders Representative while acting in
good faith and in the exercise of reasonable judgment. The Securityholders
Representative shall be entitled to rely on the advice of counsel, public
accountants or other independent experts that it reasonably determines to be
experienced in the matter at issue, and will not be liable to any of the
Parties hereto or to the Company Equity Securityholders for any action taken
or omitted to be taken in good faith based on such advice. The Company Equity
Securityholders shall severally and not jointly, and pro rata in proportion
to the number of Company Common Shares on a Fully Diluted Basis held by them,
indemnify the Securityholders Representative and hold him, her or it harmless
against any loss, liability or expense incurred without gross negligence or
bad faith on the part of the Securityholders Representative and arising out
of or in connection with the acceptance or administration of its duties
hereunder, including any out of pocket costs and expenses and legal fees and
other legal costs incurred by the Securityholders Representative; provided
that any finding of gross negligence or bad faith shall only be effective if
determined in a final and non-appealable judgment of a court of
competent jurisdiction. The Securityholders Representative may receive
reimbursement directly from the Company Equity Securityholders for such
losses, liabilities or expenses; provided, that the Securityholders
Representative Fund deposited by Parent pursuant to _Section 3.13_ shall be
used in full by the Securityholders Representative before the
Securityholders Representative requests any such reimbursement.

 

(d) The Securityholders Representative shall have full power and authority on
behalf of the Securityholder Indemnitees to execute and deliver the Escrow
Agreement and the Paying Agency Agreement and to take any and all actions on
behalf of, receive and give all notices on behalf of, execute and deliver any
and all instruments on behalf of, and execute and deliver or waive any and
all rights of, the Securityholder Indemnitees under this Agreement, the Escrow
Agreement and the Paying Agency Agreement. Without limiting the generality or
effect

 



\- 92 -   of this _Section 10.1(d)_, any claims or disputes between or among any
Parent Indemnitee, the Securityholders Representative and/or any one or more
Company Equity Securityholders relating to this Agreement or the transactions
contemplated hereby or thereby shall in the case of any claim or dispute
asserted by or against or involving any such Company Equity Securityholder
(other than any claim against or disputed with the Securityholders
Representative), be asserted or otherwise addressed solely by the
Securityholders Representative on behalf of such Company Equity
Securityholder (and not by such Company Equity Securityholder acting on its
own behalf). 

(e) By his, her or its adoption or approval of the Amalgamation, this
Agreement, the Escrow Agreement and the Paying Agency Agreement, as the case
may be, each Company Equity Securityholder agrees, in addition to the
foregoing, that:

 

(i) Any Person, including Parent, Amalgamation Sub, the Amalgamated Company
and the Escrow Agent, shall be entitled to rely conclusively on the
instructions and decisions of the Securityholders Representative as to (x)
the determination of, or settlement of any dispute with respect to, the Final
Excess Large Losses pursuant to _Section 3.14_, (y) the settlement of any
claims for indemnification by such Person pursuant to _Article 9_ , or (z) any
other actions required or permitted to be taken by the Securityholders
Representative hereunder or under the Escrow Agreement or the Paying Agency
Agreement, and no Company Equity Securityholder shall have any cause of action
against such Person for any action taken by such Person in reliance upon the
instructions or decisions of the Securityholders Representative;

(ii) all actions, decisions and instructions of the Securityholders
Representative shall be conclusive and binding upon all of the Company Equity
Securityholders and no Company Equity Securityholder shall have any cause of
action against the Securityholders Representative for any action taken,
decision made or instruction given by the Securityholders Representative
under this Agreement, the Escrow Agreement or the Paying Agency Agreement,
except for fraud or willful misconduct by the Securityholders Representative
in connection with the matters described in this  _Section 10.1_; and

(iii) the provisions of this _Section 10.1_ are independent and severable,
are irrevocable and coupled with an interest and shall be enforceable
notwithstanding any rights or remedies that any Person may have in connection
with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

 

(iv) The Person serving as the Securityholders Representative may resign upon
not less than ten (10) days prior notice to Parent, the Escrow Agent and
each Company Equity Securityholder. If the then acting Securityholders
Representative shall give notice of intent to resign, the holders of a
majority in interest of the Company Equity Securityholders (based on the
number of Company Common Shares on a Fully Diluted Basis held by them) shall,
by written notice to Parent and the Escrow Agent, appoint a successor
Securityholders Representative as soon as practicable, and in no event later
than thirty (30) days following such notice of intent to resign. In addition,
the Person then serving as the Securityholders Representative may be replaced
from time to time by 

 



\- 93 -   the holders of a majority in interest of the Company Equity Securityholders
(based on the number of Company Common Shares on a Fully Diluted Basis held by
them) upon not less than ten (10) days prior written notice to Parent, the
Escrow Agent and each Company Equity Securityholder. Each successor
Securityholders Representative shall have all of the power, authority, rights
and privileges conferred by this Agreement upon the original Securityholders
Representative, and the term " _Securityholders  Representative_" as used
herein shall be deemed to include any such successor Securityholders
Representatives.

DESIGNATION IS INTENDED TO BE IRREVOCABLE UNDER THE LAWS OF THE STATE OF NEW

Section 11.15  _Remedies_. Except as otherwise expressly provided herein, any
and all remedies provided herein will be deemed cumulative with and not
exclusive of any other remedy conferred hereby, or by Law or equity upon any
Party, and the exercise by a Party of any one remedy will not preclude the
exercise of any other remedy. The Parties agree that irreparable damage for
which monetary damages, even if available, would not be an adequate remedy,
would occur in the event that the Parties do not perform their respective
obligations under the provisions of this Agreement (including failing take
such actions as are required of them hereunder to consummate the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement) in accordance with their specific terms or
otherwise breach such provisions. It is accordingly agreed that prior to the
valid termination of this Agreement pursuant to _Section 8.1_, on the
understanding that termination pursuant to _Section 8.1(d)_ shall not be
deemed "valid" for purposes of this _Section 11.15_ if the failure of the
Closing to occur prior to the date set forth in _Section 8.1(d)_ is solely
the

 



\- 99 -   result of the failure by the Party seeking termination to perform its
obligations under this Agreement, the Parties shall be entitled to an
injunction or injunctions, specific performance and other equitable relief to
prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and
provisions of this Agreement (including Parents and Amalgamation Subs
obligation to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement if
it is required to do so hereunder), in each case without posting a bond or
undertaking, this being in addition to any other remedy to which they are
entitled at Law or in equity. Each of the Parties agrees that it will not
oppose the granting of an injunction, specific performance and other
equitable relief when expressly available pursuant to the terms of this
Agreement on the basis that the other Parties have an adequate remedy at Law
or an award of specific performance is not an appropriate remedy for any
reason at Law or equity.

Section 11.16 _Waiver of Conflicts_. Recognizing that Willkie Farr and
Gallagher LLP has acted as legal counsel to certain of the Company
Securityholders (including First Reserve and its Affiliates) and the Company,
its Affiliates and the Group Companies prior to the Closing, and that
Willkie Farr and Gallagher LLP intends to act as legal counsel to certain of
the Company Securityholders (including First Reserve and its Affiliates) after
the Closing, each of Parent and the Amalgamated Company (including on behalf
of the Group Companies) hereby waives, on its own behalf and agrees to cause
its Affiliates to waive, any conflicts that may arise in connection with
Willkie Farr and Gallagher LLP representing any of the Company Securityholders
(including First Reserve and/or its Affiliates) after the Closing as such
representation may relate to the transactions contemplated herein. In
addition, all communications involving attorney-client confidences between any
Company Securityholders (including First Reserve and its Affiliates) in the
course of the negotiation, documentation and consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby shall be deemed to be attorney-client confidences that
belong solely to such Company Securityholders and their Affiliates (and not
the Group Companies). Accordingly, the Group Companies shall not have access
to any such communications, or to the files of Willkie Farr and Gallagher LLP
relating to its engagement with respect to the transactions
contemplated herein, whether or not the Closing shall have occurred. Without
limiting the generality of the foregoing, upon and after the Closing, (i) the
applicable Company Securityholders and their Affiliates (and not the Group
Companies) shall be the sole holders of the attorney-client privilege with
respect to such engagement, and none of the Group Companies shall be a holder
thereof, (ii) to the extent that files of Willkie Farr and Gallagher LLP in
respect of such engagement constitute property of the client, only the
applicable Company Securityholders and their Affiliates (and not the Group
Companies) shall hold such property rights and (iii) Willkie Farr and Gallagher
LLP shall have no duty whatsoever to reveal or disclose any such attorney-
client communications or files to any of the Group Companies by reason of any
attorney-client relationship between Willkie Farr and Gallagher LLP and any of
the Group Companies or otherwise.

 

Section 11.17 _USD Equivalent_. To the extent computation of any amounts
contemplated by this Agreement (including the Company Equity Consideration
and any of the thresholds or other amounts contemplated by _Article 9_ )
include a currency other than U.S. dollars, such amounts shall be converted to
U.S. dollars using the USD Equivalent.

 

Section 11.18 _Time of Essence_. With regard to all dates and time periods set
forth or referred to in this Agreement, time is of the essence.
