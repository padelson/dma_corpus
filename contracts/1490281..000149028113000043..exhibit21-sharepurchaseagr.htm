Section 2.1 Purchase and Sale. Upon the terms and subject to the conditions of

($260,000,000) (the "Purchase Price"). The Purchase Price shall be paid as

price of such shares on the primary National Securities Exchange on which the
shares of Parent Common Stock are then listed for trading during the ten (10)
trading day period ending on the day immediately prior to the Closing Date
(the "Parent Shares"); provided that Buyer may, in its sole discretion, choose
to pay all or any portion of such amount due under this Section 2.2(a)(ii) in
cash in lieu of Parent Shares; provided further that Buyer must make such
election by providing written notice to Seller (x) at least three (3) Business
Days before the Closing Date 

if the Closing occurs on January 2, 2014 and (y) as soon as practicable if the
Closing occurs after January 2, 2014; and

(iii) the Escrow Amount shall be deposited in the Escrow Fund pursuant to the
terms of Section 7.5.

(b) Closing Cash Payment. At the Closing, Buyer shall pay the Closing Cash
Payment to LivingSocial (as instructed by Seller) by wire transfer of
immediately available funds to an account or accounts designated in writing by

(c) Parent Shares Payment. The Parent Shares will be issued in book entry to

(i) Estimated Working Capital. At least two (2) Business Days prior to
Closing, Seller shall prepare and deliver, or cause to be prepared and
delivered, to Buyer a consolidated balance sheet of LS Korea and its
Subsidiaries as of the Closing Date (the "Estimated Closing Balance Sheet")
containing Seller's good faith best estimate of the Working Capital as of the
Closing Date (the "Estimated Working Capital"). The Estimated Closing Balance
Sheet shall be prepared in accordance with US GAAP and the accounting
principles, practices and methodologies set forth on Schedule A (the
"Applicable Accounting Principles"). If the Estimated Working Capital is less
than the Working Capital Target, then the Purchase Price to be paid pursuant
to Section 2.2(a) will be decreased dollar for dollar by the amount of such
shortfall. If the Estimated Working Capital is greater than or equal to the
Working Capital Target, then no adjustment shall be made to the Purchase
Price.

(ii) Actual Working Capital. As soon as practicable after the Closing Date,
but not later than ninety (90) days after the Closing Date, Buyer shall
prepare and deliver to Seller (A) a consolidated balance sheet of LS Korea and
its Subsidiaries as of the Closing Date (the "Final Closing Balance Sheet"),
prepared in accordance with US GAAP and the Applicable Accounting Principles,
and reflecting all adjustments made by Buyer to the Estimated Closing Balance
Sheet, (B) Buyer's calculation of the Working Capital as of the Closing Date
(the "Actual Working Capital"), and (C) all work papers and copies of source
documents (including bank statements) that reasonably support and document
Buyer's determination of the Final Closing Balance Sheet and the Actual
Working Capital (collectively, the "Supporting Documents"). Seller shall

the Final Closing Balance Sheet.

(iii) Estimated Cash. At least two (2) Business Days prior to Closing, Seller
shall prepare and deliver, or cause to be prepared and delivered, to Buyer the
Estimated Closing Balance Sheet containing Seller's good faith best estimate
of the 

total Cash on Hand of LS Korea and its Subsidiaries as of the Closing Date
(the "Estimated Closing Cash"). The Estimated Closing Balance Sheet shall be
prepared in accordance with US GAAP and the Applicable Accounting Principles.
If the Estimated Closing Cash is less than Eleven Billion Ninety‑One Million
Three Hundred Ninety‑Three Thousand Seventy‑Nine South Korean Won (KRW
11,091,393,079) (the "Target Cash"), then the Purchase Price to be paid
pursuant to Section 2.2(a) will be decreased dollar for dollar by the amount
of such shortfall. If the Estimated Closing Cash is greater than or equal to
the Target Cash but less than Fifteen Billion Three Hundred Fifty-Three
Million Six Hundred Seventy Thousand Eight South Korean Won (KRW
15,353,670,008) (the "Cash Maximum"), then no adjustment shall be made. If (A)
the Estimated Closing Cash is greater than the Cash Maximum and (B) the
Estimated Working Capital is in excess of the Working Capital Target, then
Buyer shall increase the Purchase Price payable in cash by the amount that the
Estimated Closing Cash is in excess of the Cash Maximum; provided that the
payment of such amount to Seller will not cause the Estimated Working Capital
to be less than the Working Capital Target; and provided further that Seller
first uses or causes to be used any such excess to repay any loan amounts
outstanding between the Company and LivingSocial.

(iv) Actual Cash. As soon as practicable after the Closing Date, but not later
than ninety (90) days after the Closing Date, Buyer shall prepare and deliver
to Seller (A) the Final Closing Balance Sheet, prepared in accordance with US
GAAP and the Applicable Accounting Principles, and reflecting all adjustments
made by Buyer to the Estimated Closing Balance Sheet, (B) Buyer's calculation
of the total Cash On Hand of LS Korea and its Subsidiaries as of the Closing
Date (the "Actual Closing Cash"), and (C) all Supporting Documents (including
bank statements) underlying the determination of the Final Closing Balance
Sheet and the Actual Closing Cash.

(v) Objection Notice. Within forty‑five (45) days after the delivery of the
Final Closing Balance Sheet and Supporting Documents to Seller, Seller may
deliver written notice (the "Protest Notice") to Buyer of any objections to
the Final Closing Balance Sheet or Buyer's calculation of the Actual Working
Capital and/or the Actual Closing Cash, as applicable. Buyer shall cooperate
in good faith with Seller in its review of the Final Closing Balance Sheet.
The Protest Notice shall (A) describe the nature of Seller's objections in
reasonable detail, (B) identify the specific items involved and the dollar
amount of each such objection (if ascertainable), and (C) be accompanied with
reasonable supporting documentation for each of Seller's objections. If Seller
fails to deliver a Protest Notice within such forty‑five (45) day period, then
Seller will be deemed to have accepted the Final Closing Balance Sheet and
Buyer's calculation of the Actual Working Capital and the Actual Closing Cash
set forth therein.

(vi) Dispute Resolution. If Seller timely delivers a Protest Notice to Buyer,
then any dispute shall be resolved as follows: 

(A) Buyer and Seller shall promptly endeavor to negotiate in good faith to
agree upon the amount of the Actual Working Capital and/or and the Actual
Closing Cash, as applicable. If a written agreement determining the amount of
the Actual Working Capital and/or and the Actual Closing Cash, as applicable,
has not been reached within twenty (20) Business Days after the date of
Buyer's receipt of the Protest Notice, then the dispute over the calculation
of the Actual Working Capital and/or and the Actual Closing Cash, as
applicable shall be referred to Deloitte and Touche, LLP ("Working Capital
Arbiter").

(B) The Working Capital Arbiter shall be directed to render a detailed written
report based solely on the provisions of this Section 2.2(d) and the written
presentations by Buyer and Seller, and not by independent review, only those
items and amounts that remain then in dispute as set forth in the Protest
Notice. The Working Capital Arbiter shall establish the procedures it shall
follow (including procedures regarding the presentation of materials
supporting each Party's position) giving due regard to the mutual intention of
Buyer and Seller to resolve each of the disputed items and amounts as
accurately, quickly, efficiently and inexpensively as possible, but the
Working Capital Arbiter's determination of the Actual Working Capital and
Actual Closing Cash, as applicable, shall be made within sixty (60) days after
the dispute is submitted for its determination and shall be set forth in a
written statement delivered to Seller and Buyer. A judgment of a court of
competent jurisdiction selected pursuant to Section 9.5 hereof may be entered
upon the Working Capital Arbiter's determination. The Working Capital Arbiter
shall have exclusive jurisdiction over, and resorting to the Working Capital
Arbiter as provided in this Section 2.2(d) shall be the only recourse and
remedy of the parties against one another with respect to, those items and
amounts that remain in dispute under this Section 2.2(d) and Buyer shall not
be entitled to seek indemnification or recovery of any attorneys' fees or
other professional fees incurred by Buyer in connection with any dispute
governed by this Section 2.2(d). The Working Capital Arbiter shall allocate
its fees and expenses between Buyer and Seller according to the degree to
which the positions of the respective parties are not accepted by the Working
Capital Arbiter. Any determinations made by the Working Capital Arbiter shall
be final, non‑appealable and binding on the Parties hereto, absent manifest
error or fraud.

(vii) Working Capital Adjustment. After the final determination of the Actual
Working Capital in accordance with this Section 2.2(d), the Purchase Price
shall be adjusted as follows:

(A) If the Purchase Price was adjusted pursuant to Section 2.2(d)(i) because
the Estimated Working Capital was less than the Working Capital Target, the
Purchase Price will be further adjusted by comparing the Actual 

Working Capital to the Estimated Working Capital and making any such
adjustment to the Purchase Price (either upward or downward) in order to
reflect the adjustment that would have occurred if the adjustment at Closing
had been made using the Actual Working Capital. In the event that Buyer shall
be entitled to any downward adjustment to the Purchase Price pursuant to this
Section 2.2(d)(vii)(A), such amount shall be paid, at the discretion of Buyer,
by Seller or LivingSocial either (A) from the Escrow Amount (until no Escrow
Amount remains) or (B) directly from Seller or LivingSocial, in either case
within ten (10) Business Days after the date of the final determination of
Actual Working Capital. In the event that Seller shall be entitled to any
upward adjustment to the Purchase Price pursuant to this Section
2.2(d)(vii)(A), such cash amount shall be paid by Buyer by wire transfer of
immediately available funds to an account or accounts designated in writing by
Seller. For the avoidance of doubt, any such upward adjustment shall be
limited to the amount by which the Estimated Working Capital was less than
Working Capital Target at Closing.

(B) If (A) the Purchase Price was not adjusted pursuant to Section 2.2(d)(i)
because the Estimated Working Capital was greater than the Working Capital
Target and (B) the Actual Working Capital is less than the Working Capital
Target, the Purchase Price shall be reduced dollar for dollar by the shortfall
between the Actual Working Capital and the Working Capital Target, and Buyer
shall be entitled to the amount of such reduction, which amount shall be paid,
at the discretion of Buyer, by Seller or LivingSocial either (A) from the
Escrow Amount (until no Escrow Amount remains) or (B) directly from Seller or
LivingSocial, in either case within ten (10) Business Days after the date of
the final determination of Actual Working Capital.

(viii) Closing Cash Adjustment. After the final determination of the Actual
Closing Cash in accordance with this Section 2.2(d), the Purchase Price shall
be adjusted by comparing the Actual Closing Cash to the Estimated Cash and
making any such adjustment to the Purchase Price (either upward or downward)
in order to reflect the adjustment that would have occurred if the adjustment
at Closing had been made with using the Actual Closing Cash. In the event that
Buyer shall be entitled to any downward adjustment to the Purchase Price
pursuant to this Section 2.2(d)(viii), such amount shall be paid, at the
discretion of Buyer, paid by Seller or LivingSocial either (A) from the Escrow
Amount (until no Escrow Amount remains) or (B) directly from Seller or
LivingSocial, in either case within ten (10) Business Days after the date of
the final determination of Actual Closing Cash. In the event that Seller shall
be entitled to any upward adjustment to the Purchase Price pursuant to this
Section 2.2(d)(viii), such cash amount shall be paid by Buyer by wire transfer
of immediately available funds to an account or accounts designated in writing
by Seller; provided that the payment of such amount to Seller will not cause
the Actual Working Capital to be less than the Target Working Capital. 

(e) Setoff. In the event that Buyer or Seller is entitled to any payment from
the other Party due to an adjustment of Working Capital pursuant to Section
2.2(d)(vii), and Buyer or Seller is entitled to any payment from the other
Party due to an adjustment in Closing Cash Payment pursuant to Section
2.2(d)(viii), Buyer or Seller, as applicable, shall be entitled to set off any
such amounts due under Section 2.2(d)(viii) against the amounts payable to
Buyer or Seller under Section 2.2(d)(vii).

(f) Exchange Rate. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Section
2.2(d), any adjustments to the Purchase Price or amounts to be paid pursuant
to this Section 2.2(d), shall be calculated in US Dollars using the exchange
rate at 9:00 a.m. Central Standard Time on the Closing Date as set forth on
the Exchange Site.

(g) Withholding. Parent, Buyer and any of their respective representatives
shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the amounts otherwise payable
pursuant to this Agreement such amounts as Parent, Buyer, Seller, LS Korea, or
the Company is required to deduct and withhold under the Code, or any
applicable provision of U.S. state, local or non‑U.S. Tax Law, with respect to
the making of such payment and to collect from Seller and its Affiliates any
necessary Tax forms, certifications and other reasonably requested information
to ascertain and satisfy such Parties' withholding obligation. To the extent
amounts are so withheld and timely paid over to the appropriate Taxing
Authority, the withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this
Agreement as having been paid to the Person in respect of which such deduction
and withholding was made. For the avoidance of doubt, none of Parent, Buyer or
any of their respective representatives shall withhold any capital gains Tax
imposed in Korea under Article 98(1) of the Corporate Income Tax Law and
Article 96 of the Local Tax Law (the "Korean CGT") in respect of the
consideration under this Agreement provided (i) Seller (A) delivers a copy of
the Tax residency certificate issued by the relevant Taxing Authority in

certificates have been requested but not yet issued by the relevant Taxing
Authority in respect of Seller and LivingSocial, and (ii) Seller shall provide
Buyer with a copy of a completed "Application for Non-Taxation on Korean
Source Income under the Tax Treaty" together with any attachments thereto

in and to (A) all Registered Intellectual Property and (B) all material
unregistered Intellectual Property of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries,
in each case owned by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries (the
"Unregistered Intellectual Property"), free and clear of all Liens (other than
Permitted Liens and nonexclusive licenses or sublicenses granted to others in

Company or one of its Subsidiaries has a valid license or right to use all
other Intellectual Property (other than, to Seller's Knowledge, third party
Patents) used by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries (collectively with the
Registered Intellectual Property and the Unregistered Intellectual Property,

necessary or required for the conduct and operation of the business as

Property shall be owned or available for use by the Company and its
Subsidiaries on terms and conditions identical to those under which the

immediately prior to the Closing Date, except for the effect, directly or
indirectly, resulting from any agreement, contract or understanding to which
Buyer or a Subsidiary of Buyer 

is a party as of the Closing (other than this Agreement). The transactions
contemplated hereby do not and will not trigger any provision under any such
arrangement to (i) renegotiate or increase the license, support or other fees
or charges due under such any arrangement, or (ii) restrict, in any material
way, use of any such Intellectual Property rights by Buyer or a Subsidiary of
Buyer subsequent to the Closing Date. Neither the Company nor any of its
Subsidiaries (I) is infringing upon, violating or misappropriating, or has
infringed upon, violated or misappropriated, the Intellectual Property rights
of any third party (other than the Patents of any third party or through the

respect, is engaged in any unfair trade practice or the passing off of
counterfeit goods, (II) to the Knowledge of Seller, is infringing upon,

Other than as set forth on Section 3.1(q)(i) of the Disclosure Schedule,
neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has received any written
notice alleging any infringement, misappropriation, or violation of any
third‑party Intellectual Property right (including any claim that the Company
or any of its Subsidiaries must license or refrain from using any Intellectual
Property rights of any third party) or alleging unfair trade practices or the
passing off of counterfeit goods that could reasonably be expected to result
in a material claim against the Company or its Subsidiaries. To the Knowledge
of Seller, no third party has violated, infringed upon, or misappropriated any
of the Company Intellectual Property. There are no pending Actions or, to the
Knowledge of Seller, threatened Actions against the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries or their respective employees or, officers, in their capacities
as such, or, to the Knowledge of Seller, independent contractors, alleging
that any of the Company Intellectual Property infringes, misappropriates or
conflicts with the rights of any third party. The current and former employees
and officers of the Company and each of its Subsidiaries who have participated
in the creation of the Company's products have, except as set forth in Section
3.1(q)(i) of the Disclosure Schedule, validly assigned their rights in the
Company Intellectual Property to the Company. The consultants retained by the
Company and its Subsidiaries for the creation of the Company's products have,
except as set forth in Section 3.1(q)(i) of the Disclosure Schedule, entered

Section 3.2 Representations and Warranties of Buyer. Each of Parent and Buyer,
jointly and severally, represents and warrants to Seller and LivingSocial, as
follows:

(a) Organization, Standing and Corporate Power. Buyer is a corporation duly
organized, validly existing and in good standing under the State of Delaware
and has the requisite power and authority to own its properties and assets and
carry on its business as currently conducted. Each of Parent and Buyer has
full power and authority to enter into, consummate the transactions
contemplated by, and carry out its obligations under, each of the Transaction
Agreements to which it is a party. Buyer is duly qualified as a foreign
corporation to do business, and is in good standing, in each jurisdiction
where the character of its owned, operated or leased assets or properties or
the nature of its activities makes such qualification and good standing
necessary, except where the failure to be so qualified or in good standing
could not reasonably be expected to have a material adverse effect on the
ability of Buyer to perform its obligations under this Agreement or any
Transaction Agreement to which it is a party or to consummate the transactions
contemplated hereby or thereby. The execution and delivery by each of Parent
and Buyer of each of the Transaction Agreements to which it is a party, the
performance by each of Parent and Buyer of its 

obligations under each of the Transaction Agreements to which it is a party
and the consummation by each of Parent and Buyer of the transactions
contemplated by each of the Transaction Agreements to which it is a party,
have been or will be prior to the Closing (as applicable) duly authorized by
all requisite corporate action on the part of Buyer and by all requisite
corporate action on the part of Parent. Each of the Transaction Agreements to
which each of Parent and Buyer is a party has been, or upon execution and
delivery thereof, will be, duly executed and delivered by Parent and Buyer, as
applicable. Assuming due authorization, execution and delivery by the other
parties hereto or thereto, each of the Transaction Agreements to which Parent
and Buyer is a party constitutes, or upon execution and delivery thereof will
constitute, the legal, valid and binding obligation of each of Parent and
Buyer, enforceable against it in accordance with its terms.

(b) Non‑Contravention; Consents.

(i) The execution, delivery and performance by Buyer and Parent of each
Transaction Agreement to which it is a party does not, and the consummation of
the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby will not, (A) conflict with
any of the provisions of its Constituent Documents; or (B) subject to the
matters referred to in Section 3.2(b)(ii), materially contravene any
Requirements of Law applicable to Buyer or Parent.

(ii) No consent, approval or authorization of, or declaration or filing with,
or notice to, any Governmental Entity is required to be made by Buyer or
Parent in connection with the execution and delivery of any Transaction
Agreement by Buyer to which it is a party or the consummation by Buyer of any
of the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby, except for the approvals,
filings and notices required under the FTL.

(c) Brokers. No broker, investment banker, financial advisor or other Person
is entitled to any brokers', finders', financial advisors' or similar fee or
commission in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
based upon arrangements made by or on behalf of Buyer or Parent any of their
respective Affiliates, except those for which Buyer or Parent will be solely
responsible.

(d) NASDAQ Listing. Shares of Parent Common Stock are traded on the NASDAQ
Global Select Market. There is no action pending or, to Parent's knowledge,
threatened against Parent with respect to any intention by NASDAQ or any

material respects with the applicable listing and maintenance requirements of
the NASDAQ Global Select Market.

(e) Valid Issuance. All of the shares of Parent Common Stock issuable to
Seller pursuant to this Agreement will, when issued in accordance with the
provisions of this Agreement, be validly issued, fully paid and
non‑assessable, and the issuance thereof is not subject to and will not be

date hereof, Parent has reserved out of its authorized but unissued shares of
Parent 

Common Stock, a sufficient number of shares of Parent Common Stock to issue
all of the shares of Parent Common Stock that may be issued to Seller pursuant
to this Agreement.

(f) Capital Resources. Buyer will have sufficient cash resources at Closing to
pay the cash portion of the Purchase Price.

(g) SEC Documents.

(i) Since January 1, 2012, Parent has filed on a timely basis all reports,
schedules, forms, statements and other documents (including exhibits and all
other information incorporated therein) required to be filed by Parent with
the SEC (the "SEC Documents"). As of their respective dates, the SEC Documents
complied as to form in all material respects with the requirements of the
Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "Securities Act") or the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act"), as the case may be, and
the rules and regulations of the SEC promulgated thereunder applicable to such
SEC Documents and, except to the extent that information contained in any SEC
Document has been revised, amended, modified or superseded (prior to the date
of this Agreement) by a later filed SEC Document, none of the SEC Documents
when filed contained any untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to
state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to
make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they
were made, not misleading. As of the Effective Date, Parent is a Well Known
Seasoned Issuer as defined in Rule 405 under the Securities Act and is
eligible to use Form S-3 to register its equity securities under the
Securities Act for resale on a continuous basis on an automatic shelf
registration statement that will become effective immediately pursuant to Rule
462(e) and (f) upon filing with the SEC.

(ii) The consolidated financial statements (including any related notes and
schedules) contained or incorporated by reference in the SEC Documents: (A)
complied as to form in all material respects with the published rules and
regulations of the SEC applicable thereto; (B) were prepared in accordance
with US GAAP applied on a consistent basis throughout the periods covered
(except as may be indicated in the notes to such financial statements or as
permitted by Regulation S-X, or, in the case of unaudited financial
statements, as permitted by Form 10-Q, Form 8-K or any successor form under
the Exchange Act); and (C) fairly present, in all material respects, the
consolidated financial position of Parent and its consolidated Subsidiaries as
of the respective dates thereof and the consolidated results of operations and
cash flows of Parent and its consolidated Subsidiaries for the periods covered
thereby (subject, in the case of the unaudited financial statements, to normal
and recurring year-end adjustments that are not material).

(iii) Parent maintains a system of internal controls over financial reporting
(as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) which is
designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of
financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external
purposes in 

accordance with GAAP, and includes those policies and procedures that: (A)
pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and
fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of Parent and
its consolidated Subsidiaries; (B) provide reasonable assurance that
transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial
statements in conformity with GAAP and that receipts and expenditures are
being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors
of Parent; and (C) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely
detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the assets of
Parent and its consolidated Subsidiaries that could have a material effect on
the financial statements. Parent's management has completed an assessment of
the effectiveness of Parent's system of internal controls over financial
reporting in compliance with the requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-
Oxley Act for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2012, and, as amended, except
as set forth in the SEC Documents filed prior to the date of this Agreement,
such assessment concluded that such controls were effective and Parent's
independent registered accountant has issued (and not subsequently withdrawn
or qualified) an attestation report concluding that Parent maintained
effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2012.
To the Knowledge of Parent, except as set forth in the SEC Documents filed
prior to the date of this Agreement, since January 1, 2012, neither Parent nor
Parent's independent registered accountant has identified or been made aware
of: (x) any material weakness in the design or operation of internal control
over financial reporting utilized by Parent; or (y) any material illegal act
or fraud involving Parent or its consolidated subsidiaries.

(iv) Parent maintains disclosure controls and procedures required by Rule
13a-15 or 15d-15 under the Exchange Act that are reasonably designed to ensure
that all information required to be disclosed in Parent's reports that it
files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and
reported within the time periods specified in the rules and forms of the SEC
and that all such information is accumulated and communicated to Parent's
management as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required
disclosure and to enable each of the principal executive officer of Parent and
the principal financial officer of Parent to make the certifications required
under the Exchange Act with respect to such reports.

(v) As of the Effective Date, there are no outstanding or unresolved comments
in comment letters received from the SEC with respect to the SEC Documents.

(h) Non-Reliance. Neither Parent nor Buyer is relying and neither Parent nor
Buyer has relied on any representations or warranties whatsoever regarding the
subject matter of this Agreement, express or implied, except for the
representations and warranties expressly set forth in this Agreement. Such
representations and warranties by Seller and LivingSocial constitute the sole
and exclusive representations and warranties of Seller and LivingSocial in
connection with the transactions contemplated hereunder and each of Parent and
Buyer understands, acknowledges and agrees that all other representations and 

warranties of any kind or nature whether express, implied or statutory are
specifically disclaimed by Seller, LivingSocial and the Company.

Seller in advance and, to the extent permitted by such Governmental Entity,
gives Seller the opportunity to attend and participate at such meeting.

Section 4.4 Public Announcements. On the Effective Date, each Party may issue

advisable by such Party's legal counsel pursuant to, the rules of the
applicable National Securities Exchange or any applicable Requirements of Law.

as a remedy and without the necessity of posting any bond or other security,

penalty) by December 31, 2013 and (b) LS Korea's, the Company's and each of
its Subsidiaries' participation in all Affiliate Agreements shall, in each
case, be terminated and discharged without any further liability or obligation
to LS Korea, the Company and each of its Subsidiaries thereunder (or any
premium or penalty) effective at the Closing. Section 4.10 of the Disclosure
Schedule sets forth the manner in which one or more of the Affiliate
Agreements shall 

be settled and discharged. Seller and LivingSocial will provide all
documentation related to the settlement of all such Affiliate Agreements set
forth on such Section 4.10 of the Disclosure Schedule to Buyer at least five
(5) days prior to execution for review and comment.

Company shall take all necessary corporate action, in a manner satisfactory to
Parent, to terminate the terminable Employee Benefit Plans of the Company and
its Subsidiaries listed in Section 4.11 of the Disclosure Schedule, effective
as of the date immediately prior to the Closing Date, but contingent on the
Closing; provided, however, that the Company shall not be obligated to
terminate or amend any Employee Benefit Plans to the extent such termination
or amendment would be unfavorable to employees of the Company and require
employee approval under Korean Law.

Section 4.12 Tax Matters.



(a) Buyer, Seller, LS Korea, the Company and LivingSocial shall cooperate
fully, as and to the extent reasonably requested by any of them or their
Affiliates or representatives, in connection with the filing of any LS Korea,
Company (and any Subsidiary of the Company) Tax Return or amended Tax Return
and any audit, litigation or other proceeding with respect to Taxes of LS
Korea, the Company and its Subsidiaries for any Pre‑Closing Tax Year and any
Straddle Period. Such cooperation shall include the retention and (upon
another party's request) the provision of records and information which are
reasonably relevant to any such Tax Return, audit, litigation or other
proceeding and making employees available on a mutually convenient basis to
provide additional information and explanation of any material provided
hereunder. Buyer, Seller, LS Korea, the Company and LivingSocial agree to (i)
retain all books and records with respect to Tax matters pertinent to LS
Korea, the Company and its Subsidiaries relating to any taxable period
beginning before the Closing Date until the expiration of the statute of
limitations (and, to the extent notified by Buyer or the Company, any
extensions thereof) of the respective taxable periods, and to abide by all
record retention agreements entered into with any taxing authority, and (ii)
give the other parties reasonable written notice prior to transferring,
destroying or discarding any such books and records and, if any other party so
requests, Buyer, LS Korea or the Company, as the case may be, shall allow the
other parties to take possession of such books and records. Buyer and Seller
further agree, upon request, to use their reasonable best efforts to obtain
any certificate or other document from any Governmental Entity or any other
Person as may be necessary to mitigate, reduce or eliminate any Tax of LS
Korea, the Company, its Subsidiaries, Seller or Buyer that could be imposed
(including, but not limited to, with respect to the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement).

(b)

(i) LivingSocial shall prepare and file (or cause to be prepared and filed)
all Tax Returns relating to LS Korea, the Company or its Subsidiaries for Tax
periods ending on or before the Closing Date (the "Seller Prepared Returns"),
which Tax Returns shall be prepared in accordance with past practices and
customs and which 

shall be prepared by an internationally recognized accounting firm in
accordance with applicable Law. LivingSocial shall provide Buyer with copies
of each Seller Prepared Return the due date for which is after Closing at
least fifteen (15) days prior to the due date for filing such Tax Returns (or
in the case of Seller Prepared Returns that are required to be filed fewer
than twenty (20) days following Closing, as soon as practicable prior to such
deadline) for review and comment, shall consider any reasonable comments to
such Tax Returns requested by Buyer and shall not file such Seller Prepared
Returns without the consent of Buyer, which consent shall not be unreasonably
withheld, delayed or conditioned; provided, however, LivingSocial's obligation
to provide the 2013 consolidated income Tax Return for LS Korea, the Company
and its Subsidiaries to Buyer shall be contingent upon Buyer providing the
2013 Korean GAAP audited financials for LS Korea, the Company and its
Subsidiaries no later than March 1, 2014. LivingSocial shall timely make or
cause to be made all payments required with respect to any such Tax Returns;
provided, however, that the amount of any payment that constitutes a Pre-
Closing Tax shall be subject to the indemnification procedures set forth in
Article VII of this Agreement.

(ii) Buyer shall prepare and file (or cause to be prepared and filed) all Tax
Returns relating to LS Korea, the Company and its Subsidiaries that are
required to be filed after the Closing Date other than Seller Prepared Returns
(the "Buyer Prepared Returns"). To the extent that any Buyer Prepared Return
includes a Pre‑Closing Tax Year or any Straddle Period, Buyer shall provide
each such Buyer Prepared Return to LivingSocial and Seller for review and
comment at least fifteen (15) days prior to the due date for filing such Tax
Returns, shall consider any reasonable comments to such Tax Returns as
requested by LivingSocial and Seller, and shall not file any such Buyer
Prepared Returns without the consent of LivingSocial and Seller, which consent
shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed. Buyer shall make
all payments required with respect to any such Tax Returns; provided, however,
that the amount of any payment that constitutes a Pre‑Closing Tax shall be
subject to the indemnification procedures set forth in Article VII of this
Agreement.

(c) Each of Parent and Buyer, on one hand, and LivingSocial and Seller, on the
other hand, shall promptly notify the other in writing upon receipt of a
written notice of any issues in any pending or threatened Tax audits or
assessments with respect to Taxes for any Pre-Closing Tax Years ("Tax Contest
Claims"); provided, however, that no failure or delay to provide notice of a
Tax Contest Claim shall reduce or otherwise affect the obligations of the
Parties hereunder unless such Party was prejudiced thereby and then only to
the extent of such prejudice. This Section 4.12(c) shall govern all Tax
Contest Claims.

(i) LivingSocial and Seller, at their election, shall control the conduct of
any Tax Contest Claim, other than a Tax Contest Claim related to a Straddle
Period, at its sole cost and expense; provided, however, that (A) LivingSocial
and Seller must consult, in good faith with Parent regarding the taking of any
action with respect 

to the conduct of such Tax Contest Claim and shall keep Parent and Buyer
informed regarding the progress and substantive aspects of any such Tax
Contest Claim, including providing Parent and Buyer with all written materials
relating to such Tax Contest Claim received from the relevant Taxing Authority
and all written materials submitted to such Taxing Authority by LivingSocial
and Seller, (B) Parent and Buyer shall be entitled to participate in any such
Tax Contest Claim at its own cost and expense, including having an opportunity
to comment on any written materials prepared for submission to a Taxing
Authority in connection with any such Tax Contest Claim and attending any
conferences relating to any such Tax Contest Claim, and (C) LivingSocial and
Seller shall not compromise or settle any such Tax Contest Claim without
obtaining Parent's prior written consent, not to be unreasonably withheld,
delayed or conditioned. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event that
LivingSocial and Seller have filed for bankruptcy or have sold substantially
all of their assets at the time any Tax Contest Claim commences, LivingSocial
and Seller shall not be permitted to control the conduct of any Tax Contest
Claim or have any rights pursuant to this Section 4.12. If LivingSocial and
Seller have the right and elect to control the conduct of any Tax Contest
Claim pursuant to this Section 4.12(c)(i), LivingSocial and Seller shall
deliver to Parent and Buyer written notice of such election within thirty (30)
days of receipt of notice from a Taxing Authority of such Tax Contest Claim,
certifying to Parent and Buyer that LivingSocial and Seller are (x) permitted
to control the conduct of such Tax Contest Claim and (y) affirmatively
electing to control such audit ("Election Notice"). If LivingSocial and Seller
have the right, but fail to timely deliver an Election Notice, Parent and
Buyer shall have the exclusive right to control, negotiate, compromise and
settle such Tax Contest Claim.

(ii) Parent or Buyer shall control the conduct of any issues in any Tax
Contest Claim in respect of Taxes for Straddle Periods; provided, however,
that to the extent such Tax Contest Claim could reasonably be expected to
result in an indemnification obligation pursuant to the terms of this
Agreement (A) Parent must consult, in good faith, with LivingSocial and Seller
regarding the taking of any action with respect to the conduct of such Tax
Contest Claim and Parent and Buyer shall keep LivingSocial and Seller informed
regarding the progress and substantive aspects of any such Tax Contest Claim,
including providing LivingSocial and Seller with all written materials
relating to such Tax Contest Claim received from the relevant Taxing Authority
and all written materials submitted to such Taxing Authority by Parent or
Buyer, (B) LivingSocial and Seller shall be entitled to participate in any
such Tax Contest Claim at its own cost and expense, including having an
opportunity to comment on any written materials prepared for submission to a
Taxing Authority in connection with any such Tax Contest Claim and to attend
any conferences relating to any such Tax Contest Claim and (C) Buyer and
Parent shall not compromise or settle any such Tax Contest Claim without
obtaining the prior written consent of LivingSocial and Seller, which consent
shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned, or delayed. 

(d) Neither Buyer nor any Affiliate (including LS Korea and the Company after
Closing) of Buyer shall file, amend, re‑file or otherwise modify any Tax
Return relating in whole or in part to LS Korea or the Company for any periods
(or portion thereof) ending on or before the Closing Date without the prior
written consent of Seller, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld,
delayed or conditioned. Seller shall be entitled to receive payment from Buyer
or any of its Affiliates (including LS Korea and the Company after Closing) of
any refund of Taxes (including refunds arising by reason of amended Tax
Returns filed after the Closing Date or otherwise, except to the extent
attributable to any Tax Attribute arising in a Tax period beginning after the
Closing Date), but excluding any Tax receivables included in the calculation
of Actual Working Capital, with respect to any Pre‑Closing Tax Year of LS
Korea or the Company, actually received by Buyer or any of its Affiliates
(including LS Korea and the Company after Closing) (each a "Tax Refund") as
additional consideration in connection with the Transaction. Buyer and its
Affiliates (including LS Korea and the Company after Closing) shall cooperate
with Seller, to the extent reasonably requested, in obtaining any Tax Refund
to which Seller is entitled under this Section 4.12. Each Tax Refund shall be
paid in cash by Buyer, or its applicable Affiliate, to Seller within thirty
(30) days of Buyer's or its applicable Affiliate's receipt of any such Tax
Refund from a Governmental Entity (including any Taxing Authority).
Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, in the event that
a Tax Refund to which Seller is entitled under this Section 4.12 is
subsequently determined by any Governmental Entity (including any Taxing
Authority) to be less than the amount paid to Seller by Buyer or its
applicable Affiliate, Seller shall promptly return any such disallowed amounts
(plus any interest in respect of such disallowed refunds owed to a
Governmental Entity (including any Taxing Authority)) to Buyer or its
Affiliate, as applicable. Any such Tax Refund payable pursuant to this Section
4.12(e) shall be reduced (i) for any additional Taxes incurred in connection
with the receipt or payment of such Tax Refund to the extent such Taxes are
attributable to a Pre-Closing Tax Year and (ii) any reasonable out‑of‑pocket
expenses incurred by Buyer or any of its Affiliates (including LS Korea and
the Company after Closing) in connection with obtaining such Tax Refund.
Further, notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, Buyer
shall have an obligation to pursue Tax Refunds as reasonably requested by
Seller.

(e) The Parties acknowledge that Buyer may make an election (or elections)
pursuant to Section 338(g) of the Code ("Section 338(g) Election") and further
acknowledge that neither the Parent nor Buyer shall have any obligation to
indemnify LivingSocial or Seller for any Taxes which arise from such Section
338(g) Election. For the avoidance of doubt, any Tax liability of LS Korea,
the Company or its Subsidiaries from such Section 338(g) Election shall be
included in Pre-Closing Taxes.

(f) If Buyer receives an order from any Taxing Authority requiring payment of
any Korean CGT which Seller is primarily liable to pay, Seller shall pay an
amount equal to such Korean CGT, including any penalty or interest thereon, to
the relevant Taxing Authority or Buyer. All Transfer Taxes which arise from
the Transaction shall be borne and paid 50% by Seller and 50% by Buyer, and
Seller shall, at its own expense, file all necessary Tax Returns and other
documentation with respect to all such Transfer Taxes. 

(g) Buyer shall withhold pursuant to Section 2.2(g) 50% of the amount of
Securities Transaction Tax due with respect to the LS Korea Shares purchased
pursuant to the terms of this Agreement. Buyer shall pay to the applicable
Taxing Authorities 100% of the amount of Securities Transaction Tax due with
respect to the LS Korea Shares purchased pursuant to the terms of this
Agreement and shall, at its own expense, file all required reports or returns
applicable thereto.

Section 4.13 Termination of Signing and Withdrawal Powers. At least five (5)
Business Days prior to the Closing Date, Seller shall cause LS Korea, the
Company and each of its Subsidiaries to deliver written notification to any
financial institution which maintains, on behalf of LS Korea, the Company and
each of its Subsidiaries, any account or safe deposit box listed in Section
3.1(u) of the Disclosure Schedule notifying each such financial institution
that the signing or withdrawal powers or other authority of all Persons with
respect to such accounts and safe deposit boxes are revoked immediately upon
receipt by such financial institution of such notice.

shall cause the Company to, prior to the Closing, sell or otherwise dispose of
the Malaysian Business.

Section 4.15 Issuance of Shares; Registration Statement.

(a) Parent shall file a shelf registration statement on Form S‑3 (the
"Registration Statement") to become effective automatically upon filing under
Paragraph D of the General Instructions of Form S‑3 on or prior to the
Registration Deadline. The "Registration Deadline" shall be (x) the same
Business Day as the Closing Date if the Closing occurs before 10:00 a.m.
Central Standard Time on the Closing Date or (y) one (1) Business Day
following the Closing Date if the Closing occurs after 10:00 a.m. Central
Standard Time on the Closing Date; provided, that in either case, Parent shall
have received, prior to the Closing, the consent of PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP
to incorporate by reference the LS Korea Financial Statements into the
Registration Statement. The Registration Statement may be used for the resale
from time to time by Seller, its direct and indirect parent companies and
LivingSocial (as applicable, the "Selling Stockholder") of all Parent Shares
issued pursuant to this Agreement in accordance with the intended method of
distribution thereof as set forth in the Registration Statement The
Registration Statement shall comply as to form in all material respects with
the Securities Act and Form S‑3\. Parent shall, at the request of Seller file
any post‑effective amendments and otherwise take any action necessary to
include therein all disclosure and language deemed necessary to effect the
distribution of the Parent Shares; provided, however, that reasonably in
advance before filing the Registration Statement or prospectus or any
amendments or supplements thereto, or comparable statements under securities
or state "blue sky" laws of any jurisdiction, or any free writing prospectus
related thereto or before sending a response to an SEC comment letter related
to the Registration Statement prior to such filing, Parent will furnish to
counsel for Seller copies of reasonably complete drafts of all such documents
proposed to be filed (including all exhibits thereto and each document
incorporated by reference therein to the extent then required by the rules and
regulations of the SEC), which documents will be subject to the reasonable
review and reasonable comment of such counsel (including any objections to 

any information pertaining to Seller and its plan of distribution and
otherwise to the extent necessary, if at all, to complete the filing or
maintain the effectiveness thereof), and Parent shall make the changes
reasonably requested by such counsel and shall not file any Registration
Statement or amendment thereto, any prospectus or supplement thereto or any
free writing prospectus related thereto to which Seller shall reasonably
object), provided that, notwithstanding the foregoing, in no event shall
Parent be required to file any document with the SEC which, in the view of
Parent or its counsel, contains an untrue statement of a material fact or
omits to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to
make any statement therein not misleading.

(b) Parent shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause the Registration
Statement to remain continuously effective, including preparing and filing
with the SEC such amendments and supplements (including, without limitation,
any reports required to be filed pursuant to the Exchange Act) to such
Registration Statement and the prospectus used in connection therewith as may
be necessary to keep such Registration Statement continuously effective until
such date as is the earlier of (A) the date on which all Parent Shares
included in the Registration Statement shall have been sold; or (B) the date
on which all Parent Shares may be sold during any thirty (30) day period
without any restriction, including volume limitation, pursuant to Rule 144
under the Securities Act or any restriction under this Agreement.

(c) It shall be a condition precedent to the obligations of Parent under this
section that the Selling Stockholder shall furnish to Parent such information
regarding itself, the Parent Shares held by it and the intended method of
disposition of such securities as shall be required to effect the
registration.

(d) All expenses incurred by Parent in connection with its performance of its
obligations under or in compliance with this Section 4.15 shall be borne by
Parent. All selling and other expenses (including attorney fees) incurred by
the Selling Stockholder in connection with sales of Parent Shares under the
Registration Statement shall be borne by the Selling Stockholder.

(e) The Selling Stockholder acknowledges that pending registration of the
Parent Shares as contemplated by this Section 4.15, the Parent Shares shall
bear customary restrictive legends in accordance with applicable securities
laws.

(f) Parent shall promptly notify Seller: (i) when the Registration Statement,
any pre‑effective amendment, the prospectus or any prospectus supplement
related thereto, any post‑effective amendment to the registration statement or
any free writing prospectus has been filed with the SEC and, with respect to
the registration statement or any post‑effective amendment, when the same has
become effective; (ii) of the issuance by the SEC of any stop order suspending
the effectiveness of the Registration Statement or the initiation of any
proceedings for that purpose, (iii) of the receipt of any comment letter or
request by the SEC or state securities authority for amendments or supplements
to the Registration Statement or the prospectus related thereto or for
additional information; (iv) of the receipt by Parent of any notification with
respect to the suspension of the qualification of any Parent Shares 

for sale under the securities or state "blue sky" laws of any jurisdiction or
the initiation of any proceeding for such purpose; and (v) of the existence of
any fact of which Parent becomes aware which results in the Registration
Statement or any amendment thereto, the prospectus related thereto or any
supplement thereto, any document incorporated therein by reference, any free
writing prospectus or the information conveyed to Seller at the time of sale
to Seller containing an untrue statement of a material fact or omitting to
state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make any
statement therein not misleading; and, if the notification relates to an event
described in clause (v), subject to the following sentence, Parent shall
promptly prepare, file and furnish to Seller any prospectus supplement or
post-effective amendment that shall not include an untrue statement of a
material fact or omit to state a material fact required to be stated therein
or necessary to make the statements therein in the light of the circumstances
under which they were made not misleading. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
Parent shall not be required to promptly prepare, file or furnish a prospectus
supplement or post-effective amendment if public disclosure of such material
non-public information, in the Board of Directors of Parent's good faith
judgment after consultation with counsel would not be required to be made at
such time but for the filing, effectiveness or continued use of such
Registration Statement; and Parent has a bona fide business purpose for not
disclosing publicly (other than avoidance of its obligations hereunder), such
as financial results, a potential material acquisition, divestiture of assets
or other material corporate transaction and the disclosure of such information
would reasonably be expected to have a materially adverse effect on Parent.

(g) Notwithstanding anything in this Section 4.15 to the contrary but subject
to Section 4.15(f) above and Section 4.15(m) below, if Parent determines, in
its reasonable judgment, that the Registration Statement or related prospectus
contains an untrue statement of a material fact or omits to state a material
fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein
not misleading, then Parent may, upon giving written notice of such to Selling
Stockholder, subject to Section 4.15(f), delay the filing or initial
effectiveness of, or suspend use of, the Registration Statement. In the event
that Parent exercises its rights under the preceding sentence, the Selling
Stockholder agrees to immediately suspend its use of the Registration
Statement and any prospectus thereunder in connection with any sale or offer
to sell Parent Shares. Any such notice shall be treated as confidential by the
Selling Stockholder.

(h) Parent shall cause all such Parent Shares covered by such Registration
Statement to be listed on the principal National Securities Exchange on which
similar securities issued by Parent are then listed on or prior to the Closing
Date and comply (and continue to comply) with the requirements of any self
regulatory organization applicable to Parent, including all corporate
governance requirements.

(i) Subject to Section 4.15(f), Parent shall use its reasonable best efforts
to prevent the issuance or obtain the withdrawal of any order suspending the
effectiveness of the registration statement, or the lifting of any suspension
of the qualification of any of Parent Shares for sale in any jurisdiction, in
each case, as promptly as reasonably practicable. 

(j) Parent shall indemnify and hold harmless to the fullest extent permitted
by Law, the Selling Stockholder and each of its officers, directors, and each
person controlling the Selling Stockholder within the meaning of Section 15 of
the Securities Act, from and against any losses, claims, damages or
liabilities, joint or several, actions or proceedings and expenses (including
reasonable fees of counsel and other expenses reasonably incurred in
connection with investigating or defending any such loss, claim, damage or
liability and amounts paid in any settlement effect with Parent's consent, to
which any indemnified party may become subject (under the Securities Act or
otherwise) insofar as such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions
or proceedings in respect thereof) arise out of, or are based upon, (i) any
untrue statement of a material fact or alleged untrue statement of fact
contained in the Registration Statement or any omission or alleged omission to
state therein a fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the
statements therein not misleading, or (ii) any untrue or alleged untrue
statement of a material fact contained in any preliminary, final or summary
prospectus or any amendment or supplement thereto, together with the documents
incorporated by reference therein, or any free writing prospectus utilized in
connection therewith, or the omission or alleged omission to state therein a
material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the
statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were
made, not misleading; provided, however, that Parent will not be liable in any
such case to the extent that any such loss, claim, damage or liability arises
out of or is based upon (i) any untrue statement or omission, made in reliance
upon and in conformity with written information furnished to Parent by or on
behalf of the Selling Stockholder specifically for use in the preparation of
the Registration Statement, or (ii) the failure of the Selling Stockholder to
comply with the covenants and agreements applicable to the Selling
Stockholder.

(k) The Selling Stockholder agrees to indemnify and hold harmless Parent, and
their respective directors and officers, and each Person, if any, who controls
(within the meaning of Section 15 of the Act or Section 20 of the Exchange
Act) the Company, or to the same extent as the foregoing indemnity from Parent
set forth in Section 4.15(j) above, but only with reference to information
furnished in writing to the Parent by or on behalf of the Selling Stockholder
specifically for use in the preparation of the Registration Statement. The
Selling Stockholder will reimburse Parent and each of its officers, directors
and partners and each person controlling Parent, as the case may be, for any
reasonable legal and any other expenses reasonably incurred in connection with
investigating, preparing or defending any such loss, claim, damage or
liability; provided, however, that the liability of the Selling Stockholder
under this Section 4.15(k) shall be limited to an amount equal to the net
proceeds of the Parent Shares sold by the Selling Stockholder hereunder,
unless such liability arises out of or is based on fraud or willful misconduct
by the Selling Stockholder.

(l) Each Party entitled to indemnification under this Section 4.15 (the
"Section 4.15 Indemnified Party") shall give notice to the Party required to
provide indemnification (the "Section 4.15 Indemnifying Party") promptly after
such Section 4.15 Indemnified Party has actual knowledge of any claim as to
which indemnity may be sought, and shall permit the Section 4.15 Indemnifying
Party to assume the defense of any such claim or any litigation resulting
therefrom, provided that counsel for the Section 4.15 

Indemnifying Party, who shall conduct the defense of such claim or litigation,
shall be approved by the Section 4.15 Indemnified Party (whose approval shall
not unreasonably be withheld), and the Section 4.15 Indemnified Party may
participate in such defense at such Party's expense, and provided further that
the failure of any Section 4.15 Indemnified Party to give notice as provided
herein shall not relieve the Section 4.15 Indemnifying Party of its
obligations under this Agreement unless the failure to file such notice is
materially prejudicial to an Section 4.15 Indemnifying Party's ability to
defend such action and provided further, that the Section 4.15 Indemnifying
Party shall not assume the defense for matters as to which there is a conflict
of interest or there are separate and different defenses. No Section 4.15
Indemnifying Party, in the defense of any such claim or litigation, shall,
except with the consent of each Section 4.15 Indemnified Party (whose consent
shall not be unreasonably withheld), consent to entry of any judgment or enter
into any settlement which does not include as an unconditional term thereof
the giving by the claimant or plaintiff to such Section 4.15 Indemnified Party
of a release from all liability in respect to such claim or litigation. The
provisions of this Section 4.15 shall govern any indemnification pursuant to
this Section 4.15, notwithstanding the provisions of Article VII or any other
provisions hereof.

(m) If, as of the Registration Deadline, Parent does not have an effective
Registration Statement, Parent shall repurchase from the Selling Stockholder
for cash $100,000,000 of the Parent Shares issued at Closing, with the number
of shares to be repurchased equal to $100,000,000 divided by the average
closing price of such shares on the National Securities Exchange on which the
shares of Parent Common Stock were listed for trading during the ten (10) day
trading period prior to the Closing Date ("Parent Share Price"). If (i) Parent
does not have an effective Registration Statement as of the Registration
Deadline and during the continuous period beginning on the Registration
Deadline and ending on the date that is forty-five (45) days after the
Registration Deadline, or (ii) following the effectiveness of the Registration
Statement, the Registration Statement is suspended pursuant to Section
4.15(f), and such suspension continues for a period of more than forty-five
(45) days, then Parent shall promptly give written notice of such event to the
Selling Stockholder (an "Unavailability Notice"). Promptly thereafter, the
Parent shall repurchase any Parent Shares that the Selling Stockholder
continues to hold for the Parent Share Price for each such share. If Parent
repurchases Parent Shares pursuant to this Section 4.15(m), then the Selling
Stockholder shall transfer and deliver to Parent such Parent Shares, duly
endorsed for transfer to Parent, together with such other transfer
documentation reasonably requested by Parent at the time of its delivery
against delivery of the purchase price.

(n) After the Closing, Seller will be permitted to sell Parent Shares,
provided that it does not sell, in a single trading day, shares representing
more than ten percent (10%) of the average daily trading volume of Parent
("ADTV") on the principal National Securities Exchange, as measured over the
previous five (5) trading days (on a rolling basis). Notwithstanding the
foregoing, Seller will be permitted to sell in a single trading day more than
ten percent (10%) of the ADTV; provided that such sales are carried out by
means of block trades of Parent Shares that in the aggregate are valued at
least One Hundred Million U.S. Dollars ($100,000,000) (or such lesser amount
equal to the value of the Parent Shares 

actually delivered if Parent does not deliver Parent Shares valued at least
One Hundred Million U.S. Dollars ($100,000,000) pursuant to Section
2.2(a)(ii)); provided further that such block trades are executed by JP Morgan
Chase or another dealer agreed to in advance by Parent and Seller, at a
discount of no more than five percent (5%) to Parent's prevailing share price
at the time of such trade and Parent shall reasonably cooperate in any such
sale.

Section 4.16 Release. Effective as of the Closing Date and subject to the
Closing occurring, each of LivingSocial and Seller does hereby unconditionally
and irrevocably forever release and discharge LS Korea, the Company and each
of the officers and directors of LS Korea and the Company and its Affiliates,

in equity) each of LivingSocial and Seller has or may have against LS Korea,
the Company or any of their officers, directors, employees, agents or
Affiliates arising in connection with LivingSocial's ownership of Seller,
Seller's ownership of the LS Korea Shares, LS Korea's ownership of the Company
or status as a shareholder of the Company (but not any other status) during
any period on or prior to the Closing Date, other than without limitation (x)
any rights under this Agreement or any certificate delivered pursuant to this
Agreement, (y) any rights of directors and officers of the Company to
indemnification and exculpation pursuant to the organizational documents of
the Company, indemnification agreements entered into between such directors or
officers and the Company or otherwise as allowed by Law, and (z) any rights of
Seller against any of the Knowledge Individuals with respect to any
information contained in any certificate delivered by such Knowledge
Individual to Seller in connection with this Agreement.

Section 4.17 Employees. Seller will notify Buyer in writing as soon as
reasonably practicable after the Company enters into any agreement or other
arrangement to (i) pay any bonus or other compensation to any member of the
current Company management team in connection with the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement or otherwise outside the Ordinary Course of
Business or (ii) repurchase or redeem any equity interests held by (or on
behalf of) any member of the current Company management team.

its Subsidiaries.

The inclusion of any offering by LivingSocial or its Subsidiaries shall not be
considered a competitive business activity if the offering is made outside the
Republic of Korea and not targeted to residents of the Republic of Korea
(regardless of whether any such residents of the Republic of Korea decide to
purchase or participate in such offering)

(ii) Subject to Section 4.18(e) below, each of LivingSocial and Seller agrees
and consents that there exists valid and sufficient consideration and agrees
that for an additional two (2) years after the completion of the
Non‑Competition Period, none of LivingSocial, Seller or any of their
respective Subsidiaries shall, directly or indirectly, acquire an entity,
through asset purchase, merger, or otherwise, in the Republic of Korea, that
engages or participates in any business activity that is directly or
indirectly in competition with the business of the Company or its Subsidiaries
(other than the Malaysian Subsidiary) as conducted by the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries in the Republic of Korea as of the Effective Date.

(c) Non‑Solicitation of Employees. Each of LivingSocial and Seller agrees that
during the Non‑Solicitation Period, neither LivingSocial nor Seller shall,
directly or indirectly, in any manner (whether as an owner, stockholder,
officer, director, partner, manager, joint venturer, employee, independent
contractor, consultant, agent or otherwise), solicit for employment or other
services, or employ or engage as a consultant any director‑level or above
employee of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries as of the Closing ("Covered
Employee"); provided, that any general advertisement or listing of employment
positions not targeted to residents of the Republic of Korea shall not be
deemed a solicitation for employment and nothing herein shall preclude
LivingSocial or Seller either soliciting or hiring as an employee or
consultant any Covered Employee whose employment with the Company or its
Affiliates terminated prior to such solicitation or employment.

(d) Acknowledgment. Each of LivingSocial and Seller acknowledges that each of
the restrictions agreed to by them in this Section 4.18 is reasonable, giving
consideration to the interests of each of the Parties to this Agreement, and
that they are necessary to protect the interests of Buyer and Parent. The
Parties further acknowledge that the duration and 

calculation of the term specified in Section 4.18(a) are appropriate given the
circumstances surrounding this Agreement.

(e) Change of Control. Notwithstanding anything else contained in this
Agreement to the contrary, in the event of a change of control of LivingSocial
or Seller, the provisions of this Section 4.18 shall not apply to any such
Person who then controls LivingSocial or Seller or such Person's Affiliates
(exclusive of LivingSocial and Seller) following such change of control;
provided, however, that this Section 4.18 shall continue to apply to any
direct or indirect activities of LivingSocial or Seller (including, without
limitation, any direct or indirect use of the assets of LivingSocial or Seller
(including Intellectual Property) by such Person who controls LivingSocial or
Seller or such Person's Affiliates (exclusive of LivingSocial and Seller).

(f) Remedies. If any Party breaches, or threatens to commit a breach of, any
of the covenants set forth in this Section 4.18 (the "Restrictive Covenants"),
Buyer shall have the right and remedy to have the Restrictive Covenants
specifically enforced against Seller and LivingSocial by any court of
competent jurisdiction, including immediate temporary injunctive relief in
accordance with applicable Law, it being agreed that any breach or threatened
breach of the Restrictive Covenants would cause irreparable injury to Buyer
and that money damages would not provide an adequate remedy to Buyer, which
right and remedy is in addition to, and not in lieu of, any other rights and
remedies available to Buyer under law or in equity.

(g) Modification of Restrictive Covenants. If any court of competent
jurisdiction at any time deems the Restrictive Covenants, or any part hereof,
unenforceable because of the duration or geographical scope of such
provisions, the other provisions of this Section 4.18 will nevertheless stand
and to the full extent consistent with law continue in full force and effect,
and it is the intention and desire of the parties that the court treat any
provisions of this Agreement which are not fully enforceable as having been
modified to the extent deemed necessary by the court to render them reasonable
and enforceable, and that the court enforce them to such extent.

Section 4.19 Notification of Certain Matters. Each of LivingSocial and Seller,
on the one hand, and Buyer, on the other hand, shall give prompt notice to
each other of (a) the occurrence, or failure to occur, of any event or the
existence of any condition that has caused or would reasonably be expected to
cause any of its representations or warranties contained in this Agreement to
be untrue or inaccurate so as to cause any of the closing conditions not to be
satisfied and (b) any failure on its part to comply with or satisfy, in any
material respect, any covenant, condition or obligation to be complied with or
satisfied by it under this Agreement; provided, that, except to prevent a
Party from committing fraud, no such disclosure pursuant to clause (a) or (b)
shall be deemed to (1) amend or supplement the Disclosure Schedule, (2)
otherwise prevent or cure any misrepresentation, breach of warranty, or breach
of covenant or obligation, or (3) limit or otherwise affect any remedies
available to the Party receiving such notice; provided, further, that if any
fact or matter disclosed pursuant to clause (a) or (b) would result in the
failure of condition in, as applicable, Section 5.1 or Section 5.2 to be
satisfied, and the affected Party elects to consummate 

the Closing notwithstanding the existence of such fact or matter, such fact or
matter shall not be precluded from forming the basis for any claim for
indemnification under Article VII.

Section 4.20 Deletion/Destruction of Seller Confidential Information. Promptly
following the Closing, but no later than sixty (60) days following the
Closing, the Company and its Subsidiaries will use commercially reasonable
efforts to delete or destroy all Seller Confidential Information from all
books and records retained by the Company and its Subsidiaries, including all
books and records in electronic form, including databases, Salesforce.com,
e‑mails and backups retained for archival and disaster recovery purposes;
provided, however, that the Company and its Subsidiaries shall first ensure
that it has delivered all such Seller Confidential Information to Seller. As
part of this process, the Company shall inform all directors, officers,
employees, agents and independent contractors to delete such Seller
Confidential Information from their respective desktops, notebooks, files or
databases maintained by such employees. Upon Seller's request, the Company
shall certify to Seller that it has and continues to comply with this Section
4.19. Promptly following the Closing, but no later than sixty (60) days

the related audited consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive

The unaudited consolidated financial statements of LS Korea as of September 

30, 2013 and for the periods ended September 30, 2013 and 2012, respectively,
shall have been reviewed by the independent public accounting firm that
audited the consolidated financial statements as of December 31, 2012 and 2011
and for the three-year period ended December 31, 2012.

preparation of the LS Korea Financial Statements pursuant to Section
4.21(a)(i) above, subject to Parent's receipt of reasonable documentation

(b) For the avoidance of doubt, the Parties expect that the SEC reporting
rules will require that the financial statements for periods prior to the
acquisition of the Company by LS Korea shall reflect the results of operations
of the Company, the predecessor entity to LS Korea for SEC financial statement
reporting purposes.

(c) Beginning on the Effective Date and from time to time until the Closing,

Section 7.1 Indemnification by Seller and LivingSocial. Each of Seller and
LivingSocial, jointly and severally, will indemnify and hold harmless Buyer
and its directors, officers, stockholders, employees, agents, subsidiaries and
affiliates (the "Buyer Indemnified Persons"), and will reimburse Buyer
Indemnified Persons for, any loss, liability, claim, damage or expense,
including reasonable out‑of‑pocket costs of investigation and defense of
claims and reasonable attorneys' fees and expenses, (collectively, "Losses")

(c) any claim in connection with Item 1 set forth on Section 7.1 of the
Disclosure Schedule;

the Disclosure Schedule (provided that the provisions of Section 7.6 are

(e) any payments in connection with Item 2 set forth on Section 7.1 of the
Disclosure Schedule.

All claims for indemnification under this Section 7.1 shall be administered by

jointly and severally, will indemnify and hold harmless Seller and its
directors, officers, stockholders, employees, agents, subsidiaries and
affiliates (collectively, the "Seller Indemnified Persons") and will reimburse

Indemnified Persons resulting from with any of the following:

(a) any breach of any representation or warranty made by Buyer in Section 3.2
of this Agreement; or

(b) any breach of any covenant or agreement of Buyer herein.

Section 7.3 Indemnification Limitation - Deductible. Seller and LivingSocial
shall have no obligation to indemnify Buyer Indemnified Persons under Section
7.1(a) and for claims brought against Seller or LivingSocial that arise under
Section 7.1(a), and no indemnification claims shall be brought against Seller
or LivingSocial until the aggregate amount of Losses incurred by 

Buyer Indemnified Persons, exceeds $1,300,000 (the "Indemnification
Deductible"), at which point Seller and LivingSocial will be obligated to
indemnify Buyer Indemnified Persons from and against all Losses incurred by
such Buyer Indemnified Persons in excess of the Indemnification Deductible;
provided, however, that the Indemnification Deductible shall not apply to
Losses arising under or resulting from common law fraud or breaches of the

Representations, common law fraud or claims pursuant to Sections 7.1(b)
through 7.1(e), the Buyer Indemnified Persons shall first seek recourse from

Fundamental Representation, claims pursuant to Sections 7.1(b) through 7.1(e),
or common law fraud, then directly to Seller or LivingSocial.

Section 7.5 Escrows; Distribution from Indemnity Escrow.

(a) Indemnity Escrow. To secure Seller's and LivingSocial's performance of
their indemnity obligations under this Article VII, on the Closing Date, Buyer
shall deposit the Escrow Amount into an escrow account (the "Escrow Fund")
established with J.P. Morgan Trust Company, National Association (the "Escrow
Agent") in accordance with the terms and conditions of the Escrow Agreement to
be entered into between Buyer, Seller and the Escrow Agent (the "Escrow
Agreement"). The Escrow Agreement shall have a term lasting the duration of

Escrow Agent under the Escrow Agreement shall be borne by Buyer.

(b) Distributions from Escrow Fund. If it is determined under the terms of
this Agreement or by mutual written agreement of Buyer and Seller that Seller
or LivingSocial has an obligation to indemnify a Buyer Indemnified Person for
a claim pursuant to 

Section 7.1, then such Buyer Indemnified Person shall make such claim (i)
first against the Escrow Fund in accordance with the terms and conditions of
the Escrow Agreement and any Losses for which such Buyer Indemnified Person is
entitled to indemnification shall be recovered or paid from the Escrow Fund
for the amount of such claim in accordance with the terms of the Escrow
Agreement until such Losses are paid or until the Escrow Fund has been
depleted and (ii) only with respect to any claim for breach of any Fundamental
Representation, claims pursuant to Sections 7.1(b) through 7.1(e) or common
law fraud, second against Seller or LivingSocial directly once the Escrow Fund
has been depleted.

Section 7.6 Indemnification Procedures.

(a) An indemnified party hereunder (the "Claiming Party") shall give the
indemnifying party ("Indemnifying Party") prompt written notice of any claim
of a third party (a "Third Party Claim") as to which the Claiming Party
proposes to demand indemnification hereunder, within twenty (20) days after
learning of such Third Party Claim (or within such shorter time as may be
necessary to give the Indemnifying Party a reasonable opportunity to respond
to such claim), together with a statement setting forth in reasonable detail
the nature and basis of such Third Party Claim and providing copies of the
relevant documents evidencing such Third Party Claim, the amount of the claim,
and the basis for the indemnification sought. The Third Party Claim Notice
shall (A) describe the claim in reasonable detail, and (B) indicate the amount
(estimated, if necessary, and to the extent feasible) of the Losses that have
been or reasonably may be suffered by the Claiming Party with respect to such
Third Party Claims. The failure to give a Third Party Claim Notice to the
Indemnifying Party shall not relieve the Indemnifying Party of any liability
hereunder unless the Indemnifying Party was prejudiced thereby under this
Article VII, and then only to the extent of such prejudice. The Indemnifying
Party must provide written notice to the Claiming Party that it is either (x)
assuming responsibility for the Third Party Claim, or (y) disputing the claim
for indemnification against it (such notice, the "Indemnification Notice").
The Indemnification Notice must be provided by the Indemnifying Party to the
Claiming Party within forty‑five (45) days after receipt of the notice from
the Claiming Party of the Third Party Claim (such period is referred to herein
as the "Indemnification Notice Period").

(b) If the Indemnifying Party provides an Indemnification Notice to the
Claiming Party within the Indemnification Notice Period that it assumes
responsibility for the Third Party Claim, the Indemnifying Party shall have
the right to assume and conduct the defense of such Third Party Claim at its
own expense; provided, however, that the Claiming Party will be allowed a
reasonable opportunity to participate in the defense of such Third Party Claim
with its own counsel and at its own expense. In the event the Indemnifying
Party assumes and conducts the defense on behalf of the Claiming Party, the
Indemnifying Party may settle such Third Party Claim, but shall not, without
the consent of the Claiming Party (which consent shall not be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned or delayed), agree to any settlement that does not
include a provision whereby the plaintiff or claimant in the matter releases
the Claiming Party from all liability with respect thereto or agree to any
relief other than money damages (and a full release related thereto). If the
Indemnifying Party does not 

assume the defense of such Third Party Claim in the manner provided above and
does not dispute the claim for indemnification against it, or if after
commencing or undertaking any such defense, fails to prosecute diligently or
withdraws from such defense, the Claiming Party shall have the right to
undertake the defense or settlement thereof, and the Claiming Party may defend
against, or enter into any settlement with respect to, the Third Party Claim
in any manner the Claiming Party reasonably may deem appropriate and
reasonable; provided, that any such settlement of such Third Party Claim must
include a provision whereby the plaintiff or claimant in the matter releases
the Claiming Party and the Indemnifying Party from all liability with respect
thereto; provided further that any settlement or resolution of a Third Party
Claim made without the prior written consent of Seller shall not be
determinative of the existence of or amount of indemnifiable Losses relating
to such matter; and provided, further, that the Indemnifying Party will be
allowed a reasonable opportunity to participate in the defense of such Third
Party Claim with its own counsel and at its own expense. In the event that (x)
a final judgment or order in favor of such third party in respect of such
Third Party Claim is rendered against the Claiming Party, that is not subject
to appeal or with respect to which the time to appeal has expired without an
appeal having been made, or (y) such Third Party Claim is settled in
accordance with this Section 7.6, resulting in liability on the part of the
Claiming Party, then subject to the limitations set forth in Sections 7.3,
7.4, and 7.5, the Indemnifying Party shall pay the amount of such Losses
(which payment, in the case of indemnification by Seller, shall be made by the
Escrow Agent's transfer to Buyer of a portion of the Escrow Fund equal to such
Losses).

(c) In the event that the Indemnifying Party disputes the claim for
indemnification against it with respect to such Third Party Claim, the
Claiming Party shall have the right to conduct the defense and to compromise
and settle such Third Party Claim in any manner the Claiming Party may deem
reasonably appropriate; provided that the Claiming Party shall not, without
the consent of the Indemnifying Party, agree to any settlement that does not
include a provision whereby the plaintiff or claimant of such Third Party
Claim releases the Indemnifying Party from all liability with respect to such
Third Party Claim; and provided further that any settlement or resolution of a
Third Party Claim made without the prior written consent of Seller shall not
be determinative of the existence of or amount of indemnifiable Losses
relating to such matter. If such dispute regarding the indemnification
obligation of the Indemnifying Party with respect to such Third Party Claim
has been finally resolved by a court or other tribunal of competent
jurisdiction, or by mutual agreement of the Claiming Party and Indemnifying
Party, to provide for indemnification by the Indemnifying Party of such Third
Party Claim, subject to the provisions of Sections 7.3, 7.4, and 7.5, the
Indemnifying Party shall within ten (10) Business Days of the date of such
resolution or agreement, pay to the Claiming Party all Losses paid or incurred
by the Claiming Party in connection therewith (which payment, in the case of
indemnification by Seller, shall be made by the Escrow Agent's transfer to
Buyer of a portion of the Escrow Fund in an amount equal to such Losses).

(d) In the event any Claiming Party should have a claim against any
Indemnifying Party for indemnification of Losses hereunder other than in
connection with a Third Party 

Claim, such Claiming Party shall deliver prompt notice of such claim to the
Indemnifying Party within twenty (20) days after learning of such claim (or
within such shorter time as may be necessary to give the Indemnifying Party a
reasonable opportunity to respond to such claim) stating in reasonable detail
the nature and basis of such claim and providing copies of the relevant
documents evidencing such claim, the amount of the claim, and the basis for
the indemnification sought. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the failure of the
Claiming Party to give such notice to the Indemnifying Party shall not relieve
the Indemnifying Party of any liability hereunder unless the Indemnifying
Party was prejudiced thereby under this Article VII, and then only to the
extent of such prejudice If the Indemnifying Party notifies the Claiming Party
that it does not dispute the claim described in such notice or fails to notify
the Claiming Party within thirty (30) days after delivery of such notice by
the Claiming Party whether the Indemnifying Party disputes the claim described
in such notice, the Loss in the amount specified in the Claiming Party's
notice shall be conclusively deemed a liability of the Indemnifying Party and,
subject to the limitations set forth in this Article VII, as applicable, Buyer
shall pay the amount of such Loss to the Seller Indemnified Persons on demand,
or the Escrow Agent shall cause the transfer to Buyer of a portion of the
Escrow Fund equal to the Loss incurred by Buyer Indemnified Persons, as
applicable. If the Indemnifying Party has timely disputed its liability with
respect to such claim, the dispute shall be resolved by mutual agreement of
the Claiming Party and Indemnifying Party, or in the absence of such
agreement, by a court or other tribunal of competent jurisdiction.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, as applicable,
Buyer shall pay the Seller Indemnified Persons, or the Escrow Agent on behalf
of Seller shall transfer to Buyer a portion of the Escrow Fund having a value
equal to, the amount of any such Loss no later than ten (10) Business Days
following the determination of the Indemnifying Party's liability (whether
such determination is made pursuant to the procedures set forth in this
Section 7.6(d), by agreement between the Indemnifying Party and the Claiming
Party or by final adjudication).

(e) Any indemnity payment due and payable by an Indemnifying Party under this
Agreement shall be net of any insurance proceeds or third party recoveries
with respect to such Losses actually received by a Claiming Party or its
Affiliates. If the indemnity amount is paid prior to the Claiming Party's
actual receipt of insurance proceeds or third party recoveries related
thereto, and a Claiming Party subsequently receives such insurance proceeds or
third party recoveries, then the Claiming Party shall promptly notify and pay
to the Indemnifying Party the amount of insurance proceeds subsequently
received. The Claiming Party agrees to use commercially reasonable efforts to
pursue any claims for insurance with respect to the claims or Losses for which
it is seeking indemnification hereunder. Except as otherwise provided in this
Section 7.6(e), the existence of any insurance policies shall not affect the
indemnification obligations of Seller.

(f) Any indemnity payment due and payable by an Indemnifying Party under this
Agreement shall be reduced by the Tax benefits actually realized by a Claiming
Party or its Affiliates, in respect of such Loss (the "Tax Benefits"). For
purposes of determining Tax Benefits, a Claiming Party shall be deemed to have
"actually realized" a Tax benefit to the extent that the amount of Taxes
payable by the Claiming Party as shown on such Claiming 

Party's Tax Return for the year in which the Loss is incurred or indemnity
payment is made, is reduced below the amount of Taxes that the Claiming Party
would have been required to pay but for the deduction attributable to the
incurrence or payment of such Loss.

Section 7.7 Consequential Damages. Notwithstanding anything else herein to the
contrary, in no event shall any Indemnifying Party be liable to any Claiming
Party hereunder for any unforeseeable, consequential or punitive damages,
except in the case of any such damages that are payable to a third party in
respect of a Third Party Claim that gives rise to indemnification payment
obligations in accordance with the terms hereunder.

Section 7.8 Computation of Losses. Solely for purposes of calculating the
dollar amount of any Losses suffered by a Buyer Indemnified Person pursuant to
a breach of a representation or warranty under Section 3.1, each
representation or warranty that contains any qualification as to "materiality"
or "Material Adverse Effect" shall be deemed to have been given as though
there were no such qualification, and any such qualification shall be
disregarded for purposes of this Article VII.

Section 7.9 Exclusive Remedy. Except with respect to any Loss that is the
result of common law fraud on the part of the other Party or any of its
Affiliates, each of the Parties hereto agrees that from and after the Closing,
its sole and exclusive remedy with respect to any and all claims relating to
breaches of covenants, representations and warranties of this Agreement shall
be indemnification pursuant to this Article VII; provided, however, that
nothing in this provision shall limit any equitable remedy, including
injunctions and specific performance, that a Party may have pursuant to this
Agreement.

Section 7.10 Duplication of Recovery. Any Loss for which any Party is entitled
to indemnification under Article VII shall be determined without duplication
of recovery by reason of the state of facts giving rise to such Loss
constituting a breach of more than one representation, warranty, covenant or
agreement; provided, however, that the right to indemnification shall not be
limited to the extent that the amount of Losses for such state of facts has
not previously been recovered. For the avoidance of doubt, any liability
included in the calculation of Working Capital shall not constitute a Loss
under this Agreement.

Section 7.11 Subrogation. Upon making any indemnification payment under this
Article VII, the Indemnifying Party will, to the extent of such payment, be
subrogated to all rights of the Claiming Party against any third party in
respect of the Losses to which such payment relates.

Section 7.12 Tax Indemnification.

(a) In addition to the indemnification obligations set forth in Section 7.1
above, each of Seller and LivingSocial, jointly and severally, will absolutely
and unconditionally indemnify and hold harmless the Buyer Indemnified Persons
from any and all Pre-Closing Taxes and any Korean CGT, without duplication of
any claim for indemnification for a breach of a representation or warranty
contained in Section 3.1(1), in each case, together with any reasonable costs
paid to experts and advisors in connection with such Pre-Closing Taxes and any
Korean CGT, any interest, penalties and additions to Tax with respect to any
of the foregoing, and any Losses incurred in connection with any of the
foregoing. It is 

expressly understood and agreed that the Buyer Indemnified Persons shall have
no obligation whatsoever to mitigate any Pre-Closing Taxes and any Korean CGT.

(b) An indemnity payment otherwise due and payable by Seller, LS Korea, the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries pursuant to this Section 7.12, or Section
7.1(a) in so much as it relates to a breach of a representation or warranty
contained in Section 3.1(l), shall be determined on a net basis after the
application (without duplication) of any Tax Attributes of LS Korea, the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries, as the case may be, which would have
actually been available to offset or reduce such Tax liability if the
assessment of and the payment of such Tax liability had been timely made in
the applicable Pre-Closing Tax Year by Seller, LS Korea, the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries. For the avoidance of doubt, Tax Attributes and application
of Tax Attributes shall be determined on an entity by entity basis to the
extent required under applicable Law.

(c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, no Buyer Indemnified
Persons will be limited in their indemnification rights as described pursuant
to this Section 7.12 as a result of (i) any failure or delay to provide notice
of a Tax Contest Claim to Seller, LS Korea, the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries unless Seller, LS Korea, the Company or any such Subsidiary was
prejudiced thereby under this Article VII, and then only to the extent of such
prejudice or (ii) as a result of any actions taken, or failure to take any
action or provide notice, in connection with Taxes or the imposition of Taxes,
interest, penalties or additions to Taxes other than as a result of a breach
of a covenant by the Buyer Indemnified Persons with respect to Tax matters. No
Seller Indemnified Person shall object to, or raise as a defense to the
indemnification provided for herein, any argument that any Buyer Indemnified
Person took any action, or failed to take any action, which resulted in the
imposition of Taxes or penalties that would not have otherwise been imposed
other than as a result of a breach of a covenant by the Buyer Indemnified
Persons with respect to Tax matters. The indemnification obligation of the
Seller Indemnified Persons under this Section 7.12 shall be binding upon
LivingSocial and its successors and assigns (including any successor to the
business or assets of LivingSocial, whether by merger, stock sale, asset
purchase or otherwise), and shall not be subject to any counterclaim, setoff,
deduction or defense based upon any claim any Seller Indemnified Person may
have against any Buyer Indemnified Person hereunder or otherwise.

(d) Buyer shall notify the Seller Indemnified Persons of the payment by Buyer,
LS Korea, the Company or its Subsidiaries of amounts that are the
responsibility of the Seller Indemnified Persons, and the Seller Indemnified
Persons under this Section 7.12, shall reimburse Buyer for any such Taxes or
Losses within fifteen (15) Business Days after delivery of such notice;
provided, that Buyer may, at its option, recover the amount of any such
amounts (or any portion thereof) from the Escrow Fund (in which case Buyer
shall specify in the notice delivered pursuant to this sentence the amount due
under this Section 7.12 to be set off against and deducted from the Escrow
Fund, if any). 

Section 7.13 Purchase Price Adjustment. All indemnification payments made
hereunder will be treated by all Parties as adjustments to the Purchase Price.

ARTICLE VIII

TERMINATION PRIOR TO THE CLOSING

Section 8.1 Termination of Agreement. This Agreement may be terminated at any
time prior to the Closing:

(a) by Seller or Buyer in writing, if any Requirement of Law shall be in
effect which has the effect of prohibiting or restraining such Parties or
Party from consummating the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and
the Parties or Party seeking to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this

the failure of the Closing to occur on or before such date; provided further,
that the Termination Date shall be extended by up to sixty (60) days from the

in any such case such breach shall be incapable of being cured or, if capable
of being cured, shall not have been cured on or prior to the earlier of (x)
the Termination Date and (y) the twentieth (20th) calendar day following
receipt of written notice thereof by the Party alleged to be in breach;
provided, however, that the right to terminate this Agreement under this
Section 8.1(e) shall not be available to a Party who shall then be in breach
of this Agreement, which breach would result in the failure to satisfy any
condition set forth in Section 5.1 or Section 5.2; or

(f) by mutual written consent of Seller and Buyer.

Section 8.2 Effect of Termination; Survival. In the event of termination of
this 

Agreement as provided in this Article VIII:

provisions, survives the termination of this Agreement, or the survival of
which is necessary to fulfill the intended effect of any other Section which,
by its express provisions, survive the termination of this Agreement and (ii)
that nothing herein shall relieve any Party from liability for any willful or
intentional breach of this Agreement prior to its termination; and

(b) all filings, applications and other submissions made pursuant to the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement shall, to the extent practicable,
be withdrawn from the Governmental Entity or other Person to which made.

may, to the extent permitted under any applicable Requirement of Law, (a)
extend the time for the performance of any of the obligations of the other
Parties or Party hereto, (b) waive any inaccuracies in the representations and
warranties made to such Party contained herein or in any document delivered
pursuant hereto, and (c) waive compliance with any of the covenants,
agreements or conditions for the benefit of such Party contained herein. Any
agreement on the part of a Party hereto to any such extension or waiver shall
be valid only if set forth in an instrument in writing signed on behalf of
such Party.

Article, Section, Schedule, or Disclosure Schedule, such reference shall be to
an Article of, a Section of, or a Schedule or Disclosure Schedule to, this

(a) This Agreement (including all exhibits and schedules hereto, and the
Disclosure Schedule), together with the other Transaction Agreements,
constitutes the entire agreement of the Parties with respect to the subject
matter contained herein and therein, and supersedes all prior agreements,
understandings, representations and warranties, both 

written and oral, among the Parties with respect to such subject matter.

(b) Except as otherwise provided in Article VII with respect to the
Indemnified Parties, the terms and provisions of this Agreement are intended
solely for the benefit of the Parties, and their respective successors and
assigns, and nothing in this Agreement is intended or shall be construed to
give any other Person any legal or equitable right, remedy or claim under, or
in respect of, this Agreement or any provision contained herein.

Section 9.5 Governing Law; Submission to Jurisdiction; Waiver of Jury Trial.
THIS AGREEMENT SHALL BE GOVERNED BY AND CONSTRUED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE LAWS
OF THE STATE OF DELAWARE, WITHOUT REGARD TO THE CONFLICTS OF LAWS RULES
THEREOF. The parties hereby agree and consent to be subject to the exclusive
jurisdiction of the United States District Court for the District of Delaware,
and in the absence of such federal jurisdiction, the parties consent to be
subject to the exclusive jurisdiction of the state courts located in
Wilmington, Delaware, and hereby waive the right to assert the lack of
personal or subject matter jurisdiction or improper venue in connection with
any such suit, action or other proceeding. In furtherance of the foregoing,
each of the parties (a) waives the defense of inconvenient forum, (b) agrees
not to commence any suit, action or other proceeding arising out of any
Transaction Agreement or any transactions contemplated hereby or thereby other
than in any such court, and (c) agrees that a final judgment in any such suit,
action or other proceeding shall be conclusive and may be enforced in other
jurisdictions by suit or judgment or in any other manner provided by Law. EACH
PARTY HERETO HEREBY IRREVOCABLY WAIVES ANY AND ALL RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY IN
ANY LEGAL PROCEEDING ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT OR THE
TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY.

Section 9.6 Assignment. Neither this Agreement nor any of the rights,
interests or obligations of any Party shall be assigned, in whole or in part,
by operation of law or otherwise by such Party without the prior written
consent of the other Parties, and any such assignment that is not consented to
shall be null and void; provided, however, that Buyer may, as long as such
actions do not cause an adverse effect for Seller or any of its Affiliates and
other than any obligations of Buyer or Parent with respect to Section 2.2(d)
or any obligation to cause a Registration Statement to become effective
pursuant to Section 4.15 or otherwise pursuant to this Agreement, (a) assign
any or all of its rights and interests hereunder to one or more of its
Affiliates and (b) designate one or more of its Affiliates to perform its
obligations hereunder (in any or all of which cases Buyer nonetheless shall
remain responsible for the performance of all of its obligations hereunder).
Subject to the preceding sentence, this Agreement will be binding upon, inure
to the benefit of, and be enforceable by, the Parties and their respective
successors and permitted assigns.

Section 9.7 Disclosure Schedule. The Disclosure Schedule will be arranged in
sections corresponding to the numbered and lettered sections of Section 3.1 to
which exceptions to the representations and warranties set forth in Section
3.1 relate and which exceptions shall be deemed to be representations and
warranties as if made under this Agreement. Exceptions to any representations
or warranties disclosed in one section of the Disclosure Schedule shall
constitute an exception to any other representations or warranties made in
this Agreement only to the extent that the exception's relevance or
applicability to information called for by such other Section or 

Sections is reasonably apparent on its face from a plain reading of the text
or information disclosed (without reference to any document(s) disclosed
therein or further inquiry that such disclosure would qualify other Section or
Sections), notwithstanding the omission of a reference or cross reference
thereto.

Section 9.8 Specific Performance. The Parties agree that irreparable damage
would occur in the event any of the provisions of this Agreement were not
performed in accordance with the terms hereof and that, prior to the
termination of this Agreement pursuant to Section 8.1, the Parties shall be
entitled to an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement
by the other Parties or to specific performance of the terms hereof in
addition to any other remedies at Law or in equity.

Section 9.9 Severability. Whenever possible, each provision or portion of any
provision of this Agreement will be interpreted in such manner as to be
effective and valid under applicable Requirements of Law, but if any provision
or portion of any provision of this Agreement is held to be invalid, illegal
or unenforceable in any respect under any applicable Requirements of Law, such
invalidity, illegality or unenforceability will not affect any other provision
or portion of any provision in such jurisdiction, and this Agreement will be
reformed, construed and enforced in such jurisdiction as if such invalid,
illegal or unenforceable provision or portion of any provision had never been
contained herein.

Section 9.10 Amendment; Modification and Waiver. This Agreement may be
amended, superseded, cancelled, renewed or extended, and the terms hereof may
be waived, only by a written instrument signed by each of the Parties or, in
the case of a waiver, by the Party waiving compliance. No delay on the part of
any Party in exercising any right, power or privilege hereunder shall operate
as a waiver thereof, nor shall any waiver on the part of any Party of any
right, power or privilege, nor any single or partial exercise of any such
right, power or privilege, preclude any further exercise thereof or the
exercise of any other such right, power or privilege.

Section 9.11 Counterparts. This Agreement may be executed in one or more
counterparts, all of which shall be considered one and the same instrument and
shall become effective when one or more counterparts have been signed by each
Party and delivered to the other Parties. Each counterpart may be delivered by
facsimile transmission or e‑mail (as a .pdf, .tif or similar uneditable
attachment), which transmission shall be deemed delivery of an originally
executed counterpart hereof.

APPLICABLE ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES



Ticketmonster, Inc.

2013 Working Capital Accounting Policies



Note: All the of the following accounting policies conform to US GAAP and in
the absence of clarity US Generally Accepted Accounting policies should apply.



CURRENT ASSETS

Cash and Cash Equivalents

The Company considers all highly liquid investments with original maturities
of three months or less to be cash equivalents. The cash and cash equivalents
balances consist of cash deposited in institutional money market mutual funds
and regular interest bearing and noninterest bearing depository accounts with
commercial banks.

Accounts Receivable

Accounts receivable primarily represents the net cash due from the Company\'s
credit card and other payment processors for cleared transactions as well as
cash due from merchants. When necessary, the carrying amount of the Company\'s
receivables is reduced by an allowance for doubtful accounts that reflects
management\'s best estimate of amounts that will not be collected. The
allowance is based on historical loss experience and any specific risks
identified in collection matters.

Prepaid Assets

Prepaid assets represent amounts paid in advance to primarily merchants and
vendors for goods and services to be received in the near future.

CURRENT LIABILITIES

Accrued Expenses

The Company's accrued expenses include loyalty programs, refunds, accrued
compensation and benefits, and accrued professional fees and other.

Accrued Loyalty Awards Reserve

The Company's loyalty programs allow its subscribers to earn credits that can
be redeemed for future purchases of deals. Subscriber credits are provided to
existing subscribers for performing qualifying acts. A qualifying act is when
a subscriber performs an action, such as providing the Company a new
subscriber referral, and the subscriber is made aware of the credits prior to
the performance of the action. Upon issuance of the subscriber credits
following a qualifying act, the value of subscriber credits is recorded to
marketing expense. Unredeemed subscriber credits are recorded at the Company's
ultimate cost of such credits in accrued liabilities. The cost of 

expired credits is reversed against the initial marketing expense in the
period of expiration. The Company also issues promotional credits in
subscriber acquisition and other marketing campaigns, where the recipient of
the credits is not required to perform any qualifying acts. Upon redemption,
the value of promotional credits is recorded as marketing expense.

Accrued Refunds

At the time revenue is recorded, the Company records an accrual for estimated
refunds primarily based on the Company's historical experience with refunds.
Refunds are recorded as a reduction of revenue. The liability for refunds is
adjusted as appropriate as actual refund activity occurs. The Company
routinely evaluates its assumptions used to estimate its subscriber refund
accrual based on developments in refund and expiration patterns, subscriber
contract changes, and other factors.

Accrued Compensation and Benefits

Accrued compensation and benefits includes accruals for salaries, annual
leave, and corporate bonus. The Company's employees are eligible for the
Seller's corporate bonus plan. The Seller's corporate bonus plan is funded
based on the 2013 financial performance at both the local level and total
company level and is adjusted at the discretion of the LivingSocial Board.
This bonus pool is allocated to employees based on individual targets and
performance, and the anticipated payout is adjusted each quarter based on
actual results versus the target. The bonus plan is funded based on a mix of
total corporate (20%) and local (80%) performance, split 50% / 50% between
hitting Gross Profit and OEBITDA and Corporate Bonus Accrual targets. The
parties agreed for purposes of the calculation of the Estimated Working
Capital and the Actual Working Capital that the amount will remain fixed at
2,027,086,837 KRW for the Closing Date calculations.

The Company accrues a liability related to its annual paid leave policy over
the period the employee renders the service that entitles the employee to
future annual paid leave.

Deferred Revenue

Any cash payments received from revenue transactions are recorded as deferred
revenue until all of the following criteria have been met: persuasive evidence
of an arrangement exists; delivery has occurred; the selling price is fixed or
determinable; and collectability is reasonably assured. The Company's deferred
revenue balances include amounts from all types of revenue sources.
