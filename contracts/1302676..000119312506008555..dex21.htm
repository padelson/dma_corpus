Merger Sub shall be merged with and into the Company and the separate
corporate existence of Merger Sub shall thereupon cease. The Company shall be
the surviving corporation in the Merger (sometimes hereinafter referred to as

-2- ARTICLE III



_Officers and Directors_

_of the Surviving Corporation_



3.1. _Directors_. The parties hereto shall take all actions necessary so that
the board of directors of Merger Sub at the Effective Time shall, from and

their successors shall have been duly elected or appointed and qualified or
until their earlier death, resignation or removal in accordance with the
Articles and the By-Laws.



3.2. _Officers_. The parties hereto shall take all actions necessary so that
the officers of the Company at the Effective Time shall, from and after the
Effective Time, be the officers of the Surviving Corporation until their

ARTICLE IV



_Effect of the Merger on Capital Stock;_

_Exchange of Certificates_



4.1. _Effect on Capital Stock_. At the Effective Time, as a result of the
Merger and without any action on the part of the holder of any capital stock
of the Company:



(a) _Merger Consideration_. Each share of Common Stock, par value $0.02 per
share, of the Company (a " _ _Share__ " and collectively, the " _ _Shares__ ")
issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than (i)
Shares owned by Parent, Merger Sub or the Company, (ii) Shares owned by any
direct or indirect Subsidiary (as defined in Section 5.1(a)) of Parent (other
than Merger Sub), (iii) Shares owned by any direct or indirect wholly-owned
Subsidiary of the Company and (iv) Shares that are owned by Shareholders (" _
_Dissenting Shareholders__ ") who have perfected and not withdrawn a demand
for appraisal rights pursuant to Chapter 156D, §13.02 of the
Massachusetts General Laws (each, an " _ _Excluded Share__ " and
collectively, " _ _Excluded Shares__ ")) shall be converted into the right to
receive $47.75 per Share (the " _ _Per Share Merger Consideration__ "). At
the Effective Time, all of the Shares shall cease to be outstanding, shall be
cancelled and shall cease to exist, and each certificate (a " _ _Certificate__
") formerly representing any of the Shares (other than Excluded Shares) shall
thereafter represent only the right to receive the Per Share Merger
Consideration, without interest.



(b) _Cancellation of Shares_. Each Excluded Share referred to in clause
4.1(a)(i), (ii) or (iii) shall, by virtue of the Merger and without any
action on the  



 

-3-  part of the holder thereof, cease to be outstanding, shall be cancelled
without payment of any consideration therefor and shall cease to exist.

 



(c) _Merger Sub_. At the Effective Time, each share of common stock, par
value $0.01 per share, of Merger Sub issued and outstanding immediately prior
to the Effective Time shall be converted into one share of common stock, par
value $1.00 per share, of the Surviving Corporation.



4.2. _Exchange of Certificates_.



(a) _Paying Agent_. At the Effective Time, Parent shall deposit, or shall
cause to be deposited, with a paying agent selected by Parent with the
Companys prior approval, which shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed
(the " _ _Paying Agent__ "), for the benefit of the holders of Shares, a cash
amount in immediately available funds necessary for the Paying Agent to make
payments under Section 4.1(a) (such cash being hereinafter referred to as the
" _ _Exchange Fund__ "). The Paying Agent shall invest the Exchange Fund as
directed by Parent, _provided_ that such investments shall be in obligations
of or guaranteed by the United States of America, in commercial paper
obligations rated A-1 or P-1 or better by Moodys Investors Service, Inc.
or Standard and Poors Corporation, respectively, or in certificates of
deposit, bank repurchase agreements or bankers acceptances of commercial
banks with capital exceeding $1 billion. Any interest and other income
resulting from such investment in excess of the amounts payable under Section
4.1(a) shall be the property of Parent and shall be returned to Parent from
time to time.



(b) _Exchange Procedures_. Promptly after the Effective Time (and in any event
within three (3) Business Days), the Surviving Corporation shall cause the
Paying Agent to mail to each holder of record of Shares (other than holders of
Excluded Shares) (i) a letter of transmittal in customary form specifying that
delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the
Certificates shall pass, only upon delivery of the Certificates (or
affidavits of loss in lieu thereof as provided in Section 4.2(e)) to the
Paying Agent, such letter of transmittal to be in such form and have such
other provisions as Parent and the Company may reasonably agree, and (ii)
instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the Certificates (or
affidavits of loss in lieu thereof as provided in Section 4.2(e)) in exchange
for the aggregate amount of Per Share Merger Consideration represented by
such holders Certificates (after giving effect to any required tax
withholdings as provided in Section 4.2(g)). Upon surrender of a Certificate
(or affidavit of loss in lieu thereof as provided in Section 4.2(e)) to the
Paying Agent in accordance with the terms of such letter of transmittal, duly
executed, the holder of such Certificate shall be entitled to receive in
exchange therefor a cash amount in immediately available funds (after giving
effect to any required tax withholdings as provided in Section 4.2(g)) equal
to (x) the number of Shares represented by such Certificate (or affidavit of
loss in lieu thereof as provided in Section 4.2(e)) multiplied by (y) the Per
Share Merger Consideration, and the Certificate so surrendered shall
forthwith be cancelled. No interest will be paid or accrued on any amount
payable upon due surrender  



 

-4-  of the Certificates. In the event of a transfer of ownership of Shares that
is not registered in the transfer records of the Company, a check for any cash
to be exchanged upon due surrender of the Certificate may be issued to such
transferee if the Certificate formerly representing such Shares is presented
to the Paying Agent, accompanied by all documents required to evidence and
effect such transfer and to evidence that any applicable stock transfer taxes
have been paid.



(c) _Transfers_. From and after the Effective Time, there shall be no
transfers on the stock transfer books of the Company of Shares that were
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time. If, after the Effective
Time, any Certificate is presented to the Surviving Corporation, Parent or
the Paying Agent for transfer, it shall be cancelled and exchanged for the
cash amount in immediately available funds to which the holder thereof is
entitled pursuant to this Article IV.



(d) _Termination of Exchange Fund_. Any portion of the Exchange Fund
(including the proceeds of any investments thereof) that remains unclaimed by
the Shareholders of the Company for one year after the Effective Time shall be
delivered to the Surviving Corporation to be held in trust for the benefit of
the holders of Shares who have not yet then complied with Article IV. Any
holder of Shares (other than Excluded Shares) who has not theretofore complied
with this Article IV shall thereafter look only to the Surviving
Corporation for payment of the aggregate amount of Per Share Merger
Consideration (after giving effect to any required tax withholdings as
provided in Section 4.2(g)) upon due surrender of its Certificates (or
affidavits of loss in lieu thereof), without any interest thereon.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, none of the Surviving Corporation, Parent, the
Paying Agent or any other Person shall be liable to any former holder of
Shares for any amount properly delivered to a public official pursuant
to applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar Laws. For the purposes
of this Agreement, the term " _ _Person__ " shall mean any individual,
corporation (including not-for-profit), general or limited partnership,
limited liability company, joint venture, estate, trust, association,
organization, Governmental Entity (as defined in Section 5.1(d)) or other
entity of any kind or nature.



(e) _Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates_. In the event any Certificate
shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of
that fact by the Person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or
destroyed and, if required by Parent, the posting by such Person of a bond in
customary amount and upon such terms as may be required by Parent as
indemnity against any claim that may be made against it or the Surviving
Corporation with respect to such Certificate, the Paying Agent will issue a
check in the amount (after giving effect to any required tax withholdings as
provided in Section 4.2(g)) equal to the number of Shares represented by such
lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate multiplied by the Per Share Merger
Consideration.



 

(f) _Appraisal Rights_. No Person who has perfected a demand for appraisal
rights pursuant to Chapter 156D, §13.02 of the Massachusetts General Laws
shall be entitled to receive the Per Share Merger Consideration with respect
to the Shares  



 

-5-  owned by such Person unless and until such Person shall have effectively
withdrawn or lost such Persons right to appraisal under the MBCA.
Each Dissenting Shareholder shall be entitled to receive only the payment
provided by Chapter 156D, §13.02 of the Massachusetts General Laws with
respect to Shares owned by such Dissenting Shareholder. The Company shall give
Parent (i) prompt notice of any written demands for appraisal, attempted
withdrawals of such demands, and any other instruments served pursuant to
applicable law that are received by the Company relating to shareholders
rights of appraisal and (ii) the opportunity to direct all negotiations and
proceedings with respect to demand for appraisal under the MBCA. The Company
shall not, except with the prior written consent of Parent, voluntarily make
any payment with respect to any demands for appraisal, offer to settle or
settle any such demands or approve any withdrawal of any such demands.



(g) _Withholding Rights_. Each of Parent, the Surviving Corporation and the
Paying Agent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the consideration
otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement to any holder of Shares such
amounts as it is required to deduct and withhold with respect to the making of
such payment under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the " _
_Code__ "), or any other applicable state, local or foreign Tax (as defined in
Section 5.1(n)) law. To the extent that amounts are so withheld by the
Surviving Corporation, Parent or the Paying Agent, as the case may be, such
withheld amounts (i) shall be remitted by Parent or the Surviving Corporation
or the Paying Agent, as applicable, to the applicable Governmental Entity, and
(ii) shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been
paid to the holder of Shares in respect of which such deduction and
withholding was made by the Surviving Corporation, Parent or the Paying Agent,
as the case may be.



4.3. _Treatment of Stock Plans_.



(a) _Treatment of Options_. At the Effective Time each outstanding option to
purchase Shares (a " _ _Company Option__ ") under the Stock Plans (as defined
in Section 5.1(b)), other than the 2005 Employee Stock Purchase Plan, vested
or unvested, shall be cancelled and shall only entitle the holder thereof to
receive from Parent, as soon as reasonably practicable after the Effective
Time (but in any event within ten Business Days), an amount in cash equal to
the product of (x) the total number of Shares subject to the Company Option
times (y) the excess, if any, of the Per Share Merger Consideration over the
exercise price per Share under such Company Option less applicable Taxes
required to be withheld with respect to such payment under the Code, or any
other applicable state, local or foreign Tax (as defined in Section 5.1(n))
law. To the extent that amounts are so withheld by the Surviving Corporation
or Parent, as the case may be, such withheld amounts (i) shall be remitted by
Parent or the Surviving Corporation, as applicable, to the applicable
Governmental Entity, and (ii) shall be treated for all purposes of this
Agreement as having been paid to the holder of Company Options in respect of
which such deduction and withholding was made by the Surviving Corporation
or Parent, as the case may be. All Company Options outstanding under the 2005
Employee Stock Purchase Plan as of the Effective Time shall be cancelled as of
the  



 

-6-  Effective Time, provided that notice of such cancellation shall be given to
each holder of a Company Option thereunder, and each holder of a Company
Option thereunder shall have the right to exercise such Option in full based
on payroll deductions then credited to his account as of a date determined by
the Board or the Committee, which date shall not be less than ten (10) days
preceding the Effective Time.



(b) _Company Awards_. At the Effective Time, each right of any kind,
contingent or accrued, to acquire or receive Shares or benefits measured by
the value of Shares, and each award of any kind consisting of Shares that may
be held, awarded, outstanding, payable or reserved for issuance under the
Stock Plans and any other Benefit Plans, other than Company Options (the " _
_Company Awards__ "), shall be cancelled and shall only entitle the holder
thereof to receive, as soon as reasonably practicable after the Effective
Time, an amount in cash equal to (x) the number of Shares subject to such
Company Award immediately prior to the Effective Time times (y) the Per Share
Merger Consideration (or, if the Company Award provides for payments to
the extent the value of the Shares exceed a specified reference price, the
amount, if any, by which the Per Share Merger Consideration exceeds such
reference price), less applicable Taxes required to be withheld with respect
to such payment under the Code, or any other applicable state, local or
foreign Tax (as defined in Section 5.1(n)) law. To the extent that amounts are
so withheld by the Surviving Corporation or Parent, as the case may be, such
withheld amounts (i) shall be remitted by Parent or the Surviving
Corporation, as applicable, to the applicable Governmental Entity, and (ii)
shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the
holder of Company Awards in respect of which such deduction and withholding
was made by the Surviving Corporation or Parent, as the case may be.



(c) _Corporate Actions_. At or prior to the Effective Time, the Company, the
board of directors of the Company and the compensation committee of the board
of directors of the Company, as applicable, shall adopt any resolutions and
take any actions which are necessary to effectuate the provisions of Section
4.3(a) and 4.3(b). The Company shall take all actions necessary to ensure that
from and after the Effective Time neither Parent nor the
Surviving Corporation will be required to deliver Shares or other capital
stock of the Company to any Person pursuant to or in settlement of Company
Options or Company Awards.



(d) _Notice_. As soon as practicable following the execution of this
Agreement, the Company shall mail to each person who is a holder of Company
Options or Company Awards a letter approved in advance by Parent describing
the treatment of and payment for such Company Options or Company Awards
pursuant to this Section 4.3 and providing instructions for use in obtaining
payment for such Company Options or Company Awards.



4.4. _Adjustments to Prevent Dilution_. In the event that the Company changes
the number of Shares or securities convertible or exchangeable into or
exercisable for Shares issued and outstanding prior to the Effective Time as a
result of a  



 

-7-  reclassification, stock split (including a reverse stock split), stock
dividend or distribution, recapitalization, merger, issuer tender or exchange
offer, or other similar transaction, the Per Share Merger Consideration shall
be equitably adjusted.



ARTICLE V



_Representations and Warranties_



5.1. _Representations and Warranties of the Company_. Except as set forth in
the Company Reports (as defined in Section 5.1(e)) filed with the Securities
and Exchange Commission (the " _ _SEC__ ") prior to the date hereof or in the
corresponding sections or subsections of the disclosure letter delivered to
Parent by the Company (provided that the disclosures shall qualify other
sections and subsections of the disclosure letter to the extent it is clearly
apparent (notwithstanding the absence of a specific cross-reference) that
such disclosure is clearly applicable to such other sections and subsections)
(the " _ _Company Disclosure Letter__ "), the Company hereby represents and
warrants to Parent and Merger Sub that: 



(a) _Organization, Good Standing and Qualification_. Each of the Company and
its Subsidiaries is a legal entity duly organized, validly existing and (to
the extent such concept is applicable) in good standing under the Laws (as
defined in Section 5.1(i)) of its respective jurisdiction of organization and
has all requisite corporate or similar power and authority to own, lease and
operate its properties and assets and to carry on its business as presently
conducted and is qualified to do business and is in good standing as a foreign
corporation or other legal entity in each jurisdiction where the ownership,
leasing or operation of its assets or properties or conduct of its business
requires such qualification, except where the failure to be so organized,
qualified or in good standing, or to have such power or authority, would not,
individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to result in a
Material Adverse Effect (as defined below). The Company has made available to
Parent correct and complete copies of the Companys and its Subsidiaries
articles of organization and by-laws or comparable governing documents, each
as amended to date, and each as so delivered is in full force and effect.
Section 5.1(a) of the Company Disclosure Letter contains a correct and
complete list of each jurisdiction where the Company and its Subsidiaries are
organized and qualified to do business. As used in this Agreement, the term
(i) " _ _Subsidiary__ " means, with respect to any Person, any other Person
of which at least a majority of the securities or ownership interests having
by their terms ordinary voting power to elect a majority of the board of
directors or other persons performing similar functions is directly
or indirectly owned or controlled by such Person and/or by one or more of its
Subsidiaries, (ii) " _ _Significant Subsidiary__ " is as defined in Rule
1.02(w) of Regulation S-X promulgated pursuant to the Securities Exchange Act
of 1934, as amended (the " _ _Exchange Act__ ") and (iii) " _ _Material
Adverse Effect__ " with respect to the Company means a material adverse effect
on the financial condition, properties, assets, liabilities, business or
results of  



 

-8-  operations of the Company and its Subsidiaries taken as a whole; _provided,
however_ , that none of the following, in and of itself or themselves,
shall constitute a Material Adverse Effect:



(A) changes in the economy or financial markets generally in the United
States or Canada;



(B) changes that are the result of acts of war, terrorism or natural
disasters, _provided_ that such acts do not directly affect the material
properties or assets of the Company and its Subsidiaries;



(C) changes in United States generally accepted accounting principles after
the date hereof;



(D) any loss of, or adverse change in, the relationship of the Company with
its customers, employees or suppliers that was directly or proximately caused
by the announcement, pendency or closing of the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement;



(E) any failure of the Company to meet any estimates, including revenues or
earnings, for any period ending on or after the date of this Agreement and
prior to the Closing; _provided_ that the exception in this clause shall not
prevent or otherwise affect a determination that any change, effect,
circumstance or development underlying such failure has resulted in, or
contributed to, a Material Adverse Effect;



(F) any action expressly required by this Agreement or taken pursuant to this
Agreement at the specific request of the Parent;



(G) any fees or expenses incurred in accordance with the terms of this
Agreement; and



(H) a decline in the price of the Shares on the NASDAQ National Market.



_provided, further_ , that with respect to clauses (A), (B) and (C), such
change, event, circumstance or development does not primarily relate only to
(or have the effect of primarily relating only to) the Company and its
Subsidiaries.



(b) _Capital Structure_.



(i) The authorized capital stock of the Company consists of 50,000,000 Shares,
of which 14,231,836 Shares were outstanding as of the date hereof, and
5,000,000 shares of preferred stock, $0.01 par value per share, of which
50,000 shares have been designated Series A Junior Participating Preferred
Stock and no shares of which are issued and outstanding. All of the
outstanding  



 

-9-  Shares have been duly authorized and are validly issued, fully paid and
nonassessable. Other than 2,116,789 Shares reserved for issuance under
the Companys 2005 Employee Stock Purchase Plan, 2000 Stock Option Plan, 1994
Stock Option Plan and 2000 Stock Incentive Plan (the " _ _Stock Plans__ "),
the Company has no Shares reserved for issuance. Section 5.1(b)(i) of the
Company Disclosure Letter contains a correct and complete list of options and
restricted stock under the Stock Plans, including the holder, date of grant,
term, number of Shares and exercise price and vesting schedule including
whether the vesting will be accelerated by the execution of this Agreement or
consummation of the Merger or by termination of employment or change of
position following consummation of the Merger. Each of the outstanding shares
of capital stock or other securities of each of the Companys Subsidiaries is
duly authorized, validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable and owned by the
Company or by a direct or indirect wholly-owned Subsidiary of the Company,
free and clear of any lien, charge, pledge, security interest, claim or other
encumbrance (each, a " _ _Lien__ "). Except as set forth above and except for
the rights (the " _ _Rights__ ") that have been issued pursuant to the Rights
Agreement, dated as of November 19, 2004, between the Company and Registrar
and Transfer Company (the " _ _Rights Agreement__ "), there are no preemptive
or other outstanding rights, options, warrants, conversion rights, stock
appreciation rights, redemption rights, repurchase rights, agreements,
arrangements, calls, commitments or rights of any kind that obligate the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries to issue or sell any shares of capital
stock or other securities of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or any
securities or obligations convertible or exchangeable into or exercisable for,
or giving any Person a right to subscribe for or acquire, any securities of
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, and no securities or obligations
evidencing such rights are authorized, issued or outstanding. Upon any
issuance of any Shares in accordance with the terms of the Stock Plans, such
Shares will be duly authorized, validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable
and free and clear of any Liens. The Company does not have outstanding any
bonds, debentures, notes or other obligations the holders of which have the
right to vote (or convertible into or exercisable for securities having the

(ii) Section 5.1(b)(ii) of the Company Disclosure Letter sets forth (x) each

obligations under this Agreement and to consummate the Merger, subject only to
adoption of this Agreement by the holders of two-thirds of the outstanding
Shares entitled to vote on such matter at a Shareholders meeting duly called
and held for such purpose (the " _ _Company Requisite Vote__ "). This
Agreement has been duly executed and delivered by the Company and constitutes

Recommendation__ "), (B) directed that this Agreement be submitted to the
holders of Shares for their adoption and (C) received the opinion of its
financial advisor, Signal Hill Capital Group LLC (" _ _Signal Hill Capital_

including but not limited to, any fiscal intermediary under contract with a
state Medicaid Agency (each a " _ _Governmental Entity__ "), in connection
with the execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement by the Company
and the consummation of the Merger and the other transactions contemplated
hereby, or in connection with the continuing operation of the business of the
Company and its Subsidiaries (as presently conducted) following the Effective
Time, except those that the failure to make or obtain are not,  



 

-11-  individually or in the aggregate, reasonably likely to have a Material
Adverse Effect or prevent, materially delay or materially impair the
consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.



(ii) The execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement by the Company
do not, and the consummation of the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated hereby will not, constitute or result in (A) a breach or
violation of, or a default under, the articles of organization or by-laws of
the Company or the comparable governing documents of any of its Subsidiaries,
(B) with or without notice, lapse of time or both, a breach or violation of, a
termination (or right of termination) or default under, the creation or
acceleration of any obligations under or the creation of a Lien on any of the
assets of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries pursuant to any agreement,
lease, license, contract, note, mortgage, indenture, arrangement or other
obligation (each, a _" _Contract__ ") binding upon the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries or, assuming (solely with respect to performance of this
Agreement and consummation of the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated hereby) compliance with the matters referred to in Section
5.1(d)(i), any Law to which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is subject,
or (C) any change in the rights or obligations of any party under any
Contract binding upon the Company or any of its Subsidiaries except, in the
case of clause (B) or (C) above, for any such breach, violation, termination,
default, creation, acceleration or change that is not, individually or in
the aggregate, reasonably likely to have a Material Adverse Effect or
prevent, materially delay or materially impair the consummation of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Section 5.1(d)(ii) of the Company
Disclosure Letter sets forth a correct and complete list of Material
Contracts (as defined in Section 5.1(j)(i)(K)) pursuant to which consents or
waivers are or may be required prior to consummation of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement (whether or not subject to the exception set
forth with respect to clauses (B) and (C) above).



(iii) Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries is a party to or bound
by any non-competition Contracts or other Contract that purports to limit in
any material respect either the type of business in which the Company or its

Subsidiaries) may engage or the manner or locations in which any of them may
so engage in any business.



(iv) To the knowledge of the Company, the Company and its Subsidiaries are
not creditors or claimants with respect to any debtors or debtor-in-possession
subject to proceedings under chapter 11 of title 11 of the United States Code

reasonably likely to adversely affect the Companys ability to record,
process, summarize and report financial information and has identified for the
Companys auditors and audit committee of the Companys board of directors any
material weaknesses in internal control over financial reporting and (B) any
fraud, whether or not material, that involves management or other employees
who have a significant role in the Companys internal control over financial
reporting. The Company has made available to Parent (i) a summary of any such
disclosure made by  



 

-13-  management to the Companys auditors and audit committee since the

attorney representing the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, whether or not
employed by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, has reported evidence of a
violation of securities laws, breach of fiduciary duty or similar violation
by the Company or any of its officers, directors, employees or agents to the
Companys board or any committee thereof, or to any of the Companys directors
or officers.



(iv) Each of the consolidated balance sheets included in or incorporated by
reference into the Company Reports (including the related notes and schedules)

filed after the date hereof, will fairly present in all material respects
the consolidated financial position of the Company and its consolidated
Subsidiaries as of its date and each of the consolidated statements of income,
changes in shareholders equity (deficit) and cash flows included in or
incorporated by reference into the Company Reports (including any related
notes and schedules) fairly presents, or in the case of Company Reports filed
after the date hereof, will fairly present the results of operations, retained
earnings (loss) and changes in financial position, as the case may be, of
such companies for the periods set forth therein (subject, in the case of
unaudited statements, to notes and normal year-end audit adjustments that will
not be material in amount or effect), in each case in accordance with GAAP
consistently applied during the periods involved, except as may be noted
therein.



(f) _Absence of Certain Changes_. Since December 31, 2004, the Company and its
Subsidiaries have conducted their respective businesses only in, and have not
engaged in any material transaction other than in accordance with, the
ordinary course of such businesses consistent with past practices and there
has not been:



(i) any change in the financial condition, properties, assets, liabilities,
business or results of their operations or any circumstance, occurrence or

-14-  the Company has knowledge which, individually or in the aggregate, is
reasonably likely to have a Material Adverse Effect;



(ii) any material damage, destruction or other casualty loss with respect to
any material asset or property owned, leased or otherwise used by the Company
or any of its Subsidiaries, whether or not covered by insurance;



 

(iii) any declaration, setting aside or payment of any dividend or other
distribution with respect to any shares of capital stock of the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries (except for dividends or other distributions by any
direct or indirect wholly-owned Subsidiary to the Company or to any wholly-
owned Subsidiary of the Company), or any repurchase, redemption or
other acquisition by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries of any
outstanding shares of capital stock or other securities of the Company or any
of its Subsidiaries, other than required repurchases of unvested shares
pursuant to the terms of restricted stock agreements with employees,
consultants or advisors of the Company;



(iv) except as required by GAAP, any material change in any method of
accounting or accounting practice by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries;



(v) (A) any increase in the compensation payable or to become payable to its
officers or employees (except for increases in the ordinary course of
business and consistent with past practice) or (B) any establishment,
adoption, entry into or amendment of any collective bargaining, bonus, profit
sharing, thrift, compensation, employment, termination, severance or other
plan, agreement, trust, fund, policy or arrangement for the benefit of any
director, officer or employee, except for any employment agreement with non-

(vi) any agreement to do any of the foregoing.



(g) _Litigation, Undisclosed Obligations and Liabilities_. There are (i) no
civil, criminal or administrative actions, suits, claims,
hearings, arbitrations, investigations or other proceedings pending or, to
the knowledge of the Company, threatened against the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries, and (ii) except as reflected or reserved against in the
Companys consolidated balance sheets (and the notes thereto) included in the
Company Reports filed prior to the date hereof and except for obligations or
liabilities incurred in the ordinary course of business since September 30,
2005, no obligations or liabilities of the Company or any of its

-15- (h) _Employee Benefits_.



(i) All benefit and compensation plans, contracts, policies or arrangements
covering current or former employees of the Company and its Subsidiaries (the
" _ _Employees__ ") and current or former directors of the Company, including,
but not limited to, "employee benefit plans" within the meaning of Section
3(3) of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended (" _
_ERISA__ "), and all deferred compensation, severance, stock option, stock
purchase, stock appreciation rights, stock based, incentive and bonus plans
(the " _ _Benefit Plans__ ") are listed on Section 5.1(h) of the Company
Disclosure Letter, and each Benefit Plan which has received a favorable
opinion letter from the Internal Revenue Service National Office, including
any master or prototype plan, has been separately identified. Correct and
complete copies of all Benefit Plans listed on Section 5.1(h) of the Company
Disclosure Letter, including, but not limited to, any trust instruments,
insurance contracts and, with respect to any employee stock ownership plan,
loan agreements forming a part of any Benefit Plans, and all amendments
thereto have been made available to Parent. Except as set forth on Section
5.1(h) of the Company Disclosure Letter, neither the Company nor any of its
Subsidiaries is a party to any employment, severance or change-in-control
agreement with any Person.



(ii) All Benefit Plans, other than Non-U.S. Benefit Plans, (collectively, " _
_U.S. Benefit Plans__ ") are in substantial compliance with ERISA, the Code
and other applicable laws. Each U.S. Benefit Plan which is subject to ERISA
(an " _ _ERISA Plan__ ") that is an "employee pension benefit plan" within the
meaning of Section 3(2) of ERISA (a " _ _Pension Plan__ ") intended to be
qualified under Section 401(a) of the Code, has received a favorable
determination letter from the Internal Revenue Service covering all tax law
changes prior to the Economic Growth and Tax Relief Reconciliation Act of
2001 or has applied to the Internal Revenue Service (the " _ _IRS__ ") for
such favorable determination letter within the applicable remedial amendment
period under Section 401(b) of the Code, and the Company is not aware of any
circumstances likely to result in the loss of the qualification of such Plan
under Section 401(a) of the Code. Neither the Company nor any of its
Subsidiaries has engaged in a transaction with respect to any ERISA Plan
that, assuming the taxable period of such transaction expired as of the date
hereof, could subject the Company or any Subsidiary to a tax or penalty
imposed by either Section 4975 of the Code or Section 502(i) of ERISA in an
amount which would be material. Neither the Company nor any of its
Subsidiaries has incurred or reasonably expects to incur a tax or penalty
imposed by Section 4980 of the Code or Section 502 of ERISA.



(iii) Neither the Company, any or its Subsidiaries nor any entity which is
considered one employer with the Company under Section 4001 of ERISA or
Section 414 of the Code (an " _ _ERISA Affiliate__ ") (x) maintains or
contributes to or has within the past six years maintained or contributed to
a Pension Plan that is  



 

-16-  subject to Subtitles C or D of Title IV of ERISA or (y) maintains or has an
obligation to contribute to or has within the past six years maintained
or had an obligation to contribute to a "multiemployer plans" within the
meaning of Section 3(37) of ERISA. All contributions required to be made under
each Benefit Plan, as of the date hereof, have been timely made and all
obligations in respect of each Benefit Plan have, to the extent required by
GAAP, been properly accrued and reflected in the most recent consolidated
balance sheet filed or incorporated by reference in the Company Reports prior
to the date hereof.

 



(iv) As of the date hereof, there is no material pending or, to the knowledge
of the Company threatened, litigation relating to the Benefit Plans. Neither
the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has any obligations for post-
termination health and life benefits under any ERISA Plan, other than
in accordance with Section 4980B of the Code. The Company or its Subsidiaries
may amend or terminate any such plan at any time without incurring any
liability thereunder other than in respect of claims incurred prior to such
amendment or termination.



(v) There has been no amendment to, announcement by the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries relating to, or change in employee participation or coverage
under, any Benefit Plan which would increase materially the expense of
maintaining such plan above the level of the expense incurred therefor for
the most recent fiscal year. Neither the execution of this Agreement,
Shareholder adoption of this Agreement nor the consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby will (w) entitle any employees of the Company
or any of its Subsidiaries to severance pay or any increase in severance pay
upon any termination of employment after the date hereof, (x) accelerate the
time of payment or vesting or result in any payment or funding (through a
grantor trust or otherwise) of compensation or benefits under, increase the
amount payable or result in any other material obligation pursuant to, any of
the Benefit Plans, (y) limit or restrict the right of the Company or, after
the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby, Parent to merge,
amend or terminate any of the Benefit Plans or (z) result in payments under
any of the Benefit Plans which would not be deductible under Section 162(m) or
Section 280G of the Code. 



(vi) All Non-U.S. Benefit Plans comply in all material respects with
applicable local law. All Non-U.S. Benefit Plans are listed on Section
5.1(h)(vi) of the Company Disclosure Letter. The Company and its Subsidiaries
have no material unfunded liabilities with respect to any such
Non-U.S. Benefit Plan. As of the date hereof, there is no pending or, to the
knowledge of the Company, threatened material litigation relating to Non-U.S.
Benefit Plans.



  

-17- (i) _Compliance with Laws; Licenses_.



(i) The businesses of each of the Company and its Subsidiaries have not been,
and are not being, conducted in violation of any federal, state, local or
foreign law, statute or ordinance, common law, or any rule, regulation,
standard, judgment, order, writ, injunction, decree, arbitration award, agency
requirement, license or permit of any Governmental Entity (collectively, " _
_Laws__ "), except for such violations that are not, individually or in the
aggregate, reasonably likely to have a Material Adverse Effect or prevent,
materially delay or materially impair the consummation of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement. To the knowledge of the Company, no
investigation or review by any Governmental Entity with respect to the
Company, any of its Subsidiaries or the Benefit Plans is pending or,
threatened, nor has any Governmental Entity indicated to the Company an
intention to conduct the same. To the knowledge of the Company, no material
change is required in the Companys or any of its Subsidiaries processes,
properties or procedures in connection with any such Laws, and the Company
has not received any notice or communication of any material noncompliance
with any such Laws that has not been cured as of the date hereof. Each of the
Company and its Subsidiaries has obtained and the businesses of each of the
Company and its Subsidiaries have not been, and are not being, conducted in
violation of or inconsistent with all permits, licenses, certifications,
approvals, registrations, consents, authorizations,
enrollments, accreditations, franchises, variances, waivers, exemptions and
orders issued or granted by a Governmental Entity (" _ _Licenses__ ")
necessary to conduct its business as presently conducted. There exists no
grounds for revocation, suspension or limitation of any License (including,
but not limited to, as a result of the Merger) and no notices have been
received by the Company, its officers or managing employees with respect to
any threatened, pending or possible termination, revocation, suspension or
limitation of any License.



(ii) All of the Companys and its Subsidiaries products are in compliance in
all material respects with all applicable requirements of the Food and Drug
Administration (" _ _FDA__ ") or any other relevant Governmental Entity and
all Licenses, permissions, authorizations, notified body certificates of
compliance or consents required for placing the products on the market in the
United States and Canada. Any modifications by the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries to any product marketed by the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries have been made in accordance with applicable Law. All
manufacturing facilities are operated in compliance in all material respects
with the FDAs Quality System Regulation requirements at 21 C.F.R. Part 820,
as applicable.

the Company or any of its Subsidiaries have been conducted in substantial
compliance with all applicable Laws, including, but not limited to, FDA good
clinical practice and good laboratory practice requirements.

Letter, in the last three years, none of the Companys or its Subsidiaries
products have been recalled or subject to FDA correction or removal
requirements, and the Company and each of its Subsidiaries have not received
notice, either completed or pending, of any proceeding seeking a corrective
action, recall, suspension or seizure of any products. Neither the Company nor
any of its Subsidiaries have received any order, demand or other formal
proceedings from any competent authority or notified body for medical devices
to undertake any form of withdrawal from the market of any of their products
or any product recall and have notified any competent authority or notified
body of the intent to conduct a market withdrawal, product recall or field
correction, and, to the knowledge of the Company, no facts or circumstances
have occurred that are reasonably likely to give rise to any such corrective
action, recall, suspension or seizure.



(v) Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries are included on FDAs AIP
list.



(vi) As of the date hereof, neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries,

6.2. _Acquisition Proposals_.



(a) _No Solicitation or Negotiation_. The Company agrees that neither it nor
any of its Subsidiaries nor any of the officers and directors of it or its
Subsidiaries shall, and that it shall use its commercially reasonable efforts
to instruct and cause its and its Subsidiaries employees, investment
bankers, attorneys, accountants and other advisors or representatives (such
directors, officers, employees, investment bankers, attorneys, accountants and
other advisors or representatives, collectively, " _ _Representatives__ ")
not to, directly or indirectly:



(i) initiate, solicit or encourage any inquiries or the making of any proposal
or offer that constitutes, or could reasonably be expected to lead to, any
Acquisition Proposal (as defined below); or



(ii) engage in, continue or otherwise participate in any discussions or
negotiations regarding, or provide any non-public information or data to any
Person relating to, any Acquisition Proposal.



Notwithstanding anything in the foregoing to the contrary, prior to
obtaining the Company Requisite Vote, the Company may (A) provide information
in response to a request therefor by a Person who has made an unsolicited bona
fide written Acquisition Proposal providing for the acquisition of more than
50% of the assets (on a consolidated basis) or voting power of the equity
securities of the Company if the board of directors receives from the Person
so requesting such information an executed confidentiality agreement on terms
at least as protective for the benefit of the Company as those contained in
the Confidentiality Agreement (as defined in Section 9.7), (B) engage in
discussions or negotiations with any Person who has made such an unsolicited
bona fide written Acquisition Proposal and/or (C) after having complied with
 



 

-35-  the requirements of this Section 6.2, approve, adopt, recommend, or
otherwise declare advisable or propose to approve, adopt, recommend or
declare advisable (publicly or otherwise) such an Acquisition Proposal, if
and only to the extent that, (x) in each such case referred to in clause (A),
(B) or (C) above, the board of directors of the Company determines in good
faith after consultation with outside legal counsel that the failure to take
such action will be reasonably likely to result in a breach of the directors
respective fiduciary duties under applicable Law; (y) in each such case
referred to in clause (A) or (B), if the board of directors of the Company
has determined in good faith based on the information then available and after
consultation with its financial advisor that such Acquisition Proposal either
constitutes a Superior Proposal (as defined below) or is reasonably likely to
result in a Superior Proposal; and (z) in the case referred to in clause (C)
above, the board of directors of the Company determines in good faith (after
consultation with its financial advisor and outside legal counsel) that such
Acquisition Proposal is a Superior Proposal.



(b) _Definitions_. For purposes of this Agreement:



" _ _Acquisition Proposal__ " means (i) any proposal or offer with respect to
a merger, joint venture, partnership, consolidation, dissolution,
liquidation, tender offer, recapitalization, reorganization, share exchange,
business combination or similar transaction involving the Company or (ii) any
proposal or offer to acquire in any manner, directly or indirectly, 15% or
more of any class of equity securities of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries or consolidated total assets (including, without limitation,
equity securities of its Subsidiaries) of the Company, in each case other than
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.



" _ _Superior Proposal__ " means an unsolicited bona fide Acquisition Proposal
involving all or substantially all of the assets (on a consolidated basis) or
voting power of the equity securities of the Company that the board of
directors of the Company has determined in its good faith judgment is
reasonably likely to be consummated in accordance with its terms, taking into
account all legal, financial, regulatory and other aspects of the proposal and
the Person making the proposal, and if consummated, would result in a
transaction more favorable to the Companys Shareholders from a financial
point of view than the transaction contemplated by this Agreement (after
taking into account any revisions to the terms of the transaction
contemplated by this Agreement pursuant to Section 6.2(c)).



(c) _No Change in Recommendation or Alternative Acquisition Agreement_. The
board of directors of the Company and each committee thereof shall not:



(i) except as expressly permitted by this Section 6.2, withhold, withdraw,
qualify or modify (or publicly propose or resolve to withhold, withdraw,
qualify or modify), in a manner adverse to Parent, the Company Recommendation
with respect to the Merger (it being understood that publicly  



 

-36-  taking a neutral position or no position with respect to an Acquisition
Proposal at any time beyond ten (10) Business Days after the first
public announcement of such Acquisition Proposal shall be considered an
adverse modification); or



(ii) except as expressly permitted by Section 8.3(a) hereof, cause or permit
the Company to enter into any letter of intent, memorandum of understanding,
agreement in principle, acquisition agreement, merger agreement or other
agreement (other than a confidentiality agreement referred to in Section
6.2(a) entered into in the circumstances referred to in Section 6.2(a)) (an "
_ _Alternative Acquisition Agreement__ ") relating to any Acquisition
Proposal.



Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement, prior to
obtaining the Company Requisite Vote, the Company board of directors may
withhold, withdraw, qualify or modify the Company Recommendation or approve,
adopt, recommend or otherwise declare advisable any Superior Proposal made
after the date hereof and not solicited, initiated or encouraged in breach of
this Agreement, if, subject to compliance with Section 6.2(f), the Company
board of directors determines in good faith, after consultation with outside
counsel, that failure to do so would be inconsistent with its fiduciary
obligations under applicable law (a " _ _Change of Recommendation__ ");
_provided_ , _however_ , that no Change of Recommendation may be made until
after at least three (3) Days following Parents receipt of written notice
from the Company advising that the Company board of directors intends to take
such action and the basis therefor. In determining whether to make a Change of
Recommendation in response to a Superior Proposal or otherwise, the Company
board of directors shall consider in good faith any changes to the terms of
this Agreement proposed by Parent or any other information provided by Parent
in response to such notice.



(d) _Certain Permitted Disclosure_. Without limiting the right of the Parent
to terminate this Agreement in accordance with Section 8.4(a), nothing
contained in this Section 6.2 shall be deemed to prohibit the Company from
complying with its disclosure obligations under U.S. federal or state law with
regard to an Acquisition Proposal.



(e) _Existing Discussions_. The Company agrees that it will immediately cease
and cause to be terminated any existing activities, discussions or
negotiations with any parties conducted heretofore with respect to any
Acquisition Proposal. The Company agrees that it will take the necessary steps
to promptly inform the individuals or entities referred to in the first
sentence hereof of the obligations undertaken in this Section 6.2 and in the
Confidentiality Agreement. The Company also agrees that it will promptly
request in writing that each Person that has executed a confidentiality
agreement after January 1, 2005 and prior to the date hereof in connection
with its consideration of acquiring it or any of its Subsidiaries to return or
destroy all confidential information heretofore furnished to such Person by
or on behalf of it or any of its Subsidiaries.



 

-37- (f) _Notice_. The Company agrees that it will promptly (and, in any event,
within twenty-four hours) notify Parent if any inquiries, proposals or offers
with respect to an Acquisition Proposal are received by, any such information
is requested from, or any such discussions or negotiation are sought to be
initiated or continued with, it or any of its Representatives indicating, in
connection with such notice, the name of such Person and the material terms
and conditions of any proposals or offers (including, if applicable, copies of
any written requests, proposals or offers, including proposed agreements) and
thereafter shall keep Parent informed, on a current basis, of any developments
affecting the status and terms of any such proposals or offers (including any
amendments thereto) and the status of any such discussions or negotiations,
including any change in the Companys intentions as previously notified.



6.3. _Information Supplied_. The Company, with the cooperation of the Parent,
shall prepare and file with the SEC, as promptly as practicable after the date
of this Agreement, and in any event within fourteen (14) days after the date
hereof, a proxy statement in preliminary form relating to the Shareholders
Meeting (as defined in Section 6.4) (such proxy statement, including any
amendment or supplement thereto, the " _ _Proxy Statement__ "). The Company
agrees, as to its and Subsidiaries, that (i) the Proxy Statement will comply
in all material respects with the applicable provisions of the Exchange Act
and the rules and regulations thereunder and (ii) none of the information
supplied by it or any of its Subsidiaries for inclusion or incorporation by
reference in the Proxy Statement will, at the date of mailing to Shareholders
of the Company or at the time of the Shareholders Meeting, contain any untrue
statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be
stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light
of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading. 



6.4. _Shareholders Meeting_. The Company will take, in accordance with
applicable Law and its articles of organization and by-laws, all action
necessary to convene a meeting of holders of Shares (the " _ _Shareholders
Meeting__ ") as promptly as practicable after the execution of this Agreement
to consider and vote upon the adoption of this Agreement. Subject to Section
6.2 hereof, the board of directors of the Company shall recommend such
adoption and shall take all lawful action to solicit such adoption of this
Agreement. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this
Agreement, the Company, after consultation with the Parent, may adjourn or
postpone the Shareholders Meeting to the extent necessary to ensure that any
required supplement or amendment to the Proxy Statement is provided to the
Companys stockholders or, if as of the time for which the Shareholders
Meeting is originally scheduled (as set forth in the Proxy Statement) there
are insufficient shares of the Companys common stock represented (either in
person or by proxy) to constitute a quorum necessary to conduct the business
of the Shareholders Meeting.



6.5. _Filings; Other Actions; Notification_. (a) _Proxy Statement_. The
Company shall promptly notify Parent of the receipt of all comments of the
SEC with respect to the Proxy Statement and of any request by the SEC for any
amendment or  



 

-38-  supplement thereto or for additional information and shall promptly provide
to Parent copies of all correspondence between the Company and/or any of
its Representatives and the SEC with respect to the Proxy Statement. The
Company and Parent shall each use its commercially reasonable efforts to
promptly provide responses to the SEC with respect to all comments received on
the Proxy Statement by the SEC and the Company shall cause the definitive
Proxy Statement to be mailed as promptly as practicable after the date the SEC
staff advises that it has no further comments thereon or that the Company may
commence mailing the Proxy Statement. 



(b) _Cooperation_. The Company and Parent shall cooperate with each other and
use (and shall cause their respective Subsidiaries to use) their respective
commercially reasonable efforts to take or cause to be taken all actions, and
do or cause to be done all things, reasonably necessary, proper or advisable
on its part under this Agreement and applicable Laws to consummate and make
effective the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement
as soon as practicable, including preparing and filing as promptly as
practicable all documentation to effect all necessary notices, reports and
other filings and to obtain as promptly as practicable all consents,
registrations, approvals, permits and authorizations necessary or advisable to
be obtained from any third party and/or any Governmental Entity in order to
consummate the Merger or any of the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement; _provided_ , _however_ , that (i) nothing in this Agreement,
including without limitation, this Section 6.5, shall require, or be
construed to require, Parent to proffer to, or agree to, sell, divest, lease,
license, transfer, dispose of or otherwise encumber or hold separate and agree
to sell, divest, lease, license, transfer, dispose of or otherwise encumber
before or after the Effective Time, any assets, licenses, operations, rights,
product lines, businesses or interest therein of Parent, the Company or any of
their respective Affiliates (or to consent to any sale, divestiture, lease,
license, transfer, disposition or other encumberment by the Company of any of
its assets, licenses, operations, rights, product lines, businesses or
interest therein or to any agreement by the Company to take any of the
foregoing actions) or to agree to any material changes (including, without
limitation, through a licensing arrangement) or restriction on, or other
impairment of Parents ability to own or operate, any such assets, licenses,
product lines, businesses or interests therein or Parents ability to vote,
transfer, receive dividends or otherwise exercise full ownership rights with
respect to the stock of the Surviving Company and (ii) nothing in this
Agreement shall require, or be construed to require, Parent or any of its
Affiliates to take any other action under this Section 6.5 if the United
States Department of Justice or the United States Federal Trade Commission
authorizes its staff to seek a preliminary injunction or restraining order to
enjoin consummation of the Merger. The Company and Parent will each request
early termination of the waiting period with respect to the Merger under the
HSR Act. Subject to applicable Laws relating to the exchange of information,
Parent shall have the right to direct all matters with any Governmental
Entity consistent with its obligations hereunder; provided that Parent and the
Company shall have the right to review in advance, and to the extent
practicable each will consult with the other on and consider in good faith
the views of the other in connection with, all of the information relating to
Parent or the Company, as the case may be, and any of their respective
Subsidiaries, that appears in  



 

-39-  any filing made with, or written materials submitted to, any third party
and/or any Governmental Entity in connection with the Merger and the
other transactions contemplated by this Agreement (including the Proxy
Statement). In exercising the foregoing rights, each of the Company and Parent
shall act reasonably and as promptly as practicable.



(c) _Information_. The Company and Parent each shall, upon request by the
other, furnish the other with all information concerning itself, its
Subsidiaries, directors, officers and Shareholders and such other matters as
may be reasonably necessary or advisable in connection with the Proxy
Statement or any other statement, filing, notice or application made by or on
behalf of Parent, the Company or any of their respective Subsidiaries to any
third party and/or any Governmental Entity in connection with the Merger and
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.



(d) _Status_. Subject to applicable Laws and the instructions of any
Governmental Entity, the Company and Parent each shall keep the other apprised
of the status of matters relating to completion of the transactions
contemplated hereby, including promptly furnishing the other with copies
of notices or other communications received by Parent or the Company, as the
case may be, or any of its Subsidiaries, from any third party and/or any
Governmental Entity with respect to the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement. The Company shall give prompt notice to
Parent of any change, fact or condition that is reasonably expected to result
in a Material Adverse Effect or of any failure of any condition to Parents
obligations to effect the Merger. 



6.6. _Access and Reports_. Subject to applicable Law, upon reasonable notice,
the Company shall (and shall cause its Subsidiaries to) afford Parents
officers and other authorized Representatives reasonable access, during normal
business hours and in a manner which does not disrupt or interfere with
business operations throughout the period prior to the Effective Time, to its
employees, properties, books, contracts and records and, during such period,
the Company shall (and shall cause its Subsidiaries to) furnish promptly to
Parent all information concerning its business, properties and personnel as
may reasonably be requested, _provided_ that no investigation pursuant to this
Section 6.6 shall affect or be deemed to modify any representation or warranty
made by the Company herein, and _provided_ , _further_ , that the foregoing
shall not require the Company (i) to permit any inspection, or to disclose any
information, that in the reasonable judgment of the Company would result in
the disclosure of any trade secrets of third parties or violate any of its
obligations with respect to confidentiality if the Company shall have used
commercially reasonable efforts to obtain the consent of such third party to
such inspection or disclosure or (ii) to disclose any privileged information
of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries. All requests for information made
pursuant to this Section 6.6 shall be directed to an executive officer of the
Company or such Person as may be designated by the Companys executive
officers. All such information shall be governed by the terms of the
Confidentiality Agreement.



 

-40- 6.7. _Publicity_. The initial press release regarding the Merger shall be a
joint press release and thereafter the Company and Parent each shall consult
with each other prior to issuing any press releases or otherwise making public
announcements with respect to the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement and prior to making any filings with any third
party or any Governmental Entity (including any national securities exchange
or interdealer quotation service) with respect thereto, except as may be
required by Law or by obligations pursuant to any listing agreement with or
rules of any national securities exchange or interdealer quotation service or
by the request of any Government Entity.



6.8. _Employee Benefits_.



(a) Parent agrees that, during the period commencing at the Effective Time and
ending on the first anniversary thereof, the employees of the Company and its
Subsidiaries will continue to be provided with pension and welfare benefits
under employee benefit plans (but excluding equity based benefits) that are no
less favorable in the aggregate than those currently provided by the Company
and its Subsidiaries to such employees. Parent will cause any employee
benefit plans which the employees of the Company and its Subsidiaries are
eligible to participate in to take into account for purposes of eligibility
and vesting thereunder, except for purposes of qualifying for subsidized
early retirement benefits or to the extent it would result in a duplication of
benefits, service by employees of the Company and its Subsidiaries as if such
service were with Parent, to the same extent such service was credited under
a comparable plan of the Company. Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing
contained herein shall obligate Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any of
their Affiliates to (i) maintain any particular Compensation and Benefit Plan
or (ii) retain the employment of any particular employee.



(b) Prior to the Effective Time, if requested by Parent in writing, to the
extent permitted by applicable Law and the terms of the applicable plan or
arrangement, the Company shall (1) cause to be amended the employee benefit
plans and arrangements of it and its Subsidiaries to the extent necessary to
provide that no employees of Parent and its Subsidiaries shall commence
participation therein following the Effective Time unless the Surviving
Corporation or such Subsidiary explicitly authorizes such participation and
(2) cause the Company 401(k) Plan to terminated effective immediately prior to
the Effective Time.



(c) The Company shall take all actions necessary to cause the 2005 Employee
Stock Purchase Plan to terminate immediately prior to the Effective Time and
each holder of an option thereunder shall have the right to exercise such
option in full based on payroll deductions then credited to his or her account
as of a date determined by the board of directors of the Company, which date
shall not be less than ten (10) days preceding the Effective Time.



(d) Prior to making any written or oral communications to the directors,
officers or employees of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries pertaining to
 



 

-41-  compensation or benefit matters that are affected by the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, the Company shall provide Parent with a copy
of the intended communication, Parent shall have a reasonable period of time
to review and comment on the communication, and Parent and the Company shall
cooperate in providing any such mutually agreeable communication.



6.9. _Expenses_. Except as otherwise provided in Section 8.5, whether or not
the Merger is consummated, all costs and expenses incurred in connection with
this Agreement and the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement shall be paid by the party incurring such expense.



6.10. _Indemnification; Directors  and Officers Insurance_. (a) From and
after the Effective Time, each of Parent and the Surviving Corporation agrees
that it will indemnify and hold harmless each present and former director and
officer of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries (in each case, when acting
in such capacity), determined as of the Effective Time (the " _ _Indemnified
Parties__ "), against any costs or expenses (including reasonable attorneys
fees), judgments, fines, losses, claims, damages or
liabilities (collectively, " _ _Costs__ ") incurred in connection with any
claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation, whether civil, criminal,
administrative or investigative, arising out of matters existing or occurring
at or prior to the Effective Time, whether asserted or claimed prior to, at
or after the Effective Time, to the fullest extent that the Company would have
been permitted under Massachusetts law and its articles of organization or by-
laws in effect on the date hereof to indemnify such Person (and Parent or the
Surviving Corporation shall also advance expenses as incurred to the fullest
extent permitted under applicable Law, _provided_ that the Person to whom
expenses are advanced provides an undertaking to repay such advances if it is
ultimately determined that such Person is not entitled to indemnification);
and _provided_ , _further_ , that any determination required to be made with
respect to whether an officers or directors conduct complies with the
standards set forth under Massachusetts law and the Companys articles of
organization and by-laws shall be made by independent counsel selected by the
Surviving Corporation.



(b) Any Indemnified Party wishing to claim indemnification under paragraph
(a) of this Section 6.10, upon learning of any such claim, action, suit,
proceeding or investigation, shall promptly notify Parent thereof, but the
failure to so notify shall not relieve Parent or the Surviving Corporation of
any liability it may have to such Indemnified Party except to the extent such
failure prejudices the indemnifying party. In the event of any such claim,
action, suit, proceeding or investigation (whether arising before or after the
Effective Time), (i) Parent or the Surviving Corporation shall have the right
to assume the defense thereof and Parent shall not be liable to such
Indemnified Parties for any legal expenses of other counsel or any other
expenses subsequently incurred by such Indemnified Parties in connection with
the defense thereof, except that if Parent or the Surviving Corporation elects
not to assume such defense or counsel for the Indemnified Parties advises that
there are issues which raise conflicts of interest between Parent or the
Surviving Corporation and the Indemnified  



 

-42-  Parties, the Indemnified Parties may retain counsel satisfactory to them,
and Parent or the Surviving Corporation shall pay all reasonable fees and
expenses of such counsel for the Indemnified Parties promptly as statements
therefor are received; _provided_ , _however_ , that Parent and the Surviving
Corporation shall be obligated pursuant to this paragraph (b) to pay for only
one firm of counsel for all Indemnified Parties in any jurisdiction unless
the use of one counsel for such Indemnified Parties would present such counsel
with a conflict of interest; _provided_ that the fewest number of counsels
necessary to avoid conflicts of interest shall be used; (ii) the Indemnified
Parties will cooperate in the defense of any such matter, and (iii) Parent and
the Surviving Corporation shall not be liable for any settlement effected
without their prior written consent; and _provided_ , _further_ , that Parent
and the Surviving Corporation shall not have any obligation hereunder to any
Indemnified Party if and when a court of competent jurisdiction shall
ultimately determine, and such determination shall have become final, that
the indemnification of such Indemnified Party in the manner contemplated
hereby is prohibited by applicable Law.



(c) The Surviving Corporation shall maintain the Companys directors and
officers liability insurance (" _ _D andO Insurance__"), or Parent shall
provide for equivalent DandO Insurance providing substantially the same benefits
and levels of coverage as the current DandO Insurance, with respect to acts or
omissions prior to the Effective Time for a period of six years after the
Effective Time so long as the annual premium therefor is not in excess of 200%
of the last annual premium paid by the Company prior to the date hereof (the "
_ _Current Premium__ "); _provided_ ,  _however_ , that if the current DandO
Insurance or such equivalent insurance provided by Parent expires, is
terminated or cancelled or is otherwise unavailable on such terms during such
six-year period, Parent and the Surviving Corporation will use their
commercially reasonable efforts to obtain as much DandO Insurance on
substantially the same terms as can be obtained for the remainder of such
period for a premium not in excess (on an annualized basis) of 200% of the
Current Premium.



(d) If Parent or the Surviving Corporation or any of their respective
successors or assigns (i) shall consolidate with or merge into any other
corporation or entity and shall not be the continuing or surviving corporation
or entity of such consolidation or merger or (ii) shall transfer all or
substantially all of its properties and assets to any individual, corporation
or other entity, then, and in each such case, proper provisions shall be made
so that the successors and assigns of Parent or the Surviving Corporation, as
the case may be, shall assume all of the obligations set forth in this
Section.



(e) The provisions of this Section 6.10 are intended to be for the benefit of,
and shall be enforceable by, each of the Indemnified Parties, their heirs and
representatives.



 

-43- 6.11. _Other Actions by the Company_.



(a) _Rights_. Prior to the Effective Time, the board of directors of
the Company shall take all necessary action to cause the Rights to cease to
be outstanding as of the Effective Time and to terminate the Rights Agreement,
effective immediately as of the Effective Time, without payment of any
consideration in respect thereof.



(b) _Takeover Statutes_. If any Takeover Statute is or may become applicable
to the Merger or the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement, the
Company and its board of directors shall grant such approvals and take such
actions as are necessary so that such transactions may be consummated as
promptly as practicable on the terms contemplated by this Agreement and
otherwise act to eliminate or minimize the effects of such statute or
regulation on such transactions.



(c) _Section 16 Matters_. The board of directors of the Company shall, prior
to the Effective Time, take all such actions as may be necessary or
appropriate pursuant to Rule 16b-3(e) under the Exchange Act to exempt the
conversion to cash of all Shares, Company Options, Company Awards by officers
and directors of the Company who are subject to the reporting requirements of
Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act or by employees or directors of the Company
who may become an officer or director of Parent subject to the reporting
requirements of Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act. Each of Parent and the
Company shall provide to counsel for the other party for its review copies of
such resolutions to be adopted by its board of directors prior to such
adoption and the Company shall provide Parent with such information as shall
be reasonably necessary for Parents board of directors to set forth the
information required in the resolutions of Parents board of directors.

covenant or agreement made by the Company in this Agreement, or any such
representation and warranty shall have become untrue after the date of this
Agreement, such that Section 7.2(a) or 7.2(b) would not be satisfied and such
breach or condition is not curable or, if curable, is not cured within 30
days after written notice thereof is given by Parent to the Company.



8.5. _Effect of Termination and Abandonment_. (a) In the event of termination
of this Agreement and the abandonment of the Merger pursuant to this Article
VIII, this Agreement shall become void and of no effect with no liability on
the part of any party hereto (or of any of its Representatives or Affiliates);
_provided_ , _however_ , that (i) except as otherwise provided herein, no
such termination shall relieve any party hereto of any liability or damages
resulting from any willful or intentional breach of this Agreement and (ii)
the provisions set forth in the second sentence of Section 9.1 shall
survive the termination of this Agreement.



(b) In the event that (i) an Acquisition Proposal shall have been made to the

Subsidiaries (and such Acquisition Proposal or publicly announced intention
shall not have been publicly withdrawn without qualification at least (A)
thirty (30) Business Days prior to, with respect to any termination pursuant
to Section 8.2(a), and (B) at least ten (10) Business Days prior to, with
respect to termination pursuant to Section 8.2(b)) and thereafter this
Agreement is terminated by either Parent or the Company pursuant to Section
8.2(a) or 8.2(b), (ii) this Agreement is terminated (A) by Parent pursuant to
Section 8.4(a), or, with respect to a breach of a covenant or agreement (but
not with respect to a breach of a representation or warranty), by Parent

and, on or prior to the date of the Shareholders Meeting, any event giving
rise to Parents right to terminate under Section 8.4 shall have occurred or
(iii) this Agreement is terminated by the Company pursuant to Section 8.3(a),
then the  



 

-48-  Company shall promptly, but in no event later than two days after the date
of such termination, pay Parent a termination fee of $21,000,000 (the " _
_Termination Fee__ ") ( _provided_ , _however_ , that the Termination Fee to

payable by wire transfer of same day funds,  _provided_ , _however_ , no
Termination Fee shall be payable to Parent pursuant to clause (i) of this
paragraph (b) unless and until within twelve (12) months of such termination
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries shall have entered into an Alternate
Acquisition Agreement with respect to, or shall have consummated or shall have
approved or recommended to the Companys Shareholders or otherwise not
opposed, an Acquisition Proposal; _provided_ that for purposes of this
Agreement, an Acquisition Proposal shall not be deemed to have been "publicly
withdrawn" by any Person if, within twelve (12) months of such termination,
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries shall have entered into an Alternative
Acquisition Agreement with respect to, or shall have consummated or shall have
approved, adopted or recommended to the Companys Shareholders or otherwise
not opposed, an Acquisition Proposal made by or on behalf of such Person or
any of its Affiliates. The Company acknowledges that the agreements contained
in this Section 8.5(b) are an integral part of the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement, and that, without these agreements, Parent and Merger Sub
would not enter into this Agreement; accordingly, if the Company fails to
promptly pay any amount due pursuant to this Section 8.5(b), and, in order to
obtain such payment, Parent or Merger Sub commences a suit which results in a
judgment against the Company for the fee, to which reference is made in this
paragraph (b), the Company shall pay to Parent or Merger Sub its costs and
expenses (including attorneys fees) in connection with such suit, together
with interest on the amount of the fee at the prime rate of Citibank N.A. in
effect on the date such payment was required to be made. Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary in this Agreement, the parties hereby acknowledge
that in the event that the Termination Fee becomes payable and is paid by the
Company to Parent pursuant to this Section 8.5(b), the Termination Fee shall
be Parents and Merger Subs sole and exclusive remedy for monetary damages
under this Agreement.
