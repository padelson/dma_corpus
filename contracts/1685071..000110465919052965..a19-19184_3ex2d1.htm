the seller thereof in cash, without interest and subject to any applicable

Purchaser shall extend the Offer (A) for the minimum period required by any

Business Days per extension to permit such Offer Condition to be satisfied;
and (iii) if, as of the scheduled Expiration Date, any Offer Condition is not

Offer Conditions to be satisfied; _provided, however_ that in no event shall
Purchaser (1) be required to extend the Offer beyond the earliest to occur of

authorize Purchaser to, terminate or withdraw the Offer prior to any scheduled
Expiration Date

 



     

 

 



 

without the prior written consent of the Company except in the event that this
Agreement is terminated in accordance with _Section 9_.

 



 

 **(d)** **Termination of Offer**. In the event that this Agreement is
terminated pursuant to _Section 9.1_, Purchaser shall (and Parent shall cause
Purchaser to) promptly (and, in any event, within 24 hours of such
termination), irrevocably and unconditionally terminate the Offer and shall
not acquire any Shares pursuant to the Offer. If the Offer is terminated or
withdrawn by Purchaser, Purchaser shall promptly return, and shall cause any
depository acting on behalf of Purchaser to return, in accordance with
applicable Laws, all tendered Shares to the registered holders thereof.

 



 

 **(e)** **Offer Documents**. As promptly as practicable on the date of
commencement of the Offer (within the meaning of Rule 14d-2 under the Exchange
Act), Parent and Purchaser shall (i) file with the SEC a tender offer
statement on Schedule TO with respect to the Offer (together with all
amendments and supplements thereto and including the exhibits thereto, the "
** _Schedule TO_** ") that will contain as an exhibit or incorporate by
reference the Offer to Purchase, the form of the related letter of transmittal
and other customary ancillary documents in each case related to the Offer and
(ii) cause the Offer to Purchase and related documents to be disseminated to
the holders of Shares. Each of Parent and Purchaser agrees to cause the
Schedule TO and all exhibits (including the Offer to Purchase), amendments or
supplements thereto (collectively, the " ** _Offer Documents_** ") filed by
either Parent or Purchaser with the SEC to comply in all material respects
with the Exchange Act and other applicable Laws, and to not contain any untrue
statement of a material fact or omission of a material fact necessary in order
to make the statements made therein, in light of the circumstances under which
they are made, not misleading. The Company shall promptly furnish or otherwise
make available to Parent and Purchaser or Parents legal counsel all
information concerning the Company and the Companys stockholders that may be
required or reasonably requested in connection with any action contemplated by
this _Section 2.1(e)_ so as to enable each of Parent and Purchaser to comply
with its obligations hereunder. Each of Parent, Purchaser and the Company
agrees to promptly correct any information provided by it for use in the Offer
Documents if and to the extent that such information shall have become false
or misleading in any material respect, and Parent further agrees to take all
steps necessary to cause the Offer Documents as so corrected to be filed with
the SEC and to be disseminated to the holders of Shares, in each case as and
to the extent required by applicable federal securities Laws. The Company and
its counsel shall be given reasonable opportunity to review and comment on the
Offer Documents prior to the filing thereof with the SEC. Parent and Purchaser
agree to provide the Company and its counsel with prompt notice of any
comments (whether written or oral) that Parent, Purchaser or their counsel may
receive from the SEC or its staff with respect to the Offer Documents (which
notice shall include a copy of any written comments) and Parent and Purchaser
shall provide the Company and its counsel a reasonable opportunity to
participate in the formulation of any response to any such comments of the SEC

Parent, Purchaser and the Company shall respond promptly to any comments of
the SEC or its staff with respect to the Offer Documents or the Offer.

 



 

 **(f)** **Acceptance; Payment Funds**. On the terms specified herein and
subject only to the satisfaction or waiver (to the extent waivable by Parent
or Purchaser) of the Offer Conditions, Purchaser shall, and Parent shall cause
Purchaser to, irrevocably accept for payment

 



     

 

 



 

at the Offer Acceptance Time and pay for, all of the Shares validly tendered
(and not validly withdrawn) pursuant to the Offer as promptly as practicable
after the Offer Acceptance Time. Without limiting the generality of _Section
10.10_, Parent shall cause to be provided to Purchaser all of the funds
necessary to purchase any Shares that Purchaser becomes obligated to purchase
pursuant to the Offer, and shall cause Purchaser to perform, on a timely
basis, all of Purchasers obligations under this Agreement. Parent and
Purchaser shall, and each of Parent and Purchaser shall ensure that all of
their respective controlled Affiliates shall, tender any Shares held by them
into the Offer.

 



 

 **(g)** **Adjustments. **If, between the Agreement Date and the Offer
Acceptance Time, the outstanding Shares are changed into a different number or
class of shares by reason of any stock split, division or subdivision of
shares, stock dividend, reverse stock split, consolidation of shares,
reclassification, recapitalization or other similar transaction, then the
Offer Price shall be appropriately adjusted; it being understood that, for the
avoidance of doubt, nothing in this _Section 2.1(g)_ shall be construed to
permit the Company to take any action that is prohibited by the terms of this
Agreement.

 



 

 **(h)** **CVR Agreement. **At or prior to the Offer Acceptance Time, Parent
shall duly authorize, execute and deliver, and shall ensure that the Rights
Agent duly authorizes, executes and delivers, the CVR Agreement.

 



 

 **2.2** **Company Actions**.

 



 

 **(a)** **Schedule 14D-9**. Subject to Parent and Purchaser having complied
with their obligations in this _Section 2.2(a)_ in all material respects, on
the Offer Commencement Date, promptly following the filing of the Schedule TO,
the Company shall (i) file with the SEC a Tender Offer
Solicitation/Recommendation Statement on Schedule 14D-9 (together with any
exhibits, amendments or supplements thereto, the " ** _Schedule 14D-9_** ")
that, subject to _Section 7.1(a)_ and the last sentence of this _Section
2.2(a)_, shall reflect the Company Board Recommendation and include the notice
and other information required by Section 262(d)(2) of the DGCL and (ii) cause
the Schedule 14D-9 and related documents to be disseminated to holders of
Shares, including by setting the Stockholder List Date as the record date for
purposes of receiving the notice required by Section 262(d)(2) of the DGCL.
The Company agrees that it shall cause the Schedule 14D-9 to comply in all
material respects with the Exchange Act and other applicable Laws, and to not
contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omission of a material fact
necessary in order to make the statements made therein, in light of the
circumstances under which they are made, not misleading. Parent and Purchaser
shall promptly furnish or otherwise make available to the Company or its legal
counsel all information concerning Parent and Purchaser and their stockholders
that may be required or reasonably requested in connection with any action
contemplated by this _Section 2.2(a)_ so as to enable the Company to comply
with its obligations hereunder. Each of Parent, Purchaser and the Company
agrees to promptly correct any information provided by it for use in the
Schedule 14D-9 if and to the extent that such information shall have become
false or misleading in any material respect, and the Company further agrees to
take all steps necessary to cause the Schedule 14D-9 as so corrected to be
filed with the SEC and to be disseminated to the holders of Shares, in each
case as and to the extent required by applicable federal securities Laws.
Parent and its counsel shall be given reasonable opportunity to review and
comment on the Schedule 14D-9 prior to the filing thereof with the SEC. The
Company agrees

 



     

 

 



 

to provide Parent and its counsel with prompt notice of any comments (whether
written or oral) that the Company or its counsel may receive from the SEC or
its staff with respect to the Offer Documents (which notice shall include a
copy of any written comments) and the Company shall provide Parent and its
counsel a reasonable opportunity to participate in the formulation of any
response to any such comments of the SEC or its staff, including the
opportunity to participate in any discussions with the SEC or its staff
concerning such comments. The Company shall respond promptly to any comments
of the SEC or its staff with respect to the Schedule 14D-9. In the event that
the Company Board effects a Company Adverse Change Recommendation in
accordance with the terms _Section 7.1(b)_, the Company shall not be required
to reflect the Company Board Recommendation in the Schedule 14D-9 or any
related documents.

 



 

 **(b)** **Stockholder Lists**. The Company shall promptly furnish Parent
with, or shall cause to be promptly furnished to Parent, a list of its
stockholders, mailing labels and any available listing or computer file
containing the names and addresses of all record holders of Shares and lists
of securities positions of Shares held in stock depositories, in each case
accurate and complete as of the most recent practicable date, and shall
provide to Parent such additional information (including updated lists of
stockholders, mailing labels and lists of securities positions) and such other
assistance as Parent may reasonably request in connection with the Offer and
the Merger (the date of the list used to determine the Persons to whom the
Offer Documents and the Schedule 14D-9 are first disseminated, which date
shall not be more than ten (10) Business Days prior to the date the Offer
Documents and the Schedule 14D-9 are first disseminated, the " ** _Stockholder
List Date_** "). Subject to applicable Law, and except for such steps as are
necessary to disseminate the Offer Documents and any other information
necessary to consummate the Transactions, Parent and Purchaser and their
Representatives shall hold in confidence in accordance with the
Confidentiality Agreement the information contained in any such labels,
listings and files, shall use such information only in connection with the
Offer and the Merger and, if this Agreement shall be terminated, shall
promptly deliver, and shall use their reasonable efforts to cause their agents
to deliver, to the Company (or destroy) all copies and any extracts or
summaries from such information then in their possession or control, and, if
requested by the Company, promptly certify to the Company in writing that all
such material has been returned or destroyed.

At the Effective Time:

 



 

 **(a)** the certificate of incorporation of the Surviving Corporation shall
be amended and restated as of the Effective Time to conform to **Exhibit A**;

 **(a)** At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any
further action on the part of Parent, Purchaser, the Company or any
stockholder of the Company:

 



     

 

 



 

 **(i)** any Shares held immediately prior to the Effective Time by any
Acquired Corporation (including Shares held in the Companys treasury) shall
automatically be canceled and retired and shall cease to exist, and no
consideration shall be delivered in exchange therefor;

 



 

 **(ii)** any Shares held immediately prior to the Effective Time by Parent or
Purchaser or any other direct or indirect wholly owned Subsidiary of Parent
shall automatically be canceled and retired and shall cease to exist, and no

outstanding Shares are changed into a different number or class of shares by
reason of any stock split, division or subdivision of shares, stock dividend,
reverse stock split, consolidation of shares, reclassification,
recapitalization or other similar transaction, then the Merger Consideration
shall be appropriately adjusted; it being understood that nothing in this
_Section 3.5(b)_ shall be construed to permit the Company to take any action

 **3.6** **Surrender of Certificates; Stock Transfer Books**.

 



 

 **(a)** Prior to the Offer Acceptance Time, Parent shall designate a bank or
trust company reasonably acceptable to the Company to act as agent (the " **
_Depository Agent_** "), for the holders of Shares to receive the aggregate
amount of cash to which holders of such Shares shall become entitled pursuant
to _Section 2.1(b)_ at the Offer Acceptance Time and to act as agent (the "
** _Paying Agent_** ") for the holders of Shares to receive the aggregate
amount of cash to which holders of such Shares shall become entitled pursuant
to _Section 3.5_ at the Effective Time. The Paying Agent Agreement pursuant
to which Parent shall appoint the Paying Agent shall be in form and substance
reasonably acceptable to the Company. At or prior to the Offer Acceptance
Time, Parent shall deposit, or shall cause to be deposited, with the
Depository Agent cash sufficient to make payment of the cash consideration
payable pursuant to _Section 2.1(b)_ and with the Paying Agent cash
sufficient to make payment of the cash consideration payable pursuant to
_Section 3.5_ (such deposits, collectively, the " ** _Payment Fund_** "). For
the avoidance of doubt, Parent shall not be required to deposit any funds
related to any CVR with the Rights Agent unless and until such deposit is
required pursuant to the terms of the CVR Agreement. The Payment Fund shall
not be used for any purpose other than to pay the aggregate Offer Price in the
Offer and the aggregate Merger Consideration in the Merger; _provided_ ,
_however_ , the Payment Fund may be invested by the Paying Agent as directed
by the Surviving Corporation; _provided_ , _further_ , that such investments
shall be in obligations of or guaranteed by the United States of America in
commercial paper obligations rated A-1 or P-1 or better by Moodys Investors
Service, Inc. or Standard and

 



      

 

 



 

Poors Corporation, respectively, in certificates of deposit, bank repurchase
agreements or bankers acceptances of commercial banks with capital exceeding
$1 billion, or in money market funds having a rating in the highest investment
category granted by a recognized credit rating agency at the time of
acquisition or a combination of the foregoing and, in any such case, no such
instrument shall have a maturity exceeding three (3) months.

 



 

 **(b)** Promptly after the Effective Time (but in no event later than five
(5) Business Days thereafter), the Surviving Corporation shall cause to be
mailed to each Person who was, at the Effective Time, a holder of record of
Shares entitled to receive the Merger Consideration pursuant to _Section 3.5_
(i) a form of letter of transmittal (which shall be in reasonable and
customary form and shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of
loss and title to the certificates evidencing such Shares (the " **
_Certificates_** ") shall pass, only upon proper delivery of the Certificates
(or effective affidavits of loss in lieu thereof in accordance with _Section
3.6(f)_, if applicable) to the Paying Agent), or a customary agents message
in respect of Book-Entry Shares, and (ii) instructions for use in effecting
the surrender of the Certificates or Book-Entry Shares pursuant to such letter
of transmittal. Upon surrender to the Paying Agent of Certificates (or
effective affidavits of loss in lieu thereof in accordance with _Section
3.6(f)_, if applicable) or Book-Entry Shares, together with such letter of
transmittal in the case of Certificates, duly completed and validly executed
in accordance with the instructions thereto, and such other documents as may
be reasonably required pursuant to such instructions, the holder of such
Certificates or Book-Entry Shares shall be entitled to receive in exchange
therefor the Merger Consideration for each Share formerly evidenced by such
Certificates or Book-Entry Shares, and such Certificates and Book-Entry Shares
shall then be canceled. No interest shall accrue or be paid on the Merger
Consideration payable upon the surrender of any Certificates or Book-Entry
Shares for the benefit of the holder thereof. If the payment of any Merger
Consideration is to be made to a Person other than the Person in whose name
the surrendered Certificates formerly evidencing the Shares is registered on
the stock transfer books of the Company, it shall be a condition of payment
that the Certificate so surrendered shall be endorsed properly or otherwise be
in proper form for transfer and that the Person requesting such payment shall
have paid all transfer and other similar Taxes required to be paid by reason
of the payment of the Merger Consideration to a Person other than the
registered holder of the Certificate surrendered, or shall have established to
the satisfaction of the Surviving Corporation that such Taxes either have been
paid or are not applicable. Payment of the applicable Merger Consideration
with respect to Book-Entry Shares shall only be made to the Person in whose
name such Book-Entry Shares are registered. Until surrendered as contemplated
by this _Section 3.6_, each Certificate and Book-Entry Share shall be deemed
at any time after the Effective Time to represent only the right to receive
the applicable Merger Consideration as contemplated by _Section 3.5_.

 



 

 **(c)** At any time following six (6) months after the Effective Time, the
Surviving Corporation shall be entitled to require the Paying Agent to deliver
to it any funds which had been made available to the Paying Agent and not
disbursed to the holders of Certificates or Book-Entry Shares (including, all
interest and other income received by the Paying Agent in respect of all funds
made available to it), and, thereafter, such holders shall be entitled to look
to the Surviving Corporation (subject to abandoned property, escheat and other
similar Laws) only as general creditors thereof with respect to the Merger
Consideration that may be payable upon due surrender of the Certificates or
Book-Entry Shares held by them. Notwithstanding the foregoing, neither the
Surviving Corporation nor the Paying Agent shall be liable to any holder of
Certificates or Book-

 



     

 

 



 

Entry Shares for the Merger Consideration delivered in respect of such share
to a public official pursuant to any abandoned property, escheat or other
similar Laws. Any amounts remaining unclaimed by such holders at such time at
which such amounts would otherwise escheat to or become property of any
Governmental Body shall become, to the extent permitted by applicable Laws,
the property of the Surviving Corporation or its designee, free and clear of
all claims or interest of any Person previously entitled thereto.

 



 

 **(d)** At the close of business on the day of the Effective Time, the stock
transfer books of the Company with respect to the Shares shall be closed and
thereafter there shall be no further registration of transfers of Shares on
the records of the Company. From and after the Effective Time, the holders of
the Shares outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall cease to
have any rights with respect to such Shares except as otherwise provided
herein or by applicable Laws.

 



 

 **(e)** Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, the Paying Agent,
Rights Agent, Parent, Purchaser, the Surviving Corporation and their
respective Affiliates shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from any
amounts (including any CVRs in respect of Shares) payable pursuant to this
Agreement or the CVR Agreement such amounts as the payor is required to deduct
and withhold therefrom under applicable Tax Laws. To the extent that such
amounts are so deducted and withheld, the applicable payor shall take all
action as may be necessary to ensure that any such amounts so withheld are
timely and properly remitted to the appropriate Governmental Body, and such
amounts so remitted shall be treated for all purposes under this Agreement as
having been paid to the Person to whom such amounts would otherwise have been
paid.

 



 

 **(f)** If any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon
the making of an affidavit of that fact by the holder of the Shares formerly
represented by such Certificate, or by a representative of such holder,
claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if required by
the Surviving Corporation, the posting by such Person of a bond, in such
reasonable amount as Parent may direct, as indemnity against any claim that
may be made against Parent, Purchaser, the Surviving Corporation or any of
their respective Affiliates with respect to such Certificate (which shall not
exceed the Merger Consideration payable with respect to such Certificate), the
Paying Agent will pay (less any amounts entitled to be deducted or withheld
pursuant to _Section 3.6(e)_), in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed
Certificate, the applicable Merger Consideration to be paid in respect of the
Shares formerly represented by such Certificate, as contemplated by this
_Section 3_.

 



 

 **3.7** **Dissenters  Rights**. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement
to the contrary, Shares outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time,
and held by holders who are entitled to demand appraisal rights under Section
262 of the DGCL and have properly exercised and perfected their respective
demands for appraisal of such shares in the time and manner provided in
Section 262 of the DGCL and, as of the Effective Time, have neither
effectively withdrawn nor lost their rights to such appraisal and payment
under the DGCL (the " ** _Dissenting Shares_** "), shall not be converted into
the right to receive Merger Consideration, but shall, by virtue of the Merger,
be automatically canceled and no longer outstanding, shall cease to exist and
the holder thereof shall be entitled to only such consideration as shall be
determined pursuant to Section 262 of the DGCL in respect of such Shares;
_provided_ , that if any such holder shall have failed to perfect or

 



     

 

 



 

shall have effectively withdrawn or lost such holders right to appraisal and
payment under the DGCL, such holders Shares shall be deemed to have been
converted as of the Effective Time into the right to receive the Merger
Consideration (less any amounts entitled to be deducted or withheld pursuant
to _Section 3.6(e)_), and such Shares shall not be deemed to be Dissenting
Shares. Within ten (10) days after the Effective Time, the Surviving
Corporation shall provide each of the holders of Dissenting Shares with the
second notice contemplated by Section 262(d)(2) of the DGCL. The Company shall
give prompt notice to Parent of any demands received by the Company for
appraisal of any Shares, withdrawals of such demands and any other instruments
served pursuant to Section 262 of the DGCL, in each case prior to the
Effective Time. Unless this Agreement is terminated pursuant to _Section 9_,
Parent and Purchaser shall have the right to direct and participate in all
negotiations and proceedings with respect to such demands, and the Company
shall not, without the prior written consent of Parent and Purchaser, settle
or offer to settle, or make any payment with respect to, any such demands or
agree or commit to do any of the foregoing.

 



 

 **3.8** **Treatment of Company Options and Company RSUs**.

 



 

 **(a)** Each Company Option that is outstanding as of immediately prior to
the Offer Acceptance Time shall automatically accelerate and become fully
vested and exercisable effective immediately prior to, and contingent upon,
the Offer Acceptance Time. As of the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger
and without any further action on the part of the holders thereof, each
Company Option which has a per share exercise price that is less than the Cash
Amount (each, an " ** _In the Money Option_** ") that is then outstanding and
unexercised as of immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be cancelled
and converted into the right to receive both (i) an amount in cash equal to
the product of (A) the total number of Shares subject to such Company Option
immediately prior to the Effective Time, _multiplied by_ (B) the excess, if
any, of (x) the Cash Amount over (y) the exercise price payable per Share
under such Company Option, which amount shall be paid in accordance with
_Section 3.8(d)_, and (ii) one (1) CVR for each Share subject to such In the
Money Option immediately prior to the Effective Time (collectively, the " **
_In the Money Option Consideration_** ").

 



 

 **(b)** As of the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any
further action on the part of the holders thereof, each Company Option which
has a per share exercise price that is equal to or more than the Cash Amount
(each, an " ** _Out of the Money Option_** ") that is then outstanding and
unexercised as of immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be cancelled
and converted into the right to receive a cash payment from Parent on the
Milestone Payment Date, if any, with respect to each Share subject to such Out
of the Money Option immediately prior to the Effective Time equal to the
amount by which $29.00 exceeds the exercise price payable per Share under such
Out of the Money Option (the " ** _Out of the Money Option Consideration_**
"), which amount shall be paid in accordance with _Section 3.8(d)_.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, (i) any Company Option (including any Out of
the Money Option) with an exercise price payable per Share equal to or greater
than $29.00 shall be cancelled at the Effective Time without any consideration
payable (whether in the form of cash or a CVR or otherwise) therefor whether
before or after the Effective Time and (ii) in the event the Milestone Payment
Date does not occur, no payment (whether in the form of the Out of the Money
Option Consideration or otherwise) shall be made in respect of any Out of the
Money Option following the Effective Time.

 



     

 

 



 

 **(c)** Each Company RSU that is outstanding as of immediately prior to the
Effective Time, whether vested or unvested, shall be cancelled and converted
into the right to receive both (i) an amount in cash equal to the product of
(A) the total number of Shares subject to such Company RSU immediately prior
to the Effective Time, whether vested or unvested, _multiplied by_ (B) the
Cash Amount, which amount shall be paid in accordance with _Section 3.8(d)_,
and (ii) one (1) CVR for each Share subject to such Company RSU immediately
prior to the Effective Time (collectively, the " ** _RSU Consideration_** ").

 



 

 **(d)** As soon as reasonably practicable after the Effective Time (but no
later than the later of ten (10) Business Days after the Effective Time or the
first payroll date after the Effective Time), Parent shall, or shall cause the
Surviving Corporation to, pay through the Surviving Corporations payroll the
aggregate cash consideration payable pursuant to _Section 3.8(a)_ and
_Section 3.8(c)_ with respect to In the Money Options and Company RSUs held
by current or former employees of the Company or any other Acquired
Corporation (net of any withholding Taxes required to be deducted and withheld
by applicable Laws in accordance with _Section 3.6(e)_); _provided, however,_
that to the extent the holder of an In the Money Option or a Company RSU did
not receive such In the Money Option or Company RSU in the holders capacity
as an employee of the Company or any other Acquired Corporation for employment
tax purposes, the In the Money Option Consideration or RSU Consideration
payable pursuant to _Section 3.8_ with respect to such In the Money Option or
Company RSU (as applicable) shall be deposited in the Payment Fund and paid by
the Paying Agent in the manner described in _Section 3.6_ (or, if the Paying
Agent is unable to administer such payments, such payments will instead be
paid by the Surviving Corporation). As soon as practicable following the
Milestone Payment Date, if any, but in no event later than March 15 of the
calendar year following the calendar year in which the Milestone Payment Date
occurs, Parent shall, or shall cause the Surviving Corporation to pay through

available to Parent or Parents Representatives an accurate and complete copy

Contract in the Electronic Data Gathering, Analysis and Retrieval (EDGAR)
database of the SEC on an unredacted basis. Neither the applicable Acquired

neither the applicable Acquired Corporation, nor, to the Knowledge of the
Company, the other party has taken or failed to take any action that with or
without notice, lapse of time or both would constitute a material breach of or

respect to the applicable Acquired Corporation and, to the Knowledge of the
Company, the other party, a valid agreement, binding, and in full force and

Effect.

 



 

 **(c)** The Acquired Corporations have paid any amounts due under any Company

obligations, in either milestone payments, royalties or other amounts
calculated based upon (i) the achievement of regulatory or commercial

Agreement; (iii) liabilities arising in the ordinary course of business after
the Agreement Date in connection with performance obligations of an Acquired
Corporation under Contracts (other than those liabilities resulting from any

in the ordinary course of business or in connection with the Transactions; and
(v) liabilities that, individually or in the aggregate, have not had and would
not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect.

 



 

 **4.11** **Compliance with Laws**. Each Acquired Corporation is, and since
January 1, 2017, each Acquired Corporation has been, in compliance with all
applicable Laws, except where the failure to be in compliance has not had and
would not reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a
Material Adverse Effect. Since January 1, 2017 through the Agreement Date, no
Acquired Corporation has been given written notice of, or, to the Knowledge of
the Company, been charged with, any unresolved violation of any Law, except,
in each case, for any such violation that would not, individually or in the
aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect.

 



 

 **4.12** **Regulatory Matters**.

 



 

 **(a)** Except as would not reasonably be expected to be, individually or in
the aggregate, material to the Acquired Corporation, taken as a whole, the
Acquired Corporations have filed with the applicable regulatory authorities
(including the FDA or any other Governmental Body performing functions similar
to those performed by the FDA or otherwise having jurisdiction over the
safety, efficacy, approval, development, testing, labeling, manufacture,
storage, marketing, promotion, sale, commercialization, shipment, import,
export or distribution of pharmaceutical products (such Governmental Bodies,
collectively, the " ** _Specified Governmental Bodies_** ")) all required
filings, permits, claims, responses, declarations, listings, registrations,
reports or submissions, including adverse event reports. Except as would not
reasonably be expected to be, individually or in the aggregate, material to
the Acquired Corporations, taken as a whole, all such filings, permits,
claims, responses, declarations, listings, registrations, reports or
submissions were in compliance with applicable Laws when filed (or were
corrected or supplemented by a subsequent submission) and, and no deficiencies
have been asserted by any Specified Governmental Body with respect to any such
filings, declarations, listing, registrations, reports or submissions.

 



     

 

 



 

 **(b)** Except as would not reasonably be expected, individually or in the

investigations sponsored by the Acquired Corporations are being conducted in
compliance with all applicable clinical protocols, informed consents and Laws,
including Good Clinical Practices requirements (preclinical and clinical),
Good Manufacturing Practices and pharmacovigilance. As of the Agreement Date,

such case) establishes a reasonable basis the FDA or any other Specified
Governmental Body to invoke its Fraud, Untrue Statements of Material Facts,
Bribery, and Illegal Gratuities Final Policy (or similar rule, regulation or
policy). Except as has not had or would not reasonably be expected to have,
individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect, no Acquired
Corporation is the subject of any pending or, to the Knowledge of the Company,
threatened investigation by the FDA pursuant to its Fraud, Untrue Statements
of Material Facts, Bribery, and Illegal Gratuities Final Policy. None of the
Acquired Corporations nor, to the Knowledge of the Company, any officers,
employees, agents or clinical investigators of the Acquired Corporations has
been suspended or debarred or convicted of any crime or engaged in any conduct
that would reasonably be expected to result in (a) debarment under 21 U.S.C.
Section 335a or any similar Law or (b) exclusion under 42 U.S.C. Section
1320a-7 or any similar Law.

 



 

 **(d)** Except as has not had and would not reasonably be expected to have,
individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect, each Acquired
Corporation is in compliance and, since January 1, 2017, has been in
compliance with all healthcare laws applicable to the operation of its
business as currently conducted, including (i) any and all applicable federal,
state and local fraud and abuse laws, including the federal Anti-Kickback
Statute (42 U.S.C. Section 1320a-7(b)), the civil False Claims Act (31 U.S.C.
Section 3729 et seq.) and the regulations promulgated pursuant to such
statutes; (ii) the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of
1996, the Health Information and Technology for Economic and Clinical Health
Act, and the regulations promulgated pursuant thereto; (iii) Laws which are

relating to the billing or submission of claims, collection of accounts
receivable, underwriting the cost of, or provision of management or
administrative services in connection with, any and all of the foregoing, by
an Acquired Corporation. No enforcement, regulatory or administrative
proceeding is pending, or, to the Knowledge of the Company, no such
enforcement, regulatory or administrative proceeding has been threatened,
against any Acquired Corporation under the Federal Drug and Cosmetics Act, the
Anti-Kickback Statute, or similar Laws other than any such proceeding that
would not reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a
Material Adverse Effect.

 



 

 **(e)** As of the Agreement Date, the Product (or to the Knowledge of the
Company any component thereof) has not been recalled, withdrawn, suspended or
discontinued (whether voluntarily or otherwise). No Legal Proceeding is
pending seeking the recall,

 



     

 

 



 

withdrawal, suspension or seizure of the Product is pending or, to the
Knowledge of the Company, threatened against any of the Acquired Corporations.

 



 

 **(f)** To the Knowledge of the Company, there has been (i) no adverse event
reportable to the FDA or other Specified Governmental Body with respect to the
safety or efficacy of the Product or (ii) no scientific or technical fact or
circumstance that, in the case of clauses (i) or (ii) has had or would
reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Material
Adverse Effect.

 



 

 **4.13** **Certain Business Practices**. Except as would not be material to
the Acquired Corporations, taken as a whole, since January 1, 2017, neither
the Company, nor any other Acquired Corporation nor any of their respective
directors, officers or employees or, to the Knowledge of the Company, any of
their other respective representatives or agents (in each case, acting in such
capacity on behalf of any Acquired Corporation within the meaning of the
Foreign Corrupt Practices Act of 1977, as amended) has (i) used any funds
(whether of an Acquired Corporation or otherwise) for unlawful contributions,
gifts, entertainment or other unlawful expenses relating to political
activity, (ii) made any unlawful payment to foreign or domestic government
officials or employees or to foreign or domestic political parties or
campaigns or (iii) violated any provision of any Anti-Corruption Laws or any
rules or regulations promulgated thereunder, anti-money laundering laws or any
rules or regulations promulgated thereunder or any applicable Law of similar
effect. Since January 1, 2017 through the Agreement Date, no Acquired
Corporation has received any written communication from a Governmental Body
that alleges any of the foregoing.

 



 

 **4.14** **Governmental Authorizations**. The Acquired Corporations hold all
Governmental Authorizations necessary to enable each Acquired Corporation to
conduct its business in the manner in which its business is currently being
conducted, except where failure to hold such Governmental Authorizations has
not had and would not reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the
aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect. The Governmental Authorizations held by
the Acquired Corporations are, in all material respects, valid and in full
force and effect. The Acquired Corporations are, and since January 1, 2017
have been, in compliance with the terms and requirements of such Governmental
Authorizations, except where failure to be in compliance would not have a
Material Adverse Effect.

 



 

 **4.15** **Tax Matters**.

 



 

 **(a)** Except as has not had and would not reasonably be expected to have,
individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect, (i) each of the
Tax Returns required to be filed by the Acquired Corporations with any

into account any extensions of such due date), and all such Tax Returns are
accurate and complete, (ii) all Taxes of the Acquired Corporations (whether or
not shown as due on any Tax Return) have been timely paid and (iii) the
Acquired Corporations have withheld and paid over (or set aside for payment
when due) to the appropriate Governmental Body all Taxes required to have been

independent contractor, stockholder, creditor or other third party.
Appropriate reserves have been established in accordance with GAAP on the
Balance Sheet and the consolidated financial statements of the Company for the
unpaid Taxes of the Acquired Corporations, and none

 



     

 

 



 

of the Acquired Corporations has incurred any material liability for Taxes
since the date of the Balance Sheet other than in the ordinary course of
business and other than Transaction Payroll Taxes.

 



 

 **(b)** Except as has not had and would not reasonably be expected to have,
individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect, no deficiency for
any Tax has been asserted or assessed by a Governmental Body in writing
against any Acquired Corporation which deficiency has not been paid, settled
or withdrawn or is not being contested in good faith and in accordance with
applicable Laws. No written claim has been made by a Governmental Body that an
Acquired Corporation is subject to Tax in a jurisdiction where it has not
filed Tax Returns. No audits, examinations, claims or other proceedings with
respect to material Taxes or Tax Returns of the Acquired Corporations are
currently in process, pending or, to the Knowledge of the Company, threatened.

 



 

 **(c)** None of the Acquired Corporations is a party to or is bound by any
material Tax sharing, allocation or indemnification agreement or arrangement
that would have a continuing effect after the Closing Date (other than such
agreements or arrangements (i) exclusively between or among the Acquired
Corporations or (ii) with third parties made in the ordinary course of
business, the principal purpose of which is not Tax). No Acquired Corporation
(i) has been a member of an affiliated group (within the meaning of Section
1504(a) of the Code) filing a consolidated federal income Tax Return (or any
similar group for state, local or foreign Tax purposes), in each case other

material liability for the Taxes of another Person (other than the Company and
its Subsidiaries) under Treasury Regulations Section 1.1502-6 (or any similar
provision of state, local or foreign law), as a transferee or successor, or
otherwise by operation of Laws.

 



 

 **(d)** Since January 1, 2017, no Acquired Corporation has been either a
"distributing corporation" or a "controlled corporation" in a distribution of
stock intended to qualify for tax-free treatment under Section 355 of the
Code.

 



 

 **(e)** There are no Encumbrances for any material Taxes upon the assets of
the Acquired Corporations, other than Permitted Encumbrances.

 



 

 **(f)** None of the Acquired Corporations has entered into any Contract with

ordinary course of business.

 



 

 **(g)** The Acquired Corporations have conducted all related party
transactions at arms length in compliance in all material respects with
Section 482 of the Code and the U.S. Treasury Regulations promulgated
thereunder (and any similar provision of state, local or foreign Tax Law) and
have maintained documentation in connection with such related party
transactions in accordance, in all material respects, with Sections 482 and

Knowledge of the Company, seeking to represent any employees of any Acquired
Corporation. Since January 1, 2017, there has not been any strike, slowdown,
work stoppage, interruption of work, lockout, picketing, union organization
attempts or labor dispute affecting any Acquired Corporation or any of their
respective employees. There is not now pending, and, to the Knowledge of the

plant closing notification, employment statute or regulation, privacy right,
labor dispute, workers compensation policy or long-term disability policy,
safety, retaliation, immigration or discrimination matters involving any
Company Associate, including charges of unfair labor practices or harassment
complaints, other than any Legal Proceedings that would not reasonably be
expected to have a Material Adverse Effect. Since January 1, 2017, the Company
has complied in all material respects with all applicable Laws related to
employment and labor, including applicable Laws relating to employment
practices, wages, hours, retaliation, employment discrimination, harassment,
immigration and other terms and conditions of employment and any reduction in

 **(e)** Section 4.16(e) of the Company Disclosure Letter sets forth an
accurate and complete list, as of the Agreement Date, of each material
Employee Plan. The Company has either delivered or made available to Parent or
Parents Representatives prior to the execution of this Agreement with respect
to each material Employee Plan accurate and complete copies of the following,
as applicable: (i) all plan documents and all amendments thereto (or, in the

the IRS; (iii) the most recent annual actuarial valuation, financial statement
or similar report and the most recent Form 5500; and (iv) the most recent
summary plan descriptions and any material modifications thereto. For purposes
of this _Section 4.16(e)_ and Section 4.16(e) of the Company Disclosure
Letter, the Company shall have complied with its obligations under this
_Section 4.16(e)_ by listing and making available to Parent or Parents
Representatives (x) with respect to employment, termination or severance
agreements with any non-officer Company Associate, forms thereof, (y) with
respect to Company Stock Awards, forms of grant notices and related
documentation and (z) with respect to consulting agreements with any Company
Associate, forms thereof, in each case, indicating where such agreement
deviates in any material respect (except with respect to amount of salary or
compensation or number of Shares, as applicable) from the form of agreement or
notice. No Employee Plan is subject to the laws of a jurisdiction outside the
United States.

 



 

 **(f)** Neither an Acquired Corporation nor any other Person that would be
or, at any relevant time, would have been considered a single employer with
the Company within the meaning of Section 414(b), (c), (m), or (o) of the Code
sponsors, maintains, contributes to or is required to contribute to, or has
during the past six years, sponsored, maintained, contributed to, or been
required to contribute to, a plan subject to Section 302 or Title IV of ERISA
or Code Section 412, including any "single employer" defined benefit plan or
any "multiemployer plan" each as defined in Section 4001 of ERISA.

 



 

 **(g)** Each of the Employee Plans that is intended to be qualified under
Section 401(a) of the Code has obtained a favorable determination letter (or
opinion letter, if applicable) as to its qualified status under the Code, and
to the Knowledge of the Company, no event, fact or development has occurred or
exists that would be reasonably expected to result in the loss of the
qualified status of any such Employee Plan. Each of the Employee Plans is now
and has been maintained and operated in compliance in all material respects
with its terms and all applicable Laws, including but not limited to ERISA and
the Code.

 



 

 **(h)** No Acquired Corporation has any liability in respect of post-
retirement health, medical or life insurance benefits for any Company
Associate (or any dependent of a Company Associate) other than for
continuation coverage required under Section 4980B of the Code or any similar
Law, and no circumstances exist that would reasonably be expected to result in
any Acquired Corporation becoming obligated to provide such benefits.

 



 

 **(i)** The consummation of the Transactions (including in combination with
other events or circumstances) will not (i) result in any payment becoming due
to any Company Associate, including any retention, change in control,
severance, termination, unemployment compensation or similar compensation or
benefits, (ii) result in the acceleration of the time of payment or vesting,
or the increase in the amount of, compensation or benefits due to any such
Company Associate under an Employee Plan or otherwise, (iii) directly or
indirectly cause the Acquired Corporations to transfer or set aside any assets
to fund any benefits under any Employee Plan, (iv) otherwise give rise to any
material liability under any Employee Plan or (v) result in any payment that
would be considered an "excess parachute payment" within the meaning of
Section 280G of the Code. No Company Associate is entitled to any gross-up,
make-whole or other additional payment in respect of any Tax or interest and
penalty related thereto.

entered into any legally-binding agreement, order, settlement, judgment,
injunction or decree involving any uncompleted, outstanding or unresolved
obligations on the part of the respective Acquired Corporations, in each of
cases (1) and (2), relating to or arising under Environmental Laws; (c) to the
Knowledge of the Company, (1) no Person has been exposed to any Hazardous
Materials at any property or facility and (2) there are and have been no
Hazardous Materials present or Released on, at, under or from any property or

a manner or at a level that would reasonably be expected to result in any
claim against or liability of an Acquired Corporation under any Environmental
Law; and (d) no Acquired Corporation has assumed, undertaken, or otherwise
become subject to any liability of another Person relating to Environmental
Laws.

 



 

 **4.18** **Insurance**. The Company has delivered or made available to Parent

insurance policies and all material self-insurance programs and arrangements

individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect, all such
insurance policies are in full force and effect, no written notice of
cancellation or modification has been received, and there is no existing
default or event which, with the giving of notice or lapse of time or both,

claim pending under any of the Companys insurance policies as to which
coverage has been denied or disputed by the underwriters of such policies.

 



 

 **4.19** **Legal Proceedings; Orders**. As of the Agreement Date, there is no
Legal Proceeding pending or, to the Knowledge of the Company, threatened
against an Acquired Corporation or, to the Knowledge of the Company, against
any director, officer or employee of any Acquired Corporation in such
individuals capacity as such, other than Legal Proceedings that have not had
and would not reasonably be expected to (1) have, individually or in the
aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect or (2) prevent, materially delay or
materially impair the consummation by the Acquired Corporations of the Offer
or the Merger. There is no outstanding order, writ, injunction or judgment to
which an Acquired Corporation is subject that is reasonably likely to have a
Material Adverse Effect. No investigation or review by any Governmental Body
or Nasdaq with respect to an Acquired Corporation is pending or, to the
Knowledge of the Company, is being threatened, other than any investigations
or reviews that have not had and would not reasonably be expected to have,
individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect.

 



 

 **4.20** **Authority; Binding Nature of Agreement**. The Company has the
corporate power and authority, and has taken all corporate action necessary,
to enter into and deliver and to

 



     

 

 



 

perform its obligations under this Agreement and to consummate the

in accordance with its terms, subject to (i) laws of general application
relating to bankruptcy, insolvency and the relief of debtors and (ii) rules of
law governing specific performance, injunctive relief and other equitable

 **4.21** **Section 203 of the DGCL**. Assuming the accuracy of the
representations and warranties set forth in _Section 5.7_, the Company Board
has taken all actions so that the restrictions applicable to business
combinations contained in Section 203 of the DGCL and any other Takeover Laws
are inapplicable to the execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement,

Companys financial advisors and outside legal counsel, that such Acquisition
Proposal constitutes or is reasonably likely to lead to a Superior Offer (and
the Company provides Parent with written notice of this determination), then
the Company and its Representatives may (i) furnish, pursuant to (but only
pursuant to) an Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement, information (including
non-public information) with respect to the Acquired Corporations to the
Person or group of Persons who has made such Acquisition Proposal ( _provided_
that the Company shall substantially concurrently provide to Parent any
information concerning the Acquired Corporations that is provided to any

 



     

 

 



 

Person given such access which was not previously provided to Parent or its
Representatives) and (ii) engage in or otherwise participate in discussions or
negotiations with the Person or group of Persons making such Acquisition
Proposal.

 



 

 **(c)** Following the Agreement Date, the Company shall (i) promptly (and in
any event within 36 hours) notify Parent orally and in writing of any
inquiries, proposals or offers with respect to, or that would reasonably be
expected to lead to, an Acquisition Proposal, or any request for information
concerning any Acquired Corporation from any Person or group of Persons who
have made or could reasonably be expected to make an Acquisition Proposal, in
each case that are received by any Acquired Corporation or any of their
Representatives, including the identity of the Person or group of Persons
making such Acquisition Proposal, request, inquiry, proposal or offer, (ii)
provide to Parent a summary of the material terms and conditions of any
Acquisition Proposal, (iii) keep Parent reasonably informed of any material
developments, discussions or negotiations (including any amendments or
proposed amendments to any material terms or conditions) regarding any
Acquisition Proposal on a reasonably prompt basis, (iv) promptly provide
Parent with copies of all written Acquisition Proposals, requests, inquiries,
proposals or offers or other materials, including proposed agreements and
financing documentation, received by any Acquired Corporation or any of their
Representatives with respect to any Acquisition Proposal, or that any Acquired
Corporation or any of their Representatives delivers to any Person or group
with respect to any Acquisition Proposal, and (v) upon the request of Parent,
reasonably inform Parent of the status of such Acquisition Proposal.

 



 

 **(d)** Nothing in this Agreement, including this _Section 6.3_ or _Section
7.1_, shall prohibit the Company from (i) taking and disclosing to the
stockholders of the Company a position contemplated by Rule 14e-2(a), Rule
14d-9 or Item 1012(a) of Regulation M-A promulgated under the Exchange Act,
(ii) making any disclosure to the stockholders of the Company that is required
by applicable securities Laws or (iii) making any "stop, look and listen"
communication pursuant to Rule 14d-9(f) promulgated under the Exchange Act;
_provided_ that this _Section 6.3(d)_ shall not be deemed to permit the
Company Board to make a Company Adverse Change Recommendation except to the
extent permitted by and in accordance with _Section 7.1(b)_.

 



 

 **SECTION 7.** **ADDITIONAL COVENANTS OF THE PARTIES**

 



 

 **7.1** **Company Board Recommendation**.

 



 

 **(a)** Subject to _Section 7.1(b)_, the Company hereby consents to the
inclusion of a description of the Company Board Recommendation in the Offer
Documents. During the Pre-Closing Period, neither the Company Board nor any
committee thereof shall (i)(A) withdraw or withhold (or modify, change or
qualify in a manner adverse to Parent or Purchaser), or publicly propose to
withdraw or withhold (or modify, change or qualify in a manner adverse to
Parent or Purchaser), the Company Board Recommendation, (B) adopt, approve,
recommend or declare advisable, or publicly propose to adopt, approve,
recommend or declare advisable, any Acquisition Proposal, (C) if a tender
offer or exchange offer for the Company Common Stock that constitutes an
Acquisition Proposal is commenced (within the meaning of Rule 14d-2 under the
Exchange Act), fail to recommend against acceptance of such tender offer or
exchange offer within ten (10) Business Days or (D) if any Acquisition
Proposal has been made public, fail to reaffirm the Company Board
Recommendation upon request of Parent within the earlier of three (3) Business

 



     

 

 



 

Days prior to the then scheduled Expiration Date or 10 Business Days after
Parent requests such reaffirmation with respect to such Acquisition Proposal (
_provided, however,_ that Parent may make such request only once with respect
to such Acquisition Proposal unless such Acquisition Proposal is subsequently
publicly modified in any material respect in which case Parent may make such
request once each time such modification is made) (any action described in
this clause (i) being referred to as a " ** _Company Adverse Change
Recommendation_** ") or (ii) adopt, approve, recommend or declare advisable,
or propose to adopt, approve, recommend or declare advisable, enter into or
allow the Company or any other Acquired Corporation to execute or enter into
any Contract (A) with respect to any Acquisition Proposal or (B) requiring, or
which would reasonably be expected to cause, the Company to abandon,
terminate, delay or fail to consummate the Transactions (other than an
Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement).

 



 

 **(b)** Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement,
at any time prior to accepting for payment such number of Shares validly
tendered and not validly withdrawn pursuant to the Offer as satisfies the
Minimum Condition (the " ** _Offer Acceptance Time_** "):

 



 

 **(i)** if the Company has received a _bona fide_ written Acquisition
Proposal (which Acquisition Proposal did not result from or arise out of a
breach of _Section 6.3(a)_) from any Person that has not been withdrawn and
after consultation with the Companys financial advisors and outside legal
counsel, the Company Board shall have determined, in good faith, that such
Acquisition Proposal is a Superior Offer, (x) the Company Board may make a
Company Adverse Change Recommendation or (y) the Company may terminate this
Agreement pursuant to _Section 9.1(e)_ to enter into a Specified Agreement
with respect to such Superior Offer, in each such case, if and only if: (A)
the Company Board determines in good faith, after consultation with the
Companys outside legal counsel, that the failure to do so would be
inconsistent with the fiduciary duties of the Company Board under applicable
Law; (B) the Company shall have given Parent prior written notice of its
intention to consider making a Company Adverse Change Recommendation or
terminate this Agreement pursuant to _Section 9.1(e)_ at least five (5)
Business Days prior to making any such Company Adverse Change Recommendation
or termination (a " ** _Determination Notice_** ") (which notice shall not
constitute a Company Adverse Change Recommendation ); and (C) (1) the Company
shall have provided to Parent a summary of all the material terms and
conditions of the Acquisition Proposal and all other information to be
provided in accordance with _Section 6.3(d)_, including a copy of the
agreements (including financing arrangements) with respect to such Acquisition
Proposal, (2) the Company shall have given Parent the five (5) Business Days
after Parents receipt of the Determination Notice to propose revisions to the
terms of this Agreement or make another proposal, so that such Acquisition
Proposal would cease to constitute a Superior Offer, and, to the extent
requested by Parent, shall have negotiated in good faith with Parent and its
Representatives with respect to such proposed revisions or other proposal, if
any, and (3) at the end of such five (5) Business Day period (x) after
consultation with the Companys financial advisors and outside legal counsel,
the Company Board shall have determined in good faith that such Acquisition
Proposal is a Superior Offer and (y) after consultation with the Companys
outside legal counsel, that the failure to make the Company Adverse Change
Recommendation or terminate this Agreement pursuant to _Section 9.1(e)_ would
be inconsistent with the fiduciary duties of the Company Board under
applicable Laws. For the avoidance of doubt, the provisions of this _Section
7.1(b)(i)_ shall also apply to any change to any of the financial terms
(including the form, amount and timing of payment of consideration) or any

 



     

 

 



 

other material amendment to any Acquisition Proposal, each of which will
require a new Determination Notice (except that the references to five (5)
Business Days shall instead be three (3) Business Days); and

 



 

 **(ii)** other than in connection with an Acquisition Proposal (which shall
be subject to _Section 7.1(b)(i)_), the Company Board may make a Company
Adverse Change Recommendation in response to a Change in Circumstance, if and
only if: (A) the Company Board determines in good faith, after consultation
with the Companys outside legal counsel, that the failure to do so would be
inconsistent with the fiduciary duties of the Company Board under applicable
Laws; (B) the Company shall have given Parent a Determination Notice at least
five (5) Business Days prior to making any such Company Adverse Change
Recommendation; and (C) (1) the Company shall have specified the Change in
Circumstance in reasonable detail in the Determination Notice, including the
facts and circumstances that render a Company Adverse Change Recommendation
necessary in the determination of the Company Board, (2) the Company shall
have given Parent the five (5) Business Days after Parents receipt of the
Determination Notice to propose revisions to the terms of this Agreement or
make another proposal, and shall have negotiated in good faith with Parent and
its Representatives, to the extent Parent desires to do so, with respect to
such proposed revisions or other proposal, if any, and (3) after considering
any such revisions or proposals and the results of any such negotiations and
giving effect to the revisions or proposals made by Parent, if any, after
consultation with its outside legal counsel, the Company Board shall have
determined, in good faith, that the failure to make the Company Adverse Change
Recommendation in response to such Change in Circumstance would be
inconsistent with the fiduciary duties of the Company Board under applicable
Law. For the avoidance of doubt, the provisions of this _Section 7.1(b)(ii)_
shall also apply to any material change to the facts and circumstances
relating to such Change in Circumstance, each of which will require a new
Determination Notice (except that the references to five (5) Business Days
shall instead be three (3) Business Days).

 



 

 **7.2** **Filings, Consents and Approvals**.

 



 

 **(a)** Subject to the terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement, each
of the Parties shall use their respective reasonable best efforts to take, or
cause to be taken, all actions, to file, or cause to be filed, all documents
and to do, or cause to be done, and to assist and cooperate with the other
Parties in doing, all things reasonably necessary, proper or advisable under
applicable Antitrust Laws to consummate and make effective the Transactions as
soon as reasonably practicable, including (i) the obtaining of all necessary
actions or nonactions, waivers, consents, clearances, decisions, declarations,
approvals and, expirations or terminations of waiting periods from
Governmental Bodies and the making of all necessary registrations and filings
and the taking of all steps as may be necessary to obtain any such consent,
decision, declaration, approval, clearance or waiver, or expiration or
termination of a waiting period by or from, or to avoid an action or
proceeding by, any Governmental Body in connection with any Antitrust Law;
(ii) the obtaining of all necessary consents, authorizations, approvals or
waivers from third parties; and (iii) the execution and delivery of any
additional instruments necessary to consummate the Transactions.

 



 

 **(b)** The Parties agree to use their respective reasonable best efforts to
promptly take, and cause their respective Affiliates to use their respective
reasonable best efforts to take, all

 



     

 

 



 

actions and steps requested or required by any Governmental Body as a
condition to granting any consent, permit, authorization, waiver, clearance or
approval, and to cause the prompt expiration or termination of any applicable
waiting period and to resolve objections, if any, as the FTC or DOJ, or other
Governmental Bodies of any other jurisdiction for which consents, permits,
authorizations, waivers, clearances, approvals and expirations or terminations
of waiting periods are sought with respect to the Transactions, so as to
obtain such consents, permits, authorizations, waivers, clearances, approvals
or termination of the waiting period under the HSR Act or other Antitrust
Laws, and to avoid the commencement of a lawsuit by the FTC, the DOJ or other
Governmental Bodies under Antitrust Laws, and to avoid the entry of, or to
effect the dissolution of, any injunction, temporary restraining order or
other order in any suit or proceeding which would otherwise have the effect of
preventing the Closing or materially delaying the Offer Acceptance Time or the
Closing or delaying the Offer Acceptance Time beyond the Expiration Date.

 



 

 **(c)** Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, each of the
Parties hereto shall (and shall cause their respective Affiliates, if
applicable, to): (i) promptly, but in no event later than ten (10) Business
Days after the Agreement Date, make an appropriate filing of all Notification
and Report forms as required by the HSR Act with respect to the Transactions
and (ii) cooperate with each other in determining whether, and promptly
preparing and making, any other filings or notifications or other consents
required to be made with, or obtained from, any other Governmental Bodies in
connection with the Transactions.

 



 

 **(d)** Without limiting the generality of anything contained in this
_Section 7.2_, during the Pre-Closing Period, each Party hereto shall use its
reasonable best efforts to (i) reasonably cooperate in all respects and
consult with each other in connection with any filing or submission in
connection with any investigation or other inquiry, including allowing the
other Party to have a reasonable opportunity to review in advance and comment
on drafts of filings and submissions and providing the other Party with any
information that may be necessary to prepare any such filings and submissions,
(ii) give the other Parties prompt notice of the making or commencement of any
request, inquiry, investigation, action or Legal Proceeding brought by a
Governmental Body or brought by a third party before any Governmental Body, in
each case, with respect to the Transactions, (iii) keep the other Parties
informed as to the status of any such request, inquiry, investigation, action
or Legal Proceeding, (iv) promptly inform the other Parties of any
communication to or from the FTC, DOJ or any other Governmental Body in
connection with any such request, inquiry, investigation, action or Legal
Proceeding, (v) upon request, promptly furnish to the other Party, subject to
an appropriate confidentiality agreement to limit disclosure to outside
counsel and consultants retained by such counsel, with copies of documents
provided to or received from any Governmental Body in connection with any such
request, inquiry, investigation, action or Legal Proceeding, (vi) subject to
an appropriate confidentiality agreement to limit disclosure to counsel and
outside consultants retained by such counsel, consult in advance and cooperate
with the other Parties and consider in good faith the views of the other
Parties in connection with any substantive communication, analysis,
appearance, presentation, memorandum, brief, argument, opinion or proposal to
be made or submitted in connection with any such request, inquiry,
investigation, action or Legal Proceeding, and (vii) except as may be
prohibited by any Governmental Body or by any Law, in connection with any such
request, inquiry, investigation, action or Legal Proceeding in respect of the
Transactions, each Party hereto shall provide advance notice of and permit
authorized Representatives of the other Party to be

 



     

 

 



 

present at each meeting or conference relating to such request, inquiry,
investigation, action or Legal Proceeding and to have access to and be
consulted in advance in connection with any argument, opinion or proposal to
be made or submitted to any Governmental Body in connection with such request,
inquiry, investigation, action or Legal Proceeding; _provided, however_ , that
materials required to provided pursuant to this _Section 7.2(d)_ may be
redacted (A) to remove references concerning the valuation of Parent,
Purchaser, Company, or any of their respective Subsidiaries or assets and (B)
as necessary to address reasonable privilege or confidentiality concerns;
_provided, further_ that the Party shall use commercially reasonable efforts
to otherwise address such privilege or confidentiality concerns (including
using commercially reasonable efforts to obtain the consent of a third party
to provide such materials) prior to redaction of such materials. Each Party
shall supply as promptly as practicable such information, documentation, other
material or testimony that may be reasonably requested by any Governmental
Body, including by complying at the earliest reasonably practicable date with
any reasonable request for additional information, documents or other
materials received by any Party or any of their respective Subsidiaries from
any Governmental Body in connection with such applications or filings for the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Purchaser shall pay all filing
fees under the HSR Act and for any filings required under foreign Antitrust
Laws, but the Company shall bear its own costs for the preparation of any such
filings. Neither Party shall commit to or agree with any Governmental Body to
stay, toll or extend any applicable waiting period under the HSR Act, or pull
and refile under the HSR Act, or other applicable Antitrust Laws, without the
prior written consent of the other.

 



 

 **(e)** Before the Closing, each of Purchaser, Parent the Company and their
respective controlled Affiliates shall not, directly or indirectly, acquire or
agree to acquire any assets, business or any Person, whether by merger,
consolidation, purchasing a portion of the assets of or equity in any Person
or by any other manner or engage in any other similar transaction if the
entering into of any agreement relating to or the consummation of such
acquisition, merger, consolidation, purchase or other similar transaction
would reasonably be expected to (i) impose any material delay in the
expiration or termination of any applicable waiting period or impose any
material delay in the obtaining of, or materially increase the risk of not
obtaining, any authorization, consent, clearance, approval or order of a
Governmental Body necessary to consummate the Offer, the Merger and the other
Transactions, including any approvals and expiration of waiting periods
pursuant to the HSR Act or any other applicable Law, (ii) increase the risk of
any Governmental Body entering, or increase the risk of not being able to
remove or successfully challenge, any permanent, preliminary or temporary
injunction or other order, decree, decision, determination or judgment that
would materially delay, restrain, prevent, enjoin or otherwise prohibit
consummation of the Offer, the Merger and the other Transactions or (iii)
otherwise materially delay or impede the consummation of the Offer, the Merger
and the other Transactions.

 



 

 **7.3** **Employee Benefits**. Parent agrees that from and after the
Effective Time, Parent shall or shall cause the Surviving Corporation to
assume and honor all individual severance and employment agreements for all
Continuing Employees (as defined below), in each case, in accordance with
their terms as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time. For a period
of one (1) year following the Effective Time, Parent shall provide, or cause
to be provided, to each employee of the Company who is employed by the Company
as of immediately prior to the Effective Time and who continues to be employed
by the Surviving Corporation (or any Affiliate

 



     

 

 



 

thereof) during such one-year period (each, a " ** _Continuing Employee_** ")
base salary (or base wages, as the case may be) and short-term cash incentive
compensation opportunities (including, but not limited to, bonuses and
commission opportunities), each of which is no less favorable than the base
salary (or base wages, as the case may be) and short-term cash incentive
compensation opportunities provided to such Continuing Employee immediately
prior to the Effective Time, and other employee benefits (including severance
benefits) that are substantially similar in the aggregate to the employee
benefits (including severance benefits) provided to such Continuing Employee
immediately prior to the Effective Time. Without limiting the foregoing:

 



 

 **(a)** Each Continuing Employee shall be given service credit for all
purposes, including for eligibility to participate, benefit levels (including,
for the avoidance of doubt, levels of benefits under Parents or the Surviving
Corporations vacation policy) and eligibility for vesting under Parent or the
Surviving Corporations employee benefit plans and arrangements with respect
to his or her length of service with the Company (and its Subsidiaries and
predecessors) prior to the Closing Date, provided, that the foregoing shall
not result in the duplication of benefits or apply to any defined benefit
pension plan or post-retirement medical plan.

 



 

 **(b)** With respect to any accrued but unused personal, sick or vacation
time to which any Continuing Employee is entitled pursuant to the personal,
sick or vacation policies applicable to such Continuing Employee immediately
prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall, or shall cause the Surviving
Corporation to and instruct its Affiliates to, as applicable (and without
duplication of benefits), assume the liability for such accrued personal, sick
or vacation time and allow such Continuing Employee to use such accrued
personal, sick or vacation time in accordance with the practice and policies
of the Company.

 



 

 **(c)** To the extent that service is relevant for eligibility, vesting or
allowances (including paid time off) under any health or welfare benefit plan
of Parent or the Surviving Corporation in which any Continuing Employee is
eligible to participate after the Effective Time, then Parent shall (i) waive
all limitations as to pre-existing conditions, exclusions and waiting periods
with respect to participation and coverage requirements applicable to the
Continuing Employees, to the extent that such conditions, exclusions and
waiting periods would not apply under a similar employee benefit plan in which
such employees participated prior to the Effective Time and (ii) use
reasonable best efforts to ensure that such health or welfare benefit plan
shall, for purposes of eligibility, vesting, deductibles, co-payments and out-
of-pocket maximums and allowances (including paid time off), credit Continuing
Employees for service and amounts paid prior to the Effective Time with the
Company to the same extent that such service and amounts paid were recognized
prior to the Effective Time under the corresponding health or welfare benefit
plan of the Company. For the avoidance of doubt, Parent shall use reasonable
best efforts to cause any eligible expenses incurred by a Continuing Employee
and his or her covered dependents during the portion of the plan year
immediately before the Effective Time to be taken into account for purposes of
satisfying all deductible, coinsurance and maximum out-of-pocket requirements
applicable to such Continuing Employee and his or her covered dependents for
the applicable plan year as if such amounts had been paid in accordance with
the applicable health or welfare benefit plan of Parent or the Surviving
Corporation.

 



 

 **(d)** The Company shall make available to Parent a final, true, correct and
complete version of the Employee Census no later than ten (10) days prior to
the Effective Time.

 



     

 

 



 

 **(e)** The provisions of this _Section 7.3 _are solely for the benefit of
the Parties to this Agreement, and no provision of this _Section 7.3_ is
intended to, or shall, constitute the establishment or adoption of or an
amendment to any employee benefit plan for purposes of ERISA or otherwise and
no other Person (including any current or former employee or any other
individual associated therewith) shall be regarded for any purpose as a third
party beneficiary of this Agreement or have the right to enforce the
provisions hereof. Nothing in this Agreement shall be deemed to be a guarantee
of continued employment to any employee of any Acquired Corporation.

 



 

 **7.4** **Indemnification of Officers and Directors**.

 



 

 **(a)** All rights to indemnification, advancement of expenses and
exculpation by the Company existing as of the Agreement Date (or pursuant to
any Contract entered into after the execution of this Agreement with Parents
prior written consent) in favor of those Persons who are directors and
officers of any Acquired Corporation as of the Agreement Date or have been
directors and officers of any Acquired Corporation in the past (the " **
_Indemnified Persons_** ") for their acts and omissions occurring prior to the
Effective Time, as provided in the certificate of incorporation and bylaws (or
applicable governing documents) of the applicable Acquired Corporation (as in
effect as of the Agreement Date) and as provided in the indemnification
agreements between the Acquired Corporation and said Indemnified Persons set
forth in Section 7.4 of the Company Disclosure Letter and made available by
the Company to Parent or Parents Representatives prior to the Agreement Date,
shall survive the Merger and shall not be amended, repealed or otherwise
modified in any manner that would adversely affect the rights thereunder of
such Indemnified Persons, and shall be observed by the Surviving Corporation
and its Subsidiaries to the fullest extent available under Delaware law for a
period of six years from the Effective Time, and any claim made pursuant to
such rights within such six-year period shall continue to be subject to this
_Section 7.4(a)_ and the rights provided under this _Section 7.4(a)_ until
disposition of such claim.

 



 

 **(b)** From and after the Effective Time until the sixth anniversary of the
date on which the Effective Time occurs, the Surviving Corporation (together
with its successors and assigns, the " ** _Indemnifying Parties_** ") shall,
to the fullest extent permitted under applicable Law, indemnify and hold
harmless each Indemnified Person in his or her capacity as an officer or
director of an Acquired Corporation against all losses, claims, damages,
liabilities, fees, expenses, judgments or fines incurred by such Indemnified
Person as an officer or director of an Acquired Corporation in connection with
any pending or threatened Legal Proceeding based on or arising out of, in
whole or in part, the fact that such Indemnified Person is or was a director
or officer of an Acquired Corporation at or prior to the Effective Time and
pertaining to any and all matters pending, existing or occurring at or prior
to the Effective Time, whether asserted or claimed prior to, at or after the
Effective Time, including any such matter arising under any claim with respect
to the transactions contemplated herein. Without limiting the foregoing, from
the Effective Time until the sixth anniversary of the date on which the
Effective Time occurs, the Indemnifying Parties shall also, to the fullest
extent permitted under applicable Laws, advance reasonable and documented out-
of-pocket costs and expenses (including reasonable and documented attorneys
fees) incurred by the Indemnified Persons in connection with matters for which
such Indemnified Persons are eligible to be indemnified pursuant to this
_Section 7.4(b)_, subject to the execution by such Indemnified Persons of
appropriate undertakings in favor of the Indemnifying Parties to repay such
advanced costs and expenses if it is ultimately determined in a final and non-
appealable judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction that such Indemnified
Person is not entitled to be

 



     

 

 



 

indemnified under this _Section 7.4(b)_. Parent shall cause the Surviving
Corporation to comply with its obligations under this _Section 7.4(b)_.

 



 

 **(c)** From the Effective Time until the sixth anniversary of the Effective
Time, the Surviving Corporation shall maintain, and Parent shall cause the
Surviving Corporation to maintain, in effect, the current policy of directors
and officers liability insurance maintained by the Acquired Corporations as
of the Agreement Date for the benefit of the Indemnified Persons who are
currently covered by such existing policy with respect to their acts and
omissions occurring prior to the Effective Time in their capacities as
directors and officers of the Company (as applicable), on terms with respect
to coverage, deductibles and amounts no less favorable in the aggregate than
the existing policy (or at or prior to the Effective Time Parent or the
Company may (through a nationally recognized insurance broker approved by
Parent (such approval not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or
delayed)) purchase a six-year "tail" policy for the existing policy effective
as of the Effective Time) and if such "tail policy" has been obtained, it
shall be deemed to satisfy all obligations to obtain or maintain insurance
pursuant to this _Section 7.4(c)_; _provided, however,_ that in no event
shall the Surviving Corporation be required to, and without Parents consent
the Company may not, expend in any one (1) year an amount in excess of 300% of
the annual premium currently payable by the Company with respect to such
current policy, it being understood that if the annual premiums payable for
such insurance coverage exceeds such amount, Parent shall be obligated to
cause the Surviving Corporation to obtain a policy with the greatest coverage
available for a cost equal to such amount.

 



 

 **(d)** In the event Parent or the Surviving Corporation or any of their
respective successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any
other Person and shall not be the continuing or surviving corporation or
Entity of such consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers all or substantially
all of its properties and assets to any Person, then, and in each such case,
Parent shall ensure that the successors and assigns of Parent or the Surviving
Corporation, as the case may be, or at Parents option, Parent, shall assume
the obligations set forth in this _Section 7.4_.

 



 

 **(e)** The provisions of this _Section 7.4_ shall survive the acceptance of
Shares for payment pursuant to the Offer and the consummation of the Merger
and are (i) intended to be for the benefit of, and shall be enforceable by,
each of the Indemnified Persons and their successors, assigns and heirs and
(ii) in addition to, and not in substitution for, any other rights to
indemnification or contribution that any such Person may have by contract or
otherwise. This _Section 7.4_ may not be amended, altered or repealed after
the Offer Acceptance Time in such a manner as to adversely affect the rights
of any Indemnified Person or any of their successors, assigns or heirs without
the prior written consent of the affected Indemnified Person.

 



 

 **7.5** **Securityholder Litigation**. The Company shall promptly notify
Parent of any Legal Proceeding against the Company or any of its directors or
officers relating to the Transactions and shall keep Parent apprised on a
prompt basis of any material developments with respect to any such Legal
Proceeding. The Company shall give Parent the right to review and comment on
all material filings or responses to be made by the Company in connection with
any such Legal Proceeding (and the Company shall in good faith take such
comments and other advice into account), and the right to consult in the
defense and on any settlement with respect to any such Legal Proceeding, and
the Company shall in good faith take such consultation into account. No

 



      

 

 



 

such settlement shall be agreed to without Parents prior written consent
(such consent not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed).

 



 

 **7.6** **Additional Agreements**. Without limitation or contravention of the
provisions of _Section 7.2_, and subject to the terms and conditions of this
Agreement, Parent and the Company shall use commercially reasonable efforts to
take, or cause to be taken, all actions necessary to consummate the Offer and
the Merger and make effective the other Transactions. Without limiting the
generality of the foregoing, subject to the terms and conditions of this
Agreement, each Party will (a) make all filings (if any) and give all notices
(if any) required to be made and given by such Party in connection with the
Offer and the Merger and the other Transactions, (b) use commercially
reasonable efforts to obtain each Consent (if any) required to be obtained
pursuant to any applicable Law or Material Contract by such Party in
connection with the Transactions, in each case, to the extent requested by
Parent in writing ( _provided that_ , in the case of this clause (b), in no
event shall any Party be required to pay any fee, penalty or other
consideration to any third party for any consent or approval required for the
consummation of the Transactions under any Contract) and (c) use commercially
reasonable efforts to lift any restraint, injunction or other legal bar to the
Offer or the Merger brought by any third Person against such Party. The
Company shall promptly deliver to Parent a copy of each such filing made, each
such notice given and each such Consent obtained by the Company during the
Pre-Closing Period.

 



 

 **7.7** **Disclosure**. The initial press release relating to this Agreement
shall be a joint press release issued by the Company and Parent and thereafter
Parent and the Company shall consult with each other before issuing any
further press release(s) or otherwise making any public statement (to the
extent not previously issued or made in accordance with this Agreement) with
respect to the Offer, the Merger, this Agreement or any of the other
Transactions and shall not issue any such press release or public statement
without the other Partys written consent (which shall not be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned or delayed). Notwithstanding the foregoing: (a) each
Party may, without such consultation or consent, make any public statement in
response to questions from the press, analysts, investors or those attending
industry conferences, make internal announcements to employees and make
disclosures in its filings under applicable securities Laws, so long as such
statements are consistent with previous press releases, public disclosures or
public statements made jointly by the Parties (or individually, if approved by
the other Party); (b) a Party may, without the prior consent of the other
Party hereto but subject to giving advance notice to the other Party, issue
any such press release or make any such public announcement or statement as
may be required by any Law; (c) the Company need not consult with Parent in
connection with such portion of any press release, public statement or filing
to be issued or made pursuant to _Section 6.3(d)_; and (d) no Party shall be
required to consult with any other Party in connection with such portion of

would reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a
Parent Material Adverse Effect or (B) is reasonably likely to result in any of
the conditions set forth in _Section 8_ not being able to be satisfied prior

pursuant to this _Section 7.8(b)_ shall be deemed excluded for purposes of
determining whether the condition set forth in _clause (c)_ of **Annex I**

on its part under applicable laws and rules and policies of Nasdaq to enable
the delisting by the Surviving Corporation of the Shares from Nasdaq and the
deregistration of the Shares under the Exchange Act as promptly as practicable
after the Effective Time.

 



 

 **7.13** **Financing**.

 



 

 **(a)** Parent and Purchaser acknowledge and agree that prior to the
Effective Time and except as expressly provided in this _Section 7.13_, the
Company and, at all times, its Affiliates and its and their respective
Representatives shall not have any responsibility for, or incur any liability
to any Person under, any financing that Parent and Purchaser may raise in
connection with the Transactions. Parent and Purchaser shall, on a joint and
several basis, indemnify and hold harmless the Company and its Affiliates and
its and their respective Representatives from and against, and compensate and
reimburse the Company and its Affiliates and its and their respective
Representatives for, any and all losses, damages, claims, costs or expenses
suffered or incurred by any of them in connection with the Financing (except
to the extent that such loss, damage, claim, cost or expense arises from
material misstatements or omissions in information provided by or on behalf of
the Company, any of its Affiliates or any of their respective Representatives
in connection with the Financing). Parent shall promptly, upon request of the
Company, reimburse the Acquired Corporations for all reasonable and documented
out-of-pocket costs incurred by the Acquired Corporations in connection with
_Section 7.13(g)_.

 



 

 **(b)** Each of Parent and Purchaser shall use its reasonable best efforts to
do, or cause to be done, all things necessary to arrange and obtain the
proceeds of the Financing as promptly as reasonably practicable on the terms
and conditions described in the Commitment Letter, including by using
reasonable best efforts to (i) maintain in effect the Commitment Letter,
subject to the modifications expressly permitted hereunder, (ii) negotiate as
promptly as possible, and enter into, definitive agreements relating to the
Financing at the Closing, (iii) satisfy and to cause their respective
Representatives to satisfy, on a timely basis, all conditions applicable to
Parent, Purchaser or their respective Representatives in the Commitment Letter
within their respective control, (iv) consummate the Financing at or prior to
the Closing, (v) enforce its rights under the Commitment Letter and the
Financing Agreements and (vi) at the written request of the Company, request
written confirmation from the Financing Sources that the Financing will be
funded in accordance with the terms of the Financing. Parent shall keep the
Company reasonably informed of the status of its efforts to arrange the
Financing.

 



 

 **(c)** Parent and Purchaser shall not agree to, or permit, without the prior
written consent of the Company, any assignment, amendment, supplement or
modification to be made to, replacement, restatement or substitution of, or
any waiver by Parent or Purchaser of any provision or remedy under, the
Commitment Letter (including with respect to any alternative financing
intended to replace or be substituted for, in whole or in part, any portion of
the Financing) if such assignment, amendment, supplement, modification,
replacement, restatement, substitution or waiver (i) reduces the aggregate
principal amount or the net cash proceeds of the Financing (after netting or
payment of all fees, expenses and other amounts) to be funded on the Closing
Date unless the Financing, alternative financing permitted in accordance
herewith or cash on hand is increased by a corresponding amount (or Purchaser
may draw upon an available revolving credit facility to fund an amount equal
to such reduction), (ii) imposes new or additional conditions precedent or
otherwise expands, amends or modifies any of the conditions precedent to the
receipt

 



     

 

 



 

of the Financing, in each case to the extent that doing so would reasonably be
expected to prevent, materially impede or delay the consummation of the
Financing or (iii) adversely affects the ability of Parent or Purchaser to
enforce their respective rights against other parties to the Commitment
Letter. For the avoidance of doubt, Parent and Purchaser may amend, modify,
assign, supplement, substitute, replace or restate the Commitment Letter to
add lenders, lead arrangers, bookrunners, syndication agents and similar
entities, in each case subject to the foregoing clauses (i) through (iii) of
the immediately preceding sentence.

 



 

 **(d)** In the event that any portion of the Financing becomes unavailable in
the manner or from the sources contemplated in the Commitment Letter for any
reason whatsoever (other than as the result of any financing that replaces or
is substituted for, in whole or in part, any portion of the Financing pursuant
to any replacement or substitution Commitment Letter in accordance with the
requirements of _Section 7.13(c)_ above), (i) Parent shall promptly so notify
the Company and (ii) Parent and Purchaser shall use reasonable best efforts to
arrange and obtain, and negotiate and enter into commitment letters or
definitive agreements with respect to, alternative financing in an amount
sufficient, when added to the portion of the Financing (if any) and cash on
hand that is available and will be funded at or prior to Closing, to
consummate the Transactions and to pay all related fees and expenses upon
terms and conditions not materially less favorable, taken as a whole, to
Parent and Purchaser (as determined by Parent in good faith) and to the
Company (solely with respect to conditionality) than those in the Commitment
Letter, as promptly as practicable following the occurrence of such event (and
in any event no later than the Closing Date). The definitive agreements
entered into pursuant to _Section 7.13(b)_ or the first sentence of this
_Section 7.13(d)_, are referred to in this Agreement, collectively, as the "
** _Financing Agreements_**."

 



 

 **(e)** Each of Parent and Purchaser acknowledges and agrees that neither the
obtaining of the Financing or any alternative financing, nor the completion of
any issuance of securities contemplated by any alternative financing, is a
condition to the Closing, and reaffirms its obligation to consummate the
Transactions irrespective and independently of the availability of the
Financing or any alternative financing, or the completion of any such
issuance, subject only to the satisfaction of the applicable conditions set
forth in _Section 8_ and **Annex I**.

 



 

 **(f)** Parent and Purchaser shall (i) give the Company written notice of (A)
any material default or breach or threatened (in writing) material default or
breach by any party of the Commitment Letter of which Parent or Purchaser
becomes aware or any termination or threatened (in writing) termination
thereof, (B) the receipt of any written notice or other written communication,
in each case from any Financing Source or any Affiliate thereof with respect
to any actual or potential breach, default, termination or repudiation by any
party to the Commitment Letter or Financing Agreements or any material dispute
or disagreement between or among any parties to the Commitment Letter or
Financing Agreements with respect to the obligation to fund the Financing or
the amount of the Financing to be funded at Closing, (ii) give the Company
written notice if for any reason Parent or Purchaser believes in good faith
that it will not be able to obtain all or any portion of the Financing on the
terms and conditions, in the manner or from the sources contemplated by the
Commitment Letter or Financing Agreements and (iii) keep the Company
reasonably informed with respect to all material activity concerning the
status of the Financing.

 



     

 

 



 

 **(g)** The Company shall use its reasonable best efforts, and shall cause
the other Acquired Corporations to use reasonable best efforts, and shall use
its reasonable best efforts to cause the Representatives of the Acquired
Corporations to, at Parents sole expense, cooperate with Parent in connection
with the arrangement of the Financing as may be reasonably requested by Parent
in connection with the arrangement of the Financing ( _provided_ that such
cooperation does not unreasonably interfere with the ongoing operations of the
Acquired Corporations), such reasonable best efforts to include, (i)
reasonably facilitating the granting of a security interest (and perfection
thereof) in collateral, and the preparation, execution and delivery of
guarantees, mortgages, other definitive financing documents or other
certificates or documents as may reasonably be requested by Parent, including
obtaining releases of existing Encumbrances (to the extent required in the
Commitment Letter); _provided_ that all of the foregoing, including any
obligations and releases of Encumbrances contained in all such agreements and
documents, shall be subject to the occurrence of the Closing and become
effective no earlier than immediately following the Closing, (ii) providing a
certificate of the chief financial officer or person performing similar
functions of the Company in the form attached to the Commitment Letter with
respect to solvency matters and providing customary authorization letters with
respect to the bank information memoranda at the Closing, (iii) furnishing all
documentation and other information reasonably requested in writing required
by a Governmental Body under applicable "know your customer" and anti-money
laundering rules and regulations, including the USA PATRIOT Act of 2001, but
in each case, solely as relating to the Acquired Corporations, (iv) furnishing
Parent and Purchaser such other pertinent financial and other customary
information relating to the Acquired Corporations as Parent, Purchaser or any
Financing Source shall reasonably request, (v) obtaining customary payoff
letters and any necessary lien terminations and other instruments of discharge
in connection with repayment of existing indebtedness of the Acquired
Corporations reasonably requested by Parent and Purchaser, (vi) taking all
customary corporate, limited liability company or similar administrative or
organizational actions reasonably necessary to permit the consummation of the
Financing, (vii) preventing the offer, placement or arrangement of any debt
securities or bank or other credit facilities (except as expressly permitted
by _Section 6.2_) by or on behalf of any Acquired Corporation, (viii)
cooperating with the marketing efforts of Parent, Purchaser and the Financing
Sources in respect of the Financing and (ix) reasonably assisting in the
preparation, execution and delivery of one or more credit agreements,
indentures, purchase agreements, pledge and security documents and other
definitive financing documents as may be reasonably requested by Parent;
_provided_ that all of the foregoing in this clause (ix) shall be subject to
the occurrence of the Closing and become effective no earlier than immediately
following the Closing. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the
contrary, nothing in this Agreement shall require any cooperation to the
extent that it would require any Acquired Corporation to (i) waive, breach or
amend any terms of this Agreement, (ii) pay or agree to pay any commitment or
other fees or pay, incur or reimburse any expenses prior to the Effective Time
(except, in each case, to the extent subject to concurrent reimbursement by
Parent), (iii) approve the execution or delivery of any document or
certificate in connection with the Financing (or any alternative financing)
prior to the Effective Time, (iv) take any action that would conflict with,
violate or result in a breach of or default under any organizational documents
of the Company or of any of its Affiliates or any applicable Law, (v) require
providing access to or disclose information that the Company determines on the
advice of outside counsel would jeopardize any attorney client privilege of,
or conflict with any confidentiality requirements (to the extent not entered
into in contemplation of the Offer or the Merger) applicable to, the Company (
_provided_ that the Company

 



     

 

 



 

shall use its reasonable best efforts to inform Parent that such information
is being withheld, but solely if providing such notice would not violate such
obligation of confidentiality), or (vi) require any director or manager of the
Company (or any Subsidiary, to the extent the board of directors, managers or
members will be changing in connection with, or as a result of, the Offer, the
Merger and the other Transactions) to pass resolutions or consents to approve
or authorize the execution of the Financing or the Financing Agreements (and
in the case of any Subsidiary whose board of directors, managers or members
will not be changing in connection with, or as a result of, the Transactions,
no such resolutions or consents shall be deemed executed or effective until
the Effective Time), in each case for this clause (vi) that are not contingent
on the Closing or would be effective prior to Closing.

 



 

 **(h)** The Company hereby consents to the use of all logos of the Acquired
Corporations in connection with the Financing so long as such logos (i) are
used solely in a manner that is not intended to or likely to harm or disparage
any of the Acquired Corporations or the reputation or goodwill of any of the
Acquired Corporations and (ii) are used solely in connection with a
description of the Company, its business and products or the Transactions.

 



 

 **SECTION 8.** **CONDITIONS PRECEDENT TO THE MERGER**

 



 

The obligations of the Parties to effect the Merger are subject to the
satisfaction, at or prior to the Closing, of each of the following conditions:

 



 

 **8.1** **No Restraints**. There shall not have been issued by any
Governmental Body of competent jurisdiction and remain in effect any judgment,
temporary restraining order, preliminary or permanent injunction or other
order preventing the consummation of the Merger, nor shall any action have
been taken, or Law or order have been promulgated, entered, enforced, enacted,
issued or deemed applicable to the Merger by any Governmental Body which
directly or indirectly prohibits, or makes illegal, the consummation of the
Merger.

 



 

 **8.2** **Consummation of Offer**. Purchaser (or Parent on Purchasers
behalf) shall have irrevocably accepted for payment all of the Shares validly
tendered pursuant to the Offer and not validly withdrawn.

 **9.1** **Termination**. This Agreement may be terminated prior to the Offer
Acceptance Time:

 



 

 **(a)** by mutual written consent of Parent and the Company;

 



 

 **(b)** by either Parent or the Company, if (A) the Offer Acceptance Time
shall not have occurred on or before midnight, Eastern Time, on December 31,
2019 (the " ** _End Date_** ") or (B) the Offer is terminated or withdrawn in
accordance with _Section 2.1(c)_ of this Agreement without any Shares being
purchased thereunder; _provided, however,_ that neither Parent nor the Company
shall be permitted to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this _Section
9.1(b)_ in the event that such Partys material breach of any provision of
this Agreement has caused or resulted in the events specified in this _Section
9.1(b)_ occurring;

 



     

 

 



 

 **(c)** by either Parent or the Company, if a court of competent jurisdiction
or other Governmental Body shall have issued an order, decree or ruling,
having the effect of permanently restraining, enjoining or otherwise
prohibiting the acceptance for payment of Shares pursuant to the Offer or the
Merger or making consummation of the Offer or the Merger illegal, which order,
decree or ruling shall be final and nonappealable; _provided, however,_
neither Parent nor the Company shall be permitted to terminate this Agreement
pursuant to this _Section 9.1(c)_ in the event that such Partys material
breach of any provision of this Agreement shall have been the cause of, or
resulted in, the issuance of such final and nonappealable order, decree or
ruling;

 



 

 **(d)** by Parent if: the Company Board has not included the Company Board
Recommendation in the Schedule 14D-9 when disseminated to the holders of
Shares, or shall have effected a Company Adverse Change Recommendation
(whether or not in compliance with _Section 7.1_);

concurrently with such termination enter into a binding written definitive
acquisition agreement providing for the consummation of a transaction
constituting a Superior Offer (a " ** _Specified Agreement_** "); _provided_
that the Company (i) has complied in all material respects with the
requirements of _Sections 6.3_ and _7.1(a)_ and _7.1(b)(i)_ with respect to
such Superior Offer and (ii) prior to or concurrently with (and as a condition
to) such termination, has paid the Termination Fee to Parent (or its
designee);

 



 

 **(f)** by Parent if a breach of any representation or warranty contained in
Section 4 of this Agreement or failure to perform any covenant or obligation
in this Agreement on the part of the Company shall have occurred such that the
condition set forth in any of clauses "(b)", "(c)" or "(d)" of **Annex I**
would not be satisfied and cannot be cured by the Company by the End Date, or
if capable of being cured by the End Date, shall not have been cured within
thirty (30) days of the date Parent gives the Company written notice of such
breach or failure to perform; _provided, however,_ that Parent shall not have
the right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this _Section 9.1(f)_ if
either Parent or Purchaser is then in material breach of any representation,
warranty, covenant or obligation hereunder;

 



 

 **(g)** by the Company if a breach of any representation or warranty
contained in Section 5 of this Agreement or failure to perform any covenant or
obligation in this Agreement on the part of Parent or Purchaser shall have
occurred, in each case if such breach or failure has prevented or would
reasonably be expected to prevent Parent or Purchaser from consummating the
Offer or the Merger pursuant to this Agreement and such breach or failure
cannot be cured by Parent or Purchaser, as applicable, by the End Date, or if
capable of being cured by the End Date, shall not have been cured within
thirty (30) days of the date the Company gives Parent written notice of such
breach or failure to perform; _provided, however,_ that the Company shall not
have the right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this _Section 9.1(g)_
if the Company is then in material breach of any representation, warranty,
covenant or obligation hereunder; or

 



 

 **(h)** by the Company if Purchaser has not commenced (within the meaning of
Rule 14d-2 under the Exchange Act) the Offer within the period specified in
_Section 2.1(a)_ or if Purchaser shall have failed to accept for payment and
pay for all Shares validly tendered (and not validly withdrawn) when required
to do so in accordance with the terms of this Agreement;

 



     

 

 



 

 _provided, however,_ that the Company shall not be permitted to terminate
this Agreement pursuant to this _Section 9.1(h)_ in the event that
Purchasers failure to commence the Offer is primarily due to the Companys
material breach of this Agreement.

 



 

 **9.2** **Effect of Termination**. In the event of the termination of this
Agreement as provided in _Section 9.1_, written notice thereof shall be given
to the other Party or Parties, specifying the provision hereof pursuant to
which such termination is made, and this Agreement shall be of no further
force or effect and there shall be no liability on the part of Parent,
Purchaser or the Company or their respective directors, officers and
Affiliates following any such termination; _provided, however,_ that (a) this
_Section 9.2_, _Section 2.1(d)_, _Section 2.2(b)_, _Section 6.1_, _Section
7.13(a)_, _Section 9.3_ and _Section 10_ shall survive the termination of
this Agreement and shall remain in full force and effect, (b) the
Confidentiality Agreement shall survive the termination of this Agreement and
shall remain in full force and effect in accordance with its terms and (c)
subject to _Section 9.3(b)_, the termination of this Agreement shall not

the date of termination. Nothing herein shall limit or prevent any Party from
exercising any rights or remedies it may have under _Section 10.5(b)_ in lieu
of terminating this Agreement pursuant to _Section 9.1_.

 



 

 **9.3** **Expenses; Termination Fee**.

 



 

 **(a)** Except as set forth in this _Section 9.3_, all fees and expenses
incurred in connection with this Agreement and the Transactions shall be paid
by the Party incurring such expenses, whether or not the Offer and Merger are
consummated.

 



 

 **(b)** In the event that:

 



 

 **(i)** this Agreement is terminated by the Company in accordance with
_Section 9.1(e)_;

 



 

 **(ii)** this Agreement is terminated by Parent in accordance with _Section
9.1(d)_; or

 



 

 **(iii)** (A) this Agreement is terminated pursuant to _Section 9.1(b)_ (but
in the case of a termination by the Company, only if at such time Parent would
not be prohibited from terminating this Agreement pursuant to the proviso of
_Section 9.1(b)_), (B) after the Agreement Date and prior to such
termination, any Person (other than Parent or any of its Affiliates) shall
have publicly disclosed an Acquisition Proposal or an Acquisition Proposal
becomes publicly known and (C) within twelve (12) months of such termination,
the Company shall have entered into a definitive agreement in respect of an
Acquisition Proposal or consummated an Acquisition Proposal ( _provided_ that
for purposes of this clause (C), the references to "20%" in the definition of
" ** _Acquisition Proposal_** " shall be deemed to be references to "50%" and
the reference to "license of assets" in the definition of " ** _Acquisition
Proposal_** " shall be deemed to be "license of assets in the U.S." unless the
Acquisition Proposal referred to in clause (B) constitutes the basis for, or
is substantially similar to, the Acquisition Proposal referred to in clause
(C), in which case the reference to "license of assets" shall not be modified
in any respect).

 



 

then, in any such event under clause "(i)", "(ii)" or "(iii)" of this _Section
9.3(b)_, the Company shall pay, or shall cause to be paid, to Parent or its
designee the Termination Fee by wire transfer of

 



     

 

 



 

same day funds to an account designed in writing by Parent (x) in the case of
_Section 9.3(b)(i)_, substantially concurrently with (and as a condition to)
such termination, (y) in the case of _Section 9.3(b)(ii)_, within two (2)
Business Days after such termination or (z) in the case of _Section
9.3(b)(iii)_, prior to or substantially concurrently with the execution of the
definitive agreement or the consummation of the Acquisition Proposal referred
to in subclause (C) of _Section 9.3(b)(iii),_ whichever is earlier; it being
understood that in no event shall the Company be required to pay the
Termination Fee on more than one occasion. As used herein, "Termination Fee"
means a cash amount equal to $32,000,000. In the event that Parent or its
designee shall receive full payment of the Termination Fee pursuant to this
_Section 9.3(b)_ and any payments pursuant to _Section 9.3(c)_, the receipt
of the Termination Fee and any payments pursuant to _Section 9.3(c)_ shall be
deemed to be liquidated damages for any and all losses or damages suffered or
incurred by Parent, Purchaser, any of their respective Affiliates and
Representatives or any other Person in connection with this Agreement (and the
termination hereof), the Transactions (and the abandonment thereof) or any
matter forming the basis for such termination, and none of Parent, Purchaser,
any of their respective Affiliates and Representatives (collectively, " **
_Parent Related Parties_** ") or any other Person shall be entitled to bring
or maintain any claim, action or proceeding against the Company or any of its
Affiliates or any of its Representatives arising out of, relating to, or in
connection with this Agreement, any of the Transactions or any matters forming
the basis for such termination; _provided, however_ , that nothing in this
_Section 9.3(b)_ shall limit the rights of Parent or Purchaser under _Section
10.5(b)_ or in the case of Fraud or Willful Breach. Parents right to receive
payment from the Company of the Termination Fee pursuant to _Section 9.3(b)_,
and, if applicable, any payments under _Section 9.3(c)_, shall be the sole
and exclusive remedy of the Parent Related Parties against the Company and any
of their respective former, current or future officers, directors, partners,
stockholders, optionholders, managers, members, Affiliates or Representatives
(collectively, " ** _Company Related Parties_** ") in any circumstance in
which Parent accepts payment of the Termination Fee, and none of the Company
Related Parties shall have any further liability or obligation relating to,
arising out of, or in connection with, this Agreement or the Transactions;
_provided, however_ , that nothing in this _Section 9.3(b)_ shall limit the
rights of Parent or Purchaser under _Section 10.5(b)_ or in the case of Fraud
or Willful Breach.

 



 

 **(c)** The Parties acknowledge that the agreements contained in this
_Section 9.3_ are an integral part of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement and that, without these agreements, the Parties would not enter into
this Agreement; accordingly, if the Company fails to timely pay any amount due
pursuant to this _Section 9.3_, and, in order to obtain the payment, Parent
commences a Legal Proceeding which results in a judgment against the Company,
the Company shall pay Parent its reasonable and documented out-of-pocket costs
and expenses (including reasonable and documented outside attorneys fees) in
connection with such Legal Proceeding, together with interest on such amount
at a rate equal the prime rate as published in the Wall Street Journal on the
date such payment was required to be made, with such interest accruing on such
amount from the date such payment was required to be made through the date
such payment was made to Parent or its designee.

 



 

 **SECTION 10.** **MISCELLANEOUS PROVISIONS**

 



 

 **10.1** **Amendment**. Prior to the Offer Acceptance Time, subject to
_Section 7.4(e)_, this Agreement may be amended with the approval of the
respective Boards of Directors of the

 



     

 

 



 

Company and Parent at any time. This Agreement may not be amended except by an
instrument in writing signed on behalf of each of the Parties.

 



 

 **10.2** **Waiver**. No failure on the part of any Party to exercise any
power, right, privilege or remedy under this Agreement, and no delay on the
part of any Party in exercising any power, right, privilege or remedy under
this Agreement, shall operate as a waiver of such power, right, privilege or
remedy; and no single or partial exercise of any such power, right, privilege
or remedy shall preclude any other or further exercise thereof or of any other
power, right, privilege or remedy. No Party shall be deemed to have waived any
claim arising out of this Agreement, or any power, right, privilege or remedy
under this Agreement, unless the waiver of such claim, power, right, privilege
or remedy is expressly set forth in a written instrument duly executed and
delivered on behalf of such Party; and any such waiver shall not be applicable
or have any effect except in the specific instance in which it is given.

 



 

 **10.3** **No Survival of Representations and Warranties**. None of the
representations and warranties contained in this Agreement or in any
certificate or schedule or other document delivered pursuant to this Agreement
shall survive the Merger.

 



 

 **10.4** **Entire Agreement; Counterparts**. This Agreement, the Support
Agreements, the CVR Agreement and the other agreements and schedules referred
to herein constitute the entire agreement and supersede all contemporaneous
and prior agreements and understandings, both written and oral, among or
between any of the Parties, with respect to the subject matter hereof and
thereof; _provided, however,_ that the Confidentiality Agreement shall not be
superseded and shall remain in full force and effect; _provided, further,_
that if the Effective Time occurs, the Confidentiality Agreement shall
automatically terminate and be of no further force and effect. This Agreement
may be executed in several counterparts, each of which shall be deemed an
original and all of which shall constitute one and the same instrument. The
exchange of a fully executed Agreement (in counterparts or otherwise) by PDF
shall be sufficient to bind the Parties to the terms and conditions of this
Agreement.

 



 

 **10.5** **Applicable Laws; Jurisdiction; Specific Performance; Remedies**.

 



 

 **(a)** This Agreement shall be governed by, and construed in accordance
with, the laws of the State of Delaware, regardless of the laws that might
otherwise govern under applicable principles of conflicts of laws thereof. In
any action or proceeding arising out of or relating to this Agreement or any
of the Transactions: (i) each of the Parties irrevocably and unconditionally
consents and submits to the exclusive jurisdiction and venue of the Court of
Chancery of the State of Delaware and any state appellate court therefrom or,
if such court lacks subject matter jurisdiction, the United States District
Court sitting in New Castle County in the State of Delaware (it being agreed
that the consents to jurisdiction and venue set forth in this _Section
10.5(a)_ shall not constitute general consents to service of process in the
State of Delaware and shall have no effect for any purpose except as provided
in this paragraph and shall not be deemed to confer rights on any Person other
than the Parties hereto); and (ii) each of the Parties irrevocably consents to
service of process by first class certified mail, return receipt requested,
postage prepaid, to the address at which such Party is to receive notice in
accordance with _Section 10.8_. Each of the Parties hereby irrevocably and
unconditionally waives any objection to the laying of venue of any action,
suit or proceeding arising out of this letter agreement or the

 



      

 

 



 

transactions contemplated hereby in the Court of Chancery of the State of
Delaware and any state appellate court therefrom or, if such court lacks
subject matter jurisdiction, the United States District Court sitting in New
Castle County in the State of Delaware, and hereby further irrevocably and
unconditionally waives and agrees not to plead or claim in any such court that
any such action, suit or proceeding brought in any such court has been brought
in an inconvenient forum (including, any claim based on the doctrine of _forum
non conveniens_ or any similar doctrine). The Parties hereto agree that a
final judgment in any such action or proceeding shall be conclusive and may be
enforced in other jurisdictions by suit on the judgment or in any other manner
provided by applicable Laws; _provided, however,_ that nothing in the
foregoing shall restrict any Partys rights to seek any post-judgment relief
regarding, or any appeal from, such final trial court judgment.

 



 

 **(b)** The Parties agree that irreparable damage for which monetary damages,
even if available, would not be an adequate remedy, would occur in the event
that the Parties hereto do not perform their obligations under the provisions
of this Agreement in accordance with its specified terms or otherwise breach
such provisions. Subject to the terms and conditions of this _Section
10.5(b)_, the Parties acknowledge and agree that (i) the Parties shall be
entitled to an injunction or injunctions, specific performance, or other
equitable relief, to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce
specifically the terms and provisions hereof in the courts described in
_Section 10.5(a)_ without proof of damages or otherwise, this being in
addition to any other remedy to which they are entitled under this Agreement,
(ii) the provisions set forth in _Section 9.3_: (x) are not intended to and
do not adequately compensate for the harm that would result from a breach of
this Agreement and (y) shall not be construed to diminish or otherwise impair
in any respect any Partys right to specific enforcement and (iii) the right
of specific performance is an integral part of the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement and without that right, neither the Company nor Parent nor
Purchaser would have entered into this Agreement. Each of the Parties hereto
agrees that it will not oppose the granting of an injunction, specific
performance and other equitable relief on the basis that the other Parties
hereto have an adequate remedy at law or an award of specific performance is
not an appropriate remedy for any reason at law or equity. The Parties hereto
acknowledge and agree that any Party seeking an injunction or injunctions to
prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and
provisions of this Agreement in accordance with this _Section 10.5(b)_ shall
not be required to provide any bond or other security in connection with any
such order or injunction. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in no event shall the
Company be entitled to seek the remedy of specific performance of this
Agreement directly against the Financing Sources, solely in their respective
capacities as lenders or arrangers in connection with the Financing.

 



 

 **(c)** EACH OF THE PARTIES HERETO IRREVOCABLY WAIVES ANY AND ALL RIGHT TO
TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY LEGAL PROCEEDING BETWEEN THE PARTIES HERETO ARISING OUT
OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY.

 



 

 **10.6** **Assignability**. This Agreement shall be binding upon, and shall
be enforceable by and inure solely to the benefit of, the Parties hereto and
their respective successors and permitted assigns; _provided, however,_ that
neither this Agreement nor any of the rights hereunder may be assigned without
the prior written consent of the other Parties hereto, and any attempted
assignment of this Agreement or any of such rights without such consent shall
be void and of no

 



     

 

 



 

effect; _provided, further,_ _however,_ that Parent or Purchaser may (a)
assign its rights under this Agreement to any direct or indirect wholly owned
Subsidiary so long as Parent provides the Company with prior written notice of
such assignment and such assignment does not impede or delay the consummation
of the Transactions or otherwise impede the rights of the stockholders of the
Company under this Agreement) and (b) pledge, transfer or assign its
respective rights hereunder to its Financing Sources as collateral security,
without the prior written consent of the Company; _provided_ that no such
assignment, transfer or pledge permitted pursuant to this _Section 10.6_
shall relieve Parent or Purchaser of its obligations hereunder.

 



 

 **10.7** **No Third Party Beneficiaries**. Nothing in this Agreement, express
or implied, is intended to or shall confer upon any Person (other than the
Parties hereto) any right, benefit or remedy of any nature whatsoever under or
by reason of this Agreement; except for: (i) if the Offer Acceptance Time
occurs (A) the right of the Companys stockholders to receive the Offer Price
or Merger Consideration, as applicable and (B) the right of the holders of
Company Stock Awards to receive the Merger Consideration pursuant to _Section
3.8_; (ii) each Indemnified Person set forth in _Section 7.4_; (iii) the
limitations on liability of the Company Related Parties set forth in _Section
9.3(b)_; and (iv) the provisions of _Section 10.12_ with respect to Financing
Sources. The representations and warranties in this Agreement are the product
of negotiations among the Parties and are for the sole benefit of the Parties
and, in some instances, the representations and warranties in this Agreement
may represent an allocation among the Parties of risks associated with
particular matters regardless of the knowledge of any of the Parties.
Consequently, Persons other than the Parties may not rely on the
representations and warranties in this Agreement as characterizations of
actual facts or circumstances as of the date of this Agreement or as of any
other date.

 **10.9** **Severability**. Any term or provision of this Agreement that is
invalid or unenforceable in any situation in any jurisdiction shall not affect
the validity or enforceability of the remaining terms and provisions of this
Agreement or the validity or enforceability of the offending term or provision
in any other situation or in any other jurisdiction. If a final judgment of a
court of competent jurisdiction declares that any term or provision of this
Agreement is invalid or unenforceable, the Parties hereto agree that the court
making such determination shall have the power to limit such term or
provision, to delete specific words or phrases or to replace such term or
provision with a term or provision that is valid and enforceable and that
comes closest to expressing the intention of the invalid or unenforceable term
or provision, and this Agreement shall be valid and enforceable as so
modified. In the event such court does not exercise the power granted to it in
the prior sentence, the Parties hereto agree to replace such invalid or
unenforceable term or provision with a valid and enforceable term or provision
that will achieve, to the extent possible, the economic, business and other
purposes of such invalid or unenforceable term or provision.

include the plural, and vice versa; (b) the masculine gender shall include the
feminine and neuter genders; the feminine gender shall include the masculine
and neuter genders; and the neuter gender shall include masculine and feminine
genders; (c) the word "extent" in the phrase "to the extent" means the degree
to which a subject or other thing extends, and does not simply mean "if"; (d)
the words "include" and "including," and variations thereof, shall not be
deemed to be terms of limitation, but rather shall be deemed to be followed by
the words "without limitation;" (e) the meaning assigned to each capitalized
term defined and used in this Agreement is equally applicable to both the
singular and the plural forms of such term, and words denoting any gender
include all genders; (f) where a word or phrase is defined in this Agreement,

material or that such information is required to be referred to or disclosed
under this Agreement or such information constitutes a representation or
warranty of the Company; (k) the word "or" shall not be exclusive (i.e., "or"
shall be deemed to mean "and/or") and (l) "made available" and words of
similar import refer to documents which were (i) delivered in person or
electronically to the other Party or its Representatives or posted to the
electronic data room maintained by the disclosing party or its Representatives
in connection with the Transactions prior to the execution of this Agreement (
_provided_ that, in the case of delivery electronically or via such data room,
the other Party had access to such documents on or prior to the execution of
this Agreement (it being agreed that a Party shall be deemed to have had

Commitment Letter, each of the Parties, on behalf of themselves and their
respective controlled Affiliates, hereby: (a) agrees that any Legal Proceeding
involving the Financing Sources, whether in law or in equity, whether in
contract or in tort or otherwise, in any way arising out of or relating to
this Agreement, the Financing Agreements or any of the transactions

heard and determined exclusively in, any federal court of the United States
sitting in the Borough of Manhattan or, if that court does not have subject

thereunder, whether in law or in equity, whether in contract or in tort or
otherwise, and waives any and all claims and causes of action against the

as it now exists and as it may hereafter be amended, no director or officer of

shall so require, the election of directors of the Corporation need not be by

ARTICLE I

 



 

 _Meetings of Stockholders; Stockholders  
Consent in Lieu of Meeting_

 



 

SECTION 1.01. _Annual Meeting._ The annual meeting of the stockholders for the
election of directors, and for the transaction of such other business as may
properly come before the meeting, shall be held at such place, date and hour
as shall be fixed by the Board of Directors and designated in the notice or
waiver of notice thereof; except that no annual meeting need be held if all
actions, including the election of directors, required by the General
Corporation Law of the State of Delaware to be taken at a stockholders annual
meeting are taken by written consent in lieu of a meeting pursuant to Section
1.03 of these By-laws.

 



 

SECTION 1.02. _Special Meetings._ A special meeting of the stockholders for
any purpose or purposes may be called by the Board of Directors, the Chairman
of the Board of Directors, the President or the Secretary of the Corporation
or a stockholder or stockholders holding of record at least a majority of the
shares of common stock, par value $0.001 per share, of the Corporation ("
_Common Stock_ ") issued and outstanding, such meeting to be held at such
place, date and hour as shall be designated in the notice or waiver of notice
thereof.

 



 

SECTION 1.03. _Stockholders  Consent in Lieu of Meeting._ Any action required
by the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware to be taken at any

     

 

 



 

annual or special meeting of the stockholders of the Corporation, or any
action which may be taken at any annual or special meeting of such
stockholders, may be taken without a meeting, without prior notice and without
a vote, if a consent in writing, setting forth the action so taken, shall be
signed by all the stockholders.

 



 

SECTION 1.04. _Quorum and Adjournment._ Except as otherwise provided by law,
by the Certificate of Incorporation of the Corporation or by these By-laws,
the presence, in person or by proxy, of the holders of a majority of the
aggregate voting power of the stock issued and outstanding, entitled to vote
thereat, shall be requisite and shall constitute a quorum for the transaction
of business at all meetings of stockholders. If, however, such a quorum shall
not be present in person or represented by proxy at any meeting of
stockholders, the stockholders present, although less than a quorum, shall
have the power to adjourn the meeting.

 



 

SECTION 1.05. _Majority Vote Required._ When a quorum is present at any
meeting of stockholders, the affirmative vote of the majority of the aggregate
voting power of the shares present in person or represented by proxy at the
meeting and entitled to vote on the subject matter shall constitute the act of
the stockholders, unless by express provision of law, the Certificate of
Incorporation of the Corporation or these By-laws a different vote is
required, in which case such express provision shall govern and control.

 



 

SECTION 1.06. _Manner of Voting._ At each meeting of stockholders, each
stockholder having the right to vote shall be entitled to vote in person or by
proxy. Proxies need not be filed with the Secretary of the Corporation until
the meeting is called to order, but shall be filed before being voted. Each
stockholder shall be entitled to vote each share of stock having voting power
registered in his or her name on the books of the

     

 

 



 

Corporation on the record date fixed, as provided in Section 6.07 of these By-
laws, for the determination of stockholders entitled to vote at such meeting.

ARTICLE II

SECTION 2.01. _General Powers._ The management of the affairs of the
Corporation shall be vested in the Board of Directors, which may exercise all
such powers of the Corporation and do all such lawful acts and things as are
not by law or by the Certificate of Incorporation of the Corporation directed
or required to be exercised or done by the stockholders.

 



 

SECTION 2.02. _Number and Term of Office._ The number of directors which shall
constitute the whole Board of Directors shall be fixed from time to time by a
vote of a majority of the whole Board of Directors. The term "whole Board of
Directors" is used herein to refer to the total number of directors which the
Corporation would have if there were no vacancies. Directors need not be
stockholders. Each director shall hold office until his or her successor is
elected and qualified, or until his or her earlier death or resignation or
removal in the manner hereinafter provided.

2. **CONTINGENT VALUE RIGHTS**

 



 

2.1. _CVRs_. The CVRs represent the rights of Holders to receive a contingent
cash payment pursuant to the Merger Agreement and this Agreement. The initial
Holders shall be determined pursuant to the terms of the Merger Agreement and
this Agreement, and a list of the initial Holders shall be furnished to the
Rights Agent by or on behalf of Parent in accordance with _Section 4.1_
hereof.

 



 

2.2. _Non-transferable_. The CVRs may not be sold, assigned, transferred,
pledged, encumbered or in any other manner transferred or disposed of, in
whole or in part, other than through a Permitted Transfer. Any such sale,
assignment, transfer, pledge, encumbrance or disposal that is not a Permitted
Transfer shall be null and void.

 



     

 

 



 

2.3. _No Certificate; Registration; Registration of Transfer; Change of
Address_.

 



 

(a) The CVRs shall not be evidenced by a certificate or other instrument.

 



 

(b) The Rights Agent shall keep a register (the " ** _CVR Register_** ") for
the purpose of registering CVRs and transfers of CVRs as herein provided. The
CVR Register will initially show one position for Cede and Co. representing all
of the CVRs that are issued to the holders of Shares held by DTC on behalf of
the street holders of the Shares. The Rights Agent will have no responsibility
whatsoever directly to the street name holders or DTC participants with
respect to transfers of CVRs. With respect to any payments to be made under
_Section 2.4_ below, the Rights Agent will accomplish the payment to any
former street name holders of the Shares by sending a lump payment to DTC. The
Rights Agent will have no responsibilities whatsoever with regard to the
distribution of payments by DTC to such street name holders. In the case of
CVRs to be received by the holders of Covered Equity Awards pursuant to the
Merger Agreement, such CVRs shall initially be registered in the name and
address of the holder of such Covered Equity Awards as set forth in the
records of the Company at the Effective Time and in a denomination equal to
the number of shares of Company Common Stock subject to such Covered Equity
Awards cancelled in connection with the Merger.

 



 

(c) Subject to the restrictions on transferability set forth in _Section
2.2_, every request made to transfer a CVR must be in writing and accompanied
by a written instrument of transfer and other documentation reasonably
requested by the Rights Agent in form reasonably satisfactory to the Rights
Agent pursuant to its guidelines, duly executed by the Holder thereof, the
Holders attorney duly authorized in writing, the Holders personal
representative or the Holders survivor, as applicable, and setting forth in
reasonable detail the circumstances relating to the transfer. Upon receipt of
such written notice, the Rights Agent shall, subject to its reasonable
determination that the transfer instrument is in proper form and the transfer
otherwise complies with the other terms and conditions of this Agreement
(including the provisions of _Section 2.2_), register the transfer of the
CVRs in the CVR Register and notify the Parent of the same. No service charge
shall be made for any registration of transfer of a CVR, but Parent and the
Rights Agent may require payment of a sum sufficient to cover any stamp or
other Tax or charge that is imposed in connection with any such registration
of transfer. The Rights Agent shall have no duty or obligation to take any
action under any section of this Agreement that requires the payment of
applicable Taxes or charges unless and until the Rights Agent is satisfied
that all such Taxes or charges have been paid. All duly transferred CVRs
registered in the CVR Register shall be the valid obligations of Parent and
shall entitle the transferee to the same benefits and rights under this
Agreement as those held immediately prior to the transfer by the transferor.
No transfer of a CVR shall be valid unless and until registered in the CVR
Register.

 



 

(d) A Holder may make a written request to the Rights Agent to change such
Holders address of record in the CVR Register. The written request must be
duly executed by the Holder. Upon receipt of such written request, the Rights
Agent is hereby authorized to, and shall promptly, record the change of
address in the CVR Register.

 



 

2.4. _Payment Procedures_.

 



 

(a) In the event that the Milestone is first achieved on or prior to December
31, 2022, then on or prior to the date that is twenty (20) Business Days
following such achievement of the Milestone, Parent shall deliver to the
Rights Agent (i) a notice (the " ** _Milestone Notice_** ") indicating that
the Milestone was achieved and (ii) cash, by wire transfer of immediately
available funds to an account specified by the Rights Agent, equal to the
aggregate amount necessary to pay the Milestone Payment to all Holders
pursuant to _Section 4.2_, along with any letter of instruction reasonably
required by the Rights Agent.

 



     

 

 



 

(b) The Rights Agent shall promptly, and in any event within ten (10) Business
Days of receipt of a Milestone Notice and cash, by wire transfer of
immediately available funds, equal to the aggregate amount necessary to pay
the Milestone Payment to all Holders pursuant to _Section 4.2_ as well as any
letter of instruction reasonably required by the Rights Agent, send each
Holder at its registered address a copy of such Milestone Notice. If a
Milestone Payment is payable to the Holders, then at the time the Rights Agent
sends a copy of the Milestone Notice to the Holders, the Rights Agent shall
also pay the Milestone Payment to each of the Holders in accordance with the
corresponding letter of instruction (i) by check mailed to the address of such
Holder reflected in the CVR Register as of 5:00 p.m. New York City time on the
date of the Milestone Notice or (ii) with respect to any such Holder that is
due an amount in excess of $100,000 in the aggregate who has provided the
Rights Agent wiring instructions in writing as of the close of business on the
date of the Milestone Notice, by wire transfer of immediately available funds
to the account specified on such instructions.

 



 

(c) Parent shall be entitled to deduct or withhold, or cause the Rights Agent
to deduct or withhold, from any payments made pursuant to this Agreement such
amounts as are required to be deducted or withheld therefrom under the Code,
the U.S. Treasury Regulations thereunder, or any other applicable Tax Law, as
may be reasonably determined by Parent and communicated to the Rights Agent in
writing. Prior to making any such Tax withholdings or causing any such Tax
withholdings to be made with respect to any Holder (other than payroll
withholding and reporting on the Covered Milestone Payments), Parent shall
instruct the Rights Agent to use commercially reasonable efforts to solicit
from such Holder an IRS Form W-9 or other applicable Tax form within a
reasonable amount of time in order to provide the opportunity for the Holder
to provide such Tax forms to avoid or reduce such withholding amounts. To the
extent any such amounts are so deducted or withheld, such amounts shall be
treated for all purposes under this Agreement and the Merger Agreement as
having been paid to the Holder to whom such amounts would otherwise have been
paid, and, to the extent required by applicable Law, Parent shall deliver (or
shall cause the Rights Agent to deliver) to the Holder to whom such amounts
would otherwise have been paid an Internal Revenue Service Form 1099, an
Internal Revenue Service Form W-2 or other reasonably acceptable evidence of
such withholding. To the extent such amounts are so deducted or withheld from
the Covered Milestone Payments (as defined below), the Rights Agent shall, as
soon as reasonably practicable, deliver such amounts to Parent for the
purposes of remitting such amounts to the IRS. In no event shall the Rights
Agent have any duty, obligation or responsibility for wage or W-2 reporting
with respect to Milestone Payments (including Covered Milestone Payments) made
to the Holders.

 



 

(d) If any funds delivered to the Rights Agent for payment to Holders as
Milestone Payments remain undistributed to the Holders on the date that is six
(6) months after the date of the applicable Milestone Notice, Parent shall be
entitled to require the Rights Agent to deliver to Parent or its designee any
funds which had been made available to the Rights Agent in connection with
such Milestone Payment and not disbursed to the Holders (including, all
interest and other income received by the Rights Agent in respect of all funds
made available to it), and, thereafter, such Holders shall be entitled to look
to Parent (subject to abandoned property, escheat and other similar Laws) only
as general creditors thereof with respect to the Milestone Payments that may
be payable.

 



 

(e) Neither Parent, the Rights Agent nor any of their Affiliates shall be
liable to any Holder for any Milestone Payments delivered to a public official
pursuant to any abandoned property, escheat or other similar Laws. Any amounts
remaining unclaimed by such Holders at such time at which such amounts would
otherwise escheat to or become property of any Governmental Body shall become,
to the extent permitted by applicable Laws, the property of Parent or its
designee, free and clear of all claims or interest of any Person previously
entitled thereto. In addition to and not in limitation of any other indemnity
obligation herein, Parent agrees to indemnify and hold harmless the Rights
Agent with respect

 



     

 

 



 

to any liability, penalty, cost or expense the Rights Agent may incur or be
subject to in connection with transferring such property to Parent.

 



 

(f) Except to the extent any portion of any Milestone Payment is required to
be treated as imputed interest pursuant to applicable Law, the parties hereto
intend to treat (i) the CVRs received with respect to the Shares pursuant to
the Merger Agreement for all U.S. federal and applicable state and local
income Tax purposes as additional consideration paid at the Effective Time for
the Shares pursuant to the Merger Agreement, (ii) any Milestone Payments
received in respect of such CVRs as amounts realized on the disposition of the
applicable CVRs and (iii) Milestone Payments paid in respect of each CVR that
was received with respect to Covered Equity Awards pursuant to the Merger
Agreement (the " ** _Covered Milestone Payments_** "), and not the receipt of
such CVR, for all U.S. federal and applicable state and local income Tax
purposes, as wages in the year in which the Milestone Payment is made.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, Parent shall, and shall cause the Surviving
Corporation to, report imputed interest on the CVRs and Milestone Payments
pursuant to Section 483 of the Code.

 



 

2.5. _No Voting, Dividends or Interest; No Equity or Ownership Interest_.

 



 

(a) The CVRs shall not have any voting or dividend rights, and interest shall
not accrue on any amounts payable on the CVRs to any Holder.

 



 

(b) The CVRs shall not represent any equity or ownership interest in Parent or
in any constituent company to the Merger or any of their respective
Subsidiaries or Affiliates.

 



 

2.6. _Ability to Abandon CVR_. A Holder may at any time, at such Holders
option, abandon all of such Holders remaining rights in a CVR by transferring
such CVR to Parent or any of its Affiliates without consideration therefor.
Nothing in this Agreement shall prohibit Parent or any of its Affiliates from
offering to acquire or acquiring any CVRs for consideration from the Holders,
in private transactions or otherwise, in its sole discretion. Any CVRs
acquired by Parent or any of its Affiliates shall be automatically deemed
extinguished and no longer outstanding for purposes of the definition of
Acting Holders and Article 5 and Article 6

3.1. _Certain Duties and Responsibilities_. Prior to the occurrence of an
Event of Default, and after the curing or waiving of all such Events of
Default which may have occurred, the Rights Agent shall not have any liability

Agreement, except to the extent of its gross negligence, bad faith or willful

been cured or waived), the Rights Agent shall exercise such of the rights and

Agent shall, in the absence of gross negligence, bad faith or willful or
intentional misconduct on its part, incur no liability and be held harmless by
Parent for or in respect of any action taken, suffered or omitted to be taken

certificate;

 



 

(c) the Rights Agent may engage and consult with counsel of its selection and

Parent only;

 



 

(h) the Rights Agent shall have no liability and shall be held harmless by
Parent in respect of the validity of this Agreement or the execution and
delivery hereof (except the due execution and delivery hereof by the Rights
Agent and the enforceability of this Agreement against the Rights Agent
assuming the due execution and delivery hereof by Parent); nor shall it be
responsible for any breach by Parent of any covenant or condition contained in
this Agreement;

 



 

(i) Parent agrees to indemnify the Rights Agent for, and hold the Rights Agent
harmless against, any loss, liability, claim, demands, suits or expense
arising out of or in connection with Rights Agents duties under this
Agreement, including the reasonable out-of-pocket costs and expenses of
defending Rights Agent against any claims, charges, demands, suits or loss,
unless such loss has been determined by a court of competent jurisdiction to
be a result of Rights Agents gross negligence, bad faith or willful or
intentional misconduct;

provision of this Agreement or for any consequential damages arising out of
any act or failure to act hereunder in the absence of gross negligence, bad

reasonable and necessary out-of-

risk its own funds or otherwise incur any financial liability in the

or adequate indemnification against such risk or liability is not reasonably
assured to it.

removal shall become effective until a successor Rights Agent has been
appointed and accepted such appointment in accordance with _Section 3.4_.
Notice of such removal shall be given by Parent to the Rights Agent, which
notice shall be sent at least sixty (60) days prior to the date so specified.

commercial bank. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if Parent shall fail to make

such removal or after it has been notified in writing of such resignation or
incapacity by the resigning or incapacitated Rights Agent, then the incumbent
Rights Agent may apply to any court of competent jurisdiction for the
appointment of a new Rights Agent. The successor Rights Agent so appointed
shall, forthwith upon its acceptance of such appointment in accordance with
_Section 3.4_, become the successor Rights Agent.

 



 

(c) Parent shall give notice of each resignation and each removal of a Rights
Agent and each appointment of a successor Rights Agent by mailing written
notice of such event by first-class mail to the Holders as their names and
addresses appear in the CVR Register. Each notice shall include the name and
address of the successor Rights Agent. If Parent fails to send such notice
within ten (10) Business Days after acceptance of appointment by a successor
Rights Agent, the successor Rights Agent shall cause the notice to be mailed
at the expense of Parent. Failure to give any notice provided for in this
_Section 3.3_, however, shall not affect the legality or validity of the
resignation or removal of the Rights Agent or the appointment of the successor
Rights Agent, as the case may be.

 



 

3.4. _Acceptance of Appointment by Successor_. Every successor Rights Agent
appointed hereunder shall execute, acknowledge and deliver to Parent and to
the retiring Rights Agent an instrument accepting such appointment and a
counterpart of this Agreement, and thereupon such successor Rights Agent,
without any further act, deed or conveyance, shall become vested with all the
rights, powers, trusts and duties of the retiring Rights Agent. On request of
Parent or the successor Rights Agent, the retiring Rights Agent shall execute
and deliver an instrument transferring to the successor Rights Agent all the
rights, powers, trusts and duties of the retiring Rights Agent.

 



 

4. **COVENANTS**

 



 

4.1. _List of Holders_. Parent shall furnish or cause to be furnished to the
Rights Agent, in a form reasonably satisfactory to the Rights Agent, and
received from Parents Depository Agent in the

 



     

 

 



 

Offer, Parents Paying Agent in the Merger, and in the case of Holders who
held Covered Equity Awards, the Company, the names and addresses of the
Holders promptly upon the Offer Acceptance Time or the Effective Time, as
applicable.

 



 

4.2. _Payment of Milestone Payments_. If the Milestone has been achieved in
accordance with this Agreement, Parent shall, promptly (but in any event no
later than five (5) Business Days) following the delivery of the Milestone
Notice, deposit with the Rights Agent, for payment to the Holders in
accordance with _Section 2.4_, the aggregate amount necessary to pay the
Milestone Payment to all Holders.

 



 

4.3. _Books and Records_. Parent shall, and shall cause its subsidiaries to,
keep true, complete and accurate records in sufficient detail to enable the
Holders and their consultants or professional advisors to determine the
amounts payable hereunder.

 



 

4.4. _Further Assurances._ Parent agrees that it will perform, execute,
acknowledge and deliver or cause to be performed, executed, acknowledged and
delivered, all such further and other acts, instruments and assurances as may
reasonably be required by the Rights Agent for the carrying out or performing
by the Rights Agent of the provisions of this Agreement.

 



 

4.5. _Diligent Efforts_. Commencing upon the Closing, Parent shall, and shall
cause its Affiliates and direct any Sublicensees to, use Diligent Efforts to
achieve the Milestone. Without limiting the foregoing, neither Parent nor any
of its Affiliates shall act in bad faith for the purpose of avoiding
achievement of the Milestone or the payment of the Milestone Payment.

 



 

5. **AMENDMENTS**

 



 

5.1. _Amendments without Consent of Holders_.

 



 

(a) Without the consent of any Holders or the Rights Agent, Parent at any time
and from time to time, may enter into one or more amendments hereto, for any
of the following purposes:

 



 

(i) to evidence the succession of another Person as a successor Rights Agent
and the assumption by any such successor of the covenants and obligations of
the Rights Agent herein;

 



 

(ii) to add to the covenants of Parent such further covenants, restrictions,
conditions or provisions as Parent shall consider to be for the protection of
the Holders; _provided_ that, in each case, such provisions do not adversely
affect the interests of the Holders;

 



 

(iii) to cure any ambiguity, to correct or supplement any provision herein
that may be defective or inconsistent with any other provision herein or in
the Merger Agreement, or to make any other provisions with respect to matters
or questions arising under this Agreement; _provided_ that, in each case, such
provisions do not adversely affect the interests of the Holders;

 



 

(iv) as may be necessary or appropriate to ensure that the CVRs are not
subject to registration under the Securities Act, the Exchange Act or any
applicable state securities or "blue sky" laws;

 



 

(v) to evidence the assignment of this Agreement by Parent as provided in
_Section 7.3_; or

 



   

    

 

 



 

(vi) any other amendments hereto for the purpose of adding, eliminating or
changing any provisions of this Agreement, unless such addition, elimination
or change is adverse to the interests of the Holders.

 



 

(b) Without the consent of any Holders, Parent and the Rights Agent, at any
time and from time to time, may enter into one or more amendments thereto to
reduce the number of CVRs, in the event any Holder agrees to renounce such
Holders rights under this Agreement in accordance with _Section 7.4_ or to
transfer CVRs to Parent pursuant to _Section 2.6._

 



 

(c) Promptly after the execution by Parent and/or the Rights Agent of any
amendment pursuant to the provisions of this _Section 5.1_, Parent shall mail
(or cause the Rights Agent to mail) a notice thereof by first class mail to
the Holders at their addresses as they appear on the CVR Register, setting
forth such amendment.

 



 

5.2. _Amendments with Consent of Holders_.

 



 

(a) Subject to _Section 5.1_ (which amendments pursuant to _Section 5.1_ may
be made without the consent of any Holder or the Rights Agent), with the
consent of the Holders of not less than a majority of the outstanding CVRs as
set forth in the CVR Register, whether evidenced in writing or taken at a
meeting of the Holders, Parent and the Rights Agent may enter into one or more
amendments hereto for the purpose of adding, eliminating or changing any
provisions of this Agreement, even if such addition, elimination or change is
materially adverse to the interest of the Holders.

 



 

(b) Promptly after the execution by Parent and the Rights Agent of any
amendment pursuant to the provisions of this _Section 5.2_, Parent shall mail
(or cause the Rights Agent to mail) a notice thereof by first class mail to
the Holders at their addresses as they appear on the CVR Register, setting
forth such amendment.

 



 

5.3. _Execution of Amendments_. Prior to executing any amendment permitted by
this _Section _5, the Rights Agent shall be entitled to receive, and shall be
fully protected in relying upon, an opinion of counsel selected by Parent
stating that the execution of such amendment is authorized or permitted by
this Agreement. The Rights Agent may, but is not obligated to, enter into any
such amendment that affects the Rights Agents own rights, powers, trusts or
duties under this Agreement or otherwise.

 



 

5.4. _Effect of Amendments_. Upon the execution of any amendment under this
_Section _5, this Agreement shall be modified in accordance therewith, such
amendment shall form a part of this Agreement for all purposes and every
Holder shall be bound thereby.

 



 

6. **REMEDIES OF THE HOLDERS**

 



 

6.1. _Event of Default_. " ** _Event of Default_** " with respect to the CVRs,
means each one of the following events which shall have occurred and be
continuing (whatever the reason for such Event of Default and whether it shall
be voluntary or involuntary or be effected by operation of Law or pursuant to
any judgment, decree or order of any court or any order, rule or regulation of
any Governmental Body):

 



 

(a) default in the payment by Parent pursuant to the terms of this Agreement
of all or any part of the Milestone Payment after a period of ten (10)
Business Days after the Milestone Payment shall become due and payable; or

 



 

(b) material default in the performance, or breach in any material respect, of
any covenant or warranty of Parent hereunder (other than a default in whose
performance or whose breach is

 



     

 

 



 

elsewhere in this _Section 6.1_ specifically dealt with), and continuance of
such default or breach for a period of ninety (90) days after a written notice
specifying such default or breach and requiring it to be remedied is given,
which written notice states that it is a "Notice of Default" hereunder and is
sent by registered or certified mail to Parent by the Rights Agent or to
Parent and the Rights Agent by the Acting Holders.

 



 

If an Event of Default described above occurs and is continuing (and has not
been cured or waived), then, and in each and every such case, (i) the Rights
Agent by notice in writing to Parent or (ii) the Rights Agent upon the written
request of the Acting Holders by notice in writing to Parent (and to the
Rights Agent if given by the Acting Holders), shall commence an arbitration
proceeding to protect the rights of the Holders, including to obtain payment
for any amounts then due and payable.

 



 

The foregoing provisions of this _Section 6.1_, however, are subject to the
condition that if, at any time after the Rights Agent shall have commenced
such arbitration proceeding, and before any award shall have been obtained,
Parent shall pay or shall deposit with the Rights Agent a sum sufficient to
pay all amounts which shall have become due and such amount as shall be
sufficient to cover reasonable compensation to the Rights Agent, its agents,
attorneys and counsel, and all Events of Default under this Agreement shall
have been cured, waived or otherwise remedied as provided herein, then and in
every such case the Acting Holders, by written notice to Parent and to the
Rights Agent, may waive all defaults that are the subject of such arbitration
proceeding, but no such waiver or rescission and annulment shall extend to or
shall affect any subsequent default.

 



 

6.2. _Arbitration Proceedings for Enforcement_. If an Event of Default has
occurred, has not been waived and is continuing, the Rights Agent may in its
discretion proceed to protect and enforce the rights vested in it by this
Agreement by commencing arbitration proceedings pursuant to _Section 7.6_.

 



 

6.3. _Limitations on Suits by Holders_. Subject to the last sentence of this
_Section 6.3_, no Holder of any CVR shall have any right under this Agreement
to commence arbitration proceedings under or with respect to this Agreement,
or for the appointment of a Rights Agent, receiver, liquidator, custodian or
other similar official, for any other remedy hereunder, unless (i) such Holder
previously shall have given to the Rights Agent written notice of default,
(ii) the Acting Holders shall have made written request upon the Rights Agent
to commence such arbitration proceeding in its own name as Rights Agent
hereunder and shall have offered to the Rights Agent such reasonable indemnity
as it may require against the costs, expenses and liabilities to be incurred
therein or thereby and (iii) the Rights Agent for fifteen (15) days after its
receipt of such notice, request and offer of indemnity shall have failed to
commence any such arbitration proceeding and no direction inconsistent with
such written request shall have been given to the Rights Agent pursuant to
_Section 6.4_. Notwithstanding any other provision in this Agreement, the
right of any Holder of any CVR to receive payment of the amounts that a
Milestone Notice indicates are payable in respect of such CVR on or after the
applicable due date, or to commence arbitration proceedings for the
enforcement of any such payment on or after such due date, shall not be
impaired or affected without the consent of such Holder.

 



 

6.4. _Control by Acting Holders._ Subject to the last sentence of this
_Section 6.4_, the Acting Holders shall have the right to direct the time,
method and place of conducting any proceeding for any remedy available to the
Rights Agent, or exercising any power conferred on the Rights Agent by this
Agreement; _provided_ that such direction shall not be otherwise than in
accordance with Law and the provisions of this Agreement; _provided_ ,
_further_ that (subject to the provisions of _Section 3.1_) the Rights Agent
shall have the right to decline to follow any such direction if the Rights
Agent, being advised by counsel, shall determine that the action or proceeding
so directed may not lawfully be taken or if the Rights Agent (acting in good
faith through its board of directors, the executive committee, or a committee
of directors of the Rights Agent) shall determine that the action or
proceedings so directed would involve the

 



     

 

 



 

Rights Agent in personal liability or if the Rights Agent in good faith shall
so determine that the actions or forbearances specified in or pursuant to such
direction would be unduly prejudicial to the interests of Holders not joining
in the giving of said direction. Nothing in this Agreement shall impair the
right of the Rights Agent in its discretion to take any action deemed proper
by the Rights Agent and which is not inconsistent with such direction or
directions by the Acting Holders.

 



 

7. **OTHER PROVISIONS OF GENERAL APPLICATION**

 



 

7.1. _Notices to the Rights Agent and Parent_. Any notice or other

7.2. _Notice to Holders_. Where this Agreement provides for notice to Holders,
such notice shall be sufficiently given (unless otherwise herein expressly
provided) if in writing and mailed, first-class postage prepaid, to each
Holder affected by such event, at the Holders address as it appears in the
CVR Register, not later than the latest date, and not earlier than the
earliest date, if any, prescribed for the giving of such notice. In any case
where notice to Holders is given by mail, neither the failure to mail such
notice, nor any defect in any notice so mailed, to any particular Holder shall
affect the sufficiency of such notice with respect to other Holders.

 



 

7.3. _Parent Successors and Assigns_. Parent may assign, in its sole
discretion and without the consent of any other Person, any or all of its
rights, interests and obligations hereunder (i) to one or more direct or
indirect wholly-owned subsidiaries of Parent or (ii) to any purchaser,
licensee or sublicensee of substantial rights to the Product that is a company
in the pharmaceutical industry (each, an " ** _Assignee_** "); _provided_ that
the Assignee agrees to assume and be bound by all of the terms and conditions
of this Agreement. Any such Assignee may thereafter assign, in its sole
discretion and without the consent of any other party, any or all of its
rights, interests and obligations hereunder to one or more additional
Assignees which agree to assume and be bound by all of the terms and
conditions of this Agreement; _provided_ , _however_ , that in connection with
any assignment to an Assignee pursuant to clause (i) of the first sentence of
this _Section 7.3_ and, only if the Assignee does not have net assets of at
least $500,000,000 as shown on its most recently prepared financial
statements, clause (ii) of the first sentence of this _Section 7.3_, Parent
(or the other assignor) shall agree to remain liable for the performance by
each Assignee (and such other assignor, if applicable) of all covenants,
agreements and obligations of Parent hereunder, with such Assignee substituted
for Parent under this Agreement. This Agreement will be binding upon, inure to
the benefit of and be enforceable by Parents successors and each Assignee.
Subject to compliance with the requirements set forth in this _Section 7.3_
relating to assignments, this Agreement shall not restrict Parents, any
Assignees or any of their respective successors ability to merge or
consolidate with, or sell, issue, license or dispose of its stock or other
equity interests or assets to, any other Person, or spin-off or split-off.
Each of Parents successors and each Assignee shall, by a supplemental
contingent consideration payment agreement or other acknowledgement executed
and delivered to the Rights Agent, expressly assume payment of amounts on all
of the CVRs and the performance of every obligation, agreement and covenant of
this Agreement on the part of Parent to be performed or observed. The Rights
Agent may not assign this Agreement without Parents written consent. Any
attempted assignment of this Agreement or any such rights in violation of this
Section 7.3 shall be void and of no effect.

 



 

7.4. _No Third Party Beneficiaries_. Nothing in this Agreement, express or
implied, shall give to any Person (other than the Rights Agent, Parent,
Parents successors and Assignees, each of whom is intended to be, and is, a
third party beneficiary hereunder; _provided_ that the Holders shall be
considered third party beneficiaries solely to the extent set forth in
_Section 6_) any benefit or any legal or equitable right, remedy or claim
under this Agreement or under any covenant or provision herein contained, all
such covenants and provisions being for the sole benefit of the Rights Agent,
Parent, Parents successors and Assignees, and the Holders (solely to the
extent set forth in _Section 6)_. The Holders of CVRs shall have no rights
except the contractual rights as are expressly set forth in this Agreement.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, any Holder may at
any time agree to renounce, in whole or in part, whether or not for
consideration, such Holders rights under this Agreement by written notice to
the Rights Agent and Parent, which notice, if given, shall be irrevocable, and
Parent may, in its sole discretion, at any time offer consideration to Holders
in exchange for their agreement to irrevocably renounce their rights, in whole
or in part, hereunder.

 



 

7.5. _Governing Law_. This Agreement, the CVRs and all actions arising under
or in connection herewith and therewith (whether sounding in contract, tort or
otherwise) shall be governed by and construed

 



     

 

 



 

in accordance with the laws of the State of Delaware, regardless of the laws
that might otherwise govern under applicable principles of conflicts of laws
thereof.

 



 

7.6. _Arbitration_. Any dispute, controversy or claim (including any claim for
breach hereof) based upon, relating to or arising out of this Agreement or any
transaction contemplated hereby (other than a dispute, controversy or claim
asserted against or by the Rights Agent to the extent pertaining to the Rights
Agents rights, immunities, liabilities, duties, responsibilities or
obligations hereunder) shall be resolved by binding arbitration conducted in
accordance with the Rules of Arbitration (" ** _Rules_** ") of the
International Chamber of Commerce (the " ** _ICC_** "). The arbitration shall
be conducted by a panel of three arbitrators, each of whom shall be
independent and a lawyer or retired judge with at least fifteen years
experience in the pharmaceutical industry and with mergers and acquisitions.
No later than fifteen days after an arbitration proceeding is commenced under
this _Section 7.6_, Parent shall nominate one arbitrator and the Holder (or,
if more than one Holder is a party to the arbitration proceeding, all such
Holders collectively) shall nominate one arbitrator, and the two so nominated
arbitrators shall select the third arbitrator. If the two arbitrators cannot
or fail to agree upon the third arbitrator within fifteen days of their
confirmation by the ICC, the third arbitrator shall be appointed by the ICC in
accordance with the Rules. The arbitration shall be administered by the ICC
acting through its International Court of Arbitration. The arbitration shall
be conducted in the English language and the seat, or place, of the
arbitration shall be the city of New York, New York. Hearings shall be
conducted in New York, New York, or at such other location as mutually agreed
by Parent and the Holder or Holders that are party to the arbitration
proceeding. The arbitration award shall be final, conclusive, binding and non-
appealable and shall not be subject to further review by any court. The
arbitrator shall have no power to amend or supplement the terms of this
Agreement or the Merger Agreement or act ex aequo et bono. Judgment upon the
award may be entered in any court having jurisdiction thereof. Each party
shall bear his, her or its own costs of any such arbitration or investigation
in respect of any dispute. Any award payable in favor of the Holders or the
Rights Agent as a result of arbitration shall be distributed to the Holders on
a pro rata basis, based on the number of CVRs held by each Holder.

 



 

7.7. _Severability_. In the event that any provision of this Agreement, or the
application thereof, becomes or is declared by a court of competent
jurisdiction to be illegal, void or unenforceable, the remainder of this
Agreement shall continue in full force and effect and the application of such
provision to other Persons or circumstances shall be interpreted so as
reasonably to effect the intent of the parties. The parties further agree to
replace such void or unenforceable provision of this Agreement with a valid
and enforceable provision that will achieve, to the extent possible, the
economic, business and other purposes of such void or unenforceable provision.

 



 

7.8. _Termination_. This Agreement shall be terminated and of no force or
effect, the parties hereto shall have no liability hereunder (other than with
respect to monies due and owing by Parent to Rights Agent), and no payments
shall be required to be made, upon the earlier to occur of (a) the mailing by
the Rights Agent to the address of each Holder as reflected in the CVR
Register (or payment by wire transfer, as applicable) the full amount of the
potential Milestone Payment required to be paid under the terms of this
Agreement, (b) December 31, 2022, if the Milestone has not been achieved on or
prior to such date, and (c) the termination of the Merger Agreement in
accordance with its terms. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no such termination
shall affect any rights or obligations accrued prior to the effective date of
such termination or _Sections 7.4_ , _7.5_ , _7.6_ , _7.7_ , _7.9_ or this
_Section 7.8_, which shall survive the termination of this Agreement, or the
resignation, replacement or removal of the Rights Agent.

 



 

7.9. _Entire Agreement; Counterparts_. This Agreement, the Merger Agreement
and the Support Agreement constitute the entire agreement and supersede all
contemporaneous and prior agreements and understandings, both written and
oral, among or between any of the Parties, with respect to the subject

 



     

 

 



 

matter hereof and thereof. If and to the extent that any provision of this
Agreement is inconsistent or conflicts with the Merger Agreement, this
Agreement shall govern and be controlling. This Agreement may be executed in
counterparts, each of which shall be deemed an original and all of which shall
constitute one and the same instrument. The exchange of a fully executed
Agreement (in counterparts or otherwise) by PDF shall be sufficient to bind
the Parties to the terms and conditions of this Agreement.

 



 

[ _REMAINDER OF PAGE INTENTIONALLY LEFT BLANK_ ]

 



     

 

 



 

IN WITNESS WHEREOF, each of the parties has caused this Agreement to be
executed on its behalf by its duly authorized officers as of the day and year
first above written.
