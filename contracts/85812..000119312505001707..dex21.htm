Capital as determined in accordance with this _Section 2.7(c)_ shall be deemed
to never exceed the Target Base Amount), and (y) the Proposed Closing Date
Cash and Cash Equivalents, is referred to in this Agreement as the "

to herein from time to time as the " _Proposed Closing Date Calculations_ ".
The proposed Closing Date Statement of Net Working Capital shall be prepared

Working Capital as set forth on _Exhibit A_.



(ii) If Shareholder Representative does not give written notice of dispute (a
" _Purchase Price Dispute Notice_ ") to Parent within 30 days of receiving

If Shareholder Representative gives a Purchase Price Dispute Notice to Parent
(which Purchase Price Dispute Notice must set forth, in reasonable detail, the
items and amounts in dispute) within such 30-day period, Parent and
Shareholder Representative will use reasonable efforts to resolve the
dispute during the 30-day period commencing on the date Parent receives the
applicable Purchase Price Dispute Notice from Shareholder Representative.

resolution within such 30-day period, then the items in dispute shall be
submitted immediately to the Seattle, Washington office of KPMG LLP (the "
_Accounting Firm_ ") which shall be independent and if not independent, Parent
and Shareholder Representative shall cooperate to designate another
independent accountant to serve as the Accounting Firm. Each party agrees to
execute, if required by the Accounting Firm, a reasonable engagement letter.
The Accounting Firm shall determine only those issues still in dispute at the
time of submission to the Accounting Firm, and the Accounting Firms
determination shall be based upon and consistent with the terms and conditions
of this Agreement. The determination by the Accounting Firm shall be based on
presentations  



 

15  with respect to such disputed items by the Parent and Shareholder
Representative to the Accounting Firm and, if determined necessary by the
Accounting Firm, on the Accounting Firms independent review. Each of the
Parent and Shareholder Representative shall use its reasonable best efforts to
make its presentation as promptly as practicable following submission to the
Accounting Firm of the disputed items, and each such party shall be entitled,
as part of its presentation, to respond to the presentation of the other party
and any questions and requests of the Accounting Firm. In deciding any matter,
the Accounting Firm (i) shall be bound by the provisions of this _Section
2.7(c)_ and (ii) may not assign a value to any item greater than the greatest
value for such item claimed by either the Parent or Shareholder Representative
or less than the smallest value for such item claimed by the Parent or
Shareholder Representative. The Accounting Firms determination shall be made
within 60 days after its engagement, shall be set forth in a written statement
delivered to the Parent and Shareholder Representative and shall be final,
conclusive, non-appealable and binding for all purposes hereunder; _provided_
that such determination may be reviewed, corrected or set aside by a court of
competent jurisdiction but only upon a finding that the Accounting Firm
committed manifest error with respect to its determination. The determination
of the Accounting Firm shall not be deemed an award subject to review under
the Federal Arbitration Act or any other statute. The Accounting Firm will
revise the Proposed Closing Date Calculations as appropriate to reflect the
resolution of any objections thereto pursuant to this _Section 2.7(c)_. The
Proposed Purchase Price together with any revisions thereto pursuant to this
_Section 2.7(c)_ shall be deemed the actual Purchase Price for purposes
hereof.



(iv) In the event Shareholder Representative and Parent submit any unresolved
objections to an Accounting Firm for resolution as provided in this _Section
2.7(c)_ , the responsibility for the fees and expenses of the Accounting
Firm shall be as follows:



(A) if such Accounting Firm resolves all of the remaining objections in favor
of Parents position (the Purchase Price so determined is referred to herein
as the " _Low Value_ "), then all of the fees and expenses of the Accounting
Firm shall be paid from the Escrow Funds;



(B) if the Accounting Firm resolves all of the remaining objections in favor
of Shareholder Representatives position (the Purchase Price so determined is
referred to herein as the " _High Value_ "), then Parent will be responsible
for all of the fees and expenses of the Accounting Firm; and



(C) if such Accounting Firm neither resolves all of the remaining objections
in favor of Parents position nor resolves all of the remaining objections in
favor of Shareholder Representatives position (the Purchase Price so
determined is referred to herein as the " _Actual Value_ "), then that
fraction of the fees and expenses of the Accounting Firm equal to (x) the
difference between the High Value and the Actual Value over (y) the difference
between the High Value and the Low Value shall be paid from the Escrow Funds,
and Parent will be responsible for the remainder of the fees and expenses of
the Accounting Firm.



 

16 (v) Parent will make the financial records of the Surviving Corporation and
its Subsidiaries, as well as consultation with James Weber and David Bohan,
available to Shareholder Representative, its accountants, the Accounting Firm
and other representatives of Shareholder Representative and the Accounting
Firm at reasonable times upon reasonable notice at any time before and after
the delivery of the Proposed Closing Date Calculations and continuing during
the resolution of any objections with respect to, the Proposed Closing Date
Calculations. The parties shall cooperate and assist in the preparation of
the Proposed Closing Date Calculations and the conduct of the review, audits
and negotiations referred to in this _Section 2.7(c)_ , including making
available to the extent necessary all books, records, work papers and
personnel.



(d) _Adjustment to Estimated Purchase Price_.



(i) If the Actual Adjustment is a positive amount, Surviving Corporation will

Equity Securities (as defined in _Section 9.1(a)_ ) as of immediately prior to
the Closing (excluding holders of Options), such positive amount, together
with interest on such amount at an annual rate equal to the LIBOR six-month
rate of interest calculated on a 365-day year (as quoted on the Business Day
prior to the payment date by the Wall Street Journal) (the " _Interest Rate_
") from the Closing Date to the date of the payment of such amount to
Shareholder Representative, on behalf of the holders of Company Equity
Securities as of immediately prior to the Closing (excluding holders
of Options), less the applicable Pro Rata Portion of such amount payable to
holders of Options, by wire transfer or delivery of other immediately
available funds, in each case, within three business days after the date on
which the Purchase Price is finally determined pursuant to _Section 2.7(c)_
above, and (B) will pay (less any required withholding Tax) to each holder of
Options such holders applicable Pro Rata Portion of the total amount due and
payable by the Surviving Corporation pursuant to this first sentence of
_Section 2.7(d)(i)_. In such event, the Shareholder Representative shall
disburse such proceeds to the holders of Company Equity Securities (excluding
holders of Options) within five Business Days of receipt of such proceeds in
accordance with the applicable Pro Rata Portion.



(ii) If the Actual Adjustment is a negative amount, then within three Business
Days after the date on which the Purchase Price is finally determined
pursuant to _Section 2.7(c)_ above, Parent and Shareholder Representative
shall deliver joint written instructions to the Escrow Agent instructing the
Escrow Agent to deliver to the Surviving Corporation from the Escrow Funds
an amount equal to the absolute value of such negative amount, together with
interest on such amount at the Interest Rate from the Closing Date to the date
of the payment of such amount to Parent; _provided_ , _however_ , that in no
event will such aggregate amount exceed the amount then in the Escrow
Account.



(e) _Replenishment of Escrow Account_. The Shareholder Representative, on
behalf of the Company Securityholders, shall promptly repay into the Escrow
Account, dollar-for-dollar, the amount, if any, which is paid from the Escrow

result of a final determination (pursuant to _Section 2.7(c)_ ) that Net
Working Capital as of immediately prior to the Closing was less than
$18,100,000; _provided_   



 

17  that in no event shall the aggregate repayment obligation set forth in this

Preferred Stock Consideration, the Estimated Series C Preferred Stock
Consideration, the Estimated Series D Preferred Stock Consideration,
the Estimated Series E Preferred Stock Consideration, or the Estimated Common

after the Effective Time, upon surrender to the Shareholder Representative of
any Certificates (other than Certificates surrendered pursuant to the first
sentence of this  _Section 2.9(a)_ ), together with such duly executed letter
of transmittal, the holder of each such Certificate shall receive from the

Preferred Stock Consideration, the Estimated Series B Preferred Stock
Consideration, the Estimated Series C Preferred Stock Consideration, the
Estimated Series D Preferred Stock Consideration, the Estimated Series E
Preferred Stock Consideration, or the Estimated Common Stock Consideration, as

Each Certificate surrendered to the Shareholder Representative pursuant to
this _Section 2.9(a)_ shall be promptly delivered by the Shareholder
Representative to the Surviving Corporation and shall thereafter be promptly
canceled by the Surviving Corporation. Holders of Certificates shall not be
entitled to receive payment hereunder until such holders applicable
Certificates have been surrendered pursuant to this  _Section 2.9_ (or,
alternatively, such holder has complied with the provisions of _Section
2.9(b)_ below) and after the Effective Time. If payment or delivery is to be
made to a Person other than the Person in whose name a Certificate
so surrendered is registered, it shall be a condition of payment that the
Certificate so surrendered shall be properly endorsed or otherwise in proper
form for transfer, that the signatures on the Certificate or any related stock
power shall be properly guaranteed and that the Person requesting such
payment either pay any transfer or other Taxes required by reason of the

or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the registered
holder of such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate in form and substance

accepted before the Effective Time) or the Surviving Corporation and
Shareholder Representative (if such affidavit is accepted after the Effective
Time), and upon the providing of a customary undertaking to indemnify
Shareholder Representative and the Surviving Corporation from losses relating
to such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate, the Shareholder Representative
will issue or cause to be issued in exchange for such lost, stolen or
destroyed Certificate the Preferred Stock Consideration or the Common Stock
Consideration, as applicable, in respect thereof in the manner set forth in
_Section 2.7_ and/or _Section 2.8_.



(c) If Certificates are not surrendered prior to the date that is three years
after the Effective Time (or such earlier date to the extent that any
cash payable to the holder of such Certificate would otherwise escheat to or
become the property of any Governmental Authority), unclaimed amounts
(including interest thereon) of Preferred Stock Consideration and Common Stock
Consideration shall, to the extent permitted by applicable law, become the
property of the Surviving Corporation and may be commingled with the general
funds of the Surviving Corporation, free and clear of all claims or interest,
and the Shareholder Representative shall promptly pay any such amounts to the
Surviving Corporation. Notwithstanding the foregoing, provided that any
shareholders of the Company who have not theretofore complied with the
provisions of this _Section 2.9_ shall thereafter look only to the Surviving
Corporation (or, until such time as any unclaimed amounts contemplated by the
previous sentence have been paid to the Surviving Corporation, to the
Shareholder Representative) and, in any event, only as general creditors
thereof for payment for their claims in the form and amounts to which such
shareholders are entitled; _provided_ that no party hereto or the Surviving
Corporation or the Shareholder Representative shall be liable to a holder of
any Certificate for cash delivered to a public official pursuant to
applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar laws upon the lapse of the
applicable time periods provided for therein.



(d) After the Effective Time, there shall be no transfers on the stock
transfer books of the Surviving Corporation of the shares of Preferred Stock

If, after the Effective Time, Certificates are presented to the Shareholder
Representative and then to the Surviving Corporation, they shall be canceled
and exchanged for the Preferred Stock Consideration or the Common Stock
Consideration, as applicable, as provided for, in accordance with, and subject
to the provisions of this _Section 2.9_.



Section 2.10 _Dissenting Shares_. __Each share of Common Stock or Preferred
Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time held by
shareholders who shall  



 

21  have properly exercised their dissenters rights with respect thereto under
Chapter 23B.13 of the WBCA (such shares of capital stock, collectively, the "
_Dissenting Shares_ ") shall be canceled as of the Effective Time.
Notwithstanding _Section 2.7_ , _Section 2.8_ and _Section 2.9_ hereof, each
Dissenting Share shall not be converted into the right to receive
the applicable Common Stock Consideration or Preferred Stock Consideration
pursuant to the Merger, but in lieu thereof, the holders of such Dissenting
Shares shall be entitled to receive payment of the fair value of such shares
in accordance with the provisions of Chapter 23B.13 of the WBCA; _provided_
that each Dissenting Share held by a shareholder who (a) shall thereafter
withdraw his or her demand for payment of fair value with the consent of the
Company or (b) shall fail to perfect his or her right to such payment as
provided in such Chapter 23B.13 shall be deemed to be converted as of the
Effective Time into the right to receive the applicable Common Stock
Consideration or Preferred Stock Consideration, as applicable, in the
form such holder otherwise would have been entitled to receive as a result of
the Merger. The Company shall give Parent and Shareholder Representative
prompt notice of any demands received by the Company under Chapter 23B.13 of
the WBCA, Shareholder Representative shall have the right to participate in
all negotiations and proceedings with respect to such demands and Parent shall
have the right to direct all negotiations and proceedings with respect to such
demands. Except with the prior written consent of Parent, the Company shall
not make any payment with respect to, or settle or offer to settle or
otherwise negotiate, any such demands, in each case, unless required by
applicable law. The applicable Common Stock Consideration and/or Preferred
Stock Consideration otherwise payable in consideration of Dissenting Shares
shall be reserved by the Shareholder Representative for settlement of any such
fair value payments hereunder with respect to the Dissenting Shares,
shall not be paid to holders of Dissenting Shares or any other Person except
as directed by Parent and shall be paid by the Shareholder Representative to
holders of Dissenting Shares promptly upon written request by Parent.



Section 2.11 _Common Stock Options, Series E Preferred Stock Options and
Series E Preferred Stock Warrants_. __



(a) As provided in Section 8.3 of the Option Plan, all outstanding unvested
Common Stock Options shall vest immediately prior to the Effective Time. The
Company shall, as soon as practicable, give notice to all holders of Common
Stock Options of the acceleration of vesting and the intended date of
expiration of such Common Stock Options. Prior to the Effective Time, the
Company shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to obtain a consent
(a " _Common Optionholder Consent_ ") from each holder of Common Stock
Options to receive the consideration referenced in this _Section 2.11(a)_ in
exchange for all of such holders Common Stock Options; _provided_ that
the failure by the Company to obtain any such Common Optionholder Consent,
despite the use of its commercially reasonable efforts to do so, shall not
result in any liability or other adverse consequence to the Company pursuant
to the terms of this Agreement, except as provided in _Section 6.2(g)_. At
the Closing, the Company shall pay to each holder of any Common Stock Option
who has executed a Common Optionholder Consent an amount of cash (less any
required withholding Tax) in respect thereof equal to (A)(x)(i) the Aggregate
Estimated Common Stock Equivalent Consideration plus the aggregate exercise
price for all vested Common Stock Options as of the Effective Time divided by
(ii) the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding as of immediately prior
to the Closing on a fully-diluted basis (excluding all shares of Common Stock
issuable upon the conversion of shares of Preferred Stock which are not so
converted, or deemed converted for purposes of the Closing Certificate,  



 

22  as of the Effective Time) minus (y) the exercise price per share of Common
Stock for such Common Stock Option multiplied by (B) the number of shares
of Common Stock issuable upon exercise of such Common Stock Option, (such
gross amount of cash, the " _Common Stock Option Initial Amount_ "). The
surrender of a Common Stock Option to the Company or the Shareholder
Representative in exchange for the appropriate Common Stock Option Initial
Amount shall be deemed a release of all rights the holder had or may have had
in respect of such Common Stock Option, except to the extent provided in
_Section 2.7(d),_ _Section 2.11(d)_ and/or _Section 9.1(b)_ hereof. Upon
receipt of the consideration provided for herein, including the Common Stock
Option Initial Amount, by the holder of a Common Stock Option, such Common
Stock Option shall be canceled.

 



(b) As provided in Section 2 of each agreement pursuant to which Series
E Preferred Stock Options were issued, all outstanding unvested Series E
Preferred Stock Options shall vest immediately prior to the Effective Time.
Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall use its commercially reasonable

Section 5.8  _Indemnification of Directors and Officers_. The articles of
incorporation and by-laws (or equivalent governing instruments) of the
Surviving Corporation and each of its Subsidiaries shall contain provisions no

of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or who were otherwise entitled to
indemnification pursuant to the Articles of Incorporation and by-laws (or
equivalent governing instruments) of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries.
The Parent shall cause to be maintained in effect for three years after the
Effective Time the current policies of the directors and officers liability
insurance maintained by the Company and its Subsidiaries with respect to
matters occurring prior to the Effective Time; _provided_ that if such
coverage cannot be obtained for 150% of the last annual premium paid prior to
the date hereof (such amount, the " _Premium Cap_ "), or less, then the
maximum amount of coverage obtainable for the Premium Cap shall be maintained;
_provided_   _further_ that the Parent may substitute therefor policies of at
least the same coverage containing terms and conditions that are not less
advantageous than the existing policies (including with respect to the period

may have against the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or any present or
former director, officer, employee or agent of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries arising or resulting from or relating to any act, omission, event
or occurrence prior to the Effective Time relating to the Company and its
Subsidiaries, except any claims pursuant to any directors and officers
liability insurance of the Company and its Subsidiaries as contemplated by
_Section 5.8_. Each Principal Shareholder further agrees never to commence,
aid, cause or authorize to be commenced (if such authority is
required) against the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or any present or
former director, officer, employee or agent of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries any action or other proceeding, whether legal or equitable,
judicial or administrative, or civil or criminal in nature, based upon or
arising out of any of the claims described in the immediately preceding
sentence, except pursuant to any directors and officers liability insurance
of the Company and its Subsidiaries as contemplated by _Section 5.8_.

to constitute a release by any Principal Shareholder of any right of such
Principal Shareholder under the Merger Documents or in connection with the
transactions contemplated therein.



Section 5.11  _Voting Agreement_. From the date hereof until the termination
of this Agreement in accordance with its terms, at any meeting of the
shareholders of the Company called to consider and vote upon any Other
Proposal (and at any and all postponements and adjournments thereof), and in

written consent of shareholders of Company, each Principal Shareholder shall
vote or cause to be voted (including by written consent, if applicable) all
of such Principal Shareholders shares of capital stock of, and other equity
interests in, the Company against such Other Proposal. Each Principal
Shareholder hereby agrees not to sell, transfer, pledge, encumber
or otherwise dispose of, or grant any proxy or power of attorney, enter into
any voting agreement with respect to, or deposit into any voting trust, any of
its Options or Series E Preferred Stock Warrants, or any of its shares of
capital stock or any of its other equity interests in, the Company. Each
Principal Shareholder hereby agrees that it shall not demand appraisal for any
of its shares of capital stock (including any shares received upon the
exercise of Options or Series E Preferred Stock Warrants) of, or other equity
interests in, the Company in connection with the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement. Each Principal Shareholder hereby agrees not to enter into any
agreement or understanding with any Person the effect of which would be
violative of the provisions and agreements contained in this _Section 5.11_.

by reason of its ownership of and involvement with the Company, such
Principal Shareholder has had access to certain Confidential Information (as
defined in the Confidentiality Agreement) relating to the business and

acknowledges that such Confidential Information is a valuable asset and
covenants that such Principal Shareholder will not, for a period of 2 years

such Confidential Information to any Person for any reason whatsoever, subject
to the same protections and disclosure exceptions that apply to Parent set
forth in the Confidentiality Agreement.

Parent and cause the Company to prepare and file, on or before the due date or

the Company shall provide to Shareholder Representative a draft of such tax
return, which shall be prepared in a manner consistent with past practice and
custom except as otherwise required by law. Within 15 days of receipt of such
draft, Shareholder Representative shall provide the Company with its
comments, if any, on such return. The Company shall incorporate any reasonable
comments of the Shareholder Representative prior to filing such tax return.
Comments of the Shareholder Representative not accepted by the Company shall
be reviewed by the Accounting Firm, whose conclusion with respect to such
comments shall be binding on the parties.



Section 5.15 _Dissenting Shares_. If the fair value paid in respect of any
Dissenting Share in accordance with the provisions of Chapter 23B.13 of the
WBCA exceeds the amount of the Common Stock Consideration or Preferred Stock
Consideration, as applicable, which would have been paid to the holder of such
Dissenting Share if such holder had not exercised such holders dissenters
rights, then the Surviving Corporation, which shall be responsible for the
payment of any such excess amount, shall have the right to collect the amount
of such excess from the Escrow Funds in the Escrow Account pursuant to
the terms of the Escrow Agreement.



Section 5.16  _Shareholder Representative_. The Principal Shareholders shall
take all actions necessary to cause Shareholder Representative to perform its

the Responsible Party does not notify the Indemnified Party within 15 days
after the receipt of the Indemnified Partys notice of a claim of indemnity
hereunder that it elects to undertake the defense thereof, the Indemnified
Party shall have the right to contest, settle or compromise, at the expense of
the Responsible Party, the claim but shall not thereby waive any right to
indemnity therefor pursuant to this Agreement. The Responsible Party shall
not, except with the consent of the Indemnified Party, enter into any
settlement that does not include as an unconditional term thereof the
giving by the person or persons asserting such claim to all Indemnified
Parties of an unconditional release from all liability with respect to such
claim or consent to entry of any judgment.



(b) All of the Parties shall cooperate in the defense or prosecution of any
Third Party Claim in respect of which indemnity may be sought hereunder and
shall furnish such records, information and testimony, and attend such
conferences, discovery proceedings, hearings, trials and appeals, as may be
reasonably requested in connection therewith.



 

52 Section 8.4 _Limitations on Indemnification Obligations_. The rights of the
Buyer Indemnitees to indemnification pursuant to the provisions of _Section
8.2(a)_ are subject to the following limitations:



(a) the amount of any and all Losses will be determined net of any amounts
actually recovered by Buyer Indemnitees under insurance policies with
respect to such Losses; _provided_ that if, following the payment of any
indemnification amounts pursuant to _Section 8.2(a)_ , Parent, Surviving
Corporation or any of their respective Affiliates recover any amounts under
insurance policies with respect to such Losses, then the applicable Buyer
Indemnitees shall reimburse the Company Securityholders of such prior
indemnification payments in the amount of such insurance recoveries;



(b) the Buyer Indemnitees shall not be entitled to recover for any
particular Loss pursuant to _Section 8.2(a)_ unless such Loss equals or
exceeds $5,000; _provided_ that (i) if a transaction or occurrence involving
the same parties produces or results in (A) a number of separate Losses of a
similar nature, or (B) a succession of similar Losses over a number of
accounting periods, or (ii) a transaction or occurrence involving multiple
parties produces or results in Losses by various parties of a similar nature,
then such separate Losses will be deemed to be aggregated for purposes of
satisfying the $5,000 threshold set forth in this _Section 8.4(b)_ ;



(c) the Buyer Indemnitees will not be entitled to recover Losses pursuant to
clauses (i), (iv) and (v) of _Section 8.2(a)_ until the total amount which
the Buyer Indemnitees would recover under clauses (i), (iv) and (v) of
_Section 8.2(a)_ (as limited by the provisions of _Sections 8.4(a)_ and
_8.4(b)_ ), but for this _Section 8.4(c)_ , exceeds the Threshold Amount, and
then only for the excess over the Threshold Amount; _provided_ that the
limitations set forth in this _Section 8.4(c)_ shall not apply to Losses
relating to breaches of representations and warranties contained in _Section
3.25_ or  _Section 3.26_ ;



(d) at any time the Buyer Indemnitees (x) will be entitled to recover no more
than the amount of cash then in the Escrow Account and (y) pursuant to this
Agreement, will not be entitled to recover Losses from any source other than
the Escrow Account;



(e) the Seller Indemnitees will not be entitled to recover Losses pursuant
to  _Section 8.2(b)(i)_ , (X) until the total amount which the Sellers
Indemnitees would recover under clause (i) of _Section 8.2(b)_ , but for this
_Section 8.4(e)_ , exceeds the Threshold and then only for the excess over the
Threshold, and (Y) in excess of $6,000,000 in the aggregate.



(f) no Indemnified Party shall have any right of indemnification hereunder
with respect to the investigation or remediation of Hazardous Substances that
have been released, disposed or discharged on any real property currently
owned or operated by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries except to the
extent that such action is required by applicable Environmental Laws, lawfully
required by a relevant Governmental Authority or where concentrations of
Hazardous Substances exceed the applicable action levels in the jurisdiction
in which the property is located. Any such investigation or remedial action
shall be conducted in a reasonable, cost effective manner (taking into account
the requirements of Environmental Law and the relevant Governmental
Authority), assuming continued commercial or industrial use of the subject
property and employing risk based standards or institutional controls where
available, provided that such controls and standards will not interfere with
the continued commercial or industrial use of the property and further
provided that the Company or its Subsidiary has the legal right to accept such
controls in connection with the subject property.



 

53 Notwithstanding anything contained herein to the contrary, absent fraud, after
the Closing, on the date that the amount of cash in the Escrow Account is
reduced to zero, the Buyer Indemnitees shall have no further rights to
indemnification under this _Article VIII_.



Section 8.5 _Exclusive Remedy_. Notwithstanding anything else contained in
this Agreement to the contrary, absent fraud, after the Closing, (i)
indemnification pursuant to the provisions of this _Article VIII_ shall be the
exclusive remedy for the parties hereto for any misrepresentation or breach of
any warranty, covenant or other provision contained in this Agreement or in
any certificate delivered pursuant hereto and (ii) making a claim for a proper
distribution from the Escrow Account shall be the sole and exclusive remedy
available to the Buyer Indemnitees for any Loss, Losses or other amounts
(including, without limitation, any relating to environmental, health or
safety matters or Tax matters) arising under the indemnification obligations
set forth herein, or otherwise in respect of the transactions contemplated
hereby.



Section 8.6 _Treatment of Indemnity Payments_. Any payments made to an
Indemnified Party pursuant to this _Article VIII_ shall be treated as an
adjustment to the Purchase Price for Tax purposes.



ARTICLE IXREPRESENTATIVE OF THE HOLDERS OF COMPANY EQUITY SECURITIES



Section 9.1 _Authorization of Representative_.



(a) Effective upon the Effective Date, as contemplated by the Shareholder
Consent, the Shareholder Representative is hereby appointed, authorized and
empowered to act as a representative for the benefit of the holders of
Preferred Stock, Common Stock, Series E Preferred Stock Warrants and Options
(other than with respect to any Dissenting Shares) (collectively, the "
_Company Equity Securities_ ") (provided that any such appointment shall only
be effective with respect to holders of Options and Series E Preferred Stock
Warrants to the extent that such holders have executed consents to such
appointment), as the exclusive agent and attorney-in-fact to act on behalf of
each holder of Company Equity Securities, in connection with and to
facilitate the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby, including
pursuant to the Escrow Agreement, which shall include the power and authority:



(i) to execute and deliver the Escrow Agreement (with such modifications or
changes therein as to which Shareholder Representative, in its sole
discretion, shall have consented) and to agree to such amendments or
modifications thereto as Shareholder Representative, in its sole discretion,
determines to be desirable;



(ii) to execute and deliver such waivers and consents in connection with this
Agreement and the Escrow Agreement and the consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby and thereby as Shareholder Representative, in its sole
discretion, may deem necessary or desirable;



(iii) as representative, to enforce and protect the rights and interests of
the holders of Company Equity Securities (including Shareholder
Representative, in its capacity as a shareholder in the Company) and to
enforce and protect the rights and interests of Shareholder Representative, in
each case arising out of or under or in any  



 

54  manner relating to this Agreement and the Escrow Agreement, and each other
agreement, document, instrument or certificate referred to herein or therein
or the transactions provided for herein or therein (including, without
limitation, in connection with any and all claims for indemnification brought
under _Article VIII_ hereof), and to take any and all actions which
Shareholder Representative believes are necessary or appropriate under either
of the Escrow Agreement and/or this Agreement for and on behalf of the holders
of Company Equity Securities, including, without limitation, asserting or
pursuing any claim, action, proceeding or investigation (a " _Claim_ ")
against Parent, Newco and/or Surviving Corporation, defending any Third Party
Claims or Claims by the Buyer Indemnitees, consenting to, compromising or
settling any such Claims, conducting negotiations with Parent, Surviving
Corporation and their respective representatives regarding such Claims, and,
in connection therewith, to (A) assert any claim or institute any action,
proceeding or investigation; (B) investigate, defend, contest or litigate
any claim, action, proceeding or investigation initiated by Parent, the
Surviving Corporation or any other person, or by any federal, state or local
Governmental Authority against Shareholder Representative and/or any of the
holders of Company Equity Securities and/or the Escrow Funds, and receive
process on behalf of any or all holders of Company Equity Securities in any
such claim, action, proceeding or investigation and compromise or settle on
such terms as Shareholder Representative shall determine to be appropriate,
and give receipts, releases and discharges with respect to, any such claim,
action, proceeding or investigation; (C) file any proofs of debt, claims and
petitions as Shareholder Representative may deem advisable or necessary; (D)
settle or compromise any claims asserted under the Escrow Agreement; and (E)
file and prosecute appeals from any decision, judgment or award rendered in
any such action, proceeding or investigation, it being understood
that Shareholder Representative shall not have any obligation to take any
such actions, and shall not have any liability for any failure to take any
such actions;



 

(iv) to refrain from enforcing any right of the holders of Company Equity
Securities or any of them and/or Shareholder Representative arising out of or
under or in any manner relating to this Agreement, the Escrow Agreement or any
other agreement, instrument or document in connection with the foregoing;
_provided_ , however, that no such failure to act on the part of Shareholder
Representative, except as otherwise provided in this Agreement or in the
Escrow Agreement, shall be deemed a waiver of any such right or interest by
Shareholder Representative or by the holders of Company Equity Securities
unless such waiver is in writing signed by the waiving party or by
Shareholder Representative;



(v) to make, execute, acknowledge and deliver all such other agreements,
guarantees, orders, receipts, endorsements, notices, requests, instructions,
certificates, stock powers, letters and other writings, and, in general, to do
any and all things and to take any and all action that Shareholder
Representative, in its sole and absolute discretion, may consider necessary or
proper or convenient in connection with or to carry out the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, the Escrow Agreement, and all other
agreements, documents or instruments referred to herein or therein or executed
in connection herewith and therewith; and



 

55 (vi) to distribute funds to holders of Company Equity Securities in accordance
with the terms of this Agreement and the Escrow Agreement.



(b) Shareholder Representative shall not be entitled to any fee, commission
or other compensation for the performance of its services hereunder, but shall
be entitled to the payment of all its expenses incurred as the representative.
At the Closing, the Shareholder Representative shall retain (x) $250,000 (the
" _Expense Funds_ ") to be used by Shareholder Representative to pay expenses
incurred by Shareholder Representative in its capacity as the representative
(and no fees or expenses shall be paid to the Shareholder Representative out
of the Escrow Account or by Parent or any of its Affiliates, except for such
Expense Funds paid at the Closing) and (y) $1,000,000 (the " _Replenishment
Funds_ ") to be used by the Shareholder Representative to replenish the
Escrow Account, if necessary, pursuant to _Section 2.7(e)_. Once Shareholder
Representative determines, in its sole discretion, that Shareholder
Representative will not incur any additional expenses in its capacity as
representative or will not have an obligation to replenish the Escrow Account
pursuant to _Section 2.7(e)_ in an amount equal to the Replenishment Funds, as
applicable, then Shareholder Representative will distribute to each holder of
Preferred Stock, Common Stock and Series E Preferred Stock Warrants, and to
the Surviving Corporation on behalf of the holders of Options, the applicable
Pro Rata Portion of the remaining unused Expense Funds or
Replenishment Funds, if any, as applicable. The Surviving Corporation shall
pay (less any required withholding Tax) to each holder of Options the
applicable Pro Rata Portion of the remaining unused Expense Funds and/or
Replenishment Funds, as applicable, paid to it by the Shareholder
Representative. In connection with this Agreement, the Escrow Agreement and
any instrument, agreement or document relating hereto or thereto, and in
exercising or failing to exercise all or any of the powers conferred
upon Shareholder Representative hereunder (i) Shareholder Representative
shall incur no responsibility whatsoever to any holders of Company Equity
Securities by reason of any error in judgment or other act or omission
performed or omitted hereunder or in connection with the Escrow Agreement or
any such other agreement, instrument or document, excepting only
responsibility for any act or failure to act which represents willful
misconduct, and (ii) Shareholder Representative shall be entitled to rely on
the advice of counsel, public accountants or other independent experts
experienced in the matter at issue, and any error in judgment or other act or
omission of Shareholder Representative pursuant to such advice shall in no
event subject Shareholder Representative to liability to any holders of
Company Equity Securities. Each holder of Company Equity Securities shall
indemnify, pro rata based upon such holders Pro Rata Portion, Shareholder
Representative against all losses, damages, liabilities, claims, obligations,
costs and expenses, including reasonable attorneys, accountants and other
experts fees and the amount of any judgment against them, of any nature
whatsoever (including, but not limited to, any and all expense whatsoever
reasonably incurred in investigating, preparing or defending against any
litigation, commenced or threatened or any claims whatsoever), arising out of
or in connection with any claim, investigation, challenge, action or
proceeding or in connection with any appeal thereof, relating to the acts or
omissions of Shareholder Representative hereunder, or under the Escrow
Agreement or otherwise. The foregoing indemnification shall not apply in the
event of any action or proceeding which finally adjudicates the liability of
Shareholder Representative hereunder for its willful misconduct. In the event
of any indemnification hereunder, upon written notice from Shareholder
Representative to the holders of Company Equity Securities as to the
existence of a deficiency toward the payment of any such indemnification
amount, each holder of Company Equity Securities shall  



 

56  promptly deliver to Shareholder Representative full payment of his or her
ratable share of the amount of such deficiency based upon such holders
Pro Rata Portion.



(c) All of the indemnities, immunities and powers granted to Shareholder
Representative under this Agreement shall survive the Effective Date and/or
any termination of this Agreement and/or the Escrow Agreement.



(d) Subject to the receipt of the consents referenced in _Section 9.1(a)_ ,
Parent and Surviving Corporation shall have the right to rely upon all
actions taken or omitted to be taken by Shareholder Representative pursuant to
this Agreement, the Escrow Agreement or any other agreement, instrument or
document entered into in connection with this Agreement, all of which actions
or omissions, including, but not limited to, the disbursements of funds to
holders of Company Equity Security holders as contemplated herein, by the
Shareholder Representative shall be legally binding upon the holders of
Company Equity Securities, and Parent, Surviving Corporation and their
Affiliates are hereby relieved from any liability to any Person for any acts
done by them in accordance with any such action or failure to act by
Shareholder Representative.



(e) The grant of authority provided for in this _Article IX_ (i) is coupled
with an interest and shall be irrevocable and survive the death, incompetency,
bankruptcy or liquidation of any holder of Company Equity Securities; and (ii)
shall survive the consummation of the Merger.



(f) Should Shareholder Representative resign or be unable to
serve, Shareholder Representative shall appoint a single substitute agent to
take on the responsibility of Shareholder Representative hereunder, whose
appointment shall be effective on the date of Shareholder Representatives
resignation or incapacity.
