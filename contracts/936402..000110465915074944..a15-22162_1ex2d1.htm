wholly owned subsidiary of Parent (" _Merger Sub_ ," with the Company and
Merger Sub sometimes being hereinafter collectively referred to as the "
_Constituent Corporations_ **"** ) and Shire plc, a company incorporated in
Jersey (" _Parent Holdco_ ").

 



 

RECITALS

 



 

WHEREAS, the board of directors of the Company has unanimously (i) approved
and declared advisable this Agreement and the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement, including the merger of Merger Sub with and into the Company,
with the Company being the surviving corporation (the " _Merger_ "), upon the
terms and subject to the conditions set forth herein, (ii) determined that
this Agreement and such transactions are fair to, and in the best interests
of, the Company and its stockholders (other than Parent Holdco, Parent and its
Subsidiaries) and (iii) resolved to recommend that the Companys stockholders
approve the adoption of this Agreement;

 



 

WHEREAS, each of the boards of directors of Parent Holdco, Parent and Merger
Sub has (i) approved and declared advisable this Agreement and the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including the Merger, upon the
terms and subject to the conditions set forth herein and (ii) determined that
this Agreement and such transactions are fair to, and in the best interests
of, Parent Holdco, Parent and Merger Sub, respectively;

 



 

WHEREAS, Parent, as the sole stockholder of Merger Sub, shall, on the date
hereof immediately following execution and delivery of this Agreement, adopt
this Agreement and approve the transactions contemplated by this Agreement,
including the Merger;

 



 

WHEREAS, subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, at or prior to
the Effective Time (as defined below), Parent Holdco and a rights agent
mutually agreeable to Parent Holdco and the Company (the " _Rights Agent_ ")
will enter into a Contingent Value Rights Agreement in substantially the form
attached hereto as _EXHIBIT C_ (subject to changes permitted by _Section
6.3(c)_) (the " _CVR Agreement_ "); and

 



 

WHEREAS, the Company, Parent Holdco, Parent and Merger Sub desire to make
certain representations, warranties, covenants and agreements in connection
with this Agreement.

 



 

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the premises, and of the representations,
warranties, covenants and agreements contained herein, the parties hereto
agree as follows:

      
 

 



 

ARTICLE I

 



 

 _The Merger; Closing; Effective Time_

 



 

1.1 _The Merger_. Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in
this Agreement, and in accordance with the General Corporation Law of the
State of Delaware (the " _DGCL_ "), at the Effective Time, Merger Sub shall be
merged with and into the Company and the separate corporate existence of
Merger Sub shall thereupon cease. The Company shall be the surviving
corporation in the Merger (sometimes hereinafter referred to as the "
_Surviving Corporation_ "), and the separate corporate existence of the
Company, with all of its rights, privileges, immunities, powers and franchises
shall continue unaffected by the Merger, except as set forth in _ARTICLE II_.
The Merger shall have the effects specified in the DGCL.

 



 

 **1.2** _Closing_. Unless otherwise mutually agreed in writing between the
Company and Parent, the closing for the Merger (the " _Closing_ ") shall take
place at the offices of Sullivan and Cromwell LLP, 125 Broad Street, New York,
New York on the third (3rd) business day, or such other place and time as
mutually agreed upon in writing by the parties hereto (the " _Closing Date_
"), following the day on which the last to be satisfied or waived of the
conditions set forth in _ARTICLE VII_ (other than those conditions that by
their nature are to be satisfied at or immediately prior to the Closing, but
subject to the fulfillment or waiver of those conditions) shall be satisfied
or waived in accordance with this Agreement. As used in this Agreement, the
term " _business day_ " means any day other than a Saturday or a Sunday or a
day on which commercial banks are authorized or required by Law or executive
order to be closed in New York City.

 



 

1.3 _Effective Time_. As soon as practicable following the Closing, the
Company, Parent and Merger Sub will cause a certificate of merger (the "
_Certificate of Merger_ ") to be executed, acknowledged and filed with the
Secretary of State of the State of Delaware. The Merger shall become effective
at the time when the Certificate of Merger has been duly filed with the
Secretary of State of the State of Delaware or at such later time as may be
agreed by the parties in writing and specified in the Certificate of Merger
(the " _Effective Time_ ").

 



 

ARTICLE II

 



 

 _Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws 
of the Surviving Corporation_

 



 

2.1 _The Certificate of Incorporation_. At the Effective Time, the certificate
of incorporation of the Company (the " _Charter_ ") shall be amended and
restated in its entirety to read as set forth in _EXHIBIT A_ hereto, and such
amended and restated Charter shall serve as the certificate of incorporation
of the Surviving Corporation until thereafter amended as provided therein or
by applicable Law.

 



 

2.2 _The Bylaws_. The parties hereto shall take all actions necessary so that
the bylaws of the Company in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time
shall be amended and restated in their entirety to read as set forth in
_EXHIBIT B_ hereto, and such amended and

 



      
 

 



 

restated Bylaws shall serve as the bylaws of the Surviving Corporation (the "
_Bylaws_ "), until thereafter amended as provided therein or by applicable
Law.

 



 

ARTICLE III

 



 

 _Directors and Officers of the Surviving Corporation_

 



 

3.1 _Directors_. The parties hereto shall take all actions necessary so that
the board of directors of Merger Sub at the Effective Time shall, from and
after the Effective Time, be the directors of the Surviving Corporation until
their successors have been duly elected or appointed and qualified or until
their earlier death, resignation or removal in accordance with the Charter and
the Bylaws.

 



 

3.2 _Officers_. The officers of the Company at the Effective Time shall, from
and after the Effective Time, be the officers of the Surviving Corporation
until their successors shall have been duly elected or appointed and qualified

Charter and the Bylaws.

 



 

ARTICLE IV

 



 

 _Effect of the Merger on Capital Stock; 
Exchange of Certificates_

 



 

4.1 _Effect on Capital Stock_. At the Effective Time, as a result of the
Merger and without any action on the part of the holder of any capital stock
of the Company or on the part of the sole stockholder of Merger Sub:

 



 

(a) _Merger Consideration_. Each outstanding share of common stock, par value
$0.01 per share, of the Company (each a " _Share_ " and, collectively, the "
_Shares_ ") issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time
other than (i) Shares owned by Parent, Merger Sub or any other direct or
indirect wholly owned Subsidiary of Parent and Shares owned by the Company,
and in each case not held on behalf of third parties, and (ii) Shares that are
owned by stockholders (" _Dissenting Stockholders_ ") who have perfected and
not withdrawn a demand for (or lost their right to) appraisal rights pursuant
to Section 262 of the DGCL (each Share referred to in clause (i) or clause
(ii) of this _Section 4.1(a)_ being an " _Excluded Share_ " and,
collectively, " _Excluded Shares_ ") shall be converted into the right to
receive (I) an amount in cash equal to $37.30 (the " _Per Share Cash
Consideration_ ") and (II) one (1) contractual contingent value right pursuant
to the CVR Agreement (a " _CVR_ "), in each case, without interest thereon
((I) and (II) collectively, the " _Per Share Merger Consideration_ "). At the
Effective Time, all of the Shares shall cease to be outstanding, shall be
cancelled and shall cease to exist, and each certificate (a " _Certificate_ ")
formerly representing any of the Shares (other than Excluded Shares) and each
non-certificated Share represented by book-entry (a " _Book-Entry Share_ ")
(other than Excluded Shares) shall thereafter represent only the right to
receive the Per Share Merger Consideration, without interest.

 



 

(b) _Treatment of Excluded Shares_. Each Share that is an Excluded Share
pursuant to clause (ii) of the definition thereof, by virtue of the Merger and
without any action on

 



      
 

 



 

the part of the holder thereof, shall cease to be outstanding, shall be
cancelled without payment of any consideration therefor and shall cease to
exist, subject to any rights the holder thereof may have under _Section
4.2(g)_. Each Share that is an Excluded Share pursuant to clause (i) of the
definition thereof shall remain outstanding and shall be unaffected by the
Merger.

 



 

(c) _Merger Sub_. At the Effective Time, each share of common stock, par value
$0.001 per share, of Merger Sub issued and outstanding immediately prior to
the Effective Time shall be converted into one (1) share of common stock, par
value $0.01 per share, of the Surviving Corporation.

 



 

4.2 _Exchange of Shares_.

 



 

(a) _Paying Agent_. At or immediately prior to the Effective Time, Parent
shall deposit, or shall cause to be deposited, with a paying agent selected by
Parent with the Companys prior approval (such approval not to be unreasonably
withheld or delayed) (the " _Paying Agent_ "), for the benefit of the former
holders of Shares, a cash amount in immediately available funds necessary for
the Paying Agent to make payments under _Section 4.1(a)_ in respect of the
Per Share Cash Consideration (such cash amount being hereinafter referred to
as the " _Exchange Fund_ "). For the avoidance of doubt, Parent shall not be
required to deposit any funds related to any CVR with the Rights Agent unless
and until such deposit is required pursuant to the CVR Agreement. The Paying
Agent agreement pursuant to which Parent shall appoint the Paying Agent shall
be in form and substance reasonably acceptable to the Company. The Paying
Agent shall invest the cash in the Exchange Fund as directed by Parent;
_provided_ that such investments shall be in obligations of or guaranteed by
the United States of America, in commercial paper obligations rated A-1 or P-1
or better by Moodys Investors Service, Inc. or Standard and Poors Financial
Services LLC, respectively, in certificates of deposit, bank repurchase
agreements or bankers acceptances of commercial banks with capital exceeding
$1 billion, or in money market funds having a rating in the highest investment
category granted by a recognized credit rating agency at the time of
investment. Any interest and other income resulting from such investment shall
become a part of the Exchange Fund, and any amounts in excess of the amounts
payable under _Section 4.1(a)_ shall be promptly returned to the Surviving
Corporation. To the extent that there are any losses with respect to any such
investments, or the Exchange Fund diminishes for any reason below the level
required for the Paying Agent to make prompt cash payment under _Section
4.1(a)_, Parent shall, or shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, promptly
replace or restore the cash in the Exchange Fund so as to ensure that the
Exchange Fund is at all times maintained at a level sufficient for the Paying
Agent to make such payments under _Section 4.1(a)_. If any holder of Shares
that are Excluded Shares pursuant to clause (ii) of the definition thereof
shall fail to perfect or otherwise shall waive, validly withdraw or lose the
right to appraisal under Section 262 of the DGCL with respect to any of such
holders Excluded Shares, or a court of competent jurisdiction shall determine
that such holder is not entitled to the relief provided by Section 262 of the
DGCL with respect to any of such holders Excluded Shares, then Parent shall
deposit with the Paying Agent cash in an amount sufficient to pay the
aggregate Per Share Cash Consideration as required to be paid pursuant to this
Agreement with respect to such Excluded Shares, and the Exchange Fund shall be
deemed to include the cash so deposited.

 



       
 

 



 

(b) _Exchange Procedures_.

 



 

(i) Promptly after the Effective Time (and in any event within five (5)
business days thereafter), the Surviving Corporation shall cause the Paying
Agent to mail to each holder of record of a Certificate representing Shares
(other than holders of Excluded Shares) (A) a letter of transmittal in
customary form specifying that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss
and title to the Certificates shall pass, only upon delivery of the
Certificates (or affidavits of loss in lieu thereof as provided in _Section
4.2(e)_) to the Paying Agent, such letter of transmittal to be in such form
and have such other provisions as Parent and the Company may reasonably agree,
and (B) instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the Certificates
(or affidavits of loss in lieu thereof as provided in _Section 4.2(e)_) in
exchange for the Per Share Merger Consideration. Upon surrender of a
Certificate (or affidavit of loss in lieu thereof as provided in _Section
4.2(e)_) to the Paying Agent in accordance with the terms of such letter of
transmittal, duly executed, the holder of such Certificate shall be entitled
to receive in exchange therefor (I) a cash amount in immediately available
funds (after giving effect to any required Tax withholdings as provided in
_Section 4.2(h)_) equal to (x) the number of Shares represented by such
Certificate (or affidavit of loss in lieu thereof as provided in _Section
4.2(e)_) multiplied by (y) the Per Share Cash Consideration and (II) one (1)
CVR for each Share represented by such Certificate (or affidavit of loss in
lieu thereof as provided in _Section 4.2(e)_) in accordance with and subject
to the CVR Agreement, and the Certificate so surrendered shall forthwith be
cancelled. No interest will be paid or accrued on any amount payable upon due
surrender of the Certificates. In the event of a transfer of ownership of
Shares that is not registered in the transfer records of the Company, a check
for any cash to be exchanged upon due surrender of the Certificate may be
issued to such transferee (after giving effect to any required Tax
withholdings as provided in _Section 4.2(h)_) if the Certificate formerly
representing such Shares is presented to the Paying Agent, accompanied by all
documents reasonably required to evidence and effect such transfer and to
evidence that any and all transfer and other Taxes required by reason of the
issuance to such transferee have been paid or are not applicable.

 



 

(ii) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, any holder of
Book-Entry Shares shall not be required to deliver a Certificate or an
executed letter of transmittal to the Paying Agent to receive the Per Share
Merger Consideration that such holder is entitled to receive pursuant to this
_ARTICLE IV_. In lieu thereof, each holder of record of one or more Book-
Entry Shares whose Shares were converted into the right to receive the Per
Share Merger Consideration shall upon receipt by the Paying Agent of an
"agents message" in customary form (or such other evidence, if any, as the
Paying Agent may reasonably request), be entitled to receive, and Parent shall
cause the Paying Agent to pay and deliver as promptly as reasonably
practicable after the Effective Time, the Per Share Merger Consideration in
respect of each such Share, and the Book-Entry Shares of such holder shall
forthwith be cancelled.

 



 

(c) _Transfers_. From and after the Effective Time, there shall be no
transfers on the stock transfer books of the Company of the Shares that were
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time. If, after the Effective
Time, any Certificate or Book-Entry Share is

 



      
 

 



 

presented to the Surviving Corporation, Parent or the Paying Agent for
transfer, it shall be cancelled and exchanged for the cash amount in
immediately available funds and the CVRs to which the holder thereof is
entitled pursuant to this _ARTICLE IV_.

 



 

(d) _Termination of Exchange Fund_. Any portion of the Exchange Fund
(including the proceeds of any investments thereof) that remains unclaimed by
the stockholders of the Company 180 days after the Effective Time shall be
delivered to the Surviving Corporation. Any holder of Shares (other than
Excluded Shares) who has not theretofore complied with this _ARTICLE IV_
shall thereafter look only to the Surviving Corporation for payment and
delivery of the Per Share Merger Consideration (after giving effect to any
required Tax withholdings as provided in _Section 4.2(h)_) upon due surrender
of its Certificates (or affidavits of loss in lieu thereof as provided in
_Section 4.2(e)_) or Book-Entry Shares, without any interest thereon.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, none of the Surviving Corporation, Parent, the
Paying Agent or any other Person shall be liable to any former holder of
Shares for any amount properly delivered to a public official pursuant to
applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar Laws. If the consideration
owed to a former holder of Shares has not been paid prior to the date on which
such consideration would otherwise escheat to, or become the property of, any
Governmental Entity, any such consideration shall, to the extent permitted by
applicable Law, immediately prior to such time become the property of Parent,
free and clear of all claims or interest of any Person previously entitled
thereto. For the purposes of this Agreement, the term " _Person_ " shall mean
any individual, corporation (including not-for-profit), general or limited
partnership, limited liability company, joint venture, estate, trust,
association, organization, Governmental Entity or other entity of any kind or
nature.

 



 

(e) _Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates_. In the event any Certificate
shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of
that fact by the Person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or
destroyed and, if required by Parent or the Paying Agent, the posting by such
Person of a bond in customary amount and upon such terms as may be reasonably
required by Parent or the Paying Agent as indemnity against any claim that may
be made against it or the Surviving Corporation with respect to such
Certificate, following compliance with the procedures set forth in _Section
4.1(b)_, the Paying Agent will (I) issue a check in the amount (after giving
effect to any required Tax withholdings as provided in _Section 4.2(h)_)
equal to (i) the number of Shares represented by such lost, stolen or
destroyed Certificate multiplied by (ii) the Per Share Cash Consideration and
(II) one (1) CVR for each Share represented by such lost, stolen or destroyed
Certificate in accordance with and subject to the CVR Agreement.

 



 

(f) _No Fractional CVRs_. No fraction of a CVR will be issued in connection
with the Merger or any other transaction contemplated by this Agreement and
the CVR Agreement, and no certificates or scrip for any such fractional CVR
shall be issued. Each holder of Shares who would otherwise be entitled to
receive a fraction of a CVR pursuant to this Agreement, after aggregating all
fractional CVRs to be received by such holder (a " _Fractional CVR_ "), shall,
upon surrender of such holders Shares, receive one (1) CVR in exchange for
such Fractional CVR if the amount of such Fractional CVR is greater than or
equal to 0.50 or no consideration for such Fractional CVR if the amount of
such Fractional CVR is less than 0.50.

 



      
 

 



 

(g) _Appraisal Rights_. No Person who has perfected a demand for appraisal
rights pursuant to Section 262 of the DGCL shall be entitled to receive the
Per Share Merger Consideration with respect to the Shares owned by such Person
unless and until such Person shall have effectively withdrawn or lost such
Persons right to appraisal under the DGCL. Each Dissenting Stockholder shall
be entitled to receive only the payment provided by Section 262 of the DGCL
with respect to Shares owned by such Dissenting Stockholder. The Company shall
give Parent (i) prompt notice of any written demands for appraisal, attempted
withdrawals of such demands, and any other instruments served pursuant to
applicable Law that are received by the Company relating to stockholders
rights of appraisal and (ii) the opportunity to participate in all
negotiations and proceedings with respect to any such demand for appraisal
under the DGCL. Parent shall have the right to direct all negotiation with the
Dissenting Stockholder(s) and the Company shall not, except with the prior
written consent of Parent, voluntarily make any payment with respect to any
demands for appraisal, offer to settle or settle any such demands.

 



 

(h) _Withholding Rights_. Parent (or, as directed by Parent, any of the
Company, the Surviving Corporation, the Paying Agent or the Rights Agent)
shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the consideration otherwise
payable pursuant to this Agreement or the CVR Agreement to any holder of
Shares, Company Options (as defined in _Section 4.3(a)_) and Company RSUs (as
defined in _Section 4.3(b)_) such amounts as it reasonably determines is
required to deduct and withhold with respect to the making of such payment
under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the " _Code_ "), or any
other applicable state, local or foreign Tax Law. To the extent that amounts
are so withheld by the Company, the Surviving Corporation, Parent or the
Paying Agent, as the case may be, such withheld amounts (i) shall be remitted
by the Company, Parent, the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent, as
applicable, to the applicable Governmental Entity, and (ii) shall be treated
for all purposes of this Agreement and the CVR Agreement as having been paid
to the holder of Shares, Company Options or Company RSUs in respect of which
such deduction and withholding was made by the Company, the Surviving
Corporation, Parent or the Paying Agent, as the case may be.

or be in good standing, has not had and would not reasonably be expected to
have, individually or in the aggregate, a Company Material Adverse Effect. The
Company has made available to Parent complete and correct copies of the

expected to have (a) a material adverse effect on the condition (financial or
otherwise), business, assets, liabilities or results of operations of the
Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole; _provided_ , _however_ , that

(D) any regulatory, legislative or political conditions or securities, credit,
financial or other capital markets conditions, in each case in the United

shall not prevent or otherwise affect a determination that any change, effect
or development underlying such failure has resulted in or contributed to a
Company Material Adverse Effect, subject to the other sub-clauses of clause
(a) of this definition);

 



 

(F) the execution and delivery of this Agreement (except to the extent such
change, effect or development was the result of a breach of _Section
5.1(d)(ii))_, the

 



      
 

 



 

performance by any party hereto of its obligations hereunder or the public

relationships, contractual or otherwise, of the Company or any Subsidiary with
its employees or with any other third party;

Adverse Effect pursuant to clause (a) above to the extent such effect, change,

disproportionate adverse effect on the Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as
a whole, relative to the adverse effect that such changes have on other
biopharmaceutical companies.

 



 

(b) _Capital Structure_. The authorized capital stock of the Company consists
of 201,000,000 Shares, of which 147,128,033 Shares were outstanding as of the

Benefit Plan listed on _Section 5.1(h)_ of the Company Disclosure Letter, the
Company has made available to Parent true and complete copies of (in each
case, if applicable): (i) the Benefit Plan document (or a written description
if such Benefit Plan is not set forth in a written document), (ii) the most
recent summary plan description with respect to the Benefit Plan, (iii) any
related trust, insurance policy or other funding vehicle (including any stop
loss policy), (iv) the most recent actuarial or other valuation reports and
audited financial statements, to the extent applicable, (v) all material
correspondence with any Governmental Entity regarding the Benefit Plan, and
(vi) the most recent determination or opinion letter received from the
Internal Revenue Service (the " _IRS_ ") with respect to each Benefit Plan
intended to qualify under Section 401 of Code.

 



 

(ii) All Benefit Plans are in compliance with their terms and ERISA, the Code
and other applicable Laws. None of the Benefit Plans are maintained by the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries outside of the United States primarily for
the benefit of employees of the Company and its Subsidiaries working outside
of the United States. Each Benefit Plan that is subject to ERISA (an " _ERISA
Plan_ ") that is an "employee pension benefit plan" within the meaning of
Section 3(2) of ERISA intended to be qualified under Section 401(a) of the
Code has received a favorable determination or opinion letter from the
Internal Revenue Service upon which it can rely or has applied to the IRS for
such favorable determination or opinion letter under Section 401(b) of the
Code, and nothing has occurred with respect each such Benefit Plan which would
reasonably be expected to cause the loss of such qualification or exemption.
Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has engaged in a transaction
with respect to any ERISA Plan that would reasonably be expected to subject
the Company or any Subsidiary to a tax or penalty imposed by either Section
4975 of the Code or Section 502(i) of ERISA in an amount which would be
material to the Company and its Subsidiaries taken as a whole.

 



 

(iii) Neither the Company nor any entity which is considered one employer with
the Company under Section 4001 of ERISA or Section 414 of the Code (an "
_ERISA Affiliate_ ") has, at any time during the last six (6) years,
contributed to, been obligated to contribute to or otherwise had any liability
in respect of any plan that is subject to Section 412 of the Code or Section
302 or Title IV of ERISA, including any plan that is a "multiemployer plan"
within the meaning of Section 3(37) of ERISA (a " _Multiemployer Plan_ "), and
neither the Company nor any ERISA Affiliate has incurred any liability to a
Multiemployer Plan as a result of a complete or partial withdrawal (as those
terms are defined in Part I of Subtitle E of Title IV of ERISA) from a
Multiemployer Plan.

 



 

(iv) As of the date hereof, there is no material pending or, to the Knowledge
of the Company, threatened, complaint, claim, action, charge, suit,
arbitration, mediation, proceeding, audit or litigation (" _Action_ ")
relating to the Benefit Plans, other than routine claims for benefits. Except
to the extent required by Section 4980B of the Code and at the participants
sole expense, no Benefit Plan provides medical, surgical, hospitalization,
death or similar benefits (whether or not insured) for current or former
employees, directors or independent contractors (or any dependent

 



      
 

 



 

thereof) of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries for periods extending
beyond the termination of such persons service with the Company and its
Subsidiaries.

 



 

(v) Neither the execution of this Agreement, nor the consummation of the
Merger, whether alone or in conjunction with any other event, will (A) entitle
any current or former director, employee, or independent contractor of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries to severance pay or any material increase
in severance pay upon any termination of employment after the date hereof
(other than severance pay required by any Law) or (B) except as set forth in
_Section 4.3_ of this Agreement, accelerate the time of payment or vesting or
result in any material increase in, or funding (through a grantor trust or
otherwise) of, compensation or benefits under, or result in any other material
obligation pursuant to, any of the Benefit Plans. No payment or benefit paid
or provided, or to be paid or provided, whether contingent or otherwise, to
any "disqualified individual" (as defined in Section 280G of the Code) of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries (including pursuant to this Agreement) will
fail to be deductible for federal income tax purposes due to the application
of Section 280G of the Code. No Benefit Plan or other agreement or arrangement
with any Person provides for a "gross-up" or similar payment in respect of any
Taxes that may become payable as result of the application of Section 409A or
Section 4999 of the Code.

 



 

(i) _Labor Matters_.

 



 

(i) As of the date of this Agreement: (I) neither the Company nor any of its
Subsidiaries is a party to or otherwise bound by, or negotiating, any
collective bargaining agreement or other Contract with a labor union, or
employee representative organization or works council (" _Collective
Bargaining Agreements_ ") and no employees of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries are represented by any labor union, employee representative
organization or works council in connection with their employment with the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries, (II) neither the Company nor any of its
Subsidiaries is the subject of any proceeding, charge or complaint asserting
that the Company or any of its Subsidiaries has committed an unfair labor
practice or seeking to compel it or them to bargain with any labor union or
labor organization and (III) there is no pending or, to the Knowledge of the
Company, threatened, labor strike, material slowdown, picketing, walk-out,
work stoppage or lockout involving the Company or any of its Subsidiaries; and
neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has experienced any such labor
strike, material slowdown, picketing, walk-out, work stoppage or lockout
within the past two (2) years. No notice, consent or consultation obligations
with respect to any employees of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or any
labor union, employee representative organizations or works council, will be
triggered by the execution of this Agreement or the consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby.

 



 

(ii) The Company and each of its Subsidiaries are, and for the past three (3)
years have been, in compliance with all applicable Laws relating to the
employment and other engagement of labor (including, employment and labor
standards, immigration, employee and other service provider classification
(including under the Fair Labor Standards Act and similar state Laws and for
purposes of eligibility to participate in Benefit Plans), the provision of and
contributions to statutory benefits, labor relations

 



      
 

 



 

and negotiation and consultation with employee representative bodies,
occupational health and safety, human rights, workers compensation, severance
payments and the provision of notice, employment equity, pay equity, wages,
hours and medical leave), except where the failure to comply with such Laws
has not had, and would not reasonably be expected to have, individually or in
the aggregate, a Company Material Adverse Effect. No material Action with
respect to employment matters is now pending or, to the Knowledge of the
Company, threatened against the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, by or
before any Governmental Entity, and there is no material Action by or before
any Governmental Entity with respect to a violation of any occupational safety
or health standards that is now pending or, to the Knowledge of the Company,
threatened against the Company or any of its Subsidiaries.

 



 

(j) _Compliance with Laws; Licenses_.

 



 

(i) The businesses of each of the Company and its Subsidiaries have not been
since the Applicable Date, and are not being, conducted in violation of any
federal, state, local or foreign law, statute or ordinance, common law, or any
rule, regulation, standard, judgment, order, writ, injunction, decree,
arbitration award, agency requirement, license or permit of any Governmental
Entity (collectively, " _Laws_ "), except for violations that, individually or
in the aggregate, would not reasonably be expected to be material to the
Company taken as a whole. Except with respect to regulatory matters covered by
_Section 6.3(g)_, no investigation, review or enforcement by any Governmental
Entity with respect to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is pending or,
to the Knowledge of the Company, threatened, nor has any Governmental Entity
indicated an intention to conduct the same, except for such investigations or
reviews, the outcome of which would not reasonably be expected to material to
the Company taken as whole. The Company and each of its Subsidiaries has
obtained and is in compliance with all permits, certifications, approvals,
registrations, consents, authorizations, franchises, variances, exemptions and
orders issued or granted by a Governmental Entity (" _Licenses_ ") necessary
to conduct its business as presently conducted, except those the absence of
which would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to
be material to the Company taken as a whole.

 



 

(ii) In the past five years, none of the Company, any of its Subsidiaries, or
any of their respective directors, officers, consultants, or to the Knowledge
of the Company, agents or other Persons acting for or on their behalf has (i)
taken any action that would result in a violation in any material respect by
such Person of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (15 U.S.C. §§ 78m(b), 78dd-1,
78dd-2, 78ff) (the " _FCPA_ "), The Bribery Act of 2010 of the United Kingdom,
or any other applicable Law related to anti-corruption or anti-bribery (but,
in each case, only to the extent such applicable Law is applicable to the
foregoing Persons), (ii) made, offered to make, promised to make or authorized
the payment or giving of, directly or indirectly, any unlawful payment or gift
of money or anything of value prohibited under any applicable Law concerning
such payments or gifts in any jurisdiction (any such payment, a " _Prohibited
Payment_ ") and (iii) to the Companys Knowledge, been subject to any
investigation by any Governmental Entity with regard to any Prohibited
Payment. The Company has instituted and maintained policies and procedures
designed to prevent such

 



      
 

 



 

Persons from taking such actions (but, in each case, only to the extent such
applicable Law is applicable to the Company or such Persons).

 



 

(k) _Material Contracts_.

material fact required to be disclosed to any Health Authority, or committed
an act, made a statement, or failed to make a statement, including with

received the opinion of its financial advisor, Centerview Partners LLC, that
as of the date of such opinion, and based upon and subject to the various

forth therein, consideration, consisting of the Per Share Cash Consideration,
together (and not separately) with one CVR, to be paid to the holders of

pursuant to this Agreement is fair from a financial point of view, to such

the Companys board of directors and may not be relied on by Parent Holdco,
Parent or Merger Sub; provided, however, the Company shall forward to Parent,
solely for informational purposes, a copy of the written version of such
opinion promptly following the execution of this Agreement and in no event
later than three (3) business days after the date of this Agreement.

sent or given to the Companys stockholders, contain any statement that, in
light of the circumstances under which it is made, is false or misleading with
respect to any material fact or omits to state any material fact required to

 



      
 

 



 

be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in
light of the circumstances under which they are made, not false or misleading,
except that no representation or warranty is made by the Company with respect
to statements made or incorporated by reference in the Proxy Statement based
on information supplied by Parent Holdco, Parent or Merger Sub specifically

6.2 _Acquisition Proposals_.

 



 

(a) _No Solicitation or Negotiation_. The Company agrees that, except as

_Representatives_ ") not to, directly or indirectly:

 



      
 

 



 

(i) initiate, solicit or knowingly encourage any inquiries or the making of
any proposal or offer that constitutes, or would reasonably be expected to
lead to, any Acquisition Proposal;

 



 

(ii) engage in, continue or otherwise participate in any discussions or
negotiations regarding, or provide or make available any non-public

on which the Company Requisite Vote is obtained, but not after, the Company

therefor by a Person who has made a _bona fide_ written Acquisition Proposal
if (1) such Acquisition Proposal did not result from a knowing or intentional
breach of the Companys obligations under this _Section 6.2_ and (2) the
Company receives from the Person so requesting such information an executed
confidentiality agreement on terms that, taken as a whole, are not less
restrictive to the other party than those contained in the Confidentiality
Agreement and the Company complies with the Confidentiality Agreement; it
being understood that such confidentiality agreement must include a standstill
provision, but need not prohibit the making, or amendment, of a private
Acquisition Proposal; and (3) the Company promptly (but in any event within
twenty-four (24) hours of providing such information) discloses (and, if
applicable, provides copies of) any such information to Parent to the extent
not previously disclosed or provided to Parent; (B) engage or participate in

fide_ written Acquisition Proposal, subject to the conditions set forth in

authorize, adopt, approve, recommend, or otherwise declare advisable or
propose to authorize, adopt, approve, recommend or declare advisable (publicly
or otherwise) such an Acquisition Proposal, if and only to the extent that,
(x) prior to taking any action described in clause (A), (B) or (C) above, the
board of directors of the Company, or any committee thereof, determines in
good faith that failure to take such action would reasonably be expected to be
inconsistent with the directors fiduciary duties under applicable Law, (y) in
each such case referred to in clause (A) or (B) above, the board of directors
of the Company, or any committee thereof, has determined in good faith based
on the information then available that such Acquisition Proposal either
constitutes a Superior Proposal or is reasonably likely to result in a
Superior Proposal, and (z) in the case referred to in clause (C) above, the
board of directors of the Company, or any committee thereof, determines in
good faith that such Acquisition Proposal is a Superior Proposal.

 



      
 

 



 

(b) _Definitions_. For purposes of this Agreement:

 



 

" _Acquisition Proposal_ " means (i) any proposal or offer with respect to a
merger, joint venture, partnership, consolidation, dissolution, liquidation,
tender offer, recapitalization, reorganization, share exchange, business
combination or similar transaction involving the Company and/or any of its
Subsidiaries or (ii) any direct or indirect acquisition by any Person
resulting in, or proposal or offer, which if consummated would result in, any
Person becoming the beneficial owner, directly or indirectly, in one or a
series of related transactions, of 15% or more of the total voting power or of
any class of equity securities of the Company, or 15% or more of the
consolidated total assets (including equity securities of its Subsidiaries) of
the Company, in the case of each of clause (i) and clause (ii) of this
_Section 6.2(b)_, other than the Merger.

 



 

" _Superior Proposal_ " means a _bona fide_ Acquisition Proposal that would
result in any Person becoming the beneficial owner, directly or indirectly, of
more than 50% of the assets (on a consolidated basis) or more than 50% of the
total voting power of the equity securities of the Company that the board of
directors of the Company has determined in its good faith judgment (after
taking into account any revisions to the terms of the transaction contemplated
by _Section 6.2(c)_ of this Agreement and taking into account the timing,
likelihood of consummation, legal, financial, regulatory and other aspects of
such Acquisition Proposal) is likely to be consummated and would, if
consummated, result in a transaction more favorable to the Companys
stockholders from a financial point of view than the Merger.

 



 

(c) _No Change in Recommendation or Alternative Acquisition Agreement_. The
board of directors of the Company and each committee of the board of directors
of the Company shall not:

 



 

(i) withhold, withdraw, qualify or modify, or resolve or publicly propose to
withhold, withdraw, qualify or modify in a manner adverse to Parent, the
Company Recommendation with respect to the Merger ( _it being understood_ that
the board of directors of the Company may take no position with respect to an
Acquisition Proposal proposed through a tender offer or exchange offer until
the close of business on the tenth (10th) business day after the commencement
of such Acquisition Proposal pursuant to Rule 14d-2 under the Exchange Act
without such action being considered an adverse modification); or

 



 

(ii) except as expressly permitted by, and after compliance with, this
_Section 6.2(c)_, cause or permit the Company to enter into any acquisition
agreement, merger agreement or similar definitive agreement (other than a
confidentiality agreement entered into in compliance with _Section 6.2(a)_)
(an " _Alternative Acquisition Agreement_ ") relating to any Acquisition
Proposal.

 



 

Notwithstanding anything in the foregoing to the contrary, prior to the date
on which the Company Requisite Vote is obtained, but not after, the board of
directors of the Company may (A) withhold, withdraw, qualify or modify the
Company Recommendation,

 



      
 

 



 

(B) fail to include the Company Recommendation in the Proxy Statement, (C)
following a publicly announced or disclosed _bona fide_ Acquisition Proposal
(other than an Acquisition Proposal that is a tender offer or exchange offer)
fail to reaffirm or republish without qualification or modification the
Company Recommendation within ten (10) business days following the receipt of
a written request to do so from Parent or (D) approve, recommend or otherwise
declare advisable any Superior Proposal made after the date of this Agreement,
if (i) solely in a circumstance where any of the foregoing actions is in
respect of an Acquisition Proposal, an Acquisition Proposal (with all
references to "15%" in the definition of Acquisition Proposal being deemed to
be references to "50%" for the purposes of usage of such term in this _Section
6.2(c)_) has been made, the board of directors of the Company determines in
good faith that such Acquisition Proposal constitutes a Superior Proposal and
(ii) in all cases the board of directors of the Company determines in good
faith that failure to do so would reasonably be expected to be inconsistent
with its fiduciary obligations under applicable Law (a " _Change of
Recommendation_ ") and, in a circumstance where an Acquisition Proposal has
been made may also take action pursuant to _Section 8.3(a)_; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that the Company shall not effect a Change of Recommendation in
connection with a Superior Proposal or take any action pursuant to _Section
8.3(a)_ with respect to a Superior Proposal unless: (x) the Company notifies
Parent in writing, at least one hundred twenty (120) hours in advance, that it
intends to effect a Change of Recommendation in connection with a Superior
Proposal or to take action pursuant to _Section 8.3(a)_ with respect to a
Superior Proposal, which notice shall specify the identity of the party who
made such Superior Proposal and all of the material terms and conditions of
such Superior Proposal and attach the most current version of such agreement;
(y) after providing such notice and prior to making such Change of
Recommendation in connection with a Superior Proposal or taking any action
pursuant to _Section 8.3(a)_ with respect to a Superior Proposal, the Company
shall negotiate in good faith with Parent during such one hundred twenty (120)
hour period (to the extent that Parent desires to negotiate) to make such
revisions to the terms of this Agreement as would permit the board of
directors of the Company not to effect a Change of Recommendation in
connection with a Superior Proposal or to take such action pursuant to
_Section 8.3(a)_ in response to a Superior Proposal; and (z) the board of
directors of the Company shall have considered in good faith any changes to
this Agreement offered in writing by Parent in a manner that would form a
binding contract if accepted by the Company and shall have determined in good
faith that the Superior Proposal would continue to constitute a Superior
Proposal if such changes offered in writing by Parent were to be given effect;
_provided that_ , for the avoidance of doubt, the Company shall not effect a
Change of Recommendation in connection with a Superior Proposal or take any
action pursuant to _Section 8.3(a)_ with respect to a Superior Proposal prior
to the time that is one hundred twenty (120) hours after it has provided the
written notice required by clause (x) above; _provided_ , _further_ , that in
the event that the Acquisition Proposal is thereafter modified by the party
making such Acquisition Proposal, the Company shall provide written notice of
such modified Acquisition Proposal and shall again comply with this _Section
6.2(c)_, except that the deadline for such new written notice shall be reduced
to seventy two (72) hours (rather than the one hundred twenty (120) hours
otherwise contemplated by this _Section 6.2(c)_) and the time the Company
shall be permitted to effect a Change of Recommendation in connection with a
Superior Proposal or to take action pursuant to _Section 8.3(a)_ with respect
to a Superior Proposal shall be reduced to the time that is seventy two (72)
hours after it has provided such written notice (rather than the time that is
one hundred twenty (120) hours otherwise contemplated by this _Section
6.2(c)_).

 



      
 

 



 

(d) _Certain Permitted Disclosure_. Nothing contained in this _Section 6.2_
shall be deemed to prohibit the Company or the board of directors of the

or state Law with regard to an Acquisition Proposal, including taking and
disclosing to its stockholders a position contemplated by Rule 14d-9 or Rule
14e-2(a) under the Exchange Act (or any similar communication to
stockholders), _provided_ that any disclosure made pursuant to this _Section
6.2(d)(i)_ that constitutes a Change of Recommendation shall result in all of
the consequences of a Change of Recommendation as set forth in this Agreement,
or (ii) making any "stop-look-and-listen" communication to the stockholders of
the Company pursuant to Rule 14d-9(f) under the Exchange Act (or any similar
communications to the stockholders of the Company); _provided_ , _that_ , the
board of directors of Company or any committee thereof shall not effect a
Change of Recommendation except in accordance with _Section 6.2(c)_.

 



 

(e) _Existing Discussions_. The Company agrees that it will, and it will cause
its Representatives to, immediately cease and cause to be terminated any
existing activities, discussions or negotiations with any parties conducted
heretofore with respect to any Acquisition Proposal. The Company shall
promptly (and in any event within two (2) days following the date of this
Agreement) request any Person that has executed a confidentiality or non-
disclosure agreement in connection with any actual or potential Acquisition
Proposal that remains in effect as of the date of this Agreement to return or
destroy all confidential information in the possession of such Person and the
Company shall terminate access to any virtual data room maintained by the
Company for any such Person. The Company agrees that it will take the
necessary steps to promptly inform the individuals or entities referred to in
the first sentence hereof of the obligations undertaken in this _Section

initiated or continued with, it or any of its Representatives indicating, in
connection with such notice, the material terms and conditions of any proposal
or offer (including, if applicable, copies of any written requests, proposals
or offers, including proposed agreements) and thereafter shall keep Parent
reasonably informed, on a prompt basis, of the status and material terms of
any such proposal or offer (including any amendments thereto) and the status
of any such discussions or negotiations. The Company agrees that it will not
enter into any agreement with any Person subsequent to the date of this
Agreement that prohibits the Company from providing any information to Parent
in accordance with this _Section 6.2(f)_.

(a) _Stockholders Meeting_. The Company shall schedule a special meeting of
the holders of Shares to consent and vote upon the adoption of this Agreement

Recommendation has been effected, that Parent, Merger Sub and their counsel
shall be given a reasonable opportunity to review the Proxy Statement before
it is filed with the SEC and the Company shall give due consideration to all
reasonable additions, deletions, or changes thereto suggested by Parent,

Statement and draft correspondence and due consideration has been given to
such comments by the Company, copies of all correspondence between the Company
and/or any of its Representatives and the SEC. The Company and Parent shall
each use reasonable best efforts to promptly provide satisfactory responses to
the SEC with respect to all comments received on the Proxy Statement by the
SEC, and the Company shall cause the definitive Proxy Statement to be mailed

Statement in connection with a Change of Recommendation without the prior
consent of Parent.

authorize and duly adopt, execute and deliver, and will ensure that a duly
qualified Rights Agent executes and delivers, the CVR Agreement, subject to
any reasonable revisions to the CVR Agreement that are requested by such

individually or in the aggregate, detrimental or adverse, taken as a whole, to
any holder of CVR). Parent Holdco, Parent and the Company shall cooperate,
including by making changes to the form of CVR Agreement, as necessary to

(i) Subject to the terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement, the
Company, Parent Holdco and Parent shall cooperate with each other and use (and
shall cause their respective Subsidiaries to use) their respective reasonable
best efforts to take or cause to be taken all actions, and do or cause to be
done all things, reasonably necessary, proper or advisable on its part under
this Agreement and applicable Laws to consummate and make effective the Merger
as soon as practicable, including preparing and filing as promptly as
practicable (and in any event shall make all filings pursuant to the HSR Act
within fifteen (15) days of the date hereof) all documentation to effect all
necessary notices, reports and other filings and to obtain as promptly as
practicable all consents, registrations, approvals, permits and authorizations
necessary or advisable to be obtained from any third party and/or any
Governmental Entity in order to consummate the Merger. Parent may withdraw and
refile its initial filing if in its reasonable judgment such step is
consistent with expeditiously obtaining a required clearance. The Company and
Parent will each request early termination of the waiting period with respect
to the Merger under the HSR Act. Subject to applicable Laws relating to the
exchange of information, Parent and the Company shall have the right to review
in advance and, to the extent practicable, each will consult with the other on
and consider in good faith the views of the other in connection with, all of
the information relating to Parent Holdco and Parent or the Company, as the
case may be, including the tax, regulatory and commercial considerations of
each party, and any of their respective Subsidiaries, that appears in any
filing made with, or written materials submitted to, any third party and/or
any Governmental Entity in connection with the Merger. Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, nothing contained herein
shall be interpreted to require either party to exchange its HSR Act filing,
including attachments, with the other party, except on an outside counsel only
basis. In exercising the foregoing rights, each of the Company, Parent Holdco
and Parent shall act reasonably and as promptly as practicable. Nothing in
this Agreement shall require the Company or its Subsidiaries to take or agree
to take any action with respect to its business or operations unless the
effectiveness of such agreement or action is conditioned upon Closing.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, but subject to compliance with the remainder of
this _Section 6.3_, including Parents right to withdraw and refile its
initial filing, Parent shall, following consultation with the Company and
after giving due consideration to its views and its obligation to use its
reasonable best efforts to consummate the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement as expeditiously as possible, direct and control all aspects of the
parties efforts to gain regulatory clearance either before any Governmental
Entity or in any action brought to enjoin the Merger and the other
transactions contemplated hereby pursuant to any antitrust or competition Law
including any divestiture activities.

 



 

(ii) The Company, on the one hand, and Parent and its Subsidiaries, on the
other hand, shall use commercially reasonable efforts to cooperate with each
other in

 



      
 

 



 

connection with (A) reasonably optimizing the Tax consequences resulting from
the transactions that may be required by _Section 6.3(g)_ and (B) Parents
integration planning (including by providing reasonable assistance in
obtaining records and information and using commercially reasonable efforts to
make available relevant third party advisors).

 



 

(e) _Information_. Subject to applicable Laws, the Company and Parent each
shall, upon request by the other, furnish the other with all information
concerning itself, its Subsidiaries, directors, officers and stockholders and
such other matters as may be reasonably necessary or advisable in connection
with the Proxy Statement and any other statement, filing, notice or
application made by or on behalf of Parent, the Company or any of their
respective Subsidiaries to any third party and/or any Governmental Entity in
connection with the Merger. If Parent Holdco or Parent elects to file a
registration statement and/or arrange financing, in accordance with the
Securities Laws prior to the Closing Date, the Company will use its
commercially reasonable efforts, at Parents request, (i) to permit the use of
the Companys financial statements in such registration statement and / or
financing, (ii) to assist Parent with the preparation of _pro forma_ financial
statements by Parent, (iii) to cause its current or former independent
accountants to (A) provide any necessary written consents to use their audit
reports relating to the Company and to be named as an "Expert" in any document
related to any registration statement, and (B) provide any customary "comfort
letters" (including customary negative assurance comfort, including change
period comfort) and (iv) provide such other information (financial or
otherwise) that is reasonably requested by Parent in connection with any of
(i) through (iv), _provided_ that neither the Company nor any of its
Subsidiaries shall be required to pay any fees, incur or reimburse any cost or
expense, or make any payment or otherwise incur any liability relating to any
such registration statement and / or financing to the extent the Parent does
not have a reimbursement or indemnity obligation to the Company or its
Subsidiaries pursuant this _Section 6.3(e)_. Parent shall promptly, upon the
written request of the Company (i) reimburse the Company for all reasonable
out-of-pocket costs (including reasonable accountants fees) incurred by the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries in connection with providing assistance
requested by the Parent, pursuant to this _Section 6.3(e)_ and (ii) indemnify
the Company and its Subsidiaries for any damages, losses, costs, liabilities
or expenses suffered or incurred by any of them in connection with taking
actions requested by the Parent, pursuant to, and otherwise in connection with
this _Section 6.3(e)_. Parent and the Merger Sub acknowledge and agree that
the Closing shall not be conditioned upon any financing requirement of Parent
or the Merger Sub.

 



 

(f) _Status_. Subject to applicable Laws and the instructions of any
Governmental Entity, the Company, on the one hand, and Parent Holdco and
Parent, on the other hand, each shall keep the other apprised of the status of
matters relating to completion of the Merger, including promptly furnishing
the other with copies of notices or other communications received by Parent
Holdco, Parent or the Company, as the case may be, or any of its Subsidiaries,
from any third party and/or any Governmental Entity with respect to the
Merger. Neither the Company nor Parent Holdco and Parent shall permit any of
its officers or any other Representatives to participate in any meeting or
substantive telephone discussion with any Governmental Entity in respect of
any filings, investigation or other inquiry with respect to the Merger unless
to the extent practicable: (i) it consults with the other party in advance and
(ii) to the extent permitted by such Governmental Entity, gives the other
party the opportunity to attend and participate in such meeting or substantive
telephone discussion.

 



      
 

 



 

(g) _Regulatory Matters_. Without limiting the generality of the other
undertakings pursuant to this _Section 6.3_, each of the Company (in the case
of _Sections 6.3(g)(i)_, _6.3(g)(iii)_ and _6.3(g)(iv)_ ) and Parent Holdco
(in all cases set forth below) agrees to take or cause to be taken the
following actions, in each case subject to clause (iv) below:

 



 

(i) the prompt provision to each and every federal, state, local or foreign
court or Governmental Entity with jurisdiction over enforcement of any
applicable antitrust or competition Laws (" _Government Antitrust Entity_ ")
of non-privileged information and documents requested by any Government
Antitrust Entity or that are necessary, proper or advisable to permit
consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement;

 



 

(ii) Parent Holdco agrees to, and will cause each of its Subsidiaries and
Affiliates to, use its reasonable best efforts to avoid the entry of any
permanent, preliminary or temporary injunction or other order, decree,
decision, determination or judgment that would delay, restrain, prevent,
enjoin or otherwise prohibit consummation of the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement, which reasonable best efforts shall be deemed to include,
without limitation, the defense through litigation on the merits of any claim
asserted in any court, agency or other proceeding by any Person, including,
without limitation, any Governmental Entity, seeking to delay, restrain,
prevent, enjoin or otherwise prohibit consummation of such transactions and,
subject to _Section 6.3(g)(iv)_, the proffer and agreement by Parent Holdco
of its willingness to sell, lease, license or otherwise dispose of, or hold
separate pending such disposition, and promptly to effect the sale, lease,
license, disposal and holding separate of, such assets, rights, product lines,
licenses, categories of assets or businesses or other operations, or interests
therein, of the Company, Parent Holdco or any of their respective Subsidiaries
(and the entry into agreements with, and submission to orders of, the relevant
Government Antitrust Entity giving effect thereto) if such action should be
reasonably necessary or advisable to avoid, prevent, eliminate or remove the
actual, anticipated or threatened (x) commencement of any proceeding in any
forum or (y) issuance of any order, decree, decision, determination, judgment
or Law that would delay, restrain, prevent, enjoin or otherwise prohibit
consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement by any
Government Antitrust Entity ( _it being understood_ that, as it relates to the
Company and its Subsidiaries, no such action will be binding on the Company or
its Subsidiaries without the Companys prior written consent unless it is
contingent upon the occurrence of the Closing);

 



 

(iii) to take, in the event that any permanent, preliminary or temporary
injunction, decision, order, judgment, determination, decree or Law is
entered, issued or enacted, or becomes reasonably foreseeable to be entered,
issued or enacted, in any proceeding, review or inquiry of any kind, that
would make consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement in
accordance with the terms of this Agreement unlawful or that would delay
beyond the Outside Date (as defined below), restrain, prevent, enjoin or
otherwise prohibit consummation of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, any and all steps (including, without limitation, the appeal
thereof, the posting of a bond or the taking of the steps contemplated by
clause (ii) of this paragraph (g)) necessary to resist, vacate, modify,
reverse, suspend, prevent,

 



      
 

 



 

eliminate, avoid or remove such actual, anticipated or threatened injunction,
decision, order, judgment, determination, decree or enactment so as to permit
such consummation on a schedule as close as possible to that contemplated by
this Agreement; and

 



 

(iv) notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement,
including but not limited to _Sections 6.3(g)(i)-(iii)_, Parent Holdco shall
not be required to sell, lease, license or otherwise dispose of, or hold
separate pending such disposition of, any assets, rights, product lines,
licenses, categories of assets or businesses or other operations, or interests
therein, of the Company, Parent Holdco or any of their respective
Subsidiaries, except any currently (as of the date of execution of this
Agreement) marketed products of the Company that collectively generated gross
revenues of no greater than $77,000,000 in the 2014 fiscal year; _provided_
that, in connection with any divestiture required pursuant to this _Section
6.3(g)(iv))_ or that Parent Holdco elects to pursue in connection with the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, the Company will provide all
cooperation reasonably requested to assist Parent Holdco in fulfilling Parent
Holdcos obligations at Parent Holdcos sole cost and expense, including (a)
making available its management team for meetings with prospective acquirers
regarding the assets proposed to be divested, (b) assisting Parent Holdco in
its preparation of marketing materials and (c) otherwise assisting Parent
Holdco in facilitating the transaction, in each case where any such
transaction would be contingent upon the occurrence of the Effective Time.

 



 

(h) _Obligation of Merger Sub_. Parent Holdco and Parent shall take all action
necessary to cause Merger Sub to perform its obligations under this Agreement
and to consummate the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by the
Agreement on the terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement. Immediately
following the date of this Agreement, Parent shall provide or make available
to the Company a copy of Parents approval of this Agreement, as the sole
stockholder of Merger Sub.

 



 

6.4 _Access and Reports_. Subject to applicable Law, upon reasonable notice,
the Company shall (and shall cause its Subsidiaries to) afford Parents
officers and other authorized Representatives reasonable access, during normal
business hours throughout the period prior to the Effective Time, to its
employees, properties, books, contracts and records and, during such period,
the Company shall (and shall cause its Subsidiaries to) furnish promptly to
Parent all information concerning its business, properties and personnel as
may reasonably be requested, _provided_ that no investigation pursuant to this
_Section 6.4_ shall affect or be deemed to modify any representation or
warranty made by the Company herein, and _provided_ , _further_ , that the
foregoing shall not require the Company or any of its Subsidiaries (i) to
permit any inspection, or to disclose any information, that in the reasonable
judgment of the Company would (A) result in the disclosure of any trade
secrets of third parties or violate any of its obligations with respect to
confidentiality or to disclose privileged information; _provided_ that the
Company will use its reasonable best efforts to develop alternative processes
to permit such disclosure, including without limitation, common interest
agreements, outside counsel review, and requesting necessary consents from
third parties, (B) be reasonably likely to result in a violation of any Law or
(C) if the Company or any of its Affiliates, on the one hand, and Parent or
any of its Affiliates, on the other hand, are adverse parties in a litigation
or other proceeding, to disclose or permit access to any information that is
reasonably pertinent to such litigation or

 



      
 

 



 

other proceeding. All requests for information made pursuant to this _Section
6.4_ shall be directed to the Companys executive officers or other Person
designated by the Company. All such information shall be governed by the terms
of the Confidentiality Agreement.

 



 

6.5 _Stock Exchange De-listing_. Prior to the Closing Date, the Company shall
cooperate with Parent and use reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be
taken, all actions, and do or cause to be done all things, reasonably
necessary, proper or advisable on its part under applicable Laws and rules and
policies of NASDAQ to enable the de-listing by the Surviving Corporation of
the Shares from NASDAQ and the deregistration of the Shares under the Exchange
Act as promptly as practicable after the Effective Time. If the Surviving
Corporation is reasonably likely to be required to file any quarterly or
annual periodic reports pursuant to the Exchange Act during the fifteen (15)
days after the Closing Date, the Company will deliver to Parent at least five
(5) Business Days prior to the Closing a substantially final draft of any such
quarterly or annual periodic reports reasonably likely to be filed during such
period and fully executed officer certifications required to be filed with
such quarterly or annual periodic reports.

 



 

6.6 _Publicity_. The initial press release regarding the Merger shall be a
joint press release and thereafter, so long as this Agreement is in effect
(unless and until a Change of Recommendation has occurred or in connection
with _Section 6.2(c)_), the Company and Parent each shall consult with the
other prior to issuing any press releases or otherwise making public
announcements with respect to the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement and prior to making any filings with any third
party and/or any Governmental Entity (including any national securities
exchange or interdealer quotation service) with respect thereto, except as may
be required by Law or by obligations pursuant to any listing agreement with or
rules of any national securities exchange or interdealer quotation service or
by any listing authority (including the U.K. Listing Authority) or by the
request of any Governmental Entity.

 



 

6.7 _Employee Benefits_.

 



 

(a) Parent shall provide, or shall cause to be provided to each employee of
the Company and its Subsidiaries who is employed as of immediately prior to
the Effective Time and continues to be employed by the Surviving Corporation
or any Affiliate (each, a " _Continuing Employee_ ") the wages, incentive
bonus opportunities and benefits set forth on _Schedule 6.7(a)_.

 



 

(b) For purposes of vesting, benefit accruals (but not for benefit accrual
purposes under any defined benefit pension plan), vacation and sick time
credit and eligibility to participate under the employee benefit plans,
programs and policies of Parent and its Subsidiaries providing benefits to any
Continuing Employee after the Effective Time (including the Benefit Plans)
(the " _New Plans_ "), each Continuing Employee shall be credited with his or
her years of service with the Company and its Subsidiaries and their
respective predecessors (to the extent credited by the Company and its
Subsidiaries) before the Effective Time, to the same extent as such Continuing
Employee was entitled, before the Effective Time, to credit for such service
under any similar Benefit Plan in which such Continuing Employee participated
or was eligible to participate immediately prior to the Effective Time;
_provided_ that the foregoing shall not apply to the extent that its
application would result in a duplication of benefits with respect to the same
period of service. In addition, and without limiting the generality of the
foregoing, Parent shall use commercially reasonable efforts to cause, to the
extent consistent with Parents current

 



      
 

 



 

employee benefit plans, programs and policies (i) each Continuing Employee to
be immediately eligible to participate, without any waiting time, in any and
all New Plans to the extent coverage under such New Plan is replacing
comparable coverage under a Benefit Plan in which such Continuing Employee
participated immediately before the Effective Time (such plans, collectively,
the " _Old Plans_ "), and (ii) for purposes of each New Plan providing
medical, dental, pharmaceutical and/or vision benefits to any Continuing
Employee, any evidence of insurability requirements, all pre-existing
condition exclusions and actively-at-work requirements of such New Plan to be
waived for such Continuing Employee and his or her covered dependents, to the
extent such conditions were inapplicable or waived under the comparable Old
Plan. Parent shall use commercially reasonable efforts, to the extent
consistent with Parents current employee benefit plans, programs and
policies, to cause any eligible expenses incurred by any Continuing Employee
and his or her covered dependents during the portion of the plan year of the
Old Plan ending on the date such Continuing Employees participation in the
corresponding New Plan begins to be taken into account under such New Plan for
purposes of satisfying all deductible, coinsurance and maximum out-of-pocket
requirements applicable to such Continuing Employee and his or her covered
dependents for the applicable plan year.

 



 

(c) Parent hereby acknowledges that a "change in control" or other event with
similar import, within the meaning of the Benefit Plans that contain such
terms, will occur upon the Effective Time. Parent shall, and shall cause the
Surviving Corporation and any successor thereto to, in accordance with Section
6.7(c) of the Company Disclosure Letter, honor, assume, fulfill and discharge
the Companys and its Subsidiaries obligations under the Benefit Plans.

 



 

(d) If the Effective Time occurs prior to the time when bonuses are paid with
respect to calendar year 2015, at the Effective Time the Company shall pay
each participant in the Companys incentive plans (the " _Incentive Plans_ ")
who remains employed through the Effective Time an annual incentive amount in
respect of the 2015 fiscal year, equal to the actual level of performance
achieved as of the earlier to occur of December 31, 2015 and the Effective
Time (with such performance measure prorated, if applicable, for the portion
of the performance cycle completed at the Effective Time), as determined by
the compensation committee of the board of directors of the Company prior to
the Effective Time in accordance with the terms of the applicable Incentive
Plans and based on performance through the earlier to occur of December 31,
2015 and the day that is no more than five (5) business days prior to the
Effective Time; _provided_ that, with respect to any employee who is a party
to an Executive Retention Agreement, if the Effective Time occurs in 2015 and
such employee is terminated without "Cause" or "Good Reason" (as such terms
are defined in his or her Executive Retention Agreement) following the
Effective Time but prior to January 1, 2016, such employee will not be
entitled to receive a prorated bonus with respect to calendar year 2015
pursuant to the Executive Retention Agreement. In no event shall the aggregate
amount of all such bonuses be more than the amount that would be paid if the
level of performance achieved was equal to 150% of each employees target.

 



 

(e) Unless otherwise requested by Parent at least five (5) days prior to the
Closing Date, the Company shall take (or cause to be taken) all actions
necessary or appropriate to terminate, effective no later than the day prior
to the Closing Date, the Company 401(k) Profit Sharing Plan (the " _Company
401(k) Plan_"). The Company shall provide to Parent prior to the Closing Date
written evidence of the adoption by the Companys board of directors (or other

 



      
 

 



 

authorized committee) of resolutions terminating such Company 401(k) Plan (the
form and substance of which resolutions shall be subject to the prior review
and approval of Parent, which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld or
delayed). No later than the Effective Time, (i) the Company shall take all
actions reasonably necessary to cause each Continuing Employee to become 100%
vested in such Continuing Employees accounts under such Company 401(k) Plan,
effective as of the Closing Date or, if earlier, the date on which such
Company 401(k) Plan is terminated and (ii) Parent shall take all actions
reasonably necessary to permit each Continuing Employee to make rollover
contributions of "eligible rollover distributions" (within the meaning of
Section 401(a)(31) of the Code) in an amount equal to the full account balance
distributed or distributable to such Continuing Employee from the Company
401(k) Plan to a tax-qualified defined contribution retirement plan maintained
by Parent or one of its Subsidiaries (the " _Parent 401(k) Plan_") and to
transfer outstanding loans to the Parent 401(k) Plan. Each Continuing Employee
shall be eligible to become a participant in the Parent 401(k) Plan as soon as
administratively practical after the Closing Date.

 



 

(f) The provisions of this _Section 6.7_ are solely for the benefit of the
parties to this Agreement, and nothing in this Agreement, whether express or
implied, is intended to, or shall, (i) constitute the establishment or
adoption of or an amendment to any employee benefit plan for purposes of ERISA
or otherwise be treated as an amendment or modification of any Benefit Plan,
New Plan or other benefit plan, agreement or arrangement (other than _Section
6.7(e)_), (ii) limit the right of Parent, the Company or their respective
Subsidiaries to amend, terminate or otherwise modify any Benefit Plan, New
Plan or other benefit plan, agreement or arrangement following the Effective
Time, or (iii) create any third-party beneficiary or other right (including,
but not limited to, a right to employment) in any Person, including any
current or former employee of the Company or any Subsidiary of the Company, or
any participant in any Benefit Plan, New Plan or other benefit plan, agreement
or arrangement (or any dependent or beneficiary thereof).

 



 

(g) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement or the
Confidentiality Agreement, from and after the date hereof until the Effective
Time, the Company shall permit Parent to meet with key employees and executive
officers to discuss employment arrangements to be entered into between Parent,
one of its Affiliates or the Surviving Corporation, and such key employees and
executive officers following the Effective Time.

 



 

(h) Not later than five (5) business days prior to the anticipated Effective
Time, the Company will update Section 5.1(b) of the Company Disclosure Letter
to reflect then current information regarding the Company Options and Company
RSUs, and provide such updated schedule to Parent.

 



 

6.8 _Agreements Concerning Parent Holdco, Parent and Merger Sub_. During the
period from the date of this Agreement through the Effective Time, Merger Sub
shall not engage in any activity of any nature except for activities related
to or in furtherance of the Merger. Other than with respect to a potential
transaction involving Baxalta, Parent Holdco agrees that it shall not, and
shall not permit any of its Affiliates to, directly or indirectly, acquire or
agree to acquire any assets, business or any Person, whether by merger,
consolidation, purchasing the assets of or equity in any Person or by any
other manner if the entering into of an agreement relating to or the
consummation of such acquisition, merger, consolidation or

 



      
 

 



 

purchase or other transaction or action would reasonably be expected to
materially increase the risk of any Governmental Entity entering, or
materially increase the risk of not being able to remove or successfully
challenge, any permanent, preliminary or temporary injunction or other order,
decree, decision, determination or judgment that would delay, restrain,
prevent, enjoin or otherwise prohibit consummation of the Merger and the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement prior to the Outside Date.

 



 

6.9 _Indemnification; Directors  and Officers Insurance_.

 



 

(a) From and after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall, and
Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, indemnify and hold harmless,
to the fullest extent provided for under the Company Charter and Company
bylaws as in effect on the date hereof (and the Surviving Corporation shall
also advance expenses as incurred to the fullest extent provided for under the
Company Charter and Company bylaws as in effect on the date hereof; _provided_
that the Person to whom expenses are advanced provides an undertaking to repay
such advances if it is finally determined by a court of competent jurisdiction
that such Person is not entitled to indemnification), each Person who was
entitled to such indemnification and advancement from the Company and its
Subsidiaries (in each case, when acting in such capacity) immediately prior to
the date hereof (collectively, the " _Indemnified Parties_ ") against any
costs or expenses (including reasonable attorneys fees), judgments, fines,
losses, claims, damages or liabilities incurred in connection with any claim,
action, suit, proceeding or investigation, whether civil, criminal,
administrative or investigative, arising out of or related to such Indemnified
Parties service as a director, officer or employee of the Company or its
Subsidiaries or services performed by such Persons at the request of the
Company or its Subsidiaries at or prior to the Effective Time, whether
asserted or claimed prior to, at or after the Effective Time, including (i)
the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement and (ii)
actions to enforce this _Section 6.9_ or any other indemnification or
advancement right of any Indemnified Party.

 



 

(b) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall, and if the Company is
unable to, Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation as of the Effective
Time to, obtain and fully pay the premium for the extension of (i) the
directors and officers liability coverage of the Companys existing
directors and officers insurance policies, and (ii) the Companys existing
fiduciary liability insurance policies, in each case for a claims reporting or
discovery period of at least six (6) years from and after the Effective Time
from an insurance carrier with the same or better credit rating as the
Companys current insurance carrier with respect to directors and officers
liability insurance and fiduciary liability insurance (collectively, " _D andO
Insurance_") with terms, conditions, retentions and limits of liability that
are at least as favorable as the Companys existing policies with respect to
any actual or alleged error, misstatement, misleading statement, act,
omission, neglect, breach of duty or any matter claimed against a director or
officer of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries by reason of him or her
serving in such capacity that existed or occurred at or prior to the Effective
Time (including in connection with this Agreement or the transactions or
actions contemplated hereby). If the Company and the Surviving Corporation for
any reason fail to obtain such "tail" insurance policies as of the Effective
Time, the Surviving Corporation shall, and Parent shall cause the Surviving
Corporation to, continue to maintain in effect for a period of at least six
(6) years from and after the Effective Time the DandO Insurance in place as of
the date hereof with terms, conditions,

 



      
 

 



 

retentions and limits of liability that are at least as favorable as provided
in the Companys existing policies as of the date hereof, or the Surviving
Corporation shall, and Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, use
reasonable best efforts to purchase comparable DandO Insurance for such six-year
period with terms, conditions, retentions and limits of liability that are at
least as favorable as provided in the Companys existing policies as of the
date hereof; _provided_ , _however_ , that in no event shall Parent or the
Surviving Corporation be required to expend for such policies pursuant to this
sentence an annual premium amount in excess of 300% of the annual premiums
currently paid by the Company for such insurance; and _provided_ , _further_ ,
that if the annual premiums of such insurance coverage exceed such amount, the
Surviving Corporation shall obtain a policy with the greatest coverage
available for a cost not exceeding such amount.

 



 

(c) If Parent Holdco, Parent or the Surviving Corporation or any of their
respective successors or assigns shall (i) consolidate with or merge into any
other corporation or entity and shall not be the continuing or surviving
corporation or entity of such consolidation or merger or (ii) transfer all or
substantially all of its properties and assets to any individual, corporation
or other entity, then, and in each such case, proper provisions shall be made
so that the successors and assigns of Parent Holdco, Parent or the Surviving
Corporation shall assume all of the obligations set forth in this _Section
6.9_.

 



 

(d) The provisions of this _Section 6.9_ are intended to be for the benefit
of, and shall be enforceable by, each of the Indemnified Parties.

 



 

(e) The rights of the Indemnified Parties under this _Section 6.9_ shall be
in addition to any rights such Indemnified Parties may have under the
certificate of incorporation, certificate of formation or bylaws of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries, or under any applicable Contracts or Laws.
All rights to indemnification and exculpation from liabilities for acts or
omissions occurring at or prior to the Effective Time and rights to
advancement of expenses relating thereto now existing in favor of any
Indemnified Party as provided in the certificate of incorporation, certificate
of formation or bylaws of the Company or of any Subsidiary of the Company or
any indemnification agreement between such Indemnified Party and the Company
or any of its Subsidiaries shall survive the Merger or any other transaction
contemplated by this Agreement and shall not be amended, repealed or otherwise
modified in any manner that would adversely affect any right thereunder of any
such Indemnified Party.

 



 

6.10 _Takeover Statutes_. If any Takeover Statute is or may become applicable
to the Merger or any other transaction contemplated by this Agreement, the
Company and its board of directors shall grant such approvals and take such
actions as are necessary so that such transactions may be consummated as
promptly as practicable on the terms contemplated by this Agreement and
otherwise act to eliminate or minimize the effects of such statute or
regulation on such transactions.

 



 

6.11 _Section 16 Matters_. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company will take
all actions reasonably necessary to cause the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement and any other dispositions of equity securities of the Company
(including derivative securities) in connection with the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement by each individual who is

 



      
 

 



 

subject to the reporting requirements of Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act to
be exempt under Rule 16b-3 under the Exchange Act.

 



 

6.12 _Parent Holdco Guarantee_. Parent Holdco irrevocably and unconditionally
guarantees to the Company the due and punctual performance of the obligations
of Parent and Merger Sub hereunder (the " _Guaranteed Obligations_ ") subject
to the terms hereof. If, for any reason whatsoever, Parent or Merger Sub
shall fail or be unable to duly, punctually and fully pay or perform the
Guaranteed Obligations, Parent Holdco will forthwith pay or perform, or cause
to be paid or performed, the Guaranteed Obligations. This is a guarantee of
payment and performance and not merely of collectability.

 



 

6.13 _Transaction Litigation_. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall
promptly notify Parent of all civil, criminal or administrative actions,
suits, claims, hearings, arbitrations, investigations or other proceedings
commenced or threatened against the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or the
board of directors of the Company, or any committee thereof, in each case in
connection with, arising from or otherwise relating to the Merger or any other
transaction contemplated by this Agreement (" _Transaction Litigation_ ")
(including by providing copies of all pleadings with respect thereto) and
thereafter keep Parent reasonably informed with respect to the status thereof.
The Company shall (i) give Parent the opportunity to participate in the
defense, settlement or prosecution of any Transaction Litigation and (ii)
consult with Parent with respect to the defense, settlement and prosecution of
any Transaction Litigation. The Company shall not agree to any settlement
related to any Transaction Litigation without Parents consent, such consent
not to be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned. For purposes of this
_Section 6.13_, "participate" means that Parent will be kept reasonably
apprised of proposed strategy and other significant decisions with respect to
the Transaction Litigation by the Company (to the extent that the attorney-
client privilege between the Company and its counsel is not undermined or
otherwise affected), and Parent may offer comments or suggestions with respect
to such Transaction Litigation which the Company shall consider in good faith,
but Parent will not be afforded any decision-making power or other authority
over such Transaction Litigation.

 



 

6.14 _Resignations_. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall cause
each director of the Company or its Subsidiaries to execute and deliver a
letter effectuating his or her resignation as a director of such entity
effective as of the Effective Time; _provided_ that, notwithstanding anything
else to the contrary, such resignation will not result in the forfeiture of
any Company RSUs or Company Options held by such individual and that all
Company RSUs and Company Options held by such individual immediately prior to
the Effective Time (whether vested or unvested) will be treated in accordance
with _Sections 4.3(a)_ and _4.3(b)_. The Company will cooperate with Parent
to effect the replacement of any such directors selected by Parent at the
Effective Time.

5.1(f)_ ( _Absence of Certain Changes_ ) and in _Section 5.1(m)_ ( _Takeover
Statutes_ ) shall have been true and correct in all respects as of the date of
this Agreement and shall be true and correct in all respects as of the Closing
Date (other than those representations and warranties that speak only as to a
particular date or time, which shall have been true and correct as of such
date and time);

 



 

(b) (i) the Company shall have performed and complied with, in all material
respects, its obligations, agreements and covenants under this Agreement
required to be performed at or prior to the Closing Date and (ii) since the

Subsidiaries, taken as a whole;

 



 

(c) the Company shall have delivered to Parent a certificate signed by its
Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, dated the Closing Date,

material limitations on the ownership or operation of all or a portion of the
operations or assets of Company and its Subsidiaries (or Parents direct
equity ownership of the Surviving Corporation or indirect equity ownership,
following the Effective Time, of the Companys Subsidiaries).

satisfaction or waiver in writing (where permissible) of each of the following
conditions:

and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement;

ARTICLE VIII

 



 

 _Termination_

 



 

8.1 _Termination by Mutual Consent_. This Agreement may be terminated and the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement may be abandoned at any time prior
to the Effective Time, whether before or after the adoption of this Agreement
by the Companys stockholders, by mutual written consent of the Company and
Parent by action of their respective boards of directors.

 



 

8.2 _Termination by Either Parent or the Company_. This Agreement may be
terminated and the transactions contemplated by this Agreement may be
abandoned at any time prior to the Effective Time by action of the board of
directors of either Parent or the Company, and upon delivery of written notice
to the other party if:

 



 

(a) the Closing shall not have occurred by August 2, 2016 (as it may be
extended as described below in this _Section 8.2(a)_, the " _Termination
Date_ "); _provided_ , _however_ , that if as of such date, the condition set
forth in Section 7.1(c) is not satisfied but all of the other conditions set
forth in ARTICLE VII shall have been satisfied or waived or shall be capable
of being satisfied or waived as of such date if the Closing were otherwise to
occur on such date and the condition set forth in _Section 7.1(c)_ remain
capable of being satisfied or waived, then the Termination Date may be
extended from August 2, 2016 to November 2, 2016 (the " _Outside Date_ ") at
the election of Parent or the Company by written notice to the other party
(and the Outside Date shall then be the Termination Date), _provided_ ,
_further_ , that the right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this
_Section 8.2(a)_ shall not be available to any party hereto that has breached
its obligations under this Agreement in any manner that shall have contributed
to the failure of the Closing to have occurred prior to the Termination Date
in any material respect;

 



 

(b) any Order permanently restraining, enjoining or otherwise prohibiting
consummation of the Merger shall become final and non-appealable; _provided_
that the right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this _Section 8.2(b)_
shall not be available to any party that has breached in its obligations under
this Agreement in any manner that shall have proximately contributed to the
existence of such Order in any material respect; or

 



      
 

 



 

(c) this Agreement shall not have been duly adopted by stockholders of the
Company constituting the Company Requisite Vote at the Stockholders Meeting or
any adjournment or postponement thereof.

 



 

8.3 _Termination by the Company_. This Agreement may be terminated and the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement may be abandoned by the Company
upon delivery of written notice to Parent:

 



 

(a) at any time prior to the time the Company Requisite Vote is obtained, if
(i) the board of directors of the Company authorizes the Company, subject to
complying with the terms of _Section 6.2(c)_ in all material respects, to
enter into an Alternative Acquisition Agreement with respect to a Superior
Proposal; (ii) immediately prior to or substantially concurrently with the
termination of this Agreement the Company enters into an Alternative
Acquisition Agreement with respect to a Superior Proposal; and (iii) the
Company satisfies its obligations to pay the Termination Fee under _Section
8.5(b)_; or

 



 

(b) at any time prior to the Effective Time, if there has been a breach of any
representation, warranty, covenant or agreement made by Parent Holdco, Parent
or Merger Sub in this Agreement, or any such representation and warranty shall
have become untrue after the date of this Agreement, and such breach or
untruth would give rise to a failure of the condition to Closing set forth in
_Section 7.3(a)_ or _Section 7.3(b)_ to be satisfied and such breach or
untruth is not curable or, if curable, is not cured prior to the earlier of
(i) thirty (30) days after written notice thereof is given by the Company to
Parent or (ii) the Termination Date.

 



 

8.4 _Termination by Parent_. This Agreement may be terminated and the Merger
may be abandoned by Parent at any time prior to the Effective Time upon
delivery of written notice to the Company:

 



 

(a) if the board of directors of the Company shall have made and not have
withdrawn a Change of Recommendation; and

 



 

(b) at any time prior to the Effective Time, if there has been a breach of any
representation, warranty, covenant or agreement made by the Company in this
Agreement, or any such representation and warranty shall have become untrue
after the date of this Agreement, and such breach or untruth gives rise to a
failure of the condition to Closing set forth in _Section 7.2(a)_ or _Section
7.2(b)(i)_ hereto to be satisfied and such breach or untruth is not curable
or, if curable, is not cured prior to the earlier of (i) thirty (30) days
after written notice thereof is given by Parent to the Company or (ii) the
Termination Date.

 



 

8.5 _Effect of Termination and Abandonment_.

 



 

(a) Except as provided in paragraphs (b) and (c) below, in the event of
termination of this Agreement and the abandonment of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement pursuant to this _ARTICLE VIII_, this
Agreement shall become void and of no effect with no liability to any Person
on the part of any party hereto (or of any of its Representatives or
Affiliates); _provided_ , _however_ , and notwithstanding anything in the
foregoing to the contrary, that (i) except as otherwise provided herein, no
such termination shall relieve any party hereto of any liability or damages to
the other party hereto resulting from fraud or any breach of this

 



      
 

 



 

Agreement and (ii) the provisions set forth in this _Section 8.5_ and the
second sentence of _Section 9.1_ shall survive the termination of this
Agreement.

 



 

(b) In the event that:

 



 

(i) a _bona fide_ Acquisition Proposal shall have been made to the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries or any Person shall have publicly announced an
intention (whether or not conditional) to make a _bona fide_ Acquisition
Proposal with respect to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries (and such
Acquisition Proposal or publicly announced intention shall not have been
publicly withdrawn prior to the date of termination) and thereafter this
Agreement is terminated by either Parent or the Company pursuant to _Section
8.2(a)_ or _Section 8.2(c)_ or by Parent pursuant to _Section 8.4(b)_;

 



 

(ii) this Agreement is terminated by Parent pursuant to _Section 8.4(a)_; or

 



 

(iii) this Agreement is terminated by the Company pursuant to _Section
8.3(a)_;

 



 

then the Company shall promptly, but in no event later than two (2) business
days after the date of such termination, pay the Termination Fee; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that (A) no Termination Fee shall be payable pursuant to clause
(i) of this paragraph (b) unless and until, within twelve (12) months of such
termination, the Company or any of its Subsidiaries shall have entered into an
Alternative Acquisition Agreement with respect to an Acquisition Proposal and
such Acquisition Proposal is thereafter consummated (substituting "50%" for
"15%" in the definition thereof); (B) such Termination Fee payable to Parent
pursuant to clause (i) of this paragraph (b) shall be promptly payable after
the consummation of such Acquisition Proposal (but in no event later than two
(2) business days of such consummation), and (C) any Termination Fee payable
pursuant to clause (iii) of this paragraph (b) shall be satisfied immediately
prior to or substantially concurrently with, and as a condition of, such
termination; _provided_ that, if the Termination Fee is payable pursuant to
_Section 8.5(b)(i)_, the Termination Fee shall be reduced by any amount of
Reimbursable Expenses (as defined below) the Company has previously paid to
Parent pursuant to _Section 8.5(d)_. The Company shall satisfy its obligation
to pay a Termination Fee by (A) contributing to a newly formed Irish private
limited company, centrally managed and controlled, domiciled and resident in
Ireland, which may elect to be disregarded for U.S. federal income tax
purposes (" _Irish Holdco_ "), immediately available funds and any fees
required to be paid pursuant to this _Section 8.5_ in exchange for one common
share of Irish Holdco and (B) and by selling the Irish Holdco common share to
Parent Holdco in exchange for US $1.00. For the avoidance of doubt, any Irish
stamp duty liability arising in connection with the sale of Irish Holdco will
be payable by Parent Holdco and Parent Holdco agrees to indemnify the Company
against any such liability. As used in this Agreement, " _Termination Fee_ "
means (x) with respect to a payment required to be made by the Company an
amount equal to $180,000,000 and (y) with respect to a payment required to be
made by Parent an amount equal to $280,000,000.

 



 

(c) If (i) Parent or the Company shall have terminated this Agreement pursuant
to _Section 8.2(a)_ or _8.2(b)_ (with respect to an Order imposed by a
Government Antitrust

 



      
 

 



 

Entity), (ii) at the time of such termination, all conditions to the Closing
set forth in this Agreement, other than the condition set forth in _Section
7.1(a)_ (with respect to an Order imposed by a Government Antitrust Entity),
_Section 7.1(c)_ and/or _Section 7.2(d)_ (with respect to a legal proceeding
involving antitrust and/or competition Law) were satisfied or waived (other
than those conditions that by their terms are to be satisfied at the Closing
but which conditions would be satisfied or would be capable of being satisfied
if the Closing Date were the date of such termination), and (iii) at the time
of such termination, the condition set forth in _Section 7.1(a)_ (with
respect to an Order imposed by a Government Antitrust Entity), _Section
7.1(c)_ or _Section 7.2(d)_ (with respect to a legal proceeding involving
antitrust and/or competition Law) has not been satisfied, then Parent shall
promptly, but in no event later than two (2) business days after the date of
such termination, pay the Company the Termination Fee, payable by wire
transfer of immediately available funds to such account as the Company may
designate in writing to Parent; _provided_ that Parent shall not be obligated
to pay the Company a Termination Fee under this _Section 8.5(c)_ if the
Company has breached its obligations under _Section 6.3(g)_ in any manner
that shall have contributed in any material respect to the failure of the
conditions set forth in _Section 7.1(a)_ (with respect to an Order imposed by
a Government Antitrust Entity), _Section 7.1(c)_ or _Section 7.2(d) _(with
respect to a legal proceeding involving antitrust and/or competition Law) to
be satisfied.

 



 

(d) Whether or not the Merger is consummated, all costs and expenses incurred
in connection with this Agreement and the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement shall be paid by the party incurring such
expense; _provided_ , _however_ , that if this Agreement is terminated
pursuant to _Sections 8.2(a)_, _8.2(c)_ or _8.4(b)_ , and prior to the time
of termination and after the date of this Agreement a _bona fide_ Acquisition
Proposal shall have been publicly announced or otherwise communicated to the
board of directors of the Company and not withdrawn prior to the date of such
termination, the Company shall reimburse Parent for its documented out-of-
pocket expenses up to a maximum of $15,000,000 (the " _Reimbursable Expenses_
") promptly following receipt of an invoice from Parent documenting such
expenses. Any Reimbursable Expenses paid to Parent shall be credited against
any Termination Fee paid to Parent.

 



 

(e) The parties acknowledge that the agreements contained in this _Section
8.5_ are an integral part of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement,
and that, without these agreements, the parties would not enter into this
Agreement. Accordingly, if (1) the Company fails to promptly effect the
transfer of the amounts due pursuant to _Section 8.5(b)_ or _Section
8.5(d)_, including through the funding and transfer of Irish Holdco as
contemplated in _Section 8.5(b)_, or (2) Parent fails to promptly pay the
amounts due pursuant to _Section 8.5(b)_ or _Section 8.5(c)_ (for purposes
of this _Section 8.5(e)_, the party obligated to make a payment, the "
_Paying Party_ " and the party entitled to receive a payment, the " _Receiving
Party_ ") and in order to obtain such payment, the Receiving Party commences a
suit that results in a judgment against the Paying Party, the Paying Party
shall pay to the Receiving Party its costs and expenses (including attorneys
fees) in connection with such suit, together with interest on the amount of
such amount or portion thereof at the U.S. prime rate as shown at the end of
the day on Bloomberg screen BTMM or PRIME INDEX HP, whichever is higher, on
the date such payment was required to be made through the date of payment. If
a Termination Fee is required to be paid pursuant to Section 8.5, the
Receiving Partys right to the Termination Fee from the Paying Party pursuant
to this _Section 8.5_ and any additional amounts pursuant to this _Section
8.5(e)_ shall be

 



      
 

 



 

the sole and exclusive remedies of the Receiving Party and its respective
Affiliates against the Paying Party, its Subsidiaries and any of their
respective former, current, or future general or limited partners,
stockholders, directors, officers, managers, members, Affiliates, agents or
other Representatives for any loss suffered as a result of any breach of any
covenant or agreement in this Agreement or the failure the Merger or the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement to be consummated, and upon
payment of such amount, none of the Paying Party, its Subsidiaries or any of
their respective former, current, or future general or limited partners,
stockholders, directors, officers, managers, members, Affiliates, agents or
other Representatives shall have any further liability or obligation relating
to or arising out of this Agreement or the Merger or the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement; _provided further_ , _however_ , that in no
event will the Receiving Party be entitled to both the payment of the
Termination Fee, and specific performance of this Agreement and in no event
shall the Paying Party be required to pay the Termination Fee on more than one
occasion. The parties hereto expressly acknowledge and agree that: (i) in
light of the difficulty of accurately determining actual damages with respect
to the foregoing, upon any such termination of this Agreement, where a
Receiving Party is entitled to receiving the Termination Fee, the payment of
the Termination Fee pursuant to _Section 8.5(b)_ or _Section 8.5(c)_,
respectively, and any additional amount due pursuant to this _Section
8.5(e)_, which constitutes a reasonable estimate of the monetary damages that
will be suffered by the Receiving Party by reason of breach or termination of
this Agreement, shall be in full and complete satisfaction of any and all
monetary damages of the Receiving Party arising out of or related to this
Agreement, the Merger or the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement
(including any breach by the Company, Parent Holdco, Parent or Merger Sub, as
applicable), the termination of this Agreement, the failure to consummate the
Merger or the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and any
claims or actions under applicable Law arising out of any such breach,
termination or failure; and (ii) in the event this Agreement is terminated
under circumstances where the Receiving Party is entitled to a Termination
Fee, in no event shall a Receiving Party be entitled to seek or obtain any
recovery or judgment in excess of the applicable Termination Fee (plus, in the
case that a Termination Fee is not timely paid, the amounts described in the
first sentence of this _Section 8.5(e)_) against the Paying Party, its
Subsidiaries or any of their respective former, current, or future general or
limited partners, stockholders, directors, officers, employees, managers,
members, Affiliates, agents or other Representatives or any of their
respective assets, and in no event shall the Receiving Party be entitled to
seek or obtain any other damages of any kind, including consequential,
special, indirect or punitive damages for, or with respect to, this Agreement
or the transactions contemplated hereby (including any breach by the Paying
Party), the termination of this Agreement, the failure to consummate the
Merger or the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement or any claims
or actions under applicable Law arising out of any such breach, termination or
failure; _provided_ , _however_ , that this _Section 8.5(e)_ shall not limit
the right of the parties hereto to specific performance of this Agreement
pursuant to _Section 9.5(c)_ prior to the termination of this Agreement in
accordance with its terms.

(c) The parties hereto agree that irreparable damage would occur if any
provision of this Agreement were not performed in accordance with the terms
hereof (and, more specifically, that irreparable damage would likewise occur
if any of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement were not consummated
and the Companys stockholders did not receive the aggregate consideration
payable to them in accordance with the terms and subject to the conditions of
this Agreement), and, accordingly, that the parties hereto shall be entitled
to an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement or to
enforce specifically the performance of the terms and provisions hereof

not rely upon the representations and warranties in this Agreement as

circumstance, is invalid or unenforceable, (a) a suitable and equitable
provision shall be substituted therefor in order to carry out, so far as may
be valid and enforceable, the intent and purpose of such invalid or
unenforceable provision and (b) the remainder of this Agreement and the
application of such provision to other Persons or circumstances shall not be
affected by such invalidity or unenforceability, nor shall such invalidity or
unenforceability affect the validity or enforceability of such provision, or
the application thereof, in any other jurisdiction.

(b) The parties have participated jointly in negotiating and drafting this
Agreement. In the event that an ambiguity or a question of intent or
interpretation arises, this Agreement shall be construed as if drafted jointly
by the parties, and no presumption or burden of proof shall arise favoring or
disfavoring any party by virtue of the authorship of any provision of this
Agreement.

 



 

(c) Each party hereto has or may have set forth information in its respective
disclosure letter in a section thereof that corresponds to the section of this
Agreement to which it relates. The fact that any item of information is
disclosed in a disclosure letter to this Agreement shall not be construed to

contemplated by this Agreement or otherwise materially impede the rights of
the stockholders of the Company under this Agreement. Any purported assignment

ARTICLE 1 
_OFFICES_

 



 

 _Section 1.01_ _. Registered Office._ The registered office of the
Corporation shall be in the City of Wilmington, County of New Castle, State of
Delaware.

 



 

 _Section 1.02_ _. Other Offices._ In addition to its registered office in
the State of Delaware, the Corporation may also have offices at such other
places both within and without the State of Delaware as the Board of Directors
may from time to time determine or the business of the Corporation may
require.

 



 

 _Section 1.03_ _. Books._ The books of the Corporation may be kept within or
without the State of Delaware as the Board of Directors may from time to time
determine or the business of the Corporation may require.

 



 

ARTICLE 2

 

 _MEETINGS OF STOCKHOLDERS_

 



 

 _Section 2.01_ _. Time and Place of Meetings._ All meetings of stockholders
shall be held at such place, either within or without the State of Delaware,
on such date and at such time as may be determined from time to time by the
Board of Directors (or the Chairman in the absence of a designation by the
Board of Directors).

 



 

 _Section 2.02_ _. Annual Meetings._ Unless directors are elected by written
consent in lieu of an annual meeting as permitted by the General Corporation
Law of the State of Delaware as the same exists or may hereafter be amended
(the "DGCL"), an annual meeting of stockholders, commencing with the year
2016, shall be held for the election of directors and to transact such other
business as may properly be brought before the meeting. Stockholders may,
unless the certificate of incorporation otherwise provides, act by written
consent to elect directors; provided, however, that if such consent is less
than unanimous, such action by written consent may be in lieu of holding an
annual meeting only if all of the directorships to which directors could be
elected at an annual meeting held at the effective time of such action are
vacant and are filled by such action.

 



      
 

 



 

 _Section 2.03_ _. Special Meetings._ Special meetings of stockholders may be
called by the Board of Directors or the Chairman of the Board and shall be
called by the Secretary at the request in writing of holders of record of a
majority of the outstanding capital stock of the Corporation entitled to vote.
Such request shall state the purpose or purposes of the proposed meeting.

 



 

 _Section 2.04_ _. Notice of Meetings and Adjourned Meetings; Waivers of
Notice._ (a) Whenever stockholders are required or permitted to take any
action at a meeting, a written notice of the meeting shall be given which
shall state the place, if any, date and hour of the meeting, the means of
remote communications, if any, by which stockholders and proxy holders may be
deemed to be present in person and vote at such meeting, and, in the case of a
special meeting, the purpose or purposes for which the meeting is called.
Unless otherwise provided by the DGCL, such notice shall be given not less
than ten (10) nor more than sixty (60) days before the date of the meeting to
each stockholder of record entitled to vote at such meeting. Unless these
bylaws otherwise require, when a meeting is adjourned to another time or place
(whether or not a quorum is present), notice need not be given of the
adjourned meeting if the time, place, if any, and the means of remote
communications, if any, by which stockholders and proxy holders may be deemed
to be present in person and vote at such meeting, are announced at the meeting
at which the adjournment is taken. At the adjourned meeting, the Corporation
may transact any business which might have been transacted at the original
meeting. If the adjournment is for more than thirty (30) days, or after the
adjournment a new record date is fixed for the adjourned meeting, a notice of
the adjourned meeting shall be given to each stockholder of record entitled to
vote at the meeting.

 



 

(b) A written waiver of any such notice signed by the person entitled thereto,
or a waiver by electronic transmission by the person entitled to notice,
whether before or after the time stated therein, shall be deemed equivalent to
notice. Attendance of a person at a meeting shall constitute a waiver of
notice of such meeting, except when the person attends the meeting for the
express purpose of objecting, at the beginning of the meeting, to the
transaction of any business because the meeting is not lawfully called or
convened. Business transacted at any special meeting of stockholders shall be
limited to the purposes stated in the notice.

 



 

 _Section 2.05_ _. Quorum._ Unless otherwise provided under the certificate
of incorporation, these bylaws or the DGCL, the presence, in person or by
proxy, of the holders of a majority of the outstanding capital stock of the
Corporation entitled to vote at a meeting of stockholders shall constitute a
quorum for the transaction of business. If, however, such quorum shall not be
present or represented at any meeting of the stockholders, a majority in
voting interest of the stockholders present in person or represented by proxy
may adjourn the meeting, without notice other than announcement at the
meeting, until a quorum shall be present or represented. At such adjourned
meeting at which a quorum shall be present or represented any business may be
transacted which might have been transacted at the meeting as originally
notified.

 



      
 

 



 

 _Section 2.06_ _. Voting._ (a) Unless otherwise provided in the certificate
of incorporation or the DGCL, each stockholder shall be entitled to one vote
for each outstanding share of capital stock of the Corporation held by such
stockholder. Any share of capital stock of the Corporation held by the
Corporation shall have no voting rights. Unless otherwise provided in the
DGCL, the certificate of incorporation or these bylaws, the affirmative vote
of a majority of the shares of capital stock of the Corporation present, in
person or by written proxy, at a meeting of stockholders and entitled to vote
on the subject matter shall be the act of the stockholders.

 



 

(b) Each stockholder entitled to vote at a meeting of stockholders or to
express consent or dissent to a corporate action in writing without a meeting
may authorize another person or persons to act for such stockholder by proxy,
appointed by an instrument in writing, subscribed by such stockholder or by
his attorney thereunto authorized, or by proxy sent by cable, telegram or by
any means of electronic communication permitted by law, which results in a
writing from such stockholder or by his attorney, and delivered to the
secretary of the meeting. No proxy shall be voted after three (3) years from
its date, unless said proxy provides for a longer period.

 



 

(c) Votes may be cast by any stockholder entitled to vote in person or by
proxy. In determining the number of votes cast for or against a proposal or
nominee, shares abstaining from voting on a matter (including elections) will
not be treated as a vote cast.

 



 

 _Section 2.07_ _. Action by Consent._ (a) Unless otherwise provided in the
certificate of incorporation and subject to the proviso in Section 2.02, any
action required to be taken at any annual or special meeting of stockholders,
or any action which may be taken at any annual or special meeting of
stockholders, may be taken without a meeting, without prior notice and without
a vote, if a consent or consents in writing, setting forth the action so
taken, shall be signed by the holders of outstanding capital stock having not
less than the minimum number of votes that would be necessary to authorize or
take such action at a meeting at which all shares entitled to vote thereon
were present and voted and shall be delivered to the Corporation by delivery
to its registered office in Delaware, its principal place of business, or an
officer or agent of the Corporation having custody of the book in which
proceedings of meetings of stockholders are recorded. Delivery made to the
Corporations registered office shall be by hand or by certified or registered
mail, return receipt requested. Prompt notice of the taking of the corporate
action without a meeting by less than unanimous written consent shall be given
to those stockholders who have not consented in writing and who, if the action
had been taken at a meeting, would have been entitled to notice of the meeting
if the record date for such meeting had been the date that written consents
signed by a sufficient number of stockholders to take the action were
delivered to the Corporation as provided in Section 2.07(b).

 



 

(b) Every written consent shall bear the date of signature of each stockholder
who signs the consent, and no written consent shall be effective to take the

 



      
 

 



 

corporate action referred to therein unless, within sixty (60) days of the
earliest dated consent delivered in the manner required by this section and
the DGCL to the Corporation, written consents signed by a sufficient number of
holders to take action are delivered to the Corporation by delivery to its
registered office in Delaware, its principal place of business or an officer
or agent of the Corporation having custody of the book in which proceedings of
meetings of stockholders are recorded. Delivery made to the Corporations
registered office shall be by hand or by certified or registered mail, return
receipt requested.

 



 

 _Section 2.08_ _. Organization._ At each meeting of stockholders, the
Chairman of the Board, if one shall have been elected, or in the Chairmans
absence or if one shall not have been elected, the director designated by the
vote of the majority of the directors present at such meeting, shall act as
chairman of the meeting. The Secretary (or in the Secretarys absence or
inability to act, the person whom the chairman of the meeting shall appoint
secretary of the meeting) shall act as secretary of the meeting and keep the
minutes thereof.

 



 

 _Section 2.09_ _. Order of Business._ The order of business at all meetings
of stockholders shall be as determined by the chairman of the meeting.

 



 

ARTICLE 3 
_DIRECTORS_

 



 

 _Section 3.01_ _. General Powers. _Except as otherwise provided in the DGCL

 _Section 3.02_ _. Number, Election and Term of Office._ The number of
directors which shall constitute the whole Board shall be fixed from time to
time by resolution of the Board of Directors but shall not be less than one or
more than nine. The directors shall be elected at the annual meeting of the
stockholders by written ballot, except as provided in Section 2.02 and Section
3.12 herein, and each director so elected shall hold office until such
directors successor is elected and qualified or until such directors earlier
death, resignation or removal.

 



 

Directors need not be stockholders.

 



 

 _Section 3.03_ _. Quorum and Manner of Acting._ Unless the certificate of
incorporation or these bylaws require a greater number, a majority of the
total number of directors shall constitute a quorum for the transaction of
business, and the affirmative vote of a majority of the directors present at a
meeting at which a quorum is present shall be the act of the Board of
Directors. When a meeting is adjourned to another time or place (whether or
not a quorum is present), notice need not be given of the adjourned meeting if
the time and place thereof are announced at the meeting at which the
adjournment is taken. At the adjourned meeting, the Board of Directors may
transact any business which might have been transacted at the original
meeting. If a quorum shall not be present at any meeting of the Board of
Directors the directors present

 



      
 

 



 

thereat shall adjourn the meeting, from time to time, without notice other
than announcement at the meeting, until a quorum shall be present.

 



 

 _Section 3.04_ _. Time and Place of Meetings._ The Board of Directors shall
hold its meetings at such place, either within or without the State of
Delaware, and at such time as may be determined from time to time by the Board
of Directors (or the Chairman in the absence of a determination by the Board
of Directors).

 



 

 _Section 3.05_ _. Annual Meeting._ The Board of Directors shall meet for the
purpose of organization, the election of officers and the transaction of other
business, as soon as practicable after each annual meeting of stockholders, on
the same day and at the same place where such annual meeting shall be held.
Notice of such meeting need not be given. In the event such annual meeting is
not so held, the annual meeting of the Board of Directors may be held at such
place either within or without the State of Delaware, on such date and at such
time as shall be specified in a notice thereof given as hereinafter provided
in Section 3.07 herein or in a waiver of notice thereof signed by any director
who chooses to waive the requirement of notice.

 



 

 _Section 3.06_ _. Regular Meetings._ After the place and time of regular
meetings of the Board of Directors shall have been determined and notice
thereof shall have been once given to each member of the Board of Directors,
regular meetings may be held without further notice being given.

 



 

 _Section 3.07_ _. Special Meetings. _Special meetings of the Board of
Directors may be called by the Chairman of the Board or the President and
shall be called by the Chairman of the Board, President or Secretary on the
written request of one director. Notice of special meetings of the Board of
Directors shall be given to each director at least three days before the date
of the meeting in such manner as is determined by the Board of Directors.

 



 

 _Section 3.08_ _. Committees._ The Board of Directors may designate one or
more committees, each committee to consist of one or more of the directors of
the Corporation. The Board may designate one or more directors as alternate
members of any committee, who may replace any absent or disqualified member at
any meeting of the committee. In the absence or disqualification of a member
of a committee, the member or members present at any meeting and not
disqualified from voting, whether or not such member or members constitute a
quorum, may unanimously appoint another member of the Board of Directors to
act at the meeting in the place of any such absent or disqualified member. Any
such committee, to the extent provided in the resolution of the Board of
Directors, shall have and may exercise all the powers and authority of the
Board of Directors in the management of the business and affairs of the
Corporation, and may authorize the seal of the Corporation to be affixed to
all papers which may require it; but no such committee shall have the power or
authority in reference to any of the following matters: (a) approving or
adopting, or recommending to the stockholders, any action or matter (other
than the election or removal of directors) expressly required by the DGCL to
be submitted to the stockholders for approval or (b)

 



      
 

 



 

adopting, amending or repealing any bylaw of the Corporation. Each committee
shall keep regular minutes of its meetings and report the same to the Board of
Directors when required.

 



 

 _Section 3.09_ _. Action by Consent._ Unless otherwise restricted by the
certificate of incorporation or these bylaws, any action required or permitted
to be taken at any meeting of the Board of Directors or of any committee
thereof may be taken without a meeting, if all members of the Board or
committee, as the case may be, consent thereto in writing or by electronic
transmission, and the writing or writings or electronic transmission or
transmissions, are filed with the minutes of proceedings of the Board or
committee. Such filing shall be in paper form if the minutes are maintained in
paper form and shall be in electronic form if the minutes are maintained in
electronic form.

 



 

 _Section 3.10_ _. Telephonic Meetings._ Unless otherwise restricted by the
certificate of incorporation or these bylaws, members of the Board of
Directors, or any committee designated by the Board of Directors, may
participate in a meeting of the Board of Directors, or such committee, as the
case may be, by means of conference telephone or other communications
equipment by means of which all persons participating in the meeting can hear
each other, and such participation in a meeting shall constitute presence in
person at the meeting.

 



 

 _Section 3.11_ _. Resignation._ Any director may resign at any time by
giving notice in writing or by electronic transmission to the Board of
Directors or to the Secretary of the Corporation. The resignation of any
director shall take effect upon receipt of notice thereof or at such later
time as shall be specified in such notice; and unless otherwise specified
therein, the acceptance of such resignation shall not be necessary to make it
effective.

 



 

 _Section 3.12_ _. Vacancies._ Unless otherwise provided in the certificate
of incorporation, vacancies and newly created directorships resulting from any
increase in the authorized number of directors elected by all the stockholders
having the right to vote as a single class may be filled by a majority of the
directors then in office, although less than a quorum, or by a sole remaining
director. Whenever the holders of any class or classes of stock or series
thereof are entitled to elect one or more directors by the certificate of
incorporation, vacancies and newly created directorships of such class or
classes or series may be filled by a majority of directors elected by such
class or classes or series thereof then in office, or by a sole remaining
director so elected. Each director so chosen shall hold office until his or
her successor is elected and qualified, or until his or her earlier death,
resignation or removal. If there are no directors in office, then an election
of directors may be held in accordance with the DGCL. Unless otherwise
provided in the certificate of incorporation, when one or more directors shall
resign from the Board, effective at a future date, a majority of the directors
then in office, including those who have so resigned, shall have the power to
fill such vacancy or vacancies, the vote thereon to take effect when such
resignation or resignations shall become effective, and each director so
chosen shall hold office as

 



       
 

 



 

provided in the filling of other vacancies.

 



 

 _Section 3.13_ _. Removal._ Any director or the entire Board of Directors
may be removed, with or without cause, at any time by the affirmative vote of
the holders of a majority of the outstanding capital stock of the Corporation
then entitled to vote at any election of directors and the vacancies thus
created may be filled in accordance with Section 3.12 herein.

 



 

 _Section 3.14_ _. Compensation._ Unless otherwise restricted by the
certificate of incorporation or these bylaws, the Board of Directors shall
have authority to fix the compensation of directors, including fees and
reimbursement of expenses.

 _Section 4.01_ _. Principal Officers. _The principal officers of the
Corporation shall be a President, a Treasurer and a Secretary who shall have
the duty, among other things, to record the proceedings of the meetings of
stockholders and directors in a book kept for that purpose. The Corporation
may also have such other principal officers, including one or more
Controllers, as the Board may in its discretion appoint. One person may hold
the offices and perform the duties of any two or more of said offices, except
that no one person shall hold the offices and perform the duties of President
and Secretary.

 



 

 _Section 4.02_ _. Election, Term of Office and Remuneration._ The principal
officers of the Corporation shall be elected annually by the Board of
Directors at the annual meeting thereof. Each such officer shall hold office
until his or her successor is elected and qualified, or until his or her
earlier death, resignation or removal. The remuneration of all officers of the
Corporation shall be fixed by the Board of Directors. Any vacancy in any
office shall be filled in such manner as the Board of Directors shall
determine.

 



 

 _Section 4.03_ _. Subordinate Officers._ In addition to the principal
officers enumerated in Section 4.01 herein, the Corporation may have one or
more Assistant Treasurers, Assistant Secretaries and Assistant Controllers and
such other subordinate officers, agents and employees as the Board of
Directors may deem necessary, each of whom shall hold office for such period
as the Board of Directors may from time to time determine. The Board of
Directors may delegate to any principal officer the power to appoint and to
remove any such subordinate officers, agents or employees.

 



 

 _Section 4.04_ _. Removal._ Except as otherwise permitted with respect to
subordinate officers, any officer may be removed, with or without cause, at
any time, by resolution adopted by the Board of Directors.

 



 

 _Section 4.05_ _. Resignations._ Any officer may resign at any time by
giving written notice to the Board of Directors (or to a principal officer if
the Board of

 



      
 

 



 

Directors has delegated to such principal officer the power to appoint and to
remove such officer). The resignation of any officer shall take effect upon
receipt of notice thereof or at such later time as shall be specified in such
notice; and unless otherwise specified therein, the acceptance of such
resignation shall not be necessary to make it effective.

 



 

 _Section 4.06_ _. Powers and Duties._ The officers of the Corporation shall
have such powers and perform such duties incident to each of their respective
offices and such other duties as may from time to time be conferred upon or
assigned to them by the Board of Directors.

 _CAPITAL STOCK_

 



 

 _Section 5.01_ _. Certificates For Stock; Uncertificated Shares. _The shares
of the Corporation shall be represented by certificates, provided that the
Board of Directors of the Corporation may provide by resolution or resolutions
that some or all of any or all classes or series of its stock shall be
uncertificated shares. Any such resolution shall not apply to shares
represented by a certificate until such certificate is surrendered to the
Corporation. Except as otherwise provided by law, the rights and obligations
of the holders of uncertificated shares and the rights and obligations of the
holders of shares represented by certificates of the same class and series
shall be identical. Every holder of stock represented by certificates shall be
entitled to have a certificate signed by, or in the name of the Corporation by
the Chairman or Vice Chairman of the Board of Directors, or the President or
Vice President, and by the Treasurer or an assistant Treasurer or the
Secretary or an assistant Secretary of such Corporation representing the
number of shares registered in certificate form. Any or all of the signatures
on the certificate may be a facsimile. In case any officer, transfer agent or
registrar who has signed or whose facsimile signature has been placed upon a
certificate shall have ceased to be such officer, transfer agent or registrar
before such certificate is issued, it may be issued by the Corporation with
the same effect as if such person were such officer, transfer agent or
registrar at the date of issue. A Corporation shall not have power to issue a
certificate in bearer form.

 



 

 _Section 5.02_ _. Transfer of Shares._ Shares of the stock of the
Corporation may be transferred on the record of stockholders of the
Corporation by the holder thereof or by such holders duly authorized attorney
upon surrender of a certificate therefor properly endorsed or upon receipt of
proper transfer instructions from the registered holder of uncertificated
shares or by such holders duly authorized attorney and upon compliance with
appropriate procedures for transferring shares in uncertificated form, unless
waived by the Corporation.

 



 

 _Section 5.03_ _. Authority for Additional Rules Regarding Transfer. _The
Board of Directors shall have the power and authority to make all such rules
and regulations as they may deem expedient concerning the issue, transfer and
registration of certificated or uncertificated shares of the stock of the
Corporation, as well as for the issuance of

 



      
 

 



 

new certificates in lieu of those which may be lost or destroyed, and may
require of any stockholder requesting replacement of lost or destroyed
certificates, bond in such amount and in such form as they may deem expedient
to indemnify the Corporation, and/or the transfer agents, and/or the
registrars of its stock against any claims arising in connection therewith.

action, the Board of Directors may fix a record date, which record date shall
not precede the date upon which the resolution fixing the record date is
adopted, and which record date shall be not more than sixty (60) days prior to
such action. If no record date is fixed, the record date for determining
stockholders for any such purpose shall be at the close of business on the day
on which the Board of Directors adopts the resolution relating thereto.

ARTICLE II

 



 

 _Contingent Value Rights_

 



 

2.1 _CVRs_. The CVRs represent the rights of Holders to receive contingent
cash payments pursuant to this Agreement. The initial Holders shall be the (i)
holders of Shares other than Excluded Shares immediately prior to the
Effective Time and (ii) holders of Company Options and Company RSUs
immediately prior to the

 



      
 

 



 

Effective Time whose Company Options and Company RSUs are converted into the
right to receive the Per Share Merger Consideration pursuant to Article IV of
the Merger Agreement.

 



 

2.2 _Nontransferable_. The CVRs may not be sold, assigned, transferred,
pledged, encumbered or in any other manner transferred or disposed of, in
whole or in part, other than through a Permitted Transfer. Any attempted
transfer, in whole or in part, that is not a Permitted Transfer, will be void
ab initio and of no effect.

 



 

2.3 _No Certificate; Registration; Registration of Transfer; Change of
Address_.

 



 

(a) The CVRs shall not be evidenced by a certificate or other instrument.

 



 

(b) The Rights Agent shall keep a register (the " ** _CVR Register_** ") for
the purpose of registering CVRs and transfers of CVRs as herein provided. The
CVRs shall, in the case of the holders of Shares immediately prior to the
Effective Time, other than the Excluded Shares, be registered in the names and
addresses of the holder as set forth in the form Parent Holdco furnishes or
causes to be furnished to the Rights Agent pursuant to Section 4.1, and in a
denomination equal to the number of Shares converted into the right to receive
the Per Share Merger Consideration. The CVR Register will initially show one
position for Cede and Co representing all Shares held by DTC on behalf of street
holders held by such holders as of immediately prior to the Effective Time. In
the case of RSU Holders and Option Holders, the CVRs shall be registered in
the names and addresses of such RSU Holder or Option Holder, as applicable,
and in a denomination equal to the number of Shares subject to the outstanding
restricted stock units held by such RSU Holder immediately prior to the
Effective Time or the number of Shares underlying the outstanding stock
options held by such Option Holder immediately prior to the Effective Time, as
applicable, and, in each case, as set forth in a schedule delivered by the
Company to Parent Holdco (the " ** _Equity Awards Schedule_** "). The Rights
Agent hereby acknowledges the restrictions on transfer contained in Section
2.2 and agrees not to register a transfer which does not comply with Section
2.2.

 



 

(c) Subject to the restrictions on transferability set forth in Section 2.2,
every request made to transfer a CVR must be in writing and accompanied by a
written instrument of transfer and other requested documentation in form
reasonably satisfactory to the Rights Agent pursuant to its customary policies
and guidelines, duly executed by the Holder thereof, the Holders attorney
duly authorized in writing, the Holders personal representative or the
Holders survivor, and setting forth in reasonable detail the circumstances
relating to the transfer. Upon receipt of such written notice, the Rights
Agent shall, subject to its reasonable determination that the transfer
instrument is in proper form and the transfer otherwise complies with the
other terms and conditions of this Agreement (including the provisions of
Section 2.2), register the transfer of the CVRs in the CVR Register. Any
transfer of CVRs will be without charge (other than the cost of any Tax) to
the applicable Holder. The Rights Agent shall have no duty or

 



      
 

 



 

obligation to take any action under any section of this Agreement that
requires the payment by a Holder of a CVR of applicable Taxes or charges
unless and until the Rights Agent is satisfied that all such Taxes or charges
have been paid. All duly transferred CVRs registered in the CVR Register shall
be the valid obligations of Parent Holdco and shall entitle the transferee to
the same benefits and rights under this Agreement as those held immediately
prior to the transfer by the transferor. No transfer of a CVR shall be valid
until registered in the CVR Register.

 



 

(d) A Holder may make a written request to the Rights Agent to change such
Holders address of record in the CVR Register. The written request must be
duly executed by the Holder. Upon receipt of such written notice, the Rights
Agent shall, subject to its reasonable determination that the written notice
is in proper form, promptly record the change of address in the CVR Register.

 



 

2.4 _Payment Procedures_.

 



 

(a) If the Milestone occurs at any time prior to the expiration of the
Milestone Period, then, on or prior to the Milestone Payment Date, Parent
Holdco will deliver or cause to be delivered to the Rights Agent (i) a
certificate (the " ** _Milestone Achievement Certificate_** ") certifying the
date of the satisfaction of the Milestone and that the Holders are entitled to
receive the Milestone Payment and (ii) a wire transfer of immediately
available funds to an account designated by the Rights Agent, in the aggregate
amount equal to the number of CVRs (as reflected in the CVR Register) then
outstanding multiplied by the amount of the Milestone Payment (the " **
_Aggregate Milestone Payment_** "). After receipt of the wire transfer
described in the foregoing sentence, the Rights Agent will promptly (and in
any event, within five (5) Business Days) pay (x) by one lump sum wire payment
to DTC for any Holder who is a former street name holder of Shares and (y) for
all other Holders, by check mailed, first-class postage prepaid, to the
address of each Holder set forth in the CVR Register or by other method of
delivery as specified by the applicable Holder in writing to the Rights Agent
(such amount in (x) and (y) together, an amount in cash equal to Aggregate
Milestone Payment). The Rights Agent shall hold the Aggregate Milestone
Payment in a non-interest bearing account until such payment is made in
accordance with the foregoing sentence. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in no
event shall Parent Holdco be required to pay the Milestone Payment more than
once and Parent Holdco shall not be required to pay the Milestone Payment if
the Milestone occurs after the expiration of the Milestone Period.

 



 

(b) Parent Holdco or the Rights Agent shall be entitled to deduct or withhold
from the Milestone Payment, if payable, such amounts as may be required to be
deducted or withheld with respect to the Milestone Payment or CVR under the
Code, and the rules and regulations thereunder, or any other applicable
provision of state, local or foreign Law relating to Taxes, as may be
reasonably determined by Parent Holdco or the Rights Agent. Prior to making
any such Tax withholdings or causing any such Tax withholdings to be made with
respect to any Holder, the Rights Agent shall, to the extent practicable,
provide notice to the Holder of such potential withholding and, if applicable,

 



       
 

 



 

a reasonable opportunity for the Holder to provide any necessary Tax forms in
order to reduce or eliminate such withholding amounts. To the extent such
amounts are so deducted or withheld, such amounts shall be treated for all
purposes under this Agreement as having been paid to the person to whom such
amounts would otherwise have been paid, and prior to the fifteenth (15th) day
of February in the year following any payment of such Taxes by Parent Holdco
or the Rights Agent, the Rights Agent shall deliver to the person to whom such
amounts would otherwise have been paid the original Form 1099 or other
reasonably acceptable evidence of such withholding.

 



 

(c) Any portion of any Milestone Payment that remains undistributed to the
Holders six (6) months after the date of the Milestone Achievement Certificate
shall be delivered by the Rights Agent to Parent Holdco, upon demand, and any
Holder shall thereafter look only to Parent Holdco for payment of such
Milestone Payment, without interest, but such Holder shall have no greater
rights against Parent Holdco than those accorded to general unsecured
creditors of Parent Holdco under applicable Law.

 



 

(d) Neither Parent Holdco nor the Rights Agent shall be liable to any person
in respect of any Milestone Payment delivered to a public official in
compliance with any applicable state, federal or other abandoned property,
escheat or similar Law. If, despite Parent Holdcos and/or the Rights Agents
reasonable best efforts to deliver a Milestone Payment to the applicable
Holder, such Milestone Payment has not been paid prior to the date on which
such Milestone Payment would otherwise escheat to or become the property of
any Governmental Entity, any such Milestone Payment shall, to the extent
permitted by applicable Law, immediately prior to such time become the
property of Parent Holdco, free and clear of all claims or interest of any
person previously entitled thereto. In addition to and not in limitation of
any other indemnity obligation herein, Parent Holdco agrees to indemnify and
hold harmless the Rights Agent with respect to any liability, penalty, cost or
expense the Rights Agent may incur or be subject to in connection with
transferring such property to Parent Holdco.

 



 

(e) Except to the extent any portion of any Milestone Payment is required to
be treated as imputed interest pursuant to applicable Law, the Parties agree
to treat the CVRs and the Milestone Payment received with respect to the
Shares pursuant to the Merger Agreement for all U.S. federal and applicable
state and local income Tax purposes as additional consideration for the Shares
and none of the Parties will take any position to the contrary on any U.S.
federal and applicable state and local income Tax Return or for other U.S.
federal and applicable state and local income Tax purposes except as required
by applicable Law.

 



 

(f) The Parties agree, to the extent consistent with applicable law, to treat
the payments from the CVRs received with respect to the Company RSUs and
Company Options for all U.S. federal and applicable state and local income Tax
purposes as compensation payments (and not to treat the CVR as a payment
itself).

 



      
 

 



 

2.5 _No Voting, Dividends or Interest; No Equity or Ownership Interest in
Parent Holdco_.

 



 

(a) The CVRs shall not have any voting or dividend rights, and interest shall
not accrue on any amounts payable on the CVRs to any Holder.

 



 

The CVRs shall not represent any equity or ownership interest in Parent Holdco
or in any constituent company to the Merger or any of their respective
Affiliates.

 



 

2.6 _Enforcement of Rights of Holders_ Any actions seeking the enforcement of
the rights of Holders hereunder may be brought either by the Rights Agent or
the Acting Holders.

Parent Holdco in acting or refraining from acting upon any resolution,
certificate, statement, instrument, opinion, report, notice, request,
direction, consent, order or other paper or document believed by it in good
faith to be genuine and to have been signed or presented by the proper Party
or Parties;

 



 

(b) whenever the Rights Agent shall deem it desirable that a matter be proved
or established prior to taking, suffering or omitting any action hereunder,
the Rights Agent may rely upon an Officers Certificate, which certificate
shall be full authorization and protection to the Rights Agent, and the Rights
Agent shall, in the absence of bad faith on its part, incur no liability and
be held harmless by Parent Holdco for or in respect of any action taken,
suffered or omitted to be taken by it under the provisions of this Agreement
in good faith reliance upon such certificate;

 



 

(c) the Rights Agent may engage and consult with counsel of its selection and

respect of the execution of such powers;

held harmless by Parent Holdco with respect to any of the statements of fact
or recitals contained in this Agreement or be required to verify the same, but
all such statements and recitals are and shall be deemed to have been made by
Parent Holdco only;

 



 

(g) the Rights Agent shall have no liability and shall be held harmless by
Parent Holdco in respect of the validity of this Agreement or the execution
and delivery hereof (except the due execution and delivery hereof by the
Rights Agent and the enforceability of this Agreement against the Rights Agent
assuming the due execution and delivery hereof by Parent Holdco), nor shall it
be responsible for any breach by Parent Holdco of any covenant or condition
contained in this Agreement;

 



 

(h) Parent Holdco agrees to indemnify the Rights Agent for, and hold the
Rights Agent harmless against, any loss, liability, claim, demand, suit or

and expenses of defending the Rights Agent against any claim, charge, demand,
suit or loss incurred without negligence, bad faith or willful or intentional
misconduct;

 



 

(i) the Rights Agent shall not be liable for consequential losses or damages
under any provision of this Agreement or for any consequential damages arising
out of any act or failure to act hereunder in the absence of gross negligence,
bad faith or willful or intentional misconduct on its part;

Taxes)). The Rights Agent shall also be entitled to reimbursement from Parent
Holdco for all reasonable and documented out-of-pocket expenses paid or
incurred by it in connection with the administration by the Rights Agent of
its duties hereunder; and

 



 

(k) No provision of this Agreement shall require the Rights Agent to expend or
risk its own funds or otherwise incur any financial liability in the
performance of any of its duties hereunder or in the exercise of its rights if
there shall be reasonable

 



      
 

 



 

grounds for believing that repayment of such funds or adequate indemnification

3.3 _Resignation and Removal; Appointment of Successor_.

 



 

(a) The Rights Agent may resign at any time by giving written notice thereof
to Parent Holdco specifying a date when such resignation shall take effect,
which notice shall be sent at least thirty (30) days prior to the date so
specified, but in no event shall such resignation become effective until a
successor Rights Agent has been appointed. Parent Holdco has the right to
remove the Rights Agent at any time by a Board Resolution specifying a date

removal shall be given by Parent Holdco to the Rights Agent, which notice
shall be sent at least thirty (30) days prior to the date so specified.

becomes incapable of acting, Parent Holdco, by a Board Resolution, shall, as
soon as is reasonably possible, appoint a qualified successor Rights Agent who
shall be a stock transfer agent of national reputation or the corporate trust

Rights Agent and each appointment of a successor Rights Agent by mailing

and addresses appear in the CVR Register. Each notice shall include the name
and address of the successor Rights Agent. If Parent Holdco fails to send such
notice within ten (10) Business Days after acceptance of appointment by a
successor Rights Agent, the successor Rights Agent shall cause the notice to
be mailed at the expense of Parent Holdco.

 



 

(d) The Rights Agent will cooperate with Parent Holdco and any successor
Rights Agent in connection with the transition of the duties and
responsibilities of the Rights Agent to the successor Rights Agent, including
transferring the CVR Register to the successor Rights Agent.

rights, powers, trusts and duties of the retiring Rights Agent. On request of
Parent Holdco or the successor Rights Agent, the retiring Rights Agent shall
execute and deliver an instrument transferring to the successor Rights Agent

the Rights Agent to each Holder of the Milestone Payment required to be paid
under the terms of this Agreement in accordance with Section 2.4(a), and (b)

6.5 _Governing Law; Jurisdiction; WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL_.

 



 

(a) THIS AGREEMENT SHALL BE DEEMED TO BE MADE IN AND IN ALL RESPECTS SHALL BE
INTERPRETED IN ACCORDANCE WITH, GOVERNED BY, AND CONSTRUED IN ACCORDANCE WITH,
THE LAWS OF THE STATE OF DELAWARE, WITHOUT GIVING EFFECT TO CONFLICTS OF LAWS
PRINCIPLES THEREOF THAT WOULD RESULT IN THE APPLICATION OF THE LAW OF ANY
OTHER STATE OR WOULD DIRECT A MATTER TO ANOTHER JURISDICTION. Each of the
Parties hereby irrevocably and unconditionally submits, for itself and its
property, to the exclusive personal jurisdiction of the Court of Chancery of
the State of Delaware, or, if (and only if) such court finds it lacks subject
matter jurisdiction, the Superior Court of the State of Delaware (Complex

any such action or proceeding may be heard and determined in the Court of
Chancery of the State of Delaware, or, if (and only if) such court finds it
lacks subject matter jurisdiction, the Superior Court of the State of Delaware

matter that is the subject of the action or proceeding is vested exclusively
in the federal courts of the United States of America, the federal court of
the United States of America located in the County of New Castle, Delaware, as
applicable, and any appellate court from any thereof, (iii) waives, to the
fullest extent it may legally and effectively do so, any objection that it may
now or hereafter have to the jurisdiction or laying of venue of any such
action or proceeding in such courts and (iv) waives, to the fullest extent
permitted by Law, the defense of an inconvenient forum to the maintenance of
such action or proceeding in such courts. Each of the Parties agrees that a

provided by Law. Each Party irrevocably consents to and grants any such court
jurisdiction over the person of such parties and, to the extent permitted by
Law, over the subject matter of such dispute and consents to service of
process inside or outside the territorial jurisdiction of the courts referred

Nothing in this Agreement will affect the right of any Party to serve process
in any other manner permitted by Law.

AGREEMENTS DELIVERED IN CONNECTION HEREWITH OR THE MERGER AND OTHER
TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY OR THEREBY. EACH PARTY CERTIFIES AND
ACKNOWLEDGES THAT (A) NO REPRESENTATIVE, AGENT OR ATTORNEY OF ANY OTHER PARTY
HAS REPRESENTED, EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE, THAT SUCH OTHER PARTY WOULD NOT, IN
THE EVENT OF LITIGATION, SEEK TO ENFORCE EITHER OF SUCH WAIVERS, (B) EACH
PARTY UNDERSTANDS AND HAS CONSIDERED THE IMPLICATIONS OF THIS WAIVER, (C) EACH
PARTY MAKES SUCH WAIVERS VOLUNTARILY, AND (D) EACH PARTY HAS BEEN INDUCED TO

remedies herein expressly conferred upon a party will be deemed cumulative

equity upon such party, and the exercise by a party of any one remedy will not
preclude the exercise of any other remedy.

 



 

6.7 _Entire Agreement_. This Agreement and the documents and instruments and
other agreements among the parties hereto as contemplated by or referred to
herein, constitute the entire agreement among the parties with respect to the
subject matter hereof and supersede all prior agreements and understandings,

Holder or other group of Holders will be entitled to exercise such rights. The
parties hereto hereby agree that irreparable damage may occur in the event
that any provision of this Agreement were not performed in accordance with its
specific terms or were otherwise breached, and that money damages or other
legal remedies may not be an adequate remedy for any such damages.
Accordingly, the parties hereto acknowledge and hereby agree that in the event
of any breach or threatened breach by Parent Holdco or Assignee (as such term
is defined below), on the one hand, or the Rights Agent or the Acting Holders,
on the other hand, of any of their respective covenants or obligations set
forth in this Agreement, Parent Holdco or Assignee, on the one hand, and the
Rights Agent or the Acting Holders, on the other hand, shall be entitled to

threatened breaches of this Agreement, by the other(s) (as applicable), and to
seek specific enforcement of the terms and provisions of this Agreement.

and the invalidity or unenforceability of any provision shall not affect the
validity or enforceability of the other provisions hereof. If any provision of
this

 



      
 

 



 

Agreement, or the application of such provision to any Person or any
circumstance, is invalid or unenforceable, (a) a suitable and equitable
provision shall be substituted therefor in order to carry out, so far as may
be valid and enforceable, the intent and purpose of such invalid or
unenforceable provision and (b) the remainder of this Agreement and the
application of such provision to other Persons or circumstances shall not be
affected by such invalidity or unenforceability, nor shall such invalidity or
unenforceability affect the validity or enforceability of such provision, or
the application of such provision, in any other jurisdiction.

 



 

6.10 _Assignment_. This Agreement shall not be assignable provided, however,
that (a) Parent Holdco may assign this agreement to a Person (each such
Person, an " ** _Assignee_** ") (i) which is a direct or indirect wholly-owned
subsidiaries of Parent Holdco, provided that Parent Holdco remains jointly and
severally liable, (ii) with the prior consent of the Acting Holders, whether
evidenced in writing or taken at a meeting of the Holders, or (iii) in
connection with a transaction involving an Assignment Transaction conducted in
compliance with Section 4.3 and (b) the Rights Agent may assign this Agreement
to a successor Rights Agent appointed in accordance with Section 3.3.

contained herein, any Holder may at any time agree to renounce, in whole or in
part, whether or not for consideration, such Holders rights under this
Agreement by written notice to the Rights Agent and Parent Holdco, which
notice, if given, shall be irrevocable. Parent Holdco may, in its sole
discretion, at any time, offer consideration to Holders in exchange for their
agreement to irrevocably renounce their rights hereunder.

 



 

6.12 _Legal Holidays_. In the event that any Milestone Payment Date shall not
be a Business Day, then (notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to
the contrary) payment need not be made on such date, but may be made, without
the accrual of any additional interest thereon on account of such Milestone
Payment Date not being a Business Day, on the next succeeding Business Day
with the same force and effect as if made on such Milestone Payment Date.

 



 

6.13 _Interpretation; Construction_.

 



 

(a) The table of contents and headings herein are for convenience of reference
only, do not constitute part of this Agreement and shall not be deemed to
limit or otherwise affect any of the provisions hereof.

 



 

(b) The parties have participated jointly in negotiating and drafting this
Agreement. In the event that an ambiguity or a question of intent or
interpretation arises, this Agreement shall be construed as if drafted jointly
by the parties, and no presumption or burden of proof shall arise favoring or
disfavoring any party by virtue of the authorship of any provision of this
Agreement.
