ARTICLE III 
  
  EXCHANGE OF CERTIFICATES

  

Section 3.01 _Paying Agent_. Prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall enter
into an agreement (in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the
Company) with the Paying Agent to act as paying agent for the payment of the
Merger Consideration upon surrender of the Certificates pursuant to this
_Article III_ , in the case of certificated Shares, and automatically, in the
case of Book-Entry Shares. Immediately prior to the Effective Time, Parent
shall deposit with the Paying Agent cash in the aggregate amount required to
pay the Merger Consideration in respect of the Shares (such cash amount being
referred to herein as the " _Exchange Fund_ "). The

  

 

16  

  

Exchange Fund shall be used solely for purposes of paying the Merger
Consideration in accordance with this _Article III_ and shall not be used to
satisfy any other obligation of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries.
Pending distribution of the Exchange Fund in accordance with this _Article
III_ , Parent may direct the Paying Agent to invest such cash; _provided_ ,
that (a) no such investment or losses thereon shall affect the Merger
Consideration payable to the Company Stockholders and following any losses
Parent shall promptly provide additional funds to the Paying Agent for the
benefit of the Company Stockholders in the amount of any such losses and (b)
such investments (i) shall be obligations of or guaranteed by the United
States, commercial paper obligations receiving the highest rating from either
Moody\'s Investors Services, Inc. or Standard and Poor\'s Corporation, or
certificates of deposit, bank repurchase agreements or bankers acceptances of
domestic commercial banks with capital exceeding $5 billion (collectively "
_Permitted Investments_ ") or money market funds that are invested solely in
Permitted Investments and (ii) shall have maturities that will not prevent or
delay payments to be made pursuant to this _Article III_. Any income from
investment of the Exchange Fund will be payable solely to Parent. The
Surviving Corporation shall pay all charges and expenses, including those of
the Paying Agent, in connection with the exchange of Shares for the Merger
Consideration.

  

Section 3.02 _Exchange Procedures_.

  

(a) As promptly as practicable and in any event within two (2) Business Days
after the Effective Time, the Paying Agent shall mail to each holder of record
of a Certificate or Certificates that, immediately prior to the Effective
Time, represented outstanding Shares subsequently converted into the right to
receive the Merger Consideration, as set forth in _Section 2.04_ : (i) a
letter of transmittal (a " _Letter of Transmittal_ ") that (A) shall specify
that delivery shall be effected and risk of loss and title to the Certificates
shall pass only upon proper delivery of the Certificates to the Paying Agent
(or an affidavit of loss in lieu thereof, together with any bond or indemnity
agreement, as contemplated by _Section 3.06_ ) and (B) shall be in such form
and have such other provisions as the Surviving Corporation may specify,
subject to the Company\'s reasonable approval (to be sought prior to the
Effective Time) and (ii) instructions for use in effecting the surrender of
the Certificates in exchange for the Merger Consideration payable in
accordance with this _Article III_.

  

(b) Upon surrender of a Certificate for cancellation to the Paying Agent,
together with a Letter of Transmittal, duly completed and executed, and any
other documents reasonably required by the Paying Agent or the Surviving
Corporation, (i) the holder of such Certificate shall be entitled to receive
in exchange therefor a check representing the Merger Consideration that such
holder has the right to receive pursuant to _Section 2.04_ and (ii) the
Certificate so surrendered shall forthwith be canceled. No interest shall be
paid or accrued on the cash payable upon surrender of the Certificates. Until
surrendered as contemplated by this _Section 3.02_ , each such Certificate
shall be deemed at any time after the Effective Time to represent only the
right to receive upon such surrender the applicable Merger Consideration in
accordance with this Agreement.

  

(c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, any
holder of Book-Entry Shares shall not be required to deliver a Certificate or
an executed Letter of Transmittal to the Paying Agent to receive the Merger
Consideration that such holder is entitled to receive pursuant to this
_Article III_. In lieu thereof, each holder of record of one or more Book-

  

 

17  

  

Entry Shares whose Shares were converted into the right to receive the Merger
Consideration shall automatically upon the Effective Time (or, at any later
time at which such Book-Entry Shares shall be so converted) be entitled to
receive, and Parent shall cause the Paying Agent to pay and deliver as
promptly as practicable and in any event within three (3) Business Days after
the Effective Time, the Merger Consideration to which such holder is entitled
to receive pursuant to this _Article III_.

  

(d) In the event of a transfer of ownership of Shares that is not registered
in the transfer records of the Company, the appropriate amount of the Merger
Consideration may be paid to a transferee if the Certificate representing such
Shares is presented to the Paying Agent properly endorsed or accompanied by
appropriate stock powers and otherwise in proper form for transfer and
accompanied by all documents reasonably required by the Paying Agent to
evidence and effect such transfer and to evidence that any applicable Taxes
have been fully paid.

  

Section 3.03 _No Further Ownership Rights_. All Merger Consideration paid upon
the surrender for exchange of Shares in accordance with the terms hereof shall
be deemed to have been paid in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to
such Shares and, after the Effective Time, there shall be no further
registration of transfers on the transfer books of the Surviving Corporation
of the Shares that were issued and outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time. If, after the Effective Time, Certificates are presented to
the Surviving Corporation for any reason, they shall be canceled and exchanged
for the Merger Consideration as provided in this Agreement, subject to
applicable Law.

  

Section 3.04 _Termination of Exchange Fund_. Any portion of the Exchange Fund
(including any interest and other income received with respect thereto) that
remains undistributed to the former Company Stockholders on the date twelve
(12) months after the Effective Time shall be delivered to Parent upon demand,
and any former holder of Shares who has not theretofore received any
applicable Merger Consideration to which such Company Stockholder is entitled
under this _Article III_ shall thereafter look only to Parent (subject to
abandoned property, escheat or other similar Laws) for payment of claims with
respect thereto.

  

Section 3.05 _No Liability_. None of Parent, the Surviving Corporation or
Merger Sub or any of their respective Representatives shall be liable to any
holder of Shares for any part of the Merger Consideration delivered to a
public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or
similar Law. Any amounts remaining unclaimed by holders of any such Shares
twenty-four (24) months after the Effective Time or at such earlier date as is
immediately prior to the time at which such amounts would otherwise escheat
to, or become property of, any Governmental Authority shall, to the extent
permitted by applicable Law or Order, become the property of Parent free and
clear of any claims or interest of any such holders or their successors,
assigns or personal representatives previously entitled thereto.

  

Section 3.06 _Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates_. If any Certificate
shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of
that fact by the Person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or
destroyed and, if required by and at the discretion of Parent or the Surviving
Corporation, the posting by such Person of a bond in such reasonable amount as
Parent or the Surviving Corporation may direct, or the execution and delivery
by such Person of an indemnity agreement in such form as Parent or the
Surviving Corporation may direct, in each

  

 

18  

  

case as indemnity against any claim that may be made against it with respect
to such Certificate, the Paying Agent shall issue in exchange for such lost,
stolen or destroyed Certificate the Merger Consideration payable in respect of
the number of Shares formerly represented by such Certificate pursuant to this
_Article III_.

  

Section 3.07 _Withholding of Tax_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
contained in this Agreement, Parent, the Surviving Corporation, any Affiliate
thereof or the Paying Agent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from
amounts otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement to any holder of Shares,
Appraisal Shares, Company Stock Options and Company Restricted Stock, such
amounts as Parent, the Surviving Corporation, any Affiliate thereof or the
Paying Agent is required to deduct and withhold with respect to the making of
such payment under the Code or any provision of state, local or non-United
States Tax Law. To the extent that amounts are so withheld by Parent, the
Surviving Corporation, any Affiliate thereof, or the Paying Agent and are paid
over to the applicable Governmental Authority in accordance with applicable
Law or Order, such withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this
Agreement as having been paid to the Person in respect of which such deduction
and withholding was made.

Parent and Merger Sub, upon not less than two (2) days\' prior written notice,
which shall be directed to the Company\'s General Counsel, reasonable access
during normal business hours to the officers, agents,

  

 

41  

  

properties, offices and other facilities, books and records of the Company.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries
shall be obligated to provide any such access or information to the extent
that doing so (i) would be reasonably be expected to cause a waiver of an
attorney-client privilege or loss of attorney work product protection, (ii)
would constitute a violation of any applicable Law, (iii) would violate any
Contract to which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is a party or bound
or (iv) would interfere unreasonably with the business or operations of the
Company or its Subsidiaries or would otherwise result in significant
interference with the prompt and timely discharge by their respective
employees of their normal duties. Without limiting the foregoing, in the event
that the Company does not provide access or information in reliance on the
immediately preceding sentence, it shall provide notice to Parent that it is
withholding such access or information and shall use its reasonable best
efforts to communicate, to the extent feasible, the applicable information in
a way that would not risk waiver of such privilege, violate the applicable
Law, Contract or interfere unreasonably.

  

(b) Except for disclosures expressly permitted by the terms of the
Confidentiality Agreement, Parent and Merger Sub shall hold, and shall cause
their respective Representatives to hold, all information received, directly
or indirectly, from the Company or its Representatives in confidence in

the extent of any conflict between the provisions of the Confidentiality
Agreement and this Agreement, the terms of this Agreement shall govern.

  

(c) The Company shall promptly notify Parent after becoming aware of any
material dispute between the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, on the one
hand, and any of CUMIS, any Top 10 Program Counterparty or any Top 10 Program
Reinsurer, on the other hand, or of any expressed intent of any such Person to
terminate or not renew or to materially amend or modify, its relationship with
the Company and its Subsidiaries; _provided_ , that the Company\'s
obligations, actions or inactions pursuant to this _Section 6.02(c)_ shall be
deemed excluded for purposes of determining whether the conditions set forth
in _Section 7.02(b)_ are satisfied.

  

Section 6.03 _Reasonable Best Efforts to Consummate Merger; Regulatory
Matters_.

  

(a) Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement,
each of Parent, Merger Sub and the Company shall, and shall cause their
respective Affiliates to, use its reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to
be taken (including in the case of Parent, agreeing to permit and cause the
Company and its Subsidiaries to take effective as of the Closing), all actions
and to do, or cause to be done and to assist and cooperate with the other
parties in doing, all things, necessary, proper or advisable to fulfill all
conditions applicable to such party pursuant to this Agreement and to
consummate and make effective, as promptly as practicable, the Merger and the
other transactions contemplated hereby, including, subject to the terms and
conditions of this Agreement, using reasonable best efforts to (i) obtain all
necessary, proper or advisable consents, approvals, authorizations or waivers
from Governmental Authorities and making all necessary, proper or advisable
registrations, filings and notices and taking all steps as may be necessary to
obtain a consent, approval, authorization or waiver from any Governmental
Authority (including under Insurance Laws and the HSR Act) and (ii) execute
and deliver any additional agreements, documents or instruments necessary,
proper or advisable to consummate the transactions contemplated by, and to
fully carry out the purposes of, this Agreement.

  

 

42  

  

(b) Without limiting the foregoing, but subject to _Section 6.03(c)_ , Parent
and its Affiliates shall use reasonable best efforts to avoid each and every
impediment under any applicable Law that may be asserted by, or Order that may
be entered with, any Governmental Authority with respect to this Agreement,
the Merger or any other transaction contemplated hereby so as to enable the
Closing to occur, in the most expeditious manner practicable, including using
reasonable best efforts to (i) obtain all consents, approvals, authorizations
or waivers of Governmental Authorities necessary, proper or advisable to
consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and secure the
expiration or termination of any applicable waiting period under the HSR Act,
(ii) resolve any objections that may be asserted by any Governmental Authority
with respect to the Merger or any other transaction contemplated hereby and
(iii) prevent the entry of, and have vacated, lifted, reversed or overturned,
any Order that would prevent, prohibit, restrict or delay the consummation of
the Merger or any other transaction contemplated hereby.

  

(c) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, Parent shall
not be obligated to take or refrain from taking, or agree to it, its
Affiliates, the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, taking or refraining from
taking, any action or to suffer to exist any condition, limitation,
restriction or requirement that, individually or in the aggregate with any
other actions, conditions, limitations, restrictions or requirements, would or
would reasonably be expected to result in a Burdensome Condition. A "
_Burdensome Condition_ " shall mean any action, omission, agreement or
requirement that, individually or in the aggregate, would reasonably be
expected to have a Company Material Adverse Effect or a Parent Regulatory
Material Adverse Effect. " _Parent Regulatory Material Adverse Effect_ " means
any change, event, effect or circumstance that, individually or in the
aggregate, has or would reasonably be expected to have a material adverse
effect on Parent and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole (provided that for
purposes of determining a Parent Regulatory Material Adverse Effect, the
business and the financial condition, results of operations and other
financial metrics of Parent and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, shall be
deemed to be of the same scale as those of the Company and its Subsidiaries,
taken as a whole). Except as approved by Parent (including as required by
_Section 6.03(a)_ ), the Company shall not, and shall not permit any of its
Subsidiaries to, make or agree to any concessions with a Governmental
Authority in order to obtain the approvals set forth in _Schedule I_. Prior to
Parent being entitled to invoke a Burdensome Condition, the parties and their
respective Representatives shall promptly confer in good faith in order to (i)
exchange and review their respective views and positions as to any Burdensome
Condition or potential Burdensome Condition and (ii) discuss and present to,
and engage with, the applicable Governmental Authority regarding any
approaches or actions that would avoid any actual Burdensome Condition or
mitigate its impact so it is no longer a Burdensome Condition.

  

(d) In furtherance of and without limiting the foregoing, (i) Parent shall
file, or cause to be filed, a "Form A" Acquisition of Control, together with
all exhibits, affidavits and certificates, with the Insurance Commissioner of
the State of Delaware, within ten (10) Business Days of the date hereof, (ii)
Parent shall file a "Form A" Acquisition of Control, together with all
exhibits, affidavits and certificates, with the Insurance Commissioner of the
State of Texas, within ten (10) Business Days of the date hereof, (iii) each

to the HSR Act with the Federal Trade Commission and the Antitrust Division of
the United States Department of Justice with respect to the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement and requesting early termination of the waiting
period under the

  

 

43  

  

HSR Act, within ten (10) Business Days of the date hereof, (iv) Parent shall
file, or cause to be filed, any pre-acquisition notifications on "Form E" or
similar market share notifications to be filed in each jurisdiction where
required by applicable Laws with all required applicants, within ten (10)
Business Days of the date hereof and (v) the Company shall provide, within ten
(10) Business Days of the date hereof, applicable notice to the Insurance
Commissioner of the State of Texas under Texas Insurance Code §823.161. All
filing fees payable in connection with the foregoing shall be borne by Parent.
Parent agrees promptly to provide, or cause to be provided, all agreements,
documents, instruments or information that may be required or requested by any
Governmental Authority relating to Parent or its Affiliates or its or their
structure, ownership, businesses, operations, regulatory and legal compliance,
assets, liabilities, financing, financial condition or results of operations,
or any of its or their directors, officers, employees, partners, members or
shareholders. Prior to Closing, Parent and its Subsidiaries, in connection
with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, shall not file or submit
any application with or request for non-disapproval by any Governmental
Authority with respect to any inter-affiliate agreement or transaction between
any Company Insurance Subsidiary, on the one hand, and Parent or any of its
Subsidiaries, on the other hand, that would require approval or non-
disapproval under applicable Law or include reference to any such transaction
in the "Form A" Acquisition of Control filings.

  

(e) Each of the Company, Parent and Merger Sub agrees that it shall consult
with one another with respect to the obtaining of all consents, approvals,
authorizations or waivers of Governmental Authorities necessary, proper or
advisable to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and
each of the Company, Parent and Merger Sub shall keep the others apprised on a
prompt basis of the status of matters relating to such consents, approvals,
authorizations or waivers. Parent and the Company shall have the right to
review in advance, and to the extent practicable, and subject to any
restrictions under applicable Law, each shall consult the other on, any filing
made with, or written materials submitted to, any Governmental Authority in
connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and each party
agrees to in good faith consider and reasonably accept comments of the other
parties thereon. Parent and the Company shall promptly furnish to each other
copies of all such filings and written materials after their filing or
submission, in each case subject to applicable Laws. Parent and the Company
shall promptly advise each other upon receiving any communication from any
Governmental Authority whose consent, approval, authorization or waiver is
required to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement,
including promptly furnishing each other copies of any written or electronic
communication, and shall promptly advise each other when any such
communication causes such party to believe that there is a reasonable
likelihood that any such consent, approval, authorization or waiver will not
be obtained or that the receipt of any such consent, approval, authorization
or waiver will be materially delayed or conditioned. None of Parent, Merger
Sub and the Company shall, and shall cause their respective Affiliates not to,
permit any of their respective directors, officers, employees, partners,
members, shareholders or any other Representatives to participate in any live
or telephonic meeting (other than non-substantive scheduling or administrative
calls) with any Governmental Authority in respect of any filings,
investigation or other inquiry relating to the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement unless it consults with the other in advance and, to the extent
permitted by applicable Law and by such Governmental Authority, gives the
other party the opportunity to attend and participate in such meeting.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, in no event will any party be required to
disclose to any other party any personally identifiable

  

 

44  

  

information. For the avoidance of doubt, this _Section 6.03(e)_ shall not
apply with respect to Tax matters.

  

(f) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, in
no event shall the Company or its Affiliates be required to agree to take or

_however_ , that (A) without the prior written consent of Parent, the Company

upon the Closing and (2) Parent shall not be required to agree to make any

Statement, so that the Proxy Statement shall not contain any untrue statement
of a material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated
therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of the
circumstances under which they are made, not misleading,

  

 

45

this Agreement, the Merger and other transactions contemplated hereby by the
Company Stockholders and include such recommendation and the Company Board of
Directors\' determination that this Agreement, the Merger and the other

Recommendation Change in accordance with _Section 6.06_ , the Company shall,
solicit from the Company Stockholders proxies in favor of the proposal to
adopt this Agreement, the Merger and the other transactions contemplated

executive officer of the Company, certifying as to the total number of Shares
outstanding as of such date and the aggregate number of Shares for which

(ii) its Subsidiaries and its Subsidiaries\' directors and officers shall not
and (iii) it shall use reasonable best efforts to ensure that its and its
Subsidiaries\' Representatives shall not, directly or indirectly, (A) solicit,

with the Person that has made a Takeover Proposal (or its Representatives)
after the execution and delivery of this Agreement that has not been withdrawn
for the sole purpose of clarifying such Takeover Proposal; _provided_ , that
the Company shall promptly provide to Parent any material written
correspondence with any such Person or its Representatives and a written
summary of any material oral communications), (B) enter into, continue or
otherwise participate in any discussions or negotiations regarding, any
submission, proposal, offer or inquiry that constitutes or would reasonably be
expected to lead to a Takeover Proposal or furnish any non-public information

its Representatives) who has made any submission, proposal, offer or inquiry
that constitutes or would reasonably be expected to lead to a Takeover
Proposal, (C) terminate, waive, amend, release or modify any provision of any
confidentiality agreement to which the Company or any Subsidiary of the
Company is a party in connection with any Takeover Proposal or any submission,
proposal, offer or inquiry that would reasonably be expected to lead to any
Takeover Proposal (unless the Company Board of Directors determines in good
faith (after consultation with its outside counsel) that failure to do so
would be inconsistent with the fiduciary duties of directors under Delaware
Law), (D) enter into any letter of intent or agreement in principle or any
Contract concerning any Takeover Proposal or any submission, proposal, offer
or inquiry that would reasonably be expected to lead to a Takeover Proposal
(other than a confidentiality agreement in accordance with this _Section

Person (other than the Company\'s Representatives) in connection with any
Takeover Proposal or any submission, proposal, offer or inquiry that would

shall cause its Subsidiaries and direct its Representatives to, immediately
cease and cause to be terminated all then existing discussions and
negotiations with any Person conducted theretofore with respect to any
Takeover Proposal or any submission, proposal, offer or inquiry that would
reasonably be expected to lead to any Takeover Proposal. Notwithstanding the
foregoing or anything else in this Agreement to the contrary, at any time
prior to obtaining the Company Required Vote, in response to an unsolicited
written Takeover Proposal received after the execution and delivery of this
Agreement and prior to the Company obtaining the Company Required Vote, if the
Company Board of Directors determines in good faith, after consultation with
its financial advisor and outside counsel, that such Takeover Proposal
constitutes or would reasonably be expected to lead to a Superior Proposal,
the Company may (and may authorize and permit its Subsidiaries and
Representatives to), subject to compliance with this _Section 6.06(a)_ , prior
to obtaining the Company Required Vote, (x) furnish information with respect
to the Company and its Subsidiaries to the Person making such Takeover
Proposal (and its Representatives) pursuant to a confidentiality agreement
containing provisions substantially similar to those set forth in the
Confidentiality Agreement (provided that such

  

 

47  

  

confidentiality agreement need not contain a standstill), provided that all
such information has previously been provided to Parent or is provided to
Parent prior to or substantially concurrently with the time it is provided to
such Person or any of its Representatives, and (y) participate in discussions
and negotiations with the Person making such Takeover Proposal (and its
Representatives) regarding such Takeover Proposal.

  

(b) Neither the Company Board of Directors nor any committee thereof shall (i)
withdraw (or modify in a manner adverse to Parent), or publicly propose to
withdraw (or modify in a manner adverse to Parent), the approval, declaration
of fairness and advisability or recommendation by the Company Board of
Directors or any such committee of this Agreement, the Merger or the other
transactions contemplated hereby or fail to include such declaration or
recommendation in the Proxy Statement, (ii) approve, recommend the adoption
of, or publicly propose to approve or recommend the adoption of, any Takeover
Proposal, (iii) fail to publicly reaffirm the recommendation by the Company
Board of Directors of this Agreement, the Merger or the other transactions
contemplated hereby within five (5) Business Days of a written request by
Parent to make such public reaffirmation following the receipt by the Company
of a public Takeover Proposal (other than in the case of a Takeover Proposal
in the form of a tender offer or exchange offer) that has not been withdrawn;
provided that Parent may make any such request only once in any ten (10)
Business Day period with respect to a particular Takeover Proposal or (iv)
make any recommendation in connection with a tender offer or exchange offer
other than a recommendation against such offer or a "stop, look and listen"
communication by the Company Board of Directors of the type contemplated by
Rule 14d-9(f) under the Exchange Act, or fail to recommend against acceptance
of such a tender or exchange offer, including by taking no position with
respect to acceptance of such tender or exchange offer, by the close of
business on the earlier of (A) the tenth (10th) Business Day after the
commencement of such tender offer or exchange offer pursuant to Rule 14d-2
under the Exchange Act and (B) the third (3rd) Business Day prior to the
Company Stockholders Meeting (each, an " _Adverse Recommendation Change_ ").

  

(c) Notwithstanding the foregoing or anything else in this Agreement to the
contrary, at any time prior to obtaining the Company Required Vote, the
Company Board of Directors may, if, after consultation with its outside
counsel, it determines in good faith that the failure to take such action
would be inconsistent with the fiduciary duties of directors under Delaware
Law, (x) in response to an unsolicited Superior Proposal that has not been
withdrawn, make an Adverse Recommendation Change in response to such Superior
Proposal and, if it so determines, terminate this Agreement in order to enter
into a definitive agreement to effect such Superior Proposal or (y) make an
Adverse Recommendation Change (but not terminate this Agreement) in response
to a Change in Circumstances, in each case if and only if:

  

(i) the Company has materially complied with this _Section 6.06_ with respect
to such Takeover Proposal and the Person making such Takeover Proposal (and
such Person\'s Representatives);

  

(ii) the Company shall have given Parent notice at least three (3) Business
Days prior to making any such Adverse Recommendation Change or causing or
permitting the Company to terminate this Agreement pursuant to clause (x)
above in this _Section 6.06(c)_ , which notice shall include (A) the terms and
conditions of any Superior Proposal that is the basis of the proposed action
by the Company Board of Directors and

  

 

48  

  

a copy of all proposed documents to effect such Superior Proposal in the
possession of the Company or any of its Representatives (it being understood
and agreed that (1) any amendment to the financial terms of such Superior
Proposal shall require a new notice and an additional two (2) Business Day
period prior to taking any specified action and (2) in determining whether to
make an Adverse Recommendation Change or to cause or permit the Company to so
terminate this Agreement, the Company Board of Directors shall take into
account any changes to the terms of this Agreement proposed by Parent in
writing to the Company in response to any such notice or otherwise within the
periods described above) or (B) the material event or development or material
change in circumstance constituting such Change in Circumstances;

  

(iii) the Company has and has caused its Subsidiaries and its and their
respective Representatives to make themselves available to negotiate with
Parent and its Representatives during the period referred to in clause (ii) to
the extent requested in writing by Parent in order so that such Takeover
Proposal ceases to constitute a Superior Proposal or that such matter no
longer constitutes a Change in Circumstances; and

  

(iv) after considering any proposed revisions to this Agreement made by Parent
in writing during such periods described above, if any, the Company Board of
Directors shall have determined in good faith, after consultation with outside
counsel, that the failure to make the Adverse Recommendation Change in
response to such Superior Proposal or Change in Circumstances or cause or
permit the Company to terminate this Agreement in response to such Superior
Proposal would be inconsistent with the fiduciary duties of directors under
Delaware Law.

  

(d) In addition to the obligations of the Company set forth in _Section
6.06(a)_ and _Section 6.06(b)_ , the Company shall as promptly as practicable
(and in any event within twenty-four (24) hours after receipt thereof) advise
Parent of the receipt of any Takeover Proposal or any proposal, offer or
inquiry that would reasonably be expected to lead to a Takeover Proposal after
the date of this Agreement, the material terms and conditions of any such
Takeover Proposal and the identity of the Person making any such Takeover
Proposal. The Company shall keep Parent reasonably informed on a prompt basis
of any material developments with respect to any such Takeover Proposal,
proposal, offer or inquiry (including any material changes thereto) and shall
provide Parent as promptly as practicable (and in no event later than twenty-
four (24) hours after receipt or delivery of) any draft documents to effect
such Takeover Proposal, proposal or offer or any term sheets, indications or
interest or other material documents with respect to such Takeover Proposal,
proposal, offer or inquiry or that contain proposed terms of such Takeover
Proposal, proposal, offer or inquiry.

  

(e) Nothing contained in this _Section 6.06_ or elsewhere in this Agreement
shall prohibit the Company from (i) taking and disclosing to its stockholders
a position contemplated by Rule 14d-9 or Rule 14e-2(a) promulgated under the
Exchange Act or Item 1012(c) of Regulation M-A promulgated under the Exchange
Act or (ii) making any disclosure to its stockholders if the Company Board of
Directors determines (after consultation with its outside counsel) that
failure to do so would be inconsistent with the fiduciary duties of directors
under Delaware Law, it being understood, however, that (A) this _clause (ii)_
shall not be deemed to permit the Company Board of Directors to make an
Adverse Recommendation Change or take

  

 

49  

  

any of the actions referred to in _clause (ii)_ of _Section 6.06(b)_ except,
in each case, to the extent permitted by _Section 6.06(b)_ and (B) any
disclosure made pursuant to this _clause (ii)_ relating to any Takeover
Proposal or Change in Circumstances shall be deemed to be an Adverse
Recommendation Change unless it includes a reaffirmation by the Company Board
of Directors that the Company Board of Directors continues to recommend that
the Company Stockholders adopt this Agreement, the Merger and the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement and that the Company Board of
Directors believes this Agreement, the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement are fair to, advisable and in the best
interests of the Company and the Company Stockholders.

  

(f) In the event that the Company receives a Takeover Proposal during the
pendency of this Agreement, the Company hereby agrees that (i) notwithstanding
the standstill provisions contained in the Confidentiality Agreement, Parent
shall be permitted to propose to the Company one or more amendments to this
Agreement and (ii) Parent shall be permitted include as part of any such
amendments to this Agreement changes to reflect a joint bid structure with a
Third Party; _provided_ , such Third Party shall have agreed to bound by the
obligations imposed with respect to a "Recipient" in the Confidentiality
Agreement such that the Company can enforce the Confidentiality Agreement
(including the standstill provisions thereof) against such Third Party.

any of the transactions contemplated hereby and shall not issue any such press
release or make any such public statement without the prior consent of the
other party, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or
delayed; _provided_ , _however_ , that a party may, without the prior consent
of the other party, issue such press release or make such public statement (a)
as may be required by Law or Order, the applicable rules and regulations of
the NASDAQ Global Select Market or the New York Stock Exchange or any listing
agreement with the NASDAQ Global Select Market or the New York Stock Exchange,
(b) in connection with any Takeover Proposal or (c) to enforce its rights and
remedies under this Agreement.

(a) For the period from the Closing Date to December 31, 2018, Parent shall

in each case, no less than the base salary, annual bonus opportunities and

employment from the Closing Date to December 31, 2018 with severance payments
and

effect immediately prior to the Closing Date.

  

(c) Subject to _Section 6.08(f)_ , from and after the Closing Date, Parent

Employees full credit for Company Employees\' service with the Company and its

for purposes of benefit accruals under a defined benefit pension plan, under
any benefit plans made generally available to officers or employees or any
class or level of officers or employees maintained by Parent, the Surviving
Corporation or any of their respective Subsidiaries in which a Company
Employee participates to the same extent recognized by the Company immediately
prior to the Closing Date; _provided_ , _however_ , that such service shall
not be recognized to the extent that such recognition would result in a
duplication of benefits with respect to the same period of service.

  

(e) Parent shall, or shall cause the Surviving Corporation or Parent\'s or the
Surviving Corporation\'s Subsidiaries, as applicable, to (i) waive any
preexisting condition limitations otherwise applicable to Company Employees
and their eligible dependents under any plan of Parent or any Subsidiary of

that were in effect with respect to such employees as of the Closing Date
under the analogous Benefit Plan, (ii) honor any deductible, co-payment and
out-of-pocket maximums incurred by the Company Employees and their eligible
dependents under the health plans in which they participated immediately prior

maximums under health plans of Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any of
their respective Subsidiaries in which they are eligible to participate after
the Closing Date in the same plan year in which such deductibles, co-payments
or out-of-pocket maximums were incurred and (iii) waive any waiting period
limitation or evidence of insurability requirement that would otherwise be
applicable to a Company Employee and his or her eligible dependents on or
after the Closing Date, in each case to the extent such Company Employee or
eligible dependent had satisfied any similar limitation or requirement under
an analogous Benefit Plan prior to the Closing Date.

  

(f) This _Section 6.08_ shall be binding upon and shall inure solely to the
benefit of each of the parties to this Agreement and nothing in this _Section
6.08_ or any other provision of this Agreement or any other related Contract,
express or implied (i) shall be construed to establish, amend, or modify any
Benefit Plan or any other benefit plan, program, agreement or arrangement,
(ii) except as expressly provided by _Section 6.08(b)_ , shall alter or limit

Section 6.09 _Directors\' and Officers\' Indemnification and Insurance_.

  

(a) From and after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall, and

harmless the individuals who at or prior to the Effective Time were directors
or officers of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries (the " _Indemnified
Parties_ ") against all claims, liabilities, losses, damages, judgments,
fines, penalties, costs (including amounts paid in settlement or compromise)
and expenses (including legal fees and expenses) in connection with any actual
or threatened Action or investigation, whenever asserted, based on or arising
out of, relating to or in connection with any act or omission occurring at or
prior to the Effective Time (including relating to this Agreement) to the
fullest extent permitted by the DGCL or any other applicable Law or provided
under the Company Certificate of Incorporation and the Company Bylaws in
effect on the date hereof. Parent shall guarantee such performance by the
Surviving Corporation.

  

(b) From the Effective Time and for a period of six (6) years thereafter,
Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall maintain in effect directors\' and
officers\' liability insurance covering acts or omissions occurring at or
prior to the Effective Time with respect to Indemnified Parties with terms,
conditions, retentions and levels of coverage at least as favorable as those
of such current insurance coverage with an insurance carrier with the same or
better financial strength rating as the Company\'s current carrier; _provided_
, _however_ , that in no event will Parent or the Surviving Corporation be
required to expend in any one year an amount in excess of 300% of the annual
premiums currently paid by the Company for such insurance (the " _Maximum
Premium_ "); and _provided_ , _further_ , that, if the annual premiums for
such insurance coverage exceed the Maximum Premium, Parent and the Surviving
Corporation will be obligated to obtain a policy with the greatest coverage
available for a cost not exceeding such amount; and _provided_ , _further_ ,
_however_ , that at the Company\'s option in lieu of the foregoing insurance
coverage, the Company may purchase, prior to the Effective Time, six (6) year
"tail" insurance coverage that provides coverage identical in all material
respects to the coverage described above, provided that the Company does not
pay more than the Maximum Premium.

  

(c) Parent and the Company agree that all rights to indemnification and
exculpation from liabilities for acts or omissions occurring at or prior to
the Effective Time (and rights for advancement of expenses) now existing in
favor of the Indemnified Parties as provided in their respective certificates
of incorporation or bylaws (or comparable organizational documents) and any
indemnification or other agreements of the Company and its Subsidiaries as in
effect on the date of this Agreement shall be assumed by the Surviving
Corporation in the Merger, without further action, at the Effective Time and
shall survive the Merger and shall continue in full force and effect in
accordance with their terms. Further, the certificate of incorporation and
bylaws of the Surviving Corporation shall contain provisions no less favorable
with respect to indemnification, advancement of expenses and exculpation of
the Indemnified Parties than are presently set forth in the Company
Certificate of Incorporation and Company Bylaws, which provisions shall not be
amended, repealed or otherwise modified for a period of six (6) years from the
Effective Time in any manner that would adversely affect the rights thereunder
of any such individuals, except as amendments may be required by the DGCL
during such period.

  

 

52  

  

(d) This _Section 6.09_ shall survive the consummation of the Merger, is
intended to benefit, and shall be enforceable by each Indemnified Party and

all successors and assigns of Parent and the Surviving Corporation and shall
not be amended without the prior written consent of the applicable Indemnified
Party (including his or her successors, heirs and representatives).

  

(e) In the event that the Surviving Corporation or its successors or assigns
(i) consolidates with or merges into any other Person and shall not be the
continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation or merger
or (ii) transfers or conveys all or a majority of its properties and assets to
any Person, then, and in each such case, proper provision shall be made so
that the successors and assigns of the Surviving Corporation shall succeed to
the obligations set forth in this _Section 6.09_. In addition, the Surviving
Corporation shall not distribute, sell, transfer or otherwise dispose of any
of its assets in a manner that would reasonably be expected to render the
Surviving Corporation unable to satisfy its obligations under this _Section
6.09_.

  

(f) The rights of the Indemnified Parties under this _Section 6.09_ shall be
in addition to, and not in substitute for, any rights such Indemnified Parties
may have under the certificate of incorporation, bylaws or similar
organizational documents of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, or under
any applicable Contracts or Laws, and Parent shall, and shall cause the
Surviving Corporation to, honor and perform under all indemnification
agreements between any of the Indemnified Parties in their capacity as
directors or officers of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, on the one
hand, and the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, on the other hand, that are
set forth on _Section 6.09_ of the Company Disclosure Letter and have been
made available to Parent, in each case on the terms set forth in such
agreements as of the date hereof.

  

(g) Nothing in this Agreement is intended to, shall be construed to or shall
release, waive or impair any rights to directors\' and officers\' insurance
claims under any policy that is or has been in existence with respect to the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries for any of their respective directors,
officers or other employees, it being understood and agreed that the
indemnification provided for in this _Section 6.09_ is not prior to or in
substitution for any such claims under such policies.

  

Section 6.10 _Section 16 Matters_. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company
shall adopt resolutions to cause dispositions of Company equity securities
(including derivative securities) pursuant to the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement by each individual who is a director or officer of the Company
subject to Section 16 of the Exchange Act to be exempt under Rule 16b-2
promulgated under the Exchange Act.

  

Section 6.11 _Stock Exchange De-listing; Resignation of Directors_.

  

(a) Parent and the Company shall use their respective reasonable best efforts
to cause the Company\'s securities to be de-listed from the NASDAQ Global
Select Market and de-registered under the Exchange Act as soon as reasonably
practicable following the Effective Time.

  

 

53  

  

(b) The Company shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to deliver to
Parent at the Closing evidence reasonably satisfactory to Parent of the
resignation or removal of all directors of the Company and its Subsidiaries
specified by Parent in writing reasonably in advance of the Closing and in any
event at least five (5) Business Days prior to Closing, in each case effective
at the Effective Time.

this Agreement shall give Parent, directly or indirectly, the right to control
or direct the Company\'s or its Subsidiaries\' operations prior to the
Effective Time, and nothing contained in this Agreement shall give the
Company, directly or indirectly, the right to control or direct Parent\'s or
its Subsidiaries\' operations prior to the Effective Time. Prior to the

the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and shall keep Parent
reasonably informed regarding any such litigation. The Company shall give
Parent the opportunity to participate in, subject to a customary joint defense
agreement, but not control the defense of any such Action, shall give due
consideration to Parent\'s advice with respect to such Action and shall not
settle any such Action without the prior written consent of Parent, such

that for the purposes of this _Section 8.02(b)(ii)_ , (I) all references in
the term Takeover Proposal to "15% or more" shall be deemed to be references
to "more than 50%" and (II) in the case of a termination under _Section
8.01(c)_ , the definitive agreement or Takeover

  

 

58  

  

Proposal described in _clause (B)_ involves the Person who made the Takeover

(c) The parties acknowledge that the agreements contained in this _Section

without these agreements, the parties would not enter into this Agreement.
Accordingly, if the Company fails promptly to pay any amount due pursuant to
this _Section 8.02_ , the Company shall also pay any costs and expenses
(including reasonable legal fees and expenses) incurred by Parent in
connection with an Action to enforce this Agreement that results in an Order
for such amount against the Company. Any amount not paid when due pursuant to
this _Section 8.02_ shall bear interest from the date such amount is due until

(d) Subject to _Section 8.03(b)_ , upon termination of this Agreement in
accordance with its terms, Parent\'s right, if any, to receive the Company
Termination Fee pursuant to this _Section 8.02_ and the amounts described in

Sub and their respective Affiliates against the Company or its Subsidiaries
and any of their respective former, current or future stockholders, directors,
officers, employees, Affiliates, agents or other Representatives for any loss
suffered as a result of any breach of any representation, warranty, covenant
or agreement in this Agreement or the failure of the Merger or the

_Section 8.02(c)_ , none of the Company or its Subsidiaries or any of their
respective former, current or future stockholders, directors, officers,
employees, Affiliates, agents or other Representatives shall have any further
liability or obligation under this Agreement or the Merger or the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement.

  

Section 8.03 _Effect of Termination_. In the event of termination of this
Agreement by either the Company or Parent as provided in _Section 8.01_ , this
Agreement shall forthwith become void and have no effect, without any
liability or obligation on the part of Parent and Merger Sub or the Company,
except that (a) the provisions of _Section 6.02(b)_ , _Section 8.02_ , this
_Section 8.03_ and _Article IX_ shall survive termination and (b) nothing
herein shall relieve any party from liability for any Willful Breach of this
Agreement or for actual fraud (which shall not include constructive fraud or
similar claims); _provided_ , that if the Company is required to pay damages
pursuant to _Section 8.03(b)_ and also required to pay the Company Termination
Fee, then the amount of the Company Termination Fee shall be first offset
against any damages amount required to be paid by the Company pursuant to

or after the Company Required Vote has been obtained and prior to the filing
of the Certificate of Merger with the Delaware Secretary; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that, after the Company Required Vote shall have been obtained, no
such amendment, modification or supplement shall be made that pursuant to
applicable Law requires further adoption by the Company Stockholders without

adoption. This Agreement may not be amended, changed or supplemented or
otherwise modified except by an instrument in writing signed on behalf of all
of the parties.

each of the Company, Parent and Merger Sub may (a) extend the time for the
performance of any of the obligations or other acts of the other party, (b)
waive any inaccuracies in the representations and warranties of the other
party contained in this Agreement or in any document delivered pursuant to
this Agreement or (c) subject to the provisions of _Section 8.04_ , waive
compliance with any of the agreements or conditions of the other parties
contained in this Agreement. Any such extension or waiver by a party shall be
valid only if set forth in an instrument in writing signed on behalf of such
party. The failure of any party to this Agreement to assert any of its rights
under this Agreement or otherwise shall not constitute a waiver of those
rights.

shall become effective when one or more counterparts have been signed by each
of the parties and delivered (including by facsimile or other electronic

Section 9.04 _Entire Agreement; No Third-Party Beneficiaries_. This Agreement
and the Confidentiality Agreement (a) constitute the entire agreement, and
supersede all prior agreements and understandings, both written and oral,
among the parties, or any of them, with respect to the subject matter of this
Agreement and (b) are not intended to and do not confer upon any Person other
than the parties hereto any rights or remedies hereunder, other than, from and

Notwithstanding the foregoing, but subject to _Section 8.03_ , the Company
shall have the right to recover, through an Action

  

 

61  

  

brought by the Company, damages from Parent in the event of a breach of this
Agreement by Parent, in which event the damages recoverable by the Company for
itself and on behalf of the Company Stockholders and the holders of Company
Stock Options and Company Restricted Stock shall be determined by reference to
the total amount that would have been recoverable by such holders if all such
holders brought an action against Parent and were recognized as third party
beneficiaries hereunder. The representations, warranties, covenants and
agreements in this Agreement are the product of negotiations among the parties
and are for the sole benefit of the parties and may, in certain instances, be
qualified, limited or changed by confidential disclosure letters. Any
inaccuracies in such representations or warranties or failure to perform or
breach of such covenants or agreements are subject to waiver by the parties in
accordance with _Section 8.05_ without notice or liability to any other
Person. In some instances, the representations, warranties, covenants and
agreements in this Agreement may represent an allocation among the parties of
risk associated with particular matters regardless of the knowledge of any of
the parties. Consequently, Persons other than the parties may not rely upon
the representations, warranties, covenants and agreements in this Agreement as
characterizations of actual facts or circumstances as of the date of this
Agreement or as of any other date.

  

Section 9.05 _Assignment_. Neither this Agreement nor any of the rights,
interests or obligations under this Agreement shall be assigned or delegated,
in whole or in part, by operation of Law or otherwise by any of the parties
without the prior written consent of the other parties. Subject to the
preceding sentence, this Agreement will be binding upon, inure to the benefit
of, and be enforceable by, the parties and their respective successors and
assigns.

  

Section 9.06 _Governing Law_. This Agreement, and all claims or causes of
action (whether in contract, tort or otherwise) that may be based upon,
arising out of or relating to this Agreement or the negotiation, execution or
performance of this Agreement (including any claim or cause of action based
upon, arising out of or related to any representation or warranty made in or
in connection with this Agreement) shall be governed by and construed in
accordance with the Laws of the State of Delaware, without respect to its
applicable principles of conflicts of laws that might require the application
of the laws of another jurisdiction.

  

Section 9.07 _Consent to Jurisdiction_. Each of the parties hereby irrevocably
and unconditionally (a) submits, for itself and its property, to the exclusive
jurisdiction and venue of the Delaware Court of Chancery (or, only if the
Delaware Court of Chancery does not have jurisdiction over a particular
matter, the Superior Court of the State of Delaware (and the Complex
Commercial Litigation Division thereof if such division has jurisdiction over
the particular matter), or if the Superior Court of the State of Delaware does
not have jurisdiction, any federal court of the United States of America
sitting in the State of Delaware) (" _Delaware Courts_ "), and any appellate
court from any decision thereof, in any Action arising out of or relating to
this Agreement, including the negotiation, execution or performance of this
Agreement and agrees that all claims in respect of any such Action shall be
heard and determined in the Delaware Courts, (b) waives, to the fullest extent
it may legally and effectively do so, any objection which it may now or
hereafter have to the laying of venue of any Action arising out of or relating
to this Agreement or the negotiation, execution or performance of this
Agreement in the Delaware Courts, including any objection based on its place
of incorporation or domicile, (c) waives, to the fullest extent permitted by
Law, the defense of an inconvenient forum to the maintenance of such Action in
any such court and (d) agrees that a final judgment in any such

  

 

62  

  

Action shall be conclusive and may be enforced in other jurisdictions by suit
on the judgment or in any other manner provided by Law. Each of the parties
consents and agrees that service of process, summons, notice or document for
any action permitted hereunder may be delivered by registered mail addressed
to it at the applicable address set forth in _Section 9.02_ or in any other
manner permitted by applicable Law.

  

Section 9.08 _Waiver of Jury Trial_. EACH OF THE PARTIES ACKNOWLEDGES AND
AGREES THAT ANY CONTROVERSY THAT MAY BE BASED UPON, ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED
TO THIS AGREEMENT IS LIKELY TO INVOLVE COMPLICATED AND DIFFICULT ISSUES AND,
THEREFORE, EACH SUCH PARTY HEREBY IRREVOCABLY AND UNCONDITIONALLY WAIVES ANY
RIGHT SUCH PARTY MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY FOR ANY DISPUTE BASED UPON,
ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT OR THE BREACH, TERMINATION OR
VALIDITY HEREOF OR ANY TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED BY THIS AGREEMENT. EACH OF
THE PARTIES CERTIFIES AND ACKNOWLEDGES THAT (A) NEITHER THE OTHER PARTIES NOR
THEIR RESPECTIVE REPRESENTATIVES, AGENTS OR ATTORNEYS HAVE REPRESENTED,
EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE, THAT SUCH OTHER PARTY WOULD NOT, IN THE EVENT OF
LITIGATION, SEEK TO ENFORCE THE FOREGOING WAIVER, (B) EACH OF THE PARTIES
UNDERSTANDS AND HAS CONSIDERED THE IMPLICATIONS OF THIS WAIVER, (C) EACH OF
THE PARTIES MAKES THIS WAIVER VOLUNTARILY AND (D) EACH OF THE PARTIES HAS BEEN
INDUCED TO ENTER INTO THIS AGREEMENT BY, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE MUTUAL
WAIVERS AND CERTIFICATIONS OF THIS _SECTION 9.08_. ANY PARTY MAY FILE AN
ORIGINAL COUNTERPART OR A COPY OF THIS AGREEMENT WITH ANY COURT AS WRITTEN
EVIDENCE OF THE CONSENT OF THE PARTIES TO THE WAIVER OF THEIR RIGHT TO TRIAL
BY JURY.

  

Section 9.09 _Specific Performance_. The parties agree that irreparable damage
would occur and that the parties would not have any adequate remedy at law in
the event that any provision of this Agreement were not performed in
accordance with its specific terms or were otherwise breached and that money
damages or other legal remedies would not be an adequate remedy for any such
failure to perform or breach. It is accordingly agreed that, without posting a
bond or other undertaking, the parties shall be entitled to injunctive or
other equitable relief to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce
specifically the terms and provisions of this Agreement in the Delaware
Courts, this being in addition to any other remedy to which they are entitled
at law or in equity. In the event that any such action is brought in equity to
enforce the provisions of this Agreement, no party will allege, and each party
hereby waives the defense or counterclaim, that there is an adequate remedy at
law. The parties further agree that (a) by seeking any remedy provided for in
this _Section 9.09_ , a party shall not in any respect waive its right to seek
any other form of relief that may be available to such party under this
Agreement and (b) nothing contained in this _Section 9.09_ shall require any
party to institute any action for (or limit such party\'s right to institute
any action for) specific performance under this _Section 9.09_ before
exercising any other right under this Agreement. If, prior to the Outside
Termination Date, any party brings any Action in accordance with this
Agreement to enforce specifically the performance of the terms and provisions
hereof against any other party, the Outside Termination Date shall be
automatically extended (i) for the period during which such Action is pending,
plus

  

 

63  

  

ten (10) Business Days or (ii) by such other time period established by the
court presiding over such action on good cause shown, as the case may be.

  

Section 9.10 _Severability_. If any term, provision, covenant or restriction
of this Agreement is held by the Delaware Courts or other Governmental
Authority to be invalid, void or unenforceable, the remainder of the terms,
provisions, covenants and restrictions of this Agreement shall remain in full
