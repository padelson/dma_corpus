the Closing Date, the Buyer shall deliver to Seller a statement (the "Net
Working Capital Statement") of the Net Working Capital as of the Closing
without giving effect to any of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement and determined in accordance with the Applicable Accounting
Principles (as may be adjusted pursuant to Section 2.7(f) below, the "Final
Net Working Capital"), together with supporting calculations.

  

  

(b) For purposes of complying with the terms set forth in this Section 2.7,
each Party shall cooperate with and make available to the other Parties and
their respective Representatives all information, records, data and working
papers, and shall permit reasonable access to its officers, employees, agents,
books and records, as may be reasonably required in connection with the
preparation and analysis of the Net Working Capital Statement and the Final
Net Working Capital reflected in the Net Working Capital Statement and the
resolution of any disputes in connection with the Net Working Capital
Statement (in any case until the Accounting Expert has made a final
determination pursuant to Section 2.7(f) below, if applicable).

  

  

(c) If the Final Net Working Capital is less than the Net Working Capital
Estimate, then the Seller shall cause to be paid to the Buyer, as an
adjustment to the Cash Consideration, by wire transfer of immediately
available funds, an amount in cash equal to the difference between the Net
Working Capital Estimate and the Final Net Working Capital, within three (3)
Business Days after determination of Final Net Working Capital pursuant to
Section 2.7(f).

  

  

(d) If the Final Net Working Capital is greater than the Net Working Capital
Estimate, then Buyer shall cause to be paid to the Seller, as an adjustment to
the Cash Consideration, by wire transfer of immediately available funds, an
amount in cash equal to the difference between the Net Working Capital
Estimate and the Final Net Working Capital, within three (3) Business Days
after determination of Final Net Working Capital pursuant to Section 2.7(f).

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

18  

  

 

 

 

  

  

(e) If the Final Net Working Capital is equal to the Net Working Capital
Estimate, there shall be no payment by either the Buyer or the Seller pursuant
to this Section 2.7.

  

  

(f) Within 45 days following receipt by the Seller of the Net Working Capital
Statement, the Seller shall either inform the Buyer in writing that the Net
Working Capital Statement is acceptable, or deliver written notice (the
"Notice of Disagreement") to the Buyer of any dispute the Seller has with
respect to the preparation or content of the Net Working Capital Statement or
the Final Net Working Capital reflected in the Net Working Capital Statement.
The Notice of Disagreement must describe in reasonable detail the items
contained in the Net Working Capital Statement that the Seller disputes and
the disputed amount of any such disputes. Any items not identified on the
Notice of Disagreement shall be deemed agreed to by the Seller and all amounts
that are not in dispute shall be paid by the Party owing such payment by wire
transfer of immediately available funds no later than three (3) Business Days
after the time period in which the Seller may deliver the Notice of
Disagreement expires. If the Seller does not notify the Buyer of a dispute
with respect to the Net Working Capital Statement within such 45-day period,
such Net Working Capital Statement and the Final Net Working Capital reflected
in the Net Working Capital Statement will be final, conclusive and binding on
the Parties. In the event a Notice of Disagreement is delivered to the Buyer,
the Buyer and the Seller shall negotiate in good faith to resolve such
dispute. If the Buyer and the Seller, notwithstanding such good faith effort,
fail to resolve such dispute within ten (10) Business Days after the Seller
advises the Buyer of its objections, then the Buyer and the Seller jointly
shall engage the Accounting Expert to resolve such dispute in accordance with
the standards set forth in this Section 2.7(f). The Seller and the Buyer shall
use reasonable efforts to cause the Accounting Expert to render a written
decision resolving the matters submitted to the Accounting Expert within
thirty (30) days of the making of such submission. The scope of the disputes
to be resolved by the Accounting Expert shall be limited only to the items in
dispute that were included in the Notice of Disagreement and if such items
were calculated in accordance with Applicable Accounting Principles and the
Accounting Expert shall determine, on such basis, whether and to what extent,
the Net Working Capital Statement and the Final Net Working Capital reflected
in the Net Working Capital Statement, require adjustment. The Final Net
Working Capital, as adjusted by the Accounting Expert, shall be deemed the
Final Net Working Capital. The Accounting Expert is not to make any other
determination, including any determination as to whether the Net Working
Capital Estimate or Net Working Capital Target is correct. The Accounting
Expert's decision shall be based solely on presentations by the Buyer and the
Seller (and not independent review) and made in strict accordance with the
terms of this Agreement, without regard for principles of equity. The
Accounting Expert shall apply the relevant provisions of this Agreement to the
disputed amounts, and shall have no authority to alter, modify, amend, add to
or subtract from any term of provision of this Agreement. The Accounting
Expert shall not assign a value to any item in dispute greater than the
greatest value for such item assigned to it by the Buyer, on the one hand, or
the Seller, on the other hand, or less than the smallest value for such item
assigned to it by the Buyer, on the one hand, or the Seller, on the other
hand. The fees and expenses of the Accounting Expert shall be borne in the
same proportion that the aggregate dollar amount of such remaining disputed
items so submitted to the Accounting Expert that are unsuccessfully disputed
by the Buyer, on the one hand, and the Seller, on the other hand, as finally
determined by the Accounting Expert, bears to the total dollar amount of such
remaining disputed items so submitted. All determinations made by the
Accounting Expert will be final, conclusive and binding on the Parties.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

19  

  

 

 

 

  

  

Section 2.8 Purchase Price Allocation. Within one hundred twenty (120) days of
the Closing, the Parties shall agree on an allocation of the Purchase Price
(including any adjustments made thereto) and any liabilities assumed, for Tax
purposes, which shall be prepared in a manner consistent with fair market
value of the Purchased Assets and, as applicable, Section 1060 of the Code and
the Treasury Regulations promulgated thereunder (such allocation, the
"Purchase Price Allocation"). The Buyer shall prepare, and provide to the
Seller, a draft Purchase Price Allocation within ninety (90) days after
Closing. The Seller shall provide any comments to the draft Purchase Price
Allocation to the Buyer within twenty (20) days upon receipt thereof. If the
Seller does not provide any comments within the requisite time period, the
draft Purchase Price Allocation shall be treated as final. The Parties agree
to use the Purchase Price Allocation for all Tax purposes and in all filings,
declarations and reports with the Internal Revenue Service (the "IRS") in
respect thereof, including any reports required to be filed under Section 1060
of the Code and the Treasury Regulations promulgated thereunder. The Parties
shall timely file, or cause to be timely filed, IRS Form 8594 (or any
comparable form under state, local or foreign Tax Law) and any required
attachments thereto in accordance with the Purchase Price Allocation. Neither
the Buyer nor the Seller shall take any position in any Tax Return, audit, or
otherwise, that is inconsistent with the Purchase Price Allocation, nor shall
Buyer or Seller in any way represent that the Purchase Price Allocation is not
correct, unless otherwise required by applicable Law.

  

  

Section 2.9 Consents from Third Parties.

  

  

(a) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, this Agreement
shall not constitute an agreement to assign any asset (including any Permit)
or any claim or right or any benefit arising under or resulting from such
asset if an attempted assignment thereof, without the consent of a Third
Party, would constitute a breach or other contravention of the rights of such
Third Party, would be ineffective with respect to any party to an agreement
concerning such asset, or would in any way adversely affect the rights of the
Seller or, upon transfer, the Buyer under such asset. If any transfer or
assignment by the Seller to, or any assumption by the Buyer of, any interest
in or liability, obligation or commitment under any asset requires the consent
of a Third Party, then such assignment or assumption shall be made subject to
such consent being obtained. Subject to Section 6.5, the Parties shall use
their reasonable best efforts to obtain all permits, consents, approvals and
authorizations of all Third Parties that are necessary or advisable to
consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the other
Transaction Documents (e.g., with respect to the Leased Real Property,
Intellectual Property and other ordinary course Contracts). To the extent any
consent fees or compensation payments to a Third Party are required in
connection with the assignment of any asset (including any Permit), such cost
and expense shall be borne equally by the Buyer and the Seller.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

20  

  

 

 

 

  

  

(b) If any such consent or Permit transfer is not obtained prior to the
Closing, the Seller and the Buyer shall cooperate in any lawful and reasonable
arrangement reasonably proposed by the Buyer under which the Buyer shall
obtain the economic claims, rights and benefits under the asset, Permit
(including any foreign Permit), claim or right with respect to which the Third
Party consent has not been obtained in accordance with this Agreement. Such
reasonable arrangement may include (i) the subcontracting, sublicensing or
subleasing to the Buyer of any and all rights of the Seller against the other
Party to such Third Party agreement arising out of a breach or cancellation
thereof by the other Party, and (ii) the enforcement by the Seller of such
rights, with the Buyer being responsible for the performance and discharge of
the Seller's obligations, in each case, to the extent permitted by applicable
Law. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, from and
after the Closing, any and all costs and other expenses incurred by either
Party due to the Buyer's use of, or the Buyer's reliance on, any of the
Seller's Permits shall be borne exclusively by the Buyer, and the Buyer shall
indemnify the Seller for such costs and expenses, as well as any and all
Losses of the Seller Indemnified Parties relating to the Buyer's use of, or
reliance on, the Seller's Permits.

decree, judgment, injunction or other Order is entered, enforced or attempted
to be entered or enforced by a court or other Governmental Authority, which
decree, judgment, injunction or other Order would make the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement illegal or would otherwise prohibit, prevent,
restrict, impair or delay consummation of the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement, the Buyer shall use its reasonable best efforts to contest and
resist any such action or proceeding and to have vacated, lifted, reversed or
overturned any such decree, judgment, injunction or other Order, whether
temporary, preliminary or permanent, that is in effect and that prohibits,
prevents or restricts consummation of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement and to have such decree, judgment, injunction or other Order
repealed, rescinded or made inapplicable so as to permit consummation of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement; provided, however,
notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing in this Agreement shall require, or be
construed to require Buyer, in connection with the receipt of any regulatory
approval (including pursuant to the HSR Act) to proffer to, or agree to:

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

52  

  

 

 

 

  

  

(i) sell or hold separate and agree to sell, divest or to discontinue to or
limit, before or after the Closing Date, any assets, businesses, or interest
in any assets or businesses of Seller or any of its Affiliates or Subsidiaries
(or to consent to any sale, or agreement to sell, or discontinuance or
limitation by Buyer, as the case may be, of any of its assets or businesses);

  

  

(ii) any material conditions relating to, or material changes or material
restrictions in, the operations of any such asset or businesses; or

  

  

(iii) take any action that would, or would be reasonably likely to, impose any
material cost, liability or obligation on Buyer or any of its Affiliates or
Subsidiaries.

  

  

Section 6.7 Further Assurances. Subject to the terms and conditions of this
Agreement, each of the Parties shall use its reasonable best efforts to effect
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement in accordance with the terms

party to this Agreement, shall execute and deliver such other instruments and
do and perform such other acts and things as may be necessary or desirable for
effecting the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

  

  

Section 6.8 Public Announcements. The Parties agree that no press release or
public announcement, statement or disclosure concerning the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement shall be issued by any of the Parties without
the prior written consent of the Seller or the Buyer, as applicable, except as
such release or announcement may be required by applicable Law or applicable
stock exchange regulation (including Buyer making a public announcement
through the filing of a Current Report on Form 8-K upon execution of this
Agreement or otherwise), in which case, the party required to make the release
or announcement shall use its reasonable best efforts to allow the other party
reasonable time to comment on such release or announcement in advance of such
issuance.

  

  

Section 6.9 Fees and Expenses. Except as set forth in Section 6.6(a) and
except as otherwise provided in this Agreement, all fees and expenses incurred

or not the transactions contemplated under this Agreement are consummated.

  

  

Section 6.10 Employees and Employee Benefits.

  

  

(a) The Buyer shall be granted reasonable access to the Key Employees for the
purpose of discussing employment terms and shall offer employment effective on
the Closing to substantially all of the employees of the Seller as of the
Closing, including employees who are absent due to vacation, family leave,
short-term disability or other approved leave of absence. Any such employees
of the Seller as of the Closing who accept and continue employment with the
Buyer shall be referred to herein as the "Employees". Notwithstanding anything
to the contrary set forth herein, nothing herein shall preclude the Buyer from
terminating the employment of any Employee for any reason.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

53  

  

 

 

 

  

  

(b) The Buyer shall assume and honor all Plans other than the Home Meridian
International, Inc. Change in Control Bonus Plan (the "Assumed Plans") in
accordance with their terms as in effect immediately prior to the Closing,
subject to any amendment or termination thereof that may be permitted by such
Plans or as may be permitted under applicable law. The Buyer will pay or cause
to be paid any amounts that have been properly accrued and expensed under any
Old Plan (as defined herein) prior to the Closing that remain outstanding in
the ordinary course of business consistent with historical practice.

  

  

(c) For all purposes under the employee benefit plans of the Buyer and its
Affiliates providing benefits to any Employees after the Closing (the "New
Plans"), each Employee will be credited with his or her years of service with
the Seller prior to the Closing (including predecessor or acquired entities or
any other entities for which the Seller has given credit for prior service),
to the same extent as such Employee was entitled, prior to the Closing, to
credit for such service under the corresponding Assumed Plan, except (i) for
purposes of benefit accrual under any Assumed Plan that is a defined benefit
plan, (ii) for any purpose where service credit for the applicable period is
not provided to participants generally, or (iii) to the extent such credit
would result in a duplication of benefits. In addition, and without limiting
the generality of the foregoing (i) each Employee will be immediately eligible
to participate, without any waiting time, in any and all New Plans to the
extent coverage under such New Plan replaces coverage under a similar or
comparable Assumed Plan in which such Employee participated immediately prior
to the Closing (such plans, collectively, the "Old Plans") and (ii) the Buyer
will cause any eligible expenses incurred by such Employee and his or her
covered dependents during the portion of the plan year of the Old Plan ending
on the date such Employee's participation in the corresponding New Plan begins
to be taken into account under such New Plan for purposes of satisfying all
deductible, coinsurance and maximum out-of-pocket requirements applicable to
such Employee and his or her covered dependents for the applicable plan year
as if such amounts had been paid in accordance with such New Plan.

  

  

(d) The Seller shall: (i) terminate the Home Meridian International, Inc.
Employee Savings 401(k) Plan ("HMI 401(k) Plan") effective immediately prior
to the Closing Date, (ii) cause the account balances of all participants in
the HMI 401(k) Plan to be fully vested effective immediately prior to the
Closing Date; and (iii) take any actions necessary to ensure that the account
balances of participants in the HMI 401(k) Plan are distributable from the HMI
401(k) Plan on, or as administratively practicable after, the Closing Date. As
of the Closing Date, Buyer shall cover (or cause to be covered) each Employee
under a defined contribution plan qualified under Sections 401(a) and 401(k)
of the Code (the "Buyer DC Plan"). Buyer shall cause each Employee who (i) was
a participant in such HMI 401(k) Plan, (ii) has an account balance under the
HMI 401(k) Plan and (iii) who is then an employee of the Buyer to be permitted
to roll over such account balance (including any outstanding loan) to the
Buyer DC Plan, provided that such a rollover is elected by the eligible
Employee before the first anniversary of the Closing Date.

  

  

(e) From and after the Closing Date, Buyer shall be solely responsible for
providing continuation coverage (and giving any required notices related
thereto) under Section 4980B(f) of the Code and Part 6 of Subtitle B of Title
I of ERISA to those individuals who are MandA qualified beneficiaries (as
defined in Treasury Regulation Section 54.4980B-9, QandA-4(a)) with respect to
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

54  

  

 

 

 

  

  

(f) Prior to the Closing Date, the Seller shall (i) use commercially
reasonable efforts to obtain from each "disqualified individual" (as defined
in Section 280G(c) of the Code) a waiver by such individual of any and all
payments (or other benefits) contingent on the consummation of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement (within the meaning of Section
280G(b)(2)(A)(i) of the Code) to the extent necessary so that such payments
and benefits would not be "excess parachute payments" under Section 280G of
the Code and (ii) submit to its stockholders for a vote all such waived
payments in a manner such that, if such vote is adopted by the Seller\'s
stockholders in a manner that satisfies the stockholder approval requirements
under Section 280G(b)(5)(B) of the Code and regulations promulgated thereunder
(the "280G Shareholder Approval Procedures"), no payment received by such
"disqualified individual" would be a "parachute payment" under Section 280G(b)
of the Code (determined without regard to Section 280G(b)(4) of the Code).
Such vote shall establish the disqualified individual's right to the payment
or other compensation. Buyer shall provide the Seller with sufficient
information regarding any agreement between Buyer and any disqualified
individual to enable the Seller to obtain stockholder approval of any
compensation payable under such agreement in accordance with the 280G
Shareholder Approval Procedures. The Seller agrees to provide to Buyer written
drafts of the shareholder disclosure statement, waivers, and stockholder
approval forms that will be provided to disqualified individuals and
stockholders in advance of delivering such documents to the disqualified
individuals and stockholders, as applicable.

  

  

Section 6.11 Non-Solicitation; Non-Hire. The Seller shall not during the
period that is twelve (12) months following the Closing Date hire any Key
Employee employed by the Buyer as of the Closing Date, or solicit or induce,
or in any manner attempt to solicit or induce, any Key Employee employed by
the Buyer as of the Closing Date to terminate such Person's employment with
the Buyer; provided that the foregoing shall not be violated by (i) general
advertising not targeted at employees of the Buyer; or (ii) hiring or
soliciting any Person who has been terminated by the Buyer prior to the six
(6) month period prior to the date of such hiring or solicitation.

  

  

Section 6.12 Bulk Transfer Laws. The Parties hereby waive compliance with the
provisions of any bulk sales, bulk transfer or similar Laws of any
jurisdiction that may otherwise be applicable with respect to the sale of any
or all of the Purchased Assets to the Buyer, and Seller shall indemnify the
Buyer Indemnified Parties with respect thereto.

  

  

Section 6.13 Financing.

  

  

(a) The Buyer shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause the Financing
contemplated by the Commitment Letter, subject to the terms and conditions set
forth therein, to be available at Closing, including by using its best efforts
to (i) maintain in effect the Commitment Letter and, if entered into prior to
the Closing, the definitive documentation with respect to the Financing
contemplated by the Commitment Letter; (ii) satisfy on a timely basis all
conditions applicable to the Buyer in the Commitment Letter that are within
its control and comply with its obligations thereunder and not take or fail to
take any action that would be reasonably expected to prevent or impede or
delay the availability of the Financing; and (iii) enforce its rights under
the Commitment Letter in the event of a breach by the Financing source that
impedes or delays the Closing, including by seeking specific performance of
the parties thereunder if necessary, unless the Buyer reasonably concludes
that seeking specific performance is impracticable or not reasonably likely to
succeed under such circumstances. In the event that all conditions to the
Financing have been satisfied, the Buyer shall use its best efforts to cause
the lenders and the other Persons providing such Financing to fund such
Financing on the Closing Date. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
herein, if the Financing in the amount set forth in the Commitment Letter
becomes unavailable to the Buyer on the terms and conditions set forth
therein, the Buyer shall use its reasonable best efforts to obtain such funds
to the extent available on material terms and conditions no less favorable in
the aggregate to the Buyer than as set forth in the Commitment Letter (the
"Alternate Financing"). For purposes of this Agreement, "reasonable best
efforts" or any substantially similar undertakings shall not require Buyer to
(i) pay (or agree to pay) more for the Financing or the Alternate Financing
(whether in interest rate, fees or otherwise) than the terms set forth in the
Commitment Letter, or (ii) waive any condition or agree to any changes to the
Commitment Letter.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

55  

  

 

 

 

  

  

(b) The Seller shall provide such cooperation and assistance as the Buyer
reasonably requests in connection with the arrangement of the Financing
contemplated by the Commitment Letter or any Alternate Financing, including
(to the extent that such activities do not unreasonably interfere with the
business or operations of the Seller):

  

  

(i) participation by appropriate senior management of the Seller in a
reasonable number of meetings, due diligence sessions, drafting sessions and
sessions with rating agencies and prospective lenders;

  

  

(ii) assisting Buyer with the preparation of customary rating agency
presentations, marketing materials and information memoranda (including the
delivery of one or more customary representation and authorization letters) as
may be required in connection with the Financing;

  

  

(iii) facilitating the pledging and mortgaging of collateral, including
assisting with the preparation of security documents, other definitive
financing documents, and other certificates or documents and back-up therefor
as may be reasonably requested by the Financing sources provided that no
obligation or agreement of the Seller under any agreement, document or pledge
related to the Financing shall be operative until the Closing and no release
or termination of any Lien shall be effective until the Closing and only in
accordance with the applicable payoff documents;

  

  

(iv) furnishing Buyer, as promptly as practicable, with such financial and
other pertinent information relating to the Seller or the Purchased Assets as
may be reasonably required by the Financing sources, and using reasonable best
efforts to obtain customary comfort letters and consents from independent
public accountants (provided that the Seller shall not be required to prepare
or furnish any financial statements other than the Financial Statements, and
provided, further, that the Buyer shall be responsible for the preparation of
pro forma financial statements);

  

  

(v) assisting in the negotiation of definitive documents for the Financing as
may be reasonably requested by the Buyer, to become effective on the Closing;

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

56  

  

 

 

 

  

  

(vi) delivering notices of prepayment within the time periods required by the
relevant agreements governing the Seller's indebtedness, to become effective
only upon the Closing, and obtaining customary consents payoff letters, lien
terminations and instruments of discharge to be delivered at and effective
only on the Closing, to allow for the payoff, discharge and termination in
full at the Closing of such indebtedness as is required to be repaid,
discharged or terminated pursuant to the definitive documents for the
Financing; and

  

  

(vii) promptly and in any event at least three (3) Business Days prior to the
Closing Date, furnishing Buyer with all documentation and other information
(to the extent reasonably requested by the Financing sources at least ten (10)
Business Days prior to the Closing Date) that is required by regulatory
authorities pursuant to applicable "know your customer" and anti-money
laundering rules and regulations, including the Patriot Act.

  

  

(c) Nothing in this Section 6.13 shall require the Seller to (i) waive or
amend any terms of this Agreement; (ii) take any action that could be expected
to result in a breach of a Material Contract; (iii) take any action that would
reasonably be expected to subject it to any actual liability or require it to
pay or reimburse any fees or expenses for which it would not be entitled to
reimbursement pursuant to Section 6.13(e) or is not otherwise indemnified by
or on behalf of Buyer, or to give any indemnities that are effective prior to
the Closing; or (iv) obtain approval of its board of directors or similar
governing body for any resolutions or authorizations relating to the
Financing.

  

  

(d) All non-public or other confidential information provided by Seller or any
of its Representatives pursuant to this Agreement shall be kept confidential
in accordance with the Confidentiality Agreement; provided, however that Buyer
shall be permitted to disclose such information to any financing sources or
prospective financing sources and other financial institutions that are or may
become parties to the Financing or the Alternate Financing (and to their
respective counsel and auditors) so long as such Persons obtain the prior
written consent of the Seller prior to receiving any such information and (i)
agree to be bound by the Confidentiality Agreement as if parties thereto; or
(ii) are subject to other customary confidentiality undertakings reasonably
satisfactory to the Seller (it being acknowledged and agreed that the notices
and undertakings in a form customarily used in confidential information
memoranda for senior credit facilities or mezzanine facilities are reasonably
satisfactory to the Seller).

  

  

(e) Promptly upon request by the Seller, the Buyer shall reimburse the Seller
(or pay in advance) for any reasonable and documented out-of-pocket costs and
expenses (including outside attorneys' fees) incurred by the Seller in
connection with the cooperation of the Seller contemplated by this Section
6.13.

  

  

Section 6.14 Rule 144.

  

  

(a) The Seller and the Seller Designees have acknowledged that the Buyer
Shares being issued as Stock Consideration are "restricted securities" as
defined in Rule 144 promulgated under the Securities Act and will be subject
to a lock-up period of six (6) months. The Buyer Shares may not be
transferred, resold, pledged, hypothecated or otherwise disposed of in the
absence of a legal opinion of counsel reasonably acceptable to the Buyer that
such transfer may be made without registration under the Securities Act and
all applicable state securities or blue sky laws.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

57  

  

 

 

 

  

  

(b) With a view to making available to the Seller and the Seller Designee(s)
the benefits of Rule 144 promulgated under the Securities Act and any other
similar rule or regulation of the SEC that may at any time permit the Seller
Designee(s) to sell securities of the Buyer to the public without
registration, the Buyer agrees to use commercially reasonable efforts to:

  

  

(i) make and keep adequate current public information available, as those
terms are understood and defined in Rule 144;

  

  

(ii) file with the SEC in a timely manner all reports and other documents
required of the Buyer under the Securities Act and the Exchange Act, for so
long as the Buyer remains subject to such requirements, and the filing of such
reports and other documents as is required for sales under Rule 144;

  

  

(iii) submit electronically and post on its corporate web site, if any, every
interactive data file required to be submitted and posted pursuant to Rule 405
of Regulation S-T; and

  

  

(iv) furnish to the Seller and any of the Seller Designees, promptly upon
written request, (A) to the extent accurate, a written statement by Buyer that
it has complied with the reporting requirements of Rule 144, the Securities
Act and the Exchange Act and (B) such other information as may be reasonably
requested to permit the Seller Designees to sell such securities pursuant to
Rule 144 without registration.

  

  

(c) Provided the Seller Designee or the Seller, as applicable meets the
requirements of Rule 144 as heretofore referenced, the Buyer shall promptly,
upon the Seller or a Seller Designee's written request, provide instructions
to its stock transfer agent to remove the restrictive legend from any stock
certificate representing the Seller or the Seller Designee's portion of the
Stock Consideration. The Seller or the Seller Designee, as applicable, shall
provide Buyer with the customary written certificates necessary for Buyer to
satisfy the foregoing requirement.

  

  

Section 6.15 RandW Insurance Policy. Prior to the Closing, the Buyer shall use
its reasonable best efforts to cause AIG Specialty Insurance Company (the
"Insurer") to effectuate the Buyer-Side Representations and Warranty Insurance
policy, bound by the Insurer on the date hereof, having terms and conditions
as set forth in the Binder Agreement dated January 5, 2016 and attached hereto
as Exhibit F, with policy number 64738466 (as may be amended, modified or
supplemented from time to time in accordance with this Agreement) (the "RandW
Insurance Policy"), it being acknowledged and agreed that any amendments,
modifications or supplements to, or waivers under, the RandW Insurance Policy
that are material to Seller's indemnification obligations set forth in Article
X shall require the prior written consent of the Seller, such consent not to
be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

58  

  

 

 

 

  

  

Section 6.16 Noncompetition.

  

  

(a) Without the prior written consent of the Buyer, the Seller shall not
directly or indirectly (whether through any partnership of which it is a
member, through any trust in which it is a beneficiary or trustee or through a
corporation or other entity in which it has any interest, legal or equitable,
or in any other capacity whatsoever) until the date which is the three (3)
year anniversary of the Closing Date, invest, engage or participate or plan or
prepare to invest, engage or participate in a Competing Business in North
America or any nation, state, territory or location where the Seller has
conducted the Business within the past three (3) years. Notwithstanding the
restrictions contained in this Section 6.16(a), no Person shall be prohibited
from acquiring or holding an interest of less than 5% of the outstanding
equity securities of any Competing Business whose equity securities are listed
on a national securities exchange, quoted on the national or capital markets
or traded in the over-the-counter bulletin board.

  

  

(b) Without the prior written consent of the Buyer, the Seller shall not until
the date which is the three (3) year anniversary of the Closing Date, solicit,
divert or take away or attempt to divert or take away the business or
patronage of any of the clients, customers or suppliers of the Business to any
individual, partnership, firm, business, corporation or other entity engaged
in or planning or preparing to engage in a Competing Business.

  

  

(c) Without the prior written consent of the Buyer, Seller shall procure that
Cerberus Capital Management, L.P., a Delaware limited partnership ("Cerberus")
and each Affiliate of Cerberus that provides investment management and/or
administrative services to privately-placed pooled investment vehicles (the
"Management Company Affiliates," and together with Cerberus, the "Cerberus
Group") not to, and no member of the Cerberus Group shall, act in concert with
the Seller or any other Person to, until the date which is the three (3) year
anniversary of the Closing Date, solicit, divert or take away or attempt to
divert or take away the business patronage of any of the clients, customers,
or suppliers of the Business to any individual, partnership, firm, business,
corporation or other entity in or planning or preparing to engage in a
Competing Business; provided that, this Section 6.16(c) shall not prohibit any
such action by any portfolio company that is controlled by any member of the
Cerberus Group so long as such portfolio company is not acting in concert with
any member of the Cerberus Group to circumvent this Section 6.16(c).

  

  

(d) The Seller agrees that the duration and area for which the covenant not to
compete set forth in Section 6.16(a) is to be effective is reasonable. In the
event that any court determines that the time period or the area or both of
them are unreasonable and such covenant is to that extent unenforceable, the
Seller agrees that the covenant shall remain in full force and effect for the
greatest time period and in the greatest area that would not render it
unenforceable. The Seller agrees that damages are an inadequate remedy for any
breach of this covenant and that Buyer shall, whether or not it is pursuing
any potential remedies at law, be entitled to equitable relief in the form of
preliminary and permanent injunctions without bond or other security upon any
actual or threatened breach of this covenant. No waiver of any breach of the
foregoing covenant shall be implied from the forbearance or failure of Buyer
to take action thereon. The Seller acknowledges and agrees that the sale of
the Purchased Assets contemplated hereby includes the sale of goodwill in the
Seller and the consideration to be paid pursuant to this Agreement for this
covenant not to compete is adequate.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

59  

  

 

 

 

  

  

(e) The Seller covenants and agrees with Buyer that it will not at any time,
except in performance of its obligations to Buyer, directly or indirectly,
use, disclose or publish, or permit other Persons (including Affiliates of the
Seller) to disclose or publish, any confidential information with respect to
the Business, excluding information to the extent relating to the Excluded
Assets or the Excluded Liabilities, or use any such information in a manner
detrimental to the interests of Buyer or any of its Affiliates, unless (i)
such information becomes generally known to the public through no fault of the
Seller or its Affiliates, (ii) the disclosing party is advised in writing by
counsel that disclosure is required by Law or the order of any Governmental
Authority of competent jurisdiction under applicable Law, or (iii) the
disclosing party reasonably believes that such disclosure is required in
connection with a subpoena served upon or in the defense of a lawsuit against
the disclosing party; provided that prior to disclosing any information
pursuant to clauses (ii) and (iii) above, such Person shall give prior written
notice thereof to Buyer and provide Buyer with the opportunity to contest such
disclosure and shall cooperate with efforts to prevent such disclosure.

  

  

Section 6.17 No Shop. From the date hereof until the Closing or the earlier
termination of this Agreement, neither the Seller or any of its Affiliates,
directors, officers, employees and legal and financial advisors shall: (a)
initiate, solicit, entertain, negotiate, accept, discuss or knowingly
encourage, directly or indirectly, any proposal or offer (an "Acquisition
Proposal") by any person or entity (other than Buyer) regarding (i) the sale
or license of all or any material assets of the Seller or the Business, (ii)
any sale, merger, consolidation, liquidation, dissolution, public offering,
recapitalization, issuance of securities or similar transaction involving the
Seller or the Business, or (iii) the issuance or transfer of any equity of the
Seller (each of the actions referred to in the immediately preceding clauses
(i) through (iii), a "Third Party Acquisition"), (b) except as otherwise
required by Law or in the ordinary course of business, provide any non-public
financial or other confidential or proprietary information regarding the
Seller or the Business to any person or entity (other than Buyer or its
Representatives), (c) take any other action with the purpose of facilitating
any inquiries or the making of any proposal that constitutes, or would
reasonably be expected to result in, a Third Party Acquisition, (d) enter into
any written or oral agreement, arrangement or understanding requiring the
Seller to abandon, terminate or fail to consummate the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, or (e) enter into any written or oral
agreement or understanding with any Person (other than Buyer) authorizing a
Third Party Acquisition. The Seller agrees to promptly, and in any event
within two (2) Business Days following receipt, notify Buyer if the Seller or,
to the Knowledge of the Seller, any of their respective Representatives
receives any indications of interest, requests for information or offers in
respect of an Acquisition Proposal.

  

  

Section 6.18 Maintenance of Existence. The Seller shall remain in existence
and in good standing in the Commonwealth of Virginia for at least eighteen
(18) months following the Closing Date, during which time the Seller shall not
file for dissolution. Seller shall not be prevented from making dividends or
distributions to its shareholders or creditors, including distributions of the
Purchase Price; provided that such distributions are in accordance with
applicable Law and this Agreement. Following the Closing, the Buyer shall make
reasonably available to the Seller the Key Employees then-employed by the
Buyer for the purposes of dissolving or otherwise winding up the Seller and
assisting the Seller with performance of its obligations under this Agreement.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

60  

  

 

 

 

  

  

Section 6.19 Name Changes. Within 30 days after the Closing Date, the Seller
shall take any and all actions or cause to be taken such actions to amend its
name to remove "Home Meridian" and any and all derivations thereof, including,
without limitation, making any and all required filings with Governmental
Authorities.

  

  

Section 6.20 No Hunt. Buyer shall not, and shall not allow its Subsidiaries or
Affiliates to, permit any subsurface sampling, analysis or investigation of
any Leased Real Property by or on behalf of Buyer (or an Affiliate or
Subsidiary of Buyer) after the Closing Date unless such sampling, analysis, or
investigation is: (1) required by any Environmental Law; (2) in response to a
request of a Governmental Authority pursuant to its authority under
Environmental Law; (3) conducted in response to an Environmental Claim; or (4)
in response to a reasonable due diligence request from the owners of such
Leased Real Property.

  

  

Section 6.21 Further Agreements.

  

  

(a) The Seller authorizes and empowers the Buyer from and after the Closing
Date to receive and to open all mail or other communications addressed to the
Seller and received by the Buyer, in order to determine whether or not such
mail relates to the Purchased Assets or the Assumed Liabilities. The Buyer
shall deal with the contents of all such communications in accordance with the
provisions of this Section 6.21. The Buyer shall promptly deliver to the
Seller any mail or other communication received by it after the Closing Date
that relates solely to Excluded Assets or Excluded Liabilities and/or that
does not relate to the Purchased Assets or the Assumed Liabilities (or copies
thereof, to the extent it relates to the Purchased Assets or the Assumed
Liabilities, but also relates to Excluded Assets or Excluded Liabilities).
Seller agrees that Buyer has the right and authority to endorse, without
recourse, any check or other evidence of indebtedness received by Buyer in
respect of any note or account receivable transferred to Buyer pursuant to
this Agreement and Seller shall furnish such evidence of this authority as the
Buyer may reasonably request; provided, that the foregoing authority is
without prejudice to any rights the Seller may have with respect to any check
or other evidence of indebtedness, to the extent it does not relate to the
Purchased Assets or the Assumed Liabilities. Cash payments addressed to
Seller, or checks payable to Seller, in each case, that do not constitute or
do not relate to a Purchased Asset or an Assumed Liability, shall be forwarded
to the Seller by the Buyer.

  

  

(b) To the extent that the Seller receives any cash, check, electronic credit
or deposit that constitutes a Purchased Asset, Seller shall promptly wire
transfer the appropriate amount in immediately available funds to the Buyer.

  

  

(c) The Buyer shall promptly deliver to the Seller any mail or other
communication addressed to the Buyer and received by it after the Closing Date
that relates to the Excluded Assets or the Excluded Liabilities. In addition,
to the extent that the Buyer receives any cash, check, electronic credit or
deposit that constitutes an Excluded Asset, the Buyer shall promptly wire
transfer the appropriate amount in immediately available funds to the Seller.

portion of the total of any stamp, documentary, registration, sales, use,
transfer, added value or other non-Income Tax imposed under applicable Law in

connection with Transfer Taxes.

  

  

Section 7.2 Tax Adjustments. Taxes (other than Transfer Taxes or Income Taxes)
imposed upon or assessed directly against the Purchased Assets for the Tax
period in which the Closing occurs (the "Proration Period") will be
apportioned and prorated between the Seller on the one hand and the Buyer on
the other hand as of the Closing Date with the Buyer bearing the expense of
the Buyer's proportionate share of such Taxes, which shall be equal to the
product obtained by multiplying (a) a fraction, the numerator being the number
of days in the Proration Period following the Closing Date and the denominator
being the total number of days in the Proration Period, by (b) the amount of
such Taxes, and the Seller shall bear the remaining portion of such Taxes. If
the precise amount of any such Tax cannot be ascertained on the Closing Date,
apportionment and proration shall be computed on the basis of the amount
payable for each respective item during the Tax period immediately preceding
the Proration Period and any proration shall be adjusted thereafter on the
basis of the actual charges for such items in the Proration Period. Within ten
(10) days after receipt of a refund of any Taxes that were subject to
proration under this Section 7.2, the Party that receives any such refund
shall remit to the other Party its share, if any, of such refund, with each
Party's share to be calculated on the same basis as provided above.

Outside Date shall automatically be extended to coincide with the end of such
30-day period), and upon mutual agreement of the Parties, if any, the
condition set forth in this Section 8.2(a) shall be deemed to be satisfied; or
(iii) greater than or equal to $5,000,000, then the condition set forth in

TERMINATION

  

  

Section 9.1 Termination. This Agreement may be terminated at any time prior to
the Closing:

  

  

(a) by mutual written consent of the Parties; or

  

  

(b) by either the Buyer or the Seller:

  

  

(i) if the transactions contemplated under this Agreement are not consummated
on or before June 1, 2016 (the "Outside Date") as may be automatically
extended pursuant to Section 8.2(a)(ii), unless the failure to consummate the
transactions is the result of a breach of this Agreement by the party seeking
to terminate this Agreement; or

  

  

(ii) if any condition to the obligation of such party to consummate the
transactions contemplated under this Agreement set forth in Section 8.1 (in
the case of each party hereto), Section 8.2 (in the case of the Buyer), or
Section 8.3 (in the case of the Seller) becomes incapable of satisfaction
prior to the Outside Date; provided that such termination shall not be
available to any Party whose failure to comply with or perform any
representation, warranty or covenant contained in this Agreement has been the
primary cause of such incapability to satisfy such condition; provided,
further, if the Seller negotiates in good faith for a period of 30 days
pursuant to Section 8.2(a)(ii) and the Parties fail to reach a mutual
agreement, then the Seller shall have the right to terminate this Agreement;
provided, further, for the avoidance of doubt, if Section 8.2(a)(iii) applies,
then the Seller shall also have the right to terminate this Agreement.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

64  

  

 

 

 

  

  

(c) by the Buyer, if the Seller breaches or fails to perform any of its
representations, warranties or covenants contained in this Agreement, which
breach or failure to perform (i) would give rise to the failure of a condition
set forth in Section 8.2 and (ii) cannot be or has not been cured within
thirty (30) days after the giving of written notice to the Seller of such
breach; provided that the Buyer is not then in breach of any representation,
warranty, covenant or agreement contained in this Agreement; or

  

  

(d) by the Seller, if the Buyer breaches or fails to perform any of any of its
representations, warranties or covenants contained in this Agreement, which
breach or failure to perform (i) would give rise to the failure of a condition
set forth in Section 8.3 and (ii) cannot be or has not been cured within
thirty (30) days after the giving of written notice to the Buyer of such
breach; provided that the Seller is not then in breach of any representation,
warranty, covenant or agreement in this Agreement.

  

  

Section 9.2 Effect of Termination.

  

  

(a) If this Agreement is terminated for any reason, the provisions of Section
6.3 (Access to Information; Confidentiality), Section 6.6(a) (Antitrust
Notifications), Section 6.8 (Public Announcements), Section 6.9 (Fees and
Expenses), Article XI (General Provisions) and this Section 9.2 shall remain
in full force and effect.

  

  

(b) If this Agreement is terminated as provided in Section 9.1, this Agreement
shall forthwith become void (except to the extent provided in Section 9.2(a)
above) and there shall be no liability or obligation under this Agreement on
the part of any Party to this Agreement or their respective Representatives;
provided, however, (a) that the provisions of Section 6.9 shall survive the
termination of this Agreement and (b) termination of this Agreement shall not
relieve any Party of any liability for any breach occurring prior to such
termination.

  

  

(c) Buyer Termination Fee.

  

  

(i) If this Agreement is terminated by the Buyer or the Seller as provided in
Section 9.1(b) at a time when all conditions set forth in Section 8.1 and
Section 8.2 have been satisfied, except for (A) conditions that by their
nature are only capable of being satisfied at Closing, and (B) the condition
set forth in Section 8.2(d), or by the Seller as provided Section 9.1(d) as
the result of the Buyer's material breach of its obligations pursuant to
Section 6.13 and provided that the Seller is not in material breach of its
obligations pursuant to Section 6.13, the Parties agree that the Seller shall
have suffered a loss of value to their assets of an incalculable nature and
amount, unrecoverable in law, and the Buyer shall pay to the Seller a fee of
$1,000,000 (the "Buyer Termination Fee") as liquidated damages, and not as a
penalty, it being understood that (x) in no event shall Buyer be required to
pay the Buyer Termination Fee on more than one occasion and (y) under no
circumstances shall the Seller be permitted or entitled to receive both a
grant of specific performance that results in a Closing and any money damages
for a breach of Section 6.13, including all or any portion of the Buyer
Termination Fee. The Buyer Termination Fee shall be payable in immediately
available funds by wire transfer to an account designated by the Seller no
later than five (5) Business Days after such termination. The Parties agree
that the agreements contained in this Section 9.2(c) are an integral part of
the transactions contemplated under this Agreement and without these
agreements, the Seller would not have entered into this Agreement.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

65  

  

 

 

 

  

  

(ii) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, the Seller's
right to receive payment of the Buyer Termination Fee pursuant to this Section
9.2(c) shall be the sole and exclusive remedy of the Seller against the Buyer
or any of its Affiliates or any of their respective stockholders, partners,
members or Representatives for any and all losses that may be suffered based
upon, resulting from or arising out of the circumstances giving rise to such
termination, and upon payment of the Buyer Termination Fee in accordance with
this Section 9.2(c), none of the Buyer or any of its Affiliates or any of
their respective stockholders, partners, members or Representatives shall have
any further liability or obligation relating to or arising out of this
Agreement or the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

  

  

(d) Subject to Section 9.2(c), if this Agreement is terminated as provided in
subsections (b), (c) or (d) of Section 9.1, such termination shall be without
prejudice to any rights that the terminating party may have against any
breaching party or any other Person under the terms of this Agreement or
otherwise.

INDEMNIFICATION; RandW INSURANCE

  

  

Section 10.1 Survival.

  

  

(a) The representations and warranties contained in this Agreement shall
survive the Closing Date and continue in full force and effect for eighteen
(18) months after the Closing Date and shall thereafter be of no further force
or effect; provided that the representations and warranties contained in (i)
Section 4.1 (Organization and Qualification; Subsidiaries), Section 4.3
(Authority), Section 4.10 (Title to Assets), Section 4.15 (with respect to
title and ownership only) (Intellectual Property) and Section 4.19 (Brokers)
(collectively, the "Seller Fundamental Representations") and (ii) Section 5.1
(Organization and Qualification), Section 5.3 (Authority) and Section 5.6
(Brokers) (collectively, the "Buyer Fundamental Representations") shall
survive the Closing indefinitely unless a statute of limitations applies to
claims of third parties in any such case, and with respect to such claims,
such representations and warranties shall expire sixty (60) days following the
expiration of the applicable statute of limitations (including any extensions
thereof) provided by applicable Law.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

66  

  

 

 

 

  

  

(b) The covenants and agreements of each party contained in this Agreement
shall survive the Closing in accordance with their terms until the expiration
of the applicable statute of limitations; provided that any and all covenants
or agreements of any party relating to any period prior to the Closing shall
not survive the Closing and shall thereafter be of no further force or effect.

  

  

(c) No Indemnification Claim relating to the representations, warranties,
covenants and agreements contained in this Agreement may be asserted pursuant
to this Agreement unless (i) in the case of representations and warranties,
notice of such Indemnification Claim is delivered pursuant to Section 10.4
prior to the date of expiration of such representation or warranty and (ii) in
the case of representations, warranties, covenants and agreements, such
Indemnification Claim is made in respect of Losses incurred prior to the date
of expiration of such representation or warranty or such statute of
limitations, as applicable. Notwithstanding the foregoing, any claims asserted
in good faith with reasonable specificity (to the extent known at such time)
and in writing by notice from the non-breaching party to the breaching party
prior to the expiration date of the applicable survival period shall not
thereafter be barred by the expiration of the relevant representation or
warranty or such statute of limitations, as applicable, and such claims shall
survive until finally resolved. For the avoidance of doubt, the Parties hereby
agree and acknowledge that the survival periods set forth in this Section 10.1
are contractual statutes of limitations.

  

  

Section 10.2 Indemnification.

  

  

(a) Subject to limitations set forth in this Article X, the Buyer shall
indemnify, defend and hold harmless the Seller and its Affiliates, officers,
directors, employees, agents, representatives, successors and assigns (the
"Seller Indemnified Parties") for any and all Losses to the extent
attributable to (i) the failure of any representation or warranty the Buyer
has made in Article V of this Agreement to be true and correct as of the date
made and on the Closing Date, (ii) any breach by the Buyer of any post-Closing
covenant or agreement of the Buyer in this Agreement, or (iii) any Assumed
Liability following Closing (collectively, the claims made under this section,
"Seller Claims").

  

  

(b) Subject to limitations set forth in this Article X, the Seller shall
indemnify, defend and hold harmless the Buyer, its Affiliates, and its
officers, directors, employees, agents, representatives, successors and
assigns (the "Buyer Indemnified Parties") for any and all (i) Warranty Losses
to the extent attributable to the failure of any representation or warranty
the Seller has made in Article IV of this Agreement to be true and correct as
of the date made and on the Closing Date, (ii) Losses to the extent
attributable to any breach by the Seller of any post-Closing covenant or
agreement of the Seller in this Agreement or (iii) Losses to the extent
attributable to any Excluded Liability (collectively, the claims made under
this section, "Buyer Claims", and, together with the Seller Claims, the
"Indemnification Claims").

  

  

Section 10.3 Limitations.

  

  

(a) Seller's Limitations. Subject to Section 10.3(c), the Seller shall not
indemnify the Buyer Indemnified Parties, and the Buyer Indemnified Parties
shall not be entitled to recover any amount for any Buyer Claims under Section
10.2(b)(i), until and unless the amount which the Buyer Indemnified Parties
are entitled to recover in respect of such Buyer Claims exceeds, in the
aggregate, $500,000 (the "Seller Deductible"), in which event the Buyer
Indemnified Parties shall be entitled to recover the lesser of (i) $500,000
and (ii) the amount of such Buyer Claims in excess of the Seller Deductible up
to the then-current amount of insurance retention under the RandW Insurance
Policy (the "Seller Cap").

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

67  

  

 

 

 

  

  

(b) RandW Insurance Policy; Escrow Fund. From and after the Closing, any claims
or indemnification under Section 10.2(b)(i) shall be satisfied (i) first, by
application toward the Seller Deductible (subject to Section 10.3(c) in the
case of the failure of Seller Fundamental Representations to be true and
correct as of the date made and at the Closing), (ii) second, by Seller
provided that to the extent recovery is available under the Escrow Fund,
pursuant to the Escrow Agreement, up to the Seller Cap and (iii) thereafter,
by recovery under the RandW Insurance Policy (subject to Section 10.3(c) in the
case of the failure of Seller Fundamental Representations to be true and
correct as of the date made and at the Closing).

  

  

(c) Excluded Liabilities and Other Exceptions. Notwithstanding anything in
this Article X to the contrary the Seller Deductible and the Seller Cap shall
not apply to any Losses or Warranty Losses to the extent such Losses or
Warranty Losses: (A) are attributable to Excluded Liabilities; (B) arise from
the failure of any of the Seller Fundamental Representations to be true and
correct as of the date made and at the Closing; (C) arise from a post-Closing
breach by the Seller of any covenants contained in this Agreement that by
their nature survive the Closing; or (D) are attributable to fraud or
intentional misrepresentation.

  

  

(d) No Hunt. Seller shall not indemnify the Buyer Indemnified Parties, and the
Buyer Indemnified Parties shall not be entitled to recover any amount for any
Buyer Claims under Section 10.2(b) arising from any subsurface sampling,
analysis or investigation by or on behalf of Buyer after the Closing Date
unless such sampling, analysis, or investigation is: (1) required by any
Environmental Law; (2) in response to a request of a Governmental Authority
pursuant to its authority under Environmental Law; (3) conducted in response
to an Environmental Claim; or (4) in response to a reasonable due diligence
request from the owners of such Leased Real Property.

  

  

Section 10.4 Claims Procedures. Except with respect to Third Party Claims
covered by Section 10.5, the party to this Agreement who wishes to make a
Indemnification Claim for Losses pursuant to this Article X (an "Indemnified
Party") shall give written notice to the Seller or the Buyer, as applicable
(the "Indemnitor"), promptly, and in any event no later than thirty (30) days
after it acquires knowledge of the fact, event or circumstances giving rise to
the claim for the Losses, but the failure of any Indemnified Party to give
notice as provided in this Section 10.4 shall not relieve the Indemnitor of
its obligations under this Article X, except to the extent that such
Indemnitor is materially prejudiced by such failure to give notice. Such
written notice shall specify in reasonable detail the factual basis of such
claim, state the amount of Losses (or if not known, a good faith estimate of
the amount of Losses) and the method of computation thereof and contain a
reference to the provision of this Agreement in respect of which such claim
arises. Promptly after written notice of a claim has been provided as set
forth above (and in no event later than thirty (30) days after the Indemnified
Party acquires knowledge of the fact, event or circumstances giving rise to a
claim for Losses), the Indemnified Party shall supply the Indemnitor with such
information and documents as it has in its possession regarding such claim,
together with all pertinent information in its possession regarding the amount
of the Losses that it asserts it has sustained or incurred, and will permit
the Indemnitor to inspect such other records and books in the possession of
the Indemnified Party, and will allow reasonable access, to relevant
personnel, auditors and other Representatives (subject to customary exceptions
for legal privilege), in each case relating to the claim and asserted Losses
as the Indemnitor shall reasonably request. The Indemnitor shall have a period
of thirty (30) days after receipt by the Indemnitor of such notice and such
evidence to either (i) agree to the payment of the Losses to the Indemnified
Party or (ii) contest the payment of the Losses. If the Indemnitor does not
agree to or contests the payment of the Losses within such 30-day period, then
the Indemnitor shall be deemed not to have accepted the Losses and the Parties
shall negotiate in good faith to seek a resolution of such dispute. If the
Indemnitor agrees to the payment of the Losses within such 30-day period in
accordance with the second preceding sentence, then it shall, within ten (10)
Business Days after such agreement, pay to the Indemnified Party the amount of
the Losses that is payable pursuant to, and subject to the limitations set
forth in, this Article X.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

68  

  

 

 

 

  

  

Section 10.5 Third Party Claims.

  

  

(a) If any claim or action at law or suit in equity is instituted by a third
party against a Covered Party (each, a "Third Party Claim") with respect to
which a Covered Party intends to claim indemnification for any Losses under
Section 10.2(b) or recovery under the RandW Insurance Policy, as the case may
be, then such Covered Party shall give written notice to the Indemnitor or, in
the case of a claim under the RandW Insurance Policy, the Seller (as the case
may be, the "Responsible Party"), promptly, and in any event no later than
thirty (30) days after it has knowledge of a written assertion of liability
from the Third Party, and shall not make any admissions or acceptances, but
the failure of any Covered Party to give notice as provided in this Section
10.5 shall not relieve the Responsible Party of its obligations under Section
10.2(b), except to the extent that such Responsible Party is materially
prejudiced by such failure to give notice. Such written notice shall specify
in reasonable detail the factual basis of such claim, state the amount of
Losses (or if not known, a good faith estimate of the amount of Losses) and
the method of computation thereof, and contain a reference to the provision of
this Agreement in respect of which such claim arises. The Covered Party shall
supply the Responsible Party and at such Responsible Party's election, its
Representatives, agents or assigns, with such information and documents as it
has in its possession regarding such claim, and will allow reasonable access
to relevant personnel, auditors and other Representatives of the Covered Party
(subject to customary exceptions for legal privilege) together with all
pertinent information in its possession regarding the amount of the Loss that
it asserts it has sustained or incurred, and will permit the Responsible Party
(as well as such Responsible Party's Representatives, agents, or assigns) to
inspect such other records and books in the possession of the Covered Party
and relating to the Third Party Claim and asserted Loss as the Responsible
Party shall reasonably request, and the Covered Party shall cooperate with the
Responsible Party with respect to matters relating to any Third Party Claims.

  

  

(b) The Responsible Party shall have the right to conduct and control, at its
own expense, through counsel of its choosing, the defense of a Third Party
Claim so long as the Responsible Party notifies the Covered Party that it has
agreed to indemnify the Covered Party (subject to the limitations on
indemnification set forth herein) for, or has confirmed that the RandW Insurance
Policy covers, any and all Losses arising out of or resulting from the Third
Party Claim of which it is assuming the right to conduct and control the
defense within fifteen (15) Business Days of its receipt of the initial notice
of the Third Party Claim, and shall do so in good faith; provided that the
Covered Party may participate at its own expense, with counsel of its
choosing, in the defense of such third-party action or suit although such
action or suit shall be controlled by the Responsible Party. The party
defending such action or suit shall in any event defend any such matters
vigorously and in good faith.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

69  

  

 

 

 

  

  

(c) The Covered Party and the Responsible Party shall in any case cooperate
with each other to the fullest extent possible in regard to all matters
relating to the Third Party Claim, including corrective actions required by
applicable Law, assertion of defenses, the determination, mitigation,
negotiation and settlement of all amounts, costs, actions, penalties, damages
and the like related thereto, access to the books and records of the Seller
and its Subsidiaries and, if necessary, providing the party controlling the
defense of the Third Party Claim and its counsel with any powers of attorney
or other documents required to permit the party controlling the defense of the
Third Party Claim and its counsel to act on behalf of the other party.

  

  

(d) Neither the Covered Party nor the Responsible Party shall settle any Third
Party Claim without the consent of the other party, which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed; provided that if such
settlement involves the payment of money only and the release of the Third
Party Claim and the Covered Party is completely indemnified therefor and
nonetheless refuses to consent to such settlement, then the Responsible Party
shall cease to be obligated for such Third Party Claim. Any compromise or
settlement of the Third Party Claim under this Section 10.5 shall include as
an unconditional and irrevocable term thereof the giving by the claimant in
question to the Indemnitor and the Indemnified Party a full and final release
of all liabilities in respect of such claims.

  

  

Section 10.6 Tax Treatment of Indemnity Payment. For all Tax purposes, the
Buyer and the Seller agree to treat any indemnity payment made by an
Indemnitor pursuant to this Article X as an adjustment to the Purchase Price,
unless otherwise required by Law.

  

  

Section 10.7 Determination of Losses.

  

  

(a) The Parties hereby agree that for the purposes of determining whether a
representation or warranty is inaccurate and a breach has occurred, as well as
in determining the amount of Warranty Losses that may be recovered for an
Indemnification Claim under Section 10.2(b)(i), each such representation and
warranty in this Agreement shall be read without regard, and without giving
effect to, the term "material," "Material Adverse Effect" or terms of similar
import (fully as if any such word or phrase were deleted from such
representation or warranty); provided, however, that this Section 10.7(a)
shall not apply to any closing condition set forth in Section 8.2(a).

  

  

(b) In calculating the amounts payable to an Indemnified Party (including, for
the avoidance of doubt, the calculation of the Seller Deductible), the amount
of any indemnified Losses shall be determined without duplication of any other
Loss for which an Indemnification Claim has been made or could be made under
any other representation, warranty, covenant or agreement, and shall be
computed net of (i) payments recoverable by the Indemnified Party under any
insurance policy (other than the RandW Insurance Policy), with respect to such
Losses or pursuant to any contribution rights; and (ii) any prior or
subsequent recovery by the Indemnified Party from any Person with respect to
such Losses (including pursuant to any indemnification agreement or
arrangement with any Third Party).

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

70  

  

 

 

 

  

  

(c) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, in no event shall
any Indemnified Party be entitled to indemnification to the extent any Losses
were solely attributable to such Indemnified Party's own gross negligence or
willful misconduct. In respect of any Loss for which indemnification may be
sought pursuant to this Article X, the Indemnified Party shall (i) take
reasonable steps to mitigate any Losses upon becoming aware of any event which
would reasonably be expected to, or does, give rise thereto; and (ii) use
reasonable efforts to pursue all legal rights and remedies available
(including insurance recoveries and third-party indemnification) in order to
minimize the Losses to which it may be entitled to indemnification under this
Agreement. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, in no
event shall any Indemnified Party be required to (i) engage counsel or file
suit in connection with any claim under any insurance policies (including the
RandW Insurance Policy) or third party indemnity, contribution or other similar
agreements, (ii) make any claim against any material customer, material
supplier or other material business relationship or their respective
Affiliates or (iii) mitigate any Losses in excess of those required by
applicable law with respect to a breach of contract claim.

  

  

Section 10.8 Payments. Once a Loss is agreed to by the Indemnitor or finally
adjudicated to be payable pursuant to this Article X, the Indemnitor shall
satisfy its obligations within fifteen (15) Business Days of such final, non-
appealable adjudication by wire transfer of immediately available funds. The
Parties agree that should an Indemnitor not make full payment of any such
obligations within such fifteen (15) Business Day period, the amount payable
shall accrue interest from and including the date of agreement of the
Indemnitor or a final, non-appealable adjudication to but not including the

Section 11.4 Severability. If any term or other provision of this Agreement is
invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced by any rule of law or public
policy, then all other conditions and provisions of this Agreement shall
nevertheless remain in full force and effect so long as the economic or legal
substance of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement is not affected
in any manner materially adverse to any Party. If the final judgment of a
court of competent jurisdiction declares that any term or provision of this
Agreement is invalid or unenforceable, the Parties agree that the court making
the determination of invalidity or unenforceability shall have the power to
reduce the scope, duration or area of the term or provision, to delete
specific words or phrases or to replace any invalid or unenforceable term or
provision with a term or provision that is valid and enforceable and that
comes closest to expressing the intention of the invalid or unenforceable term
or provision, and this Agreement shall be enforceable as so modified after the
expiration of the time within which the judgment may be appealed.

  

  

Section 11.5 Entire Agreement; Third-Party Beneficiaries.

  

  

(a) This Agreement (including all Schedules and Exhibits attached hereto)
together with the Confidentiality Agreement and the other Transaction
Documents constitute the entire agreement and supersede all prior agreements
and understandings, both written and oral, among the Parties with respect to
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Except as otherwise set forth
in Section 11.10, this Agreement is not intended to confer upon any Person
other than the Parties hereto and the Seller Designee(s) any rights or
remedies.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

73  

  

 

 

 

  

  

(b) No provision in this Agreement modifies or amends or creates any employee
benefit plan, program or document ("Benefit Plan") unless this Agreement
explicitly states that the provision "amends" or "creates" that Benefit Plan,
and no third party shall be entitled to enforce any provision of this
Agreement on the grounds that it is an amendment to, or a creation of, a
Benefit Plan, unless that provision explicitly states that such enforcement
rights are being conferred. This provision shall not prevent the Parties to
this Agreement from enforcing any provision of this Agreement. If a person not
entitled to enforce this Agreement brings a lawsuit or other action to enforce
any provision in this Agreement as an amendment to, or creation of a Benefit
Plan, and that provision is construed to be such an amendment or creation
despite not being explicitly designated as one in this Agreement, that
provision shall lapse retroactively, thereby precluding it from having any
effect.

  

  

Section 11.6 Assignment. Neither this Agreement nor any of the rights,
interests or obligations under this Agreement shall be assigned, in whole or
in part, by operation of Law or otherwise by any of the Parties without the
prior written consent of the other Parties hereto; provided, however, that
Buyer may assign this Agreement to an Affiliate or a purchaser of
substantially all of the Purchased Assets without prior written consent (it
being agreed, however, that such assignment shall not relieve Buyer of any of
its obligations hereunder). Any purported assignment without such consent
shall be null and void. Subject to the preceding sentences, this Agreement
will be binding upon, inure to the benefit of and be enforceable by the
Parties and their respective successors and assigns.

  

  

Section 11.7 Specific Performance. The Parties agree that irreparable damage
would occur in the event any provision of this Agreement were not performed in
accordance with the terms of this Agreement and that the Parties shall be
entitled to an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement
and to enforce specifically the terms of this Agreement, in addition to any
other remedy at law or in equity, unless otherwise expressly provided for in
this Agreement pursuant to Section 2.7(f) or Section 9.2(c). Such equitable
relief shall be in addition to any other remedy to which the Parties are
entitled to at law or in equity as a remedy for such nonperformance, breach or
threatened breach. Each Party hereby waives any requirements for the securing
or posting of any bond with such equitable remedy.

  

  

Section 11.8 Governing Law. This Agreement shall be governed by, and construed
in accordance with, the laws of the State of Delaware applicable to contracts
executed in and to be performed in that state. All Actions and proceedings
arising out of or relating to this Agreement or any other Transaction Document
shall be heard and determined in the Court of Chancery of the State of
Delaware (or, if the Delaware Court of Chancery does not have jurisdiction, in
the United States District Court for the District of Delaware or any other
court sitting in the State of Delaware). The Parties hereby (a) irrevocably
submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of such court for the purpose of any
Action arising in whole or in part out of, relating to, based upon or in
connection with this Agreement or any other Transaction Document or the
subject matter hereof or thereof brought by any Party to this Agreement, (b)
irrevocably waive, and agree not to assert by way of motion, defense or
otherwise, in any such Action, any claim that it is not subject personally to
the jurisdiction of the above-named courts, that its property is exempt or
immune from attachment or execution, that the Action is brought in an
inconvenient forum, that the venue of the Action is improper or that this
Agreement or the Transaction Documents or the transactions contemplated hereby
or thereby may not be enforced in or by any of the above-named courts, and (c)
agree not to commence any such action other than before one of the above-named
courts nor to make any motion or take any other action seeking or intending to
cause the transfer or removal of any Action to any court other than one of the
above-named courts whether on the grounds of inconvenient forum or otherwise.
Process in any such suit, Action or proceeding may be served on any Party
anywhere in the world, whether within or without the jurisdiction of any such
court. Without limiting the foregoing, each Party agrees that service of
process on such Party as provided in Section 11.3 shall be deemed effective
service of process on such Party.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

74  

  

 

 

 

  

  

Section 11.9 Waiver of Jury Trial. EACH OF THE PARTIES HEREBY WAIVES TO THE
FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW ANY RIGHT IT MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL BY
JURY WITH RESPECT TO ANY ACTION DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY ARISING OUT OF, UNDER
OR IN CONNECTION WITH THIS AGREEMENT OR THE OTHER TRANSACTION DOCUMENTS OR THE
TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY OR THEREBY. Each of the Parties (a) certifies
that no Representative or attorney of any other party has represented,
expressly or otherwise, that such other party would not, in the event of
litigation, seek to enforce that foregoing waiver and (b) acknowledges that it
and the other Parties have been induced to enter into this Agreement and the
other Transaction Documents and the transactions contemplated hereby and
thereby, as applicable, by, among other things, the mutual waivers and
certifications in this Section 11.9.

  

  

Section 11.10 Affiliate Liability. Absent fraud or intentional
misrepresentation, no Seller Releasee shall have any personal liability or
personal obligation to the Buyer of any nature whatsoever in connection with
or under this Agreement, and the Buyer hereby waives and releases all claims
of any such liability and obligation.

  

  

Section 11.11 General Interpretation.

  

  

(a) The descriptive headings contained in this Agreement are included for
convenience of reference only and shall not affect in any way the meaning or
interpretation of this Agreement.

  

  

(b) Unless otherwise indicated, all references in this Agreement to Sections,
Articles, Annexes, Exhibits or Schedules shall be deemed to refer to Sections,
Articles, Annexes, Exhibits or Schedules of or to this Agreement, as
applicable.

  

  

(c) Unless otherwise indicated, the words "include," "includes" and
"including," when used in this Agreement, shall be deemed in each case to be
followed by the words "without limitation."

  

  

(d) When reference is made in this Agreement to a Person, such reference shall
be deemed to include all direct and indirect Subsidiaries of such Person
unless otherwise indicated or the context otherwise requires.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

75  

  

 

 

 

  

  

(e) The Parties to this Agreement agree that they have been represented by
counsel during the negotiation and execution of this Agreement and, therefore,
waive the application of any Law, regulation, holding, or rule of construction
providing that ambiguities in an agreement or other document will be construed
against the party drafting such agreement or document.

  

  

Section 11.12 Counterparts. This Agreement may be executed and delivered
(including by facsimile or other form of electronic transmission) in two or
more counterparts, and by the different Parties to this Agreement in separate
counterparts, each of which when executed shall be deemed to be an original
but all of which taken together shall constitute one and the same agreement.
For purposes of this Agreement, facsimile or PDF signatures shall be deemed
originals.
