portion of the Estimated Merger Consideration, less (2) such Company
Stockholder's Equityholder Escrow Amount less (3) such Company Stockholders'
Pro Rata Share of the Stockholders' Expense Fund Amount (such amount, with
respect to each such holder, being the "Stockholder Merger Payment"). Such

-25-

  execution and delivery of such letter of transmittal and any other documents
as may be reasonably requested by the Paying Agent. The Paying Agent shall,
no later than the later of (1) the Closing Date and (2) within two Business
Days after receipt by the Paying Agent of certificate(s), properly endorsed or
otherwise in proper form for transfer, formerly representing all the shares of
Company Capital Stock held by any Company Stockholder for cancellation,

as may be reasonably requested by the Paying Agent, pay to such Company
Stockholder an amount equal to such Person's Stockholder Merger Payment, in
each case payable in cash without interest and subject to applicable Tax
withholding. If payment of any portion of the applicable Stockholder Merger
Payment is to be made to a Person other than the Person in whose name the
surrendered certificate(s) are registered, it will be a condition of payment

by reason of the payment of those amounts to a Person other than the
registered holder of the certificate(s) surrendered, and will have established
to the satisfaction of Buyer that such Taxes have been paid, or (B) will have
established to the satisfaction of Buyer that such Taxes are not applicable.
From and after the Effective Time, until surrendered as contemplated by this
Section 2.9.2.(a), each certificate formerly representing shares of Company
Capital Stock will be deemed to represent for all purposes only the right to
receive the applicable consideration set forth in this Article II, if any, in
respect of such shares formerly represented thereby in accordance with the
terms hereof and in the manner provided herein.

 

(b)Company Options. Promptly after the Effective Time, the Surviving
Corporation shall pay to each holder of In-the-Money Company Options, either
directly (in respect of any payments not subject to Tax withholding) or
through the Surviving Corporation's payroll (in respect of any payments
subject to Tax withholding), as applicable, (1) such holder's aggregate
Company Option Payments less (2) such holder's Equityholder Escrow Amount less
(3) such holder's Pro Rata Share of the Stockholder's Expense Fund Amount
(such amount, with respect to each such holder, being the "Optionholder Merger
Payment"), payable in cash without interest and subject to applicable Tax
withholding and in accordance with the Surviving Corporation's applicable
payroll procedures.

 

2.9.3.Transfer Books; No Further Ownership Rights in the Capital Stock. At
the Closing, the stock transfer books of the Company will be closed, and

of certificates formerly evidencing ownership of the shares of Company Capital
Stock outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time will cease to have
any rights with respect to such shares, except as otherwise provided for
herein or by applicable Legal Requirements. After the Effective Time, Buyer
will exchange, as provided in this Article II, any presented certificate
representing shares of Company Capital Stock outstanding immediately prior to
the Effective Time.

 

2.9.4.Termination of Fund; No Liability. At any time following one (1) year
after the Effective Time, Buyer will be entitled to require the Paying Agent
to deliver to it any funds (including any earnings received with respect
thereto) that had been made available to the Paying Agent and that have not
been disbursed to holders of the Equity Interests of the Company and
thereafter such holders will be entitled to look only to Buyer (subject to
abandoned property,

 

-26-

  escheat or other similar Legal Requirements) and only as general creditors
thereof with respect to such holder's applicable payment, upon and subject to
delivery of the duly executed applicable letter of transmittal, as applicable,
and, with respect to any holder of Company Capital Stock, upon due surrender
of their certificates formerly representing shares of such stock.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, none of Buyer, the Surviving Corporation or the
Paying Agent will be liable to any holder of an Equity Interest of the Company
for any amounts delivered to a public official pursuant to any applicable
abandoned property, escheat or similar Legal Requirement.

 

2.9.5.Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates. In the event any certificate(s)
which formerly represented Equity Interests of the Company has been lost,
stolen or destroyed, upon the making and delivery of an affidavit of that fact
by the holder thereof in form reasonably satisfactory to Buyer, Buyer will pay
such holder the payment to which such holder is entitled, as provided in this
Article II; provided, however, that Buyer may, in its sole discretion and as a
condition precedent to issuing such payment, require the owner of such lost,
stolen or destroyed certificate(s) to deliver an agreement of indemnification
in form reasonably satisfactory to Buyer and a bond in such sum as Buyer may
reasonably direct as indemnity against any claim that may be made against
Buyer or the Surviving Corporation with respect to the certificate(s) alleged
to have been lost, stolen or destroyed.

 

2.10.Withholding Rights. Each of Buyer, the Surviving Corporation, the Escrow
Agent, Paying Agent, or any other applicable withholding agent designated by
the foregoing will be entitled to deduct and withhold from any consideration
otherwise payable pursuant to or as contemplated by this Agreement or any
Ancillary Agreement, such amounts as may be required to be deducted and
withheld with respect to the making of such payment under the Code or any
other Legal Requirement. To the extent that amounts are so deducted or
withheld by Buyer, the Surviving Corporation, the Escrow Agent, Paying Agent,
or any other applicable withholding agent, such deducted or withheld amounts
will be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to such
Person in respect of which such deduction or withholding was made. Other than
with respect to compensatory payments, to the extent practicable, Buyer agrees
to consult in good faith with the Stockholders' Representative (and the
Stockholders' Representative's counsel) and to allow the Stockholders'
Representative an opportunity to obtain a reduction of or relief from any
withholding by Buyer or its Affiliates. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary in this Agreement, all compensatory amounts subject to payroll
reporting and withholding payable pursuant to or as contemplated by this
Agreement shall be payable through the Surviving Corporation's payroll in
accordance with applicable payroll procedures.

 

2.11.Unclaimed Amounts. Any amounts remaining unclaimed by any holder of
Equity Interests of the Company two (2) years after the Effective Time (or
such earlier date, immediately prior to such time when the amounts would
otherwise escheat to or become the property of any Governmental Authority)
will become, to the extent permitted by applicable Legal Requirements, the
property of Buyer, free and clear of any claims or interest of any Person
previously entitled thereto.

after delivery of the Dispute Notice, either the Surviving Corporation or the

elects to submit the disputed items to KPMG LLP (the "Referee"). If KPMG
declines or is unable to serve as Referee, then Buyer and the Stockholders\'
Representative shall appoint by mutual agreement an impartial nationally

nature and amount of each item remaining in dispute, and any dispute among the
Parties regarding the interpretation of this Agreement and the terms hereof
shall be resolved, including through appropriate judicial resolution if
necessary, prior to submission of the dispute to the Referee. Each of the

properties and rights of every type and description, whether real or personal,

3.11.Real Property.

 

3.11.1.Except as described in Schedule 3.11, no Acquired Company owns or has
ever owned any real property. Schedule 3.11 describes each leasehold interest
in real property leased, subleased by, licensed or with respect to which a
right to use or occupy has been granted to or by any of the Acquired Companies
(the "Real Property"), and specifies the lessor(s) of such leased property,
the Acquired Company occupying such leased property, and identifies each lease
or any other Contractual Obligation under which such Real Property is leased
(the "Real Property Leases"). The Acquired Companies are in material
compliance with all of their obligations under the Real Property Leases.
Except as set forth on Schedule 3.11, the consummation of the Contemplated
Transactions will not result in the violation of any of the terms of any Real
Property Leases or trigger any obligation to deliver notice or obtain consent
from any lessor under any of the Real Property Leases. Each Real Property
Lease is a binding contract enforceable pursuant to its terms. There are no
ongoing events of default (as and if such term is used in each Real Property
Lease) or material defaults by the Acquired Companies or, to the Company's
Knowledge, by any other Person under any of the Real Property Leases, and the
Company has not received written notice of default by any other Person and no
facts or conditions exist that would result in an event of default or material
default upon the delivery of notice or passage of time. Except as described
on Schedule 3.11, there are no written or oral subleases, licenses,
concessions, occupancy agreements or other Contractual Obligations of the
Company granting to any other Person the right of use or occupancy of the Real
Property and there is no Person (other than an Acquired Company and any
lessor(s) of leased Real Property) in possession of the leased Real Property.
The Acquired Companies hold valid title to the leasehold estate (as lessee or
sublessee) in all Real Property Leases, set forth on Schedule 3.11, in each
case free and clear of all liens, except for Permitted Encumbrances.

 

3.11.2.The Company has delivered to Buyer true, correct and complete copies of
the Real Property Leases including all amendments, modifications, or memoranda
of lease thereto and all estoppel certificates or subordinations, non-
disturbance and attornment agreements related thereto and any other ancillary
agreements thereto. No Real Property Lease has been or, to the Company's
Knowledge, is threatened to be terminated by the relevant lessor. None of the
Acquired Companies have received any written notice from any Governmental
Authority or other third party asserting any violation of any law with respect
to any Real Property, which alleged violation remains unresolved (without on-
going obligation). None of the Acquired Companies have received any written
notice from any of the lessors under the Real Property Leases evidencing or
asserting any disputes related to the Real Property, which have not been
resolved without on-going obligations (beyond compliance with the terms of the
applicable Real Property Lease).

 

-37-

  3.11.3.Each Real Property is supplied with utilities and other services
necessary for its operation as currently operated or proposed to be operated,
all of which utilities and other services are, to the Company's Knowledge,
provided via public roads or via permanent, irrevocable appurtenant easements
benefitting the parcel of Real Property. Each parcel of Real Property abuts
on, and has direct vehicular access to, a public road, or has access to a
public road via a permanent, irrevocable appurtenant easement benefitting the
parcel of Real Property, in each case, to the extent necessary for the conduct
of the Business.

 

3.11.4.All Permits related to the Company's use of the Real Property and the
lawful occupancy thereof have been issued by the appropriate Governmental
Authorities, except as would not reasonably be expected to result in a
Material Adverse Effect. All such Permits will continue in full force and
effect immediately after giving effect to the Contemplated Transactions. To
the Company's Knowledge, the Real Property and its current use, occupancy and
operation by the Acquired Companies do not violate or conflict with any
covenants, conditions, restrictions or other Contractual Obligations to which
any of the Acquired Companies, or to the Company's Knowledge, any other
Person, is subject, including in each case the requirements of any applicable
Encumbrances thereto. No Acquired Company has received notice of any eminent
domain, condemnation or similar proceeding with respect to any portion of the
Real Property, and no such proceedings are pending or, to the Company's
Knowledge, threatened.

 

3.11.5.The Real Property and buildings, structures, equipment and improvements
that are located on or constitute part of the leased Real Property and the use
thereof by the Acquired Companies conform to all laws and regulations
(including under any applicable building, zoning, subdivision or other land
use requirements), are in good operating condition and repair in all material
respects (subject to normal wear and tear), and are suitable, adequate and
sufficient in all material respects for the purposes for which such facilities
are used. All structural, mechanical and other physical systems that
constitute part of the facilities, including the walls, roofs and structural
elements of all buildings and structures and the heating, ventilation, air
conditioning, plumbing, electrical, mechanical, sewer, waste water, storm
water, paving and parking equipment, systems and facilities included as part
of or located on the Real Property are in good operating condition and repair
in all material respects (subject to normal wear and tear). No condition or
defect in the Real Property exists that would reasonably be expected to result
in a material increase in the cost of maintenance, repair or operation of the
Real Property.

 

3.12.Equipment. All of the fixtures and other improvements to the Real
Property included in the Assets and all of the tangible personal property
included in the Assets (the "Equipment") (a) are adequate and suitable for
their present uses and (b) are in reasonably good working order, operating
condition and state of repair in all material respects (subject to normal wear

3.13.3.Schedule 3.13.3 accurately and completely identifies the Contractual
Obligations pursuant to which a Third Party has been granted a license or
other right (whether or not currently exercisable) in Company IP by any
Acquired Company. The Acquired Companies are not bound by, and no Company IP
is subject to, any Contractual Obligation containing any covenant or other
provision that materially limits or restricts the ability of the Acquired
Companies to use, exploit, assert, or enforce any Company IP anywhere in the
world. No royalties or other payments relating to the use of Intellectual
Property are payable by the Acquired Companies to any Third Party except
royalties paid for Off-the-Shelf Software.

 

3.13.4.The Acquired Companies solely and exclusively own all right, title, and
interest to and in the Company IP (other than title to Intellectual Property
licensed to the Acquired Companies, as identified in Schedule 3.13.2) free and
clear of any Encumbrances, other than Permitted Encumbrances. The Company IP
constitutes all of the Intellectual Property that is used or exploited in the
Business. Except as would not reasonably be expected to result in a Material
Adverse Effect, the Acquired Companies (a) own or have sufficient rights to
use all Company IP and (b) will have the same rights to use the Company IP
following the Closing as the Acquired Companies had immediately prior to the
Closing.

 

3.13.5.An Acquired Company is the owner of record of all Company Registered
IP. Except as would not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse
Effect, each item of Company Registered IP is valid, enforceable, and

Registered IP have been paid or is within an applicable grace period, and all
documents, recordations and certificates in connection with the Company
Registered IP currently required to be filed have been filed with the relevant
patent, copyright, trademark or other authorities in the United States or
foreign jurisdictions, as the case may be, for the purposes of prosecuting,
maintaining and perfecting the Company Registered IP and recording the
Acquired Companies' ownership interests therein, and the Acquired Companies
have taken all other actions required to maintain their rights to the Company
Registered IP. Except as would not reasonably be expected to have a Material
Adverse Effect, the Acquired Companies have complied in all material respects
with all Legal Requirements in the preparing, filing, and maintaining of the
Company IP for which the Acquired Companies have had responsibility, including
timely submitting to appropriate government patent offices all prior art that
is material to the patentability of inventions for which patent protection has
been pursued.

of the Acquired Companies who has developed or contributed to the development

Adverse Effect, the Acquired Companies have required all current and former
employees, consultants and contractors of the Acquired Companies and all other
Persons with access to an Acquired Company's confidential information to
execute written Contractual Obligations requiring them to maintain the
confidentiality of such information and use such information only for the
benefit of the Acquired Companies.

 

3.13.8.The execution, delivery, and performance of this Agreement and the
consummation of the Contemplated Transactions will not result in, or give any
Third Party the right or option to cause or declare, (i) a loss or impairment
of, or Encumbrance on, any Company IP; (ii) a breach of or default under any
Contractual Obligation relating to Company IP; (iii) the release, disclosure,
or delivery of Company IP by or to any escrow agent or Third Party; (iv) the
grant, assignment, or transfer to any Third Party of any license or other
right or interest under, to, or in any Company IP; or (v) any modification,
acceleration, termination or adverse change in any rights under any
Contractual Obligation pertaining to Company IP.

 

3.13.9.The Company Registered IP and, to the Company's Knowledge, the Company
Licensed IP, is not subject to any outstanding order, judgment or decree
adversely affecting the Acquired Companies' use of, or rights to such Company
IP. Except as would not reasonably be expected to result in a Material Adverse
Effect, the activities of the Acquired Companies, the products or services of
the Acquired Companies, and/or the conduct of the Business does not currently
infringe, interfere with, dilute, misappropriate or otherwise violate the
Intellectual Property of any Person, and has not infringed, interfered with,
diluted, misappropriated or otherwise violated, the Intellectual Property of
any Person.

 

3.13.10.No Acquired Company is a party to any Action directed or related to

Knowledge, threatened against any of the Acquired Companies (i) alleging that
any Acquired Company has infringed, interfered with, diluted misappropriated,

each of which is reasonably sufficient for the immediate and anticipated needs
of such Acquired Company including as to capacity, scalability, and ability to
process current and anticipated peak volumes in a timely manner; and (ii) will

Companies test such plans, procedures and facilities on a regular basis, and

6.11.Confidentiality.

 

6.11.1.Confidentiality of the Signatory Stockholders. Each Signatory
Stockholder acknowledges that the success of the Acquired Companies after the
Closing depends upon the continued preservation of the confidentiality of
certain information possessed by such Signatory Stockholder, that the
preservation of the confidentiality of such information by such Signatory
Stockholder is an essential premise of the bargain between the Signatory
Stockholders and Buyer, and that Buyer would be unwilling to enter into this
Agreement in the absence of this Section 6.11.1. Accordingly, each Signatory
Stockholder hereby agrees with Buyer that such Signatory Stockholder and its
Representatives will not, and that such Signatory Stockholder will instruct
its Affiliates not to, at any time, directly or indirectly, without the prior
written consent of Buyer, disclose or use, any confidential or proprietary
information involving or relating to the Business or an Acquired Company;
provided, however, that the information subject to the foregoing provisions of
this sentence will not include any information generally available to, or
known by, the public (other than as a result of disclosure in violation
hereof); and provided, further, that the provisions of this Section 6.11.1
will not prohibit any retention of copies of records or disclosure (a)
required by any applicable Legal Requirement so long as reasonable prior
notice is given of such disclosure and a reasonable opportunity is afforded to
contest the same or (b) made in connection with the enforcement of any right
or remedy relating to this Agreement or the Contemplated Transactions. The
Signatory Stockholders agree that they will be responsible for any breach or
violation of the provisions of this Section 6.11.1 by any of their
Representatives. Notwithstanding the foregoing, each Signatory Stockholder
may disclose financial information of the Acquired Companies to limited
partners and potential limited partners in a manner consistent with
disclosures that an investment fund would typically make with respect to
disclosures of portfolio company performance.

 

-64-

  6.11.2.Confidentiality of Buyer. Buyer hereby reaffirms its obligations under
the Confidentiality Agreement, dated as of December 11, 2017, by and between
Buyer and the Company and acknowledges that the confidentiality obligations
thereunder shall continue until Closing, notwithstanding anything to the
contrary therein.

 

6.12.Publicity. Unless otherwise required by applicable Legal Requirements,
including stock exchange requirements, no Party to this Agreement shall make
any public announcements in respect of this Agreement or the Contemplated
Transactions or otherwise communicate with any news media with respect thereto
without the prior written consent of the other Parties (which consent shall
not be unreasonably withheld or delayed) and the Parties shall cooperate as to
the timing and the contents of any such announcement; provided that the
Parties shall file the press release attached as Exhibit F hereto immediately
after the execution of this Agreement, and may thereafter make public
disclosures of the substance of the information set forth in such press
release.

 

6.13.Nonsolicitation. For a period of two (2) years from and after the
Closing Date, the Signatory Stockholders will not, will cause each of their
affiliated funds and investment vehicles not to, and will not direct, induce,
encourage or otherwise cause their Affiliates to, directly or indirectly, hire
or solicit for employment any employee of any Acquired Company or any
individual who was an employee of any Acquired Company within one (1) year
prior to such hiring or solicitation (provided that the foregoing restriction
on hiring and solicitation shall not apply with respect to (i) any employee
whose employment is terminated by the Company or (ii) Patrick Walsh and Eric
Evans), or otherwise induce or attempt to induce any such employees to
terminate their employment with the Acquired Companies or the Surviving
Corporation (as the case may be). If the final judgment of a court of
competent jurisdiction declares that any term or provision of this Section
6.13 is invalid or unenforceable, the Parties hereto agree such term or
provision shall be deemed to be modified to permit its enforcement to the
maximum extent permitted by law.

 

6.14.Directors' and Officers' Indemnification. 

 

(a)Buyer agrees that all rights to indemnification, advancement of expenses
and exculpation by the Company now existing in favor of each Person who is
now, or has been at any time prior to the date hereof, an officer or director
of the Company, as provided in the Organization Documents of the Company as in
effect on the date of this Agreement or in any indemnification agreement
disclosed in the Disclosure Schedule, shall survive the Closing Date and shall
continue in full force and effect in accordance with their respective terms
for a period of six (6) years after the Closing Date.

 

(b)The Surviving Corporation shall, and Buyer shall cause the Surviving
Corporation to, obtain as of the Closing Date, "tail" insurance policies with
a claims period of six (6) years from the Closing Date with at least the same
coverage and amounts, and containing terms and conditions that are not less
advantageous to the directors and officers of the Company, in each case with
respect to claims arising out of or relating to events which occurred on or
prior to the Closing Date; provided that, notwithstanding the foregoing, in no
event shall the Surviving Corporation be required to expend an annual premium
for such coverage in excess of 175 % of the last annual premium paid by the
Company for such insurance prior to the date of

 

-65-

  this Agreement (the "Maximum Amount"). If such "tail" insurance cannot be
obtained at an amount equal to or less than the Maximum Amount, the Surviving
Corporation shall, and Buyer shall cause the Surviving Corporation to obtain,
that amount of directors' and officers' insurance or "tail" coverage
obtainable for an amount equal to the Maximum Amount.

 

(c)The obligations of Buyer and the Surviving Corporation under this Section
6.14 shall not be terminated or modified in such a manner as to adversely
affect any director or officer to whom this Section 6.14 applies without the
consent of such affected director or officer (it being expressly agreed that
the directors and officers to whom this Section 6.14 applies shall be third-
party beneficiaries of this Section 6.14, each of whom may enforce the
provisions of this Section 6.14).

 

6.15.Further Assurances. From and after the Closing Date, upon the request of
either the Stockholders' Representative or Buyer, each of the Parties hereto
will do, execute, acknowledge and deliver all such further acts, assurances,
deeds, assignments, transfers, conveyances and other instruments and papers as
may be reasonably required or appropriate to carry out the Contemplated
Transactions. 

 

6.16.Tax Matters. From the date of this Agreement until the Closing Date,
without the prior written consent of Buyer, neither the Seller nor any of the
Acquired Companies shall make, change or revoke any material Tax election;
elect or change any method of accounting for Tax purposes or Tax accounting
period; amend any Tax Return; file any Tax Return in a manner inconsistent
with past practice; surrender any right to, or file any claim for, a material
Tax refund; settle or compromise any Action in respect of Taxes; enter into
any Contractual Obligation in respect of Taxes with any Governmental Authority
or consent to any extension or waiver of the limitation period applicable to
any Tax claim or assessment relating to any Acquired Company.

 

6.17.280G Stockholder Approval. As soon as practicable after the date hereof
and in any event prior to the Closing, the Company shall use its best efforts
to obtain an approval of the Company's stockholders (and other parties
entitled to vote) in a manner that satisfies all applicable requirements of
Section 280G(b)(5) of the Code and Treasury Regulations § 1.280G-1 (the
"Requisite Approval"), for approval of any payments or benefits that may be
made or provided to any Person who, with respect to any Acquired Company, is a
"disqualified individual" (as such term is defined for purposes of Section
280G of the Code), if such payments and benefits would otherwise be a
"parachute payment" under Section 280G of the Code. The Company shall deliver
to Buyer all waivers, shareholder votes, disclosures and related materials
(including detailed calculations) that it has prepared in connection with its
obligations under this Section 6.17 no later than five (5) Business Days prior
to the Closing, and shall deliver to Buyer prior to the Closing such evidence
as may be reasonably acceptable to Buyer that the Requisite Approval was
obtained, or that the Requisite Approval was not obtained. In no case shall
any Acquired Company or any of its Affiliates pay any amount waived by a
disqualified individual in connection with the Company's efforts to obtain the
Requisite Approval unless the Requisite Approval was obtained.

 

-66-

  6.18.Employee Matters.

 

6.18.1.Buyer shall, or shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, provide each
employee of the Acquired Companies as of the date hereof who remains employed
by the Surviving Corporation during the one-year period following the Closing
(each, a "Continuing Employee") (i) until the first anniversary of the
Closing, a base rate of pay and, until December 31, 2019, a cash bonus
opportunity (excluding any equity or equity-based incentive bonus
opportunities) that are, in each case, no less favorable than those provided
to such Continuing Employee immediately prior to the Closing and (ii) employee
benefits (excluding any severance, change in control, retention or similar, or
equity or equity-based incentive, benefits or compensation) that are
substantially comparable in the aggregate to those provided by the Acquired
Companies immediately prior to the Closing or those provided to similarly
situated employees of Buyer and its Affiliates.

 

6.18.2.For purposes of vesting, eligibility to participate and level of
benefits under the employee benefit plans of Buyer (but not for purposes of
any benefit accruals or any purpose under a defined benefit pension plan)
providing benefits to any Continuing Employees after the Effective Time (the
"New Plans"), each Continuing Employee shall be credited with his or her years
of service with the Company before the Effective Time, to the same extent as
such Continuing Employee was entitled before the Effective Time, to credit for
such service under any similar Company Plan in which such Continuing Employee
participated immediately prior to the Effective Time, except to the extent
that its application would result in a duplication of benefits. In addition,
Buyer shall use commercially reasonable efforts to (i) provide that each
Continuing Employee shall be immediately eligible to participate, without any
waiting time, in any and all New Plans to the extent coverage under such New
Plan is comparable to a Company Plan in which such Continuing Employee
participated immediately before the Effective Time (such plans, collectively,
the "Old Plans"), (ii) for purposes of each New Plan providing medical,
dental, pharmaceutical and/or vision benefits to any Continuing Employee,
cause all pre-existing condition exclusions and actively-at-work requirements
of such New Plan to be waived for such Continuing Employee and his or her
covered dependents, unless such conditions would not have been waived under
the Old Plans, and (iii) cause any eligible expenses incurred by such
Continuing Employee and his or her covered dependents during the portion of
the plan year of the Old Plans ending on the date such Continuing Employee's
participation in the corresponding New Plan begins to be taken into account
under such New Plan for purposes of satisfying all deductible, coinsurance and
maximum out-of-pocket requirements applicable to such Continuing Employee and
his or her covered dependents for the applicable plan year as if such amounts
had been paid in accordance with such New Plan. No provision of this Agreement
shall (i) create any third-party beneficiary or other rights in any current or
former employee, director, officer or independent contractor of Buyer, the
Surviving Corporation or their respective Affiliates to enforce the provisions
of this Section 6.18, (ii) be construed as an establishment, adoption,
termination, amendment, or other modification of any Company Plan or other
employee benefit plan, (iii) limit in any way the right of Buyer, the
Surviving Corporation or their respective Affiliates to amend or terminate any
Company Plan at any time or (iv) create any rights in any current or former
employee, director, independent contractor or other service provider of Buyer,
any Acquired Company or any of their respective Affiliates (or any
beneficiaries, dependents or legal representatives thereof) or any other
Person not a party to this Agreement, including any right to employment,
continued employment for any specified period, any level of Compensation or
benefits or any other term or condition of employment.

 

6.19.Termination of Affiliate Arrangements.

 

 The Acquired Companies shall cause all agreements between an Acquired
Company, on the one hand, and any of their respective

 

-67-

  affiliates, on the other hand, to be terminated, and all obligations and
liabilities thereunder to be satisfied, prior to the Closing Date, other than
(a) agreements listed on Schedule 6.19 and (b) agreements and transactions
solely between or among one or more of the Acquired Companies.

 

6.20.Resignations.

 

 The Acquired Companies and each of the Signatory Stockholders shall use
commercially reasonable efforts to cause each director and officer of the
Acquired Companies to deliver written resignations to the Acquired Companies
prior to the Closing Date, which resignations shall be effective upon the
Closing.

 

6.21.Termination Benefits. In the event any Termination Benefits become
payable pursuant to Section 6(c)(ii) (but only if claimed in connection with
the executive no longer serving on the Board of Directors of the Company or
the Surviving Corporation or if claimed solely as a result of a change in
title (and not, for the avoidance of doubt, if claimed as a result of a
material diminution in authority, duties or responsibilities with respect to
the business of the Acquired Companies)) or Section 6(c)(iii) of an Executive
Employment Agreement (such sections entitled "Termination by Employee for Good
Reason"), or Section 6(d) of an Executive Employment Agreement (such section
entitled "Termination by Employee Following a Change of Control"), in each
case within six (6) months following the Closing Date and not, for the
avoidance of doubt, pursuant to any other section of an Executive Employment
Agreement, then Buyer and the Stockholders' Representative will promptly
deliver a joint written instruction to the Escrow Agent to release to Buyer
out of funds from the Severance Escrow Account the aggregate amount of such
Termination Benefits. Upon the date that is six (6) months and one (1) day
following the Closing Date, Buyer and the Stockholders' Representative shall
promptly deliver a joint written instruction to the Escrow Agent to release
the then-remaining balance of the Severance Escrow Account (together with all
interest and earnings thereon) to the Company Securityholders; provided that
any portion of the Severance Escrow Account payable in respect of Company
Options shall be paid through the Surviving Corporation's payroll.

subject to the limitations set forth in this Article X, each Company
Securityholder will severally, in accordance with each such Company
Securityholder's Pro Rata Share, indemnify and hold harmless Buyer and
MergerSub and each of their Affiliates (including, following the Closing, the
Surviving Corporation), and the Representatives and Affiliates of each of the
foregoing Persons (each, a "Buyer Indemnified Person"), from, against and in
respect of any and all Losses, whether or not involving a Third Party Claim
incurred or suffered by the Buyer Indemnified Persons or any of them as a
result of, arising out of or directly or indirectly relating to:

 

(a)any breach of, or inaccuracy in, any representation or warranty made by the
Company in Article III of this Agreement or in any certificate delivered
pursuant to this Agreement (in each case, as such representation or warranty
would read if all qualifications as to materiality, including each reference
to the defined term "Material Adverse Effect," were deleted therefrom);

 

(b)any breach or violation of any covenant or agreement of the Company in this
Agreement to the extent required to be performed or complied with by the
Company prior to the Closing in this Agreement;

as incurred by the Company, Buyer or the Surviving Corporation in connection
with the exercise of all rights by Company Securityholders under Section 262
of the DGCL.

 

10.1.2.Indemnification Regarding Signatory Stockholders. From and after the
Closing, subject to the limitations set forth in this Article X, each

all Losses, whether or not involving a Third Party Claim incurred or suffered
by the Buyer Indemnified Persons or any of them as a result of, arising out of
or directly or indirectly relating to:

 

-72-

  (a)any breach of, or inaccuracy in, any representation or warranty made by
such Signatory Stockholder in Article IV of this Agreement (in each case, as
such representation or warranty would read if all qualifications as to
materiality or material adverse effect were deleted therefrom); and

 

(b)any breach or violation of any covenant or agreement of such Signatory
Stockholder in this Agreement.

 

10.1.3.Limitations.

 

(a)The Company Securityholders will have no obligation to indemnify the Buyer
Indemnified Persons pursuant to Section 10.1.1.(a) or Section 10.1.2.(a) in
respect of Losses (i) with respect to any individual claim for which the
Losses do not exceed $25,000 (provided that, if the total Losses with respect
to all claims exceed $100,000, the full amount of such Losses shall be
recoverable by the Buyer Indemnified Persons without regard to the foregoing
limitation) and (ii) unless the aggregate amount of all such Losses taken into
account under clause (i) and incurred or suffered by the Buyer Indemnified
Persons exceeds $1,260,000.00 (the "Deductible"), in which event the Company
Securityholders will only be required to pay for Losses in excess of such
amount, and the aggregate liability of the Company Securityholders in respect
of such Indemnity Claims pursuant to Section 10.1.1.(a) and 10.1.2.(a) will
not exceed $1,260,000.00 (the "Cap"); provided, however, that the foregoing
limitations will not apply to (i) claims for indemnification pursuant to
Section 10.1.1.(a) and Section 10.1.2.(a) in respect of breaches of, or
inaccuracies in, any of the Company Fundamental Representations, (ii) claims
based upon Fraud, or (iii) any matters related to Taxes. For purposes of this
Section 10.1, the amount of any Losses relating to any inaccuracy in or breach
of any representation or warranty shall be determined without regard to any
materiality, Material Adverse Effect or other similar qualification contained
in or otherwise applicable to such representation or warranty.

 

(b)Other than in the case of Fraud, in no event shall the aggregate obligation
of any Company Securityholder to indemnify the Buyer Indemnified Persons
pursuant to Section 10.1 exceed the proceeds actually received by such Company
Securityholder hereunder.

 

(c)The amount of any Losses for which indemnification is payable under this
Article X shall be reduced to take account of any amounts actually received by
the Buyer Indemnified Persons under applicable insurance policies (other than
the RandW Policy), under indemnification or similar agreements, or other rights
of recovery with respect to such Losses (other than from an Affiliate of such
Buyer Indemnified Person), net of any deductible or any other reasonable and
necessary out-of-pocket expense incurred by the Buyer Indemnified Person in
obtaining such recovery. If a Buyer Indemnified Person receives any such
recovery described above that was not previously taken into account after an
indemnification payment by the Indemnifying Party has been made, then such
Buyer Indemnified Person shall promptly reimburse the Indemnifying Party for
any payment made, but not in excess of the amount received by the Buyer
Indemnified Person. Each Buyer Indemnified Person shall take all commercially
reasonably actions to seek full and prompt recovery under all insurance
policies and any other rights, remedies or agreements covering any Losses to
the same extent as if it would if such Loss were not subject to
indemnification hereunder. Each Buyer Indemnified Person waives, to the
extent permitted under its applicable insurance policies, any subrogration
rights that its insurer may have with respect to indemnifiable Losses. 

 

-73-

  (d)The Company Securityholders shall have no liability pursuant to Section
10.1.1(a) with respect to a Loss to the extent such Loss relates to a breach
of or inaccuracy in Section 3.17, unless such Losses are incurred with respect
to a Pre-Closing Tax Period.

 

10.2.Indemnity by Buyer.

 

10.2.1.Indemnification. From and after the Closing, subject to the
limitations set forth in this Article X, Buyer will indemnify and hold
harmless each Company Securityholder and such holder's respective Affiliates,
and the Representatives and Affiliates of each of the foregoing Persons (each,
a "Securityholder Indemnified Person"), from, against and in respect of any
and all Losses incurred or suffered by the Securityholder Indemnified Persons
or any of them as a result of, arising out of or relating to, directly or
indirectly:

 

(a)any breach of, or inaccuracy in, any representation or warranty made by
Buyer in this Agreement delivered pursuant to this Agreement (in each case, as
such representation or warranty would read if all qualifications as to
materiality or material adverse effect were deleted therefrom); or

 

(b)any breach or violation of any covenant or agreement of Buyer (including
under this Article X) or any covenant or agreement of the Company to the
extent required to be performed or complied with by the Company after the
Closing, in either case in this Agreement.

 

10.2.2.Monetary Limitations. Buyer will have no obligation to indemnify the
Securityholder Indemnified Persons pursuant to Section 10.2.1.(a) in respect
of Losses (i) with respect to any individual claim for which the Losses do not
exceed $25,000 (provided that, if the total Losses with respect to all claims
exceeds $100,000, the full amount of such Losses shall be recoverable by the
Securityholder Indemnified Persons without regard to the foregoing limitation)
and (ii) until the aggregate amount of all such Losses incurred or suffered by
the Securityholder Indemnified Persons exceeds the Deductible, in which case
Buyer shall only be required to pay for Losses in excess of such amount, and
Buyer's aggregate liability in respect of such Indemnity Claims pursuant to
Section 10.2.1.a) will not exceed the Cap; provided, however, that foregoing
limitations will not apply to (a) claims for indemnification pursuant to
Section 10.2.1.(a) in respect of breaches of, or inaccuracies in, any of Buyer
Fundamental Representations or (b) claims based upon Fraud. For purposes of
this Section 10.2, the amount of any Losses relating to any inaccuracy in or
breach of any representation or warranty shall be determined without regard to
any materiality, material adverse effect or other similar qualification
contained in or otherwise applicable to such representation or warranty.

 

10.2.3.Indemnification Priority. If a Buyer Indemnified Person has
indemnification claims for Losses under this Article X arising from a breach
of a representation or warranty that is insured under the RandW Policy, then
such Buyer Indemnified Person shall seek recovery with respect to such claims
as follows: (a) first, until the retention is met under the RandW Policy, such
Buyer Indemnified Person shall pursue recovery from the Indemnification Escrow
Account (to the extent such Losses exceed the Deductible); (b) second, after
the applicable retention under the RandW Policy has been satisfied, such Buyer
Indemnified Person shall pursue recovery by making and pursuing such claim
under the RandW Policy; and (c) third,

 

-74-

  if (i) the claim is for a breach of a Company Fundamental Representation and
(ii) such Buyer Indemnified Person has made a valid and timely claim under the
RandW Policy and the insurer providing coverage under the RandW Policy has
indicated to such Buyer Indemnified Person in writing (after reasonable
pursuit by such Buyer Indemnified Person of such claim under the RandW Policy)
that the claim will not be paid or payment under the RandW Policy has been
exhausted, then such Buyer Indemnified Person shall be entitled to pursue
recovery of any remaining Losses directly from the Company Securityholders,
subject to the provisions and limitations set forth in this Agreement.

 

10.3.Time for Claims. 

 

10.3.1.No claim may be made or suit instituted seeking indemnification
pursuant to Section 10.1.1.(a), Section 10.1.2.(a) or Section 10.2.1.a) unless
a written notice describing such claim in reasonable detail in light of the
circumstances then known to the Indemnified Party is provided to the

of, or inaccuracy in, any of the Company Fundamental Representations or Buyer
Fundamental Representations;

expiration of the applicable statute of limitations (taking into account any
tolling periods and other extensions) in the case of any matters relating to
Taxes; and

 

(d)at any time within twelve (12) months of the Closing in the case of any
breach of, or inaccuracy in, any other representation and warranty in this
Agreement.

 

10.3.2.No claim may be made or suit instituted seeking indemnification
pursuant to Section 10.1.1(c) (except with respect to Taxes, which shall be
treated in accordance with Section 10.3.3) unless a written notice describing
such claim in reasonable detail in light of the circumstances then known to
the Indemnified Party is provided to the Indemnifying Party at any time within
twelve (12) months of the Closing.

 

10.3.3.Claims for indemnification pursuant to Section 10.1.1.b), Section
10.1.1(c) (with respect to Taxes only), Section 10.1.1.(d), Section 10.1.1.e),
Section 10.1.2.b) and Section 10.2.1.b) shall survive until the expiration of
the applicable statute of limitations (taking into account any tolling periods
and other extensions).

 

10.4.Third Party Claims.

 

10.4.1.Notice of Claim. If any Third Party notifies an Indemnified Party with
respect to any matter (a "Third Party Claim") which is expected to give rise
to an Indemnified Claim against an Indemnifying Party under this Article X,
then the Indemnified Party will promptly give written notice to the
Indemnifying Party; provided, however, that no delay on the part of the
Indemnified Party in notifying the Indemnifying Party will relieve the
Indemnifying Party from any obligation under this Article X, except to the
extent such delay actually and materially prejudices the Indemnifying Party.

 

-75-

  10.4.2.Assumption of Defense, etc. The Indemnifying Party will be entitled to
participate in the defense of any Third Party Claim that is the subject of a
notice given by the Indemnified Party pursuant to Section 10.4.1. In
addition, the Indemnifying Party will have the right to defend the Indemnified
Party against the Third Party Claim with counsel of its choice reasonably
satisfactory to the Indemnified Party so long as (a) the Indemnifying Party
gives written notice to the Indemnified Party within fifteen (15) days after
the Indemnified Party has given notice of the Third Party Claim that the
Indemnifying Party elects to defend the Third Party Claim, (b) the
Indemnifying Party provides the Indemnified Party with evidence reasonably
acceptable to the Indemnified Party that the Indemnifying Party will have
adequate financial resources to defend against the Third Party Claim, (c) the
Third Party Claim involves only money damages and does not seek an injunction
or other equitable relief against the Indemnified Party, (d) the Indemnified
Party has not been advised by counsel that an actual or potential conflict
exists between the Indemnified Party and the Indemnifying Party in connection
with the defense of the Third Party Claim, (e) the Third Party Claim does not
relate to or otherwise arise in connection with any criminal or regulatory
enforcement Action and (f) the Indemnifying Party conducts the defense of the
Third Party Claim actively and diligently. The Indemnifying Party agrees to
use commercially reasonable efforts as required by the Insureds under the RandW
Policy, at the RandW Policy's insurer's sole cost, to provide such insurer with
any information, assistance and cooperation reasonably requested in writing by
such insurer in connection with a Third Party Claim relating to the RandW
Policy. The Indemnified Party may retain separate co-counsel at its sole cost
and expense and participate in the defense of the Third Party Claim; provided,
however, that the Indemnifying Party will pay the fees and expenses of
separate co-counsel retained by the Indemnified Party that are incurred prior
to Indemnifying Party's assumption of control of the defense of the Third
Party Claim.

 

10.4.3.Limitations on Indemnifying Party. The Indemnifying Party will not
consent to the entry of any judgment or enter into any compromise or
settlement with respect to the Third Party Claim without the prior written
consent of the Indemnified Party (which consent will not be unreasonably
withheld or delayed) unless such judgment, compromise or settlement (a)
provides for the payment by the Indemnifying Party of money as sole relief for
the claimant, (b) results in the full, unconditional and general release of
the Buyer Indemnified Persons or Securityholder Indemnified Persons, as
applicable, from all liabilities arising or relating to, or in connection
with, the Third Party Claim, and (c) involves no finding or admission of
fault, breach, liability or any violation of Legal Requirements or the rights
of any Person and has no effect on any other claims that may be made against
the Indemnified Party.

 

10.4.4.Indemnified Party's Control. If the Indemnifying Party does not
deliver the notice contemplated by clause (a), or the evidence contemplated by
clause (b), of Section 10.4.2 within fifteen (15) days after the Indemnified
Party has given notice of the Third Party Claim, or otherwise at any time
fails to conduct the defense of the Third Party Claim actively and diligently,
the Indemnified Party may defend, and may consent to the entry of any judgment
or enter into any compromise or settlement with respect to, the Third Party
Claim in any manner it may deem appropriate (and the Indemnified Party need
not consult with, or obtain any consent from, the Indemnifying Party in
connection therewith). If such notice and evidence is given on a timely basis
and the Indemnifying Party conducts the defense of the Third Party Claim
actively and diligently but any of the other conditions in Section 10.4.2 is
or becomes unsatisfied, the Indemnified Party may defend, and may consent to
the entry of any judgment or enter into any compromise or settlement with
respect to, the Third Party Claim. 

 

-76-

  10.4.5.This Section 10.4 shall not apply to matters relating to Taxes, which
are governed by Article XI.

 

10.5.No Circular Recovery. Each Company Securityholder hereby agrees that it
will not make any claim for indemnification against Buyer, MergerSub or any
Acquired Company by reason of the fact that such Company Securityholder was a
controlling person, director, employee or Representative of the Company or was
serving as such for another Person at the request of the Company (whether such
claim is for Losses of any kind or otherwise and whether such claim is
pursuant to any statute, Organizational Document, Contractual Obligation or
otherwise) with respect to any claim brought by a Buyer Indemnified Person
against any Company Securityholder relating to this Agreement or any of the
Contemplated Transactions or the facts and circumstances underlying any such
claim. With respect to any claim brought by a Buyer Indemnified Person
against any Company Securityholder relating to this Agreement and any of the
Contemplated Transactions, each Company Securityholder expressly waives any
right of subrogation, contribution, advancement, indemnification or other
claim against any Company with respect to any amounts owed by such Company
Securityholder pursuant to this Article X.

 

10.6.Indemnification Escrow. The sole and exclusive source for recovery of
the Buyer Indemnified Persons for claims for indemnification pursuant to
Section 10.1.1.(a) and Section 10.2.1.(a) shall be from the Indemnification
Escrow Account, except in respect of (i) breaches of, or inaccuracies in, any
of the Company Fundamental Representations, (ii) claims based upon Fraud,
(iii) any matters related to Taxes or (iv) claims under the RandW Policy.

 

10.7.Knowledge and Investigation. The right of any Buyer Indemnified Person
or Securityholder Indemnified Person to indemnification pursuant to this
Article X or Article XI will not be affected by any investigation conducted or
knowledge acquired (or capable of being acquired) at any time, whether before
or after the execution and delivery of this Agreement or the Closing, with
respect to the accuracy of any representation or warranty, or performance of
or compliance with any covenant or agreement, referred to in Section 10.1 and
Section 10.2. The waiver of any condition contained in this Agreement or in
any Ancillary Agreement based on the breach of any such representation or
warranty, or on the performance of or compliance with any such covenant or
agreement, will not affect the right of any Buyer Indemnified Person or
Securityholder Indemnified Person to indemnification pursuant to this Article
X or Article XI based on such representation, warranty, covenant or agreement.

 

10.8.Remedies Cumulative. The rights of each Buyer Indemnified Person and
Securityholder Indemnified Person under this Article X and Article XI are
cumulative, and each Buyer Indemnified Person and Securityholder Indemnified
Person, as the case may be, will have the right in any particular
circumstance, in its sole discretion, to enforce any provision of this Article
X and Article XI without regard to the availability of a remedy under any
other provision of this Article X and Article XI.

 

-77-

  10.9.Exclusive Remedies. Subject to Section 2.14 and Section 12.12, the
Parties acknowledge and agree that their sole and exclusive remedy with
respect to any and all claims (other than claims based on Fraud or claims
under the RandW Policy) for any breach of any representation, warranty,
covenant, agreement or obligation set forth herein or otherwise relating to
the subject matter of this Agreement, shall be pursuant to the indemnification
provisions set forth in Article X and Article XI. Nothing in this Section 10.9
shall limit any Person's right to (i) seek and obtain any equitable relief to
which any Person shall be entitled; (ii) seek any remedy on account of any
party's Fraud; or (iii) prevent any Buyer Indemnified Person from seeking
recovery or recovering under the RandW Policy in accordance with its terms.

 

Article XI 
TAX MATTERS

 

11.1.Returns. The Stockholders' Representative shall prepare and file or
otherwise furnish to the appropriate party (or cause to be prepared and filed
or so furnished) in a timely manner all Tax Returns relating to the Acquired
Companies that are due on or before the Closing Date. Buyer shall have a
reasonable opportunity to review any income Tax Returns required to be filed
by the Acquired Companies after the date of signing of this Agreement but
prior to the Closing Date. The Acquired Companies shall in good faith consider
incorporation of any comments made by Buyer on such income Tax Returns. Buyer
shall prepare or cause to be prepared and file or caused to be filed in a
timely manner all Tax Returns relating to the Acquired Companies that are due
after the Closing Date and that relate to a taxable period (or a portion
thereof) ending on or prior to the Closing Date (the "Pre-Closing Tax
Returns"). Such Pre-Closing Tax Returns shall be prepared in a manner
consistent with past practice unless otherwise required by applicable Legal
Requirements, provided, however, that the Acquired Companies shall deduct the
Transaction Deductions to the extent permitted by applicable Legal
Requirements as provided in the definition thereof on the Pre-Closing Tax
Returns. Buyer shall provide drafts of the Pre-Closing Tax Returns to the
Stockholders' Representative at least thirty (30) days prior to the filing of
any Pre-Closing Tax Returns that relate to income or other material Taxes for
the Stockholders' Representative's review, comment and approval (such approval
not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed). In the event Buyer
and Stockholders' Representative cannot resolve any disputes after twenty (20)
days of good faith discussions, the dispute shall be referred to and resolved
by an independent accounting firm mutually agreeable to both Buyer and
Stockholders' Representative, the cost of which shall be borne by the Party
that loses the dispute. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, in
the event any disputes are not resolved prior to the due date for filing of
such Tax Returns (taking into consideration applicable extensions), such Tax
Returns shall be filed consistent with the Buyer's position, subject to later
amendment to reflect any resolutions of such disputes (including by the
independent accounting firm). Buyer shall cause any Pre-Closing Tax Returns
prepared and finalized hereunder to be timely filed. To the extent the amount
of Pre-Closing Taxes have not been taken into account in the final Merger
Consideration, such amount shall be paid at least five (5) days prior to the
due date of the applicable Pre-Closing Tax Return by Stockholders'
Representative, on behalf of the Company Securityholders in accordance with
each such Company Securityholder's Pro Rata Share, to Buyer, and to the extent
elected so by the Stockholders' Representative, such amount shall be paid out
of the Stockholders' Expense Fund Amount.

 

-78-

  11.2.Contests.

 

11.2.1.After the Closing, Buyer shall promptly notify the Stockholders'
Representative in writing of the proposed assessment or the commencement of
any Tax Action or of any demand or claim on any Buyer Indemnified Person that,
if determined adversely to the taxpayer or after the lapse of time, could be
grounds for indemnification by the Company Securityholders pursuant to this
Agreement. Such notice shall contain factual information describing the
asserted Tax Liability in reasonable detail and shall include copies of any
notice or other document received from any Governmental Authority in respect
of any such asserted Tax Liability.

 

11.2.2.In the case of a Tax Action that relates to a taxable period ending on
or before the Closing Date and in respect of which the Company Securityholders
could have an indemnification obligation pursuant to this Agreement, after
taking into account the provisions hereof (a "Contest"), and provided such Tax
Action does not affect the Taxes of Buyer or its Affiliates (including the
Surviving Corporation) in a taxable period (or portion thereof) beginning
after the Closing Date, the Stockholders' Representative shall have the sole
right, on behalf of the Company Securityholders and at their expense to
participate in the defense of any Contest that is the subject of notice given
by Buyer pursuant to Section 11.2.1 and the right to control the conduct of
such Contest with counsel of their choice reasonably satisfactory to Buyer so
long as the Stockholders' Representative notifies Buyer in writing within
fifteen (15) days after Buyer has given notice of the Contest that the Company
Securityholders will control such Contest. Buyer may retain separate co-
counsel at its sole cost and expense and participate in the defense of the
Contest. Neither the Company Securityholders nor the Stockholders'
Representative will consent to the entry of any judgment or enter into any
compromise or settlement with respect to a Contest without the prior written
consent of Buyer, such consent not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or
delayed. If Stockholders' Representative does not deliver the notice
contemplated by clause (i) above within fifteen (15) days after Buyer has
given notice of a Contest, or if such Contest does affect the Taxes of Buyer
or its Affiliates (including the Surviving Corporation) in a taxable period
beginning after the Closing Date, Buyer shall control such Contest; provided
that the Stockholders' Representative may retain separate co-counsel at its
sole cost and expense and participate in the defense of the Contest and Buyer
may not consent to the entry of any judgment or enter into any compromise or
settlement with respect to the Contest without the prior written consent of
the Stockholders' Representative, such consent not to be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned or delayed. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in
this Agreement, Buyer shall not be required to provide any access to or to
permit any inspection of any Tax Return of the Affiliated Group of the Buyer
or its Affiliates (including, for the avoidance of doubt, with respect to the
Company following the Closing Date), and the Stockholders' Representative
shall not participate in or control any Contest to the extent such Contest
relates to any Tax Return of the Affiliated Group of the Buyer or its
Affiliates; provided that if the Company Securityholders could have an
indemnification obligation pursuant to this Agreement in respect of such
Contest, the Buyer (i) shall keep the Stockholders' Representative reasonably
informed of the on-going proceeding and (ii) shall not settle or compromise
such Contest without the prior written consent of the Stockholders'
Representative, which consent (A) shall not to be unreasonably withheld,
delayed or conditioned and (B) shall be based on such information (other than
such Tax Returns of the Affiliated Group of the Buyer or its Affiliates),
calculations and methodologies provided by the Buyer (and certified by the an
officer of the Buyer) as are reasonably necessary for the Stockholders'
Representative to provide such consent.

 

-79-

  11.3.Post-Closing Actions. Except as required by applicable Legal
Requirements and to the extent the Company Securityholders could have an
indemnification obligation pursuant to this Agreement, after taking into
account the provisions hereof, none of Buyer, the Surviving Corporation, or
any Affiliate shall (i) amend, re-file or otherwise modify (or grant an
extension of any statute of limitation with respect to) any Tax Return
relating in whole or in part to an Acquired Company with respect to any Pre-
Closing Period, (ii) voluntarily initiate discussions or examinations with
Governmental Authorities regarding Taxes with respect to an Acquired Company
for a Pre-Closing Period or make any voluntary disclosures with to an Acquired
Company for a Pre-Closing Period, (iii) make or change any material Tax
election, change in accounting method or adopt any convention that shifts
material taxable income of an Acquired Company from a Tax period beginning (or
deemed to begin) after the Closing Date to a Pre-Closing Period or shifts
deductions or losses from a Pre-Closing Period to a Tax period beginning (or
deemed to begin) after the Closing Date, (iv) make an election under Sections
336 or 338 of the Code or any similar provision of foreign, state or local law
in respect of an Acquired Company, or (v) take any action on the Closing Date
after the Closing outside of the Ordinary Course of Business and not in
accordance of the provisions of this Agreement, without the prior written
consent of the Stockholders' Representative. To the extent of a conflict
between this Section 11.3 and the provisions of Section 11.1, the provisions
of Section 11.1 shall control.

 

11.4.Tax Refunds.

 

11.4.1. To the extent the Company Securityholders are obligated to indemnify
pursuant to this Agreement, after taking into account the provisions hereof,
in a taxable period to which a refund of Taxes is attributable, any net
refunds for Taxes (including any interest in respect thereof) received by
Buyer, the Surviving Corporation or any of their Affiliates, and any amounts
credited as an offset against Taxes otherwise due to which Buyer, the
Surviving Corporation or any of their Affiliates become entitled that are
related to, or resulting or arising from any Taxes of an Acquired Company for
a Pre-Closing Tax Period, net of any additional Taxes or out of pocket
expenses incurred in connection therewith, shall be for the benefit of the
Company Securityholders. A Tax refund (or credit for overpayment of Taxes)
shall be deemed received or credited as an offset against Taxes at the time
the final Tax Return showing an overpayment of Tax is filed with a
Governmental Authority. Buyer shall pay to the Company Securityholders any
such refund or the amount of any such credit within five (5) Business Days of
receipt or entitlement thereto.

 

11.5.Tax Sharing Agreements. All Tax sharing agreements or similar agreements
(other than any contract entered into in the ordinary course of business, the
principal purpose of which is unrelated to Taxes) and all powers of attorney
with respect to or involving any Acquired Company will be terminated prior to
the Closing and, after the Closing, the Acquired Companies will not be bound
thereby or have any Liability thereunder.

 

11.6.Certain Taxes and Fees. All Transfer Taxes incurred in connection with
the Contemplated Transactions, will be borne fifty percent (50%) by Buyer and
fifty percent (50%) by the Company Securityholders when due. The
Stockholders' Representative will file all necessary Tax Returns and other
documentation with respect to all such Transfer Taxes and, if required by
applicable Legal Requirements, Buyer will (and will cause its Affiliates to)
join in the execution of any such Tax Returns and other documentation. The
Stockholders' Representative and Buyer will each bear fifty percent (50%) of
any out of pocket third party expenses in connection with such filings.

 

-80-

  11.7.Cooperation on Tax Matters. Buyer, the Acquired Companies and the
Stockholders' Representative will cooperate fully, as and to the extent
reasonably requested by the other Party, in connection with any Tax matters
relating to the Acquired Companies. Such cooperation shall include the
retention and (upon the other Party's request) the provision of records and
information that are reasonably relevant and available to any such Tax matter.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, Buyer shall not be
required to provide, to permit any inspection of, or to disclose any
information with respect to, any Tax Return of the Affiliated Group of Buyer
or its Affiliates.

 

11.8.Treatment of Payments. Each Party agrees to treat all payments, other
than compensatory payments, made by it to or for the benefit of another Party
under indemnity provisions of this Agreement, as adjustments to the purchase
price (as determined for Tax purposes) paid in connection with the Merger, and
such treatment shall govern for purposes hereof except to the extent that the
Legal Requirements of a particular jurisdiction provide otherwise.

Each of the Parties to this Agreement may specify different address or
facsimile number by giving notice in accordance with this Section 12.1 to each
of the other Parties hereto.

 

12.2.Succession and Assignment; No Third-Party Beneficiary. Subject to the
immediately following sentence, this Agreement will be binding upon and inure
to the benefit of the Parties hereto and their respective successors and
permitted assigns, each of which such successors and permitted assigns will be
deemed to be a party hereto for all purposes hereof. No Party may assign,
delegate or otherwise transfer either this Agreement or any of its rights,
interests, or obligations hereunder without the prior written approval of
Buyer and Company; provided, however, that Buyer may (a) assign any or all of
its rights and interests hereunder to one or more of its Affiliates and (b)
designate one or more of its Affiliates to perform its obligations hereunder,
in each case, so long as Buyer is not relieved of any Liability hereunder.
Except as expressly set forth in Section 6.14, this Agreement is for the sole
benefit of the Parties and their permitted successors and assignees and
nothing herein expressed or implied will give or be construed to give any
Person, other than the Parties and such successors and assignees, any legal or
equitable rights hereunder, including any rights of employment for any
specified period, under or by reason of this Agreement. 

 

12.3.Amendments and Waivers. No amendment or waiver of any provision of this
Agreement will be valid and binding unless it is in writing and signed, in the
case of an amendment, by Buyer and the Stockholders' Representative or in the
case of a waiver, by the

 

-83-

  Party (in the case of the Signatory Stockholders, the Stockholders'
Representative) against whom the waiver is to be effective. No waiver by any
Party of any breach or violation or, default under or inaccuracy in any
representation, warranty or covenant hereunder, whether intentional or not,
will be deemed to extend to any prior or subsequent breach, violation, default
of, or inaccuracy in, any such representation, warranty or covenant hereunder
or affect in any way any rights arising by virtue of any prior or subsequent
such occurrence. No delay or omission on the part of any Party in exercising
any right, power or remedy under this Agreement will operate as a waiver
thereof.

 

12.4.Provisions Concerning Stockholders' Representative.

 

12.4.1.Appointment. By virtue of the approval and adoption of this Agreement
by the requisite consent of the Company Stockholders, each of the Company
Stockholders (other than such Company Stockholders, if any, who have perfected
dissenters' or appraisal rights under Delaware law) shall be deemed to have
agreed to appoint Ampersand 2011 Limited Partnership as the agent, proxy and
attorney-in-fact for and on behalf of the Company Securityholders for all
purposes under this Agreement (including full power and authority to act on
the Company Securityholders' behalf). Without limiting the generality of the
foregoing, the Stockholders' Representative will be authorized to:

 

(a)in connection with the Closing, execute and receive all documents,
instruments, certificates, statements and agreements on behalf of and in the
name of the Company Securityholders necessary to effectuate the Closing and
consummate the Contemplated Transactions;

 

(b)authorize delivery to Buyer of the Adjustment Escrow Amount, or any portion
thereof, pursuant to Section 2.14.5.(a);

 

(c)take all actions on behalf of the Company Securityholders in connection
with any claims made under Article X to defend or settle such claims, and to
make payments in respect of such claims;

 

(d)execute and deliver, should it elect to do so in its sole discretion, on
behalf of the Company Securityholders, any amendment to this Agreement so long
as such amendment will apply equally to all Company Securityholders; and

 

(e)take all other actions to be taken by or on behalf of the Company
Securityholders and exercise any and all rights which the Company
Securityholders are permitted or required to do or exercise under this
Agreement.

 

12.4.2.Liability. The Stockholders' Representative will not be liable to any
Company Securityholder for any action taken by it in good faith pursuant to
this Agreement, and the Company Securityholders will jointly and severally
indemnify the Stockholders' Representative from any Losses arising out of its
serving as the Stockholders' Representative hereunder. The Stockholders'
Representative is serving in that capacity solely for purposes of
administrative convenience, and is not personally liable in such capacity for
any of the obligations of the Company Securityholders hereunder, and Buyer
agrees that it will not look to the personal assets of the Stockholders'
Representative, acting in such capacity, for the satisfaction of any
obligations to be performed by the Company Securityholders hereunder.

 

-84-

  12.4.3.Expense Fund. The Stockholders' Expense Fund Amount shall be used to
fund any Stockholders' Representative expenses incurred by the Stockholders'
Representative in the performance of its duties and obligations hereunder. The
Stockholders' Representative is not providing any investment supervision,
recommendations or advice and shall have no responsibility or liability for
any loss of principal of the Stockholders' Expense Fund Amount other than as a
result of its willful misconduct, bad faith, gross negligence or fraud. The
Stockholders' Representative is not acting as a withholding agent or in any
similar capacity in connection with the Stockholders' Expense Fund Amount, and
has no tax reporting or income distribution obligations. The Company
Securityholders are not entitled to any interest on the Stockholders' Expense
Fund Amount. The Stockholders' Representative may contribute funds to the
Stockholders' Expense Fund Amount from any consideration otherwise
distributable to the Company Securityholders. The Stockholders' Expense Fund
Amount will be held by the Stockholders' Representative until such time as the
Stockholders' Representative determines, in its sole discretion, that the
Securityholders shall have no further expenses to be incurred in connection
with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Any portion of the
Stockholders' Expense Fund Amount remaining after such date shall be paid by
the Stockholders' Representative to the Paying Agent for further distribution
to the Company Securityholders, with each receiving its Pro Rata Share of such
remaining amounts; provided that the amount payable in respect of Company
Options shall be paid through the Surviving Corporation's payroll. For all
Tax purposes, the Parties agree that the Stockholders' Expense Fund shall be
treated as having been received, including through the Surviving Corporation's
payroll, as applicable, and voluntarily set aside by Company Securityholders
at the time of Closing (and any Tax withholding with respect to such deemed
receipt by any Company Securityholders shall be satisfied from the portion of
the Merger Consideration paid to such Company Securityholder at Closing before
reducing the Stockholders' Expense Fund).

 

12.5.Entire Agreement. This Agreement, together with the other Ancillary
Agreements and any documents, instruments and certificates explicitly referred
to herein, constitutes the entire agreement among the Parties with respect to
the subject matter hereof and supersedes any and all prior discussions,
negotiations, proposals, undertakings, understandings and agreements, whether
written or oral, with respect thereto.

 

12.6.Counterparts. This Agreement may be executed in any number of
counterparts, each of which will be deemed an original, but all of which
together will constitute but one and the same instrument. This Agreement will
become effective when duly executed by each Party hereto.

 

12.7.Severability. Any term or provision of this Agreement that is invalid or
unenforceable in any situation in any jurisdiction will not affect the
validity or enforceability of the remaining terms and provisions hereof or the
validity or enforceability of the offending term or provision in any other
situation or in any other jurisdiction. In the event that any provision
hereof would, under applicable Legal Requirements, be invalid or unenforceable
in any respect, each Party hereto intends that such provision will be
construed by modifying or limiting it so as to be valid and enforceable to the
maximum extent compatible with, and possible under, applicable Legal
Requirements.

 

12.8.Headings. The headings contained in this Agreement are for convenience
purposes only and will not in any way affect the meaning or interpretation
hereof.

 

12.9.Construction. The Parties have participated jointly in the negotiation
and drafting of this Agreement. In the event an ambiguity or question of
intent or interpretation arises, this Agreement will be construed as if
drafted jointly by the Parties and no presumption or burden of

 

-85-

  proof will arise favoring or disfavoring any Party by virtue of the authorship
of any of the provisions of this Agreement. The Parties intend that each
representation, warranty and covenant contained herein will have independent
significance. If any Party has breached or violated, or if there is an
inaccuracy in, any representation, warranty or covenant contained herein in
any respect, the fact that there exists another representation, warranty or
covenant relating to the same subject matter (regardless of the relative

-87-

  12.14.2.Buyer hereby consents and agrees to, and agrees to cause the Surviving
Corporation and its Subsidiaries to consent and agree to, Sellers' Counsel
representing the Signatory Stockholders and the Stockholders' Representative
after the Closing, including with respect to disputes in which the interests
of the Stockholders' Representative and/or Signatory Stockholders may be
directly adverse to Buyer and its Subsidiaries (including the Surviving
Corporation and its Subsidiaries), and even though Sellers' Counsel may have
represented the Acquired Companies and their Subsidiaries in a manner
substantially related to any such dispute, or may be handling ongoing matters
for the Acquired Companies. Buyer further consents and agrees to, and agrees
to cause the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries to consent and agree
to, the communication by Sellers' Counsel to the Stockholders' Representative
in connection with any such representation of any fact known to Sellers'
Counsel arising by reason of Sellers' Counsel's prior representation of the
Acquired Companies.

 

12.14.3.In connection with the foregoing, Buyer hereby irrevocably waives and
agrees not to assert, and agrees to cause the Surviving Corporation and its
Subsidiaries to irrevocably waive and not to assert, any conflict of interest
arising from or in connection with (i) Sellers' Counsel's prior representation
of the Acquired Companies and (ii) Sellers' Counsel's representation of the
Signatory Stockholders and Stockholders' Representative prior to and after the
Closing.

 

12.14.4.Buyer further agrees, on behalf of itself and, after the Closing, on
behalf of the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries, that all
communications in any form or format whatsoever between (a) Sellers' Counsel
and (b) any of the Acquired Companies, the Stockholders' Representative and/or
any Company Stockholder, or any of their respective directors, officers,
employees or other Representatives that (x) relate in any way to the
negotiation, documentation and consummation of the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement or dispute arising under this Agreement and (y) are subject
to attorney-client privilege as a result of the Sellers' Counsel's attorney-
client relationship with any Person described in clause (b) above
(collectively, the "Privileged Deal Communications") shall remain privileged
after the Closing and the privilege and expectation of client confidence
relating thereto shall belong solely to the Stockholders' Representative and
the Company Stockholders, shall be controlled by the Stockholders'
Representative on behalf of the Company Stockholders and shall not pass to or
be claimed by Buyer, the Surviving Corporation or any of its Subsidiaries.

 

12.14.5.Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event that a dispute arises
between Buyer, the Surviving Corporation or any of its Subsidiaries, on the
one hand, and a third party other than the Stockholders' Representative, on
the other hand, Buyer, the Surviving Corporation or any of its Subsidiaries
may assert attorney-client privilege to prevent the disclosure of the
Privileged Deal Communications to such third party; provided, however, that
none of Buyer, the Surviving Corporation or any of its Subsidiaries may waive
such privilege without the prior written consent of the Stockholders'
Representative, not to be unreasonable withheld or delayed. In the event that
Buyer, the Surviving Corporation or any of its Subsidiaries is legally
required by the order of any Governmental Authority or otherwise to disclose
all or a portion of the Privileged Deal Communications, Buyer shall
immediately (and, in any event, within two (2) Business Days) notify the
Stockholders' Representative in writing (making specific reference to this
Section 12.14.5)) so that the Stockholders' Representative can seek a
protective order, and Buyer agrees to use all commercially reasonable efforts
to assist therewith.

 

-88-

  12.14.6.To the extent that files or other materials maintained by Sellers'
Counsel constitute property of its clients, on the Stockholders'
Representative shall hold such property rights and Sellers' Counsel shall have
no duty to reveal or disclose of any such files or other materials or any
Privileged Deal Communications by reason of any attorney-client relationship
between Sellers' Counsel, on the one hand, and Buyer or the Acquired
Companies, on the other hand.

 

12.14.7.Buyer agrees that it will not, and that it will cause the Surviving
Corporation and its Subsidiaries, and any of their respective directors,
officers or employees not to, (i) intentionally access or use the Privileged
Deal Communications, (ii) request that the Stockholders' Representative waive
the attorney-client privilege with respect to the Privileged Deal
Communications or (iii) seek to obtain the Privileged Deal Communications from
Sellers' Counsel. In furtherance of the foregoing, it shall not be a breach
of any provision of this Agreement if, prior to the Closing, the Acquired
Companies, the Stockholders' Representative and/or any Signatory Stockholder,
or any of their respective directors, officers, employees or other
Representatives takes any action to remove from the premises of the Acquired
Companies (or any offsite back-up or other facilities), export or otherwise
take possession of any Privileged Deal Communications; provided that (x) prior
written notice shall be provided to Buyer setting forth in reasonable detail
the location to which any Privileged Deal Communications will be transferred
and the Person or Persons who will take possession thereof and (y) in no event
shall the Acquired Companies, the Stockholders' Representative and/or any
Signatory Stockholder, or any of their respective directors, officers,
employees or other Representatives, delete, erase or destroy, or alter the
content of, any Privileged Deal Communications (any such action, subject to
the forgoing proviso, a "Permitted Removal"). In the event that,
notwithstanding any good faith attempts by the Stockholders Representative or
any Company Stockholder, or any of their respective directors, officers,
employees or other Representatives, to achieve a Permitted Removal of any
Privileged Deal Communication, any copy, backup, image, or other form or
version of electronic vestige of any portion of such Privileged Deal
Communication remains accessible to or discoverable or retrievable by Buyer
(together, the "Residual Privileged Deal Communications"), Buyer agrees that
any such Residual Privileged Deal Communications shall continue to be treated
as Privileged Deal Communications for purposes of this Section 12.14.

 

12.15.Translation of Currencies. Unless otherwise specified in this
Agreement, all references to currency, monetary values and dollars set forth
herein shall mean United States (U.S.) dollars and all payments hereunder
shall be made in United States dollars. To the extent the Parties need to
convert currencies for purposes of determining the Company Working Capital,
Company Cash, Company Transaction Expenses or Company Debt, or any component
thereof, the relevant exchange rate shall be determined based on the rate in
effect as of the relevant time of calculation set forth in the definition
thereof, in each case as published on Oanda.com.

  Exhibit A

 

ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES

 

For purposes of this Agreement, the Accounting Principles applied for purposes
of Section 2.14 hereof, including in connection with the preparation of the
Estimated Closing Balance Sheet, Estimated Closing Statement, Closing Balance
Sheet and Closing Statement and the determinations and calculations contained
therein, shall be subject to the following specific principles and policies:

 

    



 |  

1.

 |  

The Accounting Principles shall be applied on the basis that the Company is a
going concern and shall exclude the effect of change of control or ownership
of the Company and will not take into account the effects of any post-Closing
reorganizations or the post-Closing intentions, actions or obligations of
Buyer. 

---|---|--- 

 

    



 |  

2.

 |  

All determinations and calculations of shall be made so as to avoid double
counting (whether positive or negative) of any item or any duplicative
additions to, or subtractions from, the Merger Consideration. 

---|---|--- 

 

    



 |  

3.

 |  

Subject to any other specific policies in this Exhibit, in calculating the
Company Working Capital, there shall be no change in (a) the classification to
a current asset of any particular asset that has not been characterized in the
latest balance sheet included in the Financials as a current asset, or (b) the
classification to a long-term liability of any particular liability that has
not been characterized in the latest balance sheet included in the Financials
as a long-term liability (in each case, other than any such changes resulting
solely from the passage of time between the date hereof and immediately prior
to the Closing). 

---|---|--- 

 

    



 |  

4.

 |  

All calculations and determinations with respect to Taxes shall be made in
accordance with applicable Legal Requirements. 

---|---|--- 

 

    



 |  

5.

 |  

The Accounting Principles shall require presentation on a management basis,
and need not comply with GAAP with respect to presentation. 

---|---|--- 

 

For the avoidance of doubt, for purposes of applying the Accounting Principles
as required under this Agreement, the principles and policies set forth in
paragraphs (1)-(4) of this Exhibit shall take precedence over GAAP.
