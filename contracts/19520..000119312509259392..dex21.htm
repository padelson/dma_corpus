iii AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER

This AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER, dated as of December 20, 2009 (this "
_Agreement_ "), is among SANOFI-AVENTIS, a French  _soci ete anonyme_ ("
_Parent_ "), RIVER ACQUISITION CORP., a newly-formed Tennessee corporation and
an indirect wholly-owned Subsidiary of Parent (" _Merger Sub_ "), and CHATTEM,
INC., a Tennessee corporation (the " _Company_ "). Capitalized terms used in
this Agreement are as defined in Section 8.12.

WHEREAS, it is proposed that, on the terms and subject to the conditions set
forth in this Agreement, Merger Sub shall commence a cash tender offer (such
tender offer, as it may be extended, amended and supplemented from time to
time as permitted by this Agreement, the " _Offer_ ") to purchase all of the
issued and outstanding shares of common stock, without par value, of the
Company (the " _Company Common Stock_ "), together with the associated
Company Rights, at a price per share equal to $93.50, net to the sellers in
cash (such amount or any greater amount per share paid pursuant to the Offer,
the " _Offer Price_ ");

WHEREAS, it is proposed that, on the terms and subject to the conditions set
forth in this Agreement, following the consummation of the Offer, Merger Sub
shall merge with and into the Company with the Company surviving as an
indirect wholly-owned Subsidiary of Parent (the " _Merger_ "), pursuant to
which each outstanding share of Company Common Stock shall be converted into
the right to receive the Offer Price, except for shares of Company Common
Stock to be canceled pursuant to Section 2.7(b);

WHEREAS, the Board of Directors of the Company has authorized and adopted this
Agreement and resolved that the Transactions, including the consummation of
the Offer and the Merger, upon the terms and subject to the conditions set
forth in this Agreement and in accordance with the relevant provisions of the
Tennessee Business Corporation Act (the " _TBCA_ ") are advisable, fair to and
in the best interests of the Company and the Company Shareholders;

WHEREAS in connection with the Merger Agreement and the Transactions, Parent
has entered into letter agreements with certain employees of the Company
regarding retention matters;

WHEREAS, the Board of Directors of Parent has authorized the consummation of
the Transactions;

WHEREAS, the Board of Directors of Merger Sub has authorized and adopted this
Agreement and resolved that the Transactions, including the consummation of
the Offer and the Merger, upon the terms and subject to the conditions set
forth in this Agreement and in accordance with the relevant provisions of the
TBCA are advisable and in the best interests of Merger Sub and its
shareholder; and

WHEREAS, the Board of Directors of the Company resolved to recommend that the
holders of Company Common Stock (the " _Company Shareholders_ ") accept the
Offer, tender their shares of Company Common Stock in the Offer, and, to the
extent required by applicable Law, approve the Merger and this Agreement, in
each case, upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this
Agreement. NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the representations, warranties, covenants
and agreements contained in this Agreement, the receipt and adequacy of which
are acknowledged, and intending to be legally bound, Parent, Merger Sub and
the Company agree as follows:

ARTICLE I

_THE OFFER_

Section 1.1 _The Offer_.

(a) Provided that this Agreement shall not have been terminated in accordance
with Article VII, the conditions set forth in Annex A (other than clauses (a),
(b) or (f) of Annex A) shall have been satisfied, or if permissible under
applicable Law, waived (the conditions set forth in Annex A, the " _Tender
Offer Conditions_ "), and the Company shall have complied with its obligations
under Section 1.2 hereof, Merger Sub shall, and Parent shall cause Merger Sub
to, commence (within the meaning of Rule 14d-2 under the U.S. Securities
Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (together with its rules and regulations, the
" _Exchange Act_ ")) the Offer, as promptly as reasonably practicable after
the date of this Agreement and in any event within fifteen (15) Business Days
after the date of this Agreement. Parent and Merger Sub expressly reserve the
right to waive any of the Tender Offer Conditions, to increase the Offer
Price or to make any other changes in the terms and conditions of the Offer;
_provided_ that, without the prior written consent of the Company, Parent and
Merger Sub shall not:

(i) decrease the Offer Price or change the form of consideration payable in
the Offer;

(ii) decrease the number of shares of Company Common Stock sought to be
purchased in the Offer;

(iii) impose conditions on the Offer in addition to the Tender Offer
Conditions or amend any condition in a manner adverse to the holders of
Common Stock;

(iv) waive or amend the Minimum Condition;

(v) amend any other term of the Offer in a manner adverse to the Company
Shareholders; or

(vi) extend the Expiration Date except as required or permitted by this
Section 1.1.

The Company agrees that no shares of Company Common Stock held by the Company
or any of its Subsidiaries will be tendered in the Offer.



 

2 (b) Merger Sub shall file with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission
(the " _SEC_ ") a Tender Offer Statement on Schedule TO with respect to the
Offer on the date that the Offer is commenced, which Tender Offer Statement
shall include an offer to purchase, letter of transmittal and summary
advertisement and other required ancillary offer documents (such Schedule TO
and the documents included therein pursuant to which the Offer will be made,
together with any supplements or amendments thereto, the " _Offer Documents_
") and cause the Offer Documents to be disseminated to the Company
Shareholders in accordance with the applicable requirements of the Exchange
Act. The Company, Parent and Merger Sub each agree promptly to correct any
information provided by it for use in the Offer Documents if and to the
extent that it shall have become false or misleading in any material respect,
and Parent and Merger Sub further agree to take all steps necessary to cause
the Offer Documents as so corrected to be filed with the SEC and disseminated
to the Company Shareholders to the extent required by applicable Law. The
Company and its counsel shall be given a reasonable opportunity to review and
comment on the Offer Documents each time before any such document is filed
with the SEC, and Parent and Merger Sub shall give reasonable and good faith
consideration to any comments made by the Company and its counsel. Parent and
Merger Sub shall provide the Company and its counsel with (i) any comments or
other communications, whether written or oral, that Parent, Merger Sub or
their counsel may receive from time to time from the SEC or its staff with
respect to the Offer Documents promptly after receipt of those comments or
other communications and (ii) a reasonable opportunity to participate in the
response of Parent and Merger Sub to those comments and to provide comments on
that response (to which reasonable and good faith consideration shall be
given), including by participating with Parent and Merger Sub or their
counsel in any discussions or meetings with the SEC or its staff.

(c) Subject to the terms and conditions set forth in the Offer Documents, the
Offer shall remain open until midnight, New York City time, at the end of the
twentieth (20th) Business Day (for this purpose calculated in accordance with
Rule 14d-1(g)(3) under the Exchange Act) after the date that the Offer is
commenced (the " _Initial Expiration Date_ ") or if the period of time for
which the Offer is open shall have been extended pursuant to, and in
accordance with, this Section 1.1(c) or as may be required by applicable Law,
the time and date to which the Offer has been so extended (the Initial
Expiration Date or such later time and date to which the Offer has been
extended in accordance with this Section 1.1(c), the " _Expiration Date_ ").
Notwithstanding the foregoing, (i) if, on the Expiration Date, any of the
Tender Offer Conditions are not satisfied or waived, then, to the extent
requested in writing by the Company no less than two (2) Business Days prior
to the Expiration Date, Merger Sub shall, and Parent shall cause Merger Sub
to, extend the Offer from time to time for one (1) or more periods of time up
to ten (10) Business Days per extension until such condition(s) has
been satisfied or waived; _provided_ , that Merger Sub shall not be required
to extend the Offer beyond April 30, 2010 (the " _Outside Date_ "); _provided_
, _further_ , that if the only Tender Offer Condition which has not been
satisfied as of the Outside Date is the Regulatory Condition, the Outside Date
shall be May 30, 2010, and (ii) Merger Sub shall, and Parent shall cause
Merger Sub to, extend the Offer for any period required by any rule,
regulation, interpretation or position of the SEC or its staff applicable to
the Offer or necessary to resolve any comments of the SEC or its staff
applicable to the Offer or the Offer Documents. Merger Sub shall not extend
the Offer if all of the Tender Offer Conditions are satisfied or waived and
it is permitted under applicable Law to accept for payment and pay for
tendered shares.



 

3 (d) Subject to the terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement and to
satisfaction or waiver of the Tender Offer Conditions, Merger Sub shall, and
Parent shall cause it to, as soon as practicable after the Expiration Date,
accept for payment and pay for all shares of Company Common Stock that have
been validly tendered and not validly withdrawn pursuant to the Offer. If all
of the Tender Offer Conditions are satisfied but the number of shares of
Company Common Stock that have been validly tendered and not validly withdrawn
in the Offer and accepted for payment, together with any shares of Company
Common Stock then owned by Parent or any of its Subsidiaries, is less than 90%
of the shares of Company Common Stock then outstanding on a fully-diluted
basis (on a "fully-diluted basis" meaning the number of shares of Company
Common Stock then issued and outstanding plus all shares of Company Common
Stock which the Company may be required to issue as of such date pursuant to
options (whether or not then vested or exercisable), warrants (only to
the extent then exercisable or exercisable as a result of the Transactions),
rights, convertible or exchangeable securities (only to the extent then
convertible or exchangeable into shares of Company Common Stock) or similar
obligations then outstanding), Merger Sub may, without the consent of the
Company, commence a subsequent offering period (as provided in Rule 14d-11
under the Exchange Act) for three (3) to twenty (20) Business Days to acquire
outstanding untendered shares of Company Common Stock. If Merger Sub
commences a subsequent offering period in connection with the Offer, Merger
Sub shall accept for payment and pay for all additional shares of Company
Common Stock validly tendered during such subsequent offering period.

Section 1.2 _Company Action_.

(a) The Board of Directors of the Company, at a meeting duly called and held,
has, subject to the terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement,
unanimously:

(i) Determined that this Agreement and the Transactions are advisable, fair to
and in the best interests of the Company and the Company Shareholders;

(ii) Adopted this Agreement and the Transactions, in all respects, and such
adoption constitutes adoption of the Transactions for purposes of the
applicable provisions of the TBCA and the Company Rights Plan; and

(iii) Resolved to recommend that the Company Shareholders accept the Offer,
tender their shares of Company Common Stock in the Offer, and, to the extent
required by applicable Law, approve the Merger and this Agreement (the "
_Company Recommendation_ ").

(b) The Company shall file with the SEC, on the day that the Offer is
commenced, a Solicitation/Recommendation Statement on Schedule 14D-9
pertaining to the Offer (together with any amendments or supplements thereto,
the " _Schedule 14D-9_ ") that, subject to Section 5.3(b), contains the
Company Recommendation and shall promptly mail the Schedule 14D-9 to the
Company Shareholders together with the Offer Documents as required by Rule
14d-9 under the Exchange Act. The Company, Parent and Merger Sub each agree
promptly to correct any information provided by it for use in the Schedule
14D-9 if and to the extent that it shall have become false or misleading in
any material respect, and the Company further agrees to take all steps
necessary to cause the Schedule 14D-9 as so corrected to be filed with the SEC
and 



 

4  disseminated to the Company Shareholders to the extent required by
applicable Law. Parent and Merger Sub shall as promptly as reasonably
practicable furnish to the Company all information concerning Parent and
Merger Sub that is required or reasonably requested by the Company for
inclusion in the Schedule 14D-9. Parent, Merger Sub and their counsel shall be
given a reasonable opportunity to review and comment on the Schedule
14D-9 sufficiently in advance of its filing with the SEC (including any
amendments or supplements thereto). The Company shall provide Parent, Merger
Sub and their counsel with (i) any comments or other communications, whether
written or oral, that the Company or its counsel may receive from time to
time from the SEC or its staff with respect to the Schedule 14D-9 or otherwise
related to the Transactions promptly after receipt of those comments or other
communications and (ii) a reasonable opportunity to participate in the
response of the Company to those comments and to provide comments on that
response (to which reasonable and good faith consideration shall be given),
including by participating with the Company or its counsel in any discussions
or meetings with the SEC or its staff.

(c) In connection with the Offer, the Company shall promptly furnish (or
cause its transfer agent to promptly furnish) Parent and Merger Sub with
mailing labels, security position listings and any available listing or
computer files containing the names and addresses of the Company Shareholders,
each as of the most recent practicable date, and shall promptly furnish
Merger Sub with such additional information and assistance (including updated
lists of the Company Shareholders, mailing labels and lists of securities
positions) as Merger Sub or its agents may reasonably request in order to
communicate the Offer to the Company Shareholders. Except as required by
applicable Law, and except as necessary to communicate regarding the
Transactions with the Company Shareholders, Parent and Merger Sub (and their
respective Representatives) shall hold in confidence the information contained
in any such labels, listings and files, shall use such information solely in
connection with the Transactions, and, if this Agreement is terminated or
the Offer is otherwise terminated, shall promptly deliver or cause to be
delivered to the Company or destroy all copies of such information, labels,
listings and files then in their possession or in the possession of their
Representatives.

 

(d) The Company shall as promptly as reasonably practicable furnish to Parent
and Merger Sub all information concerning the Company that may be required or
reasonably requested by Parent or Merger Sub for inclusion in the Offer
Documents.

Section 1.3  _Top-Up Option_.

(a) The Company grants to Parent an irrevocable option (the " _Top-Up Option_
") to purchase from the Company up to that number of newly issued shares of
Company Common Stock (the " _Top-Up Option Shares_ ") equal to the number of
shares of Company Common Stock that, when added to the number of shares of
Company Common Stock owned by Parent or any of its Subsidiaries at the time
of exercise of the Top-Up Option, would constitute one (1) share more than
ninety percent (90%) of the shares of Company Common Stock then outstanding on
a fully-diluted basis (on a "fully-diluted basis" meaning the number of
shares of Company Common Stock then issued and outstanding plus all shares of
Company Common Stock which the Company may be required to issue as of such
date pursuant to options (whether or not then vested or exercisable),
warrants (only to the extent then exercisable or exercisable as a result of
the Transactions), rights, convertible or exchangeable securities (only to the
extent 



 

5  then convertible or exchangeable into shares of Company Common Stock) or
similar obligations then outstanding, after giving effect to the issuance of
the Top-Up Option Shares) (the " _Short Form Threshold_ ") for consideration
per Top-Up Option Share equal to the Offer Price. Parent may assign the Top-Up
Option and its rights and obligations pursuant to this Section 1.3, in its
sole discretion, to any of its Subsidiaries, including Merger Sub.

(b) The Top-Up Option may be exercised in whole or in part; _provided_ ,
_however_ , the Top-Up Option shall not be exercisable to the extent (i) the
number of shares of Company Common Stock subject to the Top-Up Option exceeds
the number of authorized shares of Company Common Stock available for
issuance, (ii) any Restraint shall prohibit the exercise or delivery of the
Top-Up Option, (iii) immediately after such exercise and issuance of shares of
Company Common Stock pursuant thereto, the Short Form Threshold would not be
reached, or (iv) Merger Sub has not accepted for payment all shares of
Company Common Stock validly tendered in the Offer (or during any subsequent
offering period) and not validly withdrawn.

(c) In the event that Parent wishes to exercise the Top-Up Option, Parent
shall give the Company written notice specifying the number of shares of
Company Common Stock that are or will be owned by Parent or any of its
Subsidiaries immediately following the Acceptance Time and specifying a place
and a time for the closing of the purchase. The Company shall, as soon as
practicable following receipt of such notice, deliver written notice to
Parent specifying the number of Top-Up Option Shares. At the closing of the
purchase of the Top-Up Option Shares, (i) Parent shall pay (or cause to be
paid) to the Company an amount equal to the product of (x) the number of
shares of Company Common Stock purchased pursuant to the Top-Up Option and
(y) the Offer Price, which amount may be paid, at the election of Parent,
either in cash (by wire transfer or cashiers check) or by delivery of a
promissory note, and (ii) the Company shall cause the Top-Up Option Shares to
be issued to Parent (or any of its Subsidiaries designated by Parent),
represented by either certificates or book-entry shares, at the sole option of
Parent. Prior to the closing of the purchase of the Top-Up Option Shares,
upon Parents request, the Company shall cause its transfer agent to certify
in writing to Parent the number of shares of Company Common Stock issued and
outstanding as of immediately prior to the exercise of the Top-Up Option and
after giving effect to the issuance of the Top-Up Option Shares.

(d) Parent acknowledges that the Top-Up Option Shares which Parent (or any of
its Subsidiaries) may acquire upon exercise of the Top-Up Option shall not be
registered under the U.S. Securities Act of 1933, as amended (including its
rules and regulations, the " _Securities Act_ "), and shall be issued in
reliance upon an exemption for transactions not involving a public offering.
Parent agrees that the Top-Up Option, and the Top-Up Option Shares to be
acquired upon exercise of the Top-Up Option, if any, are being and shall
be acquired by Parent (or any of its Subsidiaries) for the purpose of
investment and not with a view to, or for resale in connection with, any
distribution thereof (within the meaning of the Securities Act).

Section 1.4 _Board of Directors_.

(a) Subject to compliance with applicable Law, promptly upon the acceptance
for payment of shares of Company Common Stock by Parent or Merger Sub or any 



 

6  of their Affiliates pursuant to and in accordance with the terms of the
Offer (the " _Acceptance Time_ ") and from time to time thereafter, and
subject to Section 1.4(c), Parent shall be entitled to designate up to four
directors (the " _Parent Designees_ "), and the Company shall, upon Parents
request, (i) cause the resignation of such number of directors as is necessary
to enable the Parent Designees to be elected or designated to the Board of
Directors of the Company and to cause the Parent Designees to be so elected or
so designated (the date on which the Parent Designees have been effectively
appointed to the Board of Directors of the Company in accordance herewith,
the " _Board Appointment Date_ "); _provided_ that the Parent Designees shall
be split among the classes of the Board of Directors of the Company so that
the classes are as even as possible and (ii) amend its by-laws to provide
that (A) any act of the Board of Directors requires the affirmative vote of at
least a majority of the directors constituting the entire Board of Directors
and (B) at least 50% of directors present for the purposes of determining a
quorum at any meeting of the Board of Directors or any committee thereof must
be Parent Designees. Subject to Section 1.4(c), the Company will cause Parent
Designees to constitute such number of members of each committee of the Board
of Directors of the Company, rounded up to the next whole number, that
represents the same percentage as such individuals represent on the Board of
Directors of the Company.

(b) If requested by Parent, the Company shall take all action to file with the
SEC an Information Statement pursuant to Section 14(f) of the Exchange Act
and Rule 14f-1 under the Exchange Act (the " _14(f) Information Statement_ "),
as soon as reasonably practicable after the availability of all information
required thereby. Parent shall provide to the Company, and shall be solely
responsible for, the information and consents with respect to Parent and its
designees, officers, directors and affiliates required by Section 14(f) of the
Exchange Act and Rule 14f-1 under the Exchange Act. In connection with filing
the 14(f) Information Statement, Parent shall be entitled to designate up to
such number of directors, rounded up to the next whole number constituting at
least a majority of the directors, on the Board of Directors of the Company as
will give Parent representation on the Board of Directors of the Company
equal to the product of (i) the number of directors on the Board of Directors
of the Company (giving effect to the election of any additional directors
pursuant to this Section 1.4) and (ii) the percentage that the number of
shares of Company Common Stock beneficially owned by Parent or its
Subsidiaries bears to the total number of shares of Company Common Stock then
outstanding and the Company shall, upon Parents request, cause the
resignation of such number of directors as is necessary to enable the Parent
designees to be elected or designated to the Board of Directors of the Company
and to cause the Parent designees to be so elected or so designated. The
provisions of Section 1.4(a) are in addition to and shall not limit any rights
that Merger Sub, Parent or any of their Affiliates may have as a holder or
beneficial owner of shares of Company Common Stock as a matter of law with
respect to the election of directors or otherwise.

(c) In the event that the Parent Designees are elected or designated to the
Board of Directors of the Company, then, until the Effective Time, the Company
shall cause the Board of Directors of the Company to have at least two (2)
directors who are (i) directors on the date of this Agreement and (ii)
independent directors for purposes of the continued listing requirements of
the NASDAQ Global Select Market (" _NASDAQ_ ") (such directors, the "
_Independent Directors_ "); _provided_ , _however_ , that if any Independent
Director is unable to serve due to death or disability or any other reason,
the remaining Independent Directors shall be 



 

7  entitled to elect or designate another individual (or individuals) who
serve(s) as a director (or directors) on the date of this Agreement (
_provided_ that no such individual is an employee of the Company or its
Subsidiaries) to fill the vacancy, and such director (or directors) shall be
deemed to be an Independent Director (or Independent Directors) for purposes
of this Agreement. If no Independent Director remains prior to the Effective
Time, a majority of the members of the Board of Directors of the Company at
the time of the execution of this Agreement shall be entitled to designate two
(2) individuals to fill such vacancies; _provided_ that such
individuals shall not be employees of or otherwise affiliated with the
Company, Parent or Merger Sub, and such individuals shall be deemed
Independent Directors for purposes of this Agreement. Following the Acceptance
Time and prior to the Effective Time, Parent and Merger Sub shall not cause
any amendment or termination of this Agreement, any extension by the Company
of the time for the performance of any of the obligations of Merger Sub or
Parent, waiver of any of the Companys rights under this Agreement or any
other action adversely affecting the rights of the Company Shareholders (other
than Parent or Merger Sub) to be effected without the affirmative vote of a
majority of the Independent Directors. Following the Acceptance Time
and prior to the Effective Time, neither Parent nor Merger Sub shall take any
action to remove any Independent Director unless the removal shall be for
cause.

executed in accordance with, and in such form as is required by, the TBCA (the

effective date of the Articles of Merger (the " _Effective Time_ ").



 

8 Section 2.4 _Effects of the Merger_. The Merger shall have the effects set
forth in this Agreement, the Articles of Merger and the applicable provisions
of the TBCA. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, and subject
thereto, at the Effective Time, all the properties, rights, privileges,
immunities, powers and franchises of the Company and Merger Sub shall vest in
the Surviving Corporation, and all debts, liabilities and duties of the
Company and Merger Sub shall become the debts, liabilities and duties of the
Surviving Corporation.

Section 2.5 _Charter and By-laws of the Surviving Corporation_. Unless
otherwise agreed by Parent and the Company, the charter and by-laws of the
Company, as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time, shall be the
charter and by-laws of the Surviving Corporation until thereafter amended as
provided therein or by applicable Law and subject to Section 5.7 hereof. 

Section 2.6 _Directors and Officers of the Surviving Corporation_. From and
after the Effective Time, the directors of Merger Sub immediately prior to
the Effective Time shall be the directors of the Surviving Corporation until
the earlier of their death, resignation or removal or until their respective

From and after the Effective Time, the officers of the Company immediately
prior to the Effective Time shall be the officers of the Surviving Corporation
until the earlier of their death, resignation or removal or until

Section 2.7 _Effect on Capital Stock_. At the Effective Time, by virtue of
the Merger and without any action on the part of Parent, Merger Sub, the
Company or the holders of any shares of Company Common Stock or any shares of
capital stock of Merger Sub:

(a) _Common Stock of Merger Sub_. Each share of common stock, without par
value, of Merger Sub issued and outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time shall be converted into one (1) validly issued, fully paid and
nonassessable share of common stock, without par value, of the Surviving
Corporation and shall constitute the only outstanding shares of the
Surviving Corporation. From and after the Effective Time, all certificates,
if any, representing shares of capital stock of Merger Sub shall be deemed for
all purposes to represent the number of shares of common stock of the
Surviving Corporation into which they were converted in accordance with the
immediately preceding sentence.

(b) _Cancellation of Certain Shares_. Each share of Company Common Stock
which is owned by the Company or Parent or by any Subsidiary of Parent,
including Merger Sub, shall be canceled without any conversion, and no
consideration shall be delivered in respect thereof. Each share of
Company Common Stock which is owned by any Subsidiary of the Company shall
remain outstanding, with appropriate adjustment to the number thereof to
preserve such Subsidiarys relative ownership percentage in the Company.

(c) _Conversion of Company Common Stock_. Each share of Company Common Stock
issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than
shares to be canceled, or to remain outstanding, in accordance with Section
2.7(b)) shall be converted into the right to receive an amount of cash,
without interest, equal to the Offer Price (the " _Merger Consideration_ "),
subject to any required withholding of Taxes. As of the Effective 



 

9  Time, all such shares of Company Common Stock shall no longer be outstanding
and shall automatically be canceled and shall cease to exist, and each holder
of a certificate (or evidence of shares in book-entry form) which immediately
prior to the Effective Time represented any such shares of Company Common
Stock (each, a " _Certificate_ ") shall cease to have any rights with respect
thereto, except the right to receive the Merger Consideration to be paid in
consideration therefor upon surrender of such Certificate in accordance with
Section 2.8(b), without interest.

Section 2.8 _Exchange of Certificates_.

(a) _Paying Agent_. Not less than three (3) Business Days prior to the
Effective Time, Parent shall designate a United States bank or trust company
reasonably acceptable to the Company (the " _Paying Agent_ ") to receive, for
the benefit of the Company Shareholders, funds representing the aggregate
Merger Consideration to which Company Shareholders shall become entitled
pursuant to Section 2.7(c) (the " _Exchange Fund_ "). The Paying Agent shall
also act as the agent for the Company Shareholders for the purpose of holding
the Certificates and shall obtain no rights or interests in the shares
represented by such Certificates. Parent shall deposit or cause to be
deposited cash in an amount sufficient to pay the aggregate Merger
Consideration with the Paying Agent by wire transfer of immediately available
funds at or prior to the Effective Time. The Exchange Fund shall, pending its
disbursement to the Company Shareholders, be invested by the Paying Agent as
directed by Parent. Parent shall promptly replace or cause to be replaced any
funds deposited with the Paying Agent that are lost through any investment.
Earnings from investments shall be the sole and exclusive property of Parent
and the Surviving Corporation, and no part of such earnings shall accrue to
the benefit of the holders of Company Common Stock.

(b) _Payment Procedures_.

(i) Promptly after the Effective Time (but in no event more than five (5)
Business Days thereafter), Parent or the Surviving Corporation shall cause
the Paying Agent to mail to each holder of record of a Certificate whose
shares of the Company Common Stock were converted into the right to receive
the Merger Consideration (A) a letter of transmittal (which shall specify
that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the
Certificates shall pass, only upon proper delivery of the Certificates to the
Paying Agent, and which shall be in such form and shall have such other
customary provisions (including customary provisions with respect to delivery
of an "agents message" with respect to shares held in book-entry form) as
Parent may reasonably specify) and (B) instructions for use in effecting the
surrender of the Certificates in exchange for payment of the Merger
Consideration.

(ii) Upon (A) surrender of a Certificate for cancellation to the Paying
Agent, together with a letter of transmittal, duly completed and validly
executed in accordance with the instructions or (B) receipt of an "agents
message" by the Paying Agent (or such other evidence, if any, of transfer as
the Paying Agent may reasonably request) in the case of a book-entry transfer
of uncertificated shares, and such other customary documents as may reasonably
be required by the Paying Agent, the holder of such Certificate shall be
entitled to receive in exchange therefor the Merger Consideration, without
interest and less any required withholding of Taxes, for each share of Company
Common Stock formerly represented by such Certificate, and the Certificate so
surrendered shall be canceled.



 

10 (iii) If payment of the Merger Consideration is to be made to a Person
other than the Person in whose name the surrendered Certificate is
registered, it shall be a condition precedent of payment that (A) the
Certificate so surrendered shall be properly endorsed or shall otherwise be in
proper form for transfer and (B) the Person requesting such payment shall
have paid any transfer and other Taxes required by reason of the payment of
the Merger Consideration to a Person other than the registered holder of such
Certificate surrendered or shall have established to the reasonable
satisfaction of the Surviving Corporation that such Tax either has been paid
or is not applicable.

(iv) Until surrendered as contemplated by this Section 2.8, each Certificate
shall be deemed at any time after the Effective Time to represent only the
right to receive the Merger Consideration as contemplated by this Article II,
without interest and less any required withholding of Taxes.

(c) _Transfer Books; No Further Ownership Rights in Company Common Stock_.
The Merger Consideration paid in respect of shares of Company Common Stock
upon the surrender for exchange of Certificates in accordance with the terms
of this Article II shall be deemed to have been paid in full satisfaction of
all rights pertaining to the shares of Company Common Stock previously
represented by such Certificates. At the Effective Time, the stock transfer
books of the Company shall be closed and thereafter there shall be no further
registration of transfers on the stock transfer books of the Surviving
Corporation of the shares of Company Common Stock that were outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time. From and after the Effective Time,
the holders of Certificates that evidenced ownership of shares of Company
Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall cease
to have any rights with respect to such shares of Company Common Stock, except
as otherwise provided for in this Agreement or by applicable Law. Subject to
Section 2.8(d), if, at any time after the Effective Time, Certificates are
presented to the Surviving Corporation for any reason, they shall be canceled
and exchanged as provided in this Article II. 

(d) _Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates_. In the event any Certificates
shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, the Paying Agent shall issue in
exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificates, upon the making of
an affidavit of that fact by the holder thereof, such portion of the Merger
Consideration as may be required pursuant to Section 2.7(c); _provided_ ,
_however_ , that the Surviving Corporation may, in its discretion and as a
condition precedent to the issuance thereof, require the owner of such lost,
stolen or destroyed Certificates to deliver an agreement of indemnification
in form reasonably satisfactory to the Surviving Corporation, or a bond in
such sum as the Surviving Corporation may reasonably direct as indemnity,
against any claim that may be made against the Surviving Corporation or the
Paying Agent in respect of the Certificates alleged to have been lost, stolen
or destroyed.

(e) _Termination of Fund_. Any portion of the Exchange Fund (including any
interest or earnings from investments received with respect thereto) which
remains undistributed to the Company Shareholders six (6) months after the
Effective Time shall be delivered to the Surviving Corporation, upon demand,
and any Company Shareholders who 



 

11  have not theretofore complied with this Article II shall thereafter look
only to the Surviving Corporation for payment of their claim for the Merger
Consideration (subject to abandoned property, escheat or other similar Laws)
only as general creditors thereof with respect to the payment of any Merger
Consideration that may be payable upon due surrender of their Certificates, as
determined pursuant to this Agreement without any interest thereon and less
any required withholding of Taxes. Any amounts remaining unclaimed by such
holders at such time at which such amounts would otherwise escheat to or
become property of any Governmental Authority shall become, to the extent
permitted by applicable Law, the property of the Surviving Corporation, free
and clear of all claims or interest of any Person previously entitled thereto.
Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to the contrary, neither
Parent, the Surviving Corporation nor the Paying Agent shall be liable to any
holder of a Certificate for Merger Consideration that was required to be
delivered to a public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property,
escheat or similar Law and was so delivered.

(f) _Withholding Taxes_. The Company, Parent, Merger Sub, the Surviving
Corporation and the Paying Agent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold
from the consideration otherwise payable to a holder of shares of Company
Common Stock or Options pursuant to this Agreement such amounts as may be
required to be deducted and withheld with respect to the making of such
payment under the U.S. Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the " _Code_
"), or under any provision of state, local or foreign Tax Law. To the extent
amounts are so withheld and paid over to the appropriate taxing authority,
such withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as
having been paid to the Person in respect of which such deduction and
withholding was made.

Section 2.9 _Dissenters  Rights_. Dissenters rights under Chapter 23 of the
TBCA are not available to the Company Shareholders for the Transactions.

Section 2.10 _Stock Options_.

(a) On the date on which the Acceptance Time occurs, each then outstanding
unexercised stock option (whether or not then vested or exercisable) that
represents the right to acquire Company Common Stock (each, an " _Option_ ")
shall become fully vested and exercisable in accordance with the terms of such
Option. As of the Effective Time, each then outstanding Option (whether or
not then vested or exercisable) shall be canceled and immediately represent
the right to receive in exchange therefor an amount of cash equal to (i) the
excess, if any, of (A) the Merger Consideration per share of Company Common
Stock over (B) the exercise price per share of Company Common Stock subject to
such Option, multiplied by (ii) the number of shares of Company Common Stock
underlying such Option, which amount shall be paid at the Effective Time
by the Company.

(b) The Board of Directors of the Company shall take all actions reasonably
necessary or appropriate to implement the foregoing provisions of this
Section 2.10, including actions to cancel outstanding awards as provided in
Section 2.10(a) in accordance with the terms of the Company Stock Plans.



 

12 (c) All amounts payable pursuant to Section 2.10(a) shall be subject to any
required withholding Taxes or proof of eligibility for exemption therefrom,
in accordance with Section 2.8(f).

Section 2.11  _Adjustments_. Notwithstanding any provision of this Article II
to the contrary, if between the date of this Agreement and the Effective Time
the outstanding shares of Company Common Stock shall have been changed into a
different number of shares or a different class by reason of the occurrence
or record date of any stock dividend, subdivision, reclassification,
recapitalization, stock split (including a reverse stock split), combination,
exchange of shares or similar transaction, the Merger Consideration shall be
equitably adjusted to reflect such stock dividend, subdivision,
reclassification, recapitalization, stock split (including a reverse stock
split), combination, exchange of shares or similar transaction.

and documents incorporated by reference therein, together with any

basis on Current Reports on Form 8-K, the " _Company SEC Documents_ "). As of

other Company SEC Documents), the Company SEC Documents complied in all
material respects with applicable Law, including the Securities Act, the

regulations, 



 

17  " _SOX_ "), and none of the Company SEC Documents as of such respective
dates contained any untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state a
material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the
statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made,
not misleading, except as set forth in Section 3.7(a) of the Company
Disclosure Letter and to the extent updated, amended, restated or corrected
by a subsequent Company SEC Document filed with the SEC prior to the date of

the Company Subsidiaries is required to file any forms, reports or other
documents with the SEC pursuant to Section 13 or 15 of the Exchange Act.

(b) Except to the extent updated, amended, restated or corrected by a
subsequent Company SEC Document filed with the SEC prior to the date of this
Agreement, each of the consolidated financial statements of the Company
contained in the Company SEC Documents (in each case, together with the notes
and schedules thereto) were prepared in accordance with GAAP (except as may be
indicated in the notes thereto), applied on a consistent basis during
the periods involved (except as may be indicated in the notes thereto) and

the Company and its consolidated Subsidiaries as of the dates thereof and the
consolidated results of their operations and cash flows for the periods then
ended (subject, in the case of the financial statements for any quarter of the
current fiscal year, to normal year-end audit adjustments).

(c) Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries is a party to, or has any
commitment to become a party to, any joint venture, off-balance sheet
partnership or any similar contract (including any contract or arrangement
relating to any transaction or relationship between or among the Company and
any of its Subsidiaries, on the one hand, and any unconsolidated Affiliate,
on the other hand), including any structured finance, special purpose or
limited purpose entity or Person, or any "off-balance sheet arrangements" (as
defined in Item 303(a) of Regulation S-K of the SEC), where the result,
purpose or effect of such contract is to avoid disclosure of any material
transaction involving, or material liabilities of, the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries in the Companys or any of its Subsidiaries published financial
statements or any Company SEC Documents.

(d) Each of the principal executive officer of the Company and the principal
financial officer of the Company (or each former principal executive officer

under the Exchange Act and Sections 302 and 906 of SOX, in each case, with
respect to the Company SEC Documents, and the statements contained in such
certifications were complete, correct and accurate on the date such
certifications were made. For purposes of this Agreement,
"principal executive officer" and "principal financial officer" shall have
the meanings given to such terms in SOX.

(e) The Company has established and maintains a system of "internal control
over financial reporting" (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f)
promulgated by the SEC under the Exchange Act) sufficient to provide
reasonable assurance (i) that transactions 



 

18  are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in
conformity with GAAP, consistently applied, (ii) that transactions are
executed only in accordance with the authorization of management and (iii)
regarding prevention or timely detection of the unauthorized acquisition, use
or disposition of the Companys assets.

(f) The Company has established and maintains "disclosure controls and
procedures" (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) promulgated by the
SEC under the Exchange Act); such disclosure controls and procedures are
reasonably designed to ensure that information relating to the Company and the
Subsidiaries of the Company required to be disclosed in the Companys periodic
reports filed or submitted under the Exchange Act is made known to the
Companys principal executive officer and its principal financial officer by
others within those entities, particularly during the periods in which the
periodic reports required under the Exchange Act are being prepared; and
such disclosure controls and procedures are effective in timely alerting the
Companys principal executive officer and its principal financial officer to
information required to be included in the Company SEC Documents and to ensure
that information required to be disclosed in the Company SEC Documents is
recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the required time periods
specified in the SEC rules and forms and to make the certifications required
pursuant to Sections 302 and 906 of SOX. The Companys principal executive
officer and its principal financial officer have disclosed, based on their
most recent evaluation, to the Companys auditors and the Audit Committee of
the Companys Board of Directors (x) all significant deficiencies in the
design or operation of internal controls which could adversely affect the
Companys ability to record, process, summarize and report financial data and
have identified for the Companys auditors any material weaknesses in
internal controls and (y) any fraud, whether or not material, that involves
management or other employees who have a significant role in the Companys
internal controls. The management of the Company has completed its assessment
of the effectiveness of the Companys internal control over financial
reporting in compliance with the requirements of Section 404 of SOX for the
fiscal year ended November 30, 2008, and such assessment concluded that such
controls were effective. To the Knowledge of the Company, there are no facts
or circumstances that would prevent its chief executive officer and chief
financial officer from giving the certifications and attestations
required pursuant to the rules and regulations adopted pursuant to Section
404 of SOX, without qualification, when next due.

employee, consultant or independent contractor of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries or with respect to which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries

of the Code has been determined by the Internal Revenue Service to be so
qualified and the trusts maintained thereunder have been determined by the
Internal Revenue Service to be exempt from taxation under Section 501(a) of
the Code; _provided_ , _however_ , that such Company Plans and the trusts
maintained thereunder may have been amended after such determinations were
made; _provided_ , _further_ , that nothing has occurred with respect to the
operation of each such Company Plan which could reasonably be expected to
cause the loss of such qualification or exemption or the imposition of any
material liability, penalty or tax under ERISA or the Code.

(c) No Company Plan is a "multiemployer plan," as such term is defined in
Section 3(37) of ERISA, nor is any Company Plan subject to Section 302 or
Title IV of ERISA or Section 412 of the Code. Except as disclosed in Section
3.13(c) of the Company Disclosure Letter, as of November 30, 2009, there were

22  Section 302 of ERISA or Section 412 of the Code, for which any of Parent,
the Company, the Surviving Company or any of its or their Subsidiaries or its
or their ERISA Affiliates, could reasonably be expected to incur liability
under Title IV of ERISA, Section 302 of ERISA or Section 412 of the Code. No
liability under Title IV, Section 302 of ERISA or Section 412 of the Code has

their Subsidiaries or any of its or their ERISA Affiliates of incurring any
such liability, other than liability for premiums due the Pension Benefit
Guaranty Corporation arising in the ordinary course (which premiums have been

expected, individually or in the aggregate, to be material to the Company.

ERISA Affiliates have, within the six (6) years immediately preceding the date
of this Agreement, withdrawn or partially withdrawn from any "multiemployer
plan," as such term is defined in Section 3(37) of ERISA. Neither the
Company, any of its Subsidiaries nor any of its or their ERISA Affiliates
have, within the past twelve (12) months, received notice from any
"multiemployer plan" that it is in reorganization or is insolvent, that
increased contributions may be required to avoid a reduction in plan benefits
or the imposition of any excise Tax, or that such plan intends to terminate or
has terminated.

(e) Each Company Plan has been drafted, operated and administered in all
material respects in accordance with its terms and the requirements of all
applicable Laws, including but not limited to ERISA and the Code, except for
instances of noncompliance that, individually or in the aggregate, are
immaterial.

(f) Except as disclosed in Section 3.13(f) of the Company Disclosure Letter or
the Company SEC Documents, no Company Plan provides medical, surgical,
hospitalization, death or similar benefits (whether or not insured) for
directors, consultants, independent contractors, employees or former
directors, consultants, independent contractors, or employees of the Company
or any of its Subsidiaries for periods extending beyond their retirement or
other termination of service, other than (i) coverage mandated by applicable
Law, (ii) death benefits under any "pension plan" (within the meaning of
Section 3(2) of ERISA) or (iii) benefits the full cost of which is borne by
the current or former director, consultant, independent contractor or employee
(or his beneficiary). No Company Plan is funded, in whole or in part, through
a voluntary employees beneficiary association exempt from taxation
under Section 501(c)(9) of the Code.

(g) Except as disclosed in Section 3.13(g) of the Company Disclosure Letter,
neither the Offer, the execution or delivery of this Agreement nor the
consummation of the Transactions will, either alone or in conjunction with any
other event, (i) entitle any current or former director, employee, consultant
or independent contractor of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to
severance pay, unemployment compensation or any other payment, except as
expressly provided in this Agreement, (ii) increase the amount or value of any
benefit or compensation otherwise payable or required to be provided to any
such director, employee, consultant or independent contractor, or (iii)
accelerate the time of payment or vesting of compensation due any such
director, employee, consultant or independent contractor. Except as 



 

23  disclosed in Section 3.13(g) of the Company Disclosure Letter, no payment or
benefit paid or provided, or to be paid or provided, whether contingent or
otherwise, to current or former employees, directors or other service
providers of or to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries (including pursuant
to this Agreement) will fail to be deductible for federal income Tax purposes
under Section 280G of the Code. Except as disclosed in Section 3.13(g) of the
Company Disclosure Letter, no Company Plan or other agreement with any
employee provides for a "gross-up" or similar payment in respect of any Taxes
that may become payable under Section 409A or Section 4999 of the Code.

(h) There are no pending, or to the Knowledge of the Company, threatened or
anticipated claims, actions, lawsuits, proceedings, investigations or audits
against any Company Plan, the assets of any of the trusts under such plans or
the plan sponsor or the plan administrator, or against any fiduciary of any
Company Plans, or otherwise involving any Company Plan (other than routine
claims for benefits).

(i) All contributions, premiums and benefit payments under or in connection
with the Company Plans required to have been made under the terms of any
Company Plan or pursuant to ERISA, the Code and applicable Law have been
timely made in all material respects and all obligations in respect of
each Company Plan, including, with respect to any period on or before the
Effective Time, have been properly accrued and reflected in the Company SEC
Documents.

(j) Each Company Plan subject to any Law other than U.S. federal, state or
local Law (" _Foreign Plan_ ") that is intended to comply with the
requirements of any Tax or pension Laws in order for contributions thereto or
benefits thereunder to receive intended Tax benefits or favorable Tax
treatment complies in all material respects with such Laws. Each Foreign Plan
required to be registered has been registered (and where applicable, accepted
for registration) and has been maintained in good standing with applicable
Governmental Authorities and regulatory authorities and no material fact or
event has occurred that could reasonably be expected to adversely affect such
good standing status or result in the imposition of any material liability,
penalty or Tax under applicable Law. Except as disclosed in Section 3.13(j) of
the Company Disclosure Letter, other than such amounts that would not be
material, the fair market value of the assets of each funded Foreign Plan,
together with any accrued contributions, is sufficient in all material
respects to provide for the accrued benefit obligations with respect to all
current and former participants in such plan, in compliance with applicable
Law.

in connection with their employment with the Company or any Subsidiary. To

Section 5.2 _Shareholders Meeting; Merger Without Meeting of Company
Shareholders_.

(a) If the approval of this Agreement by the Company Shareholders is required
by the TBCA, as soon as practicable following the Acceptance Time, the
Company shall prepare and file with the SEC, subject to the prior review,
comment and approval of Parent (which approval shall not be unreasonably
withheld or delayed), a proxy statement relating to the Company Shareholder
Approval (such proxy statement, as amended or supplemented from time 



 

40  to time, the " _Proxy Statement_ "). The Company will use its reasonable
best efforts to cause the Proxy Statement to be mailed to the Company
Shareholders as promptly as practicable after clearing comments received from
the SEC or its staff. No filing of, or amendment or supplement to, the Proxy
Statement will be made by the Company without Parents prior consent (which
consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed) and without providing
Parent and its counsel the reasonable opportunity to review and comment
thereon. The Company shall advise Parent promptly of any request by the SEC or
its staff for amendment of the Proxy Statement or comments thereon and
responses thereto or requests by the SEC or its staff for additional
information. If at any time prior to the Effective Time any information
relating to Parent or the Company, or any of their respective Affiliates,
officers or directors, should become known to Parent or the Company which
should be set forth in an amendment or supplement to the Proxy Statement, so
that any of such documents would not include any misstatement of a material
fact or omit to state any material fact necessary to make the statements
therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not
misleading, the party which discovers such information shall promptly notify
the other parties hereto and an appropriate amendment or supplement
describing such information shall be promptly filed with the SEC and, to the
extent required by Law, disseminated to the Company Shareholders.

(b) Each of the Company and Parent shall supply such information specifically
for inclusion or incorporation by reference in the Proxy Statement necessary
so that, at the date it is first mailed to the Company Shareholders or at the
time of the Company Shareholders Meeting, the Proxy Statement shall not
contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material
fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make
the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they are
made, not misleading. Each of the parties hereto shall use their reasonable
best efforts so that the Proxy Statement will comply as to form in all
material respects with the requirements of the Exchange Act and the rules and
regulations thereunder.

(c) If required by applicable Law in order to consummate the Merger, the
Company, acting through the Companys Board of Directors, shall, in accordance
with applicable Law and the Company Charter Documents: (i) promptly and duly
call, give notice of, convene and hold as soon as reasonably practicable, a
meeting of the Company Shareholders for the purpose of approving the Merger
and this Agreement (the " _Company Shareholders Meeting_ ") as soon as
practicable following the Acceptance Time (or, if later, following the
termination of the subsequent offering period, if any), (ii) include in the
Proxy Statement the recommendation of the Board of Directors of the Company
that the Company Shareholders vote in favor of the approval of the Merger and
this Agreement, and (iii) obtain the Company Shareholder Approval.

(d) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, the
Company shall not be required to hold the Company Shareholders Meeting if this
Agreement is terminated in accordance with Section 7.1.

(e) Notwithstanding Section 5.2(c) or 5.2(d), in the event that Parent or
Merger Sub shall acquire (including pursuant to the Top-Up Option and
pursuant to any subsequent offering period), together with the shares of
Company Common Stock owned by Parent, Merger Sub and any other Subsidiary of
Parent, at least ninety percent (90%) of the shares of Company Common Stock
then outstanding (calculated in accordance with the TBCA), 



 

41  the parties agree to take all necessary and appropriate action to cause the
Merger to become effective as soon as practicable after the Acceptance Time
without a Company Shareholders Meeting in accordance with the applicable
provisions of the TBCA.

(f) Parent shall continue to hold all shares acquired in the Offer through
the Effective Time and shall vote, or cause to be voted, all of the Company
Common Stock acquired in the Offer or otherwise then owned by it, Merger Sub
or any of Parents other Subsidiaries in favor of the approval of the Merger
and this Agreement.

Section 5.3 _No Solicitation_.

(a) Subject to Section 5.3(c), until the earlier of the Board Appointment Date
or the date on which this Agreement is terminated pursuant to Section 7.1,
the Company shall not, nor shall it authorize or permit any of its
Subsidiaries, any of its or their respective directors, officers or employees
or any financial advisor, attorney, accountant or other advisor, agent
or representative (collectively, " _Representatives_ ") retained by the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries to, directly or indirectly through another
Person, except as otherwise provided below, (i) solicit, initiate, or
knowingly encourage (including by way of furnishing information or
assistance), or knowingly induce or take any other action designed to or which
would reasonably be expected to lead to, any inquiries or the making of, any
proposal that constitutes, or is reasonably likely to lead to, a Takeover
Proposal or (ii) other than informing Persons of the provisions contained in
this Section 5.3, enter into, continue or participate in any discussions or
negotiations regarding any Takeover Proposal, or furnish any information
concerning the Company and its Subsidiaries to any Person in connection with
any Takeover Proposal, or otherwise cooperate with or take any other action to
knowingly facilitate or induce any effort or attempt to make or implement a
Takeover Proposal. The Company shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries and
their respective Representatives to, immediately cease and cause to be
terminated all existing discussions or negotiations with any Person previously
conducted with respect to any Takeover Proposal. Notwithstanding anything in
this Section 5.3 to the contrary, at any time prior to the Acceptance Time, in
response to an unsolicited _bona fide_ written Takeover Proposal, received
under circumstances not involving a breach of this Agreement, that the
Companys Board of Directors determines in good faith (after consultation with
a financial advisor of nationally recognized reputation) constitutes or is
reasonably likely to result in a Superior Proposal, the Company may, after
providing the notice and information required by Section 5.3(e), upon a good
faith determination by the Companys Board of Directors (after receiving the
advice of its outside counsel) that failure to take such action would be
reasonably likely to constitute or result in a violation by the Companys
Board of Directors of its fiduciary duties to the Company Shareholders under
applicable Law, and after giving Parent prompt written notice of such
determination, (A) furnish information with respect to the Company and its
Subsidiaries to the Person making such Takeover Proposal (and its
Representatives); _provided_ , that the Company and such Person enter into
a confidentiality agreement containing confidentiality, standstill and other
provisions substantially similar to the Confidentiality Agreement and not less
restrictive to such Person than the provisions of the Confidentiality
Agreement are to Parent and containing provisions that expressly permit the
Company to comply with the provisions of this Section 5.3 (a copy of which
shall be provided to Parent promptly after its execution), except that
notwithstanding the foregoing, the terms of such confidentiality agreement
shall not prevent such Person from making a Takeover Proposal to the Company
or 



 

42  the Companys Board of Directors; and _provided_ , _further_ , that all such
information has previously been provided to Parent or is provided to Parent at
substantially the same time it is provided to such Person and (B) participate
in discussions or negotiations with the Person making such Takeover Proposal
(and its Representatives) regarding such Takeover Proposal.

(b) The Board of Directors of the Company shall not (i) withdraw, modify or
qualify, in a manner adverse to Parent, the Company Recommendation or (ii)
adopt, recommend or propose publicly to adopt or recommend to the Company
Shareholders a Takeover Proposal (any action described in clause (i) or (ii)
being referred to as a " _Company Adverse Recommendation Change_ ") (it being
understood and agreed that any "stop, look and listen" communication by the
Board of Directors to the Company Shareholders pursuant to Rule 14d-9(f) under
the Exchange Act shall not constitute a Company Adverse Recommendation
Change), unless (A) the Companys Board of Directors shall make a good faith
determination (after receiving the advice of its outside counsel) that failure
to take such action would be reasonably likely to constitute or result in a
violation by the Companys Board of Directors of its fiduciary duties to the
Company Shareholders under applicable Law and the Company complies with
Section 5.3(d) (after taking into account any amendments of this Agreement as
contemplated by Section 5.3(d)) and (B) in the event that the Company Adverse
Recommendation Change is not being made in response to or as a result of a
Superior Proposal, there has been a material development or change
in circumstances relating to the Companys business, assets and operations
that occurs or arises after the date of this Agreement that was not known by
the Companys Board of Directors as of the date of this Agreement (an "
_Intervening Event_ ").

(c) The Board of Directors of the Company shall not authorize the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries to enter into any merger, acquisition or similar
agreement with respect to any Takeover Proposal (other than a confidentiality
agreement referred to in Section 5.3(a)) (each, a " _Company Acquisition
Agreement_ ") and the Company shall not (and shall not permit any Subsidiary
to) enter into any Company Acquisition Agreement, unless the Board of
Directors of the Company determines in good faith (after consultation with a
financial advisor of nationally recognized reputation) that such Takeover
Proposal constitutes a Superior Proposal and the Company complies with Section
5.3(d).

(d) The Company shall not be entitled to (A) make a Company Adverse
Recommendation Change or (B) enter into any Company Acquisition Agreement
unless: (i) the Company has provided to Parent four (4) Business Days prior
written notice (an " _Adverse Recommendation Change Notice_ "), which Adverse
Recommendation Change Notice shall specify that the Board of Directors of the
Company is prepared to make a Company Adverse Recommendation Change and/or
enter into any Company Acquisition Agreement, as applicable, and, (1) in the
case of a Takeover Proposal that the Companys Board of Directors has
determined constitutes a Superior Proposal, shall contain a description of the
material terms of such Takeover Proposal and a statement that the Board of
Directors of the Company has determined that such Takeover Proposal is a
Superior Proposal and a statement that the Board of Directors of the Company
intends to enter into an agreement providing for such Superior Proposal,
identifying the parties thereto, and delivering to Parent a copy of the
Company Acquisition Agreement and other relevant documents for such Superior
Proposal in the form to be entered into and (2) in the case of an Intervening
Event, a reasonably detailed description of 



 

43  the Intervening Event, (ii) during the four (4) Business Day period
following the date of receipt of the Adverse Recommendation Change Notice, if
requested by Parent, the Company has engaged in good-faith negotiations with
Parent to amend this Agreement in such a manner that (A) the Intervening Event
no longer requires a Company Adverse Recommendation Change or (B) the Takeover
Proposal that was determined to constitute a Superior Proposal no longer is a
Superior Proposal, (iii) at midnight, Chattanooga time, at the end of the four
(4) Business Day period following the date of receipt of the Adverse
Recommendation Change Notice (or, in the event that a Takeover Proposal has
been materially revised or modified, at the end of midnight, Chattanooga time,
on the fourth (4th) Business Day following the date of receipt of notice of
such material revision or modification, if later), (1) in the case of a
Takeover Proposal, such Takeover Proposal has not been withdrawn and continues
to constitute a Superior Proposal (taking into account all changes to the
terms of this Agreement proposed by Parent) and (2) in the case of an
Intervening Event, such Intervening Event continues to require a Company
Adverse Recommendation Change (taking into account all changes to the terms of
this Agreement proposed by Parent), and (iv) in the case of the foregoing
clause (B), the Company shall terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section
7.1(d)(ii) and pay to Parent the Termination Fee payable pursuant to Section
7.3(a).

(e) In addition to the obligations of the Company set forth in Section 5.3(a)
and Section 5.3(d), the Company shall promptly advise Parent, orally and in
writing, and in no event later than twenty four (24) hours after receipt, if
any proposal, offer or inquiry is received by, any information is requested
from, or any discussions or negotiations are sought to be initiated or
continued with, the Company in respect of any Takeover Proposal, and shall,
in any such notice to Parent, indicate the identity of the Person making such
proposal, offer, inquiry or other contact and the material terms and
conditions of any proposals or offers or the nature of any inquiries or
contacts (and shall include with such notice copies of any written materials
received from or on behalf of such Person relating to such proposal, offer,
inquiry or request), and thereafter shall promptly keep Parent fully informed
of all material developments affecting the status and the material terms of
any such proposals, offers, inquiries or requests (and the Company shall
provide Parent with copies of any additional written materials received that
relate to such proposals, offers, inquiries or requests) and of the status of
any such discussions or negotiations.

(f) For purposes of this Agreement: 

" _Takeover Proposal_ " means a _bona fide_ inquiry, proposal or offer from
any Person (other than Parent and its Subsidiaries) relating to any (i)
direct or indirect acquisition or purchase of assets of the Company and its
Subsidiaries (including securities of the Companys Subsidiaries, but
excluding sales of assets in the ordinary course of business) equal to 20% or
more of the Companys consolidated assets or to which 20% or more of the
Companys revenues, earnings or assets on a consolidated basis are
attributable, (ii) acquisition of 20% or more of the outstanding Company
Common Stock, (iii) tender offer or exchange offer that if consummated would
result in any Person beneficially owning 20% or more of the outstanding
Company Common Stock or (iv) merger, consolidation, share exchange,
business combination, recapitalization, liquidation, dissolution or similar
transaction involving the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, in each case,
other than the Transactions.

  

 

44 " _Superior Proposal_ " means a _bona fide_ written Takeover Proposal (
_provided_ , that for purposes of this definition references to 20% in the
definition of "Takeover Proposal" shall be deemed to be references to 50%)
which includes consideration per share of Company Common Stock that is greater
than the Offer Price (including, in the case of non-cash consideration, a
determination by the Board of Directors, after consultation with a financial
advisor of nationally recognized reputation, that the value of such non-cash
consideration per share of Company Common Stock is greater than the Offer
Price) and which the Board of Directors of the Company determines in its good
faith (after consultation with a financial advisor of nationally recognized
reputation) to be more favorable to the Company Shareholders from a financial
point of view than the Transactions, taking into account at the time of
determination all relevant circumstances, including all the terms and
conditions of such proposal and this Agreement, and the ability of the
Person making such Takeover Proposal to consummate the transactions
contemplated by such Takeover Proposal (based upon, among other things, the
availability of financing and the expectation of obtaining required
approvals).

(g) Nothing in this Section 5.3 shall prohibit the Board of Directors of the
Company from taking and disclosing to the Company Shareholders a position
contemplated by Rule 14e-2(a), Rule 14d-9 or Item 1012(a) of Regulation M-A
promulgated under the Exchange Act, or other applicable Law, if the Board of
Directors of the Company determines, after consultation with outside counsel,
that failure to so disclose such position could constitute a violation of
applicable Law; _provided_ , _however_ , that a "stop, look and listen"
communication by the Board of Directors to the Company Shareholders pursuant
to Rule 14d-9(f) under the Exchange Act, a factually accurate public statement
by the Company that describes the Companys receipt of a Takeover Proposal and
the operation of this Agreement with respect thereto, an express rejection
of any applicable Takeover Proposal, or an express reaffirmation of its
recommendation that Company Shareholders approve this Agreement and the
Transactions, shall not be deemed to be a Company Adverse Recommendation
Change (including for purposes of Section 7.1(c)(ii)).

Section 5.4 _Reasonable Best Efforts_.

(a) Each party shall make or cause to be made, in cooperation with the other
parties and to the extent applicable and as promptly as practicable, (i) an
appropriate filing of a Notification and Report Form pursuant to the HSR Act
with respect to the Transactions and (ii) all other necessary filings, forms,
declarations, notifications, registrations and notices with other
Governmental Entities under Antitrust Laws relating to the transactions
contemplated hereby. Each party shall use its reasonable best efforts to
respond at the earliest practicable date to any requests for additional
information made by the United States Department of Justice or any other
Governmental Authorities, and act in good faith and reasonably cooperate with
the other party in connection with any investigation of any Governmental
Authority. Each party shall use its reasonable best efforts to furnish to
each other all information required for any filing, form, declaration,
notification, registration and notice subject to advice of such partys
antitrust counsel. Each party shall give the other party reasonable
prior notice of any communication with, and any proposed understanding or
agreement with, any Governmental Authority regarding any filings, forms,
declarations, notifications, registrations or notices, and permit the other to
review and discuss in advance, and consider in good faith the views of the
other in connection with, any proposed communication, understanding or
agreement with any Governmental Authority with 



 

45  respect to the Transactions subject to advice of such partys antitrust
counsel. None of the parties shall independently participate in any meeting,
or engage in any substantive conversation, with any Governmental Authority in
respect of any filings or inquiry without giving the other party prior notice
of the meeting and, unless prohibited by such Governmental Authority, the
opportunity to attend and/or participate. The parties will consult and
cooperate with one another in connection with any information or proposals
submitted in connection with proceedings under or relating to any Antitrust
Law. Without limiting the foregoing, the Company and Parent shall each use
its reasonable best efforts: (i) to avoid the entry of any Restraint; (ii) to
eliminate every impediment under any Antitrust Law that may be asserted by any
Governmental Authority so as to enable the Closing to occur as soon
as reasonably possible (and in any event no later than the Outside Date),
except that the Company and Parent shall not be required to agree to any
divestitures proposed by any Governmental Authority unless such divestitures
are, in the aggregate, both immaterial to the Company and its business as
currently conducted and to Parent and its business as currently conducted; and
(iii) to vigorously contest and resist any such action or proceeding,
including any administrative or judicial action. 

(b) Each of the parties to this Agreement agrees to use its reasonable best
efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions, and to do, or cause to be
done, all things necessary, proper or advisable to consummate and make
effective, in the most expeditious manner practicable, the Transactions,
including (i) the obtaining of all other necessary actions, consents,
approvals, waivers, licenses, permits, authorizations, orders and approvals
from Governmental Authorities and the making of all other necessary
registrations and filings (including filings with Governmental Authorities, if
any), (ii) the obtaining of all consents, approvals or waivers from third
parties that are necessary to consummate the Transactions, (iii) the
preparation of the Offer Documents, the Schedule 14D-9 and any other documents
that may be required to be filed with the SEC and (iv) the execution and
delivery of any additional instruments reasonably necessary to consummate the
Transactions and to fully carry out the purposes of this Agreement.

Section 5.5 _Public Announcements_. The initial press release with respect to
the execution of this Agreement shall be a joint press release to be
reasonably agreed upon by Parent and the Company. Except as permitted by
Section 5.3(b), Parent and the Company shall consult with each other before
issuing, and, to the extent practicable, give each other the
reasonable opportunity to review and comment upon, any press release or other
public statements with respect to the Transactions and shall not issue any
such press release or make any such public statement prior to such
consultation, except as may be required by applicable Law, court process or
by obligations pursuant to any listing agreement with or rules of any
securities exchange or trading market on which securities of Parent or the
Company are listed.

Section 5.6 _Access to Information; Confidentiality_. From the date of this
Agreement until the Effective Time, the Company shall afford to Parent,
Merger Sub and their respective Representatives reasonable access during
normal business hours to the Companys properties, books, records and
personnel and the Company shall furnish promptly to Parent and Merger Sub
such other information concerning its business, properties and personnel as
Parent or Merger Sub may from time to time reasonably request; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that the Company shall not be required to provide access to any
information or documents which would, in the reasonable judgment of the
Company, (a) breach any Contract of the Company or any of its



 

46  Subsidiaries with any third-party, (b) constitute a waiver of the attorney-
client or other privilege held by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, (c)
violate any applicable Laws or (d) result in a competitor of the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries receiving material information which is competitively
sensitive. Until the Effective Time, the information provided pursuant to this
Section 5.6 will be subject to the terms of the Confidentiality Agreement.

Section 5.7 _Indemnification and Insurance_.

(a) Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to assume the obligations
with respect to all rights to indemnification and exculpation from
liabilities, including advancement of expenses, for acts or omissions
occurring at or prior to the Effective Time now existing in favor of the
current or former directors or officers of the Company and its Subsidiaries
(each, an " _Indemnitee_ " and, collectively, the " _Indemnitees_ ") as
provided in the Company Charter Documents as in effect on the date hereof,
without further action, as of the Effective Time and such obligations shall
survive the Merger and shall continue in full force and effect in accordance
with their terms for a period of six (6) years from and after the Effective
Time; _provided_ , that in the event any claim or claims are asserted or made
within such six (6) year period, all rights to indemnification in respect of
any such claim or claims shall continue until final disposition of any and all
such claims. Without limiting the foregoing, Parent, for a period of six (6)
years from and after the Effective Time, shall cause the charter and by-laws
of the Surviving Corporation (or any successor) to contain provisions no less
favorable to the Indemnitees with respect to limitation of liabilities of
directors and officers and indemnification than are set forth as of the date
of this Agreement in the Company Charter Documents, which provisions shall not
be amended, repealed or otherwise modified in a manner that would adversely
affect the rights thereunder of the Indemnitees, unless such modification
shall be required by applicable Law.

(b) From and after the Effective Time, Parent shall, and shall cause the
Surviving Corporation to, pay the expenses (including the reasonable fees and
expenses of legal counsel) of any Indemnitee (including in connection with
enforcing the indemnity and other obligations provided for in this Section
5.7) promptly after statements and reasonable documentation therefor are
received, and otherwise advance to such Indemnitee upon request for
reimbursement of such expenses incurred, in each case to the fullest extent
permitted under applicable Law; _provided_ that the Person to whom expenses
are advanced provides (i) written affirmation of the Indemnitees good faith
determination that any applicable standard of conduct required by the TBCA has
been met and (ii) an undertaking to repay such advances to the extent
required by applicable Law. Any determination required to be made with respect
to whether an Indemnitees conduct complies with the standards set forth under
applicable Law, the Company Charter Documents or a written Contract between
an Indemnitee and the Company or one of its Subsidiaries, as the case may be,
shall be made by independent special legal counsel selected by the Board of
Directors of the Surviving Corporation or a committee thereof in the manner
prescribed by Section 48-18-506 of the TBCA, the fees of which counsel shall
be paid by the Surviving Corporation.

(c) An Indemnitee shall notify the Surviving Corporation in writing promptly
upon learning of any claim, action, suit, proceeding, investigation or other
matter in respect of which such indemnification may be sought. The Surviving
Corporation shall have the 



 

47  right, but not the obligation, to assume and control the defense of any act
or omission covered under this Section 5.7 (each, a " _Claim_ ") with counsel
selected by the Surviving Corporation, which counsel shall be reasonably
acceptable to the applicable Indemnitee; _provided_ , _however_ , that such
Indemnitee shall be permitted to participate in the defense of such Claim at
his or her own expense. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary, in no event
shall the Surviving Corporation be liable for any settlement or compromise
effected without its written consent, which shall not be unreasonably withheld
or delayed. Each of Parent, the Company and the Surviving Corporation shall
cooperate in the defense of any Claim and shall provide access to properties
and individuals as reasonably requested by the Indemnitees; furnish or cause
to be furnished records, information and testimony; and attend such
conferences, discovery proceedings, hearings, trials or appeals as may be
reasonably requested by the Indemnitees in connection therewith.

(d) For the six (6)-year period commencing immediately after the Effective
Time, Parent shall maintain in effect directors and officers liability
insurance covering acts or omissions occurring prior to the Effective Time
with respect to those Persons who are currently (and any additional Persons
who at or prior to the Effective Time become) covered by the Companys
directors and officers liability insurance policies (correct and complete
copies of which have been delivered to Parent) on terms with respect to such
coverage, and in an amount, no less favorable in any material respect to such
individuals than the policies in effect on the date of this Agreement (or
Parent may substitute therefor policies, issued by reputable insurers, of at
least the same coverage with respect to matters occurring prior to the
Effective Time; _provided_ that any substitution or replacement of existing
policies shall not result in any gaps or lapses of coverage with respect to
facts, events, acts or omissions occurring at or prior to the Effective Time);
_provided_ , _however_ , that, if the aggregate annual premiums for such
insurance shall exceed 300% of the current aggregate annual premiums, then
Parent shall provide or cause to be provided a policy for the applicable
individuals with as much comparable coverage as available at an annual premium
of 300% of the current aggregate annual premiums. Parent shall endeavor to
purchase (or cause to be purchased by an Affiliate) a six (6)year prepaid
"tail policy" on terms and conditions providing substantially equivalent
benefits as the current policies of directors and officers liability
insurance maintained by the Company and its Subsidiaries with respect to
matters arising on or before the Board Appointment Date, covering without
limitation the Transactions (the " _Tail Prepaid Policy_ "). If Parent has
not purchased (or caused to be purchased by an Affiliate) the Tail Prepaid
Policy at least two (2) Business Days prior to the date on which the
Acceptance Time occurs, the Company may purchase the Tail Prepaid Policy prior
to date on which the Acceptance Time occurs, so long as the cost thereof is
not in excess of 600% of the current aggregate annual premiums. If the Tail
Prepaid Policy has been obtained prior to the Board Appointment Date, the
provisions of this Section 5.7(d) shall be deemed to have been satisfied and
Parent shall cause such Tail Prepaid Policy to be maintained in full force and
effect, for its full term, and cause all obligations thereunder to be honored
by the Surviving Corporation. The Indemnitees may be required to make
reasonable application and provide reasonable and customary representations
and warranties to applicable insurance carriers for the purpose of obtaining
such insurance.

(e) In the event that Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any of their
respective successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any
other Person and is not the continuing or surviving corporation or entity of
such consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers 



 

48  or conveys all or substantially all of its properties and assets to any
Person, then, and in each such case, proper provision shall be made so that
the successors and assigns of Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall
assume all of the obligations thereof set forth in this Section 5.7.

(f) The provisions of this Section 5.7 are (i) intended to be for the benefit
of, and shall be enforceable by, each Indemnitee, his or her heirs and his or
her representatives and (ii) in addition to, and not in substitution for, and
shall not impair, any other rights to indemnification or contribution that
any such Person may have under the Company Charter Documents, or the
comparable organization documents of the Surviving Corporation or any of its
Subsidiaries, under applicable Law, or otherwise. The obligations of Parent
and the Surviving Corporation under this Section 5.7 shall not be terminated
or modified in such a manner as to adversely affect the rights of any
Indemnitee unless (A) such termination or modification is required by
applicable Law or (B) the affected Indemnitee shall have consented in writing
to such termination or modification. Parent shall ensure that the Surviving
Corporation complies with all of its obligations under this Section 5.7. 

Section 5.8 _Fees and Expenses._ Except as provided in Section 7.3, all fees
and expenses incurred in connection with this Agreement and the Transactions
shall be paid by the party incurring such fees or expenses, whether or not the
Transactions are consummated.

Section 5.9 _Employee Matters_.

(a) All employees of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries as of
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be employed by the Surviving
Corporation or its Subsidiaries as of the Effective Time (the " _Continuing
Employees_ "). For the period commencing at the Effective Time through and
including December 31, 2011, Parent shall, or shall cause the Surviving
Corporation to, provide the Continuing Employees who remain employees of the
Surviving Corporation with compensation and employee benefits excluding the
items contemplated by Sections 5.9(e) and 5.9(f), that, in the aggregate, are
no less favorable than the compensation (including base salary and annual
cash-based incentive compensation opportunities other than equity-based
incentive compensation) and employee benefits provided to such individuals by
the Company and its Subsidiaries immediately prior to the Effective Time.
Parent agrees that the Surviving Corporation shall cause the Surviving
Corporations employee benefit plans established following the Closing Date
(if any) and any other employee benefit plans covering the Continuing
Employees following the Effective Time (collectively, the " _Post-Closing
Plans_ "), to recognize the service of each Continuing Employee (to the
extent such service was recognized by the Company) for purposes of
eligibility, vesting and determination of the level of benefits (but not for
benefit accrual purposes) under the Post-Closing Plans. For the calendar
year including the Effective Time, the Continuing Employees shall not be
required to satisfy any deductible, co-payment, out-of-pocket maximum or
similar requirements under the Post-Closing Plans that provide medical, dental
and other welfare benefits (collectively, the " _Post-Closing Welfare Plans_
") to the extent of amounts previously credited for such purposes under
comparable Company Plans that provide medical, dental and other welfare
benefits (the " _Company Welfare Plans_ "). For the calendar year including
the Effective Time, any waiting periods, pre-existing condition exclusions and
requirements to show evidence of good health contained in such Post-Closing
Welfare Plans shall be waived with respect to the Continuing Employees
(except to the extent any such waiting period, pre-existing condition
exclusion, or 



 

49  requirement of show evidence of good health was already in effect with
respect to such employees and that have not been satisfied under the
applicable Company Welfare Plan in which the participant then participates or
is otherwise eligible to participate as of immediately prior to the Effective
Time).

(b) Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, as of the Effective
Time, Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries to
honor in accordance with their terms, all employment, change in control,
severance and other compensation plans, agreements and arrangements existing
immediately prior to the execution of this Agreement, or as contemplated by
Section 5.9(e) of the Company Disclosure Letter, which are between the Company
or any of its Subsidiaries and any director, officer or employee thereof or
maintained by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries (each, a " _Company
Agreement_ "). Parent and the Company hereby agree that the occurrence of the
Acceptance Time shall constitute a " _Change in Control_ " for purposes of
all Company Agreements and all Company Plans in which the term is relevant.

(c) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, no provision
of this Agreement shall be deemed to (i) guarantee employment for any period
of time for, or preclude the ability of the Surviving Corporation to
terminate, any Continuing Employee following the Effective Time, (ii) be
construed as an amendment of any employee benefit plan or policy of Parent or
the Surviving Corporation or their affiliates, and (iii) no provision of this
Section 5.9(c) shall create any third-party beneficiary rights in any
employee or former employee (including any beneficiary or dependent of such
employee or former employee) of the Company in respect of their employment or
any other matter.

(d) Parent acknowledges that the Company shall be entitled to pay the annual
cash bonuses earned by employees of the Company and its Subsidiaries in
respect of the Companys fiscal year ended November 30, 2009, in 2009 (with
the amounts of such bonuses being determined in a manner consistent with past
practices), subject to compliance with Section 409A of the Code and the
regulations and guidance promulgated thereunder, to the extent applicable. The
Surviving Corporation shall also be entitled to pay annual cash bonuses under
a substantially equivalent annual incentive plan with respect to bonus levels
and participation established, in accordance with past practice, for the
Companys fiscal year commencing on December 1, 2009, calculated at target on
a pro-rata basis as of the Closing Date, as well as previously agreed to bonus
amounts as disclosed in Section 5.9(d) of the Company Disclosure Letter, in
each case, subject to compliance with Section 409A of the Code and the
regulations and guidance promulgated thereunder, to the extent applicable.

(e) Parent shall enter into the arrangements disclosed in Section 5.9(e) of
the Company Disclosure Letter on the date hereof. 

(f) As soon as reasonably practicable following the Effective Time, but in no
event later than sixty (60) days following the Effective Time, Parent shall,
or shall cause the Company, either alone or together with Parent, to, provide
incentive compensation eligibility for management of the Surviving Corporation
in order to provide participants with incentive compensation that, when taken
into account with the amount of total compensation (excluding the items
contemplated by Section 5.9(e)) received by such participants following the
Effective Time, is intended to provide economic value that is substantially
comparable on an overall basis to that provided by the equity-based incentive
compensation plans of the Company.



 

50 (g) Parent agrees that following the Effective Time, Chattanooga, Tennessee
shall remain the headquarters of the Surviving Corporation and shall be the
operational headquarters of Parents United States "over-the-counter"
business.

Section 5.10 _Section 16 Matters_. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company
shall take all such steps as may be required and permitted to cause the
Transactions, including any dispositions of Company Common Stock (including
derivative securities with respect to such Company Common Stock) by each

contained in Sections 3.8(b) and 3.26 shall be true and correct in all
respects, (iii) each representation or warranty of the Company contained in
Sections 3.1(a), 3.2, 3.5(b), 3.6(c), 3.6(d), 3.6(e), 3.23, 3.24 and 3.25,

or warranty of the Company contained in any other section of the Agreement,

its terms.

The foregoing conditions are for the sole benefit of Parent and Merger Sub,
may be asserted by either Parent or Merger Sub, regardless of the
circumstances giving rise to any such conditions ( _provided_ , that nothing
herein shall relieve any party hereto from any obligation or liability such
party has under the Agreement), and, except for the Minimum Condition, may be
waived by Parent or Merger Sub in whole or in part at any time and from time
to time, subject to the terms of the Agreement and applicable Law. The failure
by Parent or Merger Sub at any time to exercise any of the foregoing rights
shall not be deemed a waiver of any such right, the waiver of such right with
respect to any particular facts or circumstances shall not be deemed a waiver
with respect to any other facts and circumstances, and each such right shall
be deemed an ongoing right which may be asserted at any time and from time to
time.

The capitalized terms used in this Annex A shall have the meanings set forth
in the Agreement to which it is annexed, except that the term "Agreement"
