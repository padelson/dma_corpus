This AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER, dated as of February 5, 2012 (this "
_Agreement_ "), by and among FIDELITY NATIONAL FINANCIAL, INC., a Delaware
corporation (" _Parent_ "), FRED MERGER SUB INC., a Tennessee corporation and
an indirect, wholly-owned Subsidiary of Parent (" _Merger Sub_ "), and
OCHARLEYS INC., a Tennessee corporation (the " _Company_ "). Certain
capitalized terms are defined in _Section 9.12_.

RECITALS 

WHEREAS, on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this
Agreement, Merger Sub shall commence a cash tender offer (such tender offer,
as it may be extended, amended and supplemented from time to time as permitted
by this Agreement, the " _Offer_ ") to purchase all of the issued and
outstanding shares of common stock, no par value per share, of the Company
(the " _Company Common Stock_ ") at a price per share equal to $9.85, subject
to applicable Tax withholding, net to the seller in cash (such amount or any
greater amount per share paid pursuant to the Offer, the " _Offer Price_ ");

WHEREAS, subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, following the
consummation of the Offer, Merger Sub shall merge with and into the Company,
with the Company surviving the Merger as an indirect, wholly-owned Subsidiary
of Parent (the " _Merger_ "), pursuant to which each outstanding share of
Company Common Stock shall be converted into the right to receive the Offer
Price, except for shares of Company Common Stock to be canceled pursuant to
_Section 2.8(a)_;

WHEREAS, the Board of Directors of the Company has unanimously (i) declared
that this Agreement and the Transactions are advisable, fair to and in the
best interest of the Company and the Company Shareholders, (ii) adopted this
Agreement and approved the execution, delivery and performance of this
Agreement, and the consummation of the Offer, the Merger and the other
Transactions, (iii) directed that the adoption of this Agreement be submitted
to the holders of Company Common Stock, to the extent required by applicable
Law, (iv) subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, recommended
that the Company Shareholders accept the Offer and tender their shares
of Company Common Stock pursuant to the Offer and, to the extent required by
applicable Law, approve the Merger and adopt this Agreement and (v) subject to
the terms and conditions of this Agreement, authorized and approved the Top-Up
Option and the issuance of the Top-Up Option Shares thereunder;

WHEREAS, the Board of Directors of Parent and the Board of Directors
of Merger Sub have (i) declared it advisable to enter into this Agreement and
(ii) adopted this Agreement and approved the execution, delivery and
performance of this Agreement by Parent and Merger Sub, respectively, and the
consummation of the Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby;

WHEREAS, Parent, Merger Sub and the Company desire to make
certain representations, warranties, covenants and agreements specified
herein in connection with the Merger and the other transactions contemplated
hereby and to prescribe certain conditions to the Merger; and WHEREAS, concurrently with the execution and delivery of this Agreement, and
as a condition and inducement to the willingness of Parent and Merger Sub to
enter into this Agreement, certain shareholders have delivered to Parent and
Merger Sub a support agreement, dated as of the date hereof, in substantially
the form set forth in _Annex A_ (the " _Support Agreement_ "), providing that
such shareholders have, among other things, agreed to (i) tender the shares of
Company Common Stock beneficially owned by them in the Offer, and (ii) support
the Merger and the other Transactions, each on the terms and subject to the
conditions and limitations set forth in the Support Agreement.

 

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing and the representations,
warranties, covenants and agreements set forth in this Agreement, and
intending to be legally bound hereby, the parties hereto agree as follows:

ARTICLE I

 

THE OFFER

 

Section 1.1 _The Offer_.

(a) _Commencement of the Offer_. As promptly as practicable (but in no event
later than fifteen (15) Business Days) after the date hereof, provided that
this Agreement shall not have been terminated in accordance with _Article
VIII_ , Merger Sub shall, and Parent shall cause Merger Sub to, commence
(within the meaning of Rule 14d-2 under the Exchange Act), the Offer at the
Offer Price; provided, however, that Parent and Merger Sub shall not be
deemed to be in breach of this _Section 1.1(a)_ if the Company fails to
comply with its obligations under _Section 1.2_.

(b) _Conditions of Offer_. Subject to the terms and conditions of this
Agreement and to the satisfaction or waiver (as provided in _Section 1.1(c)_
below) of the conditions set forth in  _Annex B_ (the " _Tender Offer
Conditions_ "), Merger Sub shall, and Parent shall cause Merger Sub to, accept
for payment and pay for all shares of Company Common Stock validly tendered
and not validly withdrawn pursuant to the Offer as soon as practicable after
the expiration date of the Offer and in compliance with applicable Law (the
date and time of acceptance for payment, the " _Acceptance Time_ "). Parent
shall provide, or cause to be provided, to Merger Sub on a timely basis funds
necessary to purchase and pay for any and all shares of Company Common Stock
that Merger Sub becomes obligated to accept for payment and purchase pursuant
to the Offer. The Company agrees that no shares of Company Common Stock held
by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries shall be tendered in the Offer.

(c) _Limitations on Amendments and Waivers_. Parent and Merger Sub expressly
reserve the right to waive any of the Tender Offer Conditions, to increase the
Offer Price or to make any other changes in the terms and conditions of the
Offer; provided that, without the prior written consent of the Company,
Parent and Merger Sub shall not: (i) decrease the Offer Price or change the
form of consideration payable in the Offer; (ii) decrease the number of shares
of Company Common Stock subject to or sought to be purchased in the Offer;
(iii) impose

 



2  conditions on the Offer in addition to the Tender Offer Conditions; (iv)
waive or amend the Minimum Condition; (v) amend or supplement any of the other
Tender Offer Conditions or any other term of the Offer in a manner that is
adverse to the holders of shares of Company Common Stock (the " _Company
Shareholders_ "), other than Parent, Merger Sub and any of their respective
Affiliates; or (vi) extend or otherwise change the Expiration Date except as
required or permitted by _Section 1.1(e)_.

(d) _Schedule TO; Offer Documents_. On the date the Offer is commenced,
Merger Sub shall, and Parent shall cause Merger Sub to, file with the
Securities and Exchange Commission (the " _SEC_ ") a Tender Offer Statement on
Schedule TO with respect to the Offer, which Tender Offer Statement shall
include an offer to purchase, letter of transmittal, summary advertisement and
other required ancillary offer documents (such Schedule TO and the documents
included therein pursuant to which the Offer will be made, together with any
supplements or amendments thereto, the " _Offer Documents_ ") and cause the
Offer Documents to be disseminated to the Company Shareholders in accordance

Documents if and to the extent that such information contains any untrue
statement of material fact or omits to state a material fact required to be
stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light
of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, and Parent
and Merger Sub further agree to take all steps necessary to cause the Offer
Documents as so corrected to be filed with the SEC and disseminated to the
Company Shareholders, in each case as and to the extent required by
applicable Law. The Company and its counsel shall be given a reasonable
opportunity to review and comment on the Offer Documents prior to its filing

Merger Sub shall give reasonable and good faith consideration to any comments
made by the Company and its counsel. Parent and Merger Sub shall provide the

written or oral, that Parent, Merger Sub or their counsel may receive from
time to time from the SEC or its staff with respect to the Offer Documents
promptly after receipt of those comments or other communications and (ii) a
reasonable opportunity to review the response of Parent and Merger Sub to
those comments and to provide comments on that response (to which reasonable
and good faith consideration shall be given). Parent and Merger Sub shall use
reasonable best efforts to respond as promptly as practicable to any such
comments.

Initial Expiration Date or such later time and date to which the Offer has
been extended in accordance with this

 



3   _Section 1.1(e)_, the " _Expiration Date_ "). Notwithstanding the
foregoing, (i) if, on the Expiration Date, any of the Tender Offer Conditions

consent, or (y) to the extent requested in writing by the Company no less than
one (1) Business Day prior to the Expiration Date, Merger Sub shall, and
Parent shall cause Merger Sub to, extend the Offer for one or more successive
periods of up to five (5) Business Days (or such longer period as the parties
may agree) per extension until such condition(s) has been satisfied or waived;
_provided_ that Merger Sub may not, and shall not be required to, extend the
Offer beyond June 4, 2012 (the " _Termination Date_ "); and, _provided_ ,
_further_ , if, on any Expiration Date, the Minimum Condition is the only
Tender Offer Condition that has not been satisfied or waived (to the extent
waivable in accordance with the terms and conditions of this Agreement), then
Merger Sub shall, and Parent shall cause Merger Sub to, extend the Offer for
one or more successive periods of up to five (5) Business Days each, with the
total of such extensions not to exceed the earlier to occur of (x) ten (10)
Business Days and (y) the Termination Date; and (ii) Merger Sub shall, and

extensions in this _Section 1.1(e)_ shall be subject to Parents and the
Companys right to terminate the Agreement in accordance with _Section 8.1_.

 

(f) _Termination of the Offer_. The Offer may not be terminated prior to the
Initial Expiration Date, or any subsequent date as of which the Offer is

with _Section 8.1_ hereof. If this Agreement is validly terminated in
accordance with _Section 8.1_ prior to the Acceptance Time, Merger Sub
shall, and Parent shall cause Merger Sub to, (i) promptly (and in any event
within twenty-four (24) hours of such termination) terminate the Offer and
cease to acquire any shares of Company Common Stock pursuant thereto and (ii)
promptly return, and shall cause any depository acting on behalf of Merger Sub
to return, all tendered shares of Company Common Stock to the registered
holders thereof.

 

(g) _Subsequent Offering Period_. If necessary to obtain sufficient shares of
Company Common Stock to reach the Short Form Threshold (without regard to
shares tendered pursuant to guaranteed delivery procedures that have not yet

provide for a subsequent offering period (and one or more extensions thereof)
after the Acceptance Time in accordance with Rule 14d-11 under the Exchange
Act (each a " _Subsequent Offering Period_ "). Subject to the terms and
conditions of this Agreement and the Offer, the Merger Sub shall, and Parent
shall cause Merger Sub to, immediately accept for payment, and pay for, all
shares of Company Common Stock that are validly tendered pursuant to the Offer

file with the SEC a Solicitation/Recommendation Statement on Schedule 14D-9
pertaining to the

 



4  Offer (together with any amendments or supplements thereto, the " _Schedule
14D-9_ ") that, subject to the ability of the Company to make a Recommendation
Withdrawal pursuant to and in accordance with _Section 6.2_, contains the
Company Board Recommendation and shall promptly mail the Schedule 14D-9 to the
Company Shareholders together with the Offer Documents as required by Rule

Schedule 14D-9. Each of the Company, Parent and Merger Sub agrees promptly to
correct any information provided by it for use in the Schedule 14D-9 if and to
the extent that such information contains any untrue statement of material
fact or omits to state a material fact required to be stated therein or
necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of the
circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, and the Company
further agrees to take all steps necessary to cause the Schedule 14D-9 as so
corrected to be filed with the SEC and disseminated to the Company
Shareholders, in each case as and to the extent required by applicable Law.

(b) Except in connection with (i) an Acquisition Proposal that the Companys
Board of Directors determines in good faith (after consultation with its
financial advisor and outside counsel) constitutes or would reasonably be
expected to result in a Superior Proposal or (ii) a Recommendation Withdrawal,
in the case of each of _clauses (i)_ and _(ii)_ , in accordance with

other communications and (ii) a reasonable opportunity to review and provide
comments on the response of the Company to those comments. The Company shall
use reasonable best efforts to respond promptly to any such comments.

 

(c) The Company shall as promptly as practicable after the date of this
Agreement provide to Merger Sub, or cause to be provided to Merger Sub, (i) a
list of the Companys shareholders as of the most recent practicable date as
well as mailing labels and any available listing or computer file containing
the names and addresses of all record holders of Company Common Stock and
lists of securities positions of Company Common Stock held in stock
depositories, and shall promptly furnish Merger Sub with such additional
information and assistance (including updated lists of the Company
Shareholders, mailing labels and lists of securities positions) as Merger Sub
or its agents may reasonably request in order to communicate the Offer to the
Company Shareholders. Except as required by applicable Law, and except as
necessary to communicate regarding the Transactions with the Company
Shareholders, Parent and Merger Sub (and their respective Representatives)
shall hold in confidence the information contained in any such labels,
listings and files, shall use such information solely in connection with the
Transactions, and, if this Agreement is terminated or the Offer is otherwise
terminated or withdrawn for any reason, shall promptly deliver or cause to be
delivered to the Company or destroy all copies of such information, labels,

5 Section 1.3 _Top-Up Option_.

 

(a) The Company hereby grants to Parent and/or Merger Sub an irrevocable
option (the " _Top-Up Option_ "), exercisable only upon the terms and subject
to the conditions set forth in this Agreement, to purchase from the Company,
at a price per share equal to the Offer Price paid in the Offer, up to that
number of newly issued shares of Company Common Stock (the " _Top-Up Option
Shares_ ") that, when added to the number of shares of Company Common Stock
owned by Parent (or any of its Subsidiaries) or Merger Sub at the time of
exercise of the Top-Up Option, would constitute one (1) share more than
ninety percent (90%) of the shares of Company Common Stock then outstanding on
a fully-diluted basis ("on a fully-diluted basis" meaning the number of shares
of Company Common Stock then issued and outstanding, plus all shares of
Company Common Stock that the Company may be required to issue as of such date
pursuant to options (whether or not then vested or exercisable), rights,
convertible or exchangeable securities (only to the extent then convertible
or exchangeable into shares of Company Common Stock) or similar obligations
then outstanding, and after giving effect to the issuance of the Top-Up Option
Shares, but excluding from Parents (and any of its Subsidiaries) and
Merger Subs ownership, but not from the outstanding shares of Company Common
Stock, shares of Company Common Stock tendered pursuant to guaranteed delivery
procedures that have not yet been delivered in settlement or satisfaction of
such guarantee) (the " _Short Form Threshold_ "). Parent may assign the Top-
Up Option and its rights and obligations pursuant to this _Section 1.3_, in
its sole discretion, to any of its Subsidiaries, including Merger Sub.

 

(b) The Top-Up Option may be exercised at any time after consummation of the
Offer and prior to the earlier of (i) the Effective Time and (ii) the
termination of this Agreement in accordance with its terms; provided, however,
the Top-Up Option shall not be exercisable to the extent (A) the number of
shares of Company Common Stock subject to the Top-Up Option exceeds the
number of authorized and unissued shares of Company Common Stock available for
issuance (less the maximum number of shares of Company Common Stock
potentially necessary for issuance with respect to outstanding Company Options
and other obligations of the Company), (B) any Restraint or Law shall
prohibit the exercise of the Top-Up Option or the delivery of the Top-Up
Option Shares, (C) immediately after such exercise and issuance of shares of
Company Common Stock pursuant thereto, the Short Form Threshold would not be
reached or (D) Merger Sub has not accepted for payment all shares of Company
Common Stock validly tendered in the Offer (or during any subsequent offering
period) and not validly withdrawn. The Top-Up Option shall be exercisable
only once.

(c) In the event that Parent or Merger Sub wishes to exercise the Top-
Up Option, Parent or Merger Sub shall give the Company written notice (i)
specifying the number of shares of Company Common Stock that are or will be
owned by Parent or any of its Subsidiaries or Merger Sub immediately following
the Acceptance Time (or any closing relating to a subsequent offering
period), (ii) specifying a place and a time for the closing of the purchase
and (iii) undertaking to effect the Merger pursuant to _Article II_ (including
the proviso in  _Section 2.2_) as promptly as practicable following the
acquisition of the Top-Up Option Shares. The Company shall, as soon as
practicable following receipt of such notice, deliver written notice to Parent
or 

 



6  Merger Sub specifying the estimated number of Top-Up Option Shares. Prior to
the closing of the purchase of the Top-Up Option Shares, the Company shall (A)
cause its transfer agent to certify in writing to Purchaser the number of
Shares issued and outstanding (x) as of immediately prior to the closing of
the Top-Up Option and (y) after giving effect to the issuance of the Top-Up
Option Shares and, (B) based thereon, determine the final number of Top-Up
Option Shares. At the closing of the purchase of the Top-Up Option Shares, (i)
Parent or Merger Sub shall pay (or cause to be paid) to the Company the
aggregate purchase price payable for the Top-Up Option Shares (in an amount
equal to the product of (x) the number of shares of Company Common Stock
purchased pursuant to the Top-Up Option and (y) the Offer Price (which amount
may be paid, at the election of Parent or Merger Sub, either in cash (by wire
transfer or cashiers check) or by execution and delivery of a promissory note
having a principal amount equal to the aggregate purchase price for the Top Up
Option Shares, or any combination thereof, and (ii) the Company shall cause
the Top-Up Option Shares to be issued to Parent (or any of its Subsidiaries
designated by Parent) or Merger Sub, represented by either certificates or
book-entry shares, at the sole option of Parent or Merger Sub. Any promissory
note issued pursuant to the immediately preceding sentence shall be in the
form attached as _Annex C_ hereto and shall include the following terms: (A)
the maturity date shall be one year after issuance, (B) the unpaid principal
amount of the promissory note shall accrue simple interest at a per annum
rate of 1.5% per annum, (C) the promissory note may be prepaid in whole or in
part at any time, without penalty or prior notice, (D) the promissory note
shall be with full recourse and shall be fully secured by the Top-Up Option
Shares, (E) the promissory note shall be nonnegotiable and nontransferable and
(F) the promissory note shall have no other material terms. The parties will
cooperate to ensure that the issuance of the Top-Up Option Shares is
accomplished consistent with applicable Laws, including compliance with an
applicable exemption from registration under the Securities Act. The Top-Up
Option shall terminate concurrently with the termination of this Agreement in
accordance with its terms.

(d) Parent and/or Merger Sub acknowledges that the Top-Up Option Shares which
Parent (or any of its Subsidiaries) or Merger Sub may acquire upon exercise of
the Top-Up Option shall not be registered under the Securities Act, and shall
be issued in reliance upon an exemption for transactions not involving a
public offering. Parent and/or Merger Sub agrees that the Top-Up Option, and
the Top-Up Option Shares to be acquired upon exercise of the Top-Up Option, if
any, are being and shall be acquired by Parent (or any of its Subsidiaries) or
Merger Sub for the purpose of investment and not with a view to, or for
resale in connection with, any distribution thereof (within the meaning of the
Securities Act). Each of Parent and Merger Sub hereby represents and warrants
to the Company that Merger Sub is, and will be, upon the purchase of the Top-
Up Option Shares, an "accredited investor," as defined in Rule 501 of
Regulation D under the Securities Act.

Section 1.4 _Board of Directors_.

(a) Promptly upon the Acceptance Time and from time to time and at all times
thereafter, Parent shall be entitled to elect or designate such number of
directors, rounded up to the next whole number, on the Companys Board of
Directors as shall give Parent representation on the Companys Board of
Directors equal to the product of the total number of directors on the
Companys Board of Directors (giving effect to the directors elected or
designated by Parent pursuant to this _Section 1.4_) multiplied by the
percentage that the aggregate number of Company

 



7  Common Stock then owned directly or indirectly by Parent bears to the total
number of shares of Company Common Stock then outstanding. After the
Acceptance Time, the Company shall, upon request by Parent, take all actions
as are necessary to enable Parents designees to be so elected or appointed to
the Companys Board of Directors, including by promptly filling vacancies or
newly created directorships on the Companys Board of Directors, promptly
increasing the size of the Companys Board of Directors (including by amending
the by-laws of the Company if necessary to increase the size of the Companys
Board of Directors) and/or promptly securing the resignations of such number
of its incumbent directors as is necessary to provide Parent with such level
of representation, and shall cause Parents designees to be so elected or
appointed at such time (the date on which Parents designees are so elected
or appointed to the Companys Board of Directors, the " _Director Appointment
Date_ "). Subject to _Section 1.4(b)_, after the Acceptance Time, the Company
shall also, upon Parents request, cause the directors elected or designated
by Parent to the Companys Board of Directors to serve on and constitute the
same percentage as such individuals represent of the entire Board of Directors
of the Company (but not less than a majority) (rounded up to the next whole
number) of: (i) each committee of the Companys Board of Directors and (ii)
each board of directors (or similar body) and each committee thereof (or
similar body) of each Subsidiary of the Company, in each case to the extent
permitted by applicable Law and the rules of NASDAQ. The provisions of this
_Section 1.4(a)_ are in addition to and shall not limit any rights that
Parent, Merger Sub or any of their respective Affiliates may have as a
record holder or beneficial owner of Company Common Stock as a matter of
applicable Law with respect to the election of directors or otherwise. The
Companys obligations to appoint or elect Parents designees to the Companys
Board of Directors shall be subject to Section 14(f) of the Exchange Act and
Rule 14f-1 promulgated thereunder. At the request of Parent, the Company shall
take all actions necessary to effect any such appointment or election of
Parents designees, including filing with the SEC and mailing to the Company
Shareholders the information required by Section 14(f) of the Exchange Act and
Rule 14f-l promulgated thereunder which, unless Parent otherwise elects, shall
be so mailed together with the Schedule 14D-9. Parent shall supply to the
Company, and, (with respect to information furnished by Parent to the Company
in writing) be solely responsible for, all information with respect to itself
and its officers, directors and Affiliates as is required by such Section and
Rule.

(b) After Parents designees are appointed or elected to, and constitute
a majority of, the Companys Board of Directors pursuant to _Section
1.4(a)_, and prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall cause the
Companys Board of Directors to maintain at least three directors (selected by
the members of the Companys Board of Directors on the date hereof) who are
members of the Companys Board of Directors on the date hereof, each of whom
shall be an "independent director" as defined by Rule 5605(a)(2) of the
NASDAQ Marketplace Rules and eligible to serve on the Companys audit
committee under the Exchange Act and NASDAQ Marketplace Rules and, at least
one of whom shall be an "audit committee financial expert" as defined in Item
407(d)(5) of Regulation S-K and the instructions thereto (the " _Continuing
Directors_ "); provided, however, that if the number of Continuing Directors
is reduced below three for any reason, the remaining Continuing Directors
shall be entitled to elect or designate a person meeting the foregoing
criteria to fill such vacancy who shall be deemed to be a Continuing Director
for purposes of this Agreement or, if no Continuing Directors then remain, the
other directors shall designate three persons meeting the foregoing criteria
to fill such vacancies, and such persons shall be deemed to be Continuing
Directors for purposes of this

 



8  Agreement. The Company and the Companys Board of Directors shall promptly
take all action as may be necessary to comply with their obligations under
this _Section 1.4(b)_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in
this Agreement, in the event that Parents designees are elected or appointed
to the Companys Board of Directors prior to the Effective Time pursuant to
_Section 1.4(a)_, the approval of a majority of such Continuing Directors
(or the sole Continuing Director if there shall be only one (1) Continuing
Director) shall be required in order to (i) amend, modify, supplement or
terminate this Agreement, or agree or consent to any amendment, modification,
supplement or termination of this Agreement, in any case on behalf of the
Company, (ii) extend the time for performance of, or waive, any of the
obligations or other acts of Parent or Merger Sub under this Agreement, (iii)
waive or exercise any of the Companys rights under this Agreement, (iv) waive
any condition to the Companys obligations under this Agreement, (v) amend the
Company Charter or the Company Bylaws, (vi) authorize any agreement between
the Company or any of the Subsidiaries of the Company, on the one hand, and
Parent, Merger Sub or any of their Affiliates, on the other hand, that is
effective before the Effective Time or (vii) make any other determination
with respect to any action to be taken or not to be taken by or on behalf of
the Company relating to this Agreement or the Transactions. For purposes of
considering any matter set forth in this _Section 1.4(b)_, the Continuing
Directors shall be permitted to meet without the presence of the other
directors. The Continuing Directors shall have the authority to retain such
counsel (which may include current counsel to the Company) and other advisors
at the expense of the Company as determined by the Continuing Directors and
shall have the authority to institute any action on behalf of the Company to
enforce performance of this Agreement or any of the Companys rights
hereunder.

Benefit Plan or related trust) shall be converted into and shall thereafter
represent the right to receive an amount in cash equal to the Offer Price

Company Shareholders Meeting in accordance with the applicable provisions of
the TBCA.

(a) _Exchange Agent_. At or prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall deposit

Exchange Fund is at all times until the twelve (12) month anniversary of the
Effective Time maintained at a level sufficient for the Exchange Agent to make
such payments under _Section 2.8(b)_. Nothing contained in this _Section
2.12(a)_ and no investment losses resulting from investment of the funds
deposited with the Exchange Agent shall diminish the rights of any holder of
Company Common Stock to receive the Merger Consideration.

(b) _Exchange Procedures_.

(i) _Certificates_. Parent shall cause the Exchange Agent to mail (or in the
case of The Depository Trust Company on behalf of "street" holders, deliver),
as soon as reasonably practicable after the Effective Time, to each holder of

such other provisions (including customary provisions with respect to delivery
of an "agents message" with respect to Book-Entry Shares) as are reasonably
satisfactory to Parent) and (ii) instructions for use in effecting the
surrender of the Certificates in exchange for the Merger Consideration. Upon
surrender of a Certificate for cancellation to the Exchange Agent, together
with such letter of transmittal, duly executed, and such other documents as
may reasonably be required by the Exchange Agent, the holder of such
Certificate shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor, and Parent
shall cause the Exchange Agent to pay and deliver in exchange thereof as
promptly as practicable, the cash amount equal to (x) the number of shares of
Company Common Stock represented by such Certificate multiplied by (y) the
Offer Price, and the Certificate so surrendered shall forthwith be cancelled.
In the event of a transfer of ownership of Company Common Stock that is not
registered in the transfer records of the Company, payment may be made and
shares may be issued to a Person other than the Person in whose name the
Certificate so surrendered is registered, if such Certificate shall be
properly endorsed or otherwise be in proper form for transfer and the Person
requesting such payment shall pay any transfer or other Taxes required by
reason of the payment to a Person other than the registered holder of such
Certificate or establish to the satisfaction of Parent that such Tax has been
paid or is not applicable. Until surrendered as contemplated by this 
_Section 2.12_, each Certificate shall be deemed at any time after the
Effective Time to represent only the right to receive upon such surrender the
cash portion of the Merger Consideration into which the shares of Company
Common Stock theretofore represented by such Certificate have been converted
pursuant to _Section 2.8(b)_. No interest shall be paid or accrue on any cash
payable upon surrender of any Certificate.

 

(ii) _Book-Entry Shares_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained
in this Agreement, any holder of Book-Entry Shares shall not be required to
deliver a Certificate or an executed letter of transmittal to the Exchange
Agent to receive the Merger Consideration that such holder is entitled to
receive pursuant to this _Article II_. In 

 



12  lieu thereof, each holder of record of one or more Book-Entry Shares whose
shares of Company Common Stock were converted into the right to receive the
Merger Consideration pursuant to  _Section 2.8(b)_ shall automatically upon
the Effective Time (or, at any later time at which such Book-Entry Shares
shall be so converted) be entitled to receive, and Parent shall cause the
Exchange Agent to pay and deliver as promptly as practicable after the
Effective Time, in respect of each Book-Entry Share held by such holder the
cash amount equal to (x) the number of shares of Company Common Stock
represented by such Book-Entry Shares multiplied by (y) the Offer Price, and
the Book-Entry Shares of such holder shall forthwith be cancelled. No interest
shall be paid or accrue on any cash payable upon cancellation of any Book-
Entry Shares.

 

(c) _No Further Ownership Rights in Company Common Stock; Closing of Transfer
Books_. The Merger Consideration, when paid in accordance with the terms of
this _Article II_ upon the surrender of the Certificates (or, automatically,
in the case of the Book-Entry Shares), shall be deemed to have been paid in
full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to such shares of Company Common
Stock previously pertaining to such Certificates. After the Effective Time
there shall be no further registration of transfers on the stock transfer
books of the Surviving Corporation of shares of Company Common Stock that
were outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time. If, after the
Effective Time, any Certificates formerly representing shares of Company
Common Stock are presented to the Surviving Corporation or the Exchange Agent
for any reason, they shall be cancelled and exchanged as provided in this
_Article II_.

(d) _Termination of Exchange Fund_. Any portion of the Exchange Fund that
remains undistributed to the holders of Company Common Stock for twelve (12)
months after the Effective Time shall be delivered to the Surviving
Corporation, upon demand, and any holder of Company Common Stock who has
not theretofore complied with this _Article II_ shall thereafter look only to
the Surviving Corporation for payment of its claim for the Merger
Consideration.

(e) _No Liability_. None of Parent, Merger Sub, the Company, the Surviving
Corporation, the Exchange Agent or any other Person shall be liable to any
Person in respect of any cash from the Exchange Fund (including any amounts
delivered to Parent in accordance with _Section 2.12(d)_) properly delivered
to a public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or
similar Law.

 

(f) _Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates_. In the event any Certificate
shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of
that fact by the Person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or
destroyed and, to the extent required by Parent, the posting by such Person of
a bond in reasonable amount as indemnity against any claim that may be made
against it with respect to such Certificate, the Exchange Agent shall issue
and pay in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate the Merger
Consideration that would be payable or deliverable in respect thereof pursuant
to this Agreement had such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate been
surrendered as provided in this _Article II_.

(g)  _Investment_. The Exchange Agent shall invest any cash included in the
Exchange Fund, as directed by Parent, on a daily basis. Any interest and other
income resulting from such investments shall be paid to the Surviving
Corporation;  _provided_ that no losses on any investment made pursuant to
this _Section 2.12(g)_ shall affect the Merger Consideration payable

 



13  to holders of Company Common Stock entitled to receive such consideration,
and following any such losses, Parent shall promptly cause to be provided
additional funds to the Exchange Agent for the benefit of holders of shares
of Company Common Stock entitled to receive such consideration in the amount
of any such losses or if for any reason such funds are unavailable for payment
to the holders of shares of Company Common Stock.

 

(h) _Withholdings_. Each of Parent and the Exchange Agent shall be entitled to
deduct and withhold from the consideration otherwise payable to any holder of
Company Common Stock and any holder of Company Options or Company Restricted
Shares pursuant to this _Article II_ such amounts as it is required to deduct
and withhold with respect to the making of such payment under the Code or
under any provision of state, local or foreign Tax Law. Any amount properly
deducted or withheld pursuant to this _Section 2.12(h)_ shall be treated for
all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the holder of Company
Common Stock, Company Options or Company Restricted Shares in respect of which
such deduction or withholding was made. Parent shall pay, or shall cause to be
paid, all amounts so deducted or withheld to the appropriate Taxing
Authority within the period required under applicable Law.

Section 2.13 _Treatment of Stock Plans_.

 

(a) Each option to purchase shares of Company Common Stock granted under a
Company Stock Plan, other than purchase rights granted under the Company
Ownership Plan, that is outstanding immediately prior to the Acceptance Time
(each a " _Company Option_ "), whether or not then vested and exercisable,
shall become fully vested and exercisable upon the occurrence of
the Acceptance Time. With respect to such Company Options:

(i) each unexercised Company Option for which, as of the Effective Time, the
Offer Price exceeds the exercise price per Share shall be canceled at the
Effective Time and, in exchange therefor, the Company shall pay to each former
holder of such Company Option as soon as practicable, but in no event later
than fifteen (15) Business Days following the Effective Time, an amount in
cash (without interest, and subject to deduction for any required withholding
Tax) equal to the product of (1) the excess, if any, of the Merger
Consideration over the exercise price per Share under such Company Option and
(2) the number of shares of Company Common Stock subject to such Company
Option; and

(ii) each Company Option that is outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time for which, as of the Effective Time, the Offer Price does not
exceed the exercise price per Share shall be cancelled at the Effective Time
without any cash payment being made in respect thereof.

(b) Each share of Company Common Stock that, immediately prior to the
Acceptance Time, is subject to forfeiture, vesting or other restrictions that
was granted pursuant to any Company Stock Plan (a " _Company Restricted Share_
") shall become fully vested at the Acceptance Time (and subject to
forfeiture or surrender to the Company, to the extent necessary to satisfy any
Tax withholding) and, to the extent still outstanding at the Effective Time,
shall be cancelled at the Effective Time (the " _Canceled Restricted Awards_
"), and, in exchange therefor, the Company shall pay to each former holder of
any such Canceled Restricted Awards, as soon

 



14  as practicable but in no event later than fifteen (15) Business Days
following the Effective Time, an amount in cash (without interest, and subject
to deduction for any required withholding Tax) equal to the product of (1)
the Merger Consideration and (2) the number of shares of Company Common Stock
subject to such Canceled Restricted Awards.

(c) With respect to the Company Ownership Plan, after the date of this
Agreement, (i) participation in the Company Ownership Plan shall be limited to
those employees who are participants on the date of this Agreement, (ii)
except to the extent necessary to maintain the status of the Company Ownership
Plan as an "employee stock purchase plan" within the meaning of Section 423 of
the Code and the Treasury Regulations thereunder, participants may not
increase their payroll deduction elections or rate of contributions from those
in effect on the date of this Agreement, (iii) no contribution period shall be
commenced after the date of this Agreement, (iv) the Company Ownership Plan
shall terminate, effective upon the earlier of the first purchase date
following the date of this Agreement or the last Business Day before the
Acceptance Time, but subsequent to the exercise of purchase rights on such
purchase date (in accordance with the terms of the Company Ownership Plan) or
termination of such purchase rights on such last Business Day (as provided for
in the following clause (v)), as applicable, and (v) if the Company
Ownership Plan remains in effect on the last Business Day before the
Acceptance Time, each purchase right under the Company Ownership Plan
outstanding on such day shall be terminated and the balance in each
participants contribution account shall be paid to such participant in
accordance with the terms of the Company Ownership Plan.

(d) As soon as practicable following the date of this Agreement, but in any
event prior to the Acceptance Time, the Company, the Board of Directors of the
Company or the compensation committee of the Board of Directors of the
Company, as applicable, shall adopt any resolutions and take any actions
which are reasonably necessary in accordance with applicable Law, and, as
applicable, the Company Stock Plans, each agreement evidencing a grant of
Company Options (each, a " _Company Option Agreement_ ") and each
agreement evidencing a grant of Company Restricted Shares (each, a " _Company
Restricted Share Agreement_ ") (including obtaining necessary consents) to (i)
effectuate the provisions of this _Section 2.13_ and (ii) terminate, upon
the Effective Time, each Company Stock Plan, each Company Option Agreement and
each Company Restricted Share Agreement, such that at the Effective Time and
upon the payments contemplated hereunder, no Person shall have any right to
purchase or receive any equity or payment interest, or right convertible into
or exercisable for any equity or payment interest or exit payment from or of
the Company or the Surviving Corporation; _provided_ , _however_ , that,
notwithstanding the foregoing _clause (ii)_ , the Company Ownership Plan
shall be terminated pursuant to _Section 2.13(c)_ above.

Disclosure Schedule shall be deemed disclosure with respect to any section of
this Agreement or any other section or subsection of the Company Disclosure
Schedule to which the relevance of such disclosure is reasonably apparent on
its face and that the mere inclusion of an item in such Company Disclosure
Schedule as an exception to a representation or warranty shall not be deemed
an admission that such item represents a material exception or material fact,
event or circumstance or that such item has had, would have or would
reasonably be expected to have a Company Material Adverse Effect), the
Company represents and warrants to Parent and Merger Sub as follows:

Section 3.1  _Corporate Organization_.

(a) Each of the Company and its Subsidiaries is a corporation or other entity
duly organized, validly existing and, to the extent applicable, in good
standing under the Laws of the jurisdiction of its organization and has the
requisite corporate or other entity power and authority to own, lease and
operate all of its properties and assets and to carry on its business as it
is now being conducted. Each of the Company and its Subsidiaries is duly
licensed or qualified to do business, and is in good standing, in each
jurisdiction where the nature of the business conducted by it or
the character or location of the properties and assets owned or leased by it
makes such licensing or qualification necessary, except where the failure to
be so licensed, qualified or in good standing does not and would not
reasonably be expected to have a Company Material Adverse Effect. The copies

Restated Bylaws (the " _Company Bylaws_ ") of the Company, as most recently
filed with the Company SEC Documents, are true, complete and correct copies
of such documents as in effect and as amended as of the date of this
Agreement. The Company Charter and the Company Bylaws are in full force and
effect and the Company is not in violation of any of the provisions of the
Company Charter or the Company Bylaws. The Company has made available to
Parent true, complete and correct copies of the certificates of incorporation
and bylaws (or comparable organizational documents) of each of the Companys
Subsidiaries, in each case as amended as of the date of this Agreement. Such
organizational documents are in full force and effect and none of the

SEC Documents as of such respective dates or, if amended, as of the date of
such amendment, contained any untrue statement of a material fact or omitted
to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order
to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which
they were made, not misleading. As of the date of this Agreement, there are no
outstanding or unresolved comments received from the SEC staff with respect to
the Company SEC Documents. To the Knowledge of the Company, none of the

notes thereto) of the Company (the " _Company SEC Financial Statements_ ")
included in the Company SEC Documents (if amended, as of the date of the last
such amendment) comply in all material respects with applicable accounting
requirements and the published rules and regulations of the SEC with respect
thereto. The Company SEC Financial Statements fairly present, in all material
respects, the consolidated financial position of the Company and its

consolidated results of their operations and their consolidated cash flows for
the respective periods then ended (subject, in the case of the unaudited
statements, to normal year-end audit adjustments, none of which, individually
or in the aggregate, has been or will be material to the Company and its
Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, and to the absence of

 



20  information or notes not required by GAAP to be included in interim
financial statements) in conformity with GAAP (except, in the case of the
unaudited statements, as permitted by the SEC) applied on a consistent basis
during the periods involved (except as may be indicated therein or in the
notes thereto).

commitment to become a party to, any joint venture, off-balance sheet
partnership or any similar contract, including any contract or arrangement
relating to any transaction or relationship between or among the Company and
any of its Subsidiaries, on the one hand, and any unconsolidated Affiliate, on
the other hand, including any structured finance, special purpose or limited
purpose entity or Person, or any "off-balance sheet arrangements" (as defined
in Item 303(a) of Regulation S-K of the SEC), where the result, purpose or
effect of such contract is to avoid disclosure of any material transaction
involving, or material liabilities of, the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
in the Companys or any of its Subsidiaries published financial statements or
any Company SEC Documents.

(d) Each of the principal executive officer of the Company and the principal
financial officer of the Company (or each former principal executive officer
of the Company and each former principal financial officer of the Company, as
applicable) has made all certifications required by Rule 13a-14 or 15d-14
under the Exchange Act and Sections 302 and 906 of SOX, in each case, with
respect to the Company SEC Documents, and the statements contained in such
certifications were complete, correct and accurate in all material respects on
the date such certifications were made. For purposes of this Agreement,
"principal executive officer" and "principal financial officer" shall have
the meanings given to such terms in SOX.

(e) The Company has established and maintains a system of "internal control
over financial reporting" (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f)
promulgated by the SEC under the Exchange Act) sufficient to provide
reasonable assurance (i) that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit
preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP, consistently
applied, (ii) that transactions are executed only in accordance with the
authorization of management or the Board of Directors of the Company, and
(iii) regarding prevention or timely detection of the unauthorized
acquisition, use or disposition of the Companys assets.

(f) The Company has established and maintains "disclosure controls and
procedures" (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) promulgated by the
SEC under the Exchange Act); such disclosure controls and procedures are
reasonably designed to ensure that information relating to the Company and
the Subsidiaries of the Company required to be disclosed in the Companys

"employee benefit plan," as defined in Section 3(3) of the Employee
Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (" _ERISA_ ") or similar provisions of
non-U.S. Law, whether or not subject to ERISA, and each other pension, profit-

Subsidiaries or which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries has any
obligation to maintain, sponsor or contribute, or with respect to which the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries would incur any direct or indirect

the Code, and the trust (if any) forming a part thereof, has received a
favorable determination letter from the IRS (or opinion letter upon which the
Company is entitled to rely) that the Company Benefit Plan is so qualified,
and, to the Companys Knowledge, there are no existing circumstances or any
events that would reasonably be expected to adversely affect the qualified
status of any such plan in a manner which would reasonably be expected to have
a Company Material Adverse Effect. Each Company Benefit Plan has been
administered and operated in accordance with its terms and with applicable
Law, except as do not and would not reasonably be expected to have a Company
Material Adverse Effect. All contributions or other amounts which the Company
was required to make to Company Benefit Plans on or prior to the Closing Date
have been paid, except where any failure to do so would not reasonably be
expected to be material to the Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a
whole. 

(c) No liability under Title IV or Section 302 of ERISA has been incurred by
the Company or any ERISA Affiliate that has not been satisfied in full, and,
to the Companys Knowledge, no condition exists that presents a material risk
to the Company or any ERISA Affiliate of incurring any such liability
(exclusive of the liability to pay insurance premiums to the Pension Benefit
Guaranty Corporation (" _PBGC_ ") under Title IV of ERISA), except as would
not reasonably be expected to have a Company Material Adverse Effect. No
prohibited transaction (within the meaning of Section 406 of ERISA or Section
4975 of the Code) has occurred with respect to any Company Benefit Plan. As
used in this Agreement, " _ERISA Affiliate_ " means any Person which is (or at
any relevant time was or will be) a member of a "controlled group of
corporations" with, under "common control" with, or a member of an "affiliated
service group" with the Company as such terms are defined in Section 414(b),
(c), (m) or (o) of the Code.

 

(d) There are no pending actions or claims with respect to any of the Company
Benefit Plans by any employee or otherwise involving any such plan or the

not and would not reasonably be expected to have a Company Material Adverse
Effect.

 

(e) No Company Benefit Plan is a "multiemployer plan" within the meaning of
Section 4001(a)(3) of ERISA or is a "multiple employer plan" within the
meaning of Section 4063 or 4064 of ERISA. Neither the Company nor any ERISA
Affiliate has at any time during the last six (6) years contributed to or been
obligated to contribute to any such type of plan. No Company Benefit Plan is
an "employee pension benefit plan" (as defined in Section 3(2) of ERISA) that
is subject to Title IV of ERISA or Section 412 of the Code or is otherwise a
"defined benefit plan" (as defined in Section 3(35) of ERISA).

(f) Except as set forth in _Section 3.15_ of the Company
Disclosure Schedule, no Company Benefit Plan provides for or promises
medical, surgical, hospitalization, death, disability, life insurance or
similar benefits (whether or not insured) for current or former employees,
officers, service providers or directors of the Company for periods extending
beyond their retirement or other termination of service, other than coverage
mandated by applicable provisions of the Consolidated Omnibus Budget
Reconciliation Act of 1985, as amended and the regulations issued thereunder
or applicable state Law.

 



27 (g) Except as provided in this Agreement, as set forth in _Section 3.15_ of
the Company Disclosure Schedule or as required by applicable Law, the
consummation of the Merger and the other Transactions will not, either alone
or in combination with another event, (i) entitle any current or former
director, officer or employee of the Company or of any of its Subsidiaries to
severance pay or any similar payment or (ii) result in any payment becoming
due, accelerate the time of payment, funding or vesting, or increase the
amount of compensation due to any such director, officer or employee. The
Company is not a party to any contract or arrangement that would result,
separately or in the aggregate, in the payment of any "excess parachute
payments" within the meaning of Section 280G of the Code, and the
consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement will not be a
factor causing payments to be made by the Company to be non-deductible (in
whole or in part) under Section 280G of the Code.

 

(h) There are no pension, unemployment insurance, medical insurance, work
injury insurance, housing provident fund, welfare, bonus, stock purchase,
stock ownership, stock option, deferred compensation, incentive, severance,
termination or other compensation plan or arrangement, or other material
employee fringe benefit plan presently maintained by, or contributed to by the
Company or any ERISA Affiliate for the benefit of any employee of the Company
or any ERISA Affiliate, or with respect to which the Company or any ERISA
Affiliate has any liability, including any plans required to be maintained or
contributed to by the Law of the relevant jurisdiction, in any case for
purposes of the arrangements listed in this _Section 3.15(h)_ that are
maintained outside the jurisdiction of the United States.

 

(i) Each Company Benefit Plan that is a "nonqualified deferred compensation
plan" within the meaning of Treasury Regulation Section 1.409A-1(a)(1)(a) (a
" _Nonqualified Deferred Compensation Plan_ ") (i) was operated in compliance
with Section 409A of the Code between January 1, 2005 and December 31, 2008,
based upon a good faith, reasonable interpretation of (A) Section 409A of the
Code and (B) the final Treasury Regulations and other guidance issued by the
IRS thereunder, to the extent applicable (clauses (A) and (B), together, the "
_409A Authorities_ ") and (ii) has been operated in compliance with the 409A
Authorities since January 1, 2009, except, in either case, as would not
reasonably be expected to have a Company Material Adverse Effect. Each
Nonqualified Deferred Compensation Plan has been in documentary compliance
with the 409A Authorities since January 1, 2009, except as would not
reasonably be expected to have a Company Material Adverse Effect. The Company
has no liability or obligation to provide any gross-up of the Tax imposed by
Section 409A(a)(1)(B) of the Code.

(j) This _Section 3.15_ contains the sole and exclusive representations and
warranties of the Company regarding Company Benefits Plans or ERISA matters,
or liabilities or obligations, or compliance with Laws, relating thereto.

(a) If the approval of this Agreement by the Companys shareholders is
required by applicable Law, the Company shall prepare and, as soon as
practicable following the Acceptance Time (and in any event, within ten (10)
Business Days thereof), file with the SEC the proxy statement that will be
provided to the Company Shareholders in connection with the solicitation of
proxies for use at the Company Shareholder Meeting, if any (collectively, as
amended or supplemented from time to time, the " _Proxy Statement_ "), for the
solicitation of proxies from the Company Shareholders for use at the Company
Shareholder Meeting. The Parent and Merger Sub, as the case may be, shall
furnish all information concerning Parent and Merger Sub (and their respective
Affiliates, if applicable) as the Company may reasonably request
in connection with the preparation and filing with the SEC of the Proxy
Statement. Subject to applicable Law, the Company shall cause the Proxy
Statement to be filed in definitive form with the SEC and to be disseminated
to the Company Shareholders, in each case, as promptly as practicable
following the filing thereof with the SEC and confirmation from the SEC that
it will not comment on, or that it has no additional comments on, the Proxy
Statement (and, in any event, within five (5) Business Days of such
confirmation from the SEC). Each of the Company, Parent and Merger Sub shall
promptly correct any information provided by it or any of its respective
directors, officers, employees, Affiliates, agents or other representatives
for use in the Proxy Statement if and to the extent that such information
contains any untrue statement of material fact or omits to state a material
fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the
statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made,
not misleading. The Company shall take all steps necessary to cause the Proxy
Statement as so corrected to be filed with the SEC and disseminated to the
Company Shareholders, in each case as and to the extent required by
applicable Laws. The Company shall provide Parent, Merger Sub and their
counsel a reasonable opportunity to review and comment on the Proxy Statement
prior to the filing thereof with the SEC, and the Company shall give
reasonable and good faith consideration to any comments made by Parent, Merger
Sub and their counsel (it being understood that Parent, Merger Sub and their
counsel shall provide any comments thereon as soon as reasonably practicable).
The Company shall provide in writing to Parent, Merger Sub and their counsel
any comments or other communications, whether written or oral, the Company or
its counsel may receive from the SEC or its staff with respect to the Proxy
Statement promptly after such receipt, and the Company shall provide Parent,
Merger Sub and their counsel a reasonable opportunity to review and comment on
any response to any such comments of the SEC or its staff, and the Company
shall give reasonable and good faith consideration to any comments made by
Parent, Merger Sub and their counsel, including to confirm that the parties
are treating the SECs or its staffs review and comments consistently (it
being understood that Parent, Merger Sub and their counsel shall provide any
comments thereon as soon as reasonably practicable).

 



46 (b) If required by applicable Law in order to consummate the Merger, the
Company, acting through the Companys Board of Directors, shall, as soon as
practicable following the Acceptance Time (and the expiration of any
subsequent offering period), in accordance with applicable Law and the Company
Charter and Company Bylaws: (a) duly call, give notice of, convene and hold a
meeting of the shareholders of the Company for the purpose of obtaining the
Company Shareholder Approval (the " _Company Shareholders Meeting_ "), and (b)
subject to the ability of the Company to make a Recommendation Withdrawal
pursuant to and in accordance with _Section 6.2(a)_, include in the Proxy
Statement the Company Board Recommendation. Unless such Company Board
Recommendation shall have been modified or withdrawn pursuant to and in
accordance with _Section 6.2_, the Company shall take all action that is both
reasonable and lawful to solicit from its shareholders proxies in favor of the
proposal to adopt and approve this Agreement and the Merger and shall take
all other reasonable actions necessary or advisable to secure the vote or
consent of the shareholders of the Company that are required by the NASDAQ
rules or the TBCA. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this
Agreement, (A) the Company may adjourn or postpone the Company Shareholders
Meeting with Parents consent (which consent shall not be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned or delayed), as necessary to ensure that any required
supplement or amendment to the Proxy Statement is provided to the Companys
shareholders within a reasonable amount of time in advance of the Company
Shareholders Meeting, and (B) the Company shall not be required to call,
give notice of or convene the Company Shareholders Meeting or mail the Proxy
Statement, in each case prior to the No-Shop Period Start Date.

Section 6.2 _No Solicitation_.

(a) _The Go-Shop Period_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained
in this Agreement, during the period beginning on the date of this Agreement
and continuing until 11:59 p.m. (New York City time) on March 6, 2012 (the "
_Go-Shop Period_ "), the Company and its Subsidiaries and their respective
directors, officers, employees, Affiliates, investment bankers, attorneys,
accountants and other advisors or representatives (collectively, "
_Representatives_ ") shall have the right to: (i) initiate, solicit,

by way of providing access to non-public information or the business,
properties, assets or personnel of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to
any Person and its Representatives, its Affiliates and its prospective equity
and debt financing sources pursuant to (but only pursuant to) a
confidentiality agreement that contains terms limiting the use and disclosure
of non-public information and imposing standstill obligations that, in each
case, are not less favorable in the aggregate to the Company than those
contained in the Confidentiality Agreement and that complies with the last
sentence of this _clause (a)_ (it being understood that such confidentiality
agreement need not prohibit the making or amendment of an Acquisition Proposal
privately, and that the Company may waive any such term in any existing
confidentiality agreements) (an " _Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement_ ");

Sub (through an electronic data site or otherwise), prior to or concurrently

information concerning the Company or its Subsidiaries that the Company
intends to provide to any Person given such access that was not previously
made available to Parent or Merger Sub, and (ii) engage or enter into,
continue or otherwise participate in any discussions or negotiations with any
Persons or groups of Persons and their

negotiations or any effort or attempt to make any Acquisition Proposals. The
Company agrees that it and its Subsidiaries will not enter into any
confidentiality agreement or other agreement with any Person subsequent to
the date hereof which prohibits the Company from providing any information to
Parent and Merger Sub in accordance with this _Section 6.2_.

(b) _No Solicitation or Negotiation_. Except as expressly permitted by this
_Section 6.2_ and except as may relate to any Excluded Party as set forth in
_Section 6.2(c)_ only for so long as they are Excluded Parties, the Company
and its Subsidiaries and their respective officers and directors shall, and
the Company shall cause its and its Subsidiaries other Representatives to,
(i) at 12:00 a.m. (New York City time) on the 31st calendar day after the

and terminate any solicitation, encouragement (including by way of providing
access to non-public information or the business, properties, assets or
personnel of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to any Person and its
Representatives, its Affiliates and its prospective equity and debt financing
sources), discussions or negotiations (or any other actions permitted by
_Section 6.2(a)_) with any Persons that may be ongoing with respect to any
inquiry, proposal or Acquisition Proposal, and as promptly as practicable
thereafter deliver a written notice to each such Person to the effect
that the Company is ending all discussions and negotiations with such Person
with respect to any inquiry, proposal or Acquisition Proposal, effective
immediately, which notice shall also request such Person to return or destroy
promptly all confidential information concerning the Company and its
Subsidiaries, and (ii) from the No-Shop Period Start Date until the earlier of
the Effective Time or the termination of this Agreement in accordance with
_Article VIII_ , not directly or indirectly (A) initiate, solicit, knowingly
facilitate or knowingly encourage (publicly or otherwise) (including by way of
providing access to non-public information or the business, properties, assets
or personnel of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to any Person and its

sources) any inquiries regarding, or the making, submission or announcement of
any proposal or offer that constitutes, or would reasonably be expected to
lead to, an Acquisition Proposal, (B) engage or enter into, continue or
otherwise participate in any discussions or negotiations with respect to, or
provide any non-public information or data concerning the Company or its
Subsidiaries or the business, properties, assets or personnel of the Company

be expected to lead to, any Acquisition Proposal or otherwise cooperate with
or assist or participate in, or knowingly facilitate such inquiries,
proposals, discussions or negotiations, (C) grant to any Person any waiver,
amendment or release under any standstill or confidentiality agreement or any
Takeover Statute, other than (if the Board determines that the failure to
take such action would be inconsistent with the Company directors fiduciary
duties under Applicable Law) a limited waiver, amendment or release under any
standstill agreement for the sole purpose of allowing any Person or group of
Persons to make an Acquisition Proposal or an offer that would reasonably be
expected to lead to an Acquisition Proposal or (D) otherwise knowingly
facilitate any such inquiries, proposals, discussion or negotiations or any
effort or attempt by any Person to make an Acquisition Proposal. Not later
than twenty-four (24) hours after the expiration of the Go-Shop Period, the
Company shall certify to Parent and Merger Sub the number and identity of any
Excluded Parties and, subject to the ability of the Company to make a
Recommendation Withdrawal pursuant to and in accordance with this _Section
6.2_, the Companys Board of Directors shall publicly expressly reaffirm the
Company Board Recommendation.

 



48 (c) _Conduct Following No-Shop Period Start Date_. Notwithstanding anything in
this Agreement to the contrary but subject to the last sentence of this
_Section 6.2(c)_, at any time following the No-Shop Period Start Date and
prior to the Acceptance Time, if the Company receives an Acquisition Proposal

breach of this _Section 6.2_ (i) the Company and its Representatives may
contact such Person or group of Persons solely to clarify the terms and
conditions thereof, (ii) the Company and its Representatives may provide non-
public information and data concerning the Company and the Company
Subsidiaries to such Person or group of Persons and their Representatives and
their prospective equity and debt financing sources if the Company first
receives from such Person an executed Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement;
provided that the Company shall promptly make available to Parent and Merger
Sub (through an electronic data site or otherwise), prior to or
concurrently with providing such information to any such Person(s), any non-
public information concerning the Company or its Subsidiaries that the Company
made available to any such Person or group of Persons and their
Representatives and their prospective equity and debt financing sources if
such information was not previously made available to Parent or Merger Sub,
and (iii) the Company and its Representatives may engage or participate in any
discussions or negotiations with such Person regarding such Acquisition
Proposal, if prior to taking any action described in clauses (ii) or (iii)
above, (x) such Person first executes an Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement
with the Company and the Company Board of Directors determines in good faith
(after consultation with its financial advisor and outside counsel) that (A)
the failure to take such action would be inconsistent with the Company
directors fiduciary duties under Applicable Law and (B) such Acquisition
Proposal either constitutes a Superior Proposal or would reasonably be
expected to result in a Superior Proposal, (y) the Company provides prompt
notice to Parent of each such determination by the Companys Board of
Directors and of its intent to provide such information or engage in such
negotiations or discussions and (z) such Acquisition Proposal did not result
from a material breach of this _Section 6.2_. For the avoidance of doubt,
notwithstanding the occurrence of the No-Shop Period Start Date, the Company
may continue to engage in the activities described in _Section 6.2(a)_ with
respect to any Excluded Parties, including with respect to any amended
proposal that is submitted by any Excluded Parties following the No-Shop
Period Start Date, and the restrictions in _Section 6.2(b)_ shall not apply
with respect thereto; provided that the provisions of _Section 6.2(e)_ and
_(g)_ shall apply. Following the No-Shop Period Start Date and until the

shall notify Parent promptly (and, in any event within twenty-four (24) hours)
of (x) any request for information, discussions or negotiations relating to
an Acquisition Proposal or (y) any Acquisition Proposal that is received by

(it being understood that any such fee letter may be redacted to omit the
numerical amounts provided therein)) and (iii) a written summary of
the material terms of any such Acquisition Proposal not made in writing. From
and after the No-Shop Period Start Date, the Company shall keep Parent and its
Representatives reasonably informed of any material changes in the status or
terms of any 

 



49  Acquisition Proposal (whether made before or after the No-Shop Period Start
Date, and whether solicited in accordance with this _Section 6.2_ or
unsolicited) on a current basis (and, in any event within twenty-four (24)
hours of any such material changes).

a merger, reorganization, consolidation, share exchange, business combination,
recapitalization, liquidation, dissolution or similar transaction involving
an acquisition of the Company, (B) the acquisition in any manner, directly or

securities) or assets (including capital stock of any Subsidiaries of the
Company) of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries representing twenty percent
(20%) or more of the consolidated assets of the Company (based on the fair
market value thereof, as determined in good faith by the Board of Directors)
or of the consolidated revenues, net income or operating cash flow of the
Company, (C) any tender offer or exchange offer that results in or, if
consummated, would result in any Person or Group of Persons, directly or
indirectly, beneficially owning twenty percent (20%) or more of the equity
securities (or securities convertible into twenty percent (20%) or more of
the equity securities) of the Company or (D) any combination of the
foregoing, in the case of each of clauses (A) through (D), other than the
Merger.

of its Representatives has received during the Go-Shop Period a written
Acquisition Proposal that the Board of Directors of the Company determines in

after consultation with its financial advisor and outside counsel, is (i)
reasonably likely to be, and reasonably capable of being, consummated in
accordance with its terms, and (ii) if consummated, would be more favorable to
the Companys stockholders from a financial point of view than the Offer, the

would be binding upon Parent and Merger Sub), taking into account and without

(i) (A) change, withhold, withdraw, qualify or modify (or resolve or publicly
propose to change, withhold, withdraw, qualify or modify), in a manner adverse
to Parent, the Company Board Recommendation, (B) fail to include the Company
Board Recommendation in the Schedule 14D-9 or the Proxy Statement, (C) adopt,
approve, authorize, declare advisable or recommend to propose to adopt,
approve, authorize or declare advisable (whether publicly or otherwise) any
Acquisition Proposal or (D) take formal action, make any recommendation or
public statement in connection with, or fail to recommend against, any
Acquisition Proposal subject to Regulation 14D under the Exchange Act in any
solicitation or recommendation statement made on Schedule 14D-9
relating thereto within ten (10) Business Days after the commencement of such
Acquisition Proposal (any such action, a " _Recommendation Withdrawal_ "); or

 

(ii) except if it concurrently terminates this Agreement pursuant to _Section
8.1(d)(ii)_ and immediately prior to or concurrently with such termination
pays to Parent or its designees in immediately available funds any fees
required to be paid pursuant to _Section 8.3_, approve or recommend, or
resolve or publicly propose to approve or recommend, or cause or permit the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries to enter into, any letter of intent,
memorandum of understanding, acquisition agreement, merger agreement or
similar definitive agreement relating to any Acquisition Proposal (other than
an Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement pursuant to _Section 6.2(a)_ or
_Section 6.2(c)_) (an " _Alternative Acquisition Agreement_ ").

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement, prior to
the Acceptance Time, but not after, so long as none of the Company, its
Subsidiaries or their Representatives have breached in any material respect
this _Section 6.2_, the Board of Directors of the Company may, if the Board
determines that the failure to take such action would be inconsistent with the
Company directors fiduciary duties under Applicable Law: (x) effect a
Recommendation Withdrawal in response to an Acquisition Proposal that the
Board of Directors of the Company determines in good faith (after consultation
with its financial advisor and outside counsel) is a Superior
Proposal (including any Superior Proposal made by an Excluded Party) made
after the date hereof (giving effect to all of the binding written
adjustments, if any, offered to Parent pursuant to _Section 6.2(g)_), (y)
subject to prior or concurrent payment of the Termination Fee, terminate this
Agreement under _Section 8.1(d)(ii)_ if the Board of Directors of the Company
determines in good faith (after consultation with its financial advisor and
outside counsel) that the Acquisition Proposal that is the subject of the
Alternative Acquisition Agreement is a Superior Proposal or (z) effect a
Recommendation Withdrawal in response to an Intervening Event. For purposes of
this Agreement, " _Intervening Event_ " means any event, fact, development

 



51  or occurrence that affects the business, assets or operations of the Company
that is unknown to, and is not reasonably foreseeable by, the Board of
Directors of the Company as of the date of this Agreement, that becomes known
to the Board of Directors of the Company after the date of this Agreement;
provided, however, that in no event shall the receipt, existence or terms of
an Acquisition Proposal or any matter relating thereto or consequence thereof
constitute an Intervening Event.

(f) _Certain Permitted Disclosure_. Nothing contained in this  _Section 6.2_
shall be deemed to prohibit the Company or the Board of Directors of the
Company from (i) complying with its disclosure obligations under United States
federal or state law with regard to an Acquisition Proposal, including taking
and disclosing to its shareholders a position contemplated by Rule 14d-9 and
Rule 14e-2(a) promulgated under the Exchange Act (or any similar communication
to shareholders) or (ii) making any "stop-look-and-listen" communication to
the shareholders of the Company pursuant to Rule 14d-9(f) promulgated under
the Exchange Act (or any similar communications to the shareholders of the
Company); provided that (x) this _Section 6.2(f)_ shall not permit the Board
of Directors of the Company to make a Recommendation Withdrawal or take any
other actions contemplated by this _Section 6.2_ except, in each case, to the
extent permitted by, and subject to the terms and conditions of,  _Section
6.2_, and (y) in any such disclosure or communication, the Company publicly
states that there has been no change in the Company Board Recommendation.

(g) _Notice_. The Company shall not be entitled to effect a Recommendation
Withdrawal with respect to a Superior Proposal or an Intervening Event or to
terminate this Agreement under  _Section 8.1(d)(ii)_ unless (i) the Company
has provided a written notice to Parent and Merger Sub at least three (3)
Business Days in advance (the " _Notice Period_ "), which notice in the case
of (A) a Superior Proposal (a " _Notice of Superior Proposal_ ") shall
specify that the Company intends to take such action and include copies of all
relevant documents relating to such Superior Proposal (including copies of the
then-current form of acquisition agreement, together with copies of any
commitment letters or similar material documents with respect to any financing
for such Superior Proposal), or if either the Superior Proposal or financing
terms were not made in writing, a description of the material terms and
conditions of the Superior Proposal or financing, as applicable, that is the
basis of such action (including the identity of the Person making such
proposal), or (B) an Intervening Event (a " _Notice of Intervening Event_ ")
shall describe in reasonable detail such Intervening Event; (ii) if requested
by Parent and Merger Sub, the Company shall, and shall direct its financial
advisor and outside counsel to, during the Notice Period, negotiate with
Parent and Merger Sub and their Representatives in good faith to make
amendments to the terms and conditions of this Agreement; (iii) following the
end of the Notice Period, the Company Board of Directors shall have determined
in good faith after consultation with its financial advisor and outside
counsel, taking into account any written and complete amendments to the terms
and conditions of this Agreement proposed by Parent and Merger Sub that, if
accepted by the Company, would be binding upon Parent and Merger Sub in
response to the Notice of Superior Proposal, the Notice of Intervening Event
or otherwise, that (1) the Superior Proposal giving rise to the Notice of
Superior Proposal continues to constitute a Superior Proposal or (2) such
changes would not change the determination of the Companys Board of Directors
of the need for a Recommendation Withdrawal in response to such Intervening
Event, as applicable. In the event of any material revisions to such Superior
Proposal or material changes related to such Intervening Event, the Company
shall be required to deliver a

 



52  new written notice to Parent and Merger Sub and to comply with the
requirements of this _Section 6.2(g)_ with respect to such new written
notice, except that the deadline for such new written notice shall be reduced
to two (2) Business Days.

Section 6.3 _Access to Information_. Upon reasonable advance notice, the
Company shall, and shall cause each of its Subsidiaries to, afford the
Representatives of Parent reasonable access during normal business hours to
its and its Subsidiaries properties, books, records, Contracts,
legal counsel, financial advisors, accountants, consultants and personnel,
and shall furnish, and shall cause to be furnished, as promptly as practicable
to Parent, all other information concerning the Company and its Subsidiaries
business, properties and personnel as Parent may reasonably request for
purposes of diligence, integration planning and facilitating the transfer of
the ownership of the Company; _provided_ , _however_ that (a) the Company may
(after consulting outside legal counsel) reasonably restrict the foregoing
access to the extent that any applicable Law, Governmental Entity or attorney-
client privilege concerns requires it or its Subsidiaries to restrict access
to any properties or information; (b) the Company may reasonably restrict the
foregoing access to the extent required by Contracts to which the Company or
its respective Subsidiaries is a party; and (c) the Company uses reasonable
efforts to seek consent to provide such information and access or otherwise
provides such information and access in redacted form. In conducting any
inspection of any properties of the Company and its respective Subsidiaries,
Parent and its Representatives shall not (i) interfere with the business
conducted at such property or (ii) damage any property or any portion thereof.
Prior to the Acceptance Time, Parent and its Representatives shall not have
the right to conduct environmental testing or sampling at any of
the facilities or properties of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries. All
information obtained pursuant to this _Section 6.3_ shall continue to be
governed by the Confidentiality Agreement which shall remain in full force and
effect in accordance with its terms.

Section 6.4 _Consents, Approvals and Filings_.

 

(a) Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement,
the parties shall, and shall cause their respective Subsidiaries to, use
reasonable best efforts (i) to cause the conditions set forth in _Annex B_ and
_Article VII_ to be satisfied as promptly as practicable, (ii) to take, or
cause to be taken, all actions necessary, proper or advisable to comply
promptly with all legal requirements which may be imposed on such party or its
Subsidiaries with respect to the Offer, the Merger and the other Transactions
and, subject to the conditions set forth in _Annex B_ and  _Article VII_
hereof, to consummate the Offer, the Merger and the other Transactions, as
promptly as practicable, and (iii) to obtain as promptly as practicable any
Consent of, or any exemption or waiver by, any Governmental Entity, including
any Consents under Antitrust Laws, and any other third-party Consent which is
required to be obtained by the parties or their respective Subsidiaries in
connection with the Offer, the Merger and the other Transactions, and to
comply with the terms and conditions of any such Consent. The parties shall
cooperate with the reasonable requests of each other in seeking to obtain as
promptly as practicable any such Consent. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary herein, the Company shall not be required prior to the Effective
Time to pay any consent or similar fee, "profit sharing" or other similar
payment or other consideration (including increased rent or other similar
payments or any amendments, supplements or other modifications to (or waivers
of) the existing terms of any Contract), or the provision of additional
security (including a guaranty) to obtain the Consent of any Person under any
Contract.

 



53 (b) Neither the Company nor Parent shall, and each of them shall cause its
Affiliates not to, after the date hereof directly or indirectly acquire,
purchase, lease or license (or agree to acquire, purchase, lease or license),
by merging with or into or consolidating with, or by purchasing a substantial
portion of the assets of or equity in, or by any other manner, any business
or any corporation, partnership, association or other business organization or
division or part thereof, or any securities or collection of assets, if doing
so would reasonably be expected to: (i) impose any material delay in the
obtaining of, or materially increase the risk of not obtaining, any Consent,
or approach of any Governmental Entity necessary to consummate the Offer, the
Merger and the other Transactions or the expiration or termination of any
applicable waiting period; (ii) materially increase the risk of any
Governmental Entity entering an Order prohibiting the consummation of the
Offer, the Merger and the other Transactions; (iii) materially increase the
risk of not being able to remove any such Order on appeal or otherwise or
(iv) prevent or materially impede or delay the consummation of the Offer, the
Merger and the other Transactions.

 

(c) In furtherance of the foregoing, the parties shall as promptly as
practicable following the date of this Agreement make all filings and
notifications with all Governmental Entities that may be or may become
reasonably necessary, proper or advisable under this Agreement and applicable
Law to consummate and make effective the Offer, the Merger and the other
Transactions, including: (i) not later than ten (10) Business Days following
the date of this Agreement, the Company and Parent each making an appropriate
filing of a notification and report form pursuant to the HSR Act with the
Federal Trade Commission (" _FTC_ ") and the Antitrust Division of the United
States Department of Justice (" _DOJ_ ") with respect to the Offer, the Merger
and the other Transactions and requesting early termination of the initial
waiting period under the HSR Act; (ii) the Company and Parent each making any
other filing that may be required under any other Antitrust Laws or by any
Antitrust Authority; and (iii) the Company and Parent making any other filing
that may be required under any applicable Law or by any Governmental Entity
with jurisdiction over enforcement of any such Law. Each of the Company and
Parent agrees to use reasonable best efforts to supply as promptly as
practicable any additional information and documentary material that may be
reasonably requested by a Governmental Entity pursuant to the HSR Act or other
applicable Law.

 

(d) The Company and Parent shall (i) furnish each other and, upon request, any
Governmental Entity, any information or documentation concerning themselves,
their Affiliates, directors, officers, securityholders and debt financing
sources, information or documentation concerning the Offer, the Merger and the
other Transactions and such other matters as may be requested and (ii) make
available their respective personnel and advisers to each other and, upon
request, any Governmental Entity, in connection with (A) the preparation of
any statement, filing, notice or application made by or on their behalf to
any Governmental Entity in connection with the Offer, the Merger or the other
Transactions or (B) any review or approval process.

(e) Subject to applicable Law relating to the sharing of information, each of
the Company and Parent shall promptly notify the other of any communication it
or any of its Affiliates receives from any Governmental Entity relating to
the matters that are the subject of

 



54  this Agreement, and prior to submitting any substantive written
communication, correspondence or filing by such party or any or its
Representatives, on the one hand, to any Governmental Entity, or members of
the staff of any Governmental Entity, on the other, subject to _Section 6.3_,
the submitting party shall permit the other party and its counsel a reasonable
opportunity to review in advance, and consider in good faith the views of the
other party provided in a timely manner, in connection with any such
communication. Subject to _Section 6.3_ and the terms and conditions of the
Confidentiality Agreement, the Company and Parent shall coordinate and
cooperate fully with each other in exchanging such information and providing
such assistance as the other party may reasonably request in connection with
the foregoing (including in seeking early termination of any applicable
waiting periods under the HSR Act). To the extent practicable under the
circumstances, none of the parties to this Agreement shall agree to
participate in any substantive meeting with any Governmental Entity in respect
of any filings, investigation (including any settlement of the
investigation), litigation, or other inquiry unless it consults with the other
party in advance and, where permitted, allows the other party to participate.
Neither party shall be required to comply with any of the foregoing provisions
of this  _Section 6.4(e)_ to the extent that such compliance would be
prohibited by applicable Law. The parties further covenant and agree not to
voluntarily extend any waiting period associated with any Consent of any
Governmental Entity or enter into any agreement with any Governmental Entity
not to consummate the Merger and the other Transactions, except with the prior
written consent of the other party hereto.

(f) Each of the Company and Parent may, as each deems advisable and necessary,
reasonably designate any competitively sensitive material provided to the
other under this _Section 6.4_ as " _Antitrust Counsel Only Material_." Such
materials and the information contained therein shall be given only to the
outside antitrust counsel of the recipient and will not be disclosed by such
outside counsel to employees, officers or directors of the recipient unless
express permission is obtained in advance from the source of the materials
(the Company or Parent, as the case may be) or its legal counsel.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this  _Section 6.4_, materials
provided to the other party or its outside counsel may be redacted (1) to
remove references concerning valuation, (2) as necessary to comply with
contractual arrangements, (3) as necessary to address reasonable attorney-
client or other privilege or confidentiality concerns and (4) to remove
references concerning pricing and other competitively sensitive terms from an
antitrust perspective in the Contracts of the Company, Parent and
their respective Subsidiaries.

(g) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, in no event shall Parent
or its Affiliates or the Company or its Affiliates be required to agree to
take or enter into any action required by any Governmental Entity which is not
conditioned upon the Closing.

Section 6.5 _Employee Matters_.

(a) Until the first anniversary of the Effective Time (the " _Benefits
Continuation Period_ "), Parent shall, and shall cause the Surviving
Corporation and its Affiliates to, provide, for those employees of the Company
and its Subsidiaries who continue as employees of the Surviving Corporation
or any of its Affiliates during all or a portion of the Benefits Continuation
Period (the " _Continuing Employees_ "), compensation (including base salary,
bonus and other incentive compensation opportunities) and employee benefits
(excluding severance) that in the

 



55  aggregate with respect to each Continuing Employee shall not be any less
favorable than the compensation and employee benefits provided by (i) in the
case of salaried Continuing Employees, Parent (or, in the event of any
assignment of rights under this Agreement to American Blue Ribbon Holdings,
LLC (" _ABRH_ ") pursuant to _Section 9.7_, the compensation and employee
benefits provided ABRH) to similarly situated employees of Parent and its
Subsidiaries (or, in the event of any assignment of rights under this
Agreement to ABRH pursuant to _Section 9.7_, similarly situated employees of
ABRH and its subsidiaries) and (ii) in the case of hourly Continuing
Employees, the Company or the applicable Subsidiary to such Continuing
Employee immediately prior to the Acceptance Time. Nothing herein shall be
deemed to be a guarantee of employment for any current or former employee of
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, or, other than as provided in any
applicable employment agreement or other Contract, to restrict the right of
Parent or the Surviving Corporation or any of its Affiliates to terminate the
employment of any such Continuing Employee.

(b) Parent shall, and shall cause the Surviving Corporation and its
Affiliates, to (i) waive any applicable pre-existing condition exclusions and
waiting periods with respect to participation and coverage requirements in any
replacement or successor welfare benefit plan of Parent or the Surviving
Corporation or any of its Affiliates that a Continuing Employee is eligible
to participate in following the Effective Time to the extent such exclusions
or waiting periods were inapplicable to, or had been satisfied by, such
Continuing Employee immediately prior to the Effective Time under the
analogous Company Benefit Plan in which such Continuing Employee participated,
(ii) provide each Continuing Employee with credit for any co-payments and
deductibles paid prior to the Effective Time (to the same extent such credit
was given under the analogous Company Benefit Plan prior to the Effective
Time) in satisfying any applicable deductible or out-of-pocket requirements
and (iii) recognize service prior to the Effective Time with the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries for purposes of eligibility to participate, vesting,
determination of level of benefits and benefits accrual to the same extent
such service was recognized by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries under
the analogous Company Benefit Plan in which such Continuing Employee
participated immediately prior to the Effective Time; _provided_ , _however_ ,
that the foregoing shall not apply to the extent it would result in any
duplication of benefits for the same period of service;  _provided_ ,
_further_ , that neither the Parent nor the Surviving Corporation nor any of
its Affiliates shall be obligated to provide credit for years of service for
benefit accrual purposes under any defined benefit pension plan maintained by
Parent or the Surviving Corporation or any of its Affiliates prior to the date
on which the Continuing Employee actually becomes a participant in such plan
(it being understood that Parent and the Surviving Corporation and its
Affiliates shall in all cases provide credit for years of service for benefit
accrual purposes in accordance with the terms and conditions of each such
defined benefit pension plan as in effect immediately prior to the Effective
Time).

 

(c) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement to the contrary,
Parent shall, and shall cause the Surviving Corporation and any of its
Affiliates to, provide certain Continuing Employees whose employment
terminates during the Benefits Continuation Period with retention benefits at
levels no less than and pursuant to the terms set forth in _Section 6.5(c)_
of the Company Disclosure Schedule.

(d) Nothing contained in this Agreement, whether express or implied, (i) shall
be treated as an amendment or other modification of any Company Benefit Plan,
(ii) subject to the

 



56  requirements of this _Section 6.5_, shall limit the right of Parent or the
Surviving Corporation or any of its Affiliates to amend, terminate or
otherwise modify any Company Benefit Plan following the Closing Date or (iii)
subject to the requirements of this _Section 6.5_, shall limit the right of
Parent or the Surviving Corporation or any of its Affiliates to terminate the
employment of any Continuing Employee following the Closing Date.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement, but
without limiting any existing rights of the Continuing Employees under any
Company Benefit Plans, no provision of this _Section 6.5_ shall be deemed to
create any third-party beneficiary rights.

Section 6.6 _Expenses_. Except as otherwise provided in _Section 8.3_,
whether or not the Merger is consummated, all Expenses incurred in connection
with this Agreement and the Transactions shall be paid by the party incurring
such Expenses. As used in this Agreement, " _Expenses_ " includes all out-of-
pocket expenses (including all fees and expenses of counsel, accountants,
investment bankers, experts and consultants to a party and its Affiliates)
incurred by a party or on its behalf in connection with or related to the
authorization, preparation, negotiation, execution and performance of this
Agreement and the Transactions.

Section 6.7 _Directors  and Officers Indemnification and Insurance_.

(a) From and after the Effective Time, Parent shall, and shall cause the
Company or the Surviving Corporation (as the case may be) to, to the fullest
extent permitted by Law (including to the fullest extent authorized or
permitted by any amendments to or replacements of the TBCA adopted after the
date of this Agreement that increase the extent to which a corporation may
indemnify its officers and directors), indemnify, defend and hold
harmless (and advance expenses from time to time as incurred to the fullest
extent permitted by Law, _provided_ the Person to whom expenses are advanced
complies with the provisions of Section 48-18-504 of the TBCA and provides
statements and reasonable documentation therefor) the present and former
directors and officers of the Company, any Person acting as director, officer,
trustee, fiduciary, employee or agent of another entity or enterprise
(including any Company Benefit Plan) at the request of the Company (each an "
_Indemnified Party_ ") from and against any and all actual, documented costs
or expenses (including reasonable attorneys fees, expenses and
disbursements), judgments, fines, losses, claims, damages, penalties,
liabilities and amounts paid in settlement in connection with any actual or
threatened claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation, whether civil,
criminal, administrative, regulatory or investigative, arising out
of, relating to or in connection with any circumstances, developments or
matters in existence, or acts or omissions occurring or alleged to occur prior
to or at the Effective Time, including the approval of this Agreement and the
Merger and the other Transactions or arising out of or pertaining to the
Merger and the other Transactions, whether asserted or claimed prior to, at or
after the Effective Time; _provided_ that the Person to whom expenses are
advanced provides written affirmation of the Indemnified Partys good faith
determination that any applicable standard of conduct required by the TBCA has
been met. Any determination required to be made with respect to whether an
Indemnified Partys conduct complies with the standards set forth under
applicable Law, the Company Charter, the Company Bylaws or a written Contract
between an Indemnified Party and the Company or one of its Subsidiaries, as
the case may be, shall be made by independent special legal counsel selected
by the Board of Directors of the Surviving Corporation or a committee thereof
in the manner prescribed by Section 48-18-506 of the TBCA, the fees of which
counsel shall be paid by the Surviving Corporation.

 



57 (b) An Indemnified Party shall notify the Surviving Corporation in writing
promptly upon learning of any claim, action, suit, proceeding, investigation
or other matter in respect of which such indemnification may be sought. The
Surviving Corporation shall have the right, but not the obligation, to assume
and control the defense of any act or omission covered under this _Section
6.7_ (each, a " _Claim_ ") with counsel selected by the Surviving Corporation,
which counsel shall be reasonably acceptable to the applicable Indemnified
Party; _provided_ ,  _however_ , that such Indemnified Party shall be
permitted to participate in the defense of such Claim at his or her own
expense; and _provided_ , _further_ , that if the Surviving Corporation
assumes the defense then the Surviving Corporation shall use its reasonable
best efforts to conduct a vigorous defense of such matter. Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary in this Agreement, neither Parent nor the Surviving
Corporation shall, and Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation not to,
settle or compromise or consent to the entry of any judgment or otherwise seek
termination with respect to any claim, action, suit, proceeding or
investigation for which indemnification may be sought under this  _Section
6.7_ unless such settlement, compromise, consent or termination includes an
unconditional release of all Indemnified Parties from all liability arising
out of such claim, action, suit proceeding or investigation, and does
not include an admission of fault or wrongdoing by any Indemnified Party,
without the prior written consent of the Indemnified Party.

(c) Subject to the following sentence, the Company or the Surviving
Corporation (or any successor), as the case may be, shall, and Parent shall
cause the Company or the Surviving Corporation (or any successor), as the
case may be, to purchase, at no expense to the beneficiaries, a six (6) year
extended reporting period endorsement with respect to directors and officers
liability insurance and fiduciary liability insurance having terms and
conditions at least as favorable to the Indemnified Parties as the Companys
currently existing directors and officers liability insurance and fiduciary
liability insurance (a " _Reporting Tail Endorsement_ ") and maintain this
endorsement in full force and effect for its full term. To the extent
purchased after the date of this Agreement and prior to the Effective Time,
such insurance policies shall be placed through such broker(s) and with such
insurance carriers as may be specified by Parent and as are reasonably
acceptable to the Company; _provided_ that such insurance carrier has at least
an "A" rating by A.M. Best with respect to directors and officers liability
insurance and fiduciary liability insurance. Notwithstanding the first
sentence of this _Section 6.7(c)_, but subject to the second and last
sentence of this _Section 6.7(b)_, the Company shall be permitted at its
sole and exclusive option to purchase a Reporting Tail Endorsement prior to
the Effective Time. Notwithstanding any of the foregoing, (i) in no event
shall Parent or the Surviving Corporation be required to (or the Company
be able to) expend for such policy an aggregate amount in excess of 300% of
the annual premium currently payable by the Company, it being understood that
if the premiums payable for such insurance coverage exceeds such amount,
Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall be obligated to (or the Company
may only) obtain a policy with the greatest coverage available for a cost
equal to such amount.

(d) Following the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall, and Parent
shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, maintain in effect the provisions in
the Company Charter and the Company Bylaws as of the date of this Agreement
providing for indemnification, advancement and reimbursement of expenses and
exculpation of Indemnified Parties, as applicable, with respect to the facts
or circumstances occurring at or prior to the Effective Time, to the fullest
extent permitted from time to time under applicable Law, which provisions
shall not be amended in a manner that would adversely affect the rights
thereunder of the Indemnified Parties, except as required by applicable Law.

 



58 (e) If Parent or the Surviving Corporation or any of their respective
successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any other Person
and is not the continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such
consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers all or substantially all of its
properties and assets to any Person, then, and in each such case, Parent
shall cause proper provisions to be made prior to the consummation of any
transaction of the type described in clause (i) or (ii) of this sentence so
that the successors and assigns of Parent or the Surviving Corporation, as
the case may be, shall assume all of the obligations set forth in this
_Section 6.7_.

(f) From and after the Effective Time, Parent and the Surviving Corporation
shall not, directly or indirectly, amend, modify, limit or terminate the
advancement and reimbursement of expenses, exculpation, indemnification
provisions of the agreements listed in  _Section 6.7(f)_ of the Company
Disclosure Schedule between the Company and any of the Indemnified Parties, or
any such provisions contained in the Surviving Corporation charter or bylaws.

 

(g) This _Section 6.7_ is intended for the irrevocable benefit of, and to
grant third-party rights to, the Indemnified Parties and shall be binding on
all successors and assigns of Parent and the Surviving Corporation. The
obligations of Parent under this _Section 6.7_ shall not be terminated or
modified in such a manner as to adversely affect any Indemnified Party unless
(i) such termination or modification is required by applicable Law or (ii) the
affected Indemnified Party shall have consented in writing to such termination
or modification. It is expressly agreed that each Indemnified Party shall be
a third-party beneficiary of this _Section 6.7_, and entitled to enforce the
covenants contained in this _Section 6.7_. If any Indemnified Party makes any
claim for indemnification or advancement of expenses under this  _Section
6.7_ that is denied by Parent and/or the Surviving Corporation, and a court of
competent jurisdiction determines that the Indemnified Party is entitled to
such indemnification, then Parent or the Surviving Corporation shall pay such
Indemnified Partys costs and expenses, including legal fees and expenses,
incurred in connection with pursuing such claim against Parent and/or the
Surviving Corporation. The rights of the Indemnified Parties under this 
_Section 6.7_ shall be in addition to, and not in substitution for, any
rights such Indemnified Parties may have under the Company Charter and the
Company Bylaws, the certificate of incorporation and bylaws (or comparable
organizational documents) of any of the Companys Subsidiaries or the charter
or bylaws of the Surviving Corporation or under any applicable Contracts,
insurance policies or Laws and Parent shall, and shall cause the Surviving
Corporation to, honor and perform under all indemnification agreements
entered into by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries.

(h) Nothing in this Agreement is intended to, shall be construed to or shall
release, waive or impair any rights to directors and officers insurance
claims under any policy that is or has been in existence with respect to the
Company or any of its respective Subsidiaries for any of their respective
directors, officers or other employees, it being understood and agreed that
the indemnification provided for in this _Section 6.7_ is not prior to or in
substitution for any such claims under such policies.

 



59 Section 6.8 _Public Announcements_. The initial press release concerning
this Agreement and the Transactions shall be a joint press release approved
in advance by the Company and Parent. Following such initial press release and
prior to the Effective Time, Parent and the Company shall consult with each
other before issuing, and give each other the opportunity to review and
comment upon, any press release or other public statements with respect to the
Merger and the other Transactions and shall not issue any such press release
or make any such public statement prior to such consultation, except as such
party may reasonably conclude may be required by applicable Law, court process
or by obligations pursuant to any listing agreement with any national
securities exchange or national securities quotation system; provided,
however, that the restrictions set forth in this _Section 6.8_ shall not
apply to any release or public statement (a) made or proposed to be made by
the Company in accordance with _Section 6.2_ or (b) in connection with any
dispute between the parties regarding this Agreement, the Merger or the other
Transactions.

 

Section 6.9 _Notification_. The Company shall promptly notify Parent, and
Parent shall promptly notify the Company, of (a) any notice or other
communication received by such party from any Governmental Entity in
connection with the Merger and the other Transactions or from any Person
alleging that the consent of such Person is or may be required in
connection with the Merger and the other Transactions, if the subject matter
of such communication or the failure of such party to obtain such consent
would reasonably be expected to have a Company Material Adverse Effect or a
Parent Material Adverse Effect, (b) any matter that would reasonably be
expected to lead to the failure to satisfy any of the conditions to Closing in
_Annex B_ or _Article VII_ or any material breach of any representation,
warranty, covenant or agreement contained in this Agreement and (c) any
action, suits, claims, investigations or proceedings commenced or, to such

correct in all respects (without giving effect to any materiality or Company
Material Adverse Effect qualifier therein), as of the date of this Agreement

not reasonably be expected to have, a Company Material Adverse Effect; (ii)
each of the Fundamental Representations shall be true and correct in all
material respects, as of the date of this Agreement and as of the Acceptance
Time as though made on or as of such date (or, in the case of representations
and warranties that address matters only as of a particular date, as of such
date); (iii) each of the Capitalization Representations shall be true and

pursuant to this Agreement of more than $625,000 in the aggregate), as of the
date of this Agreement and as of the Acceptance Time as though made on or as

party has under the Agreement), and, except for the Minimum Condition, may
be waived by Parent or Merger Sub in whole or in part at any time and from
time to time, subject to the terms of the Agreement and applicable Law. The
failure by Parent or Merger Sub at any time to exercise any of the foregoing
rights shall not be deemed a waiver of any such right, the waiver of such
right with respect to any particular facts or circumstances shall not be
deemed a waiver with respect to any other facts and circumstances, and each
such right shall be deemed an ongoing right which may be asserted at any time
and from time to time.

The capitalized terms used in this _Annex B_ shall have the meanings set
forth in the Agreement to which it is annexed, except that the term
