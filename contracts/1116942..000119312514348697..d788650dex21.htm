ARTICLE III

EFFECTS OF THE MERGER

Section 3.01. _Conversion of Securities_. At and as of the Effective
Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of Parent,
Merger Sub, the Company or the Company Stockholders (other than any requisite
approval of the principal terms of the Merger by the Company Stockholders in
accordance with the DGCL): 

(a) Each Company Share held in treasury and each Company Share that is
owned, directly or indirectly, by a wholly owned Subsidiary of the Company,
Parent or Merger Sub immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be
cancelled and shall cease to exist, without any conversion thereof and no
payment or distribution shall be made with respect thereto.

 



14 (b) Each Company Share issued and outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time (other than Dissenting Shares and Company Shares to be
cancelled in accordance with _Section 3.01(a))_ shall (i) be converted
automatically into the right to receive the Merger Consideration, payable to
the holder thereof, in accordance with _Section 3.02_, (ii) no longer be
outstanding, (iii) automatically be cancelled and (iv) cease to exist. Each
holder of any such converted and cancelled Company Share shall cease to have
any rights with respect thereto, except the right to receive the Merger
Consideration, without interest. The Company Shares that are to be so
converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration are referred to
herein as the " _Merger Shares_."

(c) Each issued and outstanding share of common stock, par value $0.01
per share, of Merger Sub shall be converted into and become one validly
issued, fully paid and nonassessable share of common stock, par value $0.01
per share, of the Surviving Corporation.

 

Section 3.02. _Payment of Merger Consideration; Surrender of Company
Shares; Stock Transfer Books_.

 

(a) Prior to the Effective Time, Parent or Merger Sub shall appoint as
exchange agent a bank or trust company reasonably satisfactory to the Company
(the " _Exchange Agent_ ") for the purpose of paying the Merger Consideration
to Company Stockholders. Prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall deposit
with the Exchange Agent, for the benefit of the holders of Merger Shares,
shares of Parent Common Stock (which shall be in non-certificated book entry
form) and an amount of cash sufficient to pay the aggregate Merger
Consideration required to be issued and paid in accordance with this
Agreement. Parent shall promptly deposit with the Exchange Agent from time to
time as needed any cash in lieu of fractional shares of Parent Common Stock to
be paid in consideration thereof pursuant to _Section 3.02(j)_ and any
dividends or other distributions which a holder of Company Shares has the
right to receive pursuant to _Section 3.02(i)_. All shares representing Parent
Common Stock and cash deposited with the Exchange Agent are hereinafter
referred to as the " _Exchange Fund_." Parent will instruct the Exchange
Agent to pay the Merger Consideration out of the Exchange Fund in accordance
with the terms of this Agreement, and the Exchange Fund will not be used for
any purpose other than the payment of the Merger Consideration and dividends
and other distributions in accordance with this _ARTICLE III_. Notwithstanding
the foregoing, any consideration payable in respect of Company Stock Options,
Company Restricted Stock and/or Company Performance Share Units will not be
deposited with the Exchange Agent but will instead be paid in accordance with
_Section 3.03_.

 

(b) The cash portion of the Exchange Fund shall be invested by the
Exchange Agent as directed by Parent; provided that (i) such investments will
be in obligations of, or guaranteed by, the United States of America or rated
A-1 or P-1 or better by Moodys Investors Service, Inc. or Standard and Poors
Corporation, respectively, and (ii) no gain or loss thereon shall affect the
amounts payable to the holders of Merger Shares following completion of the
Merger pursuant to this _ARTICLE III_ and Parent shall take all actions
necessary to ensure that the Exchange Fund includes at all times cash
sufficient to satisfy Parents obligation under this _ARTICLE III_. Subject to
Parents obligations pursuant to this _ARTICLE III_, any and all interest and
other income earned on the Exchange Fund shall promptly be paid to Parent or
an Affiliate of Parent as directed by Parent.

 

(c) As promptly as practicable after the Effective Time, but in no
event more than three Business Day following the Effective Time, Parent and
the Surviving Corporation shall cause the Exchange Agent to mail to each
holder of record of Merger Shares (other than The Depository Trust Company or
its nominee (" _DTC_ ")) as of the Effective Time (and, to the extent
commercially practicable, Parent will, or will cause the Exchange Agent to,
make available for collection by hand, during customary business hours
commencing immediately after the Effective Time, if so elected by any such
holder) (i) a letter of transmittal (each such letter, a " _Letter of
Transmittal_ ") (which shall be in customary form approved by the Company) and
(ii) instructions thereto for use in effecting the surrender of certificates
representing Merger Shares (the " _Company Share Certificates_ ") and
uncertificated Merger Shares held of record in book entry form ("
_Uncertificated Company Shares_ ") in exchange for the Merger Consideration,
including cash in lieu of any fractional shares payable pursuant to _Section
3.02(j)_.

 



15 (d) Upon surrender to the Exchange Agent of (i) Company Share
Certificates or (ii) Uncertificated Company Shares in compliance with the
procedures set forth in the Letter of Transmittal and instructions thereto,
together with a Letter of Transmittal duly completed and validly executed in
accordance with the instructions thereto, and such other documents as may be
required pursuant to such instructions, the holder of such Company Share
Certificates or Uncertificated Company Shares shall be entitled to receive as
promptly as reasonably practicable in exchange therefor, (A) the number of
shares of Parent Common Stock (which shall be in non-certificated book entry
form unless a physical certificate is specifically requested) representing, in
the aggregate, the whole number of shares of Parent Common Stock that such
holder has the right to receive pursuant to this _ARTICLE III_ and (B) the
amount of cash such holder has the right to receive pursuant to this _ARTICLE
III_. DTC, upon surrender of the Merger Shares held of record by it in
accordance with the customary surrender procedures of DTC and the Exchange
Agent, shall be entitled to receive as promptly as practicable in exchange for
each surrendered Merger Share, (i) the number of shares of Parent Common
Stock representing, in the aggregate, the whole number of shares of Parent
Common Stock that DTC has the right to receive pursuant to this _ARTICLE III_
and (ii) the amount of cash DTC has the right to receive pursuant to this
_ARTICLE III_. Each Merger Share surrendered pursuant to this _Section
3.02(d)_ will be cancelled. No interest shall be paid or will accrue on any
cash payable to holders of Company Share Certificates or Uncertificated
Company Shares, cash in lieu of fractional shares, or any unpaid dividends and
distributions payable to holders of Company Share Certificates or
Uncertificated Company Shares. No Person beneficially owning Company Shares
through DTC will be required to deliver a Letter of Transmittal to receive
the Merger Consideration. Any such Person will receive its Merger
Consideration in accordance with the customary payment procedures of DTC
following the Effective Time.

 

(e) In the event of a transfer of ownership of Merger Shares that is
not registered in the transfer records of the Company, payment of the Merger
Consideration in respect of the applicable Merger Shares may be made to a
Person other than the Person in whose name the Company Share Certificates or
the Uncertificated Company Shares so surrendered are registered if such
Company Share Certificates shall be properly endorsed or otherwise be in
proper form for transfer or such Uncertificated Company Shares shall be
properly documented for transfer and the Person requesting such payment shall
pay any transfer Tax or other Taxes required by reason of the payment of the
Merger Consideration in respect thereof or establish to the reasonable
satisfaction of the Surviving Corporation that such Tax has been paid or is
not applicable. Until surrendered as contemplated by this _Section 3.02_,
each Company Share Certificate or Uncertificated Company Share shall be deemed
at all times after the Effective Time to represent only the right to receive
upon such surrender the Merger Consideration.

(f) If any Company Share Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or
destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the Person claiming
such Company Share Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if
required by the Surviving Corporation, the posting by such Person of a bond,
in such reasonable amount as the Surviving Corporation may direct, as
indemnity against any claim that may be made against it with respect to such
Company Share Certificate, the Exchange Agent shall pay in respect of Merger
Shares to which such lost, stolen or destroyed Company Share Certificate
relates the Merger Consideration to which the holder thereof is entitled.

 

(g) At the Effective Time, the stock transfer books of the Company
shall be closed and there shall be no further registration of transfers of
Merger Shares thereafter on the records of the Company. From and after the
Effective Time, the holders of Company Share Certificates or Uncertificated
Company Shares shall cease to have any rights with respect to such shares,
except as otherwise provided in this Agreement, the certificate of
incorporation of the Surviving Corporation or by applicable Law.

 

(h) Any portion of the Exchange Fund that remains undistributed to the
holders of Merger Shares for one year after the Effective Time shall be
delivered to the Surviving Corporation, upon demand, and any holders of Merger
Shares who have not theretofore complied with this _ARTICLE III_ shall
thereafter look only to the Surviving Corporation for, and the Surviving
Corporation shall remain liable for, payment of their

 



16  claim for the Merger Consideration (and Parent shall take all actions
necessary to ensure that the Surviving Corporation has or has access to
sufficient funds and shares of Parent Common Stock to make such payments).
Any portion of the Exchange Fund remaining unclaimed by holders of Merger
Shares as of a date which is immediately prior to such time as such amounts
would otherwise escheat to or become property of any Governmental
Authority shall, to the extent permitted by applicable Law, become the
property of the Surviving Corporation free and clear of any claims or interest
of any Person previously entitled thereto. None of Parent, the Exchange Agent
or the Surviving Corporation shall be liable to any holder of Merger Shares
for any such shares (or dividends or distributions with respect thereto) or
cash delivered to a public official pursuant to any abandoned property,
escheat or similar Law.

 

(i) No dividends or other distributions with respect to shares of
Parent Common Stock issued in the Merger shall be paid to the holder of any
unsurrendered Company Shares until such Company Shares are surrendered as
provided in this _Section 3.02_. Following such surrender, subject to the
effect of escheat, Tax or other applicable Law, there shall be paid, without
interest, to the record holder of the shares of Parent Common Stock, if any,
issued in exchange therefor (i) at the time of such surrender, all dividends
and other distributions payable in respect of any such shares of Parent
Common Stock with a record date after the Effective Time and a payment date on
or prior to the date of such surrender and not previously paid, and (ii) at
the appropriate payment date, the dividends or other distributions payable
with respect to such shares of Parent Common Stock with a record date after
the Effective Time but with a payment date subsequent to such surrender. For
purposes of dividends or other distributions in respect of shares of Parent
Common Stock, all shares of Parent Common Stock to be issued pursuant to the
Merger shall be entitled to dividends pursuant to the immediately preceding
sentence as if issued and outstanding as of the Effective Time.

 

(j) No certificates or scrip representing fractional shares of Parent
Common Stock shall be issued upon the surrender for exchange of Company
Shares. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, each holder of
Merger Shares who would otherwise have been entitled to receive a fraction of
a share of Parent Common Stock (after taking into account all Company Shares
(or affidavits of loss in lieu thereof) surrendered by such holder) shall be
entitled to receive, from the Exchange Agent in accordance with the provisions
of this _Section 3.02(j)_, in lieu of such fractional shares, cash in the
amount equal to such fractional amount multiplied by the Parent Common Stock
Price.

 

Section 3.03. _Treatment of Stock Options, Restricted Stock and Company
Performance Share Units_. As soon as reasonably practicable following the
date of this Agreement, and in any event prior to the Effective Time, the
Company Board (or, if appropriate, any committee administering any Company
Equity Plan) will adopt resolutions, and the Company will take all other
actions as may be necessary or required in accordance with applicable Law and
each Company Equity Plan (including, the award agreements in respect of awards
granted thereunder) to give effect to this  _Section 3.03_, to provide that:

(a) Each Company Stock Option that is outstanding immediately prior to
the Effective Time (whether or not then vested or exercisable) shall,
immediately prior to the Effective Time, automatically and without any action
on the part of any holder of any Company Stock Option, vest in its entirety,
be cancelled and, in exchange therefor, converted into the right of each
holder of such Company Stock Option to receive from the Surviving Corporation:

 

(i) an amount in cash in respect thereof, if any, equal to the product
obtained by multiplying (A) the Cash Percentage by (B) the excess, if any, of
the Deemed Value of Merger Consideration over the per share exercise price of
such Company Stock Option by (C) the number of Company Shares subject to such
Company Stock Option; and

(ii) a number, rounded down to the nearest whole number, of shares of
Parent Common Stock in respect thereof, if any, equal to the quotient of (A)
the product obtained by multiplying (1) the Stock Percentage by (2) the
excess, if any, of the Deemed Value of Merger Consideration over the per
share 

 



17  exercise price of such Company Stock Option by (3) the number of Company
Shares subject to such Company Stock Option, divided by (B) the Parent Common
Stock Price, together with cash in the amount equal to (1) the fractional
amount of any shares that would, absent such rounding down, be issuable
pursuant to this _Section 3.03(a)_ (after taking into account all Company
Stock Options held by such holder) multiplied by (2) the Parent Common Stock
Price. Each Company Share issued upon exercise of a Company Stock Option that
is properly exercised prior to the Closing shall be deemed to be an
outstanding Merger Share for purposes of _Section 3.01_. 

(b) Each share of Company Restricted Stock that is outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall, immediately prior to the
Effective Time, automatically and without any action on the part of the holder
thereof, fully vest and the restrictions with respect thereto shall lapse, and
shall be treated as an outstanding Merger Share for purposes of _Section
3.01_.

(c) Each Company restricted stock unit that is subject to vesting
based on the achievement of performance conditions (" _Company Performance
Share Unit_ ") that is outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time
shall, immediately prior to the Effective Time, vest based on the greater of:
(i) 100% of the target payout and (ii) the payout that would result under the
Company Performance Share Unit based on the Companys actual performance
thereunder through the trading day immediately preceding the Closing Date, as
provided in the award agreements for such Company Performance Share Units (
_provided_ , _however_ , that the "Leveraged Performance Shares" listed on
_Section 4.04(c)_ of the Company Disclosure Schedule will vest based upon
the greater of (i) the closing price per share of the Company Shares on NASDAQ
on the trading day immediately preceding the Closing Date and (ii) the target
share price as provided in the award agreements for such Leveraged
Performance Shares), and each Company Share deemed to be issued in settlement
thereof shall be deemed to be an outstanding Merger Share for purposes of
_Section 3.01_.

 

(d) The cash consideration payable in respect of Company Stock Options,
Company Restricted Stock, and Company Performance Share Units shall be paid
through the payroll department of the Surviving Corporation as promptly as
reasonably practicable after the Effective Time in conjunction with the
Surviving Corporations regular payroll process. The Parent Common Stock
payable in respect of Company Stock Options, Company Restricted Stock, and
Company Share Units shall be paid by Parent as promptly as reasonably
practicable after the Effective Time.

 

(e) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall deliver to the
holders of the Company Stock Options, Company Restricted Stock and Company
Performance Share Units notices, in form and substance reasonably acceptable
to Parent, setting forth such holders rights pursuant to this Agreement.

 

(f) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall take all actions
necessary to terminate all of its Company Equity Plans, such termination to
be effective at the Effective Time.

 

(g) In connection with the termination of the Company Equity Plans,
following the Effective Time, no holder of Company Stock Options, Company
Restricted Stock and/or Company Performance Share Units, or any other
participant in or beneficiary of the Company Equity Plans, will have any right
to acquire or receive any equity securities of Parent, Surviving Corporation
or any Subsidiary thereof or any consideration in respect thereof other than
as expressly contemplated pursuant to this _Section 3.03_.

 

Section 3.04. _Dissenting Shares_.

 

(a) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, Company
Shares that are outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time and that
are held by any Company Stockholder who shall have neither voted in favor of
the Merger nor consented thereto in writing and who shall have demanded
properly in writing appraisal for such Company Shares in accordance with
Section 262 of the DGCL (collectively, the " _Dissenting Shares_ ") shall not
be converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration as provided
in 

 



18   _Section 3.01(b)_, but rather, the holders of Dissenting Shares shall be
entitled only to payment of the appraised value of such Dissenting Shares in
accordance with the provisions of Section 262 of the DGCL (and, at the
Effective Time, such Dissenting Shares shall no longer be outstanding and
shall automatically be cancelled and shall cease to exist, and such holders
shall cease to have any right with respect thereto, except the right to
receive the appraised value of such Dissenting Shares in accordance with the
provisions of Section 262 of the DGCL); _provided_ _,_ _however_ , that if any
such holder shall fail to perfect or otherwise shall waive, withdraw or lose
the right to appraisal under the provisions of Section 262 of the DGCL, then
the right of such holder to be paid the appraised value of such holders
Dissenting Shares shall cease and such Dissenting Shares shall be deemed to
have been converted as of the Effective Time into, and to have become
exchangeable solely for, the right to receive the Merger Consideration,
without interest, as provided in _Section 3.01(b)_.

 

(b) The Company shall notify Parent as promptly as reasonably
practicable of any demands received by the Company for appraisal of any
Company Shares, withdrawals thereof and any other instruments delivered to the
Company pursuant to Section 262 of the DGCL, and Parent shall have the right
to participate in all negotiations and proceedings with respect to such
demands. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall not, without the prior
written consent of Parent, voluntarily make any payment with respect to, or
settle or offer to settle, any such demands, or agree to do any of the
foregoing. Any portion of the Merger Consideration made available to the
Exchange Agent pursuant to _Section 3.02(a)_ to pay for Dissenting Shares
shall be returned to Parent upon demand.

 

Section 3.05. _Withholding Rights_. Notwithstanding anything in this
Agreement to the contrary, the Company, the Surviving Corporation, Parent,
Merger Sub and the Exchange Agent, as applicable, shall be entitled to deduct
and withhold from the Merger Consideration and any other payment otherwise
payable pursuant to this Agreement to any holder of Company Shares, Company
Stock Options, Company Restricted Stock or Company Performance Share Units, as
applicable, such amounts as it is required to deduct and withhold with respect
to the making of such payment under the Code or any provision of state, local
or foreign Tax Law. Any applicable Tax withholdings with respect to the
consideration payable to a holder of Company Stock Options, Company Restricted
Stock or Company Performance Share Units, as applicable, pursuant to 
_Section 3.03_ shall be withheld as follows: (a) an amount equal to the total
applicable Tax withholding multiplied by the Cash Percentage shall be withheld
from the cash consideration payable in respect of such holders Company Stock
Options, Company Restricted Stock, or Company Performance Share Units, as
applicable, and (b) the remaining amount of applicable Tax withholding shall
reduce the shares of Parent Common Stock payable in respect of such
holders Company Stock Options, Company Restricted Stock, or Company
Performance Share Units, as applicable. To the extent that amounts are so
withheld or paid over to or deposited with the applicable Tax authority, such
amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been
paid to the holder of the Company Shares, Company Stock Options, Company
Restricted Stock or Company Performance Share Units, as applicable, in respect
of which such deduction and withholding was made by the Company, the
Surviving Corporation, Parent, Merger Sub or the Exchange Agent, as
applicable.

 

Section 3.06. _Adjustments to Prevent Dilution_. Notwithstanding any
provision of this  _ARTICLE III_ to the contrary, if between the date of
this Agreement and the Effective Time the outstanding shares of Parent Common
Stock or Company Shares shall have been changed into a different number of
shares or a different class by reason of the occurrence or record date of any
stock dividend, subdivision, reclassification, split, combination, exchange of
shares or similar transaction, the Merger Consideration, the Per Share Cash
Consideration and the Per Share Stock Consideration and any other similarly
dependent item, as the case may be, shall be appropriately adjusted to reflect
fully the effect of such stock dividend, subdivision, reclassification, split,
combination, exchange of shares or similar transaction and to provide the
holders of Company Shares the same economic effect as contemplated by this
Agreement prior to such event; _provided_ , _however_ , that nothing in this
_Section 3.06_ shall be construed as permitting the Company to take any
action or enter into any transaction otherwise prohibited by this Agreement.

 



19 ARTICLE IV

 

REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF THE COMPANY

 

Except (a) as set forth in the Company Disclosure Schedule or (b) as set forth
in the Company SEC Reports filed from and after January 1, 2014 and prior to
the date of this Agreement (excluding all disclosures in any " _Risk Factors_
" section and any disclosures included in any such Company SEC Reports that
are forward looking in nature), but only to the extent such disclosure is
reasonably apparent from a reading of such Company SEC Reports that such
disclosure relates to such Section of _ARTICLE IV_ below, the Company hereby
represents and warrants to Parent and Merger Sub as follows: 

Section 4.01. _Organization and Qualification_. The Company is a
corporation duly organized, validly existing and in good standing under the

authority to own, operate and lease its properties and assets and carry on its
business as now conducted. The Company is duly qualified or licensed to do
business as a foreign corporation and is, to the extent applicable, in good
standing under the Laws of any other jurisdiction in which the character of
the properties owned, leased or operated by it therein or in which the
conduct or nature of its business makes such qualification or licensing
necessary, except where the failure to be so qualified, licensed or in good
standing has not had and would not reasonably be expected to have,
individually or in the aggregate, a Company Material Adverse Effect.

Section 4.02. _Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws_. The Company
has delivered to Parent copies of the Company Certificate and Company Bylaws,
and the copies of such documents are complete and correct and contain all
amendments and supplements thereto as in effect on the date of this

provisions.

 

Section 4.03. _Company Subsidiaries_.

 

(a) Each of the Companys Subsidiaries, together with the jurisdiction
of organization or formation of each such Subsidiary, is set forth in

of the Companys Subsidiaries is a corporation, partnership, limited liability
company, trust or other organization that is duly incorporated or organized,
validly existing and, to the extent applicable, in good standing under the
Laws of the jurisdiction of its incorporation or organization. Each of the
Companys Subsidiaries has the requisite corporate, limited partnership,

or licensed to do business and is in good standing (to the extent such
concept is applicable) in each jurisdiction where the character of the
properties owned, leased or operated by it or the conduct or nature of its
business makes such qualification or licensing necessary, except for
jurisdictions in which the failure to be so qualified, licensed or in good
standing has not had and would not reasonably be expected to have,
individually or in the aggregate, a Company Material Adverse Effect. 

(b) The Company is, directly or indirectly, the record and beneficial
owner of all of the outstanding shares of capital stock or other equity
interests of each of its Subsidiaries. All of such shares and other equity
interests so owned by the Company are validly issued, fully paid and
nonassessable and are owned by it free and clear of any Liens or limitations
on voting rights, are free of preemptive rights and were issued in compliance
with applicable Law. There are no subscriptions, options, warrants, calls,
rights, convertible securities or other agreements or commitments of any
character relating to the issuance, transfer, sales, delivery, voting or
redemption (including any rights of conversion or exchange under any
outstanding security or other instrument) for any of the capital stock or
other equity interests of, or other ownership interests in, any Subsidiary of
the Company. There are no agreements requiring the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries to make contributions to the capital of, or lend or advance funds
to, any Subsidiary of the Company or any other Person.

 



20 Section 4.04. _Capitalization_.

 

(a) The authorized capital stock of the Company consists of 100,000,000
Company Shares and 25,000,000 shares of preferred stock, par value $0.01 per

they are issuable, duly authorized, validly issued, fully paid and
nonassessable and free of preemptive rights.

 

(b) Except as set forth in _Section 4.04(a)_ and for any changes since
the close of business on the Capitalization Date resulting from the exercise
of Company Stock Options outstanding on such date, or the vesting of Company
Performance Share Units outstanding on such date, or actions taken after such

of capital stock of, or other voting securities or ownership interests in, the

the Company and its Subsidiaries taken as a whole, or relating to the
revocation or modification of any Permit that is material to the Company and

Merger Sub is duly qualified or licensed to do business as a foreign
corporation and is, to the extent applicable, in good standing under the Laws
of any other jurisdiction in which the character of the properties owned,
leased or operated by it therein or in which the

standing has not had and would not reasonably be expected to have,
individually or in the aggregate, a Parent Material Adverse Effect.

Section 5.02. _Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws_. Parent has
delivered to the Company copies of the Parent Certificate, the Parent Bylaws
and the organizational documents of Merger Sub, and the copies of such

good standing (to the extent such concept is applicable) in each jurisdiction
where the character of the properties owned, leased or operated by it or the
conduct or nature of its business makes such qualification or licensing

licensed or in good standing has not had and would not reasonably be expected
to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Parent Material Adverse Effect.

of all of the outstanding shares of capital stock or other equity interests of
each of its Subsidiaries. All of such shares and other equity interests so

(a) the Form S-4 will, at the time the Form S-4, or any amendment or
supplement thereto, is filed with the SEC or at the time it becomes effective
under the Securities Act, contain any untrue statement of a material fact or
omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in
order to make the statements made therein, in light of the circumstances under
which they are made, not misleading, and (b) the Proxy Statement will, on the
date it is first mailed to the Company Stockholders, and at the time of the
Company Stockholders Meeting, contain any untrue statement of a material fact
or omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary

portions thereof that relate only to the Company or any Subsidiary of the
Company) will comply as to form in all material respects with the applicable
requirements of the Exchange Act. Notwithstanding the foregoing, neither
Parent nor Merger Sub makes any representation or warranty with respect to
information supplied by or on behalf of the Company for inclusion or

true, correct and complete copy of the fully executed commitment letter, dated
September 21, 2014, executed and delivered by Parent and JP Morgan Chase Bank
N.A., J.P. Morgan Securities LLC, and Barclays Bank PLC and all fee letters
associated therewith (such commitment letter and related terms sheets (with
all pricing terms redacted (none of which redacted provisions will
adversely affect the availability of, or impose conditions on, the
availability of the Bridge Financing at the Closing)), together with all
annexes, exhibits, schedules and attachments thereto and each such fee letter,
in each case, as amended or otherwise modified only to the extent permitted
by this Agreement, collectively, the "Commitment Letter") to provide to
Parent, subject to the terms and conditions therein, debt financing in an
aggregate principal amount set forth therein (being collectively referred to
as the "Bridge Financing"). As of the date of this Agreement, the Commitment
Letter has not been amended or modified and the respective obligations and
commitments contained therein have not been withdrawn, terminated or
rescinded in any respect. As of the date of this Agreement, no amendment,
restatement, withdrawal, termination or other modification of the Commitment

of Parent, the other parties thereto, subject to the Bankruptcy and Equity
Exception. Parent has fully paid any and all commitment fees and other fees in
connection with the Commitment Letter that are payable on or prior to the date
of this Agreement. The net cash proceeds of the Bridge Financing contemplated

terms contemplated by this Agreement and to pay all related fees and expenses
associated therewith, including payment of all amounts under ARTICLE II and

reason to believe that any of the conditions precedent to closing of the
Bridge Financing will not be satisfied, or that the Bridge Financing will not
be made available to the Parent, in each case, at or prior to the Closing. As
of the date of this Agreement, no event has occurred which, with or without
notice, lapse of time or both, would constitute a default, event of default or
breach on the part of Parent under any term or condition of the Commitment
Letter or that would permit the financial institutions party thereto to
terminate, or to not make the initial funding of the Bridge Financing at or
prior to the Closing upon satisfaction of all conditions thereto set forth in,
in each case, the Commitment Letter. Except as set forth in the Commitment
Letter, there are no (a) conditions precedent to the respective obligations of
the lenders specified in the Commitment Letter to fund the full amount of the
Bridge Financing at or prior to the Closing; or (b) contractual contingencies
under any agreements, side letters or arrangements relating to the Bridge
Financing to which any of Parent, Merger Sub or any of their respective
Affiliates is a party that would permit the lenders specified in the
Commitment Letter to reduce the total amount of the Bridge Financing, or that
would materially and adversely affect the availability to Parent of the Bridge
Financing at or prior to the Closing.

upon arrangements made by or on behalf of Parent or any of its Subsidiaries.

 

Section 5.29. _Anti-Takeover Laws_. None of Parent, Merger Sub or any
other affiliate of Parent has been an "interested stockholder" (as such term
is used in Section 203 of DGCL) with respect to the Company at any time within
three years of the date of this Agreement.

 

Section 5.30. _No Other Representations or Warranties_. Except for the
representations and warranties contained in _ARTICLE IV_, Parent
acknowledges that none of the Company, the Subsidiaries of the Company or any
other Person on behalf of the Company makes any other express or implied
representation or warranty whatsoever, and specifically (but without limiting
the generality of the foregoing) that none of the Company, the Subsidiaries of
the Company or any other Person on behalf of the Company makes any
representation or warranty with respect to any projections or forecasts
delivered or made available to Parent or any of its Affiliates or
Representatives of future revenues, results of operations (or any component
thereof), cash flows or financial condition (or any component thereof) of the
Company and the Subsidiaries of the Company (including any such projections

individually, 

 



52  other than a direct or indirect wholly-owned Subsidiary of the Company in
the ordinary course of business and consistent with past practice;

 

(q) take any action that (i) would reasonably be expected to impose any
material delay in the obtaining of, or significantly increase the risk of not

reasonably expected to increase the risk of any Governmental Authority
entering an injunction or other legal restraint prohibiting or impeding the

Section 6.04. _Company Proxy Statement; Company Stockholders 
Meeting_.

 

(a) As soon as practicable following the date of this Agreement, the
Company and Parent shall prepare and the Company shall file with the SEC the
Proxy Statement and the Company and Parent shall prepare and Parent shall file
with the SEC the Form S-4, in which the Proxy Statement will be included as a
prospectus. Each of the Company and Parent shall use its reasonable best
efforts to have the Form S-4 declared effective under the Securities Act as
promptly as practicable after such filing and keep the Form S-4 effective for
so long as necessary to consummate the Transactions. The Company shall use
its reasonable best efforts to cause the Proxy Statement to be mailed to the
Company Stockholders as promptly as practicable after the Form S-4 is declared
effective under the Securities Act. No filing of, or amendment or supplement
to, the Form S-4 will be made by Parent, and no filing of, or amendment or
supplement to, the Proxy Statement will be made by the Company, in each case
without providing the other Party a reasonable opportunity to review and
comment thereon. If at any time prior to the Effective Time any information
relating to the Company or Parent, or any of their respective Affiliates,
directors or officers, should be discovered by the Company or Parent which
should be set forth in an amendment or supplement to either the Form S-4 or
the Proxy Statement, so that either such document would not include any
misstatement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact necessary
to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which
they were made, not misleading, the Party which discovers such information
shall promptly notify the other Parties and an appropriate amendment or
supplement describing such information shall be promptly filed with the
SEC and, to the extent required by Law, disseminated to the Company
Stockholders. The Parties shall notify each other promptly of the receipt of
any comments from the SEC or the staff of the SEC and of any request by the
SEC or the staff of the SEC for amendments or supplements to the Proxy
Statement or the Form S-4 or for additional information and shall supply each
other with copies of (i) all correspondence between it or any of its
Representatives, on the one hand, 

 



54  and the SEC or the staff of the SEC, on the other hand, with respect to the
Proxy Statement, the Form S-4 or the Transactions and (ii) all orders of the
SEC relating to the Form S-4.

 

(b) The Company shall take all actions necessary in accordance with
applicable Law, Orders and the Company Certificate and the Company Bylaws (i)
to duly call, give notice of, convene and hold a special meeting of its
stockholders as promptly as practicable, and in any event (to the extent
permissible under applicable Law and Orders) as soon as practicable following
the mailing of the definitive Proxy Statement to the Company Stockholders (but
in no event later than 45 calendar days following the date of such mailing),
for the purpose of considering the adoption of this Agreement (the " _Company
Stockholders  Meeting_") and (ii) unless the Company Board shall have
effected an Adverse Recommendation Change in accordance with _Section
6.06(d)_, (A) include in the Proxy Statement the Company Boards
recommendation that the holders of the Company Shares vote in favor of the
adoption of this Agreement (which recommendation shall be deemed a part of the
Company Board Recommendation) and (B) use its reasonable best efforts to
solicit from the Company Stockholders proxies in favor of the adoption of this
Agreement and secure the vote or consent of the Company Stockholders as
required by the rules of NASDAQ, the DGCL or other applicable Law to effect
the Merger. The Company shall give Parent no less than 10 Business Days
advance notice (or such shorter period of time as notice is provided to
NASDAQ) of the date which shall be set as the "record date" for the Company
Stockholders eligible to vote on this Agreement and the Transactions. The
Company shall consult with Parent regarding the date of the Company
Stockholders Meeting and shall not postpone or adjourn the Company
Stockholders Meeting without the prior written consent of Parent; _provided_
, _however_ , that nothing herein shall prevent the Company from postponing or
adjourning the Company Stockholders Meeting if and to the extent that: (i)
there are holders of an insufficient number of Company Shares present or
represented by a proxy at the Company Stockholders Meeting to constitute a
quorum at the Company Stockholders Meeting and the Company uses its
reasonable best efforts during any such postponement or adjournment to obtain
such a quorum as soon as practicable, (ii) the Company is required to postpone
or adjourn the Company Stockholders Meeting by applicable Law or Order or a
request from the SEC or its staff and the Company uses its reasonable
best efforts to hold or resume the Company Stockholders Meeting as soon as
practicable, or (iii) the Company Board shall have determined in good faith
(after consultation with outside legal counsel and Parent) that it is required
by Law to postpone or adjourn the Company Stockholders Meeting, including in
order to give Company Stockholders sufficient time to evaluate any information
or disclosure that the Company has sent to the Company Stockholders or
otherwise made available to the Company Stockholders by issuing a press
release or filing materials with the SEC; provided that (A) the preceding
clause (iii) shall not apply to allow a postponement or adjournment for any
information or disclosure related to an Acquisition Proposal (including any
Superior Proposal) and (B) no postponement or adjournment may be to a date on
or after five Business Days prior to the Outside Date.

 

(c) The Company shall ensure that the Company Stockholders Meeting is
called, noticed, convened, held and conducted, and that all Persons solicited
in connection with the Company Stockholders Meeting are solicited, in
compliance with all applicable Law and Orders.

 

(d) Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the Company
agrees that (i) its obligation to duly call, give notice of, convene and hold
the Company Stockholders Meeting shall not be affected by the withdrawal,
amendment or modification of the Company Board Recommendation and (ii) its
obligations pursuant to this  _Section 6.04_ shall not be affected by the
commencement, public proposal, public disclosure or communication to the
Company of any Acquisition Proposal (whether or not a Superior Proposal).
Unless this Agreement is terminated in accordance with _Section 8.01_, the
Company agrees that it shall not submit to the vote of the Company
Stockholders any Acquisition Proposal (whether or not a Superior Proposal)
prior to the vote of the Company Stockholders with respect to the Merger at
the Company Stockholders Meeting.

Section 6.05. _Access to Information; Confidentiality_.

(a) Subject to applicable Laws relating to the exchange
of information, from the date of this Agreement until the earlier to occur of
the Effective Time and the termination of this Agreement in

 



55  accordance with its terms, each of the Company and Parent shall, and shall
cause its Subsidiaries and its Representatives to, afford the other and its
Representatives (including Parents financing sources and their respective
Representatives) reasonable access during normal working hours upon reasonable
advance notice to all of its officers, employees, agents, assets, properties,
offices, plants and other facilities, books and records and shall timely
furnish the other with such financial, operating, business, financial
condition, projections and other data and information as the other or its
Representatives (including Parents financing sources, through
their Representatives), may reasonably request. Each of the Company and
Parent shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries and its Representatives to,
provide to the other Party and its Representatives (including Parents
financing sources) information that is complete and correct in all material
respects and does not and will not, when taken as a whole, contain any untrue
statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact necessary to
make the statements contained therein, in the light of the circumstances
under which such statements are made, not misleading.

(b) Any investigation conducted pursuant to the access contemplated by
this _Section 6.05_ shall be conducted in a manner that does not unreasonably
interfere with the conduct of the business of any of Parent, the Company or
any of their respective Subsidiaries or damage or destroy any property or
assets of any of Parent, the Company or any of their respective Subsidiaries.
All information obtained by the Company, Parent or Merger Sub pursuant to this
_Section 6.05_ shall be held confidential in accordance with the
Nondisclosure Agreement, dated August 11, 2014 (the " _Confidentiality
Agreement_ "), between Parent and the Company; _provided_ that nothing herein
or in the Confidentiality Agreement shall prevent Parent or its financing
sources from using all information obtained pursuant to this _Section 6.05_
or _Section 6.09_ as necessary and appropriate to consummate the Bridge
Financing and/or Replacement Financing except that material, non-public
information may not be included without the Companys prior written consent,
unless such material, non-public information has been provided specifically
for inclusion in the Bridge Financing or the Replacement Financing.

(c) After the date of this Agreement, Parent and the Company
shall cooperate to establish a mechanism acceptable to both Parent and the
Company by which Parent will be permitted, prior to the Effective Time or the
Termination Date, as the case may be, and subject to applicable Law, to
communicate directly with the Company employees regarding employee related
matters.

(d) This _Section 6.05_ shall not require either the Company or
Parent to permit any access, or to disclose any information, that in the
reasonable, good faith judgment (after consultation with outside counsel) of
such Party would reasonably be expected to result in (i) any violation of any
Contract or Law to which such Party or its Subsidiaries is a party or is
subject or cause any privilege (including attorney-client privilege) which
such Party or any of its Subsidiaries would be entitled to assert to
be undermined with respect to such information and such undermining of such
privilege could in such Partys good faith judgment (after consultation with
outside counsel) adversely affect in any material respect such Partys
position in any pending or, what such Party believes in good faith (after
consultation with outside counsel) could reasonably be expected to be, future
litigation or (ii) if such Party or any of its Subsidiaries, on the one hand,
and the other or any of its Subsidiaries, on the other hand, are adverse
parties in a litigation, such information being reasonably pertinent thereto;
_provided that_ , in the cases of clause (i), the Parties shall cooperate in
seeking to find a way to allow disclosure of such information (including by
entering into a joint-defense or similar agreement) to the extent doing so (1)
would not (in the good faith belief of the Party being requested to disclose
the information (after consultation with outside counsel)) reasonably be
likely to result in the violation of any such Contract or Law or reasonably be
likely to cause such privilege to be undermined with respect to such
information or (2) could reasonably (in the good faith belief of the Party
being requested to disclose the information (after consultation with outside
counsel)) be managed through the use of customary "clean-room" arrangements
pursuant to which non-employee Representatives of the other Party shall
be provided access to such information; _provided_ , _further_ , that the
Party being requested to disclose the information shall (x) notify the other
that such disclosures are reasonably likely to violate its or its
Subsidiaries obligations under any such Contract or Law or are reasonably
likely to cause such privilege to be undermined, (y) communicate to the other
in reasonable detail the facts giving rise to such notification and the
subject matter of such information (to the extent it is able to do so in
accordance

 



56  with the first proviso in this _Section 6.05(d)_) and (z) in the case where
such disclosures are reasonably likely to violate its or its Subsidiaries
obligations under any Contract, use reasonable commercial efforts to seek
consent from the applicable third party to any such Contract with respect to
the disclosures prohibited thereby (to the extent not otherwise expressly
prohibited by the terms of such Contract). 

(e) No investigation, or information received, pursuant to this
_Section 6.05_ will modify any of the representations and warranties of the
Parties.

Section 6.06. _No Solicitation_.

(a) The Company shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries
and Representatives to, immediately cease and terminate, or cause to be
terminated, any and all discussions, solicitations, encouragements or
negotiations with any Person conducted heretofore with respect to an
Acquisition Proposal and shall promptly request (or, to the extent the
Company is contractually permitted to do so, require) the return or
destruction of all copies of confidential information previously provided to
such parties by or on behalf of the Company, its Subsidiaries
or Representatives. From the date of this Agreement until the earlier of the
Effective Time or the termination of this Agreement in accordance with
_Section 8.01_, subject to _Section 6.06(b)_, the Company shall not, and
shall cause its Subsidiaries and Representatives not to, directly or
indirectly, (i) solicit, initiate, cause, knowingly facilitate or encourage
(including by way of furnishing information) the submission of any inquiries,
proposals or offers or any other efforts or attempts that constitute or may
reasonably be expected to lead to any Acquisition Proposal, or engage in any
discussions or negotiations with respect thereto or otherwise cooperate with
or assist or participate in, or knowingly facilitate or encourage, any such
inquiries, proposals, discussions or negotiations, or resolve to or publicly
propose to take any of the foregoing actions, (ii) approve or recommend, or
resolve to or publicly propose to approve or recommend, any Acquisition
Proposal or enter into any merger agreement, agreement-in-principle, letter of
intent, share purchase agreement, asset purchase agreement, share exchange
agreement, option agreement or other similar agreement relating to an
Acquisition Proposal or enter into any letter of intent, agreement or
agreement-in-principle requiring the Company (whether or not subject to
conditions) to abandon, terminate or fail to consummate the Merger or (iii)
(A) withdraw, modify or qualify in a manner adverse to Parent or Merger Sub
the Company Board Recommendation or the approval or declaration of
advisability by the Company Board of this Agreement and the Transactions
(including the Merger) or (B) approve or recommend, or resolve to or publicly
propose to approve or recommend, any Acquisition Proposal (any action
described in clause (A) or (B) being referred to as an " _Adverse
Recommendation Change_ ").

 

(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in _Section
6.06(a)_, if at any time following the date of this Agreement and prior to
obtaining the Company Stockholder Approval, (i) the Company has received from
a third party a written, bona fide Acquisition Proposal, (ii) a breach by the
Company of this  _Section 6.06_ has not contributed to the making of such
Acquisition Proposal, (iii) the Company Board determines in good faith, after
consultation with its financial advisors and outside counsel, that such
Acquisition Proposal constitutes or is reasonably likely to lead to a
Superior Proposal and (iv) after consultation with its outside counsel, the
Company Board determines in good faith that failure to take such action would
constitute a breach by the Company Board of its fiduciary duties to the
Company Stockholders under applicable Law, then the Company may, subject to
clauses (x), (y) and (z) below, (A) furnish confidential information with
respect to the Company and its Subsidiaries to the Person making such
Acquisition Proposal and (B) participate in discussions or negotiations with
the Person making such Acquisition Proposal regarding such Acquisition
Proposal; _provided_ _,_ _however_ , that the Company (x) will not, and will
not allow its Representatives to, disclose any non-public information to such
Person unless the Company first enters into an Acceptable Confidentiality
Agreement with such Person, (y) will promptly (and in any event within 24
hours) provide to Parent notice of its intention to enter into such Acceptable
Confidentiality Agreement and (z) will promptly (and in any event within 24
hours) provide to Parent any and all non-public information delivered to
such Person which was not previously provided to Parent.

 



57 (c) From and after the date of this Agreement and prior to the
Effective Time, the Company shall promptly (and in any event within 24 hours)
notify Parent, in writing, in the event that the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries or Representatives receives (i) any Acquisition Proposal
or indication by any Person that it is considering making an Acquisition
Proposal, (ii) any request for non-public information in contemplation of an
Acquisition Proposal relating to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or
(iii) any inquiry or request for discussions or negotiations regarding any
Acquisition Proposal. The Company shall provide Parent promptly (and in any
event within 24 hours) with the identity of such Person and a copy of such
Acquisition Proposal, indication, inquiry or request (or, where such
Acquisition Proposal is not in writing, a written description of the Companys
understanding of the material terms and conditions of such Acquisition
Proposal, indication, inquiry or request), including any modifications
thereto. The Company shall keep Parent reasonably informed on a current basis
(and in any event no later than 24 hours after the occurrence of any material
changes, developments, discussions or negotiations) of the status of
any Acquisition Proposal, indication, inquiry or request (including the
material terms and conditions thereof and of any material modification
thereto), and any material developments, discussions and negotiations,
including furnishing copies of any written inquiries, correspondence and
draft documentation, and written summaries of any material oral inquiries or
discussions. Without limiting the foregoing, the Company shall promptly (and
in any event within 24 hours) notify Parent in writing if it determines to
begin providing information or to engage in discussions or negotiations
concerning an Acquisition Proposal in accordance with _Section 6.06(b)_ and
shall in no event begin providing such information or engaging in
such discussions or negotiations prior to providing such notice. The Company
shall not, and shall cause its Subsidiaries and Representatives not to, enter
into any Contract with any Person subsequent to the date of this Agreement
that would restrict the Companys ability to provide such information
relating to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to Parent, and neither the
Company nor any of its Subsidiaries is currently party to any Contract that
prohibits the Company from providing the information relating to the Company
or any of its Subsidiaries described in this _Section 6.06(c)_ to Parent. The
Company (x) shall not, and shall cause its Subsidiaries not to, terminate,
waive, amend or modify any provision of, or grant permission or request
under, any standstill or confidentiality agreement to which it or any of its
Subsidiaries is or becomes a party and (y) shall, and shall cause its
Subsidiaries to, use reasonable best efforts to enforce the provisions of any
such agreement.

(d) Notwithstanding anything in  _Section 6.06(a)_ to the contrary,
if (i) the Company receives from a third party a written, bona fide
Acquisition Proposal, (ii) a breach by the Company of this _Section 6.06_ has
not contributed to the making of such Acquisition Proposal and (iii) the
Company Board determines in good faith, after consultation with its financial
advisors and outside counsel, that such Acquisition Proposal constitutes a
Superior Proposal after giving effect to all of the adjustments to the terms
of this Agreement which may be offered by Parent, including pursuant to clause
(III) below, the Company Board may at any time prior to the Effective Time, if
it determines in good faith, after consultation with its outside counsel,
that failure to take such action would constitute a breach by the Company
Board of its fiduciary duties to the Company Stockholders under applicable
Law, (x) effect an Adverse Recommendation Change and/or (y) terminate
this Agreement to enter into a definitive agreement with respect to such
Superior Proposal; _provided_ _,_ _however_ , that the Company shall not
terminate this Agreement pursuant to the foregoing clause (y), and any
purported termination pursuant to the foregoing clause (y) shall be void and
of no force or effect, unless in advance of or concurrently with such
termination the Company (A) pays, or causes to be paid, the Termination Fee to
Parent in immediately available funds and (B) concurrently with such
termination enters into the Alternative Acquisition Agreement; _provided_ _,_
_further_ _,_ _however_ , that the Company Board may not effect an Adverse
Recommendation Change pursuant to the foregoing clause (x) or terminate this
Agreement pursuant to the foregoing clause (y) unless (I) the Company shall
not have breached this _Section 6.06_ in a manner that contributed to the
making of such Superior Proposal, (II) the Company shall have provided prior
written notice to Parent, at least five Business Days in advance (the "
_Notice Period_ "), of its intention to take such action with respect to such
Superior Proposal, which notice shall specify the material terms and
conditions of any such Superior Proposal (including the identity of the party
making such Superior Proposal), and shall have contemporaneously provided to
Parent a copy of any proposed definitive agreement(s) with respect to such
Superior Proposal (the " _Alternative Acquisition Agreement_ "), (III) prior
to effecting such Adverse

 



58  Recommendation Change or terminating this Agreement to enter into an
Alternative Acquisition Agreement with respect to such Superior Proposal, the
Company shall, and shall cause its financial advisors and outside counsel to,
during the Notice Period, negotiate with Parent in good faith (to the extent
Parent desires to negotiate) to make such adjustments in the terms and
conditions of this Agreement so that such Acquisition Proposal ceases to
constitute a Superior Proposal and (IV) following any negotiation described in
the immediately preceding clause (III), such Acquisition Proposal (taking into
account any changes to the terms of this Agreement agreed to or proposed
by Parent in connection with the negotiations required by clause (III))
continues to constitute a Superior Proposal. In the event of any material
revisions to the terms of an Acquisition Proposal after the start of the
Notice Period, the Company shall be required to deliver a new written notice
to Parent and to comply with the requirements of this _Section 6.06(d)_ with
respect to such new written notice, and the Notice Period shall be deemed to
have re-commenced on the date of such new notice.

(e) Notwithstanding anything in _Section 6.06(a)_ to the contrary,
if (i) a material development or change in circumstances in the business,
results of operations or financial condition of the Company and its
Subsidiaries (other than and not related to an Acquisition Proposal) that was
neither known to nor reasonably foreseeable by the Company Board (assuming,
for such purpose, reasonable consultation with the executive officers of the
Company) on or prior to the date of this Agreement occurs or arises after the
date of this Agreement and prior to obtaining the Company Stockholder
Approval (such development or change, an " _Intervening Event_ "), (ii) the
Intervening Event did not result or arise from a material breach of any
provision of this Agreement and (iii) the Company Board determines in good
faith, after consultation with its outside counsel, that, in light of the
existence of such Intervening Event, the failure to make an Adverse
Recommendation Change would constitute a breach by the Company Board of its
fiduciary duties to the Company Stockholders under applicable Law, the Company
Board may, at any time prior to the Company Stockholder Approval, effect an
Adverse Recommendation Change, _provided_ that the Company Board shall not
make an Adverse Recommendation Change in light of the existence of such
Intervening Event unless (A) the Company has provided to Parent at least five
Business Days prior written notice of its intention to take such action with
respect to such Intervening Event, which notice shall specify, in reasonable
detail, the facts underlying the Company Boards determination that an
Intervening Event has occurred and the rationale and basis for such Adverse
Recommendation Change, (B) the Company shall, and shall cause its financial
advisors and outside counsel to, during such five Business Day notice period,
negotiate with Parent in good faith (to the extent Parent desires to
negotiate) to make such adjustments in the terms and conditions of this
Agreement so as to obviate the need for an Adverse Recommendation Change as a
result of the Intervening Event and (C) following any negotiation described in
the immediately preceding clause (B), the Company Board determines in good
faith, after consultation with its outside counsel, that the failure to make
such Adverse Recommendation Change in light of such Intervening Event (taking
into account any changes to the terms of this Agreement agreed to or proposed
by Parent in connection with the negotiations required by the immediately
preceding clause (B)) would constitute a breach of its fiduciary duties to the
Company Stockholders under applicable Law. In the event of any material change
in the circumstances of such Intervening Event or the occurrence of another
Intervening Event, the Company shall be required to deliver a new written
notice to Parent and to comply with the requirements of this _Section
6.06(e)_ with respect to such new written notice.

(f) Any breaches by any of the Representatives of the Company of
the restrictions set forth in this _Section 6.06_ applicable to the
Companys Subsidiaries or Representatives shall be deemed to be a breach of
the restrictions set forth in this _Section 6.06_ by the Company for all
purposes of this Agreement.

(g) Nothing contained in this _Section 6.06_ shall prohibit
the Company Board from taking and disclosing to the Company Stockholders a
position contemplated by Rule 14e-2(a), Rule 14d-9 or Item 1012(a) of
Regulation M-A promulgated under the Exchange Act; _provided_ _,_ _however_ ,
that any disclosure other than (i) a "stop, look and listen" or similar
communication of the type contemplated by Rule 14d-9(f) under the Exchange
Act, (ii) an express rejection of any applicable Acquisition Proposal or (iii)
an express reaffirmation of the Company Board Recommendation together with a
factual description of events or actions leading up to such disclosure that
have been taken by the Company and that are permitted under this _Section
6.06_ 

 



59  or actions taken or notices delivered to Parent by the Company that are
required by this _Section 6.06_, shall, in each case, be deemed to be an
Adverse Recommendation Change (including for purposes of _Section 8.01(f))_.

(h) The Company shall not take any action to exempt any Person (other
than Parent, Merger Sub and their respective Affiliates) from the provisions
of "control share acquisitions" contained in any Anti-Takeover Law or
otherwise cause such restrictions not to apply, in each case unless such
actions are taken simultaneously with a termination of this Agreement pursuant
to _Section 8.01(h)_.

 

Section 6.07. _Employee Matters_.

 

(a) From the Effective Time until the date that is 12 months after the
Closing Date, Parent shall cause the compensation and benefits package
provided to the employees of the Company and its Subsidiaries as of the
Effective Time under the Company Plans listed on _Section 4.12(a)_ of the
Company Disclosure Schedule (the " _Company Employees_ ") to be substantially
comparable to the compensation and benefits package, in the aggregate,
provided to (i) the Company Employees immediately prior to the Effective Time
and (ii) similarly situated Parent employees, in each case excluding for
purposes of this comparison any equity-based compensation; _provided_ _,_
_however_ _,_ that during such 12-month period, Parent or the Surviving
Corporation, as the case may be, may reduce the compensation or benefits of
such Company Employees if such reductions in compensation or benefits are made
equitably and as part of an across-the-board reduction applicable to all
employees within the United States.

 

(b) From and after the Effective Time, Parent shall cause the Surviving
Corporation to comply in all material respects with its obligations under all
employment and severance agreements listed on _Section 4.12(a)_ of the
Company Disclosure Schedule that are in effect as of the Effective Time, in
each case, subject to the terms and conditions of each such agreement.

(c) For purposes of eligibility, vesting and, solely with respect to
severance and vacation, level of benefit entitlement (but in no event for
purposes of benefit accrual or eligibility for retiree medical or other
retiree welfare benefits) under the Parent Plans, each Company Employee shall,
subject to applicable Law and applicable Tax qualification requirements, be
credited with his or her years of service with the Company and its
Subsidiaries and their respective predecessors before the Effective Time, to
the same extent as such Company Employee was entitled, before the Effective
Time, to credit for such service under any similar Plans in which such Company
Employee participated or was eligible to participate immediately prior to the
Effective Time; _provided_ _, _ _however_ , that the foregoing shall not
apply to the extent that its application would result in a duplication of
benefits.

 

(d) For purposes of each Parent Plan providing medical, dental,
pharmaceutical or vision benefits to any Company Employee, Parent shall use
reasonable best efforts to cause all pre-existing condition exclusions and
actively-at-work requirements of such Parent Plan to be waived for such
Company Employee and his or her covered dependents, unless such conditions
would not have been waived under a similar Plan in which such Company Employee
participated immediately prior to the Effective Time and Parent shall use
reasonable best efforts to cause any eligible expenses incurred by
such employee and his or her covered dependents under the Parent Plans during
the portion of the plan year of the Parent Plan ending on the date such
employees participation in the corresponding Parent Plan begins to be taken
into account under such Parent Plan for purposes of satisfying all deductible
and maximum out-of-pocket requirements applicable to such employee and his or
her covered dependents for the applicable plan year as if such amounts had
been paid in accordance with such Parent Plan.

(e) At Parents election, the Company shall terminate, effective as
of the day immediately preceding the Effective Time, any and all 401(k) Plans
sponsored or maintained by the Company. In such event, Parent shall receive
from the Company evidence that the Companys Plan(s) and/or program(s) have
been terminated pursuant to resolutions of the Company Board or a committee
thereof (the form and substance of

 



60  which shall be subject to review and approval of Parent), effective as of
the day immediately preceding the Effective Time.

 

(f) Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing contained in this _Section
6.07_ shall (i) be treated as an amendment of any particular Plan, (ii) give
any third party any right to enforce the provisions of this _Section 6.07_ or
(iii) require Parent or any of its Affiliates to (A) maintain any
particular Plan or (B) retain the employment of any particular employee.

Section 6.08. _Directors  and Officers Indemnification and Insurance
of the Surviving Corporation_.

(a) To the fullest extent permitted by applicable Law, Parent shall
cause the Surviving Corporation to honor all of the Companys obligations to
indemnify and hold harmless each person who is now, or has been at any time
prior to the date of this Agreement or who becomes prior to the Effective
Time an officer or director of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries (each an
" _Indemnified Party_ ") as provided in the Company Certificate or Company
Bylaws, in each case, as in effect on the date of this Agreement, or pursuant
to any other agreements in effect on the date of this Agreement, accurate and
complete copies of which have been provided to Parent and are listed in
_Section 6.08(a)_ of the Company Disclosure Schedule, including provisions
relating to the advancement of expenses incurred in the defense of any Action
or as permitted under applicable Law. Parents obligation under this _Section
6.08(a)_ shall survive the Merger and shall remain in full force and effect
for a period of not less than six years after the Effective Time. During such
period, Parent shall guarantee the obligations of the Surviving Corporation
with respect to any and all amounts payable under this  _Section 6.08_.

(b) In addition to Parents indemnification obligations pursuant to
_Section 6.08(a)_ above, prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall
purchase a "tail" officers and directors liability insurance policy, which
by its terms shall survive the Merger and shall provide each Indemnified
Party with coverage for not less than six years following the Effective Time
on terms and conditions no less favorable than the terms of the directors and
officers liability insurance policy currently maintained by the Company (a
correct and complete copy of which has been made available to Parent) in
respect of actions or omissions of such officers and directors prior to the
Effective Time in their capacities as such; _provided_ _,_ _however_ ,
that in no event shall the Company expend more than 300% of the current
annual premium paid by the Company for such policy to purchase the "tail"
policy (the " _Maximum Amount_ "); _provided_ _,_ _further_ _, _ _however_ ,
that if the amount of the annual premiums necessary to procure such insurance
coverage exceeds the Maximum Amount, the Company shall spend up to the Maximum
Amount to purchase such lesser coverage as may be obtained with such Maximum
Amount. The Indemnified Parties may be required to make reasonable application
and provide reasonable and customary representations and warranties to
applicable insurance carriers for the purpose of obtaining such insurance.

 

(c) The obligations of Parent and the Surviving Corporation under
this  _Section 6.08_ shall survive the consummation of the Merger and shall
not be terminated or modified in such a manner as to adversely affect any
Indemnified Party to whom this _Section 6.08_ applies without the consent of
such affected Indemnified Party (it being expressly agreed that the
Indemnified Parties to whom this _Section 6.08_ applies shall be third party
beneficiaries of this _Section 6.08_, each of whom may enforce the provisions
of this  _Section 6.08_).

(d) If Parent or the Surviving Corporation or any of their respective
successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any other Person
and shall not be the continuing or Surviving Corporation or entity of such
consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers all or substantially all of
its properties and assets to any Person, then, and in each such case, proper
provision shall be made so that the successors and assigns of Parent or the
Surviving Corporation, as the case may be, shall assume the obligations set
forth in this  _Section 6.08_.

Section 6.09. _Financing Arrangements_.

 

(a) Except to the extent Parent (or an Affiliate of Parent) has
consummated Replacement Financing, subject to the terms and conditions of
this Agreement, Parent will use its reasonable best efforts to

 



61  take, or cause to be taken, all actions and to do, or cause to be done, all
things necessary, proper or advisable to arrange and obtain the Bridge
Financing, if necessary, at or prior to the Closing on the terms and
conditions described in the Commitment Letter, and, without the Companys
prior written consent, will not permit any amendment or modification to be
made to, or any waiver of any provision or remedy under, the Commitment
Letter if such amendment, modification or waiver would (i) reduce the
aggregate amount of the Bridge Financing as provided in the Commitment Letter
as of the date of this Agreement (except to the extent of any consummated
Replacement Financing), or (ii) impose new or additional conditions, or
otherwise amend, modify or expand any conditions, in each case, to the receipt
by Parent at or prior to the closing of the Bridge Financing; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that Parent and Merger Sub may (i) amend the Commitment Letter to
add lenders, lead arrangers, bookrunners, syndication agents or similar
entities who had not executed the Commitment Letter as of the date of this
Agreement if the addition of such parties individually or in the aggregate,
would not reasonably be expected to materially delay or prevent the
consummation of the Bridge Financing or the Closing or (ii) otherwise amend or
replace the Commitment Letter so long as (A) such amendment does not impose
terms or conditions that would reasonably be expected to materially delay or
prevent the Closing, (B) the terms are not, taken as a whole, materially less
favorable to Parent or Merger Sub than those in the Commitment Letter as in
effect on the date of this Agreement and (C) with respect to replacements, the
replacement debt commitments otherwise satisfy the terms and conditions of an
Alternative Financing set forth below. In the event of such amendment
or replacement of the Commitment Letter as permitted by the proviso to the
immediately preceding sentence, the financing under such amended or replaced
Commitment Letter will be deemed to be "Bridge Financing" as such term is used
in this Agreement. Except to the extent Parent (or an Affiliate of Parent)
has consummated Replacement Financing, Parent shall notify the Company as soon
as reasonably practicable if, at any time prior to the Closing Date, (i) the
Commitment Letter shall expire or be terminated for any reason, (ii) any
financing source that is a party to the Commitment Letter notifies Parent that
such source no longer intends to provide financing to Parent or (iii) for any
reason Parent no longer believes in good faith that it will be able to obtain
any of the Bridge Financing substantially on the terms described in the
Commitment Letter. Parent will use its reasonable best efforts to (i) maintain
in effect the Commitment Letter (including any definitive agreements entered
into in connection therewith), (ii) satisfy when required by the Commitment
Letter as in effect on the date of this Agreement all conditions in the
Commitment Letter applicable to Parent and Merger Sub to obtaining the Bridge
Financing at or prior to the Closing, (iii) negotiate and enter into
definitive agreements with respect to the Commitment Letter on terms and
conditions contained in the Commitment Letter or consistent in all material
respects with the Commitment Letter at or prior to the Closing (such
definitive agreements, together with the Commitment Letter, the " _Financing
Agreements_ ") and promptly upon execution thereof provide complete
executed copies of such definitive agreements to the Company, (iv) upon
satisfaction of the conditions contained in the Commitment Letter, consummate
the Bridge Financing at or prior to the Closing and (v) fully enforce its
rights under the Commitment Letter. Parent will keep the Company reasonably
informed on a timely basis of the status of Parents and Merger Subs efforts
to arrange the Bridge Financing and to satisfy the conditions thereof,
including, upon Companys reasonable request, advising and updating the
Company, in a reasonable level of detail, with respect to status, proposed
closing date under the Financing Agreements (which shall be at or prior to the
Closing) and material terms of the material definitive documentation for the
Bridge Financing, _provided_ that, except as required by _Section 6.05_, in
no event will Parent be under any obligation to disclose any information that
is subject to attorney-client or similar privilege if Parent shall have used
reasonable best efforts to disclose such information in a way that would not
waive such privilege.

 

(b) Except to the extent Parent has consummated Replacement Financing,
if the Commitment Letter shall expire or terminate for any reason, or if any
portion of that amount of the Bridge Financing necessary to consummate the
Transactions becomes reasonably likely to be unavailable on the material terms
and conditions contemplated by the applicable Financing Agreements, (i)
Parent will promptly notify the Company and (ii) Parent will use its
reasonable best efforts to arrange and obtain, as promptly as practicable
following the occurrence of such event, a new debt financing commitment that
provides for a debt financing, the net cash proceeds of which, together with
cash and cash equivalents available to Parent, will be sufficient to
consummate the Transactions and to pay the Required Amount, in each
case, with conditions not materially less favorable, taken as a whole, to
Parent, Merger Sub and the Company than the conditions set forth in the

 



62  Commitment Letter as in effect on the date of this Agreement, which new
commitment shall include a termination date not earlier than the Outside Date
(" _Alternative Financing_ "). In such event, (i) the term "Bridge Financing"
as used in this Agreement will be deemed to include the Alternative Financing,
(ii) the term "Commitment Letter" will be deemed to include any commitment
letters, together with all annexes, exhibits, schedules and attachments
thereto, and all term sheets and fee letters related thereto, in each case,
with respect to the Alternative Financing, and (iii) the term "Financing
Agreements" will be deemed to include any definitive agreement with respect
to the Alternative Financing. Parent shall accept any such commitment letters
if the funding conditions and other terms and conditions contained therein are
not materially adverse to Parent in comparison with those contained in the
Commitment Letter as in effect on the date of this Agreement.

 

(c) Prior to the Closing, and without limiting its obligations pursuant
to  _Section 6.05(a)_, the Company shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries
to, and shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause their respective
Representatives to, in each case, provide to Parent all cooperation reasonably
requested by Parent in connection with the arrangement and consummation of
the Bridge Financing and/or Replacement Financing (including the satisfaction
of the conditions precedent set forth therein), including, without limitation
(in each case, to the extent reasonably requested):

(i) participating in a reasonable number of meetings, presentations,
road shows, due diligence sessions, drafting sessions and sessions between
senior management and prospective lenders, investors and rating agencies;

 

(ii) assisting with the preparation by Parent of materials for rating
agency presentations (and assisting in the obtaining of corporate, credit and
facility ratings by Parent from ratings agencies), offering documents, private
placement memoranda, bank information memoranda and similar documents required
in connection with such financing and all documentation and, if required in
writing by Parent at least 10 Business Days prior to the Closing Date, furnish
Parent within three Business Days of the Closing Date all information required
in connection with applicable "know your customer" and anti-money laundering
rules and regulations, including the U.S.A. Patriot Act of 2001;

 

(iii) using its reasonable best efforts to (A) execute and deliver any
pledge and security documents, currency or interest hedging arrangements,
other definitive financing documents, and any other documents reasonably
requested by Parent in connection with facilitating the pledge of collateral,
including Intellectual Property, in each case provided such documents,
arrangements and other financing documents are effective following the Closing
and are conditioned on consummation of the Merger, and (B) seek to obtain the
consent of accountants for use of their reports in any materials relating to
the Replacement Financing;

(iv) (A) furnishing to Parent and its financing sources all audited
and unaudited financial statements, business and other financial data, audit
reports and other information regarding the Company of the type customarily
included in offering memoranda for private placements pursuant to Rule 144A
under the Securities Act (other than (i) separate financial statements and
footnote disclosures with respect to guarantors required by Rule 3-10 of
Regulation S-X under the Securities Act, it being understood that
customary non-guarantor financial information on a percentage basis shall be
provided, and (ii) separate financial statements with respect to subsidiaries
pursuant to Rule 3-16 of Regulation S-X under the Securities Act), to
consummate a Rule 144A offering of debt securities (provided that Parent
shall be responsible for the preparation of pro forma financial statements),
and such information shall be of the type and form that would be necessary for
the investment banks to receive from the Companys independent accountants
customary (for high yield debt securities) "comfort" (including "negative
assurance" comfort) with respect to the financial information to be included
in such offering documents and other pertinent information regarding the
Company and its Subsidiaries as may be reasonably requested in writing by
Parent; and (B) furnishing to Parent and its financing sources information
required in connection with confidential information memoranda and the
lenders presentation in respect of the Bridge Financing or Replacement
Financing, in each case customarily used for the syndication of either such
financing;

 



63 (v) providing customary authorization and management representation
letters representing (without any knowledge or similar qualifier) that the
information contained in any confidential information memorandum or lender
presentation does not include any material non-public information about the
Company and its Subsidiaries and designating the information provided to
Parents financing sources as suitable to be made available to lenders who do
not wish to receive such material non-public information;

 

(vi) providing monthly financial statements (excluding footnotes) of
the Company to the extent the Company customarily prepares such financial
statements and pursuant to the historical practices of the Company;

 

(vii) using reasonable best efforts to assist Parent in obtaining
accountants comfort letters, consents, surveys, legal opinions from local
outside counsel (and not internal counsel) and title insurance as reasonably
requested by Parent for the Bridge Financing and/or Replacement Financing; and

 

(viii) subject to _Section 6.05_, taking all actions reasonably
necessary to (A) permit the prospective lenders involved in the Bridge
Financing and/or Replacement Financing to evaluate the Company and its
Subsidiaries current assets, cash management and accounting systems, policies
and procedures relating thereto for the purpose of establishing collateral
arrangements, (B) establish bank and other accounts and blocked account
agreements and lock box arrangements in connection with the Bridge Financing
to take effect at the Closing, and (C) permit representatives of the
prospective lenders to conduct commercial field examinations, inventory
appraisals and an appraisal of the owned real estate, and use commercially
reasonable efforts to make audits and appraisals available to the Parent
for purposes of the Bridge Financing, _provided_ , _however_ , that
notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this clause (vi), in no event
shall Parent or any such lender be permitted to contact any customer, vendor
or supplier of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries without the Companys
prior written consent.

Nothing in this _Section 6.09(c)_ shall require such cooperation to the
extent it would interfere unreasonably with the business or operations of the
Company or its Subsidiaries. Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries
shall be required pursuant to this _Section 6.09(c)_ to enter into or
perform under any certificate, agreement, document or other instrument that is
not contingent upon the Closing or that would be effective prior to the
Effective Time (other than the authorization letters and representation
letters referred to in clause (iv) above). Notwithstanding the foregoing,
under no circumstance shall the Company or its Subsidiaries be required to
authorize (and Parent and none of Parents financing sources or any other
lender to Parent is permitted to make), any pre-filing of any UCC-1s or
other documents which create Liens. None of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries shall be required to take any action pursuant to this _Section
6.09(c)_ that would subject it to actual or potential liability for which it
would not be indemnified hereunder or to bear any cost or expense or to pay
any commitment or other similar fee or make any other payment (other than
reasonable out-of-pocket costs) or provide or agree to provide any indemnity
in connection with the Bridge Financing, Replacement Financing or any of the
foregoing prior to the Effective Time. Parent shall, promptly upon request by
the Company, reimburse the Company for all reasonable out-of-pocket costs
incurred by the Company or its Subsidiaries in connection with this _Section
6.09(c)_. Parent shall indemnify and hold harmless the Company, its
Subsidiaries and their respective Representatives from and against any and
all liabilities suffered or incurred by any of their officers, directors or
employees in connection with the Bridge Financing or Replacement Financing,
except to the extent such liabilities arose out of or resulted from (i)
information provided by or on behalf of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries or any of its or their respective Representatives or (ii) the
gross negligence, fraud, bad faith, willful misconduct, intentional
misrepresentation, or intentional breach of this Agreement by the Company,
any of its Subsidiaries or any of its or their respective Representatives. The
Company hereby consents to the use of its and its Subsidiaries logos in
connection with the Bridge Financing or Replacement Financing,  _provided_
that such logos shall be used solely in a manner that is not intended or
reasonably likely to harm, disparage or otherwise adversely affect the Company
or any of its Subsidiaries.

 



64 (d) Parent and Merger Sub acknowledge and agree that the obtaining of
the Bridge Financing or Replacement Financing is not a condition to the
Closing. For the avoidance of doubt, if the Bridge Financing or Replacement
Financing has not been obtained, Parent will continue to be obligated,
subject to the fulfillment or waiver of the conditions set forth in _ARTICLE
VII_, to complete the Merger and consummate the other Transactions.

 

(e) If requested by Parent, the Company shall provide reasonable
cooperation to Parent and Merger Sub in arranging for, at the Closing, the
termination or redemption of (i) the indebtedness of the Company set forth on
_Section 6.09(e)_ of the Company Disclosure Schedule and (ii) any other
indebtedness of the Company and its Subsidiaries, together with the
procurement of customary payoff letters in connection therewith; _provided_
that in no event shall this _Section 6.09(e)_ require the Company to cause
any indebtedness of the Company and its Subsidiaries to be terminated unless
(i) the Company has received from Parent funds to pay in full the payoff
amount for any such indebtedness and (ii) Parent has agreed to and has
provided backstop letters of credit or cash collateralized any existing
letters of credit and guarantees and hedging arrangements and other bank
products thereunder in a manner reasonably satisfactory to the lenders or
holders of such indebtedness, to the extent applicable.

 

Section 6.10. _Further Action; Efforts_.

 

(a) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall use its reasonable
best efforts to obtain any consents, approvals or waivers of third parties
with respect to any Contracts to which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
is a party as may be necessary or appropriate for the consummation of the
Transactions or required by the terms of any Contract as a result of the
execution, performance or consummation of the Transactions. Subject to the
terms and conditions of this Agreement, prior to the Effective Time, each of
the Company, Parent and Merger Sub shall, as promptly as practicable, use its
reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all other actions and
do, or cause to be done, all other things necessary, proper or advisable under
applicable Law to consummate the Transactions. In furtherance and not in
limitation of the foregoing, each of the Company, Parent and Merger Sub shall
(i) make all appropriate filings and submissions (and filings and submissions
considered by Parent to be advisable) under the HSR Act and with any other
Governmental Authority pursuant to any other applicable Antitrust Laws or
otherwise, as promptly as practicable, but in no event later than 10 Business
Days after the date of this Agreement with respect to filing under the HSR
Act, and shall make as promptly as practicable any other appropriate
submissions under other applicable Antitrust Laws, (ii) use reasonable best
efforts to obtain as promptly as practicable the termination of any waiting
period under the HSR Act and any applicable foreign Antitrust Laws, (iii)
cooperate and consult with each other in (A) determining which filings are
required to be made prior to the Effective Time with, and which material
consents, approvals, permits, notices or authorizations are required to be
obtained prior to the Effective Time from, Governmental Authorities in
connection with the execution and delivery of this Agreement and consummation
of the Transactions and (B) timely making all such filings and timely seeking
all such consents, approvals, permits, notices or authorizations.

(b) In connection with, and without limiting, the efforts referenced
in _Section 6.10(a)_, each of the Company, on the one hand, and Parent and
Merger Sub, on the other hand, will (i) cooperate in all respects with each
other in connection with any filing or submission and in connection with any
investigation or other inquiry, including any proceeding initiated by a
private party, (ii) keep the other reasonably informed of any communication
received by it from, or given by it to, the Federal Trade Commission (the "
_FTC_ "), the Antitrust Division of the Department of Justice (the " _DOJ_ ")
or any other United States or foreign Governmental Authority and of any
communication received or given in connection with any proceeding by a
private party, in each case regarding the Transactions and (iii) permit the
other to review any communication given by it to, and consult with each other
in advance of any meeting or conference with, the FTC, the DOJ or any other
Governmental Authority (other than the Defense Security Service) or, in
connection with any proceeding by a private party, with any other Person, and
to the extent permitted by the FTC, the DOJ or such other applicable
Governmental Authority (other than the Defense Security Service) or other
Person, give the other the opportunity to attend and participate in such
meetings and conferences.

 



65 (c) In furtherance and not in limitation of the covenants of the
Parties contained in _Section 6.10(a)_ and _Section 6.10(b)_, if any
objections are asserted with respect to the Transactions under any Antitrust
Law or if any suit is instituted (or threatened to be instituted) by the FTC,
the DOJ or any other applicable Governmental Authority or any private party
challenging any of the Transactions as violative of any Antitrust Law or which
would otherwise prevent, materially impede or materially delay the
consummation of the Transactions, each of Parent, Merger Sub and the Company
shall use its reasonable best efforts to resolve any such objections or suits
so as to permit consummation of the Transactions, including in order to
resolve such objections or suits which, in any case if not resolved, could
reasonably be expected to prevent, materially impede or materially delay the
consummation of the Transactions.

 

(d) In the event that any administrative or judicial action or
proceeding is instituted (or threatened to be instituted) by a Governmental
Authority or private party challenging the Merger or any other Transaction,
each of Parent, Merger Sub and the Company shall cooperate in all respects
with each other and use its respective reasonable best efforts to vigorously
contest and resist any such action or proceeding and to have vacated, lifted,
reversed or overturned any decree, judgment, injunction or other Order,
whether temporary, preliminary or permanent, that is in effect and
that prohibits, prevents or restricts consummation of the Transactions;
_provided_ , _however_ , that no Party shall make any offer, acceptance or
counter-offer to, or otherwise engage in discussions with, any Governmental
Authority with respect to any proposed settlement, consent decree, commitment
or remedy, or, in the event of litigation, discovery, admissibility of
evidence, timing or scheduling, except as specifically requested or agreed to
by the other Parties, which agreement shall not be unreasonably withheld,
delayed or conditioned. Each Party shall use its reasonable best efforts to
provide full and effective support the other Parties in all material respects
in all such negotiations and discussions to the extent reasonably requested
by any such other Party.

(e) Notwithstanding the foregoing or any other provision of this
Agreement, (i) nothing in this _Section 6.10_ shall limit a Partys right to
terminate this Agreement pursuant to _Section 8.01_ and (ii) nothing in this
Agreement shall obligate Parent, Merger Sub or any of their respective
Affiliates to agree to (A) sell, hold separate or otherwise dispose of all or
a portion of its respective business, assets or properties, or conduct its
business in a specified manner, (B) pay any amounts (other than the payment
of filing fees and expenses and fees of counsel), or grant any counterparty to
any Contract any material accommodation, (C) commence or defend any Action or
claim in respect of any threatened Action, (D) limit in any manner whatsoever
the ability of such entities to conduct, own, operate or control any of their
respective businesses, assets or properties or of the businesses, properties
or assets of the Company and its Subsidiaries or (E) waive any of the
conditions set forth in _ARTICLE VII_ of this Agreement. Without the prior
written consent of Parent, none of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
shall, in response to any objections asserted with respect to the Transactions
under any Antitrust Law or any suit instituted (or threatened to be
instituted) by the FTC, the DOJ or any other applicable Governmental Authority
or any private party challenging any of the Transactions as violative of any
Antitrust Law, (A) sell, hold separate or otherwise dispose of all or a
portion of their respective businesses, assets or properties, or conduct their
business in a specified manner, (B) pay any amounts (other than the payment of
filing fees and expenses and fees of counsel), or grant any counterparty to
any Contract any material accommodation, (C) commence or defend any Action or
claim in respect of any threatened Action or (D) limit in any manner
whatsoever the ability of such entities to conduct, own, operate or control
any of their respective businesses, assets or properties.

 

(f) Without limiting the generality of _Section 6.10(a)_, each of
Parent and the Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to submit a
draft joint voluntary notice and, following the receipt of any comments
thereto, a final joint voluntary notice, to CFIUS (the " _Exon-Florio Filing_
") as promptly as reasonably practicable following the date of this
Agreement. Parent and the Company shall cooperate in preparing, pre-filing and
filing with CFIUS a joint voluntary notice of the Transactions in accordance
with applicable Law. Each of Parent and the Company shall use its reasonable
best efforts to respond as promptly as reasonably practicable (but in any
event within the time required to avoid possible rejection or deferred
acceptance of the Exon-Florio Filing under 

 



66  31 C.F.R. § 800.403) to any inquiries or requests received from CFIUS in
connection with such joint voluntary notice. Each of Parent and the Company
shall use its reasonable best efforts to obtain the CFIUS Approval.

Section 6.11. _Public Announcements_. The Parties agree that no public
release or announcement concerning the Transactions shall be issued by a Party
without the prior consent of the other Parties (which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned), except as such release
or announcement may be required by applicable Law or rules of NASDAQ, in
which case the Party required to make the release or announcement shall use
its reasonable best efforts to allow the other Parties reasonable time to
comment on such release or announcement in advance of such issuance. The
Parties have agreed upon the form of a joint press release announcing the
Transactions and the execution of this Agreement.

 

Section 6.12. _Anti-Takeover Laws_. If any Anti-Takeover Law is or may
become applicable to any Transaction, (a) the Parties shall use reasonable
best efforts to take such actions as are reasonably necessary so that the
Transactions may be consummated as promptly as practicable on the terms
contemplated hereby and (b) the Company Board shall take all actions
necessary to render such statutes inapplicable to any Transaction.

Section 6.13. _Securityholder Litigation_. The Company shall give
Parent the opportunity to participate in the defense or settlement of any
securityholder litigation against the Company and/or its directors relating
to the Transactions, and no such settlement shall be agreed to without
Parents prior written consent (which consent shall not be unreasonably
withheld, delayed or conditioned).

 

Section 6.14. _Notification of Certain Matters_. The Company shall give
prompt notice to Parent and Merger Sub and Parent and Merger Sub shall give
prompt notice to the Company of (a) any written notice or other communication
received from any Person alleging that the consent of such Person is required
in connection with the Transactions, (b) any notice from any Governmental
Authority in connection with the Transactions, (c) any Actions or claims
commenced or, to such Partys Knowledge, threatened against, relating to or
involving or otherwise affecting such Party or any of its Subsidiaries that
relate to the Transactions, (d) the discovery of any fact or circumstance, or
the occurrence or non-occurrence of any event, that would cause any
representation or warranty made by such Party contained in this Agreement to
be, with respect to the Company, untrue or inaccurate such that the condition
set forth in _Section 7.02(a)_ would not be satisfied, and with respect to
Parent and Merger Sub, untrue or inaccurate such that the condition set forth
in _Section 7.03(a)_ would not be satisfied, and (e) any material failure of
such Party to comply with or satisfy any covenant or agreement to be complied
with or satisfied by it hereunder; _provided_ , _however_ , that the delivery
of any notice pursuant to this _Section 6.14_ shall not (i) cure any breach
of, or non-compliance with, any other provision of this Agreement or (ii)
limit the remedies available to the Party receiving such notice. 

Section 6.15. _Company and Parent SEC Reports_.

 

(a) From the date of this Agreement to the Effective Time, the Company
shall timely file with the SEC all Company SEC Reports required to be filed
by it under the Exchange Act or the Securities Act. As of its filing date, or
if amended after the date of this Agreement, as of the date of the last such
amendment, each such Company SEC Report shall fully comply with the

incapable of being cured or has not been cured prior to the Outside Date;
_provided_ _,_ _however_ , that neither Parent nor Merger Sub is then in

or inaccuracy (A) would give rise to the failure of the condition set forth in
_Section 7.03(a)_ or  _Section 7.03(b)_ and (B) is incapable of being cured
or has not been cured prior to the Outside Date; _provided_ _,_ _however_ ,

Section 8.03. _Fees and Expenses_.

 

(a) Except as otherwise set forth in this _Section 8.03_, all fees and
expenses incurred in connection with the Transactions, including all legal,
accounting, financial advisory, consulting and all other fees and expenses of
third parties incurred by a Party in connection with the negotiation and
effectuation of the terms and conditions of this Agreement and the
Transactions, shall be the obligation of the respective Party incurring such
fees and expenses, whether or not the Merger is consummated (it being agreed

expenses incurred in connection with the filing and printing of the Form S-4
and Proxy Statement included therein and for mailing it to Company
Stockholders, and (ii) all required filing fees under the HSR Act).

 

(b) In the event this Agreement shall be terminated:

 

(i) by (A) the Company pursuant to _Section 8.01(h)_ or (B)
Parent pursuant to _Section 8.01(f)_, the Company shall pay to Parent the
Termination Fee; or

 

(ii) (A) by Parent or the Company pursuant to _Section 8.01(b)_ or by
Parent pursuant to _Section 8.01(d)_ or _Section 8.01(e)_, (B) at or prior
to the date of termination, an Acquisition Proposal shall have been made known
to the Company or shall have been made directly to the Company

intention to make an Acquisition Proposal (whether or not conditional or
withdrawn) and (C) concurrently with such termination or within 12 months
following such termination, the Company enters into an Alternative
Acquisition Agreement to consummate or consummates a transaction contemplated
by any Acquisition Proposal, then the Company shall pay, or cause to be paid,
to Parent

 



71  the Termination Fee upon the earlier to occur of the Companys entering into
an Alternative Acquisition Agreement or the consummation of such Acquisition
Proposal. For purposes of this  _Section 8.03(b)(ii)_, " _Acquisition
Proposal_ " shall have the meaning assigned thereto in _Section 1.01_ except
that references in the definition to "15%" and "85%" shall be replaced
by "50%."

(c) In the event this Agreement shall be terminated by Parent or
the Company pursuant to _Section 8.01(e)_ after a Bona Fide Proposal shall
have been made, the Company shall promptly pay to Parent all documented out-
of-pocket costs and expenses incurred by Parent and Merger Sub in connection
with this Agreement and the Transactions up to a maximum amount equal to
$4,000,000 (the " _Expense Reimbursement_ "); provided that in the event the
Expense Reimbursement is paid and a Termination Fee is thereafter payable
pursuant to  _Section 8.03(b)(ii)_, the Termination Fee otherwise payable
shall be reduced by the amount of the Expense Reimbursement.

 

(d) In the event this Agreement shall be terminated by Parent or the
Company pursuant to  _Section 8.01(b)_ (but for purposes of _Section
8.01(b)_ only if one or more of the Regulatory Conditions has not been
satisfied prior to the date of termination) or _Section 8.01(c)_ (but for
purposes of  _Section 8.01(c)_ only if such illegality or prohibition is
attributable to an Antitrust Law or Exon-Florio or otherwise seeking approval
under an Antitrust Law or CFIUS Approval) and all of the conditions to Closing
set forth in  _ARTICLE VII_ (other than (i) the conditions set forth in
_Section 7.01(b)_, _Section 7.01(c)_ (but for purposes of _Section 7.01(c)_
only if such restraint or prohibition is attributable to an Antitrust Law or
Exon-Florio or otherwise seeking approval under an Antitrust Law or CFIUS
Approval) or _Section 7.01(d)_ and (ii) those other conditions that, by their
nature, cannot be satisfied until the Closing Date, but, in the case of
clause (ii), which conditions could be satisfied if the Closing Date were the
date of such termination) have been satisfied or waived on or prior to the
date of such termination, then Parent shall pay to the Company the Reverse
Breakup Fee. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contemplated in this
Agreement, in the event the Closing does not occur and the Company has the
right to receive the Reverse Breakup Fee pursuant to this _Section 8.03(d)_,
such Reverse Breakup Fee, together with applicable costs of collection, if
any, payable pursuant to _Section 8.03(e)_ shall be the exclusive remedies of
the Company against Parent and Merger Sub for any loss, cost, liability or
expense relating to or arising under this Agreement or the Transactions,
including the failure of Parent and Merger Sub to consummate the Merger;
_provided_ , _however_ , that nothing in this _Section 8.03(d)_ shall relieve
Parent or Merger Sub from any liability for, or eliminate or preclude any
remedies of the Company against Parent or Merger Sub in respect of, any
intentional breach of this Agreement by Parent or Merger Sub prior to the
termination of this Agreement.

 

(e) The Company, Parent and Merger Sub each acknowledge that the
agreements contained in this  _Section 8.03_ are an integral part of the
Agreement and the Transactions and that, without these agreements, the other
Parties would not enter into this Agreement. Except with respect to _Section
8.01(h)_ (in which case the Termination Fee shall be paid by the Company in
accordance with _Section 6.06(d)_) or in the case where the Termination Fee
is payable pursuant to _Section 8.03(b)(ii)_ (in which case the Termination
Fee shall be paid by the Company in accordance with _Section 8.03(b)(ii)_),
the Termination Fee, Expense Reimbursement or Reverse Breakup Fee, as
applicable, shall be paid by Parent or the Company, as applicable, as directed
by Parent or the Company in writing in immediately available funds promptly
following (and in any event within two Business Days after) the date of the
event giving rise to the obligation to make such payment. In the event that
the Company or Parent, as applicable, shall fail to pay the Termination Fee,
Expense Reimbursement or Reverse Breakup Fee required pursuant to this
_Section 8.03_ when due, such Termination Fee, Expense Reimbursement or
Reverse Breakup Fee, as the case may be, shall accrue interest for the
period commencing on the date such Termination Fee, Expense Reimbursement or
Reverse Breakup Fee, as the case may be, became past due, at the rate of
interest per annum equal to the "Prime Rate" as set forth on the date such
payment became past due in The Wall Street Journal "Money Rates" column plus
350 basis points. In addition, if a Party shall fail to pay any Termination
Fee, Expense Reimbursement or Reverse Breakup Fee, as the case may be, when
due, such Party shall also pay to the Party entitled to such Termination Fee,
Expense Reimbursement or Reverse Breakup Fee, as applicable, such non-paying
Partys costs and expenses (including attorneys fees) incurred in connection
with efforts to collect such Termination Fee, Expense Reimbursement or
Reverse Breakup Fee, as the case may be.

 



72  For the avoidance of doubt and notwithstanding any other provision of this
Agreement to the contrary, in no event will a Party be obligated to pay a
Termination Fee, Expense Reimbursement or Reverse Breakup Fee, as the case
may be, on more than one occasion.

(f) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, the Company, its
Subsidiaries and the Representatives and Affiliates of the Company and its
Subsidiaries shall not have any rights or claims against any Parent financing
source (including, without limitation, the parties to the Commitment Letter)
in connection with the Transactions, including the Bridge Financing or any
Replacement Financing, whether at law or equity, in contract, in tort or
otherwise.

 

Section 8.04. _Amendment_. This Agreement may be amended by the Parties
hereto by action taken by their respective boards of directors (or similar
governing bodies or entities) at any time prior to the Effective Time;
_provided_ , _however_ , _that_ , after Company Stockholder Approval has been
obtained, no amendment may be made without further stockholder approval
which, by Law or in accordance with the rules of NASDAQ, requires further
approval by such stockholders. This Agreement may not be amended except by an
instrument in writing signed by the Parties. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
the provisions of _Section 6.05(a)_, _Section 6.05(b)_, _Section 6.09_,
_Section 8.03(f)_, this _Section 8.04_, _Section 9.06_, _Section 9.07_
and  _Section 9.08_, to the extent affecting any of the Parents financing
sources, may not be amended, modified or waived (including any defined term
used therein) without the prior written consent of each of Parents
financing sources participating in Replacement Financing or, to the extent
Parent or an Affiliate of Parent has not consummated Replacement Financing,
the Bridge Financing, as applicable.

 

Section 8.05. _Waiver_. At any time prior to the Effective Time, the
Company, on the one hand, and Parent and Merger Sub, on the other hand, may
(a) extend the time for the performance of any obligation or other act of the
other, (b) waive any inaccuracy in the representations and warranties of the
other contained herein or in any document delivered pursuant hereto and (c)
waive compliance with any agreement of the other or any condition to its own
obligations contained herein. Any such extension or waiver shall be valid if
set forth in an instrument in writing signed by the Company or Parent (on
behalf of Parent and Merger Sub). The waiver by any Party of a breach of any
provision hereunder shall not operate or be construed as a waiver of any prior
or subsequent breach of the same or any other provision hereunder. The
failure of any Party to assert any of its rights under this Agreement or
otherwise shall not constitute a waiver of those rights.

Section 9.03. _Severability_. If any term or other provision of this
Agreement is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced by any rule of
Law or public policy or the application of this Agreement to any Person or
circumstance is invalid or incapable of being enforced by any rule of Law
or public policy, all other conditions and provisions of this Agreement shall
nevertheless remain in full force and effect so long as the economic or legal
substance of the Transactions is not affected in any manner materially adverse
to any Party. To such end, the provisions of this Agreement are agreed to be
severable. Upon such determination that any term or other provision is
invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced, the Parties shall negotiate
in good faith to modify this Agreement so as to effect the original intent of
the Parties as closely as possible in a mutually acceptable manner in order
that the Transactions be consummated as originally contemplated to the fullest
extent possible.

 



74 Section 9.04. _Entire Agreement; Assignment_. This Agreement, together
with the Confidentiality Agreement, the Company Disclosure Schedule and the
Parent Disclosure Schedule, constitute the entire agreement among the Parties
with respect to the subject matter of this Agreement, and supersede all prior
agreements and undertakings, both written and oral, among the Parties, or any
of them, with respect to the subject matter of this Agreement. Notwithstanding
the forgoing, the Company acknowledges and agrees that, upon execution of
this Agreement, each of Parents potential financing sources shall be
considered a Representative (as defined in the Confidentiality Agreement) of
Parent for all purposes under the Confidentiality Agreement. This
Agreement shall not be assigned, whether pursuant to a merger, by operation
of law or otherwise; _provided_ that Merger Sub may assign, in its sole
discretion, any or all of its rights, interests and obligations under this
Agreement to any wholly owned subsidiary of Parent without the consent of the
Company.

Section 9.05. _Specific Performance_. The Parties agree that
irreparable damage would occur in the event any provision of this Agreement
were not performed in accordance with the terms of this Agreement and that
money damages would not be a sufficient remedy for any breach of this
Agreement, and accordingly, the Parties shall be entitled to specific
performance of the terms of this Agreement, without any requirement to post
bond, in addition to any other remedy at law or equity. The Parties
further agree not to assert that a remedy of specific enforcement is
unenforceable, invalid, contrary to law or inequitable for any reason, nor to
assert that a remedy of monetary damages would provide an adequate remedy.

 

Section 9.06. _Parties in Interest_. This Agreement shall be binding
upon and inure solely to the benefit of each Party, and nothing in this
Agreement, express or implied, is intended to or shall confer upon any other
Person any right, benefit or remedy of any nature whatsoever under or by
reason of this Agreement, other than the provisions of _Section 6.08_ and
_Section 6.09(c)_ (which are intended to be for the benefit of the Persons
covered thereby or the Persons entitled to payment thereunder and may be
enforced by such Persons). Notwithstanding the foregoing, Parents financing
sources are intended third party beneficiaries under the provisions of
_Section 6.05(a)_, _Section 6.05(b)_, _Section 6.09_, _Section 8.03(f)_,
_Section 8.04_,  _Section 9.04_, this _Section 9.06_, _Section 9.07_ and
_Section 9.08_.

Section 9.07. _Governing Law; Forum_.

(a) All disputes, claims or controversies arising out of or relating
to this Agreement, or the negotiation, validity or performance of this
Agreement, or the Transactions shall be governed by and construed in
accordance with the laws of the State of Delaware without regard to its rules
of conflict of laws.

(b) All Actions arising out of or relating to this Agreement shall be
heard and determined in the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware (or,
only if the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware declines to accept
jurisdiction over a particular matter, any federal court within the State of
Delaware). The Parties hereby (i) submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of the
Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware (or, only if the Court of Chancery
of the State of Delaware declines to accept jurisdiction over a particular
matter, any federal court within the State of Delaware) for the purpose of
any Action arising out of or relating to this Agreement brought by any Party
and (ii) irrevocably waive, and agree not to assert by way of motion, defense,
or otherwise, in any such Action, any claim that it is not subject personally
to the jurisdiction of the above-named courts, that its property is exempt or
immune from attachment or execution, that any such Action is brought in an
inconvenient forum, that the venue of such Action is improper, or that this
Agreement or the Transactions may not be enforced in or by any of the above-
named courts. Each of the Parties agrees that mailing of process or other
papers in connection with any action or proceeding in the manner provided in
_Section 9.02_ or such other manner as may be permitted by Law shall be valid
and sufficient service of process.

 

(c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, each of
the Parties agrees that it will not bring or support, nor will it permit any
of its Affiliates to bring or support, any action, cause of action, claim,
cross-claim or third-party claim of any kind or description, whether in law or
in equity, whether in contract or in tort or otherwise, against Parents
financing sources in any way relating to this Agreement or any

 



75  of the Transactions, including any dispute arising out of or relating in any
way to the Commitment Letter or the performance thereof, in any forum other
than the Supreme Court of the State of New York, County of New York, or, if
under applicable Law exclusive jurisdiction is vested in the federal courts,
the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York (and
appellate courts thereof). The Parties further agree that all of the
provisions of _Section 9.08_ relating to waiver of jury trial shall apply to
any action, cause of action, claim, cross-claim or third-party claim reference
in this _Section 9.07(c)_. The provisions of this  _Section 9.07(c)_ shall
be enforceable by each of Parents financing sources and their respective
Affiliates, successors and permitted assigns.

 

Section 9.08. _Waiver of Jury Trial_. EACH OF THE PARTIES HEREBY WAIVES
TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW ANY RIGHT IT MAY HAVE TO A
TRIAL BY JURY WITH RESPECT TO ANY LITIGATION DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY ARISING
OUT OF, UNDER OR IN CONNECTION WITH THIS AGREEMENT OR THE TRANSACTIONS. Each
of the Parties (a) certifies that no representative, agent or attorney of any
other Party has represented, expressly or otherwise, that such other Party
would not, in the event of litigation, seek to enforce that foregoing waiver
and (b) acknowledges that it and the other Parties have been induced to enter
into this Agreement and the Transactions, as applicable, by, among other
things, the mutual waivers and certifications in this _Section 9.08_.

 

Section 9.09. _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed and
delivered (including by facsimile or other form of electronic transmission)
in two or more counterparts, and by the different Parties in separate
counterparts, each of which when executed shall be deemed to be an original
but all of which taken together shall constitute one and the same agreement.
