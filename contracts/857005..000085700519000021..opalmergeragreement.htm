Any claim for indemnification under this Agreement pursuant to Section 10.2(a) shall be deemed time-barred, and no such claim shall be made after the Survival Period; provided, however, that if a claim notice is delivered in good faith pursuant to Section 10.4 with respect to such a claim for indemnification prior to the expiration of the applicable Survival Period, the indemnification claim under this Section 10 shall survive until such indemnification claim is finally resolved pursuant to this Section 10. The representations and warranties contained in Sections 2.1(a) (Organization and Qualification), 2.2 (Capitalization; Subsidiaries), 2.3 (Authority; Enforceability), and 2.22 (Brokers) are sometimes referred to herein as the &#8220;Fundamental Representations&#8221;. The representations and warranties of the Company set forth in this Agreement and related to Taxes, including those set forth in Section 2.9 (Tax Matters) or in the FIRPTA Certificate delivered pursuant to Section 8.10 are sometimes referred to herein as the &#8220;Tax Representations.&#8221; For the avoidance of doubt, the Parties hereby agree and acknowledge that the survival periods set forth in this Section 10.5(a) and Section 10.5(b) are contractual statutes of limitations and any claim brought by any Party pursuant to this Section 10 must be brought or filed prior to the expiration of the applicable survival period.              (b)   Covenants. The respective covenants, agreements and obligations of the Company, the Buyer, the Stockholders and the Stockholder Representative set forth in this Agreement, in any certificate, document or other instrument delivered by such party pursuant to this Agreement, and the Stockholder Closing Agreements shall survive the execution and delivery of this Agreement, any investigation by or on behalf of any party hereto, and the Closing without limitation and shall survive until the expiration of the applicable statute of limitations, or such earlier time period as specified herein or therein; provided, that such covenants, agreements and obligations which by their terms are to be performed prior to the Closing (&#8220;Pre-Closing Covenants&#8221;) shall not survive the first (1st) anniversary of the Closing Date.              (c)   Basket. No indemnification shall be payable pursuant to Section 10.2(a) (other than with respect to a Fundamental Representation or Tax Representations for which this Section 10.5(c) shall not apply) or a breach of Pre-Closing Covenants unless the total amount of all indemnifiable Losses incurred by the Buyer Indemnitees, including those subject to all previous claims that resulted in Losses for such matters, exceeds $1,250,000 (the &#8220;Basket&#8221;), whereupon indemnification shall be payable for the amount of such Losses only in excess of the Basket.              (d)   Cap; Other Limitations. Subject to the other provisions of this Section 10.5:                    (i)   each Stockholder&#8217;s aggregate liability for all Losses for       indemnification under Section 10.2(a) (other than with respect to a Fundamental       Representation) shall not exceed their respective Pro Rata Escrow Share of the Escrow       Amount and shall be solely satisfied from the Escrow Amount held pursuant to the Escrow       Agreement;                                        73</FONT></DIV>

(f)   Reduction for Insurance. The amount of any Losses that are subject to indemnification under this Section 10 shall be reduced by the amount by which (a) any insurance proceeds actually received by the Indemnified Party relating to such Loss exceeds (b) the amount of reasonable and documented expenses incurred by such Indemnified Party in procuring such insurance recovery, including reasonable legal fees and expenses and any increased premiums or costs as a result of such claim for which insurance proceeds are received. The Indemnified Party shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to recover under insurance policies or indemnity, contribution or other similar agreements for any Losses prior to seeking indemnification under this Agreement.              (g)   Injunction. The exclusive remedy provisions shall not prohibit any Party from seeking any non-monetary equitable remedy, including a preliminary or permanent injunction or specific performance.              (h)   No Subrogation. Following the Closing, no Stockholder shall have any right of indemnification, contribution or subrogation against the Company with respect to any indemnification payment required to be made by such Stockholder under Section 10.2.                                        74</FONT></DIV>

The Stockholder Representative shall be entitled to: (i) rely upon the Allocation Certificate, (ii) rely upon any signature believed by it to be genuine, and (iii) reasonably assume that a signatory has proper authorization to sign on behalf of the applicable Stockholder or other party.

In no event will the Stockholder Representative be required to advance its own funds on behalf of the Stockholders or otherwise. Furthermore, the Stockholder Representative shall not be required to take any action unless the Stockholder Representative has been provided with funds, security or indemnities which, in its determination, are sufficient to protect the Stockholder Representative against the costs, expenses and liabilities which may be incurred by the Stockholder Representative in performing such actions. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, any restrictions or limitations on liability or indemnification obligations of, or provisions limiting the recourse against non-parties otherwise applicable to, the Stockholders set forth elsewhere in this Agreement are not intended to be applicable to the indemnities provided to the Stockholder Representative under this section. The foregoing indemnities and immunities will survive the Closing, the resignation or removal of the Stockholder Representative or the termination of this Agreement or the Escrow Agreement. The Stockholder Representative undertakes to perform such duties and only such duties as are specifically set forth in this Agreement and/or any Ancillary Agreement to which the Stockholder Representative is a party and no implied covenants or obligations shall be read into this Agreement or any Ancillary Agreements against the Stockholder Representative.

The Stockholders will not receive any interest or earnings on the Expense Fund and irrevocably transfer and assign to the Stockholder Representative any ownership right that they may otherwise have had in any such interest or earnings. The Stockholder Representative is not providing any investment supervision, recommendations or advice and will not be liable for any loss of principal of the Expense Fund other than as a result of its gross negligence or willful misconduct. The Stockholder Representative is not acting as a withholding agent or in any similar capacity in connection with the Expense Fund, and has no tax reporting or income distribution obligations. The Stockholder Representative will hold these funds separate from its corporate funds, will not use these funds for its operating expenses or any other corporate purposes and will not voluntarily make these funds available to its creditors in the event of bankruptcy. Subject to Advisory Group approval, the Stockholder Representative may contribute funds to the Expense Fund from any consideration otherwise distributable to the Stockholders. As soon as practicable following the completion of the Stockholder Representative&#8217;s responsibilities, the Stockholder Representative will deliver any remaining balance of the Expense Fund to the Paying Agent for further distribution to the Stockholders. For tax purposes, the Expense Fund will be treated as having been received and voluntarily set aside by the Stockholders at the time of Closing.              (g)   The Stockholder Representative may resign at any time. In the event that the Stockholder Representative resigns from such position or is unable to continue in such position, Stockholders holding among them the rights to receive at least a majority of the amount then remaining in the Escrow Amount to be distributed to the Stockholders (or, if no Escrow Amount remains, representing a majority in interest of the Pro Rata Shares) (the &#8220;Majority Holders&#8221;) shall                                       85</FONT></DIV>

The Stockholder Representative may be removed at any time upon the written consent of the Majority Holders with not less than thirty (30) days&#8217; prior written notice to the Buyer; provided however, that a successor Stockholder Representative must be concurrently appointed and become a party to this Agreement and the Escrow Agreement.
