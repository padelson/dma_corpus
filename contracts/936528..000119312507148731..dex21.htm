the Merger Consideration so that each share of First Mutual Common Stock
issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be
converted into the right to receive solely the Per Share Cash Consideration.

If Washington Federal makes an election pursuant to the proviso set forth
above, it shall give prompt written notice to First Mutual and all references
to "Merger Consideration" in this Agreement shall thereafter be deemed to
refer to the "Merger Consideration" as revised pursuant hereto.

(2) _Additional Definitions_. For purposes of this Agreement:

(i) "Aggregate Merger Consideration" shall mean $180,985,491.

(ii) "Average Share Price" of the Washington Federal Common Stock shall mean

Stock, as reported on Nasdaq (as reported by an authoritative source), for
the 10 trading-day period ending with the close of business on the fifth
Business Day preceding the Effective Time.

(iii) "Maximum Cash Consideration" shall mean the product of the Aggregate
Merger Consideration times .50 (i.e., $90,492,745.50).

3.02 _Election Procedures_.

(a) _Election Form_. An election form, in such form as First Mutual and
Washington Federal shall mutually agree (the "Election Form"), shall be mailed
no later than the date on which the Proxy Statement is mailed to each holder
of record of First Mutual Common Stock as of the record date for the
First Mutual Meeting. Each Election Form shall permit the holder (or in the
case of nominee record holders, the beneficial owner through proper
instructions and documentation), subject to the conditions set forth in
Section 3.01(b)(1), (i) to elect to receive Washington Federal Common Stock
with respect to all of such holders First Mutual Common Stock (a "Stock
Election"), (ii) to elect to receive cash with respect to all of such holders
First Mutual Common Stock (a "Cash Election"), (iii) to elect to receive cash
with respect to some of such holders shares and shares of Washington Federal
Common Stock with respect to such holders remaining shares (a
"Mixed Election") or (iv) to indicate that such holder makes no such election
with respect to such holders shares of First Mutual Common Stock (a "Non-
Election"). Shares of First Mutual Common Stock as to which a Cash Election
has been made (including pursuant to a Mixed Election) are referred to herein
as "Cash Election  



 

10  Shares." Shares of First Mutual Common Stock as to which a Stock Election
has been made (including pursuant to a Mixed Election) are referred to
herein as "Stock Election Shares." Shares of First Mutual Common Stock as to
which no election has been made are referred to herein as "No-Election
Shares." Nominee record holders who hold First Mutual Common Stock on behalf
of multiple beneficial owners shall indicate how many of the shares held by
them are Stock Election Shares, Cash Election Shares and No-Election Shares.
If a shareholder either (i) does not submit a properly completed Election Form
in a timely fashion, (ii) revokes an Election Form prior to the Election
Deadline and does not resubmit a properly completed Election Form prior to the
Election Deadline, or (iii) fails to perfect his, her or its right to dissent
under applicable law, the shares of First Mutual Common Stock held by such
shareholder shall be designated No-Election Shares. Any Dissenting Shares
shall be deemed to be Cash Election Shares and, with respect to such shares,
the holders thereof shall in no event be classified as holders of Reallocated
Stock Shares.

(b) _Election Deadline_. The term "Election Deadline" shall mean 5:00 p.m.,
Pacific Time, on the Business Day on which the First Mutual Meeting is first
convened, or such other date as Washington Federal and First Mutual shall
mutually agree upon.

(c) _Effective Election_. Any election to receive Washington Federal Common
Stock or cash shall have been properly made only if the agent designated by
Washington Federal to act as the exchange agent for purposes of conducting the
election procedure and the exchange procedure described in Sections 3.01 and
3.02 (the "Exchange Agent") shall have actually received a properly
completed Election Form by the Election Deadline. Any Election Form may be
revoked or changed by the person submitting such Election Form to the Exchange
Agent (or any other Person to whom the subject shares of First Mutual Common
Stock are subsequently transferred) by written notice to the Exchange Agent
only if such written notice is actually received by the Exchange Agent at or
prior to the Election Deadline. The Exchange Agent shall have reasonable
discretion to determine when any election, modification or revocation is
received, whether any such election, modification or revocation has been
properly made and to disregard immaterial defects in any Election Form, and
any good faith decisions of the Exchange Agent regarding such matters shall
be binding and conclusive. Neither Washington Federal nor the Exchange Agent
shall be under any obligation to notify any person of any defect in an
Election Form.

(d) _Allocation_. The Exchange Agent shall effect the allocation among holders
of First Mutual Common Stock of rights to receive Washington Federal Common
Stock or cash in the Merger in accordance with the Election Forms as follows:

(i) _Minimum Cash Consideration Undersubscribed_. If the number of Cash
Election Shares times the Per Share Cash Consideration is less than the
Minimum Cash Consideration, then:

(1) all Cash Election Shares (subject to Section 3.06 with respect to
Dissenting Shares) shall be converted into the right to receive cash;

(2) No-Election Shares shall then be deemed to be Cash Election Shares to the
extent necessary to have the total number of Cash Election Shares (including
 



 

11  Dissenting Shares) times the Per Share Cash Consideration equal the Minimum
Cash Consideration. If less than all of the No-Election Shares need to be
treated as Cash Election Shares, then the Exchange Agent shall select which
No-Election Shares shall be treated as Cash Election Shares in such manner as
the Exchange Agent shall determine, and all remaining No-Election Shares shall
thereafter be treated as Stock Election Shares;

(3) if all of the No-Election Shares are treated as Cash Election Shares under
the preceding subsection and the total number of Cash Election Shares times
the Per Share Cash Consideration is less than the Minimum Cash Consideration,
then the Exchange Agent shall convert on a pro rata basis as described below
in Section 3.02(e) a sufficient number of Stock Election Shares into Cash
Election Shares ("Reallocated Cash Shares") such that the sum of the number of
Cash Election Shares plus the number of Reallocated Cash Shares times the Per
Share Cash Consideration equals the Minimum Cash Consideration, and all
Reallocated Cash Shares will be converted into the right to receive cash; and

(4) the Stock Election Shares which are not Reallocated Cash Shares shall be
converted into the right to receive Washington Federal Common Stock.

(ii) _Maximum Cash Consideration Oversubscribed_. If the number of Cash
Election Shares times the Per Share Cash Consideration is greater than the
Maximum Cash Consideration, then:

(1) all Stock Election Shares and all No-Election Shares shall be converted
into the right to receive Washington Federal Common Stock;

(2) the Exchange Agent shall convert on a pro rata basis as described below in
Section 3.02(e) a sufficient number of Cash Election Shares (excluding any
Dissenting Shares) ("Reallocated Stock Shares") such that the number of
remaining Cash Election Shares (including Dissenting Shares) times the Per
Share Cash Consideration equals the Maximum Cash Consideration, and all
Reallocated Stock Shares shall be converted into the right to
receive Washington Federal Common Stock; and

(3) the Cash Election Shares (subject to Section 3.06 with respect to
Dissenting Shares) which are not Reallocated Stock Shares shall be converted
into the right to receive cash.

(iii) _Minimum or Maximum Cash Consideration Satisfied_. If the number of
Cash Election Shares times the Per Share Cash Consideration is equal to the
Minimum Cash Consideration or the Maximum Cash Consideration, then
subparagraphs (d)(i) and (ii) above shall not apply and all Cash Election
Shares (subject to Section 3.06 with respect to Dissenting Shares) shall be
converted into the right to receive cash and all No-Election Shares and all
Stock Election Shares will be converted into the right to receive
Washington Federal Common Stock.

(e) _Pro Rata Reallocations_. In the event that the Exchange Agent is required
pursuant to Section 3.02(d)(i)(3) to convert some Stock Election Shares into
Reallocated Cash Shares, each holder of Stock Election Shares shall be
allocated a pro rata portion of the total Reallocated Cash Shares. In the
event the Exchange Agent is required pursuant to Section 3.02(d)(ii)(2) to
convert some Cash Election Shares into Reallocated Stock Shares, each holder
of Cash Election Shares shall be allocated a pro rata portion of the total
Reallocated Stock Shares.



 

12 (f) _Stock Consideration Adjustment_. Provided that Washington Federal has not
elected to revise the Merger Consideration to reflect an all cash transaction
as contemplated by the proviso in Section 3.01(b)(1), then notwithstanding any
other provision of this Agreement, if at the time of the Closing, the
aggregate value of the shares of Washington Federal Common Stock to be
exchanged for shares of First Mutual Common Stock is less than 40% of the
Aggregate Merger Consideration, then Washington Federal shall direct the
Exchange Agent to convert a minimum number of No-Election Shares and, to the
extent necessary a minimum number of Cash Election Shares, into Stock Election
Shares so that the aggregate value of the shares of Washington Federal Common
Stock exchanged for shares of First Mutual Common Stock constitutes 40% of
the aggregate value of the Aggregate Merger Consideration. For purposes of
this Section 3.02(f) only, the value of a share of Washington Federal Common
Stock will be the value as of the time of the Closing.

3.03 _Exchange Procedures_.

(a)  _Mailing of Transmittal Material_. Provided that First Mutual has
delivered, or caused to be delivered, to the Exchange Agent all information
which is necessary for the Exchange Agent to perform its obligations as
specified herein, the Exchange Agent shall, promptly following the Effective
Date, mail or make available to each holder of record of a Certificate or
Certificates a notice and letter of transmittal (which shall specify that
delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the Certificates
theretofore representing shares of First Mutual Common Stock shall pass, only
upon proper delivery of the Certificates to the Exchange Agent) advising such
holder of the effectiveness of the Merger and the procedure for surrendering
to the Exchange Agent such Certificate or Certificates in exchange for the
consideration set forth in Section 3.01(b) hereof deliverable in respect
thereof pursuant to this Agreement. A letter of transmittal will be
properly completed only if accompanied by Certificates representing all
shares of First Mutual Common Stock covered thereby, subject to the provisions
of paragraph (d) of this Section 3.03.

(b) _Washington Federal Deliveries_. At the Effective Time, for the benefit of
the holders of Certificates, (i) Washington Federal shall deliver to the
Exchange Agent certificates evidencing the number of shares of Washington
Federal Common Stock issuable and (ii) Washington Federal shall deliver, or
cause WFS to deliver, to the Exchange Agent, the cash portion of the
Aggregate Merger Consideration payable pursuant to this Article III in
exchange for Certificates representing outstanding shares of First Mutual
Common Stock. The Exchange Agent shall not be entitled to vote or exercise any
rights of ownership with respect to the shares of Washington Federal Common
Stock held by it from time to time hereunder, except that it shall receive and
hold all dividends or other distributions paid or distributed with respect to
such shares for the account of the persons entitled thereto.

(c) _Exchange Agent Deliveries_. After completion of the allocation referred
to in paragraph (d) of Section 3.02, each holder of an outstanding
Certificate or Certificates who has surrendered such Certificate or
Certificates to the Exchange Agent will, upon acceptance thereof by the
Exchange Agent, be entitled to a certificate or certificates representing
the number  



 

13  of whole shares of Washington Federal Common Stock and/or the amount of cash
into which the aggregate number of shares of First Mutual Common
Stock previously represented by such Certificate or Certificates surrendered
shall have been converted pursuant to this Agreement and, if such holders
shares of First Mutual Common Stock have been converted into Washington
Federal Common Stock, any other distribution theretofore paid with respect to
Washington Federal Common Stock issuable in the Merger, in each case without
interest. The Exchange Agent shall accept such Certificates upon compliance
with such reasonable terms and conditions as the Exchange Agent may impose to
effect an orderly exchange thereof in accordance with normal exchange
practices. Each outstanding Certificate which prior to the Effective Time
represented First Mutual Common Stock and which is not surrendered to the
Exchange Agent in accordance with the procedures provided for herein shall,
except as otherwise herein provided, until duly surrendered to the Exchange
Agent, be deemed to evidence ownership of the number of shares of Washington
Federal Common Stock and/or the right to receive the amount of cash into
which such First Mutual Common Stock shall have been converted. After the
Effective Time, there shall be no further transfer on the records of First
Mutual of Certificates representing shares of First Mutual Common Stock and,
if such Certificates are presented to First Mutual for transfer, they shall be
cancelled against delivery of certificates for Washington Federal Common Stock
and/or cash as hereinabove provided. No dividends which have been declared
will be remitted to any person entitled to receive shares of Washington
Federal Common Stock under Section 3.02 until such person surrenders the
Certificate or Certificates representing First Mutual Common Stock, at
which time such dividends shall be remitted to such person, without interest.

(d) _Lost or Destroyed Certificates; Issuances of Washington Federal Common
Stock in New Names_. The Exchange Agent and Washington Federal, as the case
may be, shall not be obligated to deliver cash and/or a certificate or
certificates representing shares of Washington Federal Common Stock to which
a holder of First Mutual Common Stock would otherwise be entitled as a result
of the Merger until such holder surrenders the Certificate or Certificates
representing the shares of First Mutual Common Stock for exchange as provided
in this Section 3.03, or, in default thereof, an appropriate affidavit of
loss and indemnity agreement and/or a bond in an amount as may be reasonably
required in each case by Washington Federal. If any certificates evidencing
shares of Washington Federal Common Stock are to be issued in a name other
than that in which the Certificate evidencing First Mutual Common Stock
surrendered in exchange therefore is registered, it shall be a condition of
the issuance thereof that the Certificate so surrendered shall be properly
endorsed or accompanied by an executed form of assignment separate from the
Certificate and otherwise in proper form for transfer and that the person
requesting such exchange pay to the Exchange Agent any transfer or other tax
required by reason of the issuance of a certificate for shares of Washington
Federal Common Stock in any name other than that of the registered holder of
the Certificate surrendered or otherwise establish to the satisfaction of
the Exchange Agent that such tax has been paid or is not payable.

(e) _Unclaimed Merger Consideration_. Any portion of the shares of Washington
Federal Common Stock and cash delivered to the Exchange Agent by Washington
Federal pursuant to Section 3.03(b) that remains unclaimed by the stockholders
of First Mutual for six months after the Effective Time (as well as
any proceeds from any investment thereof) shall be delivered by the Exchange
Agent to Washington Federal. Any stockholders of First Mutual who have not
theretofore complied with Section 3.03(c) shall thereafter look only to
Washington Federal for the consideration deliverable in respect of each share
of First Mutual  



 

14  Common Stock such stockholder holds as determined pursuant to this Agreement
without any interest thereon. If outstanding Certificates for shares of
First Mutual Common Stock are not surrendered or the payment for them is not
claimed prior to the date on which such shares of Washington Federal Common
Stock or cash would otherwise escheat to or become the property of any
governmental unit or agency, the unclaimed items shall, to the extent
permitted by abandoned property and any other applicable law, become the
property of Washington Federal (and to the extent not in its possession shall
be delivered to it), free and clear of all claims or interest of any person
previously entitled to such property. Neither the Exchange Agent nor any party
to this Agreement shall be liable to any holder of stock represented by any
Certificate for any consideration paid to a public official pursuant
to applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar laws. Washington Federal
and the Exchange Agent shall be entitled to rely upon the stock transfer books
of First Mutual to establish the identity of those persons entitled to receive
the consideration specified in this Agreement, which books shall be
conclusive with respect thereto. In the event of a dispute with respect to
ownership of stock represented by any Certificate, Washington Federal and the
Exchange Agent shall be entitled to deposit any consideration represented
thereby in escrow with an independent third party and thereafter be relieved
with respect to any claims thereto.

(f) _Affiliate Agreements_. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the
contrary, Certificates surrendered for exchange by any First Mutual Affiliate
shall not be exchanged for certificates representing shares of Washington
Federal Common Stock to which such First Mutual Affiliate may be entitled
pursuant to the terms of this Agreement until Washington Federal has received
a written agreement from such person as specified in Section 6.07. 

3.04 _Rights as Shareholders; Stock Transfers_. At the Effective Time, holders
of First Mutual Common Stock shall cease to be, and shall have no rights as,
stockholders of First Mutual other than to receive the consideration provided
under this Article III. After the Effective Time, there shall be no transfers
on the stock transfer books of First Mutual or the Surviving Corporation of
shares of First Mutual Common Stock.

3.05 _No Fractional Shares_. Notwithstanding any other provision of
this Agreement, neither certificates nor scrip for fractional shares of
Washington Federal Common Stock shall be issued in the Merger. Each holder of
First Mutual Common Stock who otherwise would have been entitled to a fraction
of a share of Washington Federal Common Stock (after taking into account all
Certificates delivered by such holder) shall receive in lieu thereof cash
(without interest) in an amount determined by multiplying the fractional share
interest to which such holder would otherwise be entitled by the Average
Share Price of the Washington Federal Common Stock, rounded to the nearest
whole cent. No such holder shall be entitled to dividends, voting rights or
any other rights in respect of any fractional share. 

3.06 _Dissenting Shares_. Each outstanding share of First Mutual Common Stock
the holder of which has perfected his right to dissent under the WBCA and has
not effectively withdrawn or lost such right as of the Effective Time (the
"Dissenting Shares") shall not be converted into or represent a right to
receive shares of Washington Federal Common Stock or cash hereunder, and the
holder thereof shall be entitled only to such rights as are granted by the
WBCA. First Mutual shall give Washington Federal prompt notice upon receipt by
First Mutual  



 

15  of any such written demands for payment of the fair value of such shares of
First Mutual Common Stock and of withdrawals of such demands and any
other instruments provided pursuant to the WBCA. If any holder of Dissenting
Shares shall fail to perfect or shall have effectively withdrawn or lost the
right to dissent at or prior to the Effective Time and shall have delivered a
properly completed Election Form to the Exchange Agent by the Election
Deadline, the Dissenting Shares held by such holder shall be converted into a
right to receive Washington Federal Common Stock or cash in accordance with
the applicable provisions of this Agreement; and if any such holder of
Dissenting Shares shall not have delivered a properly completed Election Form
to the Exchange Agent by the Election Deadline, the Dissenting Shares held by
such holder shall be designated No-Election Shares. If any holder of
Dissenting Shares shall have effectively withdrawn or lost the right to
dissent (through failure to perfect or otherwise) after the Effective Time,
the Dissenting Shares held by such holder shall be converted on a share by
share basis into either the right to receive Washington Federal Common Stock
and/or cash in accordance with the applicable provisions of this Agreement as
Washington Federal or the Exchange Agent shall determine. Any payments made in
respect of Dissenting Shares shall be made by Washington Federal.

3.07 _Anti-Dilution Provisions_. If, between the date hereof and the Effective
Time, the shares of Washington Federal Common Stock shall be changed into a
different number or class of shares by reason of any reclassification,
recapitalization, split-up, combination, exchange of shares or readjustment,
or a stock dividend thereon shall be declared with a record date within said
period, the Exchange Ratio shall be adjusted accordingly.

3.08 _Withholding Rights_. Washington Federal (through the Exchange Agent, if
applicable) shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from any amounts
otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement to any holder of shares of First
Mutual Common Stock such amounts as Washington Federal is required under the
Code or any state, local or foreign Tax law or regulation thereunder to deduct
and withhold with respect to the making of such payment. Any amounts so
withheld shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been
paid to the holder of First Mutual Common Stock in respect of which such
deduction and withholding was made by Washington Federal.

3.09 _First Mutual Options_. At the Effective Time, each First Mutual Option
which is outstanding, vested and unexercised immediately prior to the
Effective Time, shall be canceled in exchange for the right to receive a
single lump sum cash payment, equal to the product of (i) the number of
shares of First Mutual Common Stock subject to such First Mutual Option
immediately prior to the Effective Time, and (ii) the excess, if any, of the
Per Share Cash Consideration over the exercise price per share of such First
Mutual Option (the "Option Merger Consideration") less any applicable Taxes
required to be withheld with respect to such payment. If the exercise price
per share of any such First Mutual Option is equal to or greater than the Per
Share Cash Consideration, such First Mutual Option shall be canceled without
any cash payment being made in respect thereof. First Mutual shall use its
reasonable best efforts to obtain the written acknowledgment of each holder
of a then-outstanding First Mutual Option with regard to the cancellation of
such First Mutual Option and the payment therefor in accordance with the terms
of this Agreement. Subject to the foregoing, the First Mutual Stock Option
Plans and all First Mutual Options issued thereunder shall terminate at the
Effective Time.



 

16 3.10 _Bank Merger_. As soon as practicable after the execution of this
Agreement, or on such later date as Washington Federal shall specify,
Washington Federal and First Mutual shall cause WFS and FMB to enter into the
Bank Merger Agreement, which provides for the merger of FMB with and into WFS
(the "Bank Merger"), in accordance with applicable laws and regulations and
the terms of the Bank Merger Agreement and as soon as practicable after
consummation of the Merger (or on such later date as Washington Federal shall
specify). The Bank Merger Agreement provides that the directors of WFS upon
consummation of the Bank Merger, together with an existing director of First
Mutual who shall be acceptable to Washington Federal, shall be the directors
of WFS upon consummation of the Bank Merger.

REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES

5.01 _Disclosure Schedules_. On or prior to the date hereof, Washington
Federal has delivered to First Mutual a schedule and First Mutual
has delivered to Washington Federal a schedule (each respectively, its
"Disclosure Schedule") setting forth, among other things, items the disclosure
of which is necessary or appropriate either in response to an express
disclosure requirement contained in a provision hereof or as an exception to
one or more representations or warranties contained in Section 5.03 or 5.04 or
to one or more of its covenants contained in Article IV; provided, however,
that the mere inclusion of an item in a Disclosure Schedule as an exception
to a representation or warranty shall not be deemed an admission by a party
that such item represents a material exception or fact, event or circumstance
or that, absent such inclusion in the Disclosure Schedule, such item is or
would be reasonably likely to result in a Material Adverse Effect.

5.02 _Standard_. Solely for the purposes of determining whether the
conditions set forth in Sections 7.02(a) or 7.03(a), as the case may be, have
been satisfied (and without otherwise qualifying any representation or
warranty made on the date hereof), no representation or warranty of
First Mutual on the one hand or Washington Federal on the other hand
contained in Sections 5.03 or 5.04, respectively, shall be deemed untrue or
incorrect for purposes of Sections 7.02(a) or 7.03(a), and no party hereto
shall be deemed to have breached a representation or warranty for purposes of
such Sections, as a consequence of the existence of any fact, event or
circumstance unless such fact, circumstance or event, individually or taken
together with all other facts, events or circumstances inconsistent with any
representation or warranty contained in Section 5.03 or 5.04, has had or is
reasonably likely to have a Material Adverse Effect on the party making such

memorandum of understanding, commitment letter, supervisory letter or similar
submission.

Subsidiaries to engage in any line of business in any geographic area (or

consummation of the Transaction) or which requires exclusive referrals of
business or requires First Mutual or any of its Subsidiaries to offer
specified products or services to their customers or depositors on a priority
or exclusive basis, or (M) which is with respect to, or otherwise commits

Subsidiaries that would give rise to any valid claim against any party hereto
for a brokerage commission, finders fee or other like payment with respect to

financial statements and opinions required by Section 103(e)(3) of ERISA with
respect to each Benefit Plan; (C) for each Benefit Plan which is a "top-hat"
plan, a copy of filings with the DOL; (D) the most recent determination
letter issued by the IRS for each Benefit Plan that is intended to be
"qualified" under Section 401(a) of the Code; (E) the most recent summary plan
description and any summary of material modifications, as required, for each
Benefit Plan; (F) the most recent actuarial report, if any relating to each
Benefit Plan; (G) the most recent actuarial valuation, study or estimate of
any retiree medical and life insurance benefits plan or supplemental
retirement benefits plan; and (H) the most recent summary annual report for
each Benefit Plan required to provide summary annual reports by Section 104 of
ERISA, have been provided or made available to Washington Federal. 

(ii) Each Benefit Plan has been established and administered to date in all
material respects in accordance with the applicable provisions of ERISA, the
Code and applicable law and with the terms and provisions of all documents,
contracts or agreements pursuant to which such Benefit Plan is maintained.
Each Benefit Plan which is an "employee pension benefit plan" within the
meaning of Section 3(2) of ERISA (a "Pension Plan") and which is intended to
be qualified under Section 401(a) of the Code, has received a favorable
determination letter from the IRS, and First Mutual is not aware of any
circumstances likely to result in revocation of any such favorable
determination letter or the loss of the qualification of such Pension Plan
under Section 401(a) of the Code. Except as Previously Disclosed, neither
First Mutual nor any of its Subsidiaries has received any correspondence or
written or verbal notice from the IRS, DOL, any other governmental agency, any
participant in or beneficiary of, a Benefit Plan, or any agent representing
any of the foregoing that brings into question the qualification of any such
Benefit Plan. There is no material pending or, to First Mutuals knowledge,
threatened litigation relating to the Benefit Plans. Neither First Mutual nor
any of its Subsidiaries has engaged in a transaction with respect to any
Benefit Plan or Pension Plan that could subject First Mutual or any of its
Subsidiaries to a tax or penalty imposed by either Section 4975 of the Code or
Section 502(i) of ERISA in an amount which would be material. There are no
matters pending before the IRS, DOL or other governmental agency with respect
to any Benefit Plan. No Benefit Plan or related trust has been the subject of
an audit, investigation or examination by a Governmental Authority. 

(iii) No liability under Title IV of ERISA has been or is expected to be
incurred by First Mutual or any of its Subsidiaries with respect to any
ongoing, frozen or terminated "single-employer plan," within the meaning of
Section 4001(a)(15) of ERISA, currently or formerly maintained by any of them
or the single-employer plan of any entity which is considered one employer
with First Mutual under Section 4001 of ERISA or Section 414 of the Code (an
"ERISA Affiliate"). Neither First Mutual nor any of its Subsidiaries has
incurred, and neither expects to incur, any withdrawal liability with respect
to a multiemployer plan (as defined in 4001(a)(3) of ERISA) under of Title IV
of ERISA (regardless of whether based on contributions of an ERISA Affiliate).
No notice of a "reportable event," within the meaning of Section 4043 of
ERISA for which the 30-day reporting requirement has not been waived, has been
required to be filed for any Pension Plan or by any ERISA Affiliate or will be
required to be filed in connection with the Transaction. There has been no
termination or partial termination, as defined in Section 411(d) of the Code
and the regulations thereunder, of any Pension Plan.



 

30 (iv) All contributions required to be made under the terms of any Benefit Plan
have been timely made or have been reflected on the financial statements of
First Mutual included in First Mutuals Securities Documents. Neither any
Pension Plan nor any single-employer plan of an ERISA Affiliate has an
"accumulated funding deficiency" (whether or not waived) within the meaning
of Section 412 of the Code or Section 302 of ERISA and no ERISA Affiliate has
an outstanding funding waiver. Neither First Mutual nor any of its
Subsidiaries has provided, or is required to provide, security to any Pension
Plan or to any single-employer plan of an ERISA Affiliate pursuant to Section
401(a)(29) of the Code.

(v) Neither First Mutual nor any of its Subsidiaries has any obligations for
retiree health and life benefits under any Benefit Plan, other than coverage
as may be required under Section 4980B of the Code or Part 6 of Title I of
ERISA, or under the continuation of coverage provisions of the laws of any
state or locality. First Mutual or any of its Subsidiaries may amend or
terminate any such Benefit Plan in accordance with and to the extent permitted
by their terms at any time without incurring any liability thereunder. No
event or condition exists with respect to a Benefit Plan that could subject
First Mutual to a material tax under Section 4980B of the Code.

(vi) None of the execution of this Agreement, shareholder approval of this
Agreement or consummation of the Transaction, either along or in
connection with a subsequent event, will, except as Previously Disclosed, (A)
entitle any Employees or any current or former director or independent
contractor of First Mutual or any of its Subsidiaries to severance pay or any
increase in severance pay upon any termination of employment after the date
hereof, (B) accelerate the time of payment or vesting or trigger any payment
or funding (through a grantor trust or otherwise) of compensation or benefits
under, increase the amount payable or trigger any other material obligation
pursuant to, any of the Benefit Plans, (C) result in any breach or violation
of, or a default under, any of the Benefit Plans or (D) result in any payment
that would be a "parachute payment" to a "disqualified individual" as those
terms are defined in Section 280G of the Code, without regard to whether such
payment is reasonable compensation for personal services performed or to be
performed in the future.

(vii) All required reports and descriptions (including but not limited to Form
5500 annual reports and required attachments, Forms 1099-R, summary annual
reports, Forms PBGC-1 and summary plan descriptions) have been filed or
distributed appropriately with respect to each Benefit Plan. All required tax
filings with respect to each Benefit Plan have been made, and any taxes due in
connection with such filings have been paid.

(viii) Section 5.03(m)(viii) of First Mutuals Disclosure Schedule sets forth
the following: (A) the maximum amount of all payments and benefits to which
each individual set forth on such schedule is entitled to receive, pursuant to
all employment, salary continuation, bonus, change in control, and all other
agreements, plans and arrangements, in connection with a termination of
employment before or following, or otherwise in connection with or contingent
upon, the transactions contemplated under this Agreement (each such total
amount in respect of each such individual, the "Change in Control Benefit"),
other than the payment any such individual shall otherwise be entitled to
receive as a gross-up payment in respect of any excise tax imposed on the
individual pursuant to Section 4999 of the Code as calculated pursuant to the
applicable agreement (each such payment, a "Gross-Up Payment"); (B) the amount
of any Gross-Up Payment payable to each such individual; and (C) the maximum
aggregate amount of all Change in Control Benefits and Gross-Up Payments.



 

31 (ix) No Benefit Plan is or has been funded by, associated with, or related to
a "voluntary employees beneficiary association" within the meaning of
Section 501(c)(9) of the Code, a "welfare benefit fund" within the meaning of
Section 419 of the Code, a "qualified asset account" within the meaning of
Section 419A of the Code or a "multiple employer welfare arrangement" within
the meaning of Section 3(40) of ERISA.

(x) Each Benefit Plan which is a "nonqualified deferred compensation plan"
(within the meaning of Section 409A of the Code) has been operated in
compliance with Section 409A of the Code and the guidance issued by the
IRS with respect to such plans.

(n) _Labor Matters_. Neither First Mutual nor any of its Subsidiaries is a
party to and is bound by any collective bargaining agreement, contract or
other agreement or understanding with a labor union or labor organization, nor
is First Mutual or any of its Subsidiaries the subject of a proceeding
asserting that it has committed an unfair labor practice (within the meaning
of the National Labor Relations Act) or seeking to compel First Mutual or any
of its Subsidiaries to bargain with any labor organization as to wages or
conditions of employment, nor is there any strike or other labor dispute
involving it or any of its Subsidiaries pending or, to First Mutuals
knowledge, threatened, nor is First Mutual or any of its Subsidiaries aware of
any activity involving its employees seeking to certify a collective
bargaining unit or engaging in other organizational activity. Each of First
Mutual and its Subsidiaries has paid in full all wages, salaries, commissions,
bonuses, benefits and other compensation currently due to its employees or
otherwise arising on a current basis under any policy, practice, agreement,
plan, program, statute or other law.

(o) _Environmental Matters_. Except as Previously Disclosed, there are no
legal, administrative, arbitral or other proceedings, claims, actions, causes
of action, private environmental investigations, remediation activities or
governmental investigations of any nature seeking to impose, or
that reasonably could be expected to result in the imposition, on First
Mutual or any of its Subsidiaries of any liability or obligation arising under
any Environmental Laws pending or, to the knowledge of First Mutual,
threatened against First Mutual or any of its Subsidiaries, which liability
or obligation could have or could reasonably be expected to have, individually
or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on First Mutual or its
Subsidiaries taken as a whole. To the knowledge of First Mutual, there is no
reasonable basis for any such proceeding, claim, action, environmental
remediation or investigation that could impose any liability or obligation
that could have or could reasonably be expected to have, individually or in
the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on First Mutual or its Subsidiaries
taken as a whole. First Mutual and its Subsidiaries are in compliance in all
material respects with applicable Environmental Laws. To First Mutuals
knowledge, no real property (including buildings or other structures)
currently or formerly owned or operated by First Mutual or any of its
Subsidiaries, or any property in which First Mutual or any of its Subsidiaries
has held a security interest, Lien or a fiduciary or management role ("First
Mutual Loan Property"), has been contaminated with, or has had any release of,
any Hazardous Substance that has resulted, or would reasonably be expected to
result, in a Material Adverse Effect with respect to First Mutual. Neither
First Mutual nor any of its Subsidiaries could be deemed the owner or operator
 



 

32  of, nor has it participated in the management regarding Hazardous Substances
of, any First Mutual Loan Property which has been contaminated with, or has
had any release of, any Hazardous Substance that has resulted, or would
reasonably be expected to result, in a Material Adverse Effect with respect to
First Mutual. Neither First Mutual nor any of its Subsidiaries has any
liability for any Hazardous Substance disposal or contamination on any third
party property. Neither First Mutual nor any of its Subsidiaries nor, to First
Mutuals knowledge, any Person whose liability First Mutual or any of its
Subsidiaries has assumed whether contractually or by operation of law, has
received any notice, demand letter, claim or request for information alleging
any material violation of, or material liability under, any Environmental Law.
Neither First Mutual nor any of its Subsidiaries is subject to any order,
decree, injunction or other agreement with any Governmental Authority or any
third party relating to any Environmental Law. To First Mutuals knowledge,
there are no circumstances or conditions (including the presence of asbestos,
underground storage tanks, lead products, polychlorinated biphenyls, prior
manufacturing operations, dry-cleaning, or automotive services) involving
First Mutual or any of its Subsidiaries, any currently or formerly owned or
operated property, any First Mutual Loan Property, or, to First Mutuals
knowledge, any Person whose liability First Mutual or any of its Subsidiaries
has assumed whether contractually or by operation of law, that could
reasonably be expected to result in any material claims, liability or
investigations against First Mutual or any of its Subsidiaries, result in any
material restrictions on the ownership, use, or transfer of any property
pursuant to any Environmental Law, or adversely affect the value of any First
Mutual Loan Property. First Mutual has Previously Disclosed and made available
to Washington Federal copies of all environmental reports or studies, sampling
data, correspondence and filings in its possession or reasonably available to
it relating to First Mutual, its Subsidiaries and any currently or formerly
owned or operated property.

corporate action of Washington Federal, the Washington Federal Board, WFS and
the WFS Board. This Agreement has been duly executed and delivered by

condition, restriction or requirement of the type described in Section
7.01(b).

(ii) Subject to receipt, or the making, of the consents, approvals, waivers
and filings referred to in the preceding paragraph and expiration of
the related waiting periods, the execution, delivery and performance of this
Agreement by Washington Federal, the Bank Merger Agreement by WFS and the
consummation of the Transaction do not and will not (A) constitute a breach or
violation of, or a default under, or give rise to any Lien, any acceleration
of remedies or any right of termination under, any law, code, ordinance, rule
or regulation or any judgment, decree, injunction, order, governmental permit
or license, or agreement, indenture or instrument of Washington Federal or of
any of its Subsidiaries or to which Washington Federal or any of its
Subsidiaries or any of their respective properties is subject or bound, (B)
constitute a breach or violation of, or a default under, the articles of
incorporation or bylaws (or similar governing documents) of Washington Federal

filed (collectively, Washington Federals "Securities Documents") with the
SEC, as of the date filed or to be filed, (A) complied or will comply in all
material respects as to form with the applicable requirements under the
Securities Act or the Exchange Act, as the case may be and (B) did not and
will not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a
material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the
statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were
made, not misleading, except that information as of a later date shall be
deemed to modify information as of an earlier date; and each of the
consolidated balance sheets contained in or incorporated by reference into
any such Securities Documents (including the related notes and schedules
thereto) fairly presents, or will fairly present, the consolidated financial
position of Washington Federal and its Subsidiaries as of its date, and each
of the consolidated statements of income and changes in stockholders equity
and cash flows or equivalent statements in such Securities Documents
(including any related notes and schedules thereto) fairly presents, or will
fairly present, the consolidated results of operations, changes in
stockholders equity and cash flows, as the case may be, of Washington Federal
and its Subsidiaries for the periods to which they relate, in each case in
accordance with GAAP consistently applied during the periods involved, except
in each case as may be noted therein.

(ii) Since March 31, 2007, no event has occurred or circumstance arisen that,
individually or taken together with all other facts, circumstances and events
(described in any paragraph of this Section 5.04 or otherwise), is reasonably
likely to have a Material Adverse Effect with respect to Washington Federal.

(h) _Legal Proceedings_. No litigation, arbitration, claim or other proceeding
before any court or governmental agency is pending against Washington Federal
or its Subsidiaries and, to Washington Federals knowledge, no such
litigation, arbitration, claim or other proceeding has been threatened and
there are no facts which could reasonably give rise to such litigation,
arbitration, claim or other proceeding. Neither Washington Federal nor any of

subject to any order, judgment, decree or regulatory restrictions
that, individually or in the aggregate, has or could reasonably be expected
to have a Material Adverse Effect with respect to Washington Federal.

Subsidiaries that would give rise to any valid claim against any party hereto
for a brokerage commission, finders fee or other like payment with respect
to the Transaction.

(j) _Tax Matters_. Subject to Washington Federals right under certain
circumstances specified herein to revise the Merger Consideration to reflect
an all cash transaction, as of the date hereof, Washington Federal does not
have any reason to believe that any conditions exist that might prevent or
impede the Merger from qualifying as a reorganization within the meaning of
Section 368(a) of the Code.

similar arrangement with, or a commitment letter or similar submission to,

understanding, commitment letter, supervisory letter or similar submission.

(l) _Compliance With Laws_. Each of Washington Federal and its Subsidiaries:

(i) is in material compliance with all applicable federal, state, local and
foreign statutes, laws, codes, regulations, ordinances, rules, judgments,
injunctions, orders, decrees or policies and/or guidelines of a Governmental
Authority applicable thereto or to the employees conducting such businesses,
including, without limitation, Section 23A and 23B of the Federal Reserve Act

not in compliance with any of the statutes, regulations or ordinances which
such Governmental Authority enforces or (B) threatening to revoke any license,
franchise, permit or governmental authorization (nor, to Washington Federals
knowledge, do any grounds for any of the foregoing exist).

(m) _Ownership of First Mutual Common Stock_. None of Washington Federal or
any of its Subsidiaries, or to Washington Federals knowledge, any of its
other affiliates or associates (as such terms are defined under the Exchange
Act), owns beneficially or of record,  



 

42  directly or indirectly, or is a party to any agreement, arrangement or
understanding for the purpose of acquiring, holding, voting or disposing of,
shares of First Mutual (other than shares held in a fiduciary capacity that
are beneficially owned by third parties or as a result of debts previously
contracted).

ARTICLE VI

COVENANTS

6.01 _Reasonable Best Efforts_. Subject to the terms and conditions of this
Agreement, each of First Mutual and Washington Federal agrees to use its
reasonable best efforts in good faith, and to cause its Subsidiaries to use
their reasonable best efforts in good faith, to take, or cause to be taken,
all actions, and to do, or cause to be done, all things necessary, proper or
desirable, or advisable under applicable laws, so as to permit consummation of
the Transaction as promptly as practicable and otherwise to enable
consummation of the Transaction, including the satisfaction of the conditions
set forth in Article VII hereof, and shall cooperate fully with the other
party hereto to that end.

6.02 _Shareholder Approval_.

(a) First Mutual agrees to take, in accordance with applicable law and the
First Mutual Articles and the First Mutual Bylaws, all action necessary to
convene as soon as reasonably practicable a special meeting of its
stockholders to consider and vote upon the approval of this Agreement and any
other matters required to be approved by First Mutuals stockholders for
consummation of the Transaction (including any adjournment or postponement,
the "First Mutual Meeting"). Except with the prior approval of Washington
Federal, no other matters shall be submitted for the approval of the First
Mutual stockholders at the First Mutual Meeting. Subject to Section 6.02(b),
the First Mutual Board shall at all times prior to and during such meeting
recommend such approval and shall take all reasonable lawful action to solicit
such approval by its stockholders and shall not (x) withdraw, modify or
qualify in any manner adverse to Washington Federal such recommendation
or (y) take any other action or make any other public statement in connection
with the First Mutual Meeting inconsistent with such recommendation
(collectively, a "Change in Recommendation"), except as and to the extent
permitted by Section 6.02(b). Notwithstanding any Change in Recommendation,
this Agreement shall be submitted to the stockholders of First Mutual at the
First Mutual Meeting for the purpose of approving the Agreement and any other
matters required to be approved by First Mutuals stockholders for
consummation of the Transaction. In addition to the foregoing, First Mutual
shall not submit to the vote of its stockholders any Acquisition Proposal
other than the Merger.



 

43 (b) Notwithstanding the foregoing, First Mutual and the First Mutual Board
shall be permitted to effect a Change in Recommendation if and only to the
extent that:

(i) First Mutual shall have complied in all material respects with Section
6.08;

(ii) the First Mutual Board, based on advice of its outside counsel, shall
have determined in good faith that failure to do so would result in a
violation of its fiduciary duties under applicable law; and

(iii) if the First Mutual Board intends to effect a Change in Recommendation
following an Acquisition Proposal, (A) the First Mutual Board shall have
concluded in good faith, after giving effect to all of the adjustments which
may be offered by Washington Federal pursuant to clause (C) below, that such
Acquisition Proposal constitutes a Superior Proposal, (B) First Mutual shall
notify Washington Federal, at least five Business Days in advance, of its
intention to effect a Change in Recommendation in response to such Superior
Proposal (including the identity of the party making such Acquisition
Proposal) and furnish to Washington Federal a copy of the relevant proposed
transaction agreements with the party making such Superior Proposal and all
other material documents, and (C) prior to effecting such a Change in
Recommendation, First Mutual shall, and shall cause its financial and legal
advisors to, during the period following First Mutuals delivery of the notice
referred to in clause (B) above, negotiate with Washington Federal in good
faith for a period of up to five Business Days (to the extent Washington
Federal desires to negotiate) to make such adjustments in the terms and
conditions of this Agreement so that such Acquisition Proposal ceases to
constitute a Superior Proposal.

6.03 _Registration Statement_.

(a) Washington Federal agrees to prepare a registration statement on Form S-4
or other applicable form (the "Registration Statement") to be filed by
Washington Federal with the SEC in connection with the issuance of Washington
Federal Common Stock in the Merger (including the proxy statement and
prospectus and other proxy solicitation materials of First Mutual constituting
a part thereof (the "Proxy Statement") and all related documents). First
Mutual shall prepare and furnish such information relating to it and its
directors, officers and stockholders as may be reasonably required in
connection with the above referenced documents based on its knowledge of and
access to the information required for said documents, and First Mutual, and
its legal, financial and accounting advisors, shall have the right to review
in advance such Registration Statement prior to its filing. First Mutual
agrees to cooperate with Washington Federal and Washington Federals counsel
and accountants in requesting and obtaining appropriate opinions, consents and
letters from its financial advisor and independent auditor in connection with
the Registration Statement and the Proxy Statement. Provided that First Mutual
has cooperated as described above, Washington Federal agrees to file, or cause
to be filed, the Registration Statement and the Proxy Statement with the SEC
as promptly as reasonably practicable. Each of First Mutual and Washington
Federal agrees to use its reasonable best  



 

44  efforts to cause the Registration Statement to be declared effective under
the Securities Act as promptly as reasonably practicable after the filing
thereof. Washington Federal also agrees to use its reasonable best efforts to
obtain all necessary state securities law or "Blue Sky" permits and approvals
required to carry out the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. After
the Registration Statement is declared effective under the Securities Act,
First Mutual shall promptly mail at its expense the Proxy Statement to its
stockholders.

(b) Each of First Mutual and Washington Federal agrees that none of the
information supplied or to be supplied by it for inclusion or incorporation by
reference in (i) the Registration Statement shall, at the time the
Registration Statement and each amendment or supplement thereto, if any,
becomes effective under the Securities Act, contain any untrue statement of a
material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein
or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading and (ii) the Proxy
Statement and any amendment or supplement thereto shall, at the date(s) of
mailing to stockholders and at the time of the First Mutual Meeting, contain
any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact
required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not
misleading. Each of First Mutual and Washington Federal further agrees that if
such party shall become aware prior to the Effective Date of any information
furnished by such party that would cause any of the statements in the
Registration Statement or the Proxy Statement to be false or misleading with
respect to any material fact, or to omit to state any material fact necessary
to make the statements therein not false or misleading, to promptly inform the
other parties thereof and to take the necessary steps to correct the
Registration Statement or the Proxy Statement.

(c) Washington Federal agrees to advise First Mutual, promptly after
Washington Federal receives notice thereof, of the time when the
Registration Statement has become effective or any supplement or amendment
has been filed, of the issuance of any stop order or the suspension of the
qualification of Washington Federal Common Stock for offering or sale in any
jurisdiction, of the initiation or, to the extent Washington Federal is aware
thereof, threat of any proceeding for any such purpose, or of any request by
the SEC for the amendment or supplement of the Registration Statement or for
additional information.

6.04 _Regulatory Filings_.

(a) Each of Washington Federal and First Mutual and their respective
Subsidiaries shall cooperate and use their respective reasonable best efforts
to prepare all documentation, to effect all filings and to obtain all permits,
consents, approvals and authorizations of all third parties and Governmental
Authorities necessary to consummate the Transaction; and any initial filings
with Governmental Authorities shall be made by Washington Federal as soon as
reasonably practicable after the execution hereof. Each of Washington Federal
and First Mutual shall have the right to review in advance, and to the extent
practicable each shall consult with the other, in each case subject to
applicable laws relating to the exchange of information, with respect to all
written information submitted to any third party or any Governmental Authority
in connection with the Transaction. In exercising the foregoing right, each of
such parties agrees to act reasonably and as promptly as practicable.
Each party hereto agrees that it shall consult with the other parties hereto
with respect to the obtaining of all permits, consents, approvals, waivers and
authorizations of all third parties and Governmental Authorities necessary or
advisable to consummate the Transaction, and each party shall keep the other
parties apprised of the status of material matters relating to completion of
the Transaction.



 

45 (b) Each party agrees, upon request, to furnish the other parties with all
information concerning itself, its Subsidiaries, directors, officers and
stockholders and such other matters as may be reasonably necessary or
advisable in connection with any filing, notice or application made by or on
behalf of such other parties or any of their Subsidiaries to any third party
or Governmental Authority.

6.05 _Press Releases_. First Mutual and Washington Federal shall consult with
each other before issuing any press release with respect to the Transaction
or this Agreement and shall not issue any such press release or make any such
public statements without the prior consent of the other party, which shall
not be unreasonably withheld; provided, however, that a party may, without
the prior consent of the other party (but after such consultation, to the
extent practicable under the circumstances), issue such press release or make
such public statements as may upon the advice of outside counsel be required
by law or the rules or regulations of the SEC or Nasdaq. First Mutual and
Washington Federal shall cooperate to develop all public announcement
materials and make appropriate management available at presentations
related to the Transaction as reasonably requested by the other party.

6.06 _Access; Information_.

(a) First Mutual agrees that upon reasonable notice and subject to applicable
laws relating to the exchange of information, it shall afford

accountants and other authorized representatives such access during normal
business hours throughout the period prior to the Effective Time to the books,
records (including, without limitation, Tax Returns and work papers of
independent auditors), systems, properties, personnel and advisors of First
Mutual and to such other information relating to First Mutual as Washington
Federal may reasonably request and, during such period, it shall furnish
promptly to Washington Federal (i) a copy of each report, schedule,
registration statement and other document filed or received during such period
pursuant to the requirements of federal or state securities laws and federal
or state banking, lending, consumer finance or privacy laws and (ii) all other
information concerning the business, properties and personnel of First Mutual
as Washington Federal may reasonably request.

(b) During the period from the date of this Agreement to the Effective Time,
First Mutual shall, upon the request of Washington Federal, cause one or more
of its designated representatives to confer on a monthly or more frequent
basis with representatives of Washington Federal regarding its financial
condition, operations and business and matters relating to the completion of
the Transaction. As soon as reasonably available, but in no event more than
40 days after the end of each calendar quarter ending after the date of this
Agreement (other than the last quarter of each fiscal year ending December
31), First Mutual will deliver to Washington Federal its consolidated
statement of financial condition and consolidated statements of income,
changes in stockholders equity and cash flows, without related notes, for
such quarter prepared in accordance with GAAP and, as soon as reasonably
available, but in no event more than 75 days after the end of each fiscal
year, First Mutual will deliver to Washington Federal its consolidated
statement of financial condition and consolidated statements of income,  



 

46  changes in stockholders equity and cash flows for such year prepared in
accordance with GAAP. Within 15 days after the end of each month, First
Mutual will deliver to Washington Federal a consolidated statement of
financial condition and consolidated statement of income, without related
notes, for such month prepared in accordance with GAAP.

(c) All information furnished pursuant to this Section 6.06 shall be subject
to the provisions of the Confidentiality Agreement, dated as of May 29, 2007
between Washington Federal and Keefe, Bruyette and Woods, Inc. on behalf of
First Mutual (the "Confidentiality Agreement").

(d) No investigation by any of the parties or their respective representatives
shall affect the representations, warranties, covenants or agreements of the
other parties set forth herein.

(e) First Mutual shall allow a representative of Washington Federal to attend
as an observer all First Mutual Board and First Mutual Board
committee meetings as well as all Board of Directors and Board of Director
committee meetings for each Subsidiary of First Mutual (including, without
limitation, loan committee meetings), except that no Washington Federal
representative will be entitled to attend any meeting in which the First
Mutual Board considers the Merger or an Acquisition Proposal. First Mutual
shall give reasonable notice to Washington Federal of any such meeting and, if
known, the agenda for or business to be discussed at such meeting. First
Mutual shall also provide to Washington Federal all written agendas and
meeting or written consent materials provided to the directors of First Mutual
and each First Mutual Subsidiary in connection with Board and committee
meetings. All information obtained by Washington Federal at these meetings
shall be treated in confidence as provided in this Section 6.06.

6.07 _Affiliates_. First Mutual shall use its reasonable best efforts to
identify those persons who may be deemed to be "affiliates" of First Mutual
within the meaning of Rule 145 promulgated by the SEC under the
Securities Act ("First Mutual Affiliates") and to cause each person so
identified to deliver to Washington Federal as soon as practicable, and in any
event prior to the date of the First Mutual Meeting, a written agreement to
comply with the requirements of Rule 145 under the Securities Act in
connection with the sale or other transfer of Washington Federal Common Stock
received in the Merger, which agreement shall be in the form attached hereto
as Annex B (the "Affiliate Letter").

6.08 _Acquisition Proposals_.

(a) First Mutual agrees that it shall, and shall direct and use its reasonable
best efforts to cause its affiliates, directors, officers, employees, agents
and representatives (including, without limitation, any investment banker,
financial advisor, attorney, accountant or other representative retained by
it) (all of the foregoing, collectively, "Representatives") to, immediately
cease any discussions or negotiations with any other parties that may be
ongoing with respect to the possibility or consideration of any Acquisition
Proposal (as defined below), and will use its reasonable best efforts to
enforce any confidentiality or similar agreement relating to any Acquisition
Proposal, including by requesting the other party to promptly return or
destroy any confidential information previously furnished by or on behalf of
First Mutual  



 

47  thereunder and by specifically enforcing the terms thereof in a court of
competent jurisdiction. From the date of this Agreement through the Effective
Time, First Mutual shall not, and shall cause its directors, officers or
employees (and those of any First Mutual Subsidiary) or any Representative
retained by it (or any Subsidiary) not to, directly or indirectly through
another Person, (i) solicit, initiate or encourage (including by way of
furnishing information or assistance), or take any other action designed to
facilitate or that is likely to result in, any inquiries or the making of any
proposal or offer that constitutes, or is reasonably likely to lead to, any
Acquisition Proposal, (ii) provide any confidential information or data to any
Person relating to any Acquisition Proposal, (iii) participate in any
discussions or negotiations regarding any Acquisition Proposal, (iv) waive,
terminate, modify or fail to enforce any provision of any contractual
"standstill" or similar obligations of any Person other than Washington
Federal or its affiliates, (v) approve or recommend, propose to approve
or recommend, or execute or enter into, any letter of intent, agreement in
principle, merger agreement, asset purchase agreement or share exchange
agreement, option agreement or other similar agreement related to any
Acquisition Proposal or propose to do any of the foregoing, or (vi) make or
authorize any statement, recommendation or solicitation in support of any
Acquisition Proposal; provided, however, that prior to the date of the First
Mutual Meeting, if the First Mutual Board determines in good faith, after
consulting with its outside legal and financial advisors, that the failure to
do so would breach, or would reasonably be expected to result in a breach of,
the First Mutual Boards fiduciary duties under applicable law, First Mutual
may, in response to a bona fide, written Acquisition Proposal not solicited in
violation of this Section 6.08(a)(i) that the First Mutual Board determines in
good faith constitutes a Superior Proposal (as defined below), subject
to providing 48 hour prior written notice of its decision to take such action
to Washington Federal and identifying the Person making the proposal and all
the material terms and conditions of such proposal and compliance with Section
6.08(b), (1) furnish information with respect to itself and its Subsidiaries
to any Person making such a Superior Proposal pursuant to a customary
confidentiality agreement (as determined by First Mutual after consultation
with its outside counsel) on terms no more favorable to such Person than the
terms contained in the Confidentiality Agreement are to Washington Federal,
and (2) participate in discussions or negotiations regarding such a Superior
Proposal. For purposes of this Agreement, the term "Acquisition Proposal"
means any inquiry, proposal or offer, filing of any regulatory application or
notice (whether in draft or final form) or disclosure of an intention to do
any of the foregoing from any Person relating to any (w) direct or indirect
acquisition or purchase of a business that constitutes 10% or more of the
total revenues, net income, assets or deposits of First Mutual and its
Subsidiaries taken as a whole, (x) direct or indirect acquisition or purchase
of any class of Equity Securities representing 10% or more of the voting power
of First Mutual or any of its Subsidiaries, (y) tender offer or exchange offer
that if consummated would result in any person beneficially owning 10%
or more of any class of Equity Securities of First Mutual or (z) merger,
consolidation, business combination, recapitalization, liquidation,
dissolution or similar transaction involving First Mutual or any of its
Subsidiaries, other than the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. For
purposes of this Agreement, the term "Superior Proposal" means any bona fide
written proposal made by a third party to acquire, directly or indirectly,
including pursuant to a tender offer, exchange offer, merger, consolidation,
business combination, recapitalization, liquidation, dissolution or similar
transaction, for consideration consisting of cash and/or securities, more than
50% of the combined voting power of the shares of First Mutual Common Stock
then outstanding or all or substantially all of First Mutuals consolidated
assets, which the First Mutual Board determines in good faith, after taking
into account all legal, financial, regulatory and other aspects of
the proposal and the person making the proposal (including any break-up fees,
expense reimbursement provisions and conditions to consummation), and after
taking into account the advice of First Mutuals financial advisor (which
shall be a nationally recognized investment banking firm) and outside
counsel, (i) is more favorable from a financial point of view to its
stockholders than the Merger, (ii) is reasonably likely to be consummated on
the terms set forth, and (iii) for which financing, to the extent required,
is then committed or which, in the good faith judgment of the First Mutual
Board, is reasonably likely to be obtained by such third party.



 

48 (b) In addition to the obligations of First Mutual set forth in Section
6.08(a), First Mutual shall promptly (within 24 hours) advise Washington
Federal orally and in writing of its receipt of any Acquisition Proposal (or
any inquiry which could lead to an Acquisition Proposal) and keep Washington
Federal informed, on a current basis, of the continuing status thereof,
including the terms and conditions thereof and any changes thereto, and shall
contemporaneously provide to Washington Federal all materials provided to or
made available to any third party pursuant to this Section 6.08 which were
not previously provided to Washington Federal.

(c) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, First Mutual and the
First Mutual Board shall be permitted to comply with Rule 14d-9 and Rule 14e-2
promulgated under the Exchange Act; provided, however, that compliance with
such rules will in no way limit or modify the effect that any action pursuant
to such rules would otherwise have under this Agreement.

(d) First Mutual agrees that any violation of the restrictions set forth in
this Section 6.08 by any Representative of First Mutual or its Subsidiaries
shall be deemed a breach of this Section 6.08 by First Mutual.

6.09 _Certain Policies_. Prior to the Effective Date, each of First Mutual and
its Subsidiaries shall, consistent with GAAP, the rules and regulations of the
SEC and applicable banking laws and regulations, use its reasonable best
efforts to modify or change its Loan, OREO, accrual, reserve, Tax, litigation
and real estate valuation policies and practices (including loan
classifications and levels of reserves) so as to be applied on a basis that
is consistent with that of Washington Federal; provided, however, that no
such modifications or changes need be made prior to the satisfaction of the
conditions set forth in Section 7.01(b); and further provided that in any
event, no accrual or reserve made by First Mutual or any of its Subsidiaries
pursuant to this Section 6.09 shall constitute or be deemed to be a breach,
violation of or failure to satisfy any representation, warranty, covenant,
agreement, condition or other provision of this Agreement or otherwise be
considered in determining whether any such breach, violation or failure to
satisfy shall have occurred. The recording of any such adjustments shall not
be deemed to imply any misstatement of previously furnished financial
statements or information and shall not be construed as concurrence of First
Mutual or its management with any such adjustments.



 

49 6.10 _Nasdaq Listing_. Washington Federal agrees to use its reasonable best
efforts to list, prior to the Effective Date, on the Nasdaq the shares of
Washington Federal Common Stock to be issued in connection with the Merger.

6.11  _Indemnification_.

(a) From and after the Effective Time through the sixth anniversary of the
Effective Time, Washington Federal (the "Indemnifying Party") shall indemnify
and hold harmless each present and former director, officer and employee of
First Mutual or a First Mutual Subsidiary, as applicable, determined as of the
Effective Time (the "Indemnified Parties") against any costs or expenses
(including reasonable attorneys fees), judgments, fines, losses, claims,
damages or liabilities incurred in connection with any claim, action, suit,
proceeding or investigation, whether civil, criminal, administrative or
investigative, arising out of matters existing or occurring at or prior to the
Effective Time, whether asserted or claimed prior to, at or after the
Effective Time, arising in whole or in part out of or pertaining to the fact
that he or she was a director, officer, employee, fiduciary or agent of First
Mutual or any First Mutual Subsidiary or is or was serving at the request of
First Mutual or any First Mutual Subsidiary as a director, officer, employee,
fiduciary or agent of another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust
or other enterprise, including without limitation matters related to the
negotiation, execution and performance of this Agreement or consummation of
the Transaction, to the fullest extent which such Indemnified Parties would
be entitled under the First Mutual Articles and the First Mutual Bylaws or
equivalent documents of any First Mutual Subsidiary, as applicable, or any
agreement, arrangement or understanding which has been Previously Disclosed
by First Mutual pursuant to this Section 6.11, in each case as in effect on
the date hereof.

(b) Any Indemnified Party wishing to claim indemnification under this Section
6.11, upon learning of any such claim, action, suit, proceeding or
investigation, shall promptly notify the Indemnifying Party, but the failure
to so notify shall not relieve the Indemnifying Party of any liability it may
have to such Indemnified Party if such failure does not actually prejudice the
Indemnifying Party. In the event of any such claim, action, suit, proceeding
or investigation (whether arising before or after the Effective Time), (i)
the Indemnifying Party shall have the right to assume the defense thereof and
the Indemnifying Party shall not be liable to such Indemnified Parties for any
legal expenses of other counsel or any other expenses subsequently incurred
by such Indemnified Parties in connection with the defense thereof, except
that if the Indemnifying Party elects not to assume such defense or counsel
for the Indemnified Parties advises that there are issues which
raise conflicts of interest between the Indemnifying Party and the
Indemnified Parties that make joint representation inappropriate, the
Indemnified Parties may retain counsel which is reasonably satisfactory to the
Indemnifying Party, and the Indemnifying Party shall pay, promptly as
statements therefor are received, the reasonable fees and expenses of such
counsel for the Indemnified Parties (which may not exceed one firm in any
jurisdiction unless the Indemnified Parties have conflicts of interest), (ii)
the Indemnified Parties will cooperate in the defense of any such matter,
(iii) the Indemnifying Party shall not be liable for any settlement effected
without its prior written consent, which shall not be unreasonably withheld,
and (iv) the Indemnifying Party shall have no obligation hereunder in the
event that a federal or state banking agency or a court of competent
jurisdiction shall determine that indemnification of an Indemnified Party in
the manner contemplated hereby is prohibited by applicable laws and
regulations.



 

50 (c) Washington Federal shall maintain First Mutuals existing directors and
officers liability insurance policy (or provide a policy providing
comparable coverage and amounts on terms no less favorable to the persons
currently covered by First Mutuals existing policy, including Washington
Federals existing policy if it meets the foregoing standard) covering
persons who are currently covered by such insurance for a period of three (3)
years after the Effective Time; provided, however, that in no event shall
Washington Federal be obligated to expend, in order to maintain or provide
insurance coverage pursuant to this Section 6.11(c), an amount in excess of
150% of the annual premiums paid by First Mutual as of the date hereof for
such insurance ("Maximum Insurance Amount"); provided further, that if the
amount of the annual premiums necessary to maintain or procure such insurance
coverage exceeds the Maximum Insurance Amount, Washington Federal shall obtain
the most advantageous coverage obtainable for an annual premium equal to the
Maximum Insurance Amount.

(d) If Washington Federal or any of its successors or assigns shall
consolidate with or merge into any other entity and shall not be the
continuing or surviving entity of such consolidation or merger or shall
transfer all or substantially all of its assets to any other entity, then and
in each case, proper provision shall be made so that the successors and
assigns of Washington Federal shall assume the obligations set forth in this
Section 6.11.

6.12 _Benefit Plans_. 

(a) As soon as administratively practicable after the Effective Time,
Washington Federal shall take all reasonable action so that employees of
First Mutual and its Subsidiaries shall be entitled to participate in each
employee benefit plan, program or arrangement of Washington Federal of general
applicability (the "Washington Federal Benefit Plans") to the same extent
as similarly-situated employees of Washington Federal and its Subsidiaries
(it being understood that inclusion of the employees of First Mutual and its
Subsidiaries in the Washington Federal Benefit Plans may occur at different
times with respect to different plans), provided that coverage shall be
continued under the corresponding Benefit Plans of First Mutual and its
Subsidiaries until such employees are permitted to participate in the
Washington Federal Benefit Plans and provided further, however, that nothing
contained herein shall require Washington Federal or any of its Subsidiaries
to make any grants to any former employee of First Mutual or its Subsidiaries
under any discretionary equity compensation plan of Washington
Federal. Washington Federal shall cause each Washington Federal Benefit Plan
in which employees of First Mutual and its Subsidiaries are eligible to
participate to recognize, for purposes of determining eligibility to
participate in, the vesting of benefits and for all other purposes (but not
for accrual of pension benefits) under the Washington Federal Benefit Plans,
the service of such employees with First Mutual and its Subsidiaries to the
same extent as such service was credited for such purpose by First Mutual,
provided, however, that such service shall not be recognized to the extent
that such recognition would result in a duplication of benefits. Nothing
herein shall limit the ability of Washington Federal to amend or terminate any
of First Mutuals Benefit Plans in accordance with their terms at any time.



 

51 (b) At and following the Effective Time, Washington Federal shall honor, and
the Surviving Corporation shall continue to be obligated to perform, in
accordance with their terms, all benefit obligations to, and contractual
rights of, current and former employees of First Mutual and its Subsidiaries
and current and former directors of First Mutual and its Subsidiaries
existing as of the Effective Date, as well as all employment, severance,
bonus, salary continuation, deferred compensation, split dollar, supplemental
retirement or "change-in-control" agreements, plans or policies of First
Mutual to the extent that each of the foregoing are Previously Disclosed. The
severance or termination payments which are payable pursuant to such
agreements, plans or policies of First Mutual (which have been quantified in
reasonable detail) have been Previously Disclosed.

(c) At such time as employees of First Mutual or its Subsidiaries become
eligible to participate in a medical, dental or health plan of Washington
Federal or its Subsidiaries, Washington Federal shall cause each such plan to
(i) waive any preexisting condition limitations to the extent such conditions
covered under the applicable medical, health or dental plans of Washington
Federal, (ii) provide full credit under such plans for any deductibles, co-
payment and out-of-pocket expenses incurred by the employees and their
beneficiaries during the portion of the calendar year prior to such
participation and (iii) waive any waiting period limitation or evidence of
insurability requirement which would otherwise be applicable to such employee
on or after the Effective Time to the extent such employee had satisfied
any similar limitation or requirement under an analogous Plan prior to the
Effective Time.

(d) Each of First Mutual, its Subsidiaries, and Washington Federal
acknowledges and agrees that all provisions contained within this Section 6.12
with respect to Employees are included for the sole benefit of First Mutual
and Washington Federal and shall not create any right (i) in any other
Person, including, Benefit Plans or any beneficiary thereof or (ii) to
continued employment with First Mutual, its Subsidiaries, Washington Federal
or any of their respective affiliates.

(e) Washington Federal agrees to take all action necessary to appoint or
elect, effective as of the Effective Time, a director of First Mutual who
is acceptable to Washington Federal. Such person shall serve until the first
annual meeting of stockholders of Washington Federal following the Effective
Time and until his or her successor is elected and qualified. Subject to the
fiduciary duties of the Washington Federal Board, Washington Federal shall
include such individual on the list of nominees for director presented by the
Washington Federal Board and for which the Washington Federal Board shall
solicit proxies at the first annual meeting of stockholders of Washington
Federal following the Effective Time.

(f) The First Mutual Employee Stock Ownership Plan ("ESOP") shall be
terminated as of the Effective Time. The Merger Consideration received by the
ESOP trustee with respect to the unallocated shares of First Mutual Common
Stock held by the ESOP shall be allocated to the ESOP participants in
accordance with the terms of the ESOP and applicable laws as soon as
practicable after the Effective Time. In connection with the termination of
the ESOP, First Mutual shall promptly apply to the IRS for a favorable
determination letter on the tax-qualified status of the ESOP on terminations
and any amendments made to the ESOP in connection with its termination or
otherwise, if such amendments have not previously received a  



 

52  favorable determination letter from the IRS with respect to their
qualification under Section 401(a) of the Code. Any amendments to the ESOP
requested by the IRS prior to the Effective Time shall be adopted by First
Mutual and any amendments requested by the IRS after the Effective Time shall
be promptly adopted by Washington Federal. Any and all distributions from the
ESOP after its termination shall be made consistent with the aforementioned
determination letter from the IRS.

6.13 _Notification of Certain Matters_. Each of First Mutual and Washington
Federal shall give prompt notice to the other of any fact, event or
circumstance known to it that (i) is reasonably likely, individually or taken
together with all other facts, events and circumstances known to it, to
result in any Material Adverse Effect with respect to it or (ii) would cause
or constitute a material breach of any of its representations, warranties,
covenants or agreements contained herein.

6.14 _Estoppel Letters_. First Mutual shall use its commercially reasonable
efforts to obtain and deliver to Washington Federal at the Closing
with respect to all real estate (i) owned by First Mutual or its
Subsidiaries, an estoppel letter dated as of the Closing in the form of Annex
D from all tenants and (ii) leased by First Mutual or its Subsidiaries, an
estoppel letter dated as of the Closing in the form of Annex E from all
lessors.

6.15 _Assumption of Indenture Obligations_. In connection with the
Merger, Washington Federal shall execute such supplemental indentures and
provide such documents, including without limitation legal opinions, as are
reasonably required upon a merger or consolidation of First Mutual under the
indentures, trust agreements, guarantee agreements and other agreements
Previously Disclosed by First Mutual or any of its Subsidiaries to the extent
such indenture obligations have not been discharged through the redemption of
the underlying securities.

6.16 _Antitakeover Statutes_. Each of Washington Federal and First Mutual and
their respective Boards of Directors shall, if any state antitakeover statute
or similar statute becomes applicable to this Agreement and the Transaction,
take all action reasonably necessary to ensure that the Transaction may be
consummated as promptly as practicable on the terms contemplated hereby and
otherwise to minimize the effect of such statute or regulation on this
Agreement and the Transaction.

and First Mutual.

(b) _Breach_. Provided that the terminating party is not then in material
breach of any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement contained

(b), as the case may be.

(c) _Delay_. By Washington Federal or First Mutual, in the event that the
Merger is not consummated by March 31, 2008, except to the extent that the

this Agreement or (ii) the failure of any of the Shareholders (if First Mutual
is the party seeking to terminate) to perform or observe their respective

or an application therefor shall have been permanently withdrawn at the
request of a Governmental Authority, provided, however, that no party shall
have the right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this Section 8.01(d) if
such denial shall be due to the failure of the party seeking to terminate
this Agreement to perform or observe the covenants of such party set forth
herein.

(e) _No First Mutual Stockholder Approval_. By either Washington Federal or
First Mutual, if any approval of the stockholders of First Mutual contemplated

shall have occurred, or (C) by either Washington Federal or First Mutual
pursuant to Section 8.01(e), and in the case of any termination pursuant to

First Mutual or the First Mutual Board (or any Person shall have publicly
announced, communicated or made known an intention, whether or not
conditional, to make an Acquisition Proposal, or reiterated a previously

the date of this Agreement and prior to the taking of the vote of the
stockholders of First Mutual contemplated by this Agreement at the First
Mutual Meeting, in the case of clause (C), or the date of termination, in the
case of clause (A) or (B), then (1) if within 15 months after such termination

million on the date of execution of such agreement and upon consummation of
any such Control Transaction at any time thereafter, First Mutual shall pay to

Transaction. As used in this Section 8.02(b), a "Control  



 

57  Transaction" means (i) the acquisition by any Person whether by purchase,

by Washington Federal.

(c) First Mutual and Washington Federal agree that the agreement contained in
paragraph (b) above is an integral part of the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement, that without such agreement Washington Federal would not have
entered into this Agreement, and that such amounts do not constitute a penalty
or liquidated damages in the event of a breach of this Agreement by First
Mutual. If First Mutual fails to pay Washington Federal the amounts due under
paragraph (b) above within the time periods specified in such paragraph (b),
First Mutual shall pay the costs and expenses (including reasonable legal
fees and expenses) incurred by Washington Federal in connection with any
action, including the filing of any lawsuit, taken to collect payment of such
amounts, provided Washington Federal prevails on the merits, together
with interest on the amount of any such unpaid amounts at the prime lending
rate prevailing during such period as published in _The Wall Street Journal_ ,
calculated on a daily basis from the date such amounts were required to be
paid until the date of actual payment.

ARTICLE IX

MISCELLANEOUS

this Agreement is terminated prior to the Effective Time (other than Sections
6.06(c), 8.02 and this Article IX, which shall survive any such termination).
Notwithstanding anything in the foregoing to the contrary, no representations,
warranties, agreements and covenants contained in this Agreement shall be
deemed to be terminated or extinguished so as to deprive a party hereto or any
of its affiliates of any defense at law or in equity which otherwise would be
available against the claims of any Person, including without limitation any
shareholder or former shareholder.

9.02 _Waiver; Amendment_. Prior to the Effective Time, any provision of this
Agreement may be (i) waived, by the party benefited by the provision or (ii)

counterparts, each of which shall be deemed to constitute an original.

9.04 _Governing Law_. This Agreement shall be governed by, and interpreted in

fraud or willful breach of any provision of this Agreement.

party shall be in writing and shall be deemed given if personally delivered,

9.07 _Entire Understanding; No Third Party Beneficiaries_. This Agreement, the
Bank Merger Agreement, the Shareholder Agreements and the Confidentiality
Agreement represent the entire understanding of the parties hereto and thereto
with reference to the Transaction, and this Agreement, the Bank Merger
Agreement, the Shareholder Agreements and the Confidentiality Agreement
supersede any and all other oral or written agreements heretofore made. Except
for the Indemnified Parties right to enforce Washington Federals obligation
under Section 6.11, which are expressly intended to be for the irrevocable
benefit of, and shall be enforceable by, each Indemnified Party and his or her
heirs and representatives, nothing in this Agreement, expressed or implied, is
intended to confer upon any Person, other than the parties hereto or their
respective successors, any rights, remedies, obligations or liabilities under
or by reason of this Agreement.

9.08  _Severability_. Except to the extent that application of this Section
9.08 would have a Material Adverse Effect on First Mutual or Washington
Federal, any term or provision of this Agreement which is invalid or
unenforceable in any jurisdiction shall, as to that jurisdiction, be
ineffective to the extent of such invalidity or unenforceability without
rendering invalid or unenforceable the remaining terms and provisions of this
Agreement or affecting the validity or enforceability of any of the terms or
provisions of this Agreement in any other jurisdiction. If any provision of
this Agreement is so broad as to be unenforceable, the provision shall be
interpreted to be only so broad as is enforceable. In all such cases, the
parties shall use their reasonable best efforts to substitute a valid, legal
and enforceable provision which, insofar as practicable, implements the
original purposes and intents of this Agreement.

9.09 _Enforcement of the Agreement_. The parties hereto agree that irreparable
damage would occur in the event that any of the provisions of this Agreement
were not performed in accordance with their specific terms or were otherwise
breached. It is accordingly agreed that the parties shall be entitled to an
injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to
enforce specifically the terms and provisions hereof in any court of the
United States or any state having jurisdiction, this being in addition to any
other remedy to which they are entitled at law or in equity. In the event
attorneys fees or other costs are incurred to secure performance of any of
the obligations herein provided for, or to establish damages for the breach
thereof, or to obtain any other appropriate relief, whether by way of
prosecution or defense, the prevailing party shall be entitled to recover
reasonable attorneys fees and costs incurred therein.

9.10 _Interpretation_. When a reference is made in this Agreement to
Sections, Exhibits or Schedules, such reference shall be to a Section of, or

SHAREHOLDER AGREEMENT (the "Agreement"), dated as of July 2, 2007, among _
_, a shareholder ("Shareholder") of First Mutual Bancshares, Inc., a
Washington corporation ("First Mutual"), Washington Federal, Inc., a
Washington corporation ("Washington Federal"), and, solely for purposes of the

Agreement (defined below).

WHEREAS, First Mutual and Washington Federal are entering into an Agreement
and Plan of Merger, dated as of the date hereof (the "Merger Agreement"),
pursuant to which First Mutual will merge with and into Washington Federal on
the terms and conditions set forth therein (the "Merger") and, in connection
therewith, outstanding shares of First Mutual Common Stock will be converted
into shares of Washington Federal Common Stock and cash in the manner
set forth therein; and

WHEREAS, Shareholder owns the shares of First Mutual Common Stock identified
on Exhibit I hereto (such shares, together with all shares of First Mutual
Common Stock subsequently acquired by Shareholder during the term of this
Agreement, being referred to as the "Shares"); and

WHEREAS, in order to induce Washington Federal to enter into the Merger
Agreement, Shareholder, solely in such Shareholders capacity as
a shareholder of First Mutual and not in any other capacity, has agreed to
enter into and perform this Agreement.

NOW, THEREFORE, for good and valuable consideration, the receipt, sufficiency
and adequacy of which are hereby acknowledged, the parties hereto agree as
follows:

1\. _Agreement to Vote Shares_. Shareholder agrees that at any meeting of the
stockholders of First Mutual, or in connection with any written consent of the
stockholders of First Mutual, Shareholder shall:

(a) appear at each such meeting or otherwise cause the Shares to be counted as
present thereat for purposes of calculating a quorum; and

(b) vote (or cause to be voted), in person or by proxy, or deliver a written
consent (or cause a consent to be delivered) covering, all the
Shares (whether acquired heretofore or hereafter) that are beneficially owned
by Shareholder or as to which Shareholder has, directly or indirectly, the
right to vote or direct the voting, (x) in favor of adoption and approval of
the Merger Agreement and the Merger; (y) against any action or agreement that
could reasonably be expected to result in a breach of any covenant,
representation or warranty or any other obligation or agreement of First
Mutual contained in the Merger Agreement or of Shareholder contained in this
Agreement; and (z) against any Acquisition Proposal or any other action,
agreement or transaction that is intended, or could reasonably be expected, to
materially impede, interfere or be inconsistent with, delay, postpone,
discourage or materially and adversely affect consummation of the Merger or
the performance by Shareholder of his, her or its obligations under this
Agreement.



 

A-1 2\. _Transfer of Shares_.



     |  |  |  | 
---|---|---|---|--- 
   |  |  |  |

(a) _Prohibition on Transfers of Shares; Other Actions_. Shareholder hereby
agrees that while this Agreement is in effect, Shareholder shall not, (i)
sell, transfer, pledge, encumber (except for pledges or encumbrances existing
as of the date of this Agreement), distribute by gift or donation, or
otherwise dispose of any of the Shares (or any securities convertible into or
exercisable or exchangeable for Shares) or any interest therein, whether by
actual disposition, physical settlement or effective economic disposition
through hedging transactions, derivative instruments or other means, (ii)
enter into any agreement, arrangement or understanding with any Person, or
take any other action, that violates or conflicts with or could reasonably be
expected to violate or conflict with Shareholders representations,
warranties, covenants and obligations under this Agreement, or (iii) take any
other action that could reasonably be expected to impair or otherwise
adversely affect, in any material respect, Shareholders power, authority and
ability to comply with and perform his, her or its covenants and
obligations under this Agreement. 

   |  | 
   |  |  |  |

(b) _Transfer of Voting Rights_. Shareholder hereby agrees that Shareholder
shall not deposit any Shares in a voting trust, grant any proxy or enter
into any voting agreement or similar agreement or arrangement with respect to
any of the Shares. 

 

3\. _Representations and Warranties of Shareholder_. Shareholder represents
and warrants to and agrees with Washington Federal as follows:

(a) _Capacity_. Shareholder has all requisite capacity and authority to enter
into and perform his, her or its obligations under this Agreement.



 

A-2 (b) _Binding Agreement_. This Agreement has been duly executed and delivered
by Shareholder and constitutes the valid and legally binding obligation of
Shareholder, subject to bankruptcy, insolvency, fraudulent transfer,
reorganization, moratorium and similar laws of general applicability relating
to or affecting creditors rights and to general equity principles.

(c) _Non-Contravention_. The execution and delivery of this Agreement by
Shareholder does not, and the performance by Shareholder of his, her or its
obligations hereunder and the consummation by Shareholder of the transactions
contemplated hereby will not, violate or conflict with, or constitute a
default under, any agreement, instrument, contract or other obligation or any
order, arbitration award, judgment or decree to which Shareholder is a party
or by which Shareholder is bound, or any statute, rule or regulation to which
Shareholder is subject or, in the event that Shareholder is a corporation,
partnership, trust or other entity, any charter, bylaw or other organizational
document of Shareholder.

(d) _Ownership_. Shareholders Shares are, and through the term of this
Agreement will be, owned beneficially and of record solely by Shareholder
except as otherwise disclosed on Exhibit I hereto. Shareholder has good and
marketable title to the Shares, free and clear of any lien, pledge, mortgage,
security interest or other encumbrance. As of the date hereof, the Shares
identified on Exhibit I hereto constitute all of the shares of First Mutual
Common Stock owned beneficially or of record by Shareholder. Shareholder has
and will have at all times during the term of this Agreement (i) sole voting
power and sole power to issue instructions with respect to the matters set
forth in Section 1 hereof, (ii) sole power of disposition and (iii) sole
power to agree to all of the matters set forth in this Agreement, in each case
with respect to all of the Shares owned by Shareholder on the date of this
Agreement and all of the Shares hereafter acquired by Shareholder and owned
beneficially or of record by him, her or it during the term of this Agreement.
For purposes of this Agreement, the term "beneficial ownership" shall be
interpreted in accordance with Rule 13d-3 under the Exchange Act,  _provided_
that a Person shall be deemed to beneficially own any securities which may be
acquired by such Person pursuant to any agreement, arrangement or
understanding or upon the exercise of conversion rights, exchange rights,
warrants or options, or otherwise (irrespective of whether the right to
acquire such securities is exercisable immediately or only after the passage
of time, including the passage of time within 60 days, the satisfaction of any
conditions, the occurrence of any event or any combination of the foregoing).

(e) _Consents and Approvals_. The execution and delivery of this Agreement by
Shareholder does not, and the performance by Shareholder of his, her or its
obligations under this Agreement and the consummation by him, her or it of the
transactions contemplated hereby will not, require Shareholder to obtain any
consent, approval, authorization or permit of, or to make any filing with or
notification to, any Governmental Authority.

(f) _Absence of Litigation_. There is no suit, action, investigation or
proceeding pending or, to the knowledge of Shareholder, threatened against or
affecting Shareholder or any of his, her or its affiliates before or by any
Governmental Authority that  



 

A-3  could reasonably be expected to materially impair the ability of Shareholder
to perform his, her or its obligations hereunder or to consummate
the transactions contemplated hereby on a timely basis.

4\. _No Solicitation_. Shareholder hereby agrees that during the term of
this Agreement he, she or it shall not, and shall not permit any investment
banker, financial advisor, attorney, accountant or other representative
retained by him, her or it to, directly or indirectly, (a) take any of the
actions specified in clauses (i)-(vi) of Section 6.08 of the Merger
Agreement, (b) agree to release, or release, any Person from any obligation
under any existing standstill agreement or arrangement relating to First
Mutual, or (c) participate in, directly or indirectly, a "solicitation" of
"proxies" (as such terms are used in the rules of the SEC) or powers of
attorney or similar rights to vote, or seek to advise or influence any Person
with respect to the voting of, any shares of First Mutual Common Stock in
connection with any vote or other action on any matter of a type described in
Section 1(b), other than to recommend that stockholders of First Mutual vote
in favor of the adoption and approval of the Merger Agreement and the Merger
and as otherwise expressly permitted by this Agreement. Shareholder agrees
immediately to cease and cause to be terminated any activities, discussions or
negotiations conducted before the date of this Agreement with any Persons
other than Washington Federal with respect to any possible Acquisition
Proposal and will take all necessary steps to inform any investment banker,
financial advisor, attorney, accountant or other representative retained by
him, her or it of the obligations undertaken by Shareholder pursuant to this
Section 4\. Nothing contained in this Section 4 shall prevent a Shareholder
who is an officer or a member of the First Mutual Board from discharging his
or her fiduciary duties solely in his or her capacity as such an officer or
director.

5\. _Notice of Acquisitions; Proposals Regarding Prohibited Transactions_.
Shareholder hereby agrees to notify Washington Federal promptly (and in any
event within two (2) Business Days) in writing of the number of any additional
shares of First Mutual Common Stock or other securities of First Mutual of
which Shareholder acquires beneficial or record ownership on or after the date
hereof. Shareholder will comply with the provisions of Section 6.08(b) of the
Merger Agreement as if he, she or it were First Mutual.

6\. _Specific Performance and Remedies_. Shareholder acknowledges that it will
be impossible to measure in money the damage to Washington Federal
if Shareholder fails to comply with the obligations imposed by this Agreement
and that, in the event of any such failure, Washington Federal will not have
an adequate remedy at law. Accordingly, Shareholder agrees that injunctive
relief or other equitable remedy, in addition to remedies at law or in
damages, is the appropriate remedy for any such failure and will not oppose
the granting of such relief on the basis that Washington Federal may have an
adequate remedy at law. Shareholder agrees that Shareholder will not seek,
and agrees to waive any requirement for, the securing or posting of a bond in
connection with Washington Federals seeking or obtaining such equitable
relief.

7\. _Term of Agreement; Termination_.

(a) The term of this Agreement shall commence on the date hereof.



 

A-4 (b) This Agreement shall terminate upon the earlier to occur of (i) the date,
if any, of termination of the Merger Agreement in accordance with its terms,
or (ii) the Effective Time of the Merger. Upon such termination, no party
shall have any further obligations or liabilities hereunder; provided,
however, such termination shall not relieve any party from liability for any
willful breach of this Agreement prior to such termination.

8\. _Stop Transfer Order_. In furtherance of this Agreement, Shareholder
hereby authorizes and instructs First Mutual to instruct its transfer agent to
enter a stop transfer order with respect to all of Shareholders Shares for
the period from the date hereof through the date this Agreement is terminated
in accordance with Section 7\. First Mutual agrees that as promptly as
practicable after the date of this Agreement it shall give such stop transfer
instructions to the transfer agent for the First Mutual Common Stock. 

9\. _Entire Agreement_. This Agreement supersedes all prior agreements,
written or oral, among the parties hereto with respect to the subject matter
hereof and contains the entire agreement among the parties with respect to the
subject matter hereof. This Agreement may not be amended, supplemented or
modified, and no provisions hereof may be modified or waived, except by
an instrument in writing signed by each party hereto. No waiver of any
provisions hereof by any party shall be deemed a waiver of any other
provisions hereof by any such party, nor shall any such waiver be deemed a
continuing waiver of any provision hereof by such party.

10\. _Notices_. All notices, requests, claims, demands or other communications
hereunder shall be in writing and shall be deemed given when delivered
personally, upon receipt of a transmission confirmation if sent by telecopy or
like transmission and on the next Business Day when sent by a reputable
overnight courier service to the parties at the following addresses (or at
such other address for a party as shall be specified by like notice):

(e) _Governing Law; Consent to Jurisdiction; Waiver of Jury Trial_.

(i) This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the
laws of the State of Washington without giving effect to the principles of

unconditionally consents to submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of the King
County Superior Court of the State of Washington or, if under applicable law
exclusive jurisdiction over the Litigation (as defined below) lies with the
courts of the United States, any court of the United States located in the
State of Washington, for any action, suit, proceeding or investigation in any
court or before any Governmental Authority  



 

A-6  ("Litigation") arising out of or relating to this Agreement and the
transactions contemplated hereby. Each of the parties hereto hereby
irrevocably and unconditionally waives, and agrees not to assert, by way of
motion, as a defense, counterclaim or otherwise, in any such Litigation, any
claim that he, she or it is not personally subject to the jurisdiction of the

attachment prior to judgment, attachment in aid of execution of judgment,
execution of judgment or otherwise), and to the fullest extent permitted by
applicable law, that the Litigation in any such court is brought in an
inconvenient forum, that the venue of such Litigation is improper, or that

such courts and further irrevocably waives, to the fullest extent permitted
by applicable law, the benefit of any defense that would hinder, fetter or
delay the levy, execution or collection of any amount to which the party is
entitled pursuant to the final judgment of any court having jurisdiction. Each
of the parties irrevocably and unconditionally waives, to the fullest extent
permitted by applicable law, any and all rights to trial by jury in connection

of copies thereof by registered mail, postage prepaid, to such party at his,
her or its address set forth in this Agreement, such service of process to be
effective upon acknowledgment of receipt of such registered mail. 

(iii) Each of the parties hereto expressly acknowledges that the foregoing
waivers are intended to be irrevocable under the laws of the State of
Washington and of the United States of America; provided that consent by the
parties to jurisdiction and service contained in this Section 11(e) is solely
for the purpose referred to in this Section 11(e) and shall not be deemed to
be a general submission to said courts or in the State of Washington other
than for such purpose.

(f) _Successors and Assigns; Third Party Beneficiaries_. Neither this
Agreement nor any of the rights or obligations of any party under this
Agreement shall be assigned, in whole or in part, by any party without the
prior written consent of the other parties hereto. Subject to the foregoing,
this Agreement shall bind and inure to the benefit of and be enforceable by
the parties hereto and their respective successors and permitted assigns.

Person other than the parties hereto or their respective successors and
permitted assigns any rights, remedies, obligations or liabilities under or by
reason of this Agreement.

12\. _Attorney s Fees_. The prevailing party or parties in any litigation,
arbitration, mediation, bankruptcy, insolvency or other proceeding
("Proceeding") relating to the enforcement or interpretation of this
Agreement may recover from the unsuccessful party or parties all reasonable
fees and disbursements of counsel (including expert witness and other
consultants fees and costs) relating to or arising out of (a) the Proceeding
(whether or not the Proceeding proceeds to judgment), and (b) any post-
judgment or post-award proceeding including, without limitation, one to

A-9 ANNEX B

_ _, 2007

Washington Federal, Inc.

425 Pike Street

Seattle, Washington 98101

Ladies and Gentlemen:

I have been advised that I may be deemed to be, but do not admit that I am, an
"affiliate" of First Mutual Bancshares, Inc., a Washington corporation
("First Mutual"), as that term is defined in Rule 144 and used in Rule 145
promulgated by the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC") under the
Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "Securities Act"). I understand that
pursuant to the terms of the Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated as of July 2,
2007 (the "Agreement"), between Washington Federal, Inc., a Washington
corporation ("Washington Federal"), and First Mutual, First Mutual plans to
merge with and into Washington Federal (the "Merger").

I further understand that as a result of the Merger, I may receive shares of
common stock, par value $1.00 per share, of Washington Federal ("Washington
Federal Common Stock") and cash in exchange for shares of common stock, par
value $1.00 per share, of First Mutual ("First Mutual Common Stock").

I have carefully read this letter and reviewed the Agreement and discussed
their requirements and other applicable limitations upon my ability to sell,
transfer, or otherwise dispose of Washington Federal Common Stock, to the
extent I felt necessary, with my counsel or counsel for First Mutual.

I represent, warrant and covenant with and to Washington Federal that in the
event I receive any shares of Washington Federal Common Stock as a result
of the Merger:

1\. I shall not make any sale, transfer, or other disposition of such shares
of Washington Federal Common Stock unless (i) such sale, transfer or other
disposition has been registered under the Securities Act, (ii) such sale,
transfer or other disposition is made in conformity with the provisions of
Rule 145 under the Securities Act (as such rule may be amended from time to
time), or (iii) in the opinion of counsel in form and substance reasonably
satisfactory to Washington Federal, or under a "no-action" letter obtained by
me from the staff of the SEC, such sale, transfer or other disposition will
not violate the registration requirements of, or is otherwise exempt from
registration under, the Securities Act.

2\. I understand that Washington Federal is under no obligation to register
the sale, transfer or other disposition of shares of Washington Federal Common
Stock by me or on my behalf under the Securities Act or to take any other
action necessary in order to make compliance with an exemption from such
registration available.



 

B-1 3\. I understand that stop transfer instructions will be given to Washington
Federals transfer agent with respect to shares of Washington Federal Common
Stock issued to me as a result of the Merger and that there will be placed on
the certificates for such shares, or any substitutions therefor, a legend
stating in substance:

"The shares represented by this certificate were issued as a result of the
merger of First Mutual Bancshares, Inc., with and into Washington
Federal, Inc., on _ _, 2007, in a transaction to which
Rule 145 promulgated under the Securities Act of 1933 applies. The
shares represented by this certificate may be transferred only in accordance
with the terms of a letter agreement between the registered holder hereof and
Washington Federal, Inc., a copy of which agreement is on file at the
principal offices of Washington Federal, Inc."

4\. I understand that, unless transfer by me of the Washington Federal Common
Stock issued to me as a result of the Merger has been registered under the
Securities Act or such transfer is made in conformity with the provisions of
Rule 145(d) under the Securities Act, Washington Federal reserves the right,
in its sole discretion, to place the following legend on the certificates
issued to my transferee:

"The shares represented by this certificate have not been registered under the
Securities Act of 1933 and were acquired from [SHAREHOLDER] who, in turn,
received such shares as a result of the merger of First Mutual Bancshares,
Inc. with and into Washington Federal, Inc. on  _ _,
2007, in a transaction to which Rule 145 under the Securities Act of 1933
applies. The shares have been acquired by the holder not with a view to, or
for resale in connection with, any distribution thereof within the meaning of
the Securities Act of 1933 and may not be offered, sold, pledged or otherwise
transferred except in accordance with an exemption from the registration
requirements of the Securities Act of 1933."

It is understood and agreed that the legends set forth in paragraphs (3) and
(4) above shall be removed by delivery of substitute certificates without such
legends if I shall have delivered to Washington Federal (i) a copy of a "no
action" letter from the staff of the SEC, or an opinion of counsel in form
and substance reasonably satisfactory to Washington Federal, to the effect
that such legend is not required for purposes of the Securities Act, or (ii)
evidence or representations satisfactory to Washington Federal
that Washington Federal Common Stock represented by such certificates is
being or has been sold in conformity with the provisions of Rule 145(d).

I further understand and agree that the provisions of Rule 145 shall apply to
all shares of Washington Federal Common Stock that my spouse, any relative of
mine, or any relative of my spouse, any one of whom has the same home as
me, receives as a result of the Merger and I further represent, warrant and
covenant with and to Washington Federal that I will have, and will cause each
of such persons to have, all shares of First Mutual Common Stock owned (other
than shares held through tax qualified retirement or benefit plans) by me or
such persons registered in my name or the name of such persons, as applicable,
prior to the effective date of the Merger and not in the name of any bank,
broker or dealer, nominee or clearing house.



 

B-2 By acceptance hereof, Washington Federal agrees, for a period of two years
after the Effective Time (as defined in the Agreement) that, so long as it is
obligated to file reports pursuant to Section 13 or 15(d) of the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, it will use its reasonable best efforts to
timely file such reports so that the public information requirements of Rule
144(c) promulgated under the Securities Act are satisfied and the resale
provisions of Rule 145(d)(1) and (2) are therefore available to me in the
event I desire to transfer any Washington Federal Common Stock issued to me
in the Merger.
