 __WHEREAS, each outstanding share of common stock, without par value, of the

and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement and in accordance

 _AGREEMENT_

 

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing and the respective
representations, warranties, covenants and agreements set forth herein, and
intending to be legally bound hereby, the Parties agree as follows:

ARTICLE I

 

 _The Merger_

 

 __1.1 _The Merger_ __. On the terms and subject to the satisfaction or waiver
of the conditions set forth in this Agreement, and in accordance with
California Law, at the Effective Time, Merger Sub shall be merged with and
into the Company, whereupon the separate corporate existence of Merger Sub
will cease, with the Company continuing as the surviving corporation (the
Company, as the surviving corporation in the Merger, sometimes being referred
to herein as the " _Surviving Corporation_ "), such that immediately following
the Merger, the Surviving Corporation will be a wholly owned subsidiary of
Parent. The Merger shall have the effect provided in this Agreement and as
specified in the California Law. __

 

 __1.2 _Closing_ __. Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth
herein, the closing of the Merger (the " _Closing_ ") will take place at
10:00 a.m., California time, as soon as practicable (and, in any event, within
two (2) Business Days) after satisfaction or, to the extent permitted
hereunder, waiver of all conditions set forth in ARTICLE VIII (other than
those conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied at the Closing, but
subject to the satisfaction or, to the extent permitted hereunder, waiver of
all such conditions), unless this Agreement has been terminated pursuant to
ARTICLE IX hereof or unless another time or date is agreed to in writing by
the Parties hereto. The Closing shall be held at the offices of Sheppard
Mullin Richter and Hampton LLP, 379 Lytton Avenue, Palo Alto, California 94301,
unless another place is agreed to in writing by the Parties hereto, and the
actual date of the Closing is hereinafter referred to as the " _Closing
Date_." __

 

 __1.3 _Effective Time_ __. On the Closing Date, the Parties shall (a) cause
an agreement of merger satisfying the applicable requirements of the
California Law and otherwise in substantially the form attached hereto as
_Exhibit A_ , but subject to any changes as may be required by the Secretary
of State of the State of California and agreed to by Parent and the Company
(the " _Agreement of Merger_ ") to be duly executed by the Company and Merger
Sub and filed with the Secretary of State of the State of California as soon
as practicable on the Closing Date, together with the officers certificate
required by the California Law, and (b) make any other filings, recordings or
publications required to be made by the Company or Merger Sub under the
California Law in connection with the Merger. The Merger shall become
effective at such time as the Agreement of Merger is duly filed and accepted
by the Secretary of State of the State of California or on such later date and
time as shall be agreed to by the Company and Parent and specified in
the Agreement of Merger (such date and time being hereinafter referred to as
the " _Effective Time_ "). __

 



-6- 1.4 _Effects of the Merger_. The Merger shall have the effects set
forth herein and in the applicable provisions of the California Law. Without
limiting the generality of the foregoing, and subject thereto, from and after
the Effective Time, all property, rights, privileges, immunities, powers,
franchises, licenses and authority of the Company and Merger Sub shall vest
in the Surviving Corporation, and all debts, liabilities, obligations,
restrictions and duties of each of the Company and Merger Sub shall become the
debts, liabilities, obligations, restrictions and duties of the Surviving
Corporation.

1.5 _Governing Documents_. The Company Articles shall, by virtue of
the Merger, be amended and restated so as to read in its entirety in the form
attached hereto as _Exhibit B_ and, as so amended and restated, shall be the
articles of incorporation of the Surviving Corporation until thereafter
changed or amended as provided therein or by applicable Law. The Company
Bylaws shall, by virtue of the Merger, be amended and restated to conform to
the bylaws of Merger Sub, as in effect immediately prior to the Effective
Time, and as such shall be the bylaws of the Surviving Corporation until
thereafter changed or amended as provided therein or by applicable Law.

1.6 _Directors and Officers of the Surviving Corporation_. The Parties shall
take all actions necessary so that (a) the directors of Merger Sub at the
Effective Time shall, from and after the Effective Time, be the directors of
the Surviving Corporation until their successors shall have been duly elected
or appointed and qualified or until their earlier death, resignation or
removal in accordance with the articles of incorporation and bylaws of the
Surviving Corporation, and (b) the officers of Merger Sub at the Effective
Time shall, from and after the Effective Time, be the officers of the
Surviving Corporation until their successors shall have been duly elected or
appointed and qualified or until their earlier death, resignation or removal
in accordance with the articles of incorporation and bylaws of the Surviving
Corporation.

ARTICLE II

 

 _Effect of Merger on Company Securities_

 

2.1 _Effect on Capital Stock_.

 

(a) _Merger Consideration_. At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and
without any action on the part of the Parties or holders of any securities of
the Parties, subject to Section 2.1(d), each share of Company Common Stock
issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (excluding
Company Shares to be cancelled in accordance with Section 2.1(b) and any
Dissenting Shares) shall be automatically converted into the right to receive
$17.00 in cash, without interest (the " _Merger Consideration_ "). From and
after the Effective Time, all such Company Shares shall no longer be
outstanding and shall automatically be cancelled and shall cease to exist, and
each applicable holder of such Company Shares shall cease to have any rights
with respect thereto, except the right to receive the Merger Consideration
therefor upon the surrender of such Company Shares in accordance with Section
2.2.

 



-7- (b) _Cancellation of Company Common Stock_. At the Effective Time,
all Company Shares owned by the Company, Parent, Merger Sub or by any of
their respective direct or indirect wholly owned Subsidiaries shall be
cancelled and shall cease to exist, and no consideration shall be delivered in
exchange therefor.

 

(c) _Treatment of Merger Sub Common Stock_. At the Effective Time, each issued
and outstanding share of common stock, without par value per share, of Merger
Sub shall be automatically converted into and become one fully paid and
nonassessable share of common stock of the Surviving Corporation and shall
constitute the only outstanding shares of capital stock of the Surviving
Corporation.

(d) _Adjustment to Merger Consideration_. The Merger Consideration shall be
adjusted appropriately, without duplication, to reflect the effect of any
stock split, reverse stock split, stock dividend (including any dividend or
distribution of securities convertible into Company Common Stock),
reorganization, recapitalization, reclassification, combination, exchange of
shares or other like change with respect to the shares of Company Common Stock
outstanding after the date hereof and prior to the Effective Time so as to
provide Parent and the holder of Company Shares the same economic effect as
contemplated by this Agreement prior to such event; provided, however, that
nothing in this Section 2.1(d) shall be construed to permit the Company or any
of its Subsidiaries to take any action with respect to its securities that is
prohibited by the terms of this Agreement.

2.2 _Payment for Securities; Surrender of Certificates_

(a) _Paying Agent Fund_. Prior to the Effective Time, Parent or Merger Sub
shall designate a bank or trust company reasonably acceptable to the Company
to act as the paying agent in connection with the Merger (the " _Paying Agent_
"). The Paying Agent shall also act as the agent for the Companys
shareholders for the purpose of receiving and holding their Certificates and
Book-Entry Shares and shall obtain no rights or interests in the shares
represented thereby. At or prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall deposit,
or cause to be deposited, with the Paying Agent cash in immediately available
funds in an amount sufficient to pay the aggregate Merger Consideration
payable to all holders of Company Common Stock (including Company Common Stock
to be issued prior to the Effective Time in accordance with Section 2.4)
(such cash amount, the " _Paying Agent Fund_ "), in each case, for the sole
benefit of the holders of shares of Company Common Stock. In the event the
Paying Agent Fund shall be insufficient to pay the aggregate Merger
Consideration, Parent shall, or shall cause Merger Sub to, promptly deposit
additional funds with the Paying Agent in an amount which is equal to the
deficiency in the amount required to make such payment. Parent shall cause the
Paying Agent to make, and the Paying Agent shall make, delivery of the Merger
Consideration, out of the Paying Agent Fund in accordance with this Agreement.

 



-8- (b) _Procedures for Surrender_. Promptly after the Effective Time (and in any
event, within three (3) Business Days thereafter), Parent shall, and shall
cause the Surviving Corporation to, cause the Paying Agent to mail (and make
available for collection by hand) to each holder of record of a certificate
or certificates which immediately prior to the Effective Time represented
outstanding Company Shares (the " _Certificates_ ") or non-certificated
Company Shares represented by book-entry (" _Book-Entry Shares_ ") and whose
Company Shares were converted pursuant to Section 2.1 into the right to
receive the Merger Consideration (i) a letter of transmittal, which shall
specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to
the Certificates shall pass, only upon delivery of the Certificates (or
affidavits of loss in lieu thereof) to the Paying Agent and shall be in such
form and have such other provisions as Parent may reasonably specify and (ii)
instructions for effecting the surrender of the Certificates (or affidavits
of loss in lieu thereof) or Book-Entry Shares in exchange for payment of the
Merger Consideration payable in respect of such Company Shares pursuant to
Section 2.1. Upon surrender of a Certificate (or an affidavit of loss in lieu
thereof) or Book-Entry Share for cancellation to the Paying Agent or to such
other agent or agents as may be appointed by Parent or the Surviving
Corporation, together with such letter of transmittal duly completed and
validly executed in accordance with the instructions thereto, and such other
documents as may be required pursuant to such instructions, the holder of such
Certificate or Book-Entry Share shall be entitled to receive in
exchange therefor the applicable Merger Consideration pursuant to the
provisions of this ARTICLE II for each Company Share formerly represented by
such Certificate or Book-Entry Share. All such amounts shall be mailed (or
made available for collection by hand if so elected by the surrendering
holder) within five (5) Business Days following the Paying Agents receipt of
such Certificate (or affidavit of loss in lieu thereof) or Book-Entry Share,
letter of transmittal and such other documents, and the Certificate (or
affidavit of loss in lieu thereof) or Book-Entry Share so surrendered shall be
forthwith cancelled. The Paying Agent shall accept such Certificates (or
affidavits of loss in lieu thereof) or Book-Entry Shares upon compliance with
such reasonable terms and conditions as the Paying Agent may impose to effect
an orderly exchange thereof in accordance with normal exchange practices. If
payment of the Merger Consideration is to be made to a Person other than
the Person in whose name the surrendered Certificate is registered, it shall
be a condition precedent to payment that (A) the Certificate so surrendered
shall be properly endorsed or shall be otherwise in proper form for transfer
and (B) the Person requesting such payment shall have paid any transfer and
other similar Taxes required by reason of the payment of the Merger
Consideration to a Person other than the registered holder of the Certificate
surrendered or shall have established to the satisfaction of the Paying Agent
that such Tax either has been paid or is not payable. Any other transfer or
similar Taxes incurred in connection with the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement shall be paid by Parent. Payment of the applicable Merger
Consideration with respect to Book-Entry Shares shall only be made to the
Person in whose name such Book-Entry Shares are registered. Until surrendered
as contemplated by this Section 2.2, each Certificate and Book-Entry
Share shall be deemed at any time after the Effective Time to represent only
the right to receive the applicable Merger Consideration as contemplated by
this ARTICLE II, without interest thereon.

 

(c) _Transfer Books; No Further Ownership Rights in Company Shares_. At the
Effective Time, the stock transfer books of the Company shall be closed and
thereafter there shall be no further registrations of transfers of Company
Shares on the records of the Company, other than registrations of transfers to
reflect, in accordance with customary settlement 

 



-9-  procedures, trades effected prior to the Effective Time. From and after the
Effective Time, the holders of Certificates outstanding immediately prior to
the Effective Time shall cease to have any rights with respect to such
Company Shares except as otherwise provided for herein or by applicable Law.
If, after the Effective Time, Certificates or Book-Entry Shares are presented
to the Surviving Corporation for any reason, they shall be cancelled and
exchanged as provided in this Agreement.

(d) _Termination of Paying Agent Fund; No Liability_. At any time following
twelve (12) months after the Effective Time, Parent shall be entitled to
require the Paying Agent to deliver to it any funds (including any interest
received with respect thereto) remaining in the Paying Agent Fund that have
not been disbursed, or for which disbursement is pending subject only to the
Paying Agents routine administrative procedures, to holders of Certificates
or Book-Entry Shares, and thereafter such holders shall be entitled to look
only to the Surviving Corporation and Parent (subject to abandoned property,
escheat or other similar Laws) as general creditors thereof with respect to
the applicable Merger Consideration, payable upon due surrender of their
Certificates or Book-Entry Shares and compliance with the procedures in
Section 2.2(b), without any interest thereon. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
none of the Surviving Corporation, Parent or the Paying Agent shall be liable
to any holder of a Certificate or Book-Entry Share for any Merger
Consideration or other amounts delivered to a public official pursuant to any
applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar Law.

 

(e) _Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates_. In the event that any
Certificates shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, the Paying Agent
shall issue in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificates, upon
the making of an affidavit of that fact by the holder thereof and, if required
by Parent or the Paying Agent, the posting by such holder of a bond in such
amount as Parent may determine is reasonably necessary as indemnity against
any claim that may be made against it or the Surviving Corporation with
respect to any such Certificates, the applicable Merger Consideration payable
in respect thereof pursuant to Section 2.1 hereof.

2.3 _Dissenters  Rights_.

 

 __(a) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, Company
Shares, if any, as to which the holder thereof shall have (i) properly
demanded that the Company purchase such Company Shares for fair market value
in accordance with, and otherwise complied with, the provisions of Chapter 13
of the California Law (" _Chapter 13_ ") and (ii) not effectively withdrawn
or lost such holders rights to demand purchase for such Company Shares for
fair market value pursuant to Chapter 13 (each, a " _Dissenting Share_ "),
shall not be converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration
payable pursuant to Section 2.1, but instead at the Effective Time shall
become entitled only to payment of the fair value of such Company Shares
determined in accordance with Chapter 13 (it being understood and
acknowledged that at the Effective Time, such Dissenting Shares shall no
longer be outstanding, shall automatically be cancelled and shall cease to
exist, and such holder shall cease to have any rights with respect thereto
other than the right to receive the fair value of such Dissenting Shares as
determined in accordance with Chapter 13); _provided_ , _however_ , that if
any such holder shall fail to perfect or otherwise shall waive, withdraw or
lose the right to payment of the fair value of such Dissenting Shares under
Chapter 13, then the right of such holder to be paid the fair value of such
holders Dissenting Shares shall cease and such Dissenting Shares shall be
deemed to have been converted as of the Effective Time into, and to have
become exchangeable solely for the right to receive, without interest or
duplication, the Merger Consideration. __

 



-10- (b) The Company shall give prompt notice to Parent of any demands received by
the Company for the purchase of any Company Shares pursuant to Chapter 13, of
any withdrawals of such demands and of any other instruments served and
received by the Company under Chapter 13, and Parent shall have the
opportunity to participate in all negotiations and proceedings with respect
to such demands. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall not, without
the prior written consent of Parent (such consent not to be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned or delayed), make any payment with respect to, or
settle or compromise or offer to settle or compromise, any such demand, or
agree to do any of the foregoing.

 

2.4 _Treatment of Company Equity Awards_.

 

 __(a) All options to acquire shares of Company Common Stock (the " _Company

Amended and Restated 2001 Stock Incentive Plan (as amended), the
Companys Amended and Restated 2004 Stock Incentive Plan, the Companys 2014
Stock Award and Incentive Compensation Plan, or any other equity plan,
agreement or arrangement other than the Company ESPP (as defined below)
(collectively, the " _Company Stock Plans_ ") prior to the Effective Time,
which are outstanding as of the Capitalization Date, are set forth in Section
2.4(a) of the Company Disclosure Schedule, together with the holders name,
the date of grant, the type of award, the number of Company Shares originally
granted and number of outstanding shares subject to the Company Equity Award,
the vesting schedule, any expiration date, and any per Company Share exercise
price or purchase price.  __

__(b) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company Board (or, if appropriate, any
committee thereof) will adopt resolutions and take all other actions
necessary and appropriate to provide that, immediately prior to the Effective
Time, (i) each unexpired and unexercised Company Option which is vested as of
the Effective Time (the " _Vested Options_ ") will be cancelled and, in
exchange therefor, each former holder of any such cancelled Vested Option will
only be entitled to receive, in consideration of the cancellation of such
Vested Option and in full settlement therefor, a payment in cash of an amount
equal to the product of (A) the total number of unexercised Company Shares
subject to such Vested Option as of the time of cancellation of the Company
Option (the " _Vested Unexercised Shares_ "), and (B) the excess, if any, of
the Merger Consideration over the exercise price per Vested Unexercised Share
(such amounts payable hereunder being referred to as the " _Option Payments_
"); and (ii) each unexpired and unexercised Company Option which is not
vested as of the Effective Time (the " _Unvested Options_ ") and which is held
by an individual who is rendering continuous service to the Company or
its Subsidiaries through the Effective Time and who is eligible to be
included on a registration statement filed by Parent on Form S-8 will be
canceled and replaced by Parent and become an award of restricted stock units
covering shares of Parent Stock (" _Parent RSUs_ ") issued under the Parent
Stock Plan, on generally the same terms and conditions (including the
applicable vesting requirements and the terms and conditions set forth on
Section 2.4(b) of the _ _

 



-11-  Company Disclosure Schedule) as applied to each such Unvested Option
immediately prior to the Effective Time, except that each such Parent RSU
award shall cover that whole number of shares of Parent Stock (rounded down)
equal to the product of (A) the total number of unexercised Company Shares
subject to such Unvested Option as of the time of cancellation of the Unvested
Option multiplied by (B) the excess, if any, of the Merger Consideration over
the exercise price per unexercised share subject to such Unvested Option and
then divided by (C) the VWAP of Parent Stock and (iii) each Unvested Option
held by an individual who is rendering continuous service to the Company or
its Subsidiaries through the Effective Time but who is not eligible to be
included on a registration statement filed by Parent on Form S-8 will vest as
of immediately prior to the Effective Time and be treated as a Vested Option.
Upon the terms set forth herein, the new award issued in exchange for the
Unvested Options shall be made pursuant to Parents form of stock option or
restricted stock unit agreement as applicable. From and after the Effective
Time, any such cancelled Company Option will no longer be exercisable by the
former holder thereof.

__(c) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company Board (or, if appropriate, any
committee thereof) will adopt resolutions and take all other actions necessary
and appropriate to provide that, immediately prior to the Effective Time, (i)
each outstanding award of restricted stock units or performance share units
granted pursuant to any Company Stock Plan which is vested as of the Effective
Time (the " _Vested Company RSUs_ "), will be cancelled in exchange for the
right to receive a payment equal to the Merger Consideration and the amount
of any declared but unpaid dividends with respect to such Vested Company RSU;
___provided_ __, __ _however_ __, that, for the avoidance of doubt, no holder
of a Vested Company RSU shall be entitled to any payment whatsoever in respect
of the August 2015 Dividend (such amounts payable hereunder being referred to
as the " _Vested RSU Payments_ "), (ii) each outstanding award of restricted
stock units or performance share units granted pursuant to any Company Stock
Plan which is not vested prior to the Effective Time (the " _Unvested Company
RSUs_ " and, together with the Vested Company RSUs, the " _Company RSUs_ ")
that is held by an individual who is rendering continuous service to the
Company or its Subsidiaries through the Effective Time and who is eligible to
be included on a registration statement filed by Parent on Form S-8 will be
canceled and replaced by Parent and become a Parent RSU issued under the
Parent Stock Plan, on generally the same terms and conditions (including
applicable vesting requirements (other than performance-vesting requirements
which will be deemed satisfied at "maximum" achievement) and deferral
provisions) as applied to each such Unvested Company RSU immediately prior to
the Effective Time, with respect to the number of shares of Parent
Stock, rounded down to the nearest whole share of Parent Stock, that is equal
to the product of the number of shares of Company Common Stock that were
subject to such Unvested Company RSU immediately prior to the Effective Time
multiplied by the quotient obtained by dividing (x) the Merger Consideration
by (y) the VWAP of Parent Stock; and (iii) each Unvested Company RSU held by
an individual who is rendering continuous service to the Company or its
Subsidiaries through the Effective Time but who is not eligible to be
included on a registration statement filed by Parent on Form S-8 will vest
(treating for this purposes any performance-based vesting condition to which
such Company RSU is subject as having been attained at "maximum" level) and
be cancelled in exchange for the right to the right to receive a payment equal
to the Merger Consideration (such amounts payable hereunder, together with the
Vested RSU Payments, the " _RSU Payments_ "). Upon the terms set forth
herein, the new award issued in exchange for the Unvested Company RSUs shall
be made pursuant to Parents form of restricted stock unit grant agreement. __

 



-12- (d) Parent shall, to the extent legally required, file, no later than the
Closing Date, a registration statement on Form S-8 (or any successor or other
appropriate form) under the Securities Act to register shares of Parent Stock
issuable pursuant to Section 2.4(c).

 

(e) Any Option Payment or RSU Payment to which a current or former employee of
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries becomes entitled pursuant Section
2.4(b) or Section 2.4(c) shall be made through the Surviving Corporations
payroll on the next regularly scheduled payroll after the Effective Time, in
the case of the Vested RSU Payments, and on the next regularly scheduled
payroll after each vesting event, in the case of the Unvested RSU Payments.

(f) As of the Effective Time, all Company Stock Plans will be terminated, and
no further Company Options, Company RSUs or other rights with respect to
Company Shares will be granted thereunder.

 

 __(g) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company s 2010 Employee Stock
Purchase Plan, as amended (the " _Company ESPP_ ") shall be terminated and no
further options or other rights with respect to Company Shares will be granted
thereunder. The rights of participants in the Company ESPP with respect to any
offering period then underway under such Company ESPP shall be determined by
treating the last Business Day prior to, or if more administratively
advisable, the last payroll date of the Company immediately prior to, the
Effective Time or such earlier date as the Company ESPP administrator may
determine as permitted under the terms of the Company ESPP (the " _Final
Exercise Date_ "), as the last day of such offering period and by making such
other pro-rata adjustments as may be necessary to reflect the shortened
offering period but otherwise treating such shortened offering period as a
fully effective and completed offering period for all purposes under the
Company ESPP. On the Final Exercise Date, the funds credited as of such
date under the Company ESPP within the associated accumulated payroll
withholding account for each participant under the Company ESPP shall be used
to purchase Company Shares in accordance with the terms of the Company ESPP,
and each Company Share purchased thereunder immediately prior to the
Effective Time shall be cancelled at the Effective Time and converted into the
right to receive the Merger Consideration in accordance with Section 2.1. __

 

(h) The Company shall take all actions necessary to effect the provisions set
forth in this Section 2.4, including without limitation any necessary
amendments to any Contracts or other instruments and the delivery of all
required notice, as applicable.

 

2.5 _Withholding_. Each of Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall be
entitled to deduct and withhold, or cause the Paying Agent to deduct and
withhold, from the consideration otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement
to any holder of Shares and from any payments under Section 2.4 such amounts
as Parent, Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent is required to deduct
and withhold with respect to the making of such payment under the Code, or any
other

 



-13-  applicable state, local or foreign Tax Law. Except for U.S. federal backup
withholding and regular payroll withholding associated with payments under
Section 2.4, before making any such deduction or withholding, Parent or the
Surviving Corporation, as applicable, shall give the Company notice of the
intention to make such deduction or withholding, and such notice, which shall
include the authority, basis and method of calculation for the proposed
deduction or withholding, shall be given at least a commercially reasonable
period of time before such deduction or withholding is required, in order for
the Company to obtain reduction of or relief from such deduction
or withholding. To the extent that amounts are so withheld and timely
remitted to the appropriate Governmental Entity, such withheld amounts shall
be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the
Person in respect of which such deduction and withholding was made.

(c) The execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement by the Company

-16-  failure to make or obtain would not reasonably be expected to have,
individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on the Company or
materially delay or impede the Closing. The Company has no secured creditors
whose approval of the Merger is required under the Laws of the State of
California.

3.5  _Company Reports; Financial Statements_.

__(a) The Company has filed or furnished, as applicable, on a timely basis,
all forms, statements, certifications, reports and documents required to be
filed or furnished by it with the SEC pursuant to the Exchange Act or the
Securities Act since June 30, 2014 (the " _Applicable Date_ " and the forms,
statements, reports and documents filed or furnished since the Applicable Date
and those filed or furnished subsequent to the date of the Agreement,
including any amendments or supplements thereto, the " _Company Reports_ ").
No Subsidiary of the Company is required to file or furnish any periodic
reports with the SEC. Each of the Company Reports, at the time of its filing
or being furnished complied or, if not yet filed or furnished, will comply
when filed or furnished, in all material respects with the applicable
requirements of the Securities Act, the Exchange Act, applicable accounting
standards and the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (as amended and including the
rules and regulations promulgated thereunder), and any rules and regulations
promulgated thereunder applicable to the Company Reports. As of their
respective dates (or, if amended prior to the date of the Agreement, as of the
date of such amendment), the Company Reports did not, and any Company Reports
filed with or furnished to the SEC subsequent to the date of the Agreement
will not, contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a
material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the
statements made therein, in light of the circumstances in which they were
made, not misleading, except to the extent corrected by a subsequently filed
Company Report prior to the date hereof. __

 

(b) The Company maintains internal control over financial reporting (as
defined in Rule 13a-15 or 15d-15, as applicable, under the Exchange Act) that
are designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of
financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external
purposes in accordance with U.S. GAAP and includes policies and
procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable
detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the
assets of the Company, (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are
recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in
accordance with U.S. GAAP, and that receipts and expenditures of the Company
are being made in accordance with authorizations of management and directors
of the Company, and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention
or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the
Companys assets that could have a material effect on its financial
statements.

 

(c) Each of the consolidated balance sheets included in or incorporated by
reference into the Company Reports (including the related notes and
schedules) fairly presents, or, in the case of Company Reports filed after the
date of the Agreement, will fairly present, in all material respects, the
consolidated financial position of the Company and its
consolidated Subsidiaries as of its date, and each of the consolidated
statements of income, changes in shareholders equity and cash flows included
in or incorporated by reference into the Company Reports (including any
related notes and schedules) fairly presents, or in the case of Company

 



-17-  Reports filed after the date of the Agreement, will fairly present, in all
material respects, the results of operations, changes in shareholders equity
and cash flows, as the case may be, of the Company and its consolidated
Subsidiaries for the periods set forth therein (subject, in the case of
unaudited interim statements, to normal year-end audit adjustments and the
exclusion of certain notes in accordance with the rules of the SEC relating
to unaudited financial statements), in each case in accordance with U.S. GAAP,
Regulation S-X and the rules and standards of the Public Company Accounting
Oversight Board except as may be noted therein.

 

(d) The Company has implemented disclosure controls and procedures (as defined
in Rule 13a-15(e) of the Exchange Act) that are reasonably designed to ensure
that material information relating to the Company, including its Subsidiaries,
required to be included in reports filed under the Exchange Act is made known
to the chief executive officer and chief financial officer of the Company or
other Persons performing similar functions by others within those entities.
Neither the Company nor, to the Companys Knowledge, the Companys independent
registered public accounting firm has identified or been made aware of
"significant deficiencies" or "material weaknesses" (as defined by the Public
Company Account Oversight Board) in the design or operation of the Companys
internal controls and procedures which are reasonably likely to adversely
affect the Companys ability to record, process, summarize and report
financial data, in each case which has not been subsequently remediated. To
the Companys Knowledge, there is no fraud, whether or not material, that
involves the Companys management or other employees who have a significant
role in the internal control over financial reporting utilized by the Company
and its Subsidiaries.

 

3.6 _Absence of Certain Changes or Events_. Except as disclosed in the Company
Reports, from the Company Balance Sheet Date to the date of this Agreement,
the Company and its Subsidiaries have conducted their respective businesses
only in the ordinary course (except for the execution and performance of this
Agreement and the discussions, negotiations and transactions related thereto)
and during such period there has not been any event, occurrence, development
or state of circumstances or facts that has had or would reasonably be
expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect
on the Company.

3.7 _No Undisclosed Liabilities_. Neither the Company nor any of its
Subsidiaries has any material obligations or liabilities of a type (matured
or unmatured, fixed or contingent, including any obligations to issue capital
stock or other securities of the Company) required to be reflected on the face
of a consolidated balance sheet of the Company prepared in accordance with
U.S. GAAP due after the date of the Agreement, other than (a) those set forth
or adequately provided for in the Company Balance Sheet, (b) those incurred in
the ordinary course of business since the Company Balance Sheet date, (c)
those that would not reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the
aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on the Company and (d) those incurred in
connection with or arising as a result of the negotiation or execution of
this Agreement or consummation of the Transactions.

__3.8  _Litigation_ __. To the Knowledge of the Company, as of the date of
the Agreement, there is no private or governmental action, suit, inquiry,
notice of violation, claim, arbitration, audit, proceeding (including any
partial proceeding such as a deposition) or investigation (" _Action_ ")
pending or threatened in writing against the Company, any of its officers or
directors __

 



-18-  (in their capacities as such), any of its Subsidiaries or any of their
properties, before or by any Governmental Entity which (a) challenges the
legality, validity or enforceability of this Agreement or (b) would, if there
were an unfavorable decision, have or reasonably be expected to result in,
individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on the Company. To
the Knowledge of the Company, as of the date of the Agreement, there is no
Judgment imposed upon the Company, any of its officers or directors

(in their capacities as such), any of its Subsidiaries or any of their
respective properties, that would prevent, enjoin, alter or materially delay
any of the Transactions, or that would reasonably be expected to have a
Material Adverse Effect on the Company. To the Knowledge of the Company, as
of the date of the Agreement, neither the Company, any of its Subsidiaries nor
any director or officer thereof (in his or her capacity as such), is or has
been the subject of any Action involving a claim or violation of or
liability under the securities Laws of any Governmental Entity or a claim of
breach of fiduciary duty.

3.9 _Licenses, Permits, Etc_. The Company and its Subsidiaries possess or
will possess prior to the Closing all Company Material Permits, and all such
Company Material Permits are in full force and effect. True, complete and
correct copies of the Company Material Permits issued to the Company and its
Subsidiaries have previously been delivered to, or made available to, Parent.
Unless otherwise stipulated herein or disclosed in the Company Reports, the
Company, its Subsidiaries and each of their respective officers, directors,
employees, representatives and agents (in each case, in their capacity as such
and to the extent required to comply with the terms of such Company Material
Permits) have complied with all terms of such Company Material Permits except
where instances of such noncompliance have not had and would not reasonably be
expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect
on the Company. To the Knowledge of the Company, neither the Company nor any
of its Subsidiaries is in default under any of such Company Material Permits
and no event has occurred and no condition exists which, with the giving of
notice or the passage of time, or both, would constitute a default thereunder,
except, in each case, for any such default that would not reasonably be
expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect
on the Company. Neither the execution and delivery of this Agreement, the
Transaction Documents or any of the other documents contemplated hereby or
thereby nor the consummation of the Transactions or compliance by the Company
and its Subsidiaries with any of the provisions hereof or thereof will result
in any suspension, revocation, impairment, forfeiture or nonrenewal of any
Company Material Permit applicable to the business of the Company and its
Subsidiaries.

3.10 _Title to Properties_.

__(a) _Real Property_. The Company has made available to Parent (i) an
accurate and complete list of all real properties with respect to which the
Company directly or indirectly holds a valid leasehold interest as well as any
other real estate that is in the possession of or leased by the Company and
its Subsidiaries (collectively, the " _Real Property_ "), and (ii) copies of
all leases under which any such Real Property is possessed (the " _Real Estate
Leases_ "). Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries is in default
under any of the Real Estate Leases, except where such defaults have not had
and would not be reasonably expected to have, individually or in the
aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on the Company, and to the Knowledge of
the Company, there is no default by any of the lessors thereunder. The
Company or the applicable Subsidiary of the Company has good and marketable
fee simple title to all of the Real Property owned by the Company or such
Subsidiary of the Company, in each case free and clear of all Liens (other
than Permitted Liens). __

in possession of and have good title to, or have valid leasehold interests in
or valid contractual rights to use all material tangible personal property
used in the conduct of their business, including the material tangible
personal property reflected in the Company Financial Statements and material
tangible personal property acquired since the Company Balance Sheet Date
(collectively, the " _Tangible Personal Property_ "). All Tangible Personal
Property is free and clear of all Liens, other than Permitted Liens, and is
in a condition materially adequate and suitable for the purposes for which it
is presently being used, subject to reasonable ordinary wear and tear except,
in each case, which, individually or in the aggregate, has not resulted and
would not reasonably be expected to result in a Material Adverse Effect on the
Company. Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has granted any
lease, sublease, tenancy or license of any portion of the Tangible Personal
Property for which the annual rental payments exceed $100,000. For clarity and
notwithstanding the foregoing, no representations or warranties with respect

schedule delivered to the Company by Parent on the date of the Agreement (the
" _Parent Disclosure Schedule_ "), Parent and Merger Sub hereby represent and
warrant to the Company that: __

 

4.1 _Organization and Good Standing_. Each of Parent and its Subsidiaries is a
legal entity duly organized, validly existing and in good standing under the
Laws of its respective jurisdiction of organization. Each of the Parent and
its Subsidiaries has all requisite corporate or similar power and authority to
own, lease and operate its properties and assets and to carry on its business
as presently conducted under the Laws of the place of its establishment or
incorporation and is qualified to do business and in good standing as a
foreign corporation or other legal entity under the Laws of the places
where the ownership, leasing or operation of its assets or properties or
conduct of its business requires such qualification, except, in the case of
any of the foregoing, where the failure to be so qualified or in good
standing, or to have such power or authority, would not reasonably be
expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect
on Parent.

 

4.2 _Corporate Authority and Approval_. Each of Parent and Merger Sub has full
corporate power and authority and has taken all corporate action necessary in
order to execute, deliver and perform its obligations under this Agreement and
to consummate the Merger and the Transactions contemplated hereby in
accordance with the terms hereof. This Agreement has been duly executed and
delivered by Parent and Merger Sub and, assuming due authorization, execution
and delivery hereof by the Company, constitutes a valid and binding agreement
of Parent and Merger Sub enforceable against Parent and Merger Sub
in accordance with its terms, subject to the Enforceability Exceptions.

4.3 _Non-Contravention_. The execution, delivery and performance of this
Agreement by Parent and Merger Sub do not, and the consummation by the Merger
Sub of the Merger and the other Transactions contemplated hereby will not,
constitute or result in (A) a breach or violation of, or a default under, any
provision (x) of the certificate of incorporation and bylaws of Parent and (y)
the articles of incorporation or bylaws of Merger Sub, (B) a breach or
violation of, assuming (solely with respect to performance of this Agreement
and consummation of the Merger and the other Transactions contemplated hereby)
that the matters referred to in Section 4.4 are complied with, any Law to
which Parent or Merger Sub is subject, (C) a default under any of the terms,

obligations under any such Contract or require any Consent under any such
Contract, (D) the creation of any Lien (other than a Permitted Lien) on any
properties or assets of Parent or Merger Sub, except, in the case of clause

creation or acceleration that would not reasonably be expected to have,
individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on Parent.

requirements of the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations promulgated
thereunder or any other applicable U.S. state or federal securities, takeover
or "blue sky" Laws, (B) compliance with any applicable rules of NASDAQ, (C)

-31-  Secretary of State of the State of California pursuant to the California
Law, and (D) if applicable, any required Consent or approval of, or filing
with any applicable Governmental Antitrust Entity, no Consent or approval of,
or filing, license, Permit or authorization, declaration or registration with,
any Governmental Entity necessary for the execution and delivery of this
Agreement by Parent or Merger Sub, the performance by Parent and Merger Sub
of their obligations hereunder and the consummation by Parent and Merger Sub
of the Transactions, except for those that the failure to make or obtain are
not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably likely to affect adversely
the ability of Parent and Merger Sub to consummate the Transactions.

4.5 _Litigation_. To the Knowledge of Parent, there is no Action pending or
threatened in writing against or affecting Parent or Merger Sub, any of their
officers or directors (in their capacities as such), any of their Subsidiaries
or any of their properties, before or by any Governmental Entity which (a)
challenges the legality, validity or enforceability of this Agreement or (b)
would, if there were an unfavorable decision, have or reasonably be expected
to result in, individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on
Parent. To the Knowledge of Parent and Merger Sub, there is no Judgment
imposed upon Parent or Merger Sub, any of their officers or directors (in
their capacities as such), any of their Subsidiaries or any of their
respective properties, that would prevent, enjoin, alter or materially delay
any of the Transactions, or that would reasonably be expected to have a
Material Adverse Effect on Parent or affect adversely the ability of Parent
and Merger Sub to consummate the Transactions. To the Knowledge of Parent, as
of the date of the Agreement, neither Parent, any of its Subsidiaries nor any
director or officer thereof (in his or her capacity as such), is or has been
the subject of any Action involving a claim or violation of or liability
under the securities Laws of any Governmental Entity or a claim of breach of
fiduciary duty.

4.6 _Information Supplied_. The information relating to Parent and its
Subsidiaries to be contained in the Proxy Statement will not, on the date the
Proxy Statement (and any amendment or supplement thereto) is first mailed to
the shareholders of the Company, or at the time of the Company Shareholder
Meeting (as it may be adjourned or postponed in accordance with the terms
hereof), contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any
material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the
statements therein, at the time and in the light of the circumstances under
which they were made, not misleading. The Proxy Statement (other than the
portions thereof relating solely to the meeting of the shareholders of
the Company) will comply as to form in all material respects with the
provisions of the Exchange Act, the rules and regulations promulgated
thereunder and any other applicable federal securities Laws. Notwithstanding
the foregoing provisions of this Section 4.6, no representation or warranty
is made by Parent or Merger Sub with respect to information or statements made
or incorporated by reference in the Proxy Statement which were based on
information supplied by or on behalf of the Company, or otherwise not
supplied by or on behalf of Parent.

__4.7 _Credit Agreement_ __. Parent has provided to the Company a fully
executed copy of that certain Amendment No. 3 to Credit Agreement,
Incremental Term Assumption Agreement, Limited Waiver and Consent, dated as of
the date hereof (the " _Credit Agreement Amendment_ ", and the credit
facilities thereby amended, the " _Credit Agreement_ "), by and among Parent,
the __

therein and the administrative agent identified therein. The Third Amendment

no conditions to the availability of Loans under the Credit Agreement or
Credit Agreement Amendment except as referred to therein. The Credit Agreement
Amendment has been duly executed and delivered by Parent and its Subsidiaries
party thereto (the " _Specified Subsidiaries_ ") and, assuming the due
authorization, execution and delivery thereof by the other parties thereto,
constitutes a valid and binding agreement of Parent and the Specified
Subsidiaries enforceable against Parent and the Specified Subsidiaries in
accordance with its terms, subject to the Enforceability Exceptions. For the
avoidance of doubt, Parents receipt of financing contemplated by the Credit
Agreement Amendment and the Credit Agreement or otherwise shall not be a
condition to the Closing. __

 

4.8 _Ownership of Company Common Stock_. Neither Parent nor any of its
Subsidiaries owns (beneficially or otherwise) any Shares or other equity
interests in the Company or any options, warrants or other rights to acquire
Company Common Stock or other equity interests in the Company (or any other
economic interest through derivative securities or otherwise in the Company).

4.9 _Management Arrangements_. As of the date hereof, except as previously
disclosed to the Company, none of Parent or Merger Sub, or, to the Knowledge
of Parent, their respective executive officers, directors or Affiliates, has
entered into any agreement, arrangement or understanding with any of the
executive officers, directors or Affiliates of the Company that is currently
in effect or would become effective in the future (upon consummation of the
Merger or otherwise) and that would be required to be disclosed under Item
1005(d) of Regulation M-A under the Exchange Act.

 

4.10 _WARN Act_. Parent and Merger Sub are neither planning nor contemplating,
and Parent and Merger Sub have neither made nor taken, any decisions or
actions concerning the employees of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
after the Closing that would require, prior to the Effective Time, the service
of notice under the Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification Act or
similar local Laws.

4.11 _Brokers_. Other than Bank of America Merrill Lynch, neither
Parent, Merger Sub nor any of their respective stockholders, directors,
officers, employees or affiliates, has incurred or will incur on behalf of
Parent, Merger Sub or any Parent Subsidiary, any brokerage, finders, advisory
or similar fee in connection with the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement.

4.12 _Operations of Merger Sub_. Parent is the sole shareholder of Merger
Sub, which was formed solely for the purpose of engaging in the Merger. Since
its date of formation, Merger Sub has not carried on any business or conducted
any other operations other than the execution of this Agreement,
the performance of its obligations hereunder and matters ancillary thereto.

likely to jeopardize the protection of attorney-client privilege or contravene
any Law (it being agreed that the Parties shall use their commercially

conditions to the obligations of the other parties hereunder to be
satisfied and to consummate the Transactions, including making all necessary
filings (including filings under the HSR Act) with any Government Antitrust
Entity, and obtaining all necessary waivers, clearances, Consents and
approvals from, and taking all steps to avoid any Action or proceeding by,
any Government Antitrust Entity.

__(e) To the extent required, each of the Parties will use its commercially
reasonable efforts to promptly prepare and file, or cause to be promptly
prepared and filed, with the appropriate Government Antitrust Entity not later
than ten (10) Business Days after the date of this Agreement (unless
otherwise mutually agreed among the Parties) a notification with respect to
the Transactions pursuant to the HSR Act in which each requests early
termination of the waiting period thereunder. Each of the Parties shall
respond, as promptly as reasonably practicable to all information requests
from a Government Antitrust Entity under the HSR Act, and shall reasonably
cooperate with each other in responding to any such request. Each of the
Parties will furnish to the other (or its outside counsel) and, upon request,
to any Government Antitrust Entity, such information and assistance as may be
reasonably requested in connection with the foregoing, including by responding
promptly to and complying fully with any request for additional information

investigation or proceeding under the HSR Act relating to the Transactions.
Except as may be prohibited by any Government Antitrust Entity, in connection
with any _ _

 



-38-  investigation or proceeding under the HSR Act concerning the Transactions,
each of the Parties shall permit Representatives of the other Parties to be
present and participate in all meetings, conferences, or other communications
with a Government Antitrust Entity relating to any such proceeding or
investigation.

 

(f) In furtherance and not in limitation of the efforts referred to above in
this Section 5.6, if any objections are asserted with respect to the
Transactions under the HSR Act, or if any Action, suit or proceeding is
instituted (or threatened to be instituted) by the FTC, the DOJ or any other
Governmental Entity or any third party challenging the Transactions or that
would otherwise prohibit or materially impair or materially delay the
consummation of the Transactions, each Party shall use its commercially
reasonable efforts to resolve any such objections or actions, suits or
proceedings so as to permit the consummation of the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement as expeditiously as possible.

(g) Notwithstanding the foregoing in this Section 5.6, none of Parent or its
Affiliates shall be obligated to: (i) offer, negotiate, commit to or effect,
by consent decree, hold separate order, trust or otherwise, the sale,

Notice [2015] No. 7 in connection with indirect transfer of any PRC
Subsidiary of the Company that would occur as a result of the Merger (the "

Governmental Entity within thirty (30) days following the Closing. __

resolve or agree to take any of the foregoing actions (any of the foregoing,

to continue, any and all discussions or negotiations, if any, with any third
party (other than Parent, Merger Sub or their respective Affiliates or
Representatives) ongoing as of the date of the Agreement with respect to any

with, a third party (or such third partys Representatives) that has made (and

Company Financial Advisor, constitutes or could reasonably be expected to
result in a Superior Proposal, (ii) thereafter furnish to such third party
non-public information relating to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries

the Company Board determines in good faith, after consultation with outside
legal counsel, that the failure to take such action 

 



-40- _ _ would reasonably be expected to be inconsistent with the fiduciary duties
of the Company Board under applicable Law. Nothing contained herein shall
prevent the Company Board from (i) disclosing to the Companys shareholders a
position contemplated by Rule 14d-9 and Rule 14e-2(a) promulgated under the
Exchange Act with regard to an Acquisition Proposal or (ii) making any
disclosure to the Companys shareholders that the Company Board determines,
after consultation with its outside legal counsel, is required in order to
fulfill its fiduciary duties under, or in order to otherwise comply with,
applicable Law; _provided_ , _however_ , that any such statement(s) shall be
subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement. For the avoidance of
doubt, it shall not constitute a Company Adverse Recommendation Change for the
Company Board to make a "stop, look and listen" communication pursuant to
Rule 14d9-f or any statement to similar effect. __

(d) The Company Board shall not take any of the actions referred to in
clauses (i) through (iv) of Section 5.7(c) unless the Company shall have
delivered to Parent a prior written notice advising Parent that it intends to
take such action. The Company shall notify Parent promptly (and in any event
within one (1) Business Day) orally and in writing (which may be by email)
after it obtains Knowledge of the receipt by the Company (or any of its
Representatives) of any Acquisition Proposal or any request that is received
after the date of this Agreement from any Person (other than Parent, Merger
Sub or their respective Affiliates or Representatives) for non-public
information relating to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or for access
to the business, properties, assets, books or records of the Company or any
of its Subsidiaries, in each case, related to an Acquisition Proposal or, to
the Knowledge of the Company, that is to be used for the purposes of making an
Acquisition Proposal. In such notice, the Company shall identify the third
party making, and details of the material terms and conditions of, any such
Acquisition Proposal or request. The Company shall notify Parent promptly (and
in any event within one (1) Business Day) of any material amendments or
proposed amendments as to price and other material terms thereof. Furthermore,
the Company shall promptly (and in any event within one (1) Business Day)
after receipt or delivery thereof, provide Parent (or its outside counsel)
with copies of all material transaction agreements accompanying such
Acquisition Proposal or request (including any written, or electronic material
to the extent such material contains any financial terms, conditions or
other material terms relating to any Acquisition Proposal, including the
financing thereof). The Company shall provide Parent with at least twenty-four
(24) hours prior notice of any meeting of the Company Board (or such lesser
notice as is provided to the members of the Company Board) at which the
Company Board is reasonably expected to consider any Acquisition Proposal. The
Company shall promptly provide Parent with copies of any non-public
information concerning the Companys business, present or future performance,
financial condition or results of operations, provided by or on behalf of the
Company to any third party in accordance with Section 5.7(c), to the extent
such information has not been previously provided to Parent or its
Representatives. The Company shall not, and shall cause its Subsidiaries not
to, enter into any Contract with any Person subsequent to the date of this
Agreement that prohibits the Company from providing the information described
in Section 5.7(c) or this Section 5.7(d) to Parent.

 



-41- (e) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in Section 5.7(a)
or Section 5.7(b), at any time prior to receipt of the Company Shareholder
Approval, the Company Board may make a Company Adverse Recommendation Change
for a reason unrelated to a Superior Proposal if the Company Board has
determined in good faith, after consultation with its outside legal counsel,
that, in light an Intervening Event and taking into account the results of any
negotiations with, and any offer from, Parent as contemplated by Section
5.7(f) below, that the failure to take such action would reasonably be
expected to be inconsistent with the fiduciary duties of the Company Board
under applicable Law.

 

(f) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, at any time
prior to the receipt of the Company Shareholder Approval, the Company Board
may make a Company Adverse Recommendation Change or terminate this Agreement
in order to enter into (or permit any Subsidiary of the Company to enter into)
a Company Acquisition Agreement, if:

 

 __(1) the Company promptly notifies Parent, in writing, at least three (3)
Business Days (the " _Notice Period_ ") before making a Company Adverse
Recommendation Change (or, in the case of a Superior Proposal, entering into
(or causing a Subsidiary of the Company to enter into) a Company Acquisition
Agreement), of its intention to take such action with respect to a Superior
Proposal, which notice shall state expressly that the Company has either (A)
received an Acquisition Proposal that the Company Board intends to declare a
Superior Proposal or (B) recognized the occurrence of an Intervening Event,
and that the Company Board intends to make a Company Adverse Recommendation
Change and/or the Company intends to enter into a Company Acquisition
Agreement with respect thereto, as applicable; __

(2) with respect to a Superior Proposal, the Company attaches to such notice
the most current version of any written proposed agreement providing for the
transaction contemplated by such Superior Proposal (which version shall be
updated on a prompt basis) and the identity of the third party making such
Superior Proposal;

 

(3) the Company shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries to, and shall use its
reasonable best efforts to cause its and its Subsidiaries Representatives
to, during the Notice Period, negotiate with Parent in good faith to make such
adjustments in the terms and conditions of this Agreement so that (A) such
Acquisition Proposal ceases to constitute a Superior Proposal if Parent, in
its discretion, proposes to make such adjustments in a manner that would form
a binding Contract if accepted by the Company (it being agreed that, with
respect to a Superior Proposal, in the event that, after commencement of the
Notice Period, there is any material revision to the material terms of such
Acquisition Proposal, including, any revision in price, the Notice Period
shall be extended, if applicable, to ensure that at least two (2)
Business Days remain in the Notice Period subsequent to the time the Company
notifies Parent of any such material revision (it being understood that there
may be multiple extensions)) or (B) the Company Boards fiduciary duty to make
a Company Adverse Recommendation Change as a result of an Intervening Event
would be obviated, as applicable; and

 



-42- (4) the Company Board determines in good faith, after consulting with outside
legal counsel and the Company Financial Advisor, that (A) such Acquisition
Proposal continues to constitute a Superior Proposal or (B) the Company
Boards fiduciary duty to make a Company Adverse Recommendation Change as a
result of an Intervening Event would remain, as applicable, after taking into
account any adjustments made by Parent during the Notice Period in the terms
and conditions of this Agreement.

 

(g) The Company shall keep confidential any proposals made by Parent to revise
the terms of this Agreement, other than in the event of any amendment to this
Agreement or to the extent required by applicable Law to be disclosed.

(h) The Company agrees that any action taken by a Company Representative
that, if taken by the Company, would constitute a material breach of the
restrictions set forth in this Section 5.7 shall be deemed to be a material
breach of this Section 5.7 by the Company.

(i) No Company Adverse Recommendation Change shall change the approval of the
Company Board for purposes of causing any takeover Law to be applicable to
the Transactions.

5.8 _Preparation of the Proxy Statement_.

 

(a) Within ten (10) Business Days after the date of this Agreement, the
Company shall prepare, in consultation with Parent, and cause to be filed
with the SEC the Proxy Statement in preliminary form. Each of the Company and
Parent shall furnish all information concerning itself, its Affiliates and the
holders of its shares to the other and provide such other assistance as may
be reasonably requested in connection with the preparation, filing and
distribution of the Proxy Statement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the
Company shall have no responsibility with respect to information or statements
made or incorporated by reference in the Proxy Statement which were based on
information supplied by or on behalf of Parent.

(b) The Company shall promptly notify Parent upon the receipt of any comments
from the SEC or any request from the SEC for amendments or supplements to the
Proxy Statement, and shall, as promptly as practicable after receipt thereof,
provide Parent with copies of all correspondence between the Company and its
Representatives, on one hand, and the SEC, on the other hand, and all written
comments with respect to the Proxy Statement received by the Company from the
SEC and advise Parent of any oral comments with respect to the Proxy
Statement received from the SEC. The Company shall use its reasonable best
efforts to respond as promptly as practicable to any comments from the SEC
with respect to the Proxy Statement. Parent shall and shall cause its
Representatives to assist and cooperate with the Company and its
Representatives in the resolution of any such comments from the SEC related
thereto. Notwithstanding the foregoing, prior to filing the preliminary or
definitive draft of the Proxy Statement with the SEC, mailing the Proxy
Statement (or any amendment or supplement thereto), or responding to any
comments of the SEC with respect thereto, the Company shall provide Parent a
reasonable opportunity to review and comment on such document or response in
advance (including the proposed final version of such document or response)
and the Company shall consider in good faith any comments provided by Parent
or any of its Representatives with respect thereto.

 



-43- (c) If, at any time prior to the receipt of the Company Shareholder Approval,
any information relating to the Company or Parent, respectively, or any of
their respective Affiliates, should be discovered by the Company or Parent
which, in the reasonable judgment of the Company or Parent, respectively,
should be set forth in an amendment of, or a supplement to, the Proxy
Statement, so that any of such documents would not include any misstatement of
a material fact or omit to state any material fact necessary to make the
statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made,
not misleading, the Party which discovers such information shall promptly
notify the other Parties, and the Company and Parent shall cooperate in the
prompt filing with the SEC of any necessary amendment of, or supplement to,
the Proxy Statement and, to the extent required by Law, in disseminating the
information contained in such amendment or supplement to shareholders of the
Company. Nothing in this Section 5.8(c) shall limit the obligations of any
Party under Section 5.8(b).

(d) For purposes of this Section 5.8, any information concerning or related to
the Company, its Affiliates or the Company Shareholder Meeting will be deemed
to have been provided by the Company, and any information concerning or
related to Parent or its Affiliates will be deemed to have been provided by
Parent.

 

(e) The Company shall bear all of all fees and expenses, other than attorneys
fees, incurred by or on behalf of the Company in connection with the filing,
printing and mailing of the Proxy Statement and any amendments or supplements
thereto.

 

5.9 _Company Shareholder Meeting._

 

(a) As promptly as practicable following the date of this Agreement, the
Company shall, in accordance with applicable Law and the Company Articles and
Company Bylaws, establish a record date for, duly call, give notice of,
convene and hold the Company Shareholder Meeting. The Company shall use its
reasonable best efforts to cause the Proxy Statement to be mailed to
the shareholders of the Company entitled to vote at the Company Shareholder
Meeting and to hold the Company Shareholder Meeting as soon as practicable
thereafter. The Company shall, through the Company Board of Directors,
recommend to its shareholders that they give the Company Shareholder
Approval, include such recommendation in the Proxy Statement and solicit and
use its reasonable best efforts to obtain the Company Shareholder Approval,
except in each case to the extent that the Company Board of Directors shall
have made a Company Adverse Recommendation Change as permitted by Section 5.7.
Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this Section 5.9, if:

 

(1) on a date for which the Company Shareholder Meeting is scheduled, the
Company has not received proxies representing a sufficient number of shares
of Company Common Stock (A) to conduct business at the meeting or (B) to
obtain the Company Shareholder Approval, whether or not a quorum is present;

 

(2) the Company is required to postpone or adjourn the Company Shareholder
Meeting by applicable Law, order or a request from the SEC or its staff; or

 



-44- (3) the Company Board (or any committee thereof) has determined in good faith
(after consultation with outside legal counsel) that it is necessary or
appropriate to postpone or adjourn the Company Shareholder Meeting, including
in order to give the Companys shareholders sufficient time to evaluate
any information or disclosure that the Company has sent to the shareholders
of the Company or otherwise made available to the shareholders of the Company
(including in connection with any Company Adverse Recommendation Change);

 

then, the Company shall have the right to make one or more successive
postponements or adjournments of the Company Shareholder Meeting. Once the
Company has established a record date for the Company Shareholder Meeting, the
Company shall not change such record date or establish a different record date
for the Company Stockholder Meeting without the prior written consent
of Parent (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or
delayed), unless, following consultation with Parent, required to do so by
applicable Law or the Company Articles or Company Bylaws. Without the prior
written consent of Parent (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed), the approval of this Agreement, the adjournment of
the Company Shareholder Meeting, as necessary, to solicit additional proxies
if there are insufficient votes in favor of approval of this Agreement, and
the advisory vote required by Rule 14a-21(c) under the Exchange Act shall be
the only matters (other than matters of procedure and matters required by
applicable Law to be voted on by the Companys shareholders in connection
with the approval of this Agreement) that the Company shall propose to be
acted on by the shareholders of the Company at the Company Shareholder
Meeting.

 

(b) The Company will use reasonable best efforts to hold the Company
Shareholder Meeting as soon as practicable after the Proxy Statement is
mailed to the Companys shareholders.

(c) Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, unless this Agreement
has been previously terminated in full compliance with ARTICLE IX, the Company
agrees that (i) its obligation to duly call, give notice of, convene and hold
the Company Shareholder Meeting shall not be affected by any Change of
Board Recommendation and (ii) its obligations pursuant to this Section 5.9
shall not be affected by the commencement, public proposal, public disclosure
or communication to the Company of any Acquisition Proposal (whether or not a
Superior Proposal). Unless this Agreement is terminated in accordance with
ARTICLE IX, the Company agrees that it shall not submit to the vote of the
shareholders of the Company any Acquisition Proposal (whether or not a
Superior Proposal) prior to the vote of the shareholders of the Company with
respect to the Merger at the Company Shareholder Meeting.

5.10 _Disposition of Company Equity Awards_. The Company Board, or a
committee thereof consisting of Non-Employee Directors (as such term is
defined for purposes of Rule 16b-3(d) under the Exchange Act), shall adopt
resolutions in advance of the Effective Time providing that, in connection
with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, the disposition of any
Company Common Stock or Company Equity Awards and/or receipt of Parent Stock
by Exchange Act Section 16 reporting persons is intended to be exempt from
Exchange Act Section 16(b) liability pursuant to Rule 16b-3 under the Exchange
Act.

 



-45- ARTICLE VI

 

 _Additional Covenants of Parent_

 

6.1 _Fulfillment of Conditions_. From the date of the Agreement to the Closing
Date, Parent shall use its reasonable best efforts to fulfill the conditions
specified in ARTICLE VIII. The foregoing obligation includes, without
limitation, (a) executing and delivering documents as are necessary or
desirable to consummate the Transactions, (b) taking or refraining from such
actions as may be necessary or reasonably requested by the Company to fulfill
such conditions (including using its reasonable best efforts to conduct the
business of Parent and the Merger Sub in such manner that on the Closing Date
the representations and warranties of Parent contained herein shall be
accurate as though then made).

6.2  _Regulatory and Other Authorizations; Notices and Consents_. Parent
shall use its reasonable best efforts to obtain all authorizations, Consents,
orders and approvals of all Governmental Entities and officials that may be or
become necessary for its execution and delivery of, and the performance of
its obligations pursuant to, this Agreement and the Transaction Documents to
which it is a party and shall cooperate fully with the Company in promptly
seeking to obtain all such authorizations, Consents, orders and approvals
(and in such regard use reasonable best efforts to cause the relevant
Government Entities to permit the Company and/or its counsel to participate in
the conversation and correspondence with such Government Authorities together
with Parents counsel). For the avoidance of doubt, this Section 6.2 shall be
in furtherance of, and not in limitation of, any of Parents obligations under
Section 5.6.

 

6.3 _Directors  and Officers Indemnification and Insurance_.

 

 __(a) Parent and Merger Sub agree that all rights to indemnification,
advancement of expenses and exculpation by the Company or its Subsidiaries
now existing in favor of each Person who is now, or has been at any time prior
to the date of the Agreement or who becomes prior to the Effective Time an
officer or director of the Company or its Subsidiaries (each an "
_Indemnified Party_ ") as provided in the Company Articles and Company Bylaws
or similar governing documents of the Companys Subsidiaries, in each case as
in effect on the date of this Agreement, or pursuant to any other Contracts
in effect on the date of the Agreement and disclosed in Section 6.3(a) of the
Company Disclosure Schedule (the " _Indemnification Contracts_ ") (or with
respect to Persons who become a director or officer of the Company prior to
the Effective Time, in a form substantially similar the Indemnification
Contracts) for acts or omissions occurring prior to the Effective Time
(including acts or omissions occurring in connection with this Agreement and
the consummation of the Merger) shall be honored by the Surviving Corporation
and its Subsidiaries and shall survive the Merger and shall remain in full
force and effect in accordance with their terms. Parent shall, and shall cause
the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries to, honor and fulfill in all
respects the obligations of the Company and its Subsidiaries under any and
such Indemnification Contracts. __

 



-46- (b) For six years after the Effective Time, to the fullest extent permitted
under applicable Law, Parent and the Surviving Corporation and any successor
to the Surviving Corporation shall, and Parent shall cause the Surviving
Corporation or its successor to indemnify, defend and hold harmless each
Indemnified Party against all losses, claims, damages, liabilities, fees,
expenses, Judgments and fines arising directly or indirectly, in whole or in
part out of actions or omissions in their capacity as such occurring at or
prior to the Effective Time (including in connection with the Transactions
contemplated by this Agreement), and shall advance and/or reimburse each
Indemnified Party for any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by such
Indemnified Party in connection with investigating or defending any
such losses, claims, damages, liabilities, fees, expenses, Judgments and
fines as the same are incurred, subject to the Surviving Corporations receipt
of an undertaking by such Indemnified Party to repay such legal and other fees
and expenses paid in advance if it is ultimately determined in a final and
non-appealable Judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction that such
Indemnified Party is not entitled to be indemnified under applicable Law;
provided, however, that the Surviving Corporation will not be liable for any
settlement effected without the Surviving Corporations prior written Consent
(which Consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed).

 

 __(c) Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to provide, for an
aggregate period of not less than six (6) years from the Effective Time, the
Companys current directors and officers an insurance and indemnification
policy that provides coverage for events occurring prior to the Effective Time
(the " _D andO Insurance_") that is no less favorable than the Companys
existing policy as of the date of this Agreement or, if insurance coverage
that is no less favorable is unavailable, the best available coverage;
provided, however, that the Surviving Corporation shall not be required to
pay an annual premium for the DandO Insurance in excess of three hundred percent
(300%) of the last annual premium paid prior to the date of this Agreement or,
if less, the cost of a policy providing coverage on the same terms as the
Companys existing policy as of the date of this Agreement; provided, further,
that the Company may prior to the Effective Time substitute therefor a single
premium tail coverage with respect to DandO Insurance, in a form reasonably
acceptable to Parent, with an annual cost not in excess of three hundred
percent (300%) of the last annual premium paid prior to the date of this
Agreement. __

 

(d) The obligations of Parent and the Surviving Corporation under this Section
6.3 shall survive the consummation of the Merger and shall not be terminated
or modified in such a manner as to adversely affect any Indemnified Party to
whom this Section 6.3 applies without the Consent of such affected Indemnified
Party (it being expressly agreed that the Indemnified Parties to whom this
Section 6.3 applies shall be third party beneficiaries of this Section 6.3,
each of whom may enforce the provisions of this Section 6.3).

 

(e) In the event the Surviving Corporation or any of its respective successors
or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any other Person and shall
not be the continuing or surviving corporation or entity in such consolidation
or merger or (ii) transfers or licenses all or substantially all of its
properties and assets (including Intellectual Property Rights) to any Person,
then, and in either such case, proper provision shall be made so that each of
such successors and assigns of the Surviving Corporation shall assume all of
the obligations set forth in this Section 6.3 to the extent of the assets
transferred to such successor or assign. The

 



-47-  agreements and covenants contained herein shall not be deemed to be
exclusive of any other rights to which any Indemnified Party is entitled,
whether pursuant to Law, Contract or otherwise. Nothing in this Agreement is
intended to, shall be construed to or shall release, waive or impair any
rights to directors and officers insurance claims under any policy that is
or has been in existence with respect to the Company or its officers,
directors and employees, it being understood and agreed that the
indemnification provided for in this Section 6.3 is not prior to, or in
substitution for, any such claims under any such policies.

 

6.4 _Employee Benefit Matters_

 

 __(a) For a period of one year following the Effective Time, Parent will
provide, or will cause to be provided, to those employees of the Company who
continue to be employed by Parent and its Subsidiaries, including, following
the Closing, the Company (individually, a " _Continuing Employee_ " and
collectively, " _Continuing Employees_ ") with: (i) cash compensation,
including base salary rate and commission and target bonus opportunity, no
lower than the cash compensation provided to such Continuing Employee
immediately prior to the Effective Time, (ii) equity awards set forth on
Section 6.4(a) of the Company Disclosure Schedule, with respect to fiscal year
2016 awards previously approved by the Company, and (iii) health and welfare
benefits on terms at least as favorable, in the aggregate, as the health and
welfare benefits provided to such Continuing Employee by the Company
immediately prior to the Effective Time. __

 

(b) To the extent Parent elects to have Continuing Employees and their
eligible dependents participate in its employee benefit plans, program or
policies following the Effective Time, Parent shall use commercially
reasonable efforts to, and shall cause the Surviving Corporation to use
commercially reasonable efforts to, treat, and cause the applicable benefit
plans in which Continuing Employees are entitled to participate to treat, the
service of Continuing Employees with the Company or any Subsidiary of the
Company or any of their predecessors to the extent previously recognized by
the Company as of the date hereof attributable to any period before the
Effective Time as service rendered to Parent, the Surviving Corporation, any
Subsidiary of Parent for purposes of eligibility to participate, vesting and
for other appropriate benefits including the applicability of minimum waiting
periods for participation, but excluding benefit accrual (including minimum
pension amount), equity incentive plans and eligibility for early retirement
under any benefit plan of Parent or eligibility for retiree welfare benefit
plans or as would otherwise result in a duplication of benefits. Without
limiting the foregoing, Parent shall cause any actively at work or similar
limitations, eligibility waiting periods, evidence of insurability
requirements or required physical examinations under any health or similar
plan of Parent to be waived with respect to Continuing Employees and their
eligible dependents. Parent shall also use commercially reasonable efforts to
cause any deductibles paid by Continuing Employees under any of the Companys
or its Subsidiaries health plans in the plan year in which Continuing
Employees and their eligible dependents are transitioned to Parents health or
similar plans to be credited towards deductibles under the health plans of
Parent or any Subsidiary of Parent.

(c) For the terms of the agreements or arrangements, Parent shall cause the
Company or the Surviving Corporation, as applicable, to honor, in accordance
with their terms, the employment, severance and change in control agreements
and arrangements that are listed on Section 6.4(c) of the Company Disclosure
Schedule.

 



-48- (d) Nothing in this Agreement will require the continued employment of
any Person, and except as expressly set forth in this Section 6.4, no
provision of this Agreement will prevent Parent or the Surviving Corporation
from amending or terminating any benefit plans of the Company, the Surviving
Corporation, Parent or any of their respective Subsidiaries.

(e) The Company and Parent acknowledge and agree that all provisions contained
in this Section 6.4 with respect to employees are included for the sole
benefit of the respective parties and will not create any right in any other
Person, including any employees, former employees, any participant in any
benefit plan or any beneficiary thereof, nor will require the Company to
continue or amend any particular benefit plan after the consummation of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement for any employee or former
employee of the Company, and any such plan may be amended or terminated in
accordance with its terms and applicable Law.

shall remain in full force and effect and (ii) a Party shall remain liable for
any liabilities or damages caused by such Party to the extent such liabilities
or damages were the result of fraud or the willful and material breach of
this Agreement by such Party.

9.6 _Fees and Expenses Following Termination_.

(a) If this Agreement is terminated by Parent pursuant to Section 9.3(a), then
the Company shall pay to Parent (by wire transfer of immediately available
funds), within two (2) Business Days after such termination, a fee in an
amount equal to the Termination Fee.

 

(b) If this Agreement is terminated by the Company pursuant to Section 9.4(a),
then the Company shall pay to Parent (by wire transfer of immediately
available funds), at or prior to such termination, the Termination Fee.

 



-53- (c) If this Agreement is terminated by the Company or Parent pursuant to (i)
Section 9.2(a) hereof and provided that the Company Shareholder Approval shall
not have been obtained at the Company Shareholders Meeting (including any
adjournment or postponement thereof) or (ii) Section 9.2(c) hereof and,
in the case of clauses (i) and (ii) immediately above, (A) prior to such
termination (in the case of termination pursuant to Section 9.2(a)) or the
Company Shareholders Meeting (in the case of termination pursuant to Section
9.2(c)), an Acquisition Proposal shall have been publicly disclosed and not
withdrawn and (B) within twelve (12) months following the date of such
termination of this Agreement the Company shall have entered into a
definitive agreement with respect to any Acquisition Proposal, or any
Acquisition Proposal shall have been consummated (in each case whether or not
such Acquisition Proposal is the same as the original Acquisition Proposal
publicly disclosed), then in any such event the Company shall pay to Parent
(by wire transfer of immediately available funds), no later than two (2)
Business Days following the consummation of such transaction, the Termination
Fee, (it being understood for all purposes of this Section 9.6(c), all
references in the definition of Acquisition Proposal to 15% shall be deemed to
be references to "more than 50%" instead). If a Person (other than Parent or
its Affiliates) makes an Acquisition Proposal that has been publicly
disclosed and subsequently withdrawn prior to such termination or the Company
Shareholders Meeting, as applicable, and, within twelve (12) months following
the date of the termination of this Agreement, such Person or any of
its controlled Affiliates makes an Acquisition Proposal that is publicly
disclosed, such initial Acquisition Proposal shall be deemed to have been "not
withdrawn" for purposes of clauses (1) and (2) of this paragraph (c).

 

(d) The Company acknowledges and hereby agrees that the provisions of this
Section 9.6 are an integral part of the Transactions contemplated by this
Agreement (including the Merger), and that, without such provisions, Parent
and Merger Sub would not have entered into this Agreement. If the Company
shall fail to pay in a timely manner the amounts due pursuant to this Section
9.6, and, in order to obtain such payment, Parent makes a claim against the
Company therefor that results in a Judgment against the Company, the Company
shall pay to Parent the reasonable and documented costs and expenses of
Parent (including its reasonable attorneys fees and expenses) incurred or
accrued in connection with such suit, together with interest on the amounts
set forth in this Section 9.6 at the prime lending rate prevailing during such
period as published in The Wall Street Journal. Any interest payable
hereunder shall be calculated on a daily basis from the date such amounts were
required to be paid until (but excluding) the date of actual payment. The
Parties acknowledge and agree that in no event shall the Company be obligated
to pay the Termination Fee on more than one occasion.

(e) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, Parent and
Merger Sub agree that, upon any termination of this Agreement under
circumstances where the Termination Fee is payable by the Company pursuant to
this Section 9.6 and such Termination Fee is paid in full, such fee shall be
deemed to be liquidated damages for any and all losses or damages suffered or
incurred by Parent or Merger Sub or any of their respective Affiliates in
connection with this Agreement and the negotiation, execution and performance
thereof, and Parent and Merger Sub shall be precluded from any other remedy
against the Company or its Subsidiaries, at law or in equity or otherwise, and
neither Parent nor Merger Sub shall seek to obtain any recovery, Judgment,
or damages of any kind, including consequential, indirect, or

 



-54-  punitive damages, against the Company or any of the Companys Subsidiaries
or any of their respective directors, officers, employees, partners, managers,
members, stockholders or Affiliates or their respective Representatives in
connection with this Agreement or the Transactions contemplated hereby.

(f) Except as expressly set forth in this Section 9.6, all Expenses incurred
in connection with this Agreement and the Transactions contemplated hereby
will be paid by the Party incurring such Expenses.

 

9.7 _Amendment_. At any time prior to the Effective Time, this Agreement may
be amended or supplemented in any and all respects, whether before or after
receipt of the Company Shareholder Approval, by written agreement signed by
each of the Parties hereto; provided, however, that following the receipt of
the Company Shareholder Approval, there shall be no amendment or supplement
to the provisions of this Agreement which by Law or in accordance with the
rules of any relevant self-regulatory organization would require further
approval by the holders of the Company Shares without such approval.

 

9.8 _Extension; Waiver_. At any time prior to the Effective Time, Parent or
Merger Sub, on the one hand, or the Company, on the other hand, may (a)
extend the time for the performance of any of the obligations of the other
Party(ies), (b) waive any inaccuracies in the representations and warranties
of the other Party(ies) contained in this Agreement or in any document
delivered under this Agreement, or (c) unless prohibited by applicable Law,
waive compliance with any of the covenants, agreements or conditions contained
in this Agreement. Any agreement on the part of a Party to any extension
or waiver will be valid only if set forth in an instrument in writing signed
by such Party. The failure or delay of any Party to assert any of its rights
under this Agreement or otherwise will not constitute a waiver of such rights.

(iii) as expressly set forth in this Agreement. The third-party beneficiary
rights referenced in clause (ii) of the preceding sentence may be exercised
only by the Company (on behalf of the Companys equityholders as their agent)

equityholder whether purporting to act in its capacity as a Company
equityholder or purporting to assert any right (derivatively or otherwise) on
behalf of the Company, will have any right or ability to exercise or cause
the exercise of any such right.

connection with or relating to any matter which is the subject of this
Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement will be
governed by, and construed in accordance with, the Laws of the State of

Agreement, the Company or Parent shall be entitled to obtain, without proof of
actual damages (and in addition to any other remedy to which such Party may
be entitled at law or in equity): (a) a decree or order from a court of
competent jurisdiction of specific performance to enforce the observance and
performance of such covenant or obligation; and (b) an injunction from a
court of competent jurisdiction restraining such breach or threatened breach.
Each Party hereby waives any requirement for the securing or posting of any
bond in connection with any such remedy.

 



-59- 10.10 _Assignment_. Neither this Agreement nor any of the rights,
interests or obligations under this Agreement shall be assigned, in whole or
in part, by operation of law or otherwise by any of the Parties without the
prior written consent of the other Parties. Any purported assignment without
such consent shall be void. Subject to the preceding sentences, this
Agreement will be binding upon, inure to the benefit of, and be enforceable
by, the Parties and their respective successors and assigns.
