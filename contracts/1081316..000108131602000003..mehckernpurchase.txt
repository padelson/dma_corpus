terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement; and

                  NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the mutual terms,
conditions and other agreements set forth herein, the parties hereto hereby
agree as follows:

                                   ARTICLE I.
                                SALE AND PURCHASE

SECTION 1.1. Agreement to Sell and to Purchase. On the Closing Date (as
hereinafter defined) and upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth
in this Agreement: (a) LLC1 shall sell, assign, transfer, convey and deliver all
of its Interests, free and clear of any pledges, restrictions on transfer,
proxies and voting or other agreements, liens, claims, charges, mortgages,
security interests or other legal or equitable encumbrances, limitations or
restrictions of any nature whatsoever ("Encumbrances" ), to Buyer1, and Buyer1
shall purchase and accept such Interests from LLC1; and (b) LLC2 shall sell,
assign, transfer, convey and deliver all of its Interests, free and clear of any
Encumbrances to Buyer2, and Buyer2 shall purchase and accept such Interests from
LLC2.

SECTION 1.2. Closing. The closings of such sales and purchases of the Interests
(together, the "Closing") shall take place at 10:00 A.M., one day after the
satisfaction of the conditions contained in Article V and VI (other than those
conditions that by their nature are to be fulfilled at Closing), or at such
other time and date as the parties hereto shall agree in writing (the "Closing
Date"), at the offices of Willkie Farr & Gallagher, 787 Seventh Avenue, New
York, New York 10019, or at such other place as the parties hereto shall agree
in writing. At the Closing, the Sellers shall deliver to the Buyers or their
designees a duly executed bill of sale, in form and substance reasonably
satisfactory to the Buyers and the Sellers, transferring the Interests in the
Company (the "Bill of Sale"). In full consideration and exchange for the
Interests, (a) Buyer1 shall thereupon pay to LLC1 one-half of the Purchase Price
as provided in Section 1.3 hereof; and (b) Buyer2 shall thereupon pay to LLC2
one-half of the Purchase Price as provided in Section 1.3 hereof. Neither Buyer1
nor Buyer2 shall have any obligation to purchase, nor LLC1 or LLC2 an obligation
to sell, any Interests unless all of the Interests are to be sold on the Closing
Date.

SECTION 1.3. Purchase Price.  The aggregate purchase price for the Interests
shall be $450,000,000 as adjusted by Section 1.4 (the "Purchase Price").

SECTION 1.4. Adjustment to Purchase Price. (a) Schedule 1.4(a) contains a
statement prepared by the Sellers setting forth in reasonable detail the amount
of Working Capital of the Company as of December 31, 2001 (the "Base
Statement"). For purposes of this Agreement, "Working Capital" shall mean
Current Assets less Current Liabilities; "Current Assets" shall mean current
assets, excluding inventories, materials and supplies and prepaid amounts; and
"Current Liabilities" shall mean current liabilities, excluding the current
portion of long-term debt and any accounts payable to the Sellers or any of the
Sellers' affiliates related to the 1Line System (as defined in Section 9.14). On
the Closing Date, the Sellers shall pay to the Buyers $13,702,000, which is the
aggregate excess of the Current Liabilities over the Current Assets on the Base
Statement and is shown as a negative amount on the Base Statement ("Base
Statement Working Capital"). At least three days prior to the Closing Date, the
Sellers shall prepare and deliver to the Buyers a statement (the "Closing
Statement"), which shall set forth in reasonable detail the amount of Working
Capital of the Company as of December 31, 2001 based upon the Audited Financial
Statements (as hereinafter defined). The Base Statement shall be prepared in
accordance with RAP (as hereinafter defined) and on a basis consistent with the
2001 Financial Statements (as defined in Section 2.7(a), using the same
accounting methods, policies, practices, procedures and adjustments as were used
in the preparation of the 2001 Financial Statements. The Closing Statement shall
be prepared in accordance with RAP and on a basis consistent with the 2001
Financial Statements and the Audited Financial Statements, using the same
accounting methods, policies, practices, procedures and adjustments as were used
in the preparation of the 2001 Financial Statements and the Audited Financial
Statements.

(b) The Buyers shall have 20 days to review the Closing Statement and to inform
the Sellers in writing of any disagreement (the "Objection") which they may have
with the Closing Statement. If the Sellers do not receive the Objection within
such 20-day period, the amount of Working Capital set forth on the Closing
Statement delivered pursuant to Section 1.4(a) shall be deemed to have been
accepted by the Buyers and shall become the Final Closing Statement. If the
Buyers do timely deliver an Objection to the Sellers, the Sellers shall then
have 20 days from the date of receipt (the "Review Period") to review and
respond to the Objection. The Buyers and the Sellers shall attempt in good faith
to resolve any disagreements with respect to the determination of the Working
Capital of the Company as of December 31, 2001. If they are unable to resolve
all of their disagreements with respect to the determination of Working Capital
of the Company as of December 31, 2001, within 10 days following the expiration
of the Sellers' Review Period, they may refer, at the option of either the
Buyers or the Sellers, their differences to PriceWaterhouseCoopers, or if
PriceWaterhouseCoopers declines to accept such engagement, to an internationally
recognized firm of independent public accountants selected jointly by the Buyers
and the Sellers, who shall determine only with respect to the differences so
submitted, whether and to what extent, if any, the amount of Working Capital of
the Company as of December 31, 2001 set forth in the Closing Statement requires
adjustment. If the Buyers and the Sellers are unable to so select the
independent public accountants within five days of PriceWaterhouseCoopers
declining to accept such engagement, either the Buyers or the Sellers may
thereafter request that the American Arbitration Association make such selection
(as applicable, PriceWaterhouseCoopers, the firm selected by the Buyers and the
Sellers or the firm selected by the American Arbitration Association is referred
to as the "CPA Firm"). The Buyers and the Sellers shall direct the CPA Firm to
use its reasonable best efforts to render its determination within 30 days. The
CPA Firm's determination shall be conclusive and binding upon the Buyers and the
Sellers. The fees and disbursements of the CPA Firm shall be shared equally by
the Buyers and the Sellers. The Buyers and the Sellers shall make readily
available to the CPA Firm all relevant books and records relating to the
determination of Working Capital and all other items reasonably requested by the
CPA Firm. The Closing Statement as agreed to by the Buyers or the Sellers or as
determined by the CPA firm shall be referred to as the "Final Closing
Statement."

(c) Within three business days after the Closing Statement becomes the Final
Closing Statement, if Working Capital on the Final Closing Statement exceeds
Base Statement Working Capital, the Buyers shall pay such excess to the Sellers,
or if Base Statement Working Capital exceeds Working Capital on the Final
Closing Statement, the Sellers shall pay such excess to the Buyers. All amounts
payable under this Section 1.4(c) shall be paid within three business days of
determination of the Final Closing Statement by wire transfer of immediately
available funds to a bank account in the United States of America designated in
writing by the recipient not less than one business day before such payment.

(d) At Closing, the Sellers shall pay to the Buyers an aggregate cash amount
equal to any dividends or distributions made by the Company after December 31,
2001 and through the Closing.

(e) On the Holdback Payment Date (as defined in Section 1.4(i)), the Buyers or
the Company shall pay to the Sellers an aggregate cash amount equal to any
inter-company accounts payables and any inter-company notes payables in each
case of the Company, outstanding on the Closing Date; provided, however, that
any payables in accordance with The Williams Companies, Inc. Federal and State
Tax Allocation Procedure as of May 1, 1995 or any other agreement or contractual
arrangement attributable to Federal, state or local income Taxes related to
taxable income of the Company for any period after December 31, 2001 shall be
excluded from the payment required pursuant to this Section 1.4(e).

(f) On the Holdback Payment Date, the Sellers or the Sellers' affiliates shall
pay to the Company an aggregate cash amount equal to any inter-company accounts
receivables and any inter-company notes receivables, in each case of the
Company, outstanding on the Closing Date.

agreement set forth in Schedule 2.13(c), and no event has occurred, which with
due notice or lapse of time or both, would constitute such a material default by
the Company or its Subsidiaries. To the knowledge of the Sellers and the
Company, (1) no other party to any agreement set forth in Schedule 2.13(c) is in
material default thereof, and (2) no event has occurred which, with due notice
or lapse of time or both, would constitute such a material default by such other
party.

(d) To the extent a representation or warranty is set forth in this Section 2.13
and the same subject matter is covered in another representation or warranty in
this Agreement (other than with respect to the representation regarding Licensed
Software in Section 4.22), the provisions concerning such subject matter in this
Section 2.13 shall govern.

(e) To the Sellers' knowledge, the Company and its Subsidiaries each take
reasonable measures to protect the confidentiality of their trade secrets. To
the Sellers' knowledge, (i) none of the material Intellectual Property has been
used, disclosed or appropriated to the detriment of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries for the benefit of any third party; and (ii) no employee,
independent contractor or agent of the Company or any Subsidiaries has
misappropriated any material trade secrets or other material confidential
information of any third party in the course of the performance of his or her
duties as an employee, independent contractor or agent of the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries.

(f) With respect to intellectual property assets to be assigned to the Company
or the Buyers from the Sellers or Seller's affiliates pursuant to Section 4.19
(the "Assigned Assets"):

(i) The Sellers and the Sellers' affiliates are in compliance in all material
respects with their material contractual obligations. To the Sellers' knowledge,
there are no material conflicts with or infringements by any third party of any
Assigned Assets owned by the Sellers or the Sellers' affiliates. The Assigned
Assets owned by the Sellers and the Sellers' affiliates do not infringe any
intellectual property or other proprietary rights of any third party;

(ii) There is no claim (in writing), suit, action or proceeding pending or, to
the knowledge of the Sellers or the Sellers' affiliates, threatened against
Sellers or the Sellers' affiliates challenging the Sellers' or the Sellers'
affiliates' ownership or use of, or the validity or enforceability of, any
Assigned Assets; and

(iii) Neither the Sellers nor any of their affiliates will be, as a result of
the execution and delivery of this Agreement or the performance of their
obligations under this Agreement, in breach of any agreement set forth in
Schedule 2.13(a). Each Assigned Asset that is a license or other agreement is
valid, binding and enforceable against the parties thereto in accordance with
its terms (except to the extent its enforceability may be limited by applicable
bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization or other similar law affecting the
enforcement of creditors' rights generally or by general equitable principles).
The Sellers and the Sellers' affiliates, as the case may be, have performed all
material obligations to be performed by them under, and are not in material
default or breach of any Assigned Asset that is a license or an agreement and no
event has occurred, which with due notice or lapse of time or both, would
constitute such a material default by the Sellers or the Sellers' affiliates. To
the knowledge of the Sellers and the Sellers' affiliates, no other party to any
Assigned Asset is in material default thereof, and no event has occurred which,
with due notice or lapse of time or both, would constitute such a material
default by such other party.

sets forth a true and complete list of all material licenses, permits,
certificates, franchises, authorizations and approvals issued or granted to the
Company and any Subsidiary by any Governmental Authority (including the date
issued or applied for and the dates of any amendments thereto) (each a "License"

presently and as proposed to be conducted in connection with the Expansion
Projects. Schedule 2.14(a) also sets forth a true and complete list of all

the holder thereof and is valid, in full force and effect, and not subject to
any pending or known threatened administrative or judicial proceeding to
suspend, revoke, cancel or declare such License invalid in any respect.

(b) In the case of Licenses that have been applied for but not yet granted, all
necessary applications have been made in a timely fashion and the Company has no
knowledge as to why any License that has been applied for but not yet granted
(as indicated on Schedule 2.14(a)), will not be obtained without undue burden
and in form and substance to permit the continued lawful conduct of the
Company's business during construction of the Expansion Projects and in
connection with the operation of the Expansion Projects. No License will in any

Agreement or materially adversely affect all or a substantial part of the assets
or the businesses of the Company and the Subsidiaries, individually or in the
aggregate, or the Expansion Projects.

the date hereof. The Company and each Subsidiary, as the case may be, have
performed in all material respects all obligations required to be performed by
them under, and are not in material default or breach of in respect of, any
Commitment, and no event has occurred which, with due notice or lapse of time or
both, would constitute such a default. To the knowledge of the Sellers and the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries, no other party to any Commitment is in
default in any material respect thereof, and no event has occurred which, with
due notice or lapse of time or both, would constitute such a default. The
Sellers have made available to the Buyers or their representatives true and
complete originals or copies of all the Commitments and a copy of every material
default notice received by the Sellers or the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
during the past one year with respect to any of the Commitments.

benefit of, or relate to any or all current or former employees of the Company.
As of the Closing Date, the Company will have no obligation or liability under
any Employee Plans. Schedule 2.20(a) sets forth a true and complete list of all

(the "Business Employees," and such Employee Plans hereinafter referred to as

(b) The Company has no current employees, and no present or contingent liability
to any former employees. Schedule 2.20(b) sets forth a true and complete list

plans or arrangements covering any Business Employee with "change of control" or
similar provisions that would be triggered as a result of the consummation of
this Agreement or the Stock Purchase Agreement dated of even date herewith
between Seller Parent and Buyer Parent or that could otherwise result in
liability to the Company. To the Sellers' and the Company's knowledge, no
Business Employee is obligated under any contract (including licenses, covenants
or commitments of any nature) or other agreement, or subject to any judgment,
decree or order of any court or administrative agency, that would interfere with
the use of such employee's efforts to promote the interests of the Company or
the Buyers or that would conflict with the Company's business as conducted or
proposed to be conducted. Except for those employees who are eligible for early

group of Business Employees, that such person(s) intends to terminate their
employment.

effect through the Closing Date. Neither the Company nor any Subsidiary is in
default under any provisions of the Policies, and there is no claim by the
Company, any Subsidiary or any other person pending under any of the Policies as
to which coverage has been questioned, denied or disputed by the underwriters or
issuers of such Policies. Except as set forth on Schedule 2.22, neither the
Company nor any Subsidiary has received written notice from an insurance carrier
issuing any Policies that alteration of any equipment or any improvements
located on Real Property, purchase of additional equipment, or modification of
any of the methods of doing business of the Company or any Subsidiary, will be
required or suggested after the date hereof. The Policies maintained by the
Company and each Subsidiary are adequate in accordance with industry standards,
the requirements of any applicable agreements and are in at least the minimum
amounts required by, and are otherwise sufficient for purposes of, any currently

but not limited to, all environmental studies, reports and other environmental
records) and, during such period, shall furnish promptly to the Buyers all
information concerning the Company's and its Subsidiaries' business, properties,
liabilities and personnel as the Buyers may request, provided that no
investigation or receipt of information pursuant to this Section 4.2 shall
affect any representation or warranty of the Sellers or the conditions to the
obligations of the Buyers. At the Closing, all of the books of accounts, minute
books, record books and other records (including safety, health, environmental,
maintenance and engineering records and drawings) of the Company and each
Subsidiary will be delivered to the Buyers.

SECTION 4.3. Employee Matters. (a) The Buyers may offer to employ Business
Employees under such terms and conditions as the Buyers may determine subject,
however, to the terms and provisions of this Section 4.3 and the Workforce
Agreement. All Business Employees that accept the Buyers' offer of employment
shall become the Buyers' employees as of the Transfer Date and all such Business
Employees are hereinafter referred to as the "Transferred Employees." The
"Transfer Date" shall be the Closing Date for all Transferred Employees except
those Transferred Employees identified as "Restricted GTC Employees" pursuant to
the terms and provisions of the Workforce Agreement. The Transfer Date for the
Restricted GTC Employees shall be 180 days after the Closing Date, or such other
date as mutually agreed by the parties to this Agreement.

(b) Transferred Employees shall participate in employee benefit plans and
programs of the Buyers on the same basis as other similarly situated employees
of the Buyers.

(c) Each Transferred Employee shall, without duplication of benefits, be given
credit for all service with the Sellers prior to the Transfer Date, using the
same methodology used by the Sellers as of immediately prior to the Transfer
Date for crediting service and determining levels of benefits (i) under all
employee benefit plans, programs and arrangements maintained by or contributed
to by the Buyers (including, without limitation, the Company) in which the
Transferred Employees become participants for purposes of eligibility to
participate, vesting and determination of level of benefits (excluding, however,
benefit accrual under any defined benefit plans), and (ii) for purposes of
calculating the amount of each Transferred Employee's severance benefits, if
any.

(d) The Buyers will, or will cause the Company to, (i) waive all limitations as
to preexisting conditions exclusions and waiting periods with respect to
participation and coverage requirements applicable to the Transferred Employees
under any welfare benefit plans that such employees may be eligible to
participate in after the Transfer Date, other than limitations or waiting
periods that are already in effect with respect to such employees and that have
not been satisfied as of the Transfer Date under any welfare plan maintained for
the Transferred Employees immediately prior to the Transfer Date, and (ii)
provide each Transferred Employee with credit for any co-payments and
deductibles paid prior to the Transfer Date in satisfying any applicable
deductible or out-of-pocket requirements under any welfare plans that such
employees are eligible to participate in after the Transfer Date.

(e) Effective as of the Transfer Date, Transferred Employees shall become fully
vested in their account balances in any defined contribution or 401(k) Plan
maintained by the Seller on behalf of such Transferred Employees (the "Seller
Savings Plan") and distributions of such account balances shall be made
available to such Transferred Employees as soon as practicable following the
Transfer Date, in accordance with, the provisions of the Seller Savings Plan and
applicable law. Except as provided in this Section 4.3(e), all such
distributions shall be in cash. Thereafter, the Buyers shall accept rollover
contributions from the Seller Savings Plan into a defined contribution or 401(k)
Plan maintained by the Buyers (the "Buyers Savings Plan") of the account
balances distributed to the Transferred Employees from the Seller Savings Plan.
With respect to any Transferred Employee who elects to make a direct rollover to
the Buyers Savings Plan and whose account is subject to an outstanding loan as
of the Transfer Date, such employee's distribution shall include a promissory
note for the outstanding balance of the loan as of the date of distribution.
With respect to any Transferred Employee whose account balance includes shares
of Seller Parent stock, such employee may elect to have such shares of stock
rolled over into the directed investments option under the Buyers Savings Plan.

(f) With respect to the transition of benefits coverage, any Transferred
Employee who is unable to participate in the health plans of the Buyers as of
the Transfer Date and elects continuation coverage under the Consolidated
Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1985, as amended, with respect to the
health plans of the Sellers, shall be reimbursed by the Buyers for the period
commencing on the Transfer Date and ending on the date health plan coverage is
made available to such Transferred Employee under the Buyers' health plans, for
the portion of the health care premium that would have been paid by the Sellers
had such Transferred Employee continued in the employment of the Sellers during
such period.

(g) The Buyers and the Sellers agree to cooperate as necessary to effectuate the
provisions of this Section 4.3, including such steps as may reasonably be
required to (i) service any outstanding Seller Savings Plan loans under account
balances of Transferred Employees between the date of such employees commence
employment with the Buyers and the date that such employees' account balances
are distributed, and (ii) ensure an orderly transition of benefits coverage with
respect to the Transferred Employees from the Employee Plans to the Buyers'
plans.

(h) Each Transferred Employee shall, without duplication of benefits, be given
credit for all accrued but unused paid-time-off under the Sellers' paid-time-off
program as of the Transfer Date, using the same methodology used by the Sellers
immediately prior to the Transfer Date for crediting service and determining the
amount of such paid-time-off benefits.

SECTION 4.4. Consents and Approvals. The Sellers and the Buyers shall each use
their reasonable best efforts to obtain, or, in the case of the Sellers, cause
the Company to obtain, all necessary consents, waivers, authorizations and
approvals of all Governmental Authorities, and of all other persons required in
connection with the execution, delivery and performance by them of this
Agreement.

SECTION 4.5. Further Assurances. Upon the request of the Buyers at any time
after the Closing Date, the Sellers will promptly execute and deliver such
further instruments of assignment, transfer, conveyance, endorsement, direction
or authorization and other documents as the requesting party or parties or its
or their counsel may reasonably request in order to perfect title of the Buyers
and its successors and assigns to the Interests or otherwise to effectuate the
purposes of this Agreement.

SECTION 4.6. Reasonable Best Efforts. Upon the terms and subject to the
conditions of this Agreement, each of the parties hereto will use its reasonable
best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all action, and to do, or cause to
be done, all things necessary, proper or advisable consistent with applicable
law to consummate and make effective in the most expeditious manner practicable
the transactions contemplated hereby. The Sellers and the Buyers shall seek
early termination of the waiting period under the Hart Scott Rodino Antitrust
Improvements Act of 1976, as amended, and the rules and regulations thereunder
(the "HSR Act").

SECTION 4.7. Notice of Breach. Through the Closing Date, each of the parties
hereto shall promptly give to the other parties written notice with
particularity upon having knowledge of any matter that may constitute a breach
of any representation, warranty, agreement or covenant contained in this
Agreement. The Sellers shall have the right to supplement the Disclosure
Schedules with respect to any matter arising after the date hereof which would
have been required to be set forth on or described in such Disclosure Schedule
(a "Disclosure Schedule Update"). Any such supplemental disclosure will not be
deemed to have been disclosed as of the date of this Agreement for purposes of
determining whether the conditions set forth in Article V have been satisfied,
but such update shall be deemed to have cured any breach of representation,
warranty, covenant or agreement relating to the matters set forth in such update
for purposes of indemnification pursuant to Article VIII.

SECTION 4.8. Confidential Information. During the period commencing on the date
of this Agreement and ending on the second anniversary of the Closing Date
hereunder, except as required by law or stock exchange rule or under its
obligations pursuant to the Services Agreement (as defined in Section 5.9), the
Sellers and their affiliates shall not, directly or indirectly, disclose to any
person or entity or use any information not in the public domain or generally

Subsidiary, including but not limited to information regarding customers,

which is or was used by the Company or any Subsidiary, regardless of whether
such information was or is owned on the date hereof by the Company or any
Subsidiary (collectively, "Protected Information"); provided, however, that if
any of the Sellers or their affiliates are presently in possession of Protected
Information that (x) is necessary to use in the ordinary course of business of
Seller Parent or any controlled affiliate of Seller Parent other than the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries (collectively, "Seller Parent and its Other
Subsidiaries") and (y) cannot reasonably be redacted, segregated or otherwise
separated from information about or owned by Seller Parent and its Other
Subsidiaries which is necessary to use in the ordinary course of business of
Seller Parent and its Other Subsidiaries (hereinafter, "Mixed Information"),
then the Protected Information which is so imbedded in such Mixed Information
may be used by Seller Parent and its Subsidiaries in the ordinary course of
business; provided, that Seller Parent and its Subsidiaries may not use any such
Protected Information to compete or seek to compete with the business or
operations of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries. Upon the request of the
Company, Seller Parent and its Other Subsidiaries shall reasonably cooperate
with the Company in the development of procedures intended to further implement
the intent of this Section 4.8.

commencing on the date of this Agreement and ending on the second anniversary of
the Closing Date hereunder, neither the Sellers nor any affiliate thereof shall
for themselves or on behalf of or in conjunction with any person, directly or
indirectly, solicit, endeavor to entice away from the Company, or otherwise
directly or indirectly interfere with the relationship of the Company with any
person who, to the knowledge of the Sellers, is employed by the Company;
provided, however neither the Sellers nor any affiliates thereof shall be
precluded from soliciting or hiring any such employee (i) who initiates
discussions regarding such employment without any direct or indirect
solicitation by the Sellers; (ii) whose employment with the Company has been
terminated prior to commencement of employment with the Sellers; or (iii) who

a Transferred Employee.

(b) During the period commencing on the date of this Agreement and ending on the
second anniversary of the Closing Date hereunder, neither the Buyers nor any

Company with any person who, to the knowledge of the Sellers is, or was within
the then most recent 12 month period, a customer of the Company (hereinafter, a
"Company Customer"); provided, that, notwithstanding the foregoing, the Sellers
and their affiliates may solicit additional business from any Company Customer
who is then a customer of the Seller or any of its affiliates if such additional
business relates primarily to gas transportation or related services to be
provided by the Seller or such affiliate entirely within the geographic area in
which the Seller or such affiliate then conducts business or if such
solicitation would not otherwise compete with services which are provided by the
Company on the Closing Date to such Company Customer or any proposed expansion
or extension of such services to such Company Customer as contemplated on the
Closing Date.

(d) During the period commencing on the date of this Agreement and ending on the
second anniversary of the Closing Date hereunder, neither the Company nor any

Section 1.1502-6 or any similar provision of state or local law, but only to the
extent such liability relates to periods ending on or prior to the Closing Date.

related to the Company that are due on or prior to the Closing Date and shall
cause the Company to pay all Taxes due with respect to such Tax Returns. For all
other Tax Returns related to the Company for periods ending on or prior to the

terms and conditions set forth in the Services Agreement (as defined herein),
and (ii) submit such Tax Returns to the Buyers for signature, filing and payment
of Tax, all in accordance with the terms and conditions set forth in the
Services Agreement. The Sellers shall prepare and shall submit to the Buyers for
signature, filing and payment of Tax, all Straddle Tax Returns required to be
filed by the Company, provided, however, that the Sellers shall promptly
reimburse the Buyers for the portion of such Tax that relates to a Pre-Closing

Buyers will furnish to the Sellers all information and records reasonably
requested by the Sellers for use in preparation of any Tax Returns. The Sellers
shall allow the Buyers to review, comment upon and reasonably approve without
undue delay any Straddle Tax Return at any time during the 45-day period

filed on that basis. For purposes of this Agreement, "Pre-Closing Tax Period"
shall mean any taxable period ending on or before December 31, 2001 and the
portion ending on and including December 31, 2001 of any Straddle Period. For
purposes of this Agreement, "Straddle Period" shall mean any taxable period that

Date. For purposes of this Agreement, "Straddle Tax Return" shall mean any Tax
Return with respect to Taxes other than income taxes required to be filed by the
Company covering a taxable period commencing prior to December 31, 2001 and
ending after the Closing Date. The Sellers' covenants in respect of
responsibility for Taxes as set forth above in this Section 4.11(a) are in no
way intended to be duplicative of the adjustments reflected in the Purchase
Price pursuant to Section 1.4.

(b) The Sellers will cause any tax sharing agreement or similar arrangement with
respect to Taxes involving the Company or any Subsidiary to be terminated
effective as of the Closing Date, to the extent any such agreement or
arrangement relates to the Company or any Subsidiary, and after the Closing Date
neither the Company nor any Subsidiary shall have any obligation under any such
agreement or arrangement for any past, present or future period.

(c) All excise, sales, use, transfer (including real property transfer or
gains), stamp, documentary, filing, recordation and other similar taxes,
together with any interest, additions or penalties with respect thereto and any
interest in respect of such additions or penalties, resulting directly from the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement (the "Transfer Taxes"), shall be
borne by the party on which such Transfer Taxes are imposed by applicable law.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Section 4.11, any Tax Returns
that must be filed in connection with Transfer Taxes shall be prepared and filed
when due by the party primarily or customarily responsible under the applicable
local law for filing such Tax Returns, and such party will use reasonable
commercial efforts to provide such Tax Returns to the other party at least 10
days prior to the due date for such Tax Returns.

(d) The Sellers and the Buyers will use their  reasonable  best efforts to agree
on an  allocation  of the Purchase  Price within 90 days of the Closing Date and

Services Agreement). The costs for implementation of the Migration Plan shall be

performance bonds and bid bonds issued by the Seller and their affiliates (other
than the Company and its Subsidiaries) on behalf of the Company or any
Subsidiary. The Buyers shall use their reasonable best efforts to replace and
release the Bonds as promptly as reasonably practicable after the Closing Date

Schedule 2.22 (except the Directors and Officers Liability Policy) until their
scheduled expiration dates, for the proportionate premium cost of such Policies
as set forth on Schedule 2.22 for the period such Policies remain in effect. To
the extent after the Closing such Policies still cover the Company and its
Subsidiaries, the Company shall promptly notify the Sellers of any potential
claim or loss under such Policies and it shall be the Sellers' responsibility to
notify the insurance company of any claims or losses and to submit and
diligently pursue any claims or losses under such Policies with respect to the
Company and its Subsidiaries. The Buyers, the Company and its Subsidiaries agree
that they shall not notify the insurance company or submit any claim or loss to
the insurance company under such Policies. After the Closing, the Buyers, the
Company and its Subsidiaries shall be responsible for any deductible or
retention amounts with respect to claims or losses relating to the Company or
its Subsidiaries under such Policies.

the Company shall use their reasonable best efforts to seek amendments to each

Closing, the Buyers and the Company will have the right to request and receive,
and the other party thereto the obligation to perform, the services provided
therein in accordance with the terms of each request for service and the Master
Alliance Agreement; provided, however that the foregoing shall not obligate the
Sellers to incur any costs (other than nominal costs) to amend the terms of

without right to sublicense, in perpetuity to use, copy, and modify solely for
their internal business purposes in connection with the business of the Company,
all manuals, user guides, standards and operating procedures and similar

contemplated to be conducted in connection with the Expansion Projects, any and
all trademarks, service marks, and trade names owned by the Sellers and the
Sellers' affiliates solely to the extent appearing on existing inventory of the
Company and its Subsidiaries (such as on marketing and other materials),
advertisements, or property (such as on vehicles, equipment, pipelines and

Sellers' Marks are hereby reserved. Any inadvertent failure of the Buyers to
comply with their obligations under this provision shall not be a breach of this
Agreement unless the Buyers fail to use commercially reasonable efforts to
promptly remedy such failure after receipt of written notice from the Sellers or
to remedy such failure within 30 days of such notice, in which case the Sellers
may terminate this trademark license upon written notice to the Buyers and the
Company.

Company, the Buyers and their affiliates, a nonexclusive, royalty free,
perpetual license, without right to sublicense, to use, copy, modify, enhance,
and upgrade all computer software (object code and source code) owned by the
Sellers and/or the Sellers' affiliates and used in connection with the business
of the Company as presently conducted or as contemplated to be conducted in
connection with the Expansion Projects (the "Licensed Software") solely for
their internal business purposes. The modifications, enhancements and upgrades
made to the Licensed Software by the Buyers or the Company after the date of
delivery pursuant to the Migration Plan shall not infringe any intellectual
property or other proprietary rights of any third party. All copies of the
Licensed Software and related documentation must reproduce all copyright and
other intellectual property rights notices included thereon. As specified in the

to transfer to a third party (other than an affiliate of the Buyers or the
Company for use in accordance with the restrictions of this Section) any rights
in the Licensed Software except in connection with the sale or transfer of all
or substantially all of the Company's assets. The Company and the Buyers shall
not be entitled to receive, and Sellers and the Sellers' affiliates shall have
no obligation to provide, any modifications, enhancements, or upgrades made to
the Licensed Software which they develop subsequent to the delivery date;

the intellectual property rights in the Licensed Software; (c) the Company and
the Buyer have no rights in the Licensed Software except as expressly granted

action to be taken with respect to such intellectual property rights
inconsistent with the foregoing acknowledgment. The Sellers represent and
warrant that the Sellers or the Sellers' affiliates own all right, title and
interest in and to the Licensed Software or otherwise have the right to grant
the license granted herein and the Licensed Software does not infringe any third
party rights. Except as expressly provided in this Section 4.22, the Licensed
Software and associated materials are provided on an "as is" basis. The Sellers
and the Sellers' affiliates shall not be deemed to have made, and the Sellers
and the Sellers' affiliates hereby expressly disclaim, any implied guarantee or
implied warranty (whether arising under statute or otherwise in law or from a
course of dealing or usage of trade) as to the: (i) condition; (ii) design;
(iii) operation; (iv) performance; (v) reliability of the results generated or
output; (vi) non-infringement; (vii) merchantability; and (viii) fitness for a

the Sellers under Section 8.2(a)(iii);

(ii) no indemnification for any Losses asserted against the Buyers or the
Sellers, as the case may be, under Section 8.2(a) or Section 8.2(b) shall be
required unless and until the cumulative aggregate amount of such Losses exceeds
$8,000,000 (the "Threshold"), at which point the Sellers or the Buyers, as the
case may be, shall be obligated to indemnify the Indemnified Party (as
hereinafter defined) only as to the amount of such Losses in excess of
$1,000,000 (the "Deductible"), subject to the limitation in Section 8.2(c)(i);

Party (as hereinafter defined);

Sellers for breach or inaccuracy of any representation or breach of a warranty,
unless written notice of such claim or action is received by the Sellers
describing in reasonable detail the facts and circumstances with respect to the
subject matter of such claim or action on or prior to the date on which the
representation or warranty on which such claim or action is based ceases to
survive as set forth in Section 8.1 (it being agreed and understood that if a

representation or warranty shall survive until the date on which such claim is
finally liquidated or otherwise resolved), or (B) against the Buyers for breach
or inaccuracy of any representation or breach of a warranty, unless written
notice of such claim or action is received by the Buyers describing in

supporting a claim or action for indemnification under this Article VIII, and
shall provide to the Indemnifying Party as soon as practicable thereafter all
information and documentation reasonably necessary to support and verify any
Losses associated with such claim or action. Subject to Section 8.2(v), the
failure to so notify or provide information to the Indemnifying Party shall not
relieve the Indemnifying Party of any liability that it may have to any
Indemnified Party, except to the extent that the Indemnifying Party demonstrates
that it has been materially prejudiced by the Indemnified Party's failure to
give such notice, in which case the Indemnifying Party shall be relieved from
its obligations hereunder to the extent of such material prejudice. The
Indemnifying Party shall defend, contest or otherwise protect the Indemnified
Party against any such claim or action by counsel of the Indemnifying Party's
choice at its sole cost and expense; provided, however, that the Indemnifying
Party shall not make any settlement or compromise without the prior written
consent of the Indemnified Party (which consent shall not be unreasonably
withheld or delayed) unless the sole relief provided is monetary damages that
are paid in full by the Indemnifying Party. The Indemnified Party shall have the
right, but not the obligation, to participate at its own expense in the defense
thereof by counsel of the Indemnified Party's choice and shall in any event use
its reasonable best efforts to cooperate with and assist the Indemnifying Party.
If the Indemnifying Party fails timely to defend, contest or otherwise protect
against such suit, action, investigation, claim or proceeding, the Indemnified
Party shall have the right to do so, including, without limitation, the right to
make any compromise or settlement thereof, and the Indemnified Party shall be
entitled to recover the entire cost thereof from the Indemnifying Party,
including, without limitation, reasonable attorneys' fees, disbursements and
amounts paid as the result of such suit, action, investigation, claim or
proceeding.

SECTION 8.4. Remedy. Absent fraud, and except for seeking equitable relief, from
and after the Closing the sole remedy of a party in connection with (i) a breach
or inaccuracy of the representations, or breach of warranties, in this Agreement
or any certificates or other documents delivered pursuant to this Agreement on
Closing, or (ii) any failure by a party to perform or observe any term,
provision, covenant, or agreement on the part of such party to be performed or
observed under this Agreement, shall, in each case, be as set forth in this
Article VIII.

                                  ARTICLE IX.
