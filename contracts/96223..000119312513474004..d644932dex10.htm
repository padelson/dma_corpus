ARTICLE II.

 

PURCHASE AND SALE

 

Section 2.01. Purchase and Sale of LLC Interests. Subject to, and upon the
terms and conditions set forth in, this Agreement, at the Closing, in
consideration for payment of the Purchase Price, Seller agrees to sell,
transfer, assign, convey and deliver to Buyer, and Buyer agrees to purchase,
acquire and accept from Seller, all of Sellers right, title and interest
in and to the LLC Interests for the consideration specified in Section 2.02.

Section 2.02. Purchase Price. In consideration of the sale, transfer,
assignment conveyance and delivery of the LLC Interests pursuant to Section
2.01, the aggregate purchase price for the LLC Interests is an amount equal to
(a) $250.0 million, plus (b) the Estimated Working Capital Excess, if any,
less (c) the Estimated Working Capital Deficiency, if any (collectively and in
the aggregate, the "Purchase Price"), all subject to subsequent final
adjustment as provided in Section 2.04.

Section 2.03. Deposit. Concurrently with the execution and delivery of this
Agreement by the parties hereto, Buyer has deposited an amount in cash equal
to $17.5 million (such amount, including the interest accrued thereon at the
Applicable Rate, the "Deposit") by wire transfer of immediately available
funds to an account of Seller.  

Section 2.04. Working Capital Calculations.

 

(a) _Minimum Cage Cash_. At the Closing, the Company shall have cash on hand
in an amount not less than Minimum Cash on Hand, which amount shall be
inclusive of at least $2.0 million of Cage Cash or such greater amount
sufficient to meet the requirements of the Mississippi Gaming Commission and
under Gaming Laws (the "Minimum Cage Cash").

 

(b) _Cash Count_. At the Effective Time, or such other time reasonably agreed
to by the Company that will cause a minimal level of disruption to the
operations of the Business, Seller shall conduct a Cash count and the drop for
one hundred percent (100%) of the Companys gaming device "hoppers" and a
Representative of Buyer shall be present to observe such Cash count and
hopper drop if Buyer so elects. Such Cash count and hopper drop shall be
conclusive and binding upon Seller and Buyer and shall be used in the
preparation and determination of the Working Capital as of Closing.

 

(c) _Initial Working Capital_.

 

(i) During the ten-Business Day period prior to the Closing Date, Seller and
Buyer shall cooperate in good faith to review the information and data then
available and mutually agree on an estimated balance sheet of the Company as
of the Closing Date prepared in good faith and substantially in the form of
the Balance Sheet (the "Pre-Closing Balance 

 



17  Sheet"), a statement of Working Capital of the Company as of the Closing
Date based on the Pre-Closing Balance Sheet (the "Estimated Working Capital
Statement"), which shall quantify in reasonable detail the items constituting
such Working Capital, including the HR Transfer Fees paid or to be paid by the
Company or Seller prior to the Closing (the "Pre-Closing HR Transfer Fees")
and, if applicable, all unpaid Transaction Fees and unpaid Casualty Repair
Costs as of the Closing. The Pre-Closing Balance Sheet shall be prepared in
accordance with the Agreed Accounting Principles and shall be in substantially
the form of Section 2.04(a) of the Disclosure Schedules. The Estimated
Working Capital Statement will contain (i) a good faith estimate of the
aggregate amount of Working Capital of the Company as of the Closing Date (the
"Initial Working Capital"), and (ii) a statement of the amount by which (A)
the Initial Working Capital exceeds the Target Working Capital (such amount,
the "Estimated Working Capital Excess") or (B) the Target Working Capital
exceeds the Initial Working Capital (such amount, the "Estimated Working
Capital Deficiency"). Each of Buyer and Seller shall bear its own expenses in
the preparation and review of the Pre-Closing Balance Sheet, Estimated
Working Capital Statement and the Pre-Closing HR Transfer Fees. Section
2.04(a) of the Disclosure Schedules sets forth a sample calculation of Working
Capital, which is illustrative of the calculations used to arrive at
the Working Capital.

(ii) Seller will permit Buyer and its Representatives reasonable access to
Sellers and the Companys accountant work papers, books and records relating
to the calculation and preparation of the Pre-Closing Balance Sheet, Estimated
Working Capital Statement and the Pre-Closing HR Transfer Fees, and reasonable
access to the Companys accounting personnel and outside accountant who
assisted in the preparation of the foregoing. Prior to the Closing, the
parties will cooperate in good faith to resolve any disagreements concerning
the computation of any of the items included in the Pre-Closing Balance
Sheet, Estimated Working Capital Statement and the Pre-Closing HR Transfer
Fees; _provided_ , that it is acknowledged and agreed that if any
disagreements cannot be resolved, then the Closing will occur on the basis of
the Pre-Closing Balance Sheet, Estimated Working Capital Statement and the
Pre-Closing HR Transfer Fees determined by Seller in good faith (which Seller
will provide to Buyer at least five Business Days prior to the Closing Date),
and that any unresolved disagreements will be deferred for resolution
pursuant to the final adjustments using the Final Working Capital Adjustment
as provided for in Section 2.04(d).

 

(d) _Final Working Capital Adjustment_.

 

(i) As soon as reasonably practicable following the Closing Date, but in no
event later than sixty (60) days after the Closing Date, Buyer shall cause to
be prepared and delivered to Seller an unaudited balance sheet of the Company
as of the Closing Date in substantially the form of the Pre-Closing Balance
Sheet (the "Closing Balance Sheet"), a statement of Working Capital of the
Company as of the Closing Date in substantially the form of the Estimated
Working Capital Statement (the "Closing Statement"), which shall quantify in
reasonable detail the items constituting such Working Capital, including a
statement of the actual Transaction Expenses, the HR Transfer Fees and the
unpaid Casualty Repair Costs (if applicable). The Closing Balance Sheet shall
be prepared in accordance with the Agreed Accounting Principles and Section
2.04(a) of the Disclosure Schedules. The Closing Statement will set forth the
aggregate amount of Working Capital of the Company as of the Closing Date (the
"Closing Date Working Capital"). Each of Seller and Buyer shall bear its own
expenses in

 



18  the preparation and review of the Closing Balance Sheet and the Closing
Statement. Subject to applicable Law, Seller will provide Buyer reasonable
access to any of Sellers records to the extent such records are reasonably
related to the preparation of the foregoing items.

(ii) Seller shall have forty-five (45) days following the date of delivery by
Buyer to Seller of the Closing Balance Sheet and the Closing Statement (the
"Seller Review Period") to provide Buyer with a written certificate confirming
that the amounts and calculations set forth in such statements are correct
(the "Confirmation Certificate"). If Seller objects to any of the calculations
of Closing Date Working Capital or any element of the Closing Balance Sheet or
the Closing Statement, it shall, prior to the end of the Seller Review
Period, notify Buyer of such objection in writing (a "Balance Sheet Dispute
Notice"), setting forth in detail the particulars of such objection and
Sellers proposed adjustments to such amounts and calculations. During the
Seller Review Period, Buyer and the Company shall, during normal business
hours, upon reasonable advance notice and in a manner that does not materially
interfere with the business or operations of Buyer or the Company, provide
Seller with (A) such information as may be reasonably requested by Seller with
respect to its review of the Closing Balance Sheet and the Closing Statement,
including all relevant accounting work papers and (B) reasonable access
to the Companys accounting personnel and outside accountant who developed
the Closing Balance Sheet and other information contained in such statements.
In the event that Seller does not provide a Balance Sheet Dispute Notice by
the end of the Seller Review Period, Seller shall be deemed to have accepted
the Closing Statement and the calculation of the Closing Date Working Capital
delivered by Buyer, which shall each be final, binding and conclusive for
purposes of this Agreement and not subject to any further recourse against
Seller under any provision hereof, except as set forth in Section 9.02. In the
event any Balance Sheet Dispute Notice is timely delivered, Buyer and Seller
shall use their commercially reasonable efforts for a period of thirty (30)
days from the date of first delivery of the Balance Sheet Dispute Notice (or
such longer period as they may mutually agree) to resolve the disagreements
identified in the Balance Sheet Dispute Notice. If, at the end of such
period, they are unable to resolve such disagreements, then such disagreements
shall be submitted for resolution to an impartial nationally recognized firm
of independent certified public accountants other than Sellers Accountants
or Buyers Accountants, appointed by mutual agreement of Buyer and Seller (the
"Independent Accountants") who, acting as experts and not arbitrators, shall
resolve any such remaining disagreements. To the extent any disagreement is
not described in the Balance Sheet Dispute Notice, then all items included in
the calculation of the Closing Date Working Capital that are not subject to
any such disagreement will be deemed to be final, binding and conclusive
for purposes of this Agreement and not subject to any further recourse
against Seller under any provision of this Agreement, except as set forth in
Section 9.02. The parties will take actions reasonably available to them to
cause the Independent Accountants to determine as promptly as practicable,
but in no event more than thirty (30) days after the submission of such
dispute to the Independent Accountants, whether the Closing Statement and
other items, if applicable, were prepared in accordance with the standards
set forth in this Agreement and, only with respect to the disagreements
submitted to the Independent Accountants, whether and to what extent (if any)
the Closing Date Working Capital requires adjustment within the range between
Buyers calculation and Sellers respective calculations. The parties shall
each use commercially reasonable efforts to cause the Independent Accountants
to promptly deliver to Buyer and Seller their determination in writing (along
with a statement of reasons therefor), which determination shall be made
subject to the definitions and principles set forth in this Agreement. The
fees and

 



19  costs of the Independent Accountants shall be payable one half (1/2) by
Seller, on the one hand, and one half (1/2) by Buyer, on the other hand. The
determination made by the Independent Accountants shall be final, binding and
conclusive for purposes of this Agreement and not subject to any further
recourse by Buyer or Seller under any provision hereof, except as set forth in
Section 9.02. The date on which the Closing Date Working Capital and such
other calculations, if applicable, are finally determined in accordance with
this Section 2.04 is hereinafter referred to as the "Determination Date".

 

(iii) Within five (5) Business Days following the Determination Date, the
following payments shall be made: the absolute value of the amount (which may
be a positive or negative number) equal to (1) the Closing Date Working
Capital _less_ (2) the Initial Working Capital (the "Final Working Capital
Adjustment") shall be paid (along with interest, at the Applicable Rate, from
the Closing Date through the payment date) in cash by wire transfer of
immediately available funds from Buyer to Seller (if the Final Working Capital
Adjustment is a positive amount), or by Seller to Buyer (if the Final Working
Capital Adjustment is a negative amount) to an account specified in a written
instruction from Buyer or Seller, as applicable.

 

(e) _Adjustments for Tax Purposes_. Any payments made pursuant to this Section
2.04 shall be treated as an adjustment to the Purchase Price by the parties
for Tax purposes, unless otherwise required by Law.

(f) In the event of the occurrence of any Casualty Event that has not been
remedied prior to the Closing Date, the time periods for determining the Final
Working Capital Adjustment related to any Casualty Repair Costs may be
extended for such reasonable period of time as determined by Buyer in
good faith upon notice to Seller to permit the Parties to determine the
actual amount of Casualty Repair Costs incurred or to be incurred and the
amount of insurance proceeds to be recovered with respect thereto.

 

Section 2.05. Excluded Assets. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
contained in this Agreement, (a)(i) all Cash (other than the Minimum Cash on
Hand), including all checking accounts, bank accounts, deposit accounts,
certificates of deposit, time deposits, securities and uncashed checks
received by the Company on or prior to the Closing Date and all interest
and dividends thereon (provided that the amounts thereof have not been
applied to reduce payables or liabilities included in Working Capital) and
(ii) the assets set forth on Section 2.05 of the Disclosure Schedules
(collectively the "Excluded Assets") shall either (A) be assigned or
distributed by the Company to Seller prior to the Closing or (B) in the case
of the Excluded Assets specified in clause (i), if not so assigned or
distributed, shall be taken into account in determining the calculation of
Working Capital. The parties acknowledge and agree that the Company shall have
not less than the Minimum Cash on Hand as of the Closing, the amount of which
will be included as a current asset for purposes of calculating the Closing
Date Working Capital. Buyer acknowledges and agrees that neither the Company
nor Seller owns the collection of rock and roll memorabilia located at the
Biloxi Property that are owned by Hard Rock Cafe International (STP), Inc.
and are leased to the Company pursuant to the terms and conditions of the
Memorabilia Lease.

 

Section 2.06. Purchase Price Allocation. Section 2.06 of the Disclosure
Schedules sets forth the parties good faith estimate of an allocation as of
the Closing Date of the total Purchase

 



20  Price as computed for Tax purposes among all of the assets of the Company
pursuant to the methodology prescribed by Section 1060 of the Code and the
Treasury Regulations thereunder (and any similar provision of applicable Law)
(the "Allocation Schedule"). Within 60 days following the Closing Date, Buyer
will prepare and deliver to Seller a revised Allocation Schedule for approval.
Buyer and Seller will act in good faith and reasonably cooperate with each
other to agree on the Allocation Schedule within 45 days following Sellers
receipt of the revised Allocation Schedule. If Buyer and Seller are unable to
agree on an Allocation Schedule during such 45-day period, Buyer and Seller
will jointly engage the Independent Accountants to prepare the Allocation
Schedule and will direct the Independent Accountants to provide its Allocation
Schedule within 30 days of its engagement. The Allocation Schedule as
determined either by the parties or the Independent Accountants pursuant to
the two immediately preceding sentences (the "Final Allocation Schedule") will
be binding on Buyer and Seller for all Tax and financial accounting purposes
(unless otherwise required by a "determination" within the meaning of Section
1313(a) of the Code). Seller will timely and properly prepare, execute, file
and deliver all such documents, forms and other information as Buyer may
reasonably request to prepare the Allocation Schedule. None of Buyer, the
Company, Seller or any of Sellers Representatives will take any position
(whether in audits, Tax Returns, including IRS Form 8594, financial accounting
or otherwise) that is inconsistent with the Allocation Schedule as determined
pursuant to this Section 2.06 unless required to do so by applicable Law.

 

Section 2.07. Withholding. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary,
Buyer shall be entitled to deduct and withhold, or cause to be deducted and
withheld, from amounts otherwise payable to any Person pursuant to this
Agreement such amounts as Buyer is required to deduct and withhold with
respect to the making of such payment under the Code, or any provision of
state, local or foreign Tax Law; _provided_ , _however_ , Buyer shall provide
written notice at least ten Business Days prior to the applicable payment date
that such Persons that may be subject to Buyers deduction and withholding.
To the extent that amounts are so withheld by Buyer, such withheld amounts
shall be (a) paid over to the applicable Tax authority in accordance with
applicable Law and (b) treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having
been paid to such Person in respect of which such deduction and withholding
was made by Buyer.

Property") and (ii) the legal description of each parcel of leased Real
Property, and a list, as of the Signing Date, of all leases for each parcel of
leased Real Property in which either Seller, the Company or a Company
Subsidiary is the lessee (collectively, the "Ground Leases"), including the
identification of the lessee and lessor thereunder. The Company or a Company
Subsidiary has good and marketable fee simple title to all the Owned Real
Property and fee simple title to all buildings, structures and other
improvements thereon and all fixtures thereto, subject only to Permitted
Encumbrances, and an insurable leasehold interest in all Real Property leased
pursuant to the Ground Leases (the "Ground Leased Property"). With respect to
the Owned Real Property and the Ground Leased Property, Seller has delivered
or made available to Buyer true, complete and correct copies of the

 



30  deeds, leases and other instruments (as recorded) by which the Company
acquired such Owned Real Property and the Ground Leased Property.

 

(b) All Ground Leases are valid and in full force and effect in accordance
with their terms. Seller has delivered or made available to Buyer, true,
complete and correct copies of the Ground Leases. There is not under any
Ground Lease (i) any material default (or any claimed default) by the Company
or a Company Subsidiary, or any event of default or event which with notice or
lapse of time, or both, would constitute a default by the Company and in
respect of which the Company or a Company Subsidiary has not taken adequate
steps to prevent a default on its part from occurring, or (ii) to the
Knowledge of Seller, as of the Signing Date, any existing material default by
any other party to any Ground Lease, or any event of default or event which
with notice or lapse of time, or both, would constitute a default by any other
party to any Ground Lease.

 

(c) None of Seller, the Company or a Company Subsidiary has received any
notice that the owner of any leased Real Property has made any assignment,
pledge, or hypothecation of the Ground Lease with respect thereto or the rents
or use fees due thereunder.

(d) Except for the Owned Real Property and the Ground Leased Property,
neither the Company nor any Company Subsidiary has had, beneficially or of
record, any interest (including leasehold, subleasehold or license interests)
in real property. With respect to each parcel of Owned Real Property or
Ground Leased Property, (i) there is no pending or, to Sellers Knowledge,
threatened dispute in connection with such parcel relating to the boundary
lines, ingress and egress, adverse possession or similar issues, (ii) there
are no outstanding options, rights of first refusal or similar rights (other
than the HR Licensing ROFR) with respect to any such parcel or any portion
thereof or interest therein, and (iii) no condemnation Proceeding is pending
or, to the Knowledge of Seller, threatened which would impair the occupancy,
use or value of any Real Property or any Ground Leased Property.

 

(e) Section 4.10(e) of the Disclosure Schedules lists each lease in which the
Company or any Company Subsidiary is the lessor (the "Company Leases"). The
Company or a Company Subsidiary is the sole owner of the entire landlords
interest in all of the Company Leases. Neither the Company Leases nor any
interests therein have been assigned to any Person. There exist no uncured
material defaults by the Company or a Company Subsidiary under any of the
Company Leases, or any event of default or event which with notice or lapse of
time, or both, would constitute a material default by the Company or
a Company Subsidiary and, to the Knowledge of Seller, as of the Signing Date,
there exist no uncured material defaults by any tenant under any of the
Company Leases, or any event of default or event which with notice or lapse of
time, or both, would constitute a material default by any other party to any
Lease. No tenant has any claim, offset or defense to payment of rent under the
Company Leases. None of the rents relating to the Company Leases has been
assigned. No Person has the right to occupy any portion of the Owned Real
Property except pursuant to the Company Leases.

(f) Except as set forth in Section 4.10(f) of the Disclosure Schedules, the
condition and use of the Owned Real Property and the Ground Leased Property
conforms to each applicable certificate of occupancy and all other Permits
required to be issued in connection with the Owned Real Property or the
Ground Leased Property, as applicable, except where the failure

 



31  to be in compliance would not individually or in the aggregate reasonably be
expected to result in a material loss or expense to the Company or any Company
Subsidiary. The Company has made available to Buyer (i) all valid policies of
title insurance insuring the Companys or a Company Subsidiarys fee simple or
other title to the Owned Real Property or the Ground Leased Property and such
policies are in full force and effect and no material claim has been made
against any such policy and (ii) all existing surveys and plans of the Owned
Real Property or the Ground Leased Property. Neither the Company nor any
Company Subsidiary is in violation or breach of or default under any
declaration, covenant, condition or restriction affecting the Owned Real
Property or the Ground Leased Property, except where the failure to be in
compliance would not individually or in the aggregate reasonably be expected
to result in a material loss or expense to the Company or any Company
Subsidiary.

the assets, properties and rights necessary to allow Buyer immediately after

or Encumbrances that, individually or in the aggregate, do not have, or would
not reasonably be expected to have, a Material Adverse Effect.

 

(c) To the Knowledge of Seller, the Intellectual Property as currently owned,

that could reasonably be expected to adversely affect the status of any such
qualification, cause the revocation of such determination letter from the
Internal Revenue Service or cause the unavailability of reliance on such
opinion letter from the Internal Revenue Service, as applicable. All material
benefits, contributions and premiums relating to each Benefit Plan or
applicable Law have been timely paid in accordance with the terms of such
Benefit Plan, all applicable Laws and GAAP. All material reports, returns and
similar documents required to be filed with any Governmental Authority or
distributed to any Benefit Plan participant have been duly filed or
distributed. To Sellers Knowledge, no "prohibited transaction" or "reportable
event" has occurred within the meaning of the applicable provisions of ERISA
or the Code with respect to any Benefit Plan and there have been no breaches
of any of the duties imposed by ERISA on "fiduciaries" (within the meaning of
Section 3(21) of ERISA) with respect to any Benefit Plan.

(d) Neither the Company, any Company Subsidiary nor any of their respective
ERISA Affiliates has ever maintained, sponsored or contributed to, or had any
obligation to maintain, sponsor or contribute to, or had any actual or
contingent liability with respect to, a "defined benefit plan" (as defined in
Section 3(35) of ERISA), an arrangement subject to the minimum funding
standards of Section 302 of ERISA or Section 412 of the Code, a "multiemployer
plan" (as defined in Section 3(37) of ERISA or Section 414(f) of the Code) or
a "multiple employer plan" (within the meaning of Section 210(a) of ERISA or
Section 413(c) of the Code). None of Seller, Sellers Affiliates, the Company
or any Company Subsidiary: (i) has withdrawn from any pension plan
under circumstances resulting (or expected to result) in any liability to the
Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation; or (ii) has engaged in any transaction
which would reasonable be expected to give rise to any liability of the
Company, any Company Subsidiary or Buyer under Section 4069 or Section
4212(c) of ERISA.

(e) Other than as required under COBRA or other applicable Law, no Benefit
Plan provides, and neither the Company nor any Company Subsidiary has any
obligation to provide, or any actual or contingent liability with respect to,
any benefits or coverage in the nature of health, life or disability
insurance, or any other health or welfare benefits of any kind, in any case,
following retirement or other termination of employment or service (other than
death benefits when termination occurs upon death). With respect to each group
health plan benefiting any current or former employee or other service
provider of the Company or any Company Subsidiary that is subject to COBRA,
the Company, the Company Subsidiaries and each of their respective ERISA
Affiliates have complied in all material respects with the continuation
coverage requirements of COBRA.

(f) (i) To Sellers Knowledge, no Benefit Plan is the subject of
an examination, investigation or audit by a Governmental Authority; and (ii)
there is no pending or, to Sellers Knowledge, threatened action, complaint,
assessment, investigation, lawsuit or other Proceeding (other than routine
claims for benefits in the ordinary course of business).

(g) Neither the execution of this Agreement nor the consummation of the
Transactions could, either alone or together with any other event, condition
or circumstance (including termination of employment or service): (i) result
in the payment of any money or other property, or the provision of any
benefit, to any current or former employee, manager,

 



37  director, officer, consultant, independent contractor or other service
provider of the Company or any Company Subsidiary, or increase the value of
any payment or benefit to any such Person; (ii) accelerate the payment or
vesting of any, or provide any additional, rights or benefits (including
funding of compensation or benefits through a trust or otherwise) to, any
current or former employee, manager, director, officer, consultant,
independent contractor or other service provider of the Company or any Company
Subsidiary; or (iii) result in the forgiveness in whole or in part of any
outstanding loans made by the Company or any Company Subsidiary to any
Person. 

(h) The Company and each Company Subsidiary have reserved the right to amend
or terminate each Benefit Plan at any time without the consent of any Person.

(i) All (i) insurance premiums required to be paid with respect to, (ii)
benefits, expenses, and other amounts due and payable under, and (iii)
contributions, transfers, or payments required to be made to, any Benefit Plan
under the applicable arrangement, applicable Law or otherwise have been paid,
made or accrued in accordance with the applicable arrangement or applicable
Law. No Benefit Plan provides benefits to any Person who is neither a current
nor former employee, director or consultant of the Company or any Company
Subsidiary, or a dependent or other beneficiary of any such Person. No
Benefit Plan is maintained outside of the United States.

(j) No Benefit Plan provides any Person with a "gross up" or similar payment
in respect of any Taxes that may become payable under or in connection with
Section 409A or Section 4999 of the Code. With respect to each Benefit Plan
that is a "nonqualified deferred compensation plan" within the meaning of
Section 409A(d)(1) of the Code and is subject to Section 409A of the Code, (i)
the written terms of such arrangement have at all times since January 1, 2010
been in compliance with, and (ii) such arrangement has, at all times while
subject to Section 409A of the Code, been operated in good faith compliance
with, Section 409A of the Code and applicable guidance thereunder.

 

(k) Neither the execution of this Agreement nor the consummation of the
Transactions, whether alone or together with any other event, condition or
circumstance (including termination of employment or service), could result in
any "excess parachute payments" within the meaning of Section 280G(b) of the
Code.

 

(l) Except for Sections 4.03(b), 4.06, 4.07, 4.20, 4.21 and 4.22, the
representations and warranties set forth in this Section 4.19 are Sellers
sole and exclusive representations and warranties regarding employee benefit

have been no labor strikes, disputes, slow-downs, work stoppages, lockouts,
labor organization drives or similar disputes against or concerning the
Company, any

 



38  Company Subsidiary or any of their respective employees or other service
providers, and none of the foregoing are pending or, to Sellers Knowledge,

safety, plant closings, layoffs, employee and independent contractor
classifications, work authorization, immigration, affirmative action,

Subsidiary are correctly classified as employees, independent contractors or
otherwise for all purposes (including any applicable Tax and employment
policies or Law). The Company and each Company Subsidiary are, and have at all
times been, in compliance with both the employment verification provisions
(including the paperwork and documentation requirements) and the anti-
discrimination provisions of Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986. The
Company and each Company Subsidiary are not, and have not been, delinquent in
any payments to, or on behalf of, any current or former employee, independent
contractor or other service provider (including any applicable insurance
contributions or tax payments due to a Governmental Authority). No employee of
the Company or any Company Subsidiary is based outside of the United States.
The employment of each of the employees of the Company and each Company
Subsidiary is "at will."

 

(c) Except as set forth in Section 4.20(c) of the Disclosure Schedules and as,

reasonably be expected to result in material liability to the Company or any
Company Subsidiary, as of the Signing Date, there are no Proceedings against
the Company or any Company Subsidiary pending, or to Sellers
Knowledge, threatened to be brought or filed, by or with any Governmental
Authority or arbitrator in connection with the employment or service of any
current or former employee or other service provider of the Company or any
Company Subsidiary (or applicant for any such position, or any class of any
of the foregoing), including any claim relating to unfair labor practices,
employment discrimination, harassment, retaliation, equal pay or any other
employment related matter arising under applicable Laws. The Company and each
Company Subsidiary have not and are not engaged in any unfair labor practice.

(d) Neither the Company nor any Company Subsidiary is liable for any payment
of a material amount to any trust or other fund or to any Governmental
Authority with respect to unemployment compensation benefits, social security
or other benefits for employees (other than routine payments to be made in
the ordinary course of business consistent with past practice). Neither the
Company nor any Company Subsidiary has engaged in any activities that could
reasonably be expected to result in any liabilities under the WARN Act. 

(e) Section 4.20(e) of the Disclosure Schedules sets forth the name and
current annual salary and anticipated 2013 bonus of all employees of the

employment agreement, nondisclosure agreement, common law nondisclosure
obligation, fiduciary duty, non-competition agreement, restrictive covenant or
other obligation to a concurrent or former employer or other service
recipient relating to the right of such employee or other service provider to
be employed by or provide services to the Company or any Company Subsidiary,
or such Persons knowledge or use of trade secrets or proprietary information.

Except as set forth in the Disclosure Schedules or in any documents referred

Section 5.01. Organization and Authority of Buyer. Buyer is a corporation
duly organized, validly existing and in good standing under the Laws of the
state of Delaware. Buyer has all necessary corporate power and authority to

other Transaction Documents to which it is, or is specified to be, a party,
will be duly executed and delivered. Assuming due authorization, execution and
delivery by Seller, this Agreement and each of the other
Transaction Documents to which Buyer is or is specified to be, a party,
constitutes a legal, valid and binding obligation of Buyer enforceable against
Buyer in accordance with its terms, except as such enforceability may be
limited by bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium or similar Laws
affecting creditors rights generally and by general principles of equity
(regardless of whether enforcement is sought in a proceeding at law or in
equity.

conflict with or result in a violation or breach of, or default under, any
provision of the Organizational Documents of Buyer; (ii) conflict with or
result in a violation or breach of any provision of any Law or Governmental
Order applicable to Buyer; or (iii) require the consent, notice or other
action by any Person under any material Contract to which Buyer is a party,
except in the cases of clauses (ii) and (iii), where such conflicts,
violations, breaches or defaults would not, individually or in the aggregate,
reasonably be expected to materially impair or delay the ability of Buyer to
perform its obligations under this Agreement and each other Transaction
Document to which it is, or is specified to be, a party.

 

(b) Except as set forth in Section 8.01(c)(2) of the Disclosure Schedules, no
consent, approval, Permit, Governmental Order, declaration or filing with, or
notice to, any Governmental Authority or any other Person is required by or
with respect to Buyer in connection with the execution and delivery of this
Agreement, the other Transaction Documents to which it is, or is specified to

expiration or termination of the applicable waiting period thereunder, (iv)
such consents, approvals, Permits, Governmental Orders, declarations, filings
or notices which, individually or in the aggregate, would not (A) result in,
or reasonably be expected to result in, a Material Adverse Effect or (B)
materially impair the ability of Buyer to perform its obligations under this
Agreement and each other Transaction Document to which it is, or is specified
to be, a party, and (v) such consents, approvals, Permits, Governmental
Orders, declarations, filings or notices which may be required solely by
reason of Sellers, as opposed to any other third partys participation in the
Transactions (which are the obligation of Seller to obtain).

Section 5.03. Investment Purpose. Buyer is acquiring the LLC Interests solely
for its own account for investment purposes and not with a view to, or for
offer or sale in connection with, any distribution thereof. Buyer acknowledges
that the LLC Interests are not registered under the Securities Act or any

sold except pursuant to the registration provisions of the Securities Act
pursuant to an applicable exemption therefrom and subject to state securities
laws and regulations, as applicable.

 

Section 5.04. Brokers. No broker, finder or investment banker is entitled to
any brokerage, finders or other fee or commission in connection with the
Transactions based upon arrangements made by or on behalf of Buyer or Buyer
Parent.

 



43 Section 5.05. Sufficiency of Funds.

 

(a) Buyer has delivered to Seller a true and complete copy of the Financing
Commitment. As of the Signing Date, the Financing Commitment has not been
amended or modified, no such amendment or modification is contemplated (other
than amendments or modifications permitted by Section 6.23), and, to Buyers
Knowledge, none of the respective obligations and commitments contained in
the Financing Commitment has been withdrawn, terminated or rescinded in any
respect. Buyer has fully paid any and all commitment fees or other fees in
connection with the Financing Commitment that are payable on or prior to the
Signing Date. Assuming (i) the Financing is funded in accordance with the
Financing Commitment, (ii) the accuracy in all material respects of the
representations and warranties set forth in Article IV hereof, and (iii)
compliance by Seller and the Company with their covenants under this
Agreement, the net proceeds contemplated by the Financing Commitment, together
with Buyers cash on hand, will in the aggregate be sufficient for Buyer to
pay each of the amounts required to be paid by Buyer in connection with the
consummation of the Transactions and to pay all related fees and expenses of
Buyer. The Financing Commitment is (A) a legal, valid and binding obligation
of Buyer and, to the Knowledge of Buyer, each of the other parties thereto,
and (B) enforceable in accordance with its terms against Buyer and, to the
Knowledge of Buyer, each of the other parties thereto, subject, as to clause
(B), to bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium or similar Laws
affecting creditors rights generally and by general principles of equity
(regardless of whether enforcement is sought in a proceeding at law or in
equity). As of the Signing Date, no event has occurred which, with or
without notice, lapse of time or both, would or would reasonably be expected
to constitute a default or breach on the part of Buyer or, to the Knowledge of
Buyer, any other parties thereto under the Financing Commitment; _provided_
that Buyer is not making any representation or warranty regarding the effect
of (x) any inaccuracy in the representations and warranties set forth in
Article IV or (y) the failure by Seller or the Company to comply with any
covenant herein. There are no conditions precedent or other contingencies
related to the funding of the Financing on the Closing Date, other than as
expressly set forth in the Financing Commitment. As of the Signing Date, there
are no Contracts (whether oral or written) or commitments to enter into any
Contracts (whether oral or written) to which Buyer or any of its Affiliates is
a party related to the Financing other than as expressly contained in the
Financing Commitment and delivered to Seller prior to or simultaneously with
the execution of this Agreement. Buyer acknowledges and agrees that Buyers
obligations under this Agreement are not subject to any conditions regarding
Buyers, its Affiliates or any other Persons ability to obtain financing
for the consummation of the Transactions.

(b) Assuming the accuracy of Sellers representations and warranties in
Article IV, immediately after giving effect to the Transactions, each of Buyer
and the Company shall be solvent and shall: (i) be able to pay its debts as
they become due; (ii) own property that has a fair saleable value
greater than the amounts required to pay its debts (including a reasonable
estimate of the amount of all contingent liabilities); and (iii) have adequate
capital to carry on its business. No transfer of property is being made and no
obligation is being incurred in connection with the Transactions with the
intent to hinder, delay or defraud either present or future creditors of any
of Buyer or the Company. In connection with the Transactions, Buyer has not
incurred, nor plans to incur, debts beyond its ability to pay as they become
absolute and matured.

 



44 Section 5.06. Ability to Bear Risk. The financial condition of Buyer is such
that it can afford to (a) bear the economic risk of holding the LLC Interests
for an indefinite period and (b) suffer the complete loss of its investment in
the LLC Interests.

 

Section 5.07. Licensability of Licensing Affiliates; Required Licensees.

 

(a) Solely with respect to the businesses of Buyer Parent and its
subsidiaries, as of the Signing Date, Buyer, Buyer Parent, and each of
their respective Affiliates and each of their respective Representatives
(each, a "Licensed Party" and collectively, the "Licensed Parties") who are
required to be licensed or found suitable under applicable Laws hold
all material Permits, findings of suitability, variances, exemptions or
certificates of occupancy of or from all Governmental Authorities under all
applicable Laws necessary to conduct the current business and operations of
Buyer Parent and its subsidiaries, each of which is in full force and effect
in all material respects as of the Signing Date (collectively, the "Buyer
Permits"), and, as of the Signing Date, no event has occurred that (with or
without the giving of notice or passage time, or both) permits revocation,
non-renewal, modification, suspension, limitation or termination of any Buyer
Permits held by a Licensed Party, except in each case for such exceptions that
would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to
materially impair or delay the ability of Buyer or Buyer Parent to perform
their respective obligations under this Agreement and each other Transaction
Document to which each is, or is specified to be, a party. To the Knowledge
of Buyer, as of the Signing Date, there is no reason for the Gaming
Authorities not to grant all required Gaming Approvals or refuse to grant any
finding of suitability with respect to Buyer.

 

(b) To the Knowledge of Buyer, as of the Signing Date, there are no facts,
that if known to the Gaming Authority, would (i) reasonably be expected to
result in the denial, revocation, limitation or suspension of a Gaming
Approval with respect to Buyer or Buyer Parent, any of its principals,
Representatives or Affiliates, or any of its or their respective officers,
directors, key employees or Persons performing management functions similar
to an officer (such Persons, the "Licensing Affiliates"), (ii) reasonably be
expected to result in a negative outcome to any finding of suitability
proceedings currently pending, or under the suitability proceedings necessary
to obtain a Gaming Approval required to consummate the Transactions, or (iii)
reasonably be expected to cause a material delay under any suitability
proceeding required by a Gaming Authority to consummate the Transactions.

Affiliate that Buyer believes must obtain a Gaming Approval in order to
consummate the Transactions (together, the "Required Licensees").

(c) As of the Signing Date, none of the Required Licensees has ever been
arrested, detained, charged, indicted or convicted or pleaded guilty or nolo
contendere or forfeited bail in connection with any criminal offense under the
laws of any jurisdiction, whether such criminal offense constitutes a felony
or misdemeanor (except for traffic violations).

Section 5.08. Compliance with Gaming Laws. Solely with respect to the
businesses of Buyer Parent and its subsidiaries, other than routine matters
in connection with updating of Licensing Affiliates disclosure obligations in
the States of Rhode Island and Colorado and matters in connection with
obtaining Gaming Approvals, as of the Signing Date, neither Buyer, its
Affiliates, nor, to the Knowledge of Buyer, any Licensing Affiliate, has
received notice of any

 



45  pending investigation or review by any Gaming Authority with respect to
Buyer, Buyer Parent and each of their respective Affiliates, any of the
Licensing Affiliates, or any of their respective officers, directors, key
employees or Persons performing management functions similar to an officer. To
the Knowledge of Buyer, as of the Signing Date, (a) no such investigation or
review is threatened, (b) no Gaming Authority has indicated any intention to
conduct the same, and (c) there are no facts that, if known to a Gaming
Authority, will or would reasonably be expected to give rise to any inquiry or
investigation, or to result in the revocation, limitation or suspension of a
license issued to such Persons by an applicable Gaming Authority. Solely with
respect to the businesses of Buyer Parent and its subsidiaries, other than
routine matters in connection with updating of Licensing
Affiliates disclosure obligations in the States of Rhode Island and Colorado
and matters in connection with obtaining Gaming Approvals, as of the Signing
Date, neither Buyer, any of its Affiliates, nor, to the Knowledge of Buyer,
any Licensed Party or director, officer, key employee or partner of a
Licensed Party has suffered a suspension or revocation of any license issued
to such Persons by an applicable Gaming Authority.

 

Section 5.09. Gaming Laws. This Agreement is subject to the Gaming Laws and
the Liquor Laws. Without limiting the foregoing, Buyer acknowledges that all
rights, remedies and powers under this Agreement, including ownership and
operation of the gaming facilities, and the possession or control of gaming
equipment, alcoholic beverages or a gaming or liquor license, may
be exercised only to the extent that the exercise thereof does not violate
any applicable provisions of the Gaming Laws and Liquor Laws and only to the
extent that required approvals (including prior approvals) are obtained from
the requisite Governmental Authority. Buyer acknowledges and agrees that the
sale, assignment, transfer, pledge or other disposition of the LLC Interests
is ineffective unless approved in advance by the Gaming Authorities. If at any
time a Gaming Authority finds that an owner of the LLC Interests is
unsuitable to continue to have an involvement in gaming, such owner must
dispose of such security as provided by the Gaming Laws. Buyer acknowledges
that the Gaming Laws and regulations restrict the right under certain
circumstances: (a) to pay or receive any dividend or interest upon such
security; (b) to exercise, directly or through any trustee or nominee, any
voting right conferred by such security; or (c) to receive any remuneration
in any form from the Company, for services rendered or otherwise.

Section 5.10. Hard Rock Intellectual Property. Buyer acknowledges that
certain Intellectual Property used in connection with the Business, including
the name "Hard Rock Hotel and Casino," is not owned by the Company, but is
licensed for use by the Company pursuant to the Hard Rock License Agreement.

Section 5.11. Legal Proceedings. As of the Signing Date, there are no
Proceedings pending or, to Buyers Knowledge, threatened against or by Buyer
or any Affiliate of Buyer (including Buyer Parent) that challenge or seek to
prevent, enjoin or otherwise delay the Transactions. To Buyers Knowledge, as
of the Signing Date, no event has occurred or circumstances exist that may
give rise or serve as a basis for any such Proceeding.

Section 5.12. Disclaimer of Other Representations or Warranties. Buyer does
not make and has not made any representations or warranties in connection with

COVENANTS

 

Section 6.01. Conduct of Business Prior to the Closing. From the Signing Date
until the Closing, except as expressly provided in this Agreement or
consented to in writing by Buyer, Seller shall, and shall cause the Company
to: (a) conduct the Business in the ordinary course of business; and (b) use
commercially reasonable efforts to maintain and preserve intact the current
organization, the Business and franchise of the Company and to preserve the
rights, franchises, goodwill and relationships of its employees, customers,
lenders, suppliers, regulators and others having business relationships with
the Company. From the Signing Date until the Closing Date, except as
consented to in writing by Buyer (which consent shall not be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned or delayed with respect to the matters set forth in
clauses (f), (g), (i), (j), (l), (p), (r) or (t) of Section 4.07), Seller
shall not cause or permit the Company or any Company Subsidiary to take any
action that would cause any of the changes, events or conditions described in
Section 4.07 to occur. 

Section 6.02. Access to Information. From the Signing Date until the Closing,
Seller shall, and shall cause the Company and the Company Subsidiaries to:
(a) afford Buyer and its Representatives reasonable access to and the right to
inspect all of the Real Property, properties, assets, premises, books and
records, contracts, agreements, insurance arrangements and outstanding claims
and other documents and data related to the Company; (b) furnish Buyer and its
Representatives with such financial, operating and other data and information
related to the Company as Buyer or any of its Representatives may reasonably
request; and (c) instruct the Representatives of Seller and the Company to
cooperate with Buyer in its investigation of the Company; _provided, however_
, that any such investigation shall be conducted during normal business hours
upon reasonable advance notice to Seller, under the supervision of Sellers
personnel and in such a manner as not to interfere with the normal operations
of the Company. All requests by Buyer for access pursuant to this Section
6.02 shall be submitted or directed exclusively to David Severn or such other
individuals as Seller may designate in writing from time to time.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, neither Seller nor
the Company shall be required to disclose any information to Buyer if such
disclosure would, in Sellers good faith judgment: (i) cause significant
competitive harm to Seller, the Company and their respective businesses if the
Transactions are not consummated; (ii) jeopardize any attorney-client or
other privilege; or (iii) contravene any applicable Law, fiduciary duty or
binding agreement entered into prior to the Signing Date. Prior to the
Closing, without the prior written consent of Seller, which may be withheld
for any reason, Buyer shall not contact any suppliers to, or customers of, the
Company and Buyer shall have no right to perform invasive or subsurface
investigations of the Real Property.

 



47 Section 6.03. Disclosure Schedules.

 

(a) The Disclosure Schedules delivered pursuant to this Agreement shall be in
writing and shall qualify this Agreement. Descriptions of terms or documents
summarized in the Disclosure Schedules shall be qualified in their entirety by
the documents themselves.

(b) From time to time prior to the Closing, Seller shall have the right (but
not the obligation) to supplement or amend the Disclosure Schedules hereto
with respect to any matter arising after the Signing Date and of which Seller
did not have Knowledge prior to the Signing Date other than in respect of the
Fundamental Representations (each a "Schedule Supplement"). After Buyers
receipt of any Schedule Supplement, Seller shall promptly provide Buyer with
any information reasonably requested by Buyer with respect to the disclosure
in the Schedule Supplement. Within 30 days following Buyers receipt of a
Schedule Supplement where the disclosed matter could reasonably be expected to
result, in Buyers good faith judgment, in a Loss to the Company exceeding
$1.0 million and where Seller has not notified Buyer in connection with such
Schedule Supplement that Seller will pay in full or expressly assume
responsibility for any Losses resulting from such Schedule Supplement (which
period may be extended prior to the expiration of the 30-day period by up to
15 days by written notice by Buyer to Seller if Buyer determines in good faith
that it needs additional time to assess the disclosure in the
Schedule Supplement), Buyer will have the right to terminate this Agreement
in its sole discretion as a result of such Schedule Supplement (whether or not
such Schedule Supplement constitutes or would reasonably be expected to
constitute a Material Adverse Effect or result in a failure of one of the
conditions set forth in Section 8.02). If Buyer does not exercise its
termination right within such 30-day period (as it may be extended), Buyer
shall be deemed to have waived its right to terminate this Agreement pursuant
to Article X before the Outside Date as a result of the Schedule Supplement
and Buyer shall be entitled to seek indemnification in respect of the matters
set forth in the Schedule Supplement in accordance with Section 9.02, but
only to the extent the aggregate of all Losses relating to the Schedule
Supplement exceed $1.0 million in the aggregate (the "Schedule Supplement
Threshold"); _provided_ that any Losses relating to the Schedule Supplement
that exceed the Schedule Supplement Threshold shall remain and be subject to
the limitations on indemnity set forth in Section 9.04(b), (c) and (d) (but
not the first three sentences of Section 9.04(a)). Notwithstanding anything
to the contrary set forth herein the Parties acknowledge and agree that the
dollar amounts referenced in this Section 6.03(b) and the Schedule Supplement
Threshold shall not be deemed to in any manner establish or create any
standard of materiality for the Transaction Documents or any of the
Transactions, including with respect to determining whether any of the
conditions set forth in Section 8.02 has been satisfied.

(c) All Section headings in the Disclosure Schedules correspond to the
Sections of this Agreement, but information provided in any Section of the
Disclosure Schedules shall constitute disclosure for purposes of each Section
of this Agreement to the extent that the relevance or applicability of the
information disclosed to the representation, warranty or covenant is
reasonably apparent on its face.

Section 6.04. Resignations. Seller shall deliver to Buyer written
resignations, effective as of the Closing Date, of the officers and managers
of the Company requested by Buyer at least five (5) Business Days prior to the
Closing.

 



48 Section 6.05. Confidentiality.

 

(a) _Confidential Information_. Each party hereto acknowledges that it has or
may have had in the past, currently has, and in the future may have, access
to Confidential Information of the other parties hereto and their Affiliates.
Each party hereto agrees that it will keep confidential all Confidential
Information of the other party furnished to or otherwise available to it
and, except with the specific prior written consent of the owner of such
Confidential Information, will not disclose such Confidential Information to
any Person. The provisions of this Section 6.05(a) shall not apply to the
disclosure or use of any information, documents or materials (i) which are or
become generally available to the public other than as a result of disclosure
by the receiving party or any Affiliate or Representative of the receiving
party in violation of this Section 6.05(a), (ii) received from a third Person
on a non-confidential basis from a source other than the providing party or
its representatives, which source, to the knowledge of the receiving party, is
not prohibited from disclosing such information to the receiving party by a
legal, contractual or fiduciary obligation to the providing party, (iii)
required by applicable Law to be disclosed by such party ( _provided_ that the
receiving party if permissible under applicable Law shall give reasonable
advance written notice to the disclosing party of any such required disclosure
so that an appropriate protective order may be sought) or (iv) necessary to
establish such partys rights under this Agreement or the other Transaction
Documents. Each party shall be responsible for any breach of this Section
6.05(a) by their respective Representatives.

 

(b) _Injunction_. Because of (i) the difficulty of measuring economic losses
as a result of the breach of the foregoing covenants in this Section 6.05 and
(ii) the immediate and irreparable damage that might be caused to a party for
which it would have no other adequate remedy, in the event of a breach or
threatened breach by another party of the provisions of this Section 6.05
with respect to any Confidential Information, each party will be entitled to
an injunction restraining the other parties from disclosing, in whole or in
part, that Confidential Information. Nothing herein shall be construed as
prohibiting the enjoining party from pursuing any other available remedy for
such breach or threatened breach, including the recovery of damages.

 

Section 6.06. Regulatory Matters and Cooperation.

 

(a) Each of Buyer, Seller and the Company will give any notices to, make any
filings with, and use its commercially reasonable efforts to obtain any
authorizations, consents and approvals of any Governmental Authorities which
are necessary to consummate the Transactions, including any filings required
under the HSR Act in accordance with Section 6.06(c). Buyer, Seller and the
Company shall use all commercially reasonable efforts to comply as promptly as
practicable with any requests made for any additional information in
connection with such filings or actions.

 

(b) Subject to compliance with applicable Law (including antitrust and Gaming
Laws), from the Signing Date until the earlier of the termination of this
Agreement or the Closing, Seller and Buyer shall confer on a reasonable basis
with one or more Representatives of the other party to report on the general
status of ongoing operations of the Company and the Biloxi Property. Seller
will cooperate with Buyer and its Representatives in transitioning

 



49  insurance arrangements of the Company as of the Closing, including
appointing Buyers insurance broker as an "agent of record" at least 90 days
prior to the Closing. Seller, Buyer and their respective Affiliates shall
promptly notify each other in writing of, and will use commercially reasonable
efforts to cure before the Closing Date, any event, transaction or
circumstance, as soon as practical after it becomes known to such party, that
causes or will cause any covenant or agreement of Seller, the Company or of
Buyer under this Agreement to be breached in any material respect or that
renders or will render untrue in any material respect any representation
or warranty of Seller or of Buyer contained in this Agreement. Nothing
contained in Section 6.01 hereof shall prevent Seller from giving such notice,
using such efforts or taking any action to cure or curing any such event,
transaction or circumstance. No notice given pursuant to this Section 6.06
shall have any effect on the representations or warranties, or the covenants
or agreements contained in this Agreement other than this Section 6.06 for
purposes of determining satisfaction of any condition contained herein.

(c) Each of Buyer and Seller will (i) within five Business Days following
satisfaction of the condition set forth in Section 8.01(e), take all actions
necessary to make the filings required of Buyer and Seller or their respective
Affiliates under the HSR Act, (ii) comply at the earliest practicable date
with any request for additional information received by Buyer or Seller or
their respective Affiliates from the Federal Trade Commission or the Antitrust
Division of the Department of Justice pursuant to the HSR Act, and (iii)
reasonably cooperate with each other in connection with the other partys
filing under the HSR Act and in connection with resolving any investigation or
other inquiry concerning the Transactions commenced by either the Federal
Trade Commission or the Antitrust Division of the Department of Justice or
state attorneys general.

Section 6.07. Destruction of Chips. If required pursuant to the Gaming Laws,
Seller shall, at least thirty (30) days prior to the Closing, or such other
period as specifically authorized by the applicable Gaming Authorities, submit
for approval to all applicable Gaming Authorities a plan for the redemption
and destruction of all chips, tokens and plaquemines at the Biloxi Property.
Buyer and Seller agree to cooperate with each other in effectuating the plan
that is approved by the Gaming Authorities.

 

Section 6.08. Employees; Benefit Plans.

 

(a) During the period commencing at the Closing and ending on the date which
is twelve (12) months from the Closing Date, but in no event later than
December 31, 2014 (or if earlier, the date of the employees termination of
employment with the Company or any Company Subsidiary), Buyer will, or will
cause the Company or a Company Subsidiary to, provide each employee who
remains employed by the Company or a Company Subsidiary immediately after the
Closing (each a "Company Continuing Employee") with: (i) base salary or hourly
wages which are no less than the base salary or hourly wages provided by the
Company or a Company Subsidiary immediately prior to the Closing; (ii) target
bonus opportunities (excluding equity-based compensation), if any, which are
no less than the target bonus opportunities (excluding equity-
based compensation) provided by the Company or a Company Subsidiary
immediately prior to the Closing (expressed as a percentage of base salary);
(iii) eligibility for retirement and welfare programs (other than pension or
retiree welfare arrangements) that are not materially less favorable in the
aggregate than those provided by the

 



50  Company or a Company Subsidiary immediately prior to the Closing; and (iv)
severance benefits that are no less favorable than the Company or a Company
Subsidiary practice, plan or policy in effect for such Company Continuing
Employee immediately prior to the Closing. Not later than twenty (20) days
prior to the Closing Date, Buyer will provide written notice to Seller of the
names of the individuals whose employment will be terminated prior to the
Closing such that they will not be Company Continuing Employees (collectively,
the "Non-Continuing Employees"). Prior to the Closing Date, the Company will
terminate the employment of each of the Non-Continuing Employees. Except as
expressly required under Section 6.08(a) and 6.08(f), nothing in this
Agreement or otherwise will require Buyer, the Company, any Company Subsidiary
or any of their respective Affiliates to establish or maintain any particular
compensation or benefit arrangement.

(b) With respect to any employee benefit plan maintained by Buyer or its
subsidiaries in which any Company Continuing Employees will participate
effective as of the Closing (collectively, "Buyer Benefit Plans"), (i) Buyer
will use commercially reasonable efforts to waive or cause to be waived all
limitations with respect to pre-existing condition exclusions, actively-at-
work requirements, and waiting periods for each Buyer Benefit Plan that is a
group health plan, and (ii) Buyer will, or will cause the Company or a
Company Subsidiary to, recognize all service of such participating Company
Continuing Employee with the Company or a Company Subsidiary, as the case may
be, as if such service were with Buyer, for vesting and eligibility purposes
in any Parent Benefit Plan;  _provided, however_ , that such service will not
be recognized to the extent that (x) such recognition would result in a
duplication of benefits, (y) such service was not recognized under a
corresponding Benefit Plan immediately prior to the Closing, or (z) such
recognition would otherwise apply to benefit accrual under any defined benefit
plan.

 

(c) This Section 6.08 will be binding upon and inure solely to the benefit of
each of the parties to this Agreement, and nothing in this Section 6.08,
express or implied, will confer upon any other Person (including any current,
former or future employee or other service provider of Seller, Buyer, the
Company, any Company Subsidiary or any of their respective Affiliates) any
rights or remedies of any nature whatsoever. Nothing contained herein, express
or implied, will be construed to establish, amend, modify or terminate any
compensation or benefit plan, program, policy, Contract, fund or arrangement.
The parties hereto acknowledge and agree that the terms set forth in this
Section 6.08 will not create any right in any employee or any other Person to
any continued employment or service with the Company, any Company Subsidiary,
Buyer or any of their respective Affiliates, or to any compensation or
benefits of any nature or kind whatsoever.

(d) Buyer will, or will cause the Company or a Company Subsidiary to, provide
any required notice under the WARN Act and otherwise comply with the WARN Act
with respect to any "plant closing" or "mass layoff" (as defined in the
WARN Act) or group termination affecting Company Continuing Employees
occurring during the 90-day period from and after the Closing. Buyer will not,
and will not permit the Company or any Company Subsidiary to, take any action
on or after the Closing Date that would cause any termination of employment
of any employees of the Company or any Company Subsidiary occurring prior to
the Closing to constitute a "plant closing," "mass layoff" or group
termination under the WARN Act. Seller

 



51  will notify Buyer of any layoffs or other terminations of any employees of
the Company or any Company Subsidiary that occur during the 90-day period
prior to the Closing.

 

(e) After the Closing Date, the Benefit Plans, and any Buyer Benefit Plans
replacing any Benefit Plans, will have exclusive responsibility for the
provision of health care continuation coverage required under COBRA with
respect to any "qualified beneficiaries" within the meaning of Section 4980B
of the Code who are or were employees of the Company or a Company Subsidiary
and who have or have had a "qualifying event" within the meaning of Section
4980B(f) of the Code under such plans, including such qualified beneficiaries
who previously elected to receive continuation coverage under the Benefit
Plans or who between the Signing Date and the Closing Date elect to receive
continuation coverage.

(f) Buyer will, or will cause the Company to, continue to maintain the
Management and Supervisory Incentive Plan for the remainder of the calendar
year in which the Closing occurs, but in no event later than December 31,
2014, with bonuses to be paid to each of the Companys employees
participating thereunder on a basis consistent with the past practices of the
Company (including making any payments due to be paid thereunder after the
Closing Date based on actual Company performance during the
performance periods that ended prior to the Closing Date, which bonus amounts
are listed on Section 6.08(f) of the Disclosure Schedules).

 

Section 6.09. Governmental Approvals and Other Third-Party Consents.

 

(a) Subject to the terms and conditions set forth herein, Buyer and Seller
shall, and shall cause their respective Affiliates to, use their respective
reasonable best efforts and cooperate with the other parties hereto to use
their respective reasonable best efforts to (i) as promptly as practicable,
take, or cause to be taken, all appropriate action, and do, or cause to be
done, all things reasonably necessary under applicable Law to consummate and
make effective the Transactions as promptly as practicable, (ii) obtain from
any Governmental Authorities any consents, licenses, permits, waivers,
approvals, authorizations or orders required to be obtained by Seller, the
Company, Buyer, or any of their respective Affiliates or any of their
respective Representatives, as applicable, in the case of clauses (i) or (ii),
in connection with the authorization, execution and delivery of this
Agreement and the consummation of the Transactions, and (iii) make all
necessary filings, as applicable, and thereafter make any other required
submissions with respect to this Agreement, as required in order to obtain
all Government Approvals.

(b) The parties hereto and their respective Representatives and Affiliates
shall (i) in reasonable consultation, and in no event later than 20 Business
Days after the Signing Date, file all required initial applications and
documents in connection with obtaining the Governmental Approvals (including
under applicable Gaming Laws), (ii) act diligently to pursue the Governmental
Approvals, and (iii) cooperate with each other in connection with the making
of all filings referenced in the preceding sentence, including providing
copies of material documents other than finding of suitability applications
to the other party and its advisors prior to filing such documents, and if
requested, accepting the reasonable additions, deletions or changes suggested
in connection therewith. Each of Buyer and Seller and any
applicable Affiliate shall use its reasonable best efforts to schedule and
attend any hearings or meetings with Governmental Authorities to obtain the
Governmental Approvals as promptly as reasonably

 



52 _ _ practicable. Seller and its counsel shall have reasonable notice of and
an opportunity to participate in the initial meeting between Buyer and the
Mississippi Gaming Commission following the Signing Date. Seller and its
counsel shall have reasonable notice of and, in Buyers reasonable judgment an
opportunity to participate in, all other meetings and other proceedings
between Buyer and Governmental Authorities regarding the Governmental
Approvals. Buyer and Seller shall have the right to review in advance and, in
each case, to the extent practicable and permitted by applicable Laws relating
to the exchange of information (including the HSR Act and the Gaming
Laws), each party will consult with the other parties hereto regarding all
the information relating to Buyer or Seller, as the case may be, and any of
their respective Affiliates or Representatives that appears in any filing made
with, or written materials submitted to, any third party or any Governmental
Entity in connection with the Transactions; _provided_ that Buyer shall not be
required to provide finding of suitability applications for Sellers review.
Without limiting the foregoing, the parties will notify each other promptly
of the receipt of comments or requests from Governmental Authorities relating
to any Governmental Approvals (other than finding of suitability applications)
and will supply the other parties with copies of all correspondence between
the notifying party or any of its Representatives and Governmental Authorities
with respect to Governmental Approvals (other than finding of suitability
applications). Notwithstanding anything contained above to the contrary, if
and to the extent reasonably necessary to preserve the confidentiality of
sensitive business information or legal privilege, copies of documents shall
only be provided (i) to the other partys outside counsel or (ii) on
a redacted basis. __

(c) Without limiting the generality of Buyers undertaking pursuant to this
Section 6.09, Buyer agrees to use its reasonable efforts to take any and all
steps necessary to avoid or eliminate each and every impediment under any
antitrust, competition or trade regulation Law that may be asserted by any
Governmental Authority or any other party so as to enable the parties hereto
to close the Transactions as promptly as possible, _provided_ that such
efforts will not include proposing, negotiating, committing to and effecting,
by consent decree, hold separate orders, or otherwise, the sale, divestiture
or disposition of any of its assets, properties or businesses or of the
assets, properties or businesses to be acquired by it pursuant to this
Agreement as are required to be divested in order to avoid the entry of, or
to effect the dissolution of, any injunction, temporary restraining order or
other order in any Proceeding, which would otherwise have the effect of
materially delaying or preventing the consummation of the Transactions. In
addition, Buyer shall use its reasonable best efforts to defend through
litigation on the merits any claim asserted in court by any party in order to
avoid entry of, or to have vacated or terminated, any Governmental Order
(whether temporary, preliminary or permanent) that would prevent the
consummation of the Closing.

__(d) Seller and Buyer shall use commercially reasonable efforts to give all
notices to, and obtain all consents from, all third parties that are required
to consummate the Transactions, including in connection with the Financing;
_provided, however,_ that Seller shall not be obligated to pay
any consideration therefor to any third party from whom consent or approval
is requested. __

with access to any books or records (including personnel files) pursuant to
this Section 6.11 where such access would violate any Law.

(b) Buyer shall be bound to consummate the Transactions as required by the
terms hereof without regard to the occurrence or effect of any damage or

policy in respect of such events.

surety bonds (and all collateral, indemnity and other agreements associated
therewith) issued on behalf of the Released Parties for the benefit of the
Company listed on Section 6.19(c) of the Disclosure Schedules (the "Surety
Bonds"). In the case of the failure to do so by the Closing, then, Seller and
Buyer shall continue to cooperate and use their respective commercially
reasonable efforts as described in the preceding sentence, and Buyer
shall (x) indemnify the Released Parties for any and all liabilities arising
from such Guarantees and Surety Bonds and (y) not permit the Company or its
Affiliates to (A) renew or extend the term of, (B) amend or waive any
provision of, (C) increase its obligations under, or (D) transfer to another
third party, any Contract or letter of credit or other liability for which any
Released Party is or would be liable under such Guarantee or Surety Bond. To
the extent that any Released Party has performance obligations under any such
Guarantee or Surety Bond, Buyer shall use its reasonable best efforts to (I)
fully perform or cause to be fully performed such obligations on behalf of
such Released Party or (II) otherwise take such action as reasonably
requested by Seller so as to place such Released Party in the same position as
if Buyer, and not such Released Party, had performed or was performing such
obligations.

 

Section 6.20. No Control. Without limiting the covenants and agreements
contained in Section 6.01, prior to the Closing, (i) Buyer shall not directly
or indirectly control, supervise, direct or interfere with, or attempt to
control, supervise, direct or interfere with, the operation of the Business at
the Biloxi Property and (ii) the operations and affairs of the Biloxi
Property shall be the sole responsibility of the Company and its Affiliates
and shall be under the Companys sole and complete control.

 

Section 6.21. Title Insurance.

 

(a) Prior to the Closing, Seller and the Company shall reasonably cooperate
with Buyer to obtain (i) one or more commitments for title insurance (the
"Title Commitment"), issued by the title company that previously issued title
insurance for the Owned Real Property or another title insurance company
selected by Buyer, for the issuance of the Title Policy and (ii) an ALTA/ACSM
Land Title Survey in a form satisfying the requirements of the Financing (the
"Survey") of the Owned Real Property and the Material Ground Leased Property,
and shall cause a copy of the Title Commitment and Survey to be delivered to
Seller as soon as reasonably practicable after the Signing Date, but in any
case within 90 days after the Signing Date and not less than 30 days prior to
the Closing Date. The Title Commitment shall list as exceptions
all Encumbrances and other exceptions to title affecting title to the Owned
Real Property or the Material Ground Leased Property (collectively, the "Title
Exceptions") and include copies of all instruments creating such
Title Exceptions. Buyer shall bear the cost and expense of the Title
Commitment, Title Policy and Survey, including any cancellation fees resulting
from termination of this Agreement.

 



57 (b) Buyer shall review the Title Commitment and Survey, including copies of
all instruments creating Title Exceptions in the Title Commitments. Within
twenty (20) days after receiving the Title Commitment and Survey, Buyer shall
provide Seller with a written notice of objection to (i) any Title Exception
that is not a Permitted Encumbrance and (ii) any Title Exception disclosed on
the Survey, regardless of whether a Permitted Encumbrance, if such Permitted
Encumbrance would materially detract from the use, operation or financeability
of the Owned Real Property or the Material Ground Leased Property or cause
additional exceptions to be taken with respect to the coverage provided under
the Owner Title Policy or the Lender Title Policy for the Financing (including
the endorsements thereto) (each, a "Title Objection"), and Seller may at its
option and in its sole and absolute discretion elect to attempt to cure,
remove or otherwise satisfy any such Title Objections. Seller shall be
required, as a condition to Buyers obligation to proceed to the Closing, (i)
to remove or have removed from title all Encumbrances other than Permitted
Encumbrances, including any Encumbrances evidencing or securing any
Indebtedness on the Owned Real Property and (ii) to deliver to the title
company issuing the Title Policy such affidavits, certificates, consents or
other evidence of authority as such title company may require as a condition
to the issuance of the Title Policy. If considered reasonably necessary or
desirable by Buyer in connection with the Financing and requested by Buyer in
writing prior to Closing, Seller will (i) use commercially reasonable efforts
to obtain as soon as reasonably practicable (provided that obtaining such
order shall not be required to be completed before Closing, or to satisfy any
of the conditions to Closing set forth in Section 8.02) a final and
nonappealable order of a court of competent jurisdiction vacating the
condominium plat and declarations with respect to that part of the Owned Real
Property currently subject to that certain Declaration of Covenants,
Conditions and Restrictions, as amended, of the Windjammer Condominium, and
vesting fee simple title to such Owned Real Property in the Company or
the Company Subsidiaries and (ii) provide such affidavits, certificates or
indemnities as such title company may require in order to remove as Title
Exceptions under the Title Policy (A) all Permitted Encumbrances identified
with an asterisk ("*") on Section 1.01(a) of the Disclosure Schedules and (B)
any other Mechanics Liens with respect to work performed or materials
supplied prior to the Closing Date, regardless whether such Mechanics Liens
are Permitted Encumbrances.

(c) In the event Seller is unable or unwilling to cure any such Title
Objection at or prior to the Closing, Buyer shall have the right to close
over the Title Objection(s) and, at Buyers option, seek indemnification
against Seller for all Losses related to resolving any Title Objection(s).

 

Section 6.22. Non-Solicitation. During the two years immediately following the
Closing Date, Seller will not, and will cause its Affiliates not to, directly
or indirectly, employ, retain, solicit or entice away any employee, director
or officer of the Company; _provided_ that Seller and its Affiliates may
engage in general solicitations not specifically directed at any such
persons. If any provision contained in this Section 6.22 shall for any reason
be held invalid, illegal or unenforceable in any respect, such invalidity,
illegality or unenforceability shall not affect any other provisions of this
Section, but this Section shall be construed as if such invalid, illegal or
unenforceable provision had never been contained herein. It is the intention
of the parties that if any of the restrictions or covenants contained
herein is held to cover a geographic area or to be for a length of time which
is not permitted by Law, or in any way constructed to be too broad or to any
extent invalid, such provision shall not be construed to be null, void and of
 

 



58  no effect, but to the extent such provision would be valid or enforceable
under Law, a court of competent jurisdiction shall construe and interpret or
reform this Section to provide for a covenant having the maximum enforceable
geographic area, time period and other provisions (not greater than those
contained herein) as shall be valid and enforceable under such Law. Seller
acknowledges that Buyer would be irreparably harmed by any breach of this
Section and that there would be no adequate remedy under Law or in damages to
compensate Buyer for any such breach. Seller agrees that Buyer shall be
entitled to injunctive relief requiring specific performance by Seller of
this Section, and Seller consents to the entry thereof.

Section 6.23. Financing.

 

(a) Buyer will use its reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken,
all actions and to do, or cause to be done, all things necessary to
consummate and obtain the Financing on the terms and conditions described in
the Financing Commitment, including using reasonable best efforts to (i)
maintain in effect the Financing Commitment, (ii) negotiate
definitive agreements with respect to the Financing consistent with the terms
and conditions contained in the Financing Commitment (any such agreements, the
"Definitive Debt Agreements"), (iii) satisfy on a timely basis (or obtain
the waiver of) all conditions within Buyers control in the Financing
Commitments or the Definitive Debt Agreements, as applicable, and comply with
its obligations thereunder, and (iv) upon the satisfaction or waiver of such
conditions, consummate the Financing at or prior to the Closing. Buyer will
have the right from time to time to amend, modify or replace the Financing
Commitment; _provided_ , that Buyer will not, without the prior written
consent of Seller, agree to, or permit, any amendment, modification or
replacement of, or waiver under, the Financing Commitment or the definitive
agreements relating to the Financing Commitment if such amendment,
modification, replacement or waiver would (A) reduce the aggregate amount of
the Financing or (B) impose new or additional conditions or otherwise
adversely expand or amend any of the conditions precedent or contingencies to
the funding on the Closing Date of the Financing as set forth in the
Financing Commitment that, when considered with the other conditions taken as
a whole, would reasonably be expected to prevent, impede or delay the
consummation of the Financing or the Transactions contemplated by this
Agreement or make the funding of the Financing less likely to occur or
adversely impact the ability of the Buyer to enforce its rights against the
other parties to the Financing Commitment or the definitive documents with
respect thereto; _provided, further_ , that notwithstanding the foregoing,
Buyer may amend the Financing Commitment to add lenders, lead arrangers,
bookrunners, syndication agents or similar entities who had not executed
Financing Commitment as of the Signing Date if the addition of such parties,
individually or in the aggregate, would not reasonably be expected to delay or
prevent the consummation of the Financing or the Closing.

 

(b) If, notwithstanding the use of reasonable best efforts by Buyer to satisfy
its obligations under Section 6.23(a), any portion of the Financing is
terminated or expires or otherwise becomes unavailable on the terms and
conditions specified in the Financing Commitment or the Definitive Debt
Agreements, Buyer will promptly notify Seller and will use its
reasonable best efforts to arrange and obtain alternative financing from the
same and/or alternative sources on terms and conditions not less favorable,
taken as a whole, to Buyer (as determined in the reasonable judgment of
Buyer), than those contained in the Financing Commitment ("Alternative
Financing"), upon terms and conditions which would not have any

 



59  of the effects specified in clauses (A) or (B) of Section 6.23(a) as
promptly as reasonably practicable following the occurrence of such event.

 

(c) Buyer will keep Seller informed on a reasonably current basis of the
status of its efforts to arrange the Financing and to satisfy the conditions
thereof, including (i) giving Seller prompt written notice of any material
adverse change with respect to the Financing, including if at any time the
Financing Commitment expires or is terminated for any reason or if any
financing source party to the Financing Commitment notifies Buyer that such
source no longer intends to provide financing to Buyer on the terms set forth
therein, and (ii) upon Sellers reasonable request, advising and updating
Seller, in a reasonable level of detail, with respect to status and proposed
funding date. For purposes of this Agreement, references to "Financing" and
"Definitive Debt Agreements" will include the financing contemplated by the
Financing Commitment as permitted by this Section 6.23 to be amended,
modified or replaced and references to "Financing Commitment" will include
such documents as permitted by this Section 6.23 to be amended, modified
or replaced, in each case from and after such amendment, modification, or
replacement.

(d) Seller will, and will cause the Company and the Company Subsidiaries to,
use reasonable best efforts to provide all cooperation reasonably requested by
Buyer in connection with the arrangement of the Financing, at Buyers sole
cost and expense, including (i) furnishing Buyer and the Financing Sources
with such financial and other pertinent information regarding the Company as
may be reasonably requested by Buyer or its Financing Sources, including an
audited consolidated balance sheet and related statements of income and
cash flows for the three fiscal years of the Company ended at least 90 days
prior to the Closing Date and an unaudited consolidated balance sheet and
related statements of income and cash flows for each fiscal quarter of the
Company ended after the close of its most recent fiscal year and at least 45
days prior to the Closing Date (and updates thereto, as reasonably requested
by such Persons and as is customarily included in information memoranda and
other marketing materials used to syndicate credit facilities for senior
secured indebtedness, the "Required Information"), (ii) participating in a
reasonable number of meetings (including customary one-on-one meetings with
the parties acting as lead arrangers or agents for, and prospective lenders
and purchasers of, the Financing and senior management, representatives or
advisors, with appropriate seniority and expertise, of the Company), attending
presentations and sessions with rating agencies in connection with the
Financing, and assisting with the preparation of materials for rating agency
presentations, prospective lender presentations, bank information memoranda
and similar documents required in connection with the Financing, (iii)
obtaining legal opinions and solvency certificates as reasonably requested by
Buyer as necessary and customary for financings similar to the Debt Financing,
(iv) using reasonable efforts to assist in the preparation of a customary
confidential information memorandum for the Financing, other customary
marketing materials to be used in connection with the syndication by the lead
arranger of the Financing and appropriate and customary materials for rating
agency presentations, (v) consulting with Buyer in connection with the
negotiation of and executing such definitive financing documents and
agreements and such other customary documents (including officers
certificates) as may be reasonably requested by Buyer, (vi) facilitating
the pledging of collateral, (vii) using reasonable efforts to obtain
customary payoff letters and customary instruments of discharge and
termination in full of all Indebtedness and Encumbrances, as are required as a
condition to the Closing and as reasonably requested by Buyer, (viii) using
reasonable best efforts to obtain attorney audit response letters

 



60  reasonably requested by Buyer and customary for financings similar to the
Financing, (ix) providing customary authorization letters to the Financing
Sources (including with respect to the absence of material non-public
information about the Company and the Company Subsidiaries and their
securities in the public-side version of the documents distributed to
prospective lenders), (x) agreeing to enter into such agreements and to use
its commercially reasonable efforts to deliver such officers certificates as
are customary in financings of such type and otherwise grant liens on the
assets of the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries pursuant to such
agreements as may be reasonably requested, and (xi) providing at least ten
Business Days prior to the Closing Date all documentation and other
information about the Company as is required by the Financing Sources with
respect to applicable "know your customer" and anti-money laundering rules
and regulations including the USA PATRIOT Act; _provided, that,_ in each case,
that the Company shall not be required to enter into any agreement, document
or instrument that is not contingent upon the Closing. The foregoing
notwithstanding, (A) no obligation of Seller, the Company or any of the
Companys Subsidiaries or any of their respective Representatives undertaken
or under any certificate, document or instrument executed pursuant to the
foregoing shall be effective until the Closing and (B) none of Seller, the
Company, the Companys Subsidiaries or their respective Representatives shall
be required to pay any commitment or other similar fee or incur any other
cost or expense that is not simultaneously reimbursed by Buyer. Buyer will
indemnify and hold harmless Seller, the Company and the Company Subsidiaries
from and against any and all losses, damages, claims, costs or expenses
actually suffered or incurred by them in connection with the arrangement of
the Financing and any information used in connection therewith. All non-public
or other confidential information provided by or on behalf of any Company and
its Subsidiaries pursuant to this Section 6.23 will be kept confidential in
accordance with Section 6.05, except that Buyer will be permitted to disclose
such information to potential Financing Sources, Governmental Authorities and
rating agencies during syndication of the Financing, subject to the potential
sources of capital, such prospective Financing Sources being informed by Buyer
of the obligations of confidentiality relating to Representatives of Buyer and
agreeing to maintain the confidentiality thereof.

(e) Notwithstanding the foregoing, Buyer acknowledges and agrees that this
Agreement and the Transactions are not contingent on Buyers ability to
obtain Financing (including any alternate financing contemplated by Section
6.23) or any specific amount or terms with respect to such Financing.

 

(f) To the extent required in connection with the Financing, the Company
hereby consents to the use of its logos solely for the purpose of obtaining
the Financing; _provided_ that such logos are used solely in a manner that is
not intended to or reasonably likely to harm or disparage the Company or the
reputation or goodwill of the Company or any of their respective
Intellectual Property rights.

TAX MATTERS

 

Section 7.01. Tax Returns.

 

(a) Seller shall file, or cause to be filed, when due all Tax Returns that are
required to be filed by Seller that are required to be filed by the Company
or any Company Subsidiary prior to or on the Closing Date and shall remit or
cause to be remitted any Taxes due in respect of such Tax Returns. With
respect to any items related to the Business, such Tax Returns shall be
prepared in a manner consistent with past practice (except where such past
practice is not consistent with applicable Law).

(b) Buyer shall file or cause to be filed all Tax Returns that are filed or
required to be filed by the Company or any Company Subsidiary after the
Closing Date (a "Buyer Tax Return") and shall remit or cause to be remitted
any Taxes due in respect of such Buyer Tax Return. To the extent a Buyer Tax
Return relates to a Pre-Closing Tax Period or Straddle Period, then (i) such
Buyer Tax Return (described in this sentence) shall be prepared in a manner
consistent with past practice of the Company or Company Subsidiary, as
applicable (except where such past practice is not consistent with applicable
Law), and (ii) Buyer shall permit Seller to review and comment on each such
Buyer Tax Return (described in this sentence) prior to filing and shall make
such revisions to such Tax Returns as are reasonably requested by Seller.
Seller shall pay to Buyer, within fifteen (15) days before the date on which
Taxes are to be paid, the Pre-Closing Taxes shown as due with respect to a
Buyer Tax Return.

(c) Neither Buyer nor any of its Affiliates shall (or after the Closing, shall
cause or permit the Company to) amend, refile or otherwise modify (or grant
an extension of any statute of limitation with respect to) any Tax Return
relating in whole or in part to the Company with respect to any Pre-Closing
Tax Period or Straddle Period without the prior written consent of Seller,
which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned, or delayed.

(d) For purposes of this Agreement, in the case of any Straddle Period, Taxes
of the Company, any Company Subsidiary and any Seller Affiliate (relating to
the Business) allocable to the portion of such Straddle Period ending on the
Closing Date shall (i) in the case of any Taxes other than Taxes based upon
or related to income, gains or receipts (including sales and use taxes), or
employment or payroll Taxes, be deemed to be the amount of such Tax for the
entire Straddle Period multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is the
number of days in the portion of the Straddle Period ending on the Closing
Date and the denominator of which is the number of days in the entire Straddle
Period, and (ii) in the case of any Tax based upon or related to income, gains
or receipts (including sales and use taxes), or employment or payroll Taxes,
be based on an interim closing of the books on the Closing Date. Any
exemptions, allowances or deductions for a Straddle Period that are calculated
on an annual basis (including depreciation and amortization deductions) shall
be allocated between the portion of the Straddle Period ending on the Closing
Date and the portion of the Straddle Period starting after the Closing Date in
proportion to the number of days in each period.

 



62 Section 7.02. Tax Indemnification Procedures; Contest Provisions.

 

(a) Each party shall promptly notify the other party in writing upon receipt
by such party or any of their respective Affiliates of notice of any pending
or threatened federal, state, local or foreign Tax audits, examinations,
claims or assessments (a "Tax Claim") for which such party is entitled to
seek, or is seeking or intends to seek, indemnification pursuant to Article
IX. The failure of Buyer to give reasonably prompt notice of any Tax Claim
shall not release, waive or otherwise affect Sellers obligations with respect
thereto, unless Seller is adversely prejudiced as a consequence of
such failure.

(b) Notwithstanding Section 9.05:

 

(i) To the extent any Tax Claim or administrative or court proceeding relating
to Taxes relates to a Pre-Closing Tax Period, Seller shall have the right to
control and to represent, at its sole expense, the interests of the Company
and any Company Subsidiary in and with respect to such Tax Claim or
proceeding, and to employ counsel of its own choice for such purpose;
_provided, however_ , that to the extent the resolution of such Tax Claim or
proceeding could have a material impact on the current or future Tax liability
of Buyer, the Company, or any Company Subsidiary, Seller (i) shall keep Buyer
informed of all developments on a timely basis, (ii) shall afford Buyer the
opportunity to participate, at Buyers expense, in the conduct and resolution
of such Tax Claim or proceeding, and (iii) shall not settle or otherwise
resolve such Tax Claim or proceeding without Buyers prior written consent,
which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld.

(ii) In all other cases, Buyer shall control the conduct of any Tax Claim or
proceeding; _provided, however_ , that, to the extent such Tax Claim or
proceeding could give rise to an indemnification obligation of Seller to
Buyer, Buyer (i) shall keep Seller informed of all developments on a timely
basis, (ii) shall afford Seller the opportunity to participate, at Sellers
expense, in the conduct and resolution of such Tax Claim or proceeding, and
(iii) shall not settle or otherwise resolve such Tax Claim or proceeding
without Sellers prior written consent, which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld.

 

Section 7.03. Tax Refunds. Any Tax refund or credit that is received by Buyer
or the Company, and any amount credited against Tax to which Buyer or the
Company become entitled, that relate to any Pre-Closing Tax Period or the
portion of the Straddle Period ending at the end of the Closing Date shall be
for the account of Seller, and Buyer shall pay over to Seller any such refund
or the amount of any such credit within fifteen (15) days after receipt or
entitlement thereto; _provided, however_ , that Buyer shall not be required to
pay over any amount under this Section 7.03 to Seller (i) to the extent such
Tax refund or amount of such credit is attributable to a carryback of a Tax
attribute that arises after the Closing Date, (ii) if such Tax refund or
amount of such credit arises in connection with an increase in Post-
Closing Taxes, or (iii) to the extent such Tax refund or amount of such
credit is included in the Closing Date Working Capital.

 

Section 7.04. Tax Cooperation. Upon reasonable written notice, Seller and
Buyer shall furnish or cause to be furnished to the other party, as promptly
as practicable, such information and assistance, to the extent within the
control of such party, relating to the Company, any

 



63  Company Subsidiary or the Business as is reasonably requested for (i) the
filing of all Tax Returns, (ii) the making of an election related to Taxes,
(iii) the preparation for any audit by any Governmental Authority, (iv) the
prosecution or defense of any claim, suit or proceeding related to any Tax
Return, and (v) the conduct of any audit or other similar proceeding relating
to Taxes involving the Company, any Company Subsidiary or the Business. Such
information and assistance shall include the provision (upon the other partys
request) of records and information reasonably relevant to any matter
described in the previous sentence and making employees available on a
mutually convenient basis to provide additional information and explanation of
any material provided hereunder. Any information provided hereunder shall be
kept confidential by the party receiving the information or documents, except
as may otherwise be necessary in connection with the filing of Tax Returns or
in connection with any administrative or judicial proceedings relating to
Taxes. Buyer shall retain the books and records of the Company for Pre-
Closing Tax Periods delivered to Buyer until the expiration of the statute of
limitations (including any extensions thereof) applicable to such Tax periods.

 

Section 7.05. Transfer Taxes. All transfer, documentary, sales, use, stamp,
registration, value added and other such Taxes and fees (including any
penalties and interest) incurred in connection with this Agreement (including
any real property transfer Tax and any other similar Tax) shall be borne and
paid by Buyer when due. Buyer shall, at its own expense, timely file any Tax
Return or other document with respect to such Taxes or fees (and Seller shall
cooperate with respect thereto as necessary).

with respect thereto released, and Seller shall have provided evidence thereof
reasonably satisfactory to Buyer.

provided all consents required to be provided by Hard Rock under the Hard

the Financing and the marketing materials related thereto).

Attornment Agreements in respect of the Cafe Lease and the Retail Lease and a

reasonably satisfactory to the Financing Sources.

(t) Buyer shall have received new or updated Phase I environmental assessment
reports with respect to the Biloxi Property (and, if such reports recommend
further assessment, Phase II environmental reports), in each case, which do
not indicate environmental conditions (other than those disclosed to Buyer

material liability to Buyer or the Company.

be true and correct in all respects as of the Closing Date with the same
effect as though made at and as of such date (except those representations and
warranties that address matters only as of a specified date, which shall be
true and correct in all respects as of that specified date), except where
the failure of such representations and warranties to be true and correct
would not have a Material Adverse Effect on Buyers ability to consummate the

all agreements, covenants and conditions required by this Agreement to be
performed or complied with by it prior to or on the Closing Date.

are all the resolutions adopted in connection with the Transactions and (ii)
the certificate of incorporation and bylaws of Buyer, in each case with all
amendments to date.

(e) Seller shall have received a certificate of the Secretary or an Assistant
Secretary (or equivalent officer) of Buyer certifying the names and
signatures of the officers of Buyer authorized to sign this Agreement, the
Transaction Documents and the other documents to be delivered hereunder and

ARTICLE IX.

 

INDEMNIFICATION

 

Section 9.01. Survival. Subject to the limitations and other provisions of
this Agreement, the representations and warranties contained herein shall
survive the Closing and shall remain in full force and effect until the date
that is 15 months from the Determination Date. None of the covenants or other
agreements set forth in Sections 6.02, 6.04, 6.06, 6.09, 6.10, 6.12, 6.15 and
6.23 shall survive the Closing. Notwithstanding the foregoing, any claims
asserted in

 



68  good faith with reasonable specificity (to the extent known at such time)
and in writing by notice from the non-breaching party to the breaching party
prior to the expiration date of the applicable survival period shall not
thereafter be barred by the expiration of such survival period and such claims
shall survive until finally resolved.

 

Section 9.02. Indemnification By Seller. Subject to the other terms and
conditions of this Article IX, Seller shall indemnify Buyer and its
Affiliates (including the Company after the Closing) (collectively, the "Buyer
Indemnified Parties") against, and shall hold the Buyer Indemnified Parties
harmless from and against, any and all Losses incurred or sustained by, or
imposed upon, the Buyer Indemnified Parties based upon, arising out of, with
respect to or by reason of:

 

(a) any inaccuracy in or breach of any of the representations or warranties of
Seller contained in this Agreement;

 

(b) any Transaction Expenses or Indebtedness of the Company or any Company
Subsidiary not paid as of the Closing Date;

 

(c) any breach or non-fulfillment of any covenant, agreement or obligation to
be performed by Seller pursuant to this Agreement;

 

(d) any and all (i) Pre-Closing Taxes; (ii) Taxes of any member of an
affiliated, consolidated, combined, or unitary group of which the Company or
any Company Subsidiary (or any predecessor of any of the foregoing) is or was
a member on or prior to the Closing Date, including pursuant to Treasury
Regulation §1.1502-6 or any analogous or similar state, local, or non-U.S.
law or regulation; and (iii) Taxes of any Person (other than the Company or
any Company Subsidiary) imposed on the Company or any Company Subsidiary as a
transferee or successor, by Contract or pursuant to any Law, which Taxes
relate to an event or transaction occurring before the Closing;

(e) any liability of Seller or any of its Affiliates (other than of the
Company and the Company Subsidiaries), including in respect of any claim made
by any former holder of any Equity Securities of Seller; or

(f) any liability of the Buyer Indemnified Parties related to any claim (i)
asserted by or against any officer or director of the Company with respect to
the period in which they held such office prior to the Closing Date that
either would be or is asserted to be indemnifiable by the Company pursuant to
the indemnification provisions of the Organizational Documents of the Company
or (ii) that would be or is asserted to be a covered claim under any of the
Insurance Policies set forth, or required to be set forth, in Item 2 of
Section 4.14 of the Disclosure Schedules with respect to an event occurring
prior to the Closing Date (assuming such Insurance Policies would have
remained in effect after the Closing Date and the Company, the Company
Subsidiaries and the other Persons covered under any of such Insurance
Policies as of the Signing Date would have continued to be covered by such
Insurance Policies after the Closing Date).

 

Section 9.03. Indemnification By Buyer. Subject to the other terms and
conditions of this Article IX and Section 10.03(d), Buyer shall indemnify
Seller against, and shall hold Seller

 



69  harmless from and against, any and all Losses incurred or sustained by, or
imposed upon, Seller based upon, arising out of, with respect to or by reason
of:

 

(a) any inaccuracy in or breach of any of the representations or warranties of
Buyer contained in this Agreement;

 

(b) any breach or non-fulfillment of any covenant, agreement or obligation to
be performed by Buyer pursuant to this Agreement; or

 

(c) (c) except to the extent attributable to a breach of any representations
or warranties in Article IV, any and all Post-Closing Taxes.

Section 9.04. Certain Limitations on Indemnity. The party making a claim under
this Article IX is referred to as the "Indemnified Party", and the party
against whom such claims are asserted under this Article IX is referred to as
the "Indemnifying Party". The indemnification provided for in Section
9.02 and Section 9.03 shall be subject to the following limitations:

(a) The Indemnifying Party shall not be liable to the Indemnified Party for
indemnification under Section 9.02(a) or Section 9.03(a), as the case may be,
until the aggregate amount of all Losses in respect of indemnification under
Section 9.02(a), in the case of the Buyer Indemnified Parties, or Section
9.03(a), in the case of Seller, exceeds $1.0 million (the "Deductible"), in
which event the Indemnifying Party shall only be required to pay or be liable
for Losses in excess of the Deductible. With respect to any claim as to which
the Indemnified Party may be entitled to indemnification under Section 9.02(a)
or Section 9.03(a), as the case may be, the Indemnifying Party shall not be
liable for any individual or series of related Losses which do not exceed
$10,000 (which Losses shall not be counted toward the Deductible). The
aggregate amount of all Losses for which an Indemnifying Party shall be liable
pursuant to Section 9.02(a) or Section 9.03(a) as the case may be, shall not
exceed $30.0 million (the "Cap"). Notwithstanding the foregoing, the
Deductible and Cap shall not apply to indemnification claims made by an
Indemnified Party pursuant to Section 9.02(a) and Section 9.03(a) with
respect to breaches of the representations and warranties in Section 4.01
(Organization and Authority of Seller), Section 4.02 (Organization and
Authority of Company), Section 4.03 (Capitalization), Section 4.04
(Subsidiaries), Section 4.09(a) (Tangible Personal Property), Section 4.11
(Condition of Assets), Section 4.23 (Brokers), or Section 5.01
(Organization and Authority of Buyer) (collectively the "Fundamental
Representations"); _provided_ , _however_ , that with respect to breaches of
such Fundamental Representations, and breaches of covenants and agreements
hereunder, in no event shall the aggregate amount of Losses recovered by an
Indemnified Party pursuant to a breach of such Fundamental Representations,
covenants and agreements hereunder, together with the amount of all other
Losses recovered under Section 9.02(a) or Section 9.03(a), as applicable,
exceed the Purchase Price.

(b) Payments by an Indemnifying Party pursuant to Section 9.02 or Section
9.03 in respect of any Losses shall be limited to the amount of any Losses
that remain after deducting therefrom any insurance proceeds and any
indemnity, contribution or other similar payment

 



70  received by the Indemnified Party (or the Company) in respect of any such
claim, less the out-of-pocket costs incurred in recovering any such amounts.

 

(c) Payments by an Indemnifying Party pursuant to Section 9.02 or Section 9.03
in respect of any Losses shall be reduced by an amount equal to any Tax
benefit that results in an actual reduction in cash Taxes payable of the
Indemnified Party in the Tax period of the Loss, calculated on a with or
without basis, and treating Tax items attributable to the Loss as the last
Tax items claimed for the relevant Tax period. For the avoidance of doubt,
this provision does not provide the Indemnifying Party the right to examine
the Tax Returns of the Indemnified Party.

 

(d) Following the Closing, each Indemnified Party shall take, and cause its
Affiliates to take, all reasonable steps to mitigate any Losses upon becoming
aware of any event or circumstance that would be reasonably expected to, or
does, give rise thereto, including incurring costs, but only to the minimum
extent necessary to remedy the breach that gives rise to such Losses.

 

Section 9.05. Indemnification Procedures.

 

(a) _Third-Party Claims_. If any Indemnified Party receives notice of the
assertion or commencement of any action, suit, claim or other legal
proceeding made or brought by any Person who is not a party to this Agreement
or an Affiliate of a party to this Agreement or a Representative of the
foregoing (a "Third-Party Claim") against such Indemnified Party with respect
to which the Indemnifying Party is obligated to provide indemnification under
this Agreement, the Indemnified Party shall give the Indemnifying Party prompt
written notice thereof. The failure to give such prompt written notice shall
not, however, relieve the Indemnifying Party of its indemnification
obligations, except and only to the extent that the Indemnifying Party
forfeits rights or defenses by reason of such failure. Such notice by the
Indemnified Party shall describe the Third-Party Claim in reasonable detail,
shall include copies of all material written evidence thereof and shall
indicate the estimated amount, if reasonably practicable, of the Loss that has
been or may be sustained by the Indemnified Party. The Indemnifying Party
shall have the right, but not the obligation, to participate in, or by giving
written notice to the Indemnified Party, to assume the defense of any Third-
Party Claim at the Indemnifying Partys expense and by the
Indemnifying Partys own counsel reasonably acceptable to Buyer, and the
Indemnified Party shall cooperate in good faith in such defense. In the event
that the Indemnifying Party assumes the defense of any Third-Party Claim as
provided in the immediately preceding sentence, subject to Section 9.05(b),
it shall have the right to take such action as it deems necessary to avoid,
dispute, defend, appeal or make counterclaims pertaining to any such Third-
Party Claim in the name and on behalf of the Indemnified Party. The
Indemnified Party shall have the right, at its own cost and expense, to
participate in the defense of any Third-Party Claim with counsel selected by
it subject to the Indemnifying Partys right to control the defense thereof.
If the Indemnifying Party elects not to compromise or defend such Third-Party
Claim or fails to promptly notify the Indemnified Party in writing of its
election to defend or fails to take reasonable steps to defend such Third-
Party Claim as provided in this Agreement, the Indemnified Party may, subject
to Section 9.05(b), pay, compromise, defend such Third-Party Claim and seek
indemnification for any and all Losses based upon, arising from or relating to
such Third-Party Claim, including its costs of defense. Seller and

 



71  Buyer shall reasonably cooperate with each other in connection with the
defense of any Third-Party Claim, including making available (subject to the
provisions of Section 6.11) records relating to such Third-Party Claim and
furnishing, without expense (other than reimbursement of actual out-of-pocket
expenses) to the defending party, management employees of the non-defending
party as may be reasonably necessary for the preparation of the defense of
such Third-Party Claim.

(b) _Settlement of Third-Party Claims_. Notwithstanding any other provision
of this Agreement, the Indemnifying Party shall not enter into settlement of
any Third-Party Claim without the prior written consent of the Indemnified
Party (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed), except as
provided in this Section 9.05(b). If a firm offer is made to settle a Third-
Party Claim without leading to or having any post-settlement effect on the
Indemnified Partys business or operations, the creation of a financial or
other obligation on the part of the Indemnified Party and provides, in
customary form, for the unconditional release of each Indemnified Party from
all liabilities and obligations in connection with such Third-Party Claim and
the Indemnifying Party desires to accept and agree to such offer, the
Indemnifying Party shall give written notice to that effect to the Indemnified
Party, which notice shall include all copies of all substantial settlement
papers. If the Indemnified Party fails to consent to such firm offer within
ten (10) days after its receipt of such notice, the Indemnified Party may
continue to contest or defend such Third-Party Claim and in such event, the
maximum liability of the Indemnifying Party as to such Third-Party Claim shall
not exceed the amount of such settlement offer. If the Indemnified Party
fails to consent to such firm offer and also fails to assume defense of such
Third-Party Claim, the Indemnifying Party may settle the Third-Party Claim
upon the terms set forth in such firm offer to settle such Third-Party Claim.
If the Indemnified Party has assumed the defense pursuant to Section 9.05(a),
it shall not agree to any settlement without the written consent of the
Indemnifying Party (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or
delayed).

(c) _Direct Claims_. Any claim by an Indemnified Party on account of a Loss
which does not result from a Third-Party Claim (a "Direct Claim") shall be
asserted by the Indemnified Party giving the Indemnifying Party prompt written
notice thereof. The failure to give such prompt written notice shall not,
however, relieve the Indemnifying Party of its indemnification obligations,
except and only to the extent that the Indemnifying Party forfeits rights or
defenses by reason of such failure. Such notice by the Indemnified Party shall
describe the Direct Claim in reasonable detail, shall include copies of all
material written evidence thereof and shall indicate the estimated amount, if
reasonably practicable, of the Loss that has been or may be sustained by the
Indemnified Party. The Indemnifying Party shall have thirty (30) days after
its receipt of such notice to respond in writing to such Direct Claim. During
such thirty (30)-day period, the Indemnified Party shall allow the
Indemnifying Party and its professional advisors to investigate the matter or
circumstance alleged to give rise to the Direct Claim, and whether and to what
extent any amount is payable in respect of the Direct Claim and the
Indemnified Party shall assist the Indemnifying Partys investigation by
giving such information and assistance (including access to the Companys
premises and personnel and the right to examine and copy any accounts,
documents or records) as the Indemnifying Party or any of its professional
advisors may reasonably request. If the Indemnifying Party does not so
respond within such thirty (30)-day period, the Indemnifying Party shall be
deemed to have rejected such

 



72  claim, in which case the Indemnified Party shall be free to pursue such
remedies as may be available to the Indemnified Party on the terms and subject
to the provisions of this Agreement.

 

Section 9.06. Tax Treatment of Indemnification Payments. All indemnification
payments made under this Agreement shall be treated by the parties as an
adjustment to the Purchase Price for Tax purposes, unless otherwise required
by Law.

Section 9.07. Exclusive Remedy. Subject to Section 12.10, the parties
acknowledge and agree that, from and after the Closing, their sole and
exclusive remedy with respect to any and all claims for any breach of any
representation, warranty, covenant, agreement or obligation set forth herein
or otherwise relating to the subject matter of this Agreement shall be
pursuant to the indemnification provisions set forth in this Article IX. In
furtherance of the foregoing, from and after the Closing, each party hereby
waives, to the fullest extent permitted under Law, any and all rights, claims
and causes of action for any breach of any representation, warranty, covenant,
agreement or obligation set forth herein or otherwise relating to the subject
matter of this Agreement it may have against the other parties hereto and
their Affiliates and each of their respective Representatives arising under or
based upon any Law, except pursuant to the indemnification provisions set
forth in this Article IX. Nothing in this Section 9.07 shall limit any
Persons right to seek and obtain any equitable relief to which any Person
shall be entitled pursuant to Section 12.10 or limit or constitute a
waiver of a partys rights with respect to claims against a Person to the
extent they arise out of or based on claims of actual fraud knowingly
committed by such Person or its Representatives.

 

ARTICLE X.

Section 10.01. Termination. This Agreement may be terminated at any time prior

(i) there has been a material breach, inaccuracy in or failure to perform any
representation, warranty, covenant or agreement made by Seller pursuant to
this Agreement, and such breach, inaccuracy or failure cannot be cured by
Seller by the Outside Date, that would give rise to the failure of any of the

terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 10.01(c)(i); or

(ii) any of the conditions set forth in Section 8.01(a), 8.01(b), 8.01(c) or

covenants, agreements or conditions hereof to be performed or complied with by
it prior to the Closing; or

(iii) the condition set forth in Section 8.01(e) shall not have been fulfilled
within 60 days following the Signing Date, unless such failure shall be due

agreements or conditions hereof to be performed or complied with by it prior
to the Closing; or

 



73 (iv) any of the conditions set forth in Section 8.02 shall not have been
fulfilled by the Outside Date;

conditions specified in Section 8.03, and Buyer is not then entitled
to terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 10.01(b)(i); or

(ii) any of the conditions set forth in Section 8.01(a), 8.01(b), 8.01(c) or
8.01(d) shall not have been fulfilled by the Outside Date, unless such failure
shall be due to the failure of Seller to perform or comply with any of the
covenants, agreements or conditions hereof to be performed or complied with
by it prior to the Closing; or

(iii) the condition set forth in Section 8.01(e) shall not have been
fulfilled within 60 days following the Signing Date, unless such failure shall
be due to the failure of Seller to perform or comply with any of the
covenants, agreements or conditions hereof to be performed or complied with by
it prior to the Closing; or

(iv) any of the conditions set forth in Section 8.03 shall not have been
fulfilled by the Outside Date.

 

Section 10.02. Effect of Termination. In the event of the termination of this
Agreement in accordance with this Article X, this Agreement shall forthwith
become void and there shall be no liability on the part of any party hereto
except:

(a) as set forth in this Article X, Section 1.02, Section 6.05, Section
6.10(c) and Article XII and hereof; and

 

(b) that nothing herein shall relieve any party hereto from liability for any

10.01(c)(iv), then Seller shall be entitled to retain and keep the Deposit.

(d) Sellers entitlement to the Deposit, or a portion thereof, pursuant to
this Section 10.03 shall constitute liquidated damages and, notwithstanding
anything in this Agreement to the contrary, prior to the Closing, will
constitute the exclusive remedy of Seller, Seller Parent, the Company and
their respective members and Affiliates for all Losses of such Persons in
connection with any and all claims for any breach of any representation,
warranty, covenant, agreement or obligation set forth herein or otherwise
relating to the termination of this Agreement. In consideration thereof,
Seller, Seller Parent and the Company hereby waive any and all rights or
additional remedies that may otherwise be available to them, at Law or in
equity, as a result of the failure of the Closing to occur or any breach of
any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement in this Agreement (whether
willfully, intentionally, unintentionally or otherwise) or the failure of the
Transactions to be consummated. Upon Sellers receipt or retention of
the Deposit upon a termination of this Agreement, none of Buyer, Buyer
Parent, or any of their respective Affiliates or any Financing Source, or any
of their respective former, current, or future general or limited partners,
stockholders, managers, members, directors, officers, Affiliates or agents,
will have any further liability or obligation relating to or arising out of
this Agreement, the Financing or the Transactions or in respect of any other
document or theory of Law or equity or in respect of any oral representations
made or alleged to be made in connection herewith or therewith, whether at Law
or equity, in contract, in tort or strict liability, by the enforcement of any
assessment, by any legal or equitable Proceeding, by virtue of any Law or
otherwise. Nothing in this Section 10.03(d) will limit the obligations of a
party to this Agreement by virtue of it being an Affiliate of a Financing
Source.

 

ARTICLE XI.

 

PROPERTY

 

Buyer or its Representatives to the extent it so desires have examined and
inspected the Biloxi Property prior to the execution of this Agreement, and
subject to the provisions of this Article XI and otherwise in this Agreement,
Buyer agrees to accept the Biloxi Property in an "AS IS, WHERE IS" condition
as of the Closing. Buyer agrees that, except as provided in Article IV, Buyer
is not relying upon any representations, statements or warranties (oral or
written, implied or express) of any officer, employee, agent or Representative
of Seller or the Company, or any salesperson or financial advisor involved in
this transaction as to the Biloxi Property, including: (a) any representation,
statements or warranties as to the physical condition of the Biloxi Property;
(b) the fitness and/or suitability of the Biloxi Property for use as
a resort, hotel, casino and/or any other use or purpose; (c) the financial
performance of the Company or its casino; (d) the compliance of the Biloxi
Property with applicable building, zoning, subdivision, environmental, land
use laws, codes, ordinances, rules or regulations or any other

 



75  applicable Laws; (e) the state of repair or environmental or condition of

quality of construction of the Biloxi Property; (h) the income derived or to
be derived from the Company or its casino; or (i) the fact that the Companys
casino may now be located in hurricane zones, earthquake faults or seismic
hazardous zones. Seller makes no representations or warranties as to
merchantability or fitness for any particular purpose and no implied
representations or warranties and disclaims all such representations and
warranties. Without limiting the foregoing, and except as expressly set forth
in Article IV, Seller disclaims any warranty of title or noninfringement and
any warranty arising by industry custom or course of dealing. Without limiting
the generality of the foregoing, Buyer acknowledges that neither Seller
nor any of its Affiliates or their respective Representatives has made any
representation or warranty with respect to any projections, forecasts or
forward-looking statements made by, or made available to, Buyer or any of its
Affiliates or their respective Representatives. Buyer and its Affiliates
acknowledge that, in entering into this Agreement, they have relied solely on
their own investigation of the Biloxi Property and the Company and on the

the limitations and restrictions specified herein. Subject to the second
sentence of this Article XI, Section 9.07 and compliance by Seller and the
Company with their respective representations, warranties, covenants and
agreements set forth herein prior to the Closing, Buyer, for itself and its
successors and assigns, waives any right to assert any claim against Seller or
its Affiliates at law or in equity, relating to any matter described in
clauses (a) through (i) of this Article XI or otherwise disclaimed in this
Article XI, whether latent or patent, disclosed or undisclosed, known or
unknown, in contract or tort, now existing or hereafter arising.

Section 12.03. Headings. The headings in this Agreement are for reference only
and shall not affect the interpretation of this Agreement.

Section 12.04. Severability. If any term or provision of this Agreement is
invalid, illegal or unenforceable in any jurisdiction, such invalidity,
illegality or unenforceability shall not affect any other term or provision of
this Agreement or invalidate or render unenforceable such term or provision in
any other jurisdiction. Upon such determination that any term or other
provision is invalid, illegal or unenforceable, the parties hereto shall
negotiate in good faith to modify this Agreement so as to effect the original
intent of the parties as closely as possible in a mutually acceptable manner
in order that the Transactions be consummated as originally contemplated to
the greatest extent possible.

 

Section 12.05. Entire Agreement. This Agreement and the other Transaction
Documents constitute the sole and entire agreement of the parties to this
Agreement with respect to the subject matter contained herein and therein, and
supersede all prior and contemporaneous representations, warranties,
understandings and agreements, both written and oral, with respect to
such subject matter. In the event of any inconsistency between the statements
in the body of this Agreement and those in the other Transaction Documents,
the Exhibits and Disclosure Schedules (other than an exception expressly set
forth as such in the Disclosure Schedules), the statements in the body of
this Agreement will control.

Section 12.06. Successors and Assigns. This Agreement shall be binding upon
and shall inure to the benefit of the parties hereto and their respective
successors and permitted assigns. Neither party may assign its rights or
obligations hereunder without the prior written consent of the other party.
Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, Buyer may assign any or all
of its rights under this Agreement to its Financing Sources as collateral
security for the Financing or assign its rights and delegate its obligations
to any subsidiary of Buyer. No assignment shall relieve the assigning party
of any of its obligations hereunder.

 

Section 12.07. No Third-party Beneficiaries. Except as provided in Article IX,
this Agreement is for the sole benefit of the parties hereto and their
respective successors and permitted assigns and nothing herein, express or
implied, is intended to or shall confer upon any other Person or entity any
legal or equitable right, benefit or remedy of any nature whatsoever under or
by reason of this Agreement; _provided that_ the Financing Sources shall be
third party beneficiaries of Sections 12.06, 12.07, 12.08, 12.09 and 12.10.

 

Section 12.08. Amendment and Modification; Waiver. This Agreement may only be
amended, modified or supplemented by an agreement in writing signed by each
party hereto. No

 



78  waiver by any party of any of the provisions hereof shall be effective
unless explicitly set forth in writing and signed by the party so waiving. No
waiver by any party shall operate or be construed as a waiver in respect of
any failure, breach or default not expressly identified by such written
waiver, whether of a similar or different character, and whether occurring
before or after that waiver. No failure to exercise, or delay in exercising,
any right, remedy, power or privilege arising from this Agreement shall
operate or be construed as a waiver thereof; nor shall any single or partial
exercise of any right, remedy, power or privilege hereunder preclude any other
or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right, remedy, power
or privilege. No amendment to Sections 12.06, 12.07, 12.08, 12.09 and 12.10
shall be made without the prior written consent of the Financing Sources.

Section 12.09. Governing Law; Submission to Jurisdiction; Waiver of Jury
Trial.

 

(a) This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the
internal laws of the State of New York without giving effect to any choice or
conflict of laws provision or rule (whether of the State of New York or any
other jurisdiction). Each party irrevocably (i) consents to the exclusive
personal jurisdiction of the state and federal courts located in the State
of New York in connection with any controversy related to this Agreement,
(ii) waives any argument that venue in any such forum is not convenient, (iii)
agrees that any litigation initiated by any of them in connection with this
Agreement (including any dispute arising out of or relating in any way to the
Financing) shall be venued in the United States District Court for the
Southern District of New York, (iv) agrees not to bring or permit any of its
affiliates or representatives to bring or support anyone else in bringing any
such action in any other court, and (v) agrees that service of process,
summons, notice or document by registered mail addressed as provided in
Section 12.02 will be effective service of process against it for any such
action brought in any such court, and (vi) agrees that a final judgment in any
such action will be conclusive and may be enforced in other jurisdictions by
suit on the judgment or in any other manner provided by Law.

(b) EACH PARTY ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES THAT ANY CONTROVERSY WHICH MAY ARISE
UNDER THIS AGREEMENT OR THE OTHER TRANSACTION DOCUMENTS (INCLUDING ANY
DISPUTE ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING IN ANY WAY TO THE FINANCING) IS LIKELY TO
INVOLVE COMPLICATED AND DIFFICULT ISSUES AND, THEREFORE, EACH SUCH PARTY
IRREVOCABLY AND UNCONDITIONALLY WAIVES ANY RIGHT IT MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL BY
JURY IN RESPECT OF ANY LEGAL ACTION ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS
AGREEMENT, THE OTHER TRANSACTION DOCUMENTS OR THE TRANSACTIONS. EACH PARTY TO
THIS AGREEMENT CERTIFIES AND ACKNOWLEDGES THAT (I) NO REPRESENTATIVE OF
ANY OTHER PARTY HAS REPRESENTED, EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE, THAT SUCH OTHER
PARTY WOULD NOT SEEK TO ENFORCE THE FOREGOING WAIVER IN THE EVENT OF A LEGAL
ACTION, (II) SUCH PARTY HAS CONSIDERED THE IMPLICATIONS OF THIS WAIVER, (III)
SUCH PARTY MAKES THIS WAIVER VOLUNTARILY, AND (IV) SUCH PARTY HAS BEEN
INDUCED TO ENTER INTO THIS AGREEMENT BY, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE MUTUAL
WAIVERS AND CERTIFICATIONS IN THIS SECTION 12.09(b).

 



79 (c) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, (i) none of Seller and
any of its respective Representatives or Affiliates shall have any rights or
claims against any Financing Source or any of the respective former, current
or future Affiliate or Representatives of the Financing Sources (collectively,
the "Financing Parties") in connection with this Agreement or the Financing,
and no Financing Party shall have any rights or claims against any of Seller
or any of its respective Representatives in connection with this Agreement or
the Financing, in each case whether at law or equity, in contract, in tort or
otherwise; _provided, that,_ following the Closing Date, the foregoing shall
not limit the rights of the Financing Parties under any Financing, and (ii)
without prejudice to clause (i) above, each of the parties hereto hereby
agrees that it will not bring or support any action, cause of action, claim,
cross-claim or third-party claim of any kind or description, whether in law or
in equity, whether in contract or in tort or otherwise, against any Financing
Source in any way relating to this Agreement or any of the Transactions,
including any dispute arising out of or relating in any way to the Financing
or the performance thereof, in any forum other than the Supreme Court of the
State of New York, County of New York, or, if under applicable law
jurisdiction is vested in Federal courts, the United States District Court for
the Southern District of New York (or appellate courts thereof), and that the
provisions of Section 12.09(b) relating to the waiver of jury trial shall
apply to any such action, cause of action, claim, cross-claim or third-party
claim.

 

Section 12.10. Specific Performance. Subject to the provisions of Section
10.03(d) and Section 12.09(c), the parties agree that irreparable damage
would occur if any provision of this Agreement were not performed in
accordance with the terms hereof and that the parties shall be entitled to an
injunction, specific performance and other equitable relieve to prevent
breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and
provisions hereof, in addition to any other remedy to which they are entitled
at law or in equity.

 

Section 12.11. Mutual Drafting. Each party hereto has participated in the
drafting of this Agreement, which each party acknowledges is the result of
good faith negotiations between the parties. In the event any ambiguity or
question of intent arises, this Agreement shall be construed as if drafted
jointly by the parties and no presumption or burden of proof shall arise
favoring or disfavoring any party by virtue of the authorship of any of the
provisions of this Agreement.

 

Section 12.12. Counterparts. This Agreement may be executed in counterparts,
each of which shall be deemed an original, but all of which together shall be
deemed to be one and the same agreement. A signed copy of this Agreement
delivered by facsimile, e-mail or other means of electronic transmission shall
be deemed to have the same legal effect as delivery of an original
signed copy of this Agreement.

ARTICLE XIII.

 

GUARANTY

 

Section 13.01. Seller Parent Guaranty.

 

(a) Seller Parent hereby absolutely and unconditionally guarantees (except for
any conditions contained in this Section 13.01) to Buyer the payment and
performance when due of all obligations, liabilities and indebtedness of any
kind, nature and description of Seller and

 



80  Sellers successors and assigns under this Agreement. Seller Parent hereby
expressly waives any requirement that Buyer exhaust any right or take any
action against Seller. In determining when payment, performance or discharge
of obligation by Seller Parent is due, and the amount thereof, there shall be
taken into account any defenses or limitations to such payment, performance or
discharge, and any rights, remedies, counterclaims, reductions and set-offs
Seller Parent or Seller may have under this Agreement. This is a guaranty of
payment and performance and not merely of collection. Seller Parents
obligations under this Section 13.01 are irrevocable. Seller Parent agrees
that Buyer may at any time and from time to time, without notice to or further
consent of Seller Parent, extend the time of payment of any of the obligations
under this Section 13.01, and may also enter into any agreement with Seller
for the extension, renewal, payment, compromise, discharge or release thereof,
in whole or in part, or for any modification of the terms of this Agreement or
of any agreement between Seller and Buyer without in any way impairing
or affecting Seller Parents obligations under this Agreement. Seller Parent
agrees that the obligations of Seller Parent under this Section 13.01 shall
not be released or discharged, in whole or in part, or otherwise affected
by (a) the failure of Buyer to assert any claim or demand or to enforce any
right or remedy against Seller or any other Person interested in the
Transactions, (b) any change in the time, place or manner of payment of any of
the obligations or any rescission, waiver, compromise, consolidation or other
amendment or modification of any of the terms or provisions of this Agreement
made in accordance with the terms thereof or any other agreement evidencing,
securing or otherwise executed in connection with any of the obligations
under this Section 13.01, (c) the addition, substitution or release of any
entity or other Person interested in the Transactions, (d) any change in the
corporate existence, structure or ownership of Seller Parent or any other
Person interested in the Transactions, (e) any insolvency, bankruptcy,
reorganization or other similar proceeding affecting Seller or any other
Person interested in the Transactions, (f) the existence of any claim, set-
off or other right which Seller Parent may have at any time against the Buyer,
whether in connection with the obligations under this Section 13.01 or
otherwise (other than as specifically set forth in this Section 13.01), or
(g) the adequacy of any other means Buyer may have of obtaining repayment of
any of the obligations under this Section 13.01.

 

(b) To the fullest extent permitted by applicable Law, Seller Parent hereby
expressly waives any and all rights or defenses arising by reason of any
applicable Law which would otherwise require any election of remedies by
Buyer. Seller Parent waives promptness, diligence, notice of the acceptance of
this Section 13.01 and of the obligations under this Section 13.01,
presentment, demand for payment, notice of non-performance, default, dishonor
and protest, notice of any obligations under this Section 13.01 incurred and
all other notices of any kind (except for notices to be provided to Seller,
Seller Parent and its counsel in accordance with this Agreement or applicable
Law), all defenses which may be available by virtue of any valuation, stay,
moratorium law or other similar law now or hereafter in effect, any right to
require the marshalling of assets of Seller Parent or any other Person
interested in the Transactions, and all suretyship defenses generally (other
than defenses to the payment of the obligations that are available to Seller
Parent or Seller under this Agreement). Seller Parent acknowledges that it
will receive substantial direct and indirect benefits from the Transactions
and that the waivers set forth in this Section 13.01 are knowingly made in
contemplation of such benefits. Seller Parent acknowledges and agrees that
all provisions of this Agreement shall apply for all purposes of interpreting
and enforcing the provisions of this Section 13.01.
