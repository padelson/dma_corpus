Stock Purchase Agreement

  



  

This STOCK PURCHASE AGREEMENT (this "Agreement") is made as of June 30, 2016
by and among Thor Industries, Inc., a Delaware corporation ("Buyer"), the
shareholders of Jayco, Corp., an Indiana corporation (the "Company")
identified as "Sellers" on the signature page of this Agreement
(collectively, "Sellers" and each, a "Seller"), solely for the
limited purposes expressly set forth in this Agreement, the Company, and
Wilbur L. Bontrager, solely in the capacity as the Seller Representative (as
defined in Section 5.9(a)). Buyer and Sellers (or any Seller) are sometimes
individually referred to in this Agreement as a "Party" and collectively as
the "Parties." Each capitalized term used in this Agreement and not otherwise
defined has the meaning set forth in Article 9.

  



  

The Company, through its Subsidiaries, is engaged in the business of
manufacturing and selling towable and motorized Class A and Class C
recreational vehicles (the "Business"). Buyer desires to purchase from
Sellers, and Sellers desire to sell to Buyer, all of the issued and
outstanding shares of capital stock of the Company (collectively, the
"Shares") on the terms and subject to the conditions of this Agreement. All
of the Shares are owned, beneficially and of record, by Sellers. This
Agreement is executed by JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., as Trustee, and not
individually. The Trustee shall not be personally liable under this Agreement
and the remedies of any contracting parties, or their assigns, or successors-
in-interest, are limited to the amount of the Trust assets being administered
by the Trustee.

  



  

ACCORDINGLY, in consideration of the representations, warranties, covenants
and agreements contained in this Agreement, the Parties agree as follows:

  



  

 _Article 1_ 
  _Principal Transaction_

  



  

 _Section 1.1_ _Sale and Purchase of Shares_. On the terms and
subject to the conditions of this Agreement, Sellers agree to sell and
transfer to Buyer, and Buyer agrees to purchase from Sellers, all of Sellers'
right, title and interest in and to the Shares at Closing, free and clear of
any Encumbrances (other than transfer restrictions arising under applicable
securities Laws).

  



  

 _Section 1.2_ _Estimated Closing Cash Payment; Payments; Purchase
Price_.

  



  

(a) Subject to adjustment under Section 1.3, in consideration of the
sale and transfer of the Shares to Buyer, at Closing Buyer will pay to
Sellers an aggregate amount equal to: (i) $582,000,000; _plus_ or _minus_ (as
applicable); (ii) the Estimated Closing Date Tangible Net Assets Adjustment;
_plus_ (iii) Estimated Closing Date Cash; _minus_ (iv) Estimated Closing Date
Debt; _minus_ (v) Estimated Closing Date Seller Transaction Expenses; _minus_
(vi) $5,000,000 (the "Seller Representative Holdback Funds"); and _minus_
(vii) $4,500,000 (the "Escrow Funds") (the net amount of clauses (i)-(vii),
the "Estimated Closing Cash Payment").

  



  

(b) At Closing, Buyer will:

  



    

Stock Purchase Agreement

| Page 1 
---|--- 

 



    



  

(i) pay the Estimated Closing Cash Payment to Sellers by wire
transfer of immediately available funds to the accounts designated by
Sellers on the Closing Date;

  



  

(ii) discharge or cause to be discharged the aggregate Estimated
Closing Date Debt pursuant to pay-off letters and payment instructions
which have previously been delivered by Sellers in accordance with Section
5.5;

  



  

(iii) pay or cause to be paid the aggregate Estimated Closing Date
Seller Transaction Expenses included in the calculation of the
Estimated Closing Cash Payment pursuant to the invoices and/or payment
instructions which have previously been delivered by Sellers;

  



  

(iv) deposit the Seller Representative Holdback Funds with the Seller
Representative by wire transfer of immediately available funds to the account
which has been designated by the Seller Representative; and

  



  

(v) deposit the Escrow Funds with the Escrow Agent by wire transfer
of immediately available funds to the account designated by the Escrow Agent,
which such Escrow Funds will be held and disbursed by the Escrow Agent
pursuant to the escrow agreement in the form set forth on Exhibit 1.2(b) (the
"Escrow Agreement").

  



  

(c) The Estimated Closing Cash Payment together with the Seller
Representative Holdback Funds and the Escrow Funds and the Estimated
Closing Date Debt and the Estimated Seller Transaction Expenses will
constitute the "Estimated Purchase Price" and, as adjusted under Section
1.3(d), Section 5.7(f) and Article 8 _,_ the "Purchase Price."

  



  

(d) Sellers will maintain at least $5,000,000 in the Seller
Representative Holdback Funds until the Purchase Price is finally determined
and paid under Section 1.3(d), and the Seller Representative Holdback Funds
shall be used by Seller Representative towards any payment required by
Sellers under Section 1.3(d)(B).

  



  

 _Section 1.3_ _Adjustments to Estimated Purchase Price_.

  



  

(a) The Seller Representative has delivered to Buyer the statement
attached as Exhibit 1.3(a) ("Estimated Closing Statement") setting forth
Sellers' good faith written estimate and consistent with the Accounting
Principles of: (i) Closing Date Tangible Net Assets ("Estimated Closing Date
Tangible Net Assets") and the Estimated Closing Date Tangible Net Assets
Adjustment (for the avoidance doubt the adjustment shall be the difference,
plus or minus, between the Estimated Closing Date Tangible Net Assets and
$125,000,000); (ii) Closing Date Cash ("Estimated Closing Date Cash"); (iii)
Closing Date Debt ("Estimated Closing Date Debt"); (iv) Closing Date Seller
Transaction Expenses ("Estimated Closing Date Seller Transaction Expenses");
and (v) the resulting Estimated Closing Cash Payment derived from those
estimates.

  



  

(b) Within 90 days after the Closing Date, Buyer will cause to be
prepared and delivered to the Seller Representative a statement (the
"Preliminary Closing Statement") setting forth in reasonable detail and
consistent with the Accounting Principles Buyer's good faith written
calculation of: (i) Closing Date Tangible Net Assets and the Closing Date
Tangible Net Assets Adjustment; (ii) Closing Date Cash; (iii) Closing Date
Debt; (iv) Closing Date Seller Transaction Expenses; and (v) the resulting
Closing Cash Payment derived from that calculation. Sellers will have the
opportunity to review the Preliminary Closing Statement for 60 days following
their receipt of the Preliminary Closing Statement (the "Review Period").

  



    

Stock Purchase Agreement

---|--- 

 



    



  

During the Review Period, at the request of the Seller Representative or any
Seller, the Seller Representative or such Seller and their respective
Representatives will, during normal business hours, be provided with such
access to Books and Records of the Company and other information
(including financial statements and work papers (including those prepared by
independent third Persons) subject to customary access policies and
procedures) of the Company and Buyer in the possession or control of the
Company, Buyer or their respective Affiliates or Representatives that relate
to, as well as access to personnel of Buyer, its Affiliates (including the
Company) and their respective Representatives that were involved in, the
calculation or determination of the items included in the Preliminary Closing
Statement (including making available their chief financial officer(s) and
accountants to respond to reasonable written or oral inquiries of the Seller
Representative, any Seller or their respective Representatives), in each
case, as is reasonably necessary in order for the Seller Representative or
Sellers to respond to or evaluate the calculations contained in the
Preliminary Closing Statement.

  



  

Buyer's calculation of Closing Date Tangible Net Assets, the Closing Date
Tangible Net Assets Adjustment, Closing Date Cash, Closing Date Debt,
Closing Date Seller Transaction Expenses, and the Final Closing Cash Payment
derived from that calculation will, absent fraud or manifest error, become
final, conclusive and binding on the Parties unless, prior to the end of the
Review Period, the Seller Representative or any Seller notifies Buyer in
writing of Sellers' objections to such calculation (an "Objection
Notice"), identifying in reasonable detail the disputed items, the estimated
amounts of the disputed items if then reasonably determinable and the basic
facts underlying Sellers' objections. If the Seller Representative or any
Seller delivers an Objection Notice to Buyer prior to the end of the Review
Period, Buyer and the Seller Representative will negotiate in good faith to
resolve Sellers' objections set forth in the Objection Notice within 30 days
following delivery of the Objection Notice. If Buyer and the
Seller Representative resolve some or all of such objections within that time
period, they will document their resolution in a writing signed by each of
them, and such resolution will be final, conclusive and binding on the
Parties. If Buyer and the Seller Representative are unable to resolve all of
Sellers' objections within the 30-day time period following the delivery of
the Objection Notice, the Parties will promptly refer any matters still in
dispute for resolution as provided in Section 1.3(c).

  



  

(c) Any unresolved dispute concerning the Preliminary Closing
Statement under Section 1.3(b) will be referred for resolution to the Chicago
office of KPMG, who will be jointly retained by Buyer and Sellers. If the
Parties are unable to engage KPMG for any reason, then Buyer and the Seller
Representative will each designate a nationally or regionally recognized
independent accounting firm with whom no Party has any current professional
relationship, and the accounting firm to resolve the dispute will be
chosen by lot (KPMG or any other chosen accounting firm is referred to in
this Agreement as the "Accounting Firm"). The Accounting Firm will determine
the allocation of its fees and expenses to the respective Parties based on the
inverse of the percentage that the Accounting Firm's resolution of the
disputed items (before such allocation) bears to the total amount of the
disputed items as originally submitted to the Accounting Firm. (For example,
if the total amount of the disputed items as originally submitted to the
Accounting Firm equal $1,000 and the Accounting Firm awards $600 in favor of
the Seller Representative's position, sixty percent (60%) of the fees and
expenses of the Accounting Firm would be borne by Buyer and forty percent
(40%) of the fees and expenses of the Accounting Firm would be borne by
Sellers).

  



    

Stock Purchase Agreement

| Page 3 
---|--- 

 



    



  

The Accounting Firm will act as a neutral arbitrator and will resolve only
the disputed items that have been referred to it pursuant to this
Section 1.3(c) and solely in accordance with the procedures (including any
relevant defined terms and consistent with the Accounting Principles) set
forth in this Agreement. Any resolution of a disputed item by the Accounting
Firm must be within the range of the differences between Buyer's and the
Seller Representative's positions with respect to such disputed item. The
Parties will provide the Accounting Firm with all Books and Records in their
possession reasonably relevant to the determinations to be made by it as may
be requested by the Accounting Firm. No Party or any Affiliate or
Representative of a Party will meet or discuss any substantive matters with
the Accounting Firm without Buyer and the Seller Representative and their
respective Representatives present or having the opportunity following at
least three Business Days' written notice to be present, either in person or
by telephone. The Accounting Firm will have the power to require a Party to
provide to it such Books and Records and other information it deems
reasonably relevant to the resolution of the dispute, and to require a Party
to answer questions that it deems reasonably relevant to the resolution of
the dispute. All Books and Records and other information (including answers to
questions from the Accounting Firm) submitted to the Accounting Firm must be
concurrently delivered to each other Party.

  



  

All disputes with respect to the application of accounting principles,
including the Accounting Principles or to the mathematical calculation of any
disputed components of the Preliminary Closing Statement that have been
referred to the Accounting Firm pursuant to this Section 1.3 will be resolved
exclusively by the Accounting Firm. The determination of the Accounting Firm
with respect to disputes to be resolved by it under this Agreement, absent
fraud or manifest error, will be final, conclusive and binding upon the
Parties. Closing Date Tangible Net Assets, the Closing Date Tangible Net
Assets Adjustment, Closing Date Cash, Closing Date Debt, Closing Date
Seller Transaction Expenses, and the resulting Final Closing Cash Payment
derived from them, in each case as finally determined in accordance with this
Section 1.3 (whether as a result of a failure to timely deliver an Objection
Notice, mutual resolution of the Parties pursuant to Section 1.3(b),
determination by the Accounting Firm in accordance with this Section
1.3(c), or any combination), will be used for purposes of any adjustments to
the Estimated Purchase Price pursuant to Section 1.3(d).

  



  

(d) Following Closing, the Estimated Purchase Price will be: (i)
increased on a dollar-for-dollar basis by the amount that the Final
Closing Cash Payment is greater than the Estimated Closing Cash Payment; and
(ii) decreased on a dollar-for-dollar basis by the amount that the Estimated
Closing Cash Payment is greater than the Final Closing Cash Payment.

  



  

(A) If the Estimated Purchase Price is increased by the adjustment
provided for in Section 1.3(d)(i), then within five Business Days following
the determination of the Final Closing Cash Payment, Buyer will pay such
increase to Sellers by wire transfer of immediately available funds to the
accounts designated by Sellers.

(B) If the Estimated Purchase Price is decreased by the adjustment
provided for in Section 1.3(d)(ii), then within five Business Days following
the determination of the Final Closing Cash Payment, Sellers' Representative
will cause Sellers to pay such decrease to Buyer by wire transfer of
immediately available funds to the account designated by Buyer.

  



  

(e) For the avoidance of doubt, and notwithstanding anything else
contained in this Agreement to the contrary: (i) for purposes of
calculating the Closing Date Tangible Net Assets, the Estimated Purchase
Price, the Final Closing Cash Payment or the Purchase Price, no
items included in the definitions of Closing Date Tangible Net Assets,
including Closing Date Cash, Closing Date Debt, and Closing Date Seller
Transaction Expenses (or any components of them) will be double counted; and
(ii) for purposes of calculating the Final Closing Cash Payment, any and all
Tax deductions of the Company that are permitted under the Code or other
applicable Law in respect of, or that are attributable to, any of the
following will be treated as occurring prior to the close of business on the
Closing Date: (A) any and all Seller Transaction Expenses (including amounts
that would be Closing Date Seller Transaction Expenses except for the fact
that such expenses were paid prior to Closing); (B) any and all amounts
incurred in connection with the retirement of the Indebtedness of the Company
(including the retirement of Closing Date Debt as contemplated in this
Agreement); (C) any and all employee bonuses or debt prepayment fees
(including the employer portion of any payroll Taxes due in connection
therewith); (D) any and all deductions for unamortized financing costs of the
Company (without duplication of amounts taken into account in clause (ii)(B)
above); and (E) any and all other amounts paid with respect to the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement that are properly deductible in a
Pre-Closing Period.

  



  

(f) On the morning of July 1, 2016, Buyer shall cause the Company
and its Subsidiaries to commence a complete physical identification of their
inventory and count thereof as of the Closing, excluding certain raw materials
that are tracked on a perpetual basis and which were subject to testing on
June 9, 2016. Testing Procedures on July 1 will include the verification of
finished goods and work-in-progress ("WIP") units and chassis, including
inventory maintained at the Company's Idaho facility. In addition, a complete
physical observation shall be performed at the Highland Ridge subsidiary on
July 1, 2016. An acceptable confirmation from the applicable third party will
be obtained for all inventory (raw, chassis, WIP, or finished goods) located
off-site as of the Closing. The Company shall provide the Buyer with a
complete listing of all raw materials tracked on a perpetual basis as of the
Closing by location and the Buyer reserves the right to perform additional
testing of such inventory. The Sellers' Representative and the Buyer, and
each of their respective representatives and accountants, shall be
entitled (i) to have unrestricted access to observe, and make inquiries and
receive responsive information with regard to, the foregoing inventory count,
and (ii) to test and sample such inventory during the course of such inventory
count. Any disagreement between the Parties with respect to the inventory
count, but not the value of such inventory, shall be resolved at the time of
the inventory count, subject to the ability of Sellers to provide an
inventory count listing as of the end of the inventory count procedures on
that date. This inventory count will be utilized by the Parties in the
determination of the Closing Date Tangible Net Assets. Buyer and Sellers
agree to use their best efforts to adjust any inventory count that is, or
appears to be, incorrect based on a review of the inventory compilation
prepared by the Company and its Subsidiaries utilizing the counts from the
inventory count procedures. If Buyer, prior to final determination of the
Closing Date Tangible Net Assets or Final Closing Date Tangible Net
Assets, determines that any inventory count appears mathematically incorrect
as the result of a data entry, recording spreadsheet error or similar
objective mistake, Buyer shall not be bound by the incorrect inventory count
when determining the Closing Date Tangible Net Assets or Final Closing Date
Tangible Net Assets, as applicable, but shall instead use the methodology set
forth on the Accounting Principles on attached Annex 1 to Exhibit 9.1 with
respect to the specific inventory which Buyer has determined was
mathematically incorrect.

 _Section 1.4_ _Purchase Price Allocation_. The sum of: (a) the
Purchase Price; (b) any liabilities of the Company and Subsidiaries required
under GAAP to be reflected on a balance sheet that survive Closing; and (c)
any other applicable amounts required to be included under the Code, will be
allocated among the assets of the Company and Subsidiaries (as such classes
are defined for the purposes of Sections 1060 and 338 of the Code). Such
allocations, and the allocation of any purchase price adjustments, will be
prepared in accordance with the methodology set forth on Exhibit 1.4 and will
be made in accordance with the requirements of Sections 1060 and 338 of the
Code. Within 30 days after the determination of the Purchase Price pursuant
to Section 1.3, Buyer will deliver to the Seller Representative a draft of
such allocation for the Seller Representative's review and approval, which
will be prepared on a basis consistent with the methodology set forth on
Exhibit 1.4. Within 15 days thereafter, the Seller Representative will
deliver to Buyer either a notice accepting the allocation prepared by Buyer or
a statement setting forth in reasonable detail any objections to it and the
basis for such objections. If the Seller Representative timely delivers such a
notice, Buyer and the Seller Representative will use good faith efforts to
resolve such objections. If they are unable to mutually agree on
the allocation, the procedures of Section 5.7(g) will control. No Party or
any Affiliate of any Party (including the Company) will take a position on
any Tax Return, before any Taxing Authority or in any Proceeding that is in
any manner inconsistent with the allocation, as finally determined under this
Section 1.4, without the written consent of the other Parties or
unless specifically required pursuant to a determination by the applicable
Taxing Authority. The Parties will promptly advise each other of the
existence of any Tax audit, controversy or litigation related to any
allocation under this Agreement. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in
this Section 1.4 or elsewhere in this Agreement, the Parties agree to use the
Agreed Warranty Reserve and the Agreed Legal Settlement Reserve for
calculating Closing Date Tangible Net Assets, and Final Closing Date Tangible
Net Assets.

  



  

 _Section 1.5_ _Closing_. The consummation of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement ("Closing") will take place as
follows: (i) exchange of the signed closing deliverables provided for in
Section 1.6 and the payments provided for in Section 1.2(b) will take place on
the date of this Agreement, and (ii) for Tax purposes, and for determining
Closing Date Tangible Net Assets, Closing Date Cash, Closing Date Debts, and
Closing Date Seller Transaction Expenses, the Closing will be deemed effective
as of 11:59 p.m. on June 30, 2016 (the "Closing Date"). The Parties' exchange
of electronic copies of signed documents on the date of this Agreement shall
be followed by exchange of originally signed copies (but the original
certificates evidencing the Shares, and originally executed stock powers
relating to the Shares have been delivered in advance in trust to Buyer's
counsel), or the Parties may mutually agree to meet to exchange signed
documents, at such place or at any other time or date as may be
mutually agreed by Buyer and Sellers.

executed by Buyer and the Escrow Agent; and (ii) all other Transaction
Documents to be executed and delivered by Buyer under this Agreement.

organization. Buyer has all requisite power and authority to carry on its
businesses.

authority to execute and deliver this Agreement and each Transaction Document
to which it is a party and to perform its obligations under this Agreement
and under each Transaction Document. The execution and delivery by Buyer of
this Agreement and each Transaction Document to which it is a party, and the
performance by Buyer of its obligations under this Agreement and under each
Transaction Document, have been duly authorized by all requisite
organizational action. This Agreement has been, and each of the
Transaction Documents to which Buyer is a party will be, duly executed and
delivered by Buyer, as applicable, and constitutes, or will constitute, the
valid and legally binding obligation of Buyer, as applicable, enforceable
against Buyer in accordance with its terms and conditions, except as may be
limited by bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium or other similar
Laws relating to or affecting the rights of creditors generally and except as
such enforceability is subject to the application of general principles of
equity (regardless of whether considered in a proceeding in equity or at
law).

  



  

 _Section 4.3_ _Noncontravention_. Neither the execution and delivery by
Buyer of this Agreement and the Transaction Documents to which Buyer is a
party nor the performance by Buyer of its obligations under this Agreement
or under such Transaction Documents will, with or without the sending of
notice or passage of time (or both): (a) violate any Law or Order to which
Buyer is subject or any provision of their respective charter, bylaws or other
governing documents; or (b) conflict with, result in a breach of, constitute
a default under, result in the acceleration of, create in any party the right
to accelerate, terminate, modify or cancel or require any notice under any
Contract or other arrangement to which Buyer is a party or by which Buyer is
bound or to which any of their assets are subject. Except for any notices,
filings, authorizations, consents or approvals of any Governmental Body
obtained prior to the Closing, Buyer is not required by Law, Contract or
otherwise to give any notice to, make any filing with or obtain any
authorization, consent or approval of any Governmental Body in order to
consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Based on the
capitalization information contained in Schedule 2.2, Buyer has received
communications from the Federal Trade Commission Premerger Notification Office
indicating that no filing is required under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust
Improvements Act of 1976, as amended, and the regulations promulgated under
it, with respect to the transactions provided for in this Agreement.

  



  

 _Section 4.4_ _Proceedings_. There are no Proceedings pending or, to
the knowledge of Buyer, threatened against Buyer that: (a) question the
validity of this Agreement or any action taken or to be taken by Buyer in
connection with, or which seek to enjoin or obtain monetary damages in respect
of, this Agreement; or (b) that, individually and in the aggregate, would
reasonably be expected to adversely affect in any material respect the ability
of Buyer to perform its obligations under and consummate the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement.

for investment and not with a view to any resale or distribution of the
Shares in violation of any applicable securities Laws.

  



  

 _Section 4.6_ _Solvency_. Assuming: (a) that the representations
and warranties of Sellers set forth in Article 2 and Article 3 are true and
correct in all material respects as of Closing; and (b) that the Company and
Subsidiaries will immediately prior to Closing be Solvent, then immediately
following Closing, after giving effect to the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement (including the Financing and the payment of all related fees
and expenses), Buyer and the Company and Subsidiaries will be Solvent. No
transfer of property is being made by (or at the direction of) Buyer, and no
obligation is being incurred by (or at the direction of) Buyer, in connection
with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement with the intent to
hinder, delay or defraud either present or future creditors of the Company
or any of the Subsidiaries.

  



  

 _Section 4.7_ _Inspection_. Buyer is an informed and
sophisticated Person and has engaged expert advisors experienced in the
evaluation and acquisition of companies as contemplated under this
Agreement. Buyer has undertaken such investigation as it deems necessary to
enable Buyer to make an informed and intelligent decision with respect to the
execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement and the other
Transaction Documents. Buyer and its Representatives have been afforded the
opportunity to obtain additional information necessary to verify the accuracy
of the representations and warranties made by Sellers under this Agreement or
to otherwise evaluate the merits of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement and the other Transaction Documents. Buyer acknowledges that: (a)
subject to timing restrictions and access restrictions, Sellers have given
Buyer and its Representatives access to the Books and Records and the tangible
assets of the Company and the Subsidiaries; and (b) there are uncertainties
inherent in making and preparing any financial projection or forecast, written
or oral, relating to the Company or any of the Subsidiaries or the Business
delivered by or on behalf of Sellers, the Company or any of the
Subsidiaries or their respective representatives to Buyer or its
representatives, and that Buyer is familiar with such uncertainties.

  



  

 _Section 4.8_ _Broker 's Fees_. Neither Buyer nor anyone acting on its
behalf has incurred or will incur any liability or obligation to pay fees or
commissions to any broker, finder or agent with respect to the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement or other Transaction Documents for which either
Seller (or if Closing does not occur, either Seller or the Company) will be
liable.

  



  

 _Section 4.9_ _Reliance_. Buyer acknowledges, consents and agrees to
the limitations with respect to the representations and warranties of Sellers
set forth in Section 2.26, including the disclaimer by Sellers of all
representations and warranties other than the Seller Express SPA
Representations. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, Buyer
specifically: (a) disclaims that it is relying upon or has relied upon (and
acknowledges that Sellers have disclaimed) any representations or warranties
of any kind, nature or description, whether express or implied, at Law or in
equity, that may have been made by any Person in connection with or with
respect to the transactions contemplated in this Agreement, the Shares, the
Business, the Company, the Subsidiaries, the Sellers or otherwise or with
respect to any information or documents (financial or otherwise) made
available to Buyer or its Representatives (other than the Seller Express SPA
Representations, but subject to the limitations and disclaimers set forth in
Section 2.26), and acknowledges and agrees that Seller has
specifically disclaimed and does specifically disclaim any such other
representation or warranty; (b) disclaims any obligation or duty by
Sellers, the Company, the Subsidiaries, their respective Affiliates or any
other Person (and acknowledges that Sellers have disclaimed any obligation or
duty of any such Person) to make any disclosures of fact not expressly
required to be disclosed pursuant to the Seller Express SPA Representations;
and (c) release and forever discharge the Sellers with respect to any and all
Liabilities and claims relating to any representation, warranty, obligation
or duty so disclaimed by Sellers.

 _Section 4.10_ _No Knowledge of Misrepresentations or Omissions_.
None of Buyer or any of its Affiliates has: (a) any knowledge that any
representation or warranty of Seller in this Agreement is not true and
correct in all material respects; or (b) any knowledge of any material errors
in, or material omissions from, any Schedule comprising the Disclosure
Schedules.

  



  

 _Section 4.11_ _No Other Representations or Warranties_. Buyer has not
made, nor will be deemed to have made, any representation or warranty in
connection with this Agreement or the transactions contemplated by it other
than as expressly made by it in this Article 4.

  



  

 _Article 5_ 
  _Covenants And Agreements_

  



  

 _Section 5.1_ _Further Assurances_. After Closing, Buyer and
Sellers will take all actions, execute and deliver all further documents and
do all other acts and things as the other may reasonably request to carry out
and document the intent of this Agreement and the other Transaction Documents.

  



  

 _Section 5.2_ _Restrictive Covenants_. In consideration of the
consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and other
valuable consideration:

  



  

(a) The restrictive covenants included in Sections 5.2(b) through
5.2(d) shall run for the following periods: (1) for those Sellers employed by
the Company or a Subsidiary both on and at any time after the Closing Date,
(A) during his/her employment with the Company and/or a Subsidiary and (B)
for a period of two years after his/her termination of employment with the
Company and all of its Subsidiaries or for a period of three years from the
Closing Date, whichever ends later, or (2) for those Sellers not employed by
the Company or a Subsidiary on and at any time after the Closing Date, for a
period of three years from the Closing Date.

  



  

(b) Sellers will, and will cause their respective Affiliates to,
refrain from engaging in any business anywhere in the United States or
Canada in competition with the Business, as conducted by the Company or any
of the Subsidiaries immediately prior to Closing or in any business related
to the manufacture or sale of Class B recreational vehicles and/or truck
campers.

  



  

(c) Sellers will not, and will cause their respective Affiliates not
to, directly or indirectly: (i) hire or induce or assist any other Person to
hire any employee of the Company or any of the Subsidiaries; or (ii) induce or
assist any other Person to induce any employee to leave employment with the
Company or any of the Subsidiaries or any individual employed by the Company
or any Subsidiary within twelve (12) months prior to Closing.

  



    

Stock Purchase Agreement

---|--- 

 



    



  

(d) Sellers will not, and will cause their respective Affiliates not
to, use or disclose to any Person any non-public information of or
relating to the Business or the Company, except to the extent necessary in
connection with any Proceeding subject to Article 8 or if required to do so
by applicable Law or legal process, and except to the extent that such
information enters the public domain through no fault of Sellers in violation
of this Agreement. If a Seller is required by applicable Law or legal process
to disclose any such non-public information, such Seller will: (i) to the
extent permissible under applicable Law, give Buyer prompt written notice of
such requirement so that Buyer may seek, at its sole cost and expense, an
appropriate protective order or other remedy; and (ii) cooperate with Buyer,
at Buyer's sole cost and expense, to obtain such protective order or other
remedy. In the event that such protective order or other remedy is not
obtained, such Seller will furnish only that portion of such non-
public information which, on the advice of his, her or its counsel, is
legally required to be disclosed and, upon Buyer's request and at Buyer's
sole cost and expense, use commercially reasonable efforts to seek
confidential treatment (to the extent available) of such information.

  



  

(e) If a court of competent jurisdiction finds that the time period
of any of the foregoing covenants is too lengthy or the geographic coverage
or scope of any of the covenants is too broad, the restrictive time period
will be deemed to be the longest period permissible under applicable Law and
the geographic coverage and scope will be deemed to comprise the largest
coverage and scope permissible under applicable Law. It is the Parties'
intent to protect and preserve the Business and goodwill of the Company (and
Subsidiaries, and the Business) to be acquired by Buyer, and Sellers agree
that the time period, the geographic coverage and scope of the covenants set
forth in this Section 5.2 are reasonable. If a Seller breaches or threatens to
breach any of the foregoing covenants, Buyer will be entitled to seek
injunctive relief in addition to any other remedies that may be available
under applicable Law.

  



  

(f) Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing in this Agreement will
prevent or restrict a Seller from: (i) owning as a passive investment less
than five percent (5%) of the outstanding shares of the capital stock of a
corporation or the outstanding equity interests of any other entity; (ii)
ownership or other involvement with the entities identified on Schedule 5.2;
or (iii) engaging in any activity consented to in writing by Buyer.

  



  

 _Section 5.3_ _Public Announcements_. The announcement in the
form attached as Exhibit 5.3 will be made immediately after the Closing. In
addition, a Party may, without the prior written consent of the Other Party,
issue or cause publication of any such press release or public announcement to
the extent that such Party reasonably determines, after consultation with
legal counsel, such action to be required by applicable Law or by the
rules of any applicable self-regulatory organization, in which event such
Party will use commercially reasonable efforts to allow the Other Party
reasonable time to comment on such press release or public announcement in
advance of its issuance. Except as provided in this Section 5.3, each Party
will, and will cause its Affiliates and Representatives (including in the case
of Buyer following Closing, the Company and Subsidiaries) to, maintain the
confidentiality of the material terms of this Agreement and will not, and
will cause its Affiliates and Representatives not to, issue or cause the
publication of any press release or other public announcement with respect to
the economic terms of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement without
the prior written consent of the Other Party, which consent will not be
unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned.

 _Section 5.4_ _Employee Benefit Matters_ __.

  



  

(a) From the Closing Date to the first anniversary of the Closing
Date (the "Continuation Period"), in the absence of a material decline in the
Company's performance or a reasonable basis to project such a material
decline, Buyer will provide or cause the Company or Subsidiaries, as the case
may be, to provide the employees of the Company who are employed by the
Company immediately prior to Closing and remain employed by the Company or
Subsidiaries, as the case may be, immediately after Closing (the "Continuing
Employees") base compensation during their period of employment in the
Continuation Period that is no less favorable than the base compensation
provided to such Continuing Employees immediately prior to the Closing
Date and, on an individual merit-based determination, with opportunities for
cash bonuses and other employee benefits (other than any equity-based
compensation) that are substantially similar in the aggregate to those
provided to such Continuing Employees under the applicable Employee Benefit
Plans in effect as of the Closing Date. From and after the Closing Date, Buyer
will, and will cause the Company to, grant Continuing Employees credit for
service with the Company or Subsidiaries, as the case may be, earned prior to
the Closing Date: (a) for eligibility and vesting purposes; and (b) for
purposes of vacation accrual and severance benefit determinations under any
similar benefit or compensation plan, program or Contract that may be
established or maintained by Buyer or the Company or Subsidiaries, as the
case may be, during the Continuation Period to replace an Employee Benefit
Plan (the "New Plans"), but only to the extent that such service was credited
for the same purpose for such Continuing Employee under the
corresponding Employee Benefit Plan as of the Closing Date and would not
result in duplication of benefits. Buyer will: (i) cause to be waived all
pre-existing condition exclusions and actively-at-work requirements and
similar limitations, eligibility waiting periods and evidence of insurability
requirements under any New Plan that is a group health plan to the extent
waived or satisfied by a Continuing Employee under the corresponding Employee
Benefit Plan as of the Closing Date; and (ii) use commercially reasonable
efforts to cause any covered expenses incurred on or before the Closing Date
by any employee (or employee's covered dependent) to be taken into account
for purposes of satisfying applicable deductible, coinsurance and maximum out-
of-pocket provisions under any New Plan in the plan year in which the Closing
Date occurs. Nothing contained in this Agreement, express or implied, is
intended to confer upon any employee of the Company any right to continued
employment for any period.

  



  

(b) The Parties agree that no provision of this Section 5.4 is
intended to, and that no such provision does, confer upon any Person other
than the Parties any right to or remedies under this Agreement, including the
right to enforce any obligations of any Party contained in this Agreement.
Nothing in this Agreement, express or implied, will be construed to prevent a
Party or any of its Affiliates (including the Company and Subsidiaries) from:
(i) terminating, or modifying the terms of employment of, any employees of
the Company or Subsidiaries, as the case may be; or (ii) terminating or
modifying to any extent any Employee Benefit Plan or New Plan or any other
employee benefit plan, program, agreement or arrangement that any Party or any
of its Affiliates (including the Company and Subsidiaries) may establish or
maintain. Nothing in this Agreement will be construed as an amendment to any
Employee Benefit Plan or New Plan or any other compensation or benefit plans
maintained for or provided to directors, officers, employees or independent
contractors of Buyer, Sellers or the Company or Subsidiaries, as the case may
be, prior to or following the Closing Date.

  



    

Stock Purchase Agreement

(c) Certain Supplemental Executive Retirement Plans ("SERP")
administered by Fidelity and certain Executive Supplemental Pension Plans
("ESPP") of the Company will be terminated as soon as reasonably possible
after the Closing. The assets and liabilities associated with these plans are
included in Annex 1 to Exhibit 9.1 for purposes of determining the Tangible
Net Assets as of the Closing Date. The Parties agree that the Buyer, Company
and Subsidiaries will have no Liabilities for claims or expenses relating to
those plans during the period from the Closing through the transfer or
termination of those plans (the "Fiduciary Obligations"), including any
claims that may arise related to the transfer or termination of those plans
regardless of when such claims may be made.

  



  

 _Section 5.5_ _Pay-off Letters_. To the extent deemed necessary
by Buyer and Sellers, Sellers have delivered or caused to be delivered to
Buyer pay-off letters acceptable to Buyer, from each holder of Closing Date
Debt, setting forth the amount necessary to repay the full amount of Closing
Date Debt at Closing and to obtain the release of any Encumbrances on the
assets or properties of the Company securing such Closing Date Debt.

  



  

 _Section 5.6_ _Records Retention_. Buyer and the Company and
Subsidiaries will retain until the seventh anniversary of the Closing Date
any Books and Records of the Company and Subsidiaries relating to pre-Closing
periods to the extent in the possession of the Company and Subsidiaries as of
Closing. After the Closing Date, upon reasonable notice, Buyer and the
Company and Subsidiaries will provide Sellers and their Representatives with
reasonable access (including the right to make copies at their expense)
during normal business hours to such pre-Closing Books and Records of
the Company and Subsidiaries as is reasonably necessary in connection with
any post-Closing matters; _provided_ _that_ any such access does not
unreasonably interfere with the Company's and Subsidiaries' normal business
operations.

  



  

 _Section 5.7_ _Certain Tax Matters_.

  



  

(a) Liability for Taxes. For purposes of this Agreement, the portion
of Taxes attributable to the income, property or operations of the
Company and Subsidiaries for any taxable period that begins on or before the
Closing Date and ends after the Closing Date (a "Straddle Period") will be
apportioned between the portion of the Straddle Period that begins on or
before the Closing Date and ends on and includes the Closing Date (the "Pre-
Closing Straddle Period") and the portion of the Straddle Period that begins
the day after the Closing Date and ends at the end of the Straddle Period (the
"Post-Closing Straddle Period") in accordance with this Section 5.7(a). The
portion of Taxes attributable to a Pre-Closing Straddle Period will: (i) in
the case of any income, sales or use taxes, value-added taxes, employment
taxes, withholding taxes and any other Tax based on or measured by income,
business activity, receipts or profits earned during a Straddle Period, be
deemed to equal the amount that would be payable if the Straddle Period ended
on and included the Closing Date; and (ii) in the case of personal property,
real property, ad valorem and other Taxes of the Company and Subsidiaries
imposed on a periodic basis during a Straddle Period, be deemed to be the
amount of the Taxes for the entire Straddle Period multiplied by a fraction,
the numerator of which is the number of days in the Pre-Closing Straddle
Period and the denominator of which is the number of days in such Straddle
Period. The portion of Taxes attributable to a Post-Closing Straddle Period
will be calculated in a corresponding manner.

(b) Tax Returns.

  



  

(i) Except as provided in Section 5.7(f) with respect to Transfer
Taxes, Sellers will prepare or cause to be prepared and file or cause to be
filed all corporate income Tax Returns of the Company and Subsidiaries with
respect to any Pre-Closing Period (the "Pre-Closing Period Returns") due
after the Closing Date. Upon completion of such Tax Returns for the
Company that pertain to periods prior to the Closing Date, Sellers shall pay
to Buyers any Tax payments due on such returns except to the extent such
Taxes were accrued before Closing or otherwise taken into account in
determining the Purchase Price, and Buyer shall then remit or cause to be
remitted all Taxes in respect of such Tax Returns payable after the Closing
Date. The Sellers shall permit the Buyer to review and comment on each such
Tax Returns described in the preceding sentence for a period of up to ten (10)
days prior to filing and shall make such revisions to such Tax Returns as are
reasonably requested by the Buyer. The Pre-Closing Period Returns prepared
and filed by Sellers will be prepared and filed in a manner that is consistent
with the prior practice of the Company and Subsidiaries (including prior Tax
elections and accounting methods or conventions made or utilized by the
Company and Subsidiaries), except as required by Law. Buyer will prepare or
cause to be prepared and file or cause to be filed Straddle Period Returns of
the Company and Subsidiaries. Buyer will prepare and file the Straddle Period
Returns that it is required to file pursuant to this Section 5.7(b)(i) in a
manner that is consistent with the prior practice of the Company and
Subsidiaries (including prior Tax elections and accounting methods or
conventions made or utilized by the Company and Subsidiaries), except as
required by Law. Buyer will deliver all material Straddle Period Returns that
it is required to file pursuant to this Section 5.7(b)(i) to Sellers for
review and comment at least 20 days prior to the due date (including valid
extensions) for filing such Tax Returns (except where such 20-day period is
not practical, in which case as soon as practical). Within 10 days of
receiving a draft of such Tax Return (except where such 10-day period is not
practical, in which case as soon as practical), Sellers may provide
written comments to Buyer. The Parties will attempt to resolve any dispute
through direct good-faith negotiation subject to the dispute resolution
procedures of Section 5.7(g). In no event will the provision of comments by
Sellers prevent Buyer from timely filing any such Tax Return; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that in the event that the Accounting Firm has not yet resolved
any such Tax Dispute prior to the deadline for filing such Tax Return
(including any extensions), Buyer will be entitled to file such Tax Return
(or amendment) as prepared by Buyer subject to amendment to reflect the
resolution when rendered by the Accounting Firm. Unamortized debt financing
costs, change of control bonus payments and any other amounts payable by or on
behalf of the Company or Subsidiaries in connection with the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement (in each case, if and solely to the extent
that such costs, payments or other amounts are paid prior to the Closing Date
or included in the calculation of Final Closing Date Tangible Net Assets or
included as Closing Date Seller Transaction Expenses for purposes of the
calculation of the Final Closing Cash Payment), to the extent permitted by
applicable Law to be deducted for income Tax purposes on Straddle Period
Returns or Pre-Closing Period Returns, will be reported on such returns as
income Tax deductions of Sellers for the Tax year (or portion thereof) that
ends on or includes the Closing Date and will not be reported on any other
income Tax Return of Buyer or the Company or Subsidiaries, in each case, to
the extent permitted by applicable Law.

  



    

Stock Purchase Agreement

---|--- 

 



    



  

(ii) After Closing, neither Buyer nor Seller will (and will not allow
the Company or Subsidiaries to): (A) file or amend any Pre-Closing
Period Returns; (B) amend any Straddle Period Returns; or (C) or make or
amend any material claim, disclaimer or election in respect of Taxes for any
Pre-Closing Period or Straddle Period, in each case, without the prior written
consent of the other party which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld.

  



  

(c) Tax Refunds and Reductions of Tax. Following Closing, any cash
Tax refunds of the Company or Subsidiaries that are received by the Company
or Subsidiaries, Buyer or their respective Affiliates, and any amounts applied
in lieu of a cash refund against Taxes of the Company or Subsidiaries, Buyer
and/or their respective Affiliates that relate to Pre-Closing Taxes of the
Company or Subsidiaries, will be for the account of Sellers, and Buyer or its
Affiliates (as applicable) will, or will cause the Company or
Subsidiaries to, pay over to Sellers any such refund or the amount of such
application (in each case, other than Pre-Closing Tax Refunds taken into
account in calculating the Final Closing Date Cash Payment) within 15 days
after receipt or application against Tax net of: (i) additional Taxes
incurred by the Company or Subsidiaries or Buyer on account of receipt of such
Tax refunds or application; (ii) any reasonable out-of-pocket costs
associated in obtaining such refunds or applications; and (iii) any Tax
required to be withheld on such payment. If there is a subsequent reduction
by the applicable Taxing Authority of any amounts with respect to which a
payment has been made pursuant to this Section 5.7(c), then Sellers will pay
Buyer an amount equal to such reduction _plus_ any interest or penalties
imposed by the Taxing Authority with respect to such reduction.

  



  

(d) Cooperation. The Parties will, and will cause their respective
Affiliates to, provide each other with such assistance as may reasonably be
requested in connection with the preparation and filing of any Tax Return of
the Company or Subsidiaries or otherwise relating to the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement (including signing any Tax
Return), any audit or other examination by any Taxing Authority, or
any Proceedings relating to liabilities for Taxes of the Company or
Subsidiaries. Such assistance will include making employees available on a
mutually convenient basis to provide additional information or explanation of
material provided under this Agreement and will include providing copies of
relevant Tax Returns and supporting material. The Parties and their respective
Affiliates will retain for the full period of any statute of limitations, and
upon reasonable request will provide the Other Party with, any records
or information which may be relevant to such preparation, audit, examination,
proceeding or determination.

  



  

(e) Audits. If any Taxing Authority issues to the Company or any of
the Subsidiaries, Buyer or any of their respective Affiliates a
written notice of its intent to audit, examine or conduct a Proceeding, a
written notice of its determination of an objection to an assessment solely
with respect to Taxes or Tax Returns of the Company or Subsidiaries for a Pre-
Closing Period or a Straddle Period, or a written notice or inquiry with
respect to any Taxes or the filing of a Tax Return, in each case, for which
Sellers may be liable pursuant to Article 8 (a "Tax Claim"), Buyer will give
prompt notice to Sellers of such Tax Claim following receipt; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that the failure to timely notify Sellers will not relieve Sellers
from liability pursuant to Article 8 except to the extent Sellers are
prejudiced as a consequence of such failure. Sellers will control, at their
sole cost and expense, any Tax Claim with respect to a Pre-Closing Period of
the Company (a "Sellers' Tax Contest"); _provided_ _that_ Buyer, at its sole
cost and expense, will have the right to participate in Sellers' Tax Contest
and _provided_ _further_ _that_ Sellers will provide Buyer with a copy of the
final resolution of Sellers' Tax Contest. Buyer will control any Tax Claim
that is not a Sellers' Tax Contest (a "Buyer's Tax Contest");  _provided_
_that_ Sellers, at Sellers' sole cost and expense, will have the right to
participate in any Buyer's Tax Contest that relates to a Straddle Period. The
Party controlling a Tax Claim described in the preceding two sentences
will not agree to settle such Tax Claim if such settlement would affect the
Tax liability of the Other Party without the prior written consent of such
Other Party, which consent will not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or
delayed; _provided_ _that_  if any Party (the "First Party") reasonably
withholds consent for a settlement, the Other Party (the "Second Party") will
be entitled to enter into such settlement without the consent of the First
Party so long as the Second Party agrees to indemnify the First Party for any
adverse Tax consequences suffered by the First Party as a result of such
settlement.

(f) Transfer Taxes. All transfer, documentary, sales, use, excise,
stamp, registration, filing, recordation, valued-added and other
similar Taxes and fees that may be imposed or assessed as a result of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, together with any interest,
additions or penalties, and any interest in respect of such additions or
penalties, imposed or assessed as a result of the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement ("Transfer Taxes"), will be borne by Sellers, and will be
paid to the appropriate Taxing Authority promptly when due by the Person
having the obligation to pay such Transfer Tax under applicable Law. Any Tax
Returns that must be filed in connection with Transfer Taxes will be prepared
by the Party primarily or customarily responsible under applicable Law for
filing such Tax Returns, and such Party will use its reasonable best efforts
to provide such Tax Returns to the Other Party at least 10 Business Days
prior to the date such Tax Returns are due to be filed. Buyer and
Sellers will cooperate in the timely completion and filing of all such Tax
Returns. Any Transfer Taxes resulting from any subsequent increase in
Purchase Price will be borne one-half by Sellers and one-half by Buyer in
accordance with the provisions of this Section 5.7(f). Any payments made by a
Party to another Party under this Section 5.7(f) will be accounted for as an
adjustment to the Purchase Price to the extent permitted by applicable Law.

  



  

(g) Procedures. Notwithstanding any other provision of this
Agreement, any dispute, controversy or claim arising out of or relating to
this Section 5.7 (a "Tax Dispute") that the Parties using reasonable best
efforts are not able to resolve through direct good-faith negotiation, will
be resolved in accordance with the procedures set forth in this Section
5.7(g). If there has been no resolution of the Tax Dispute after direct
negotiation, then any Party may seek resolution of the Tax Dispute through
binding arbitration administered by tax experts of the Accounting Firm. The
place of the arbitration will be Chicago, Illinois unless otherwise agreed by
Buyer and Sellers' Representative. The Accounting Firm will be instructed to
resolve the Tax Dispute and such resolution will be: (i) set forth in writing
and signed by the Accounting Firm; (ii) delivered to each Party as soon as
practicable after the Tax Dispute is submitted to the Accounting Firm but no
later than the 15th day after the Accounting Firm is instructed to
resolve the Tax Dispute; (iii) made in accordance with this Agreement; and
(iv) final, binding and conclusive on each Party. The Accounting Firm will
determine the allocation of its fees and expenses to the respective Parties
based on the inverse of the percentage that the Accounting Firm's resolution
of the disputed items (before such allocation) bears to the total amount of
the disputed items as originally submitted to the Accounting Firm. (For
example, should the total amount of the disputed items as
originally submitted to the Accounting Firm equal $1,000 and the Accounting
Firm awards $600 in favor of Sellers' position, sixty percent (60%) of the
fees and expenses of the Accounting Firm would be borne by Buyer and forty
percent (40%) of the fees and expenses of the Accounting Firm would be borne
by Sellers). The Accounting Firm will act as a neutral arbitrator and will
exercise its discretion independently to resolve only the disputed items, but
within the range of the differences between the Parties. Each Party
will provide the Accounting Firm with all Books and Records in its possession
relevant to the determinations to be made by it. No Party will (and each
Party will cause it Affiliates and Representatives not to) meet or discuss any
substantive matters with the Accounting Firm without the other Party and its
Representatives present or having the opportunity following at least three
Business Days' written notice to be present, either in person or by
telephone. The Accounting Firm will have the power to require a Party to
provide to it such Books and Records and other information it deems relevant
to the resolution of the Tax Dispute, and to require a Party to answer
questions that it deems relevant to the resolution of the Tax Dispute. All
Books and Records and other information (including answers to questions from
the Accounting Firm) submitted to the Accounting Firm must be concurrently
delivered to the Other Party. All disputes with respect to any Tax Dispute
will be resolved exclusively by the Accounting Firm.

(h) Tax Sharing. All tax sharing agreements or similar Contracts
with respect to or involving the Company or Subsidiaries will be
terminated as of the Closing Date and, after the Closing Date, neither the
Company nor Subsidiaries will be bound by or have any Liability under them.

  



  

(i) Withholding. Buyer and the Company will be entitled to withhold
from any cash consideration payable pursuant to this Agreement such
amounts as Buyer and/or the Company are required to withhold from such
consideration under the Code or any provision of other applicable Tax law. To
the extent that amounts are so withheld, such withheld amounts will be treated
for all purposes of this Agreement as having been delivered and paid to the
Person in respect of which such deduction and withholding was made.

  



  

(j) Section 338(h)(10) Election. Buyer and Sellers agree that under
applicable federal tax laws and, to the extent permitted under applicable
federal and state tax laws, the purchase and sale of the Company Shares
shall, for purposes of all income and similar Taxes, be treated as a sale by
Company of its assets and properties. In pursuance thereof, Buyer and Sellers
shall jointly make the election provided in Section 338(h)(10) of the Code
and applicable Treasury Regulations and, to the extent permitted under
applicable state tax laws, shall also make or be deemed to make such election
or any similar election under and for purposes of state income and similar
Taxes (the "Election"). Sellers have represented in Section 2.10(j) that the
Company is an entity eligible to make the election. Buyer shall prepare, and
Buyer and Sellers shall execute and file Internal Revenue Service Form 8023
and all accompanying schedules and all other forms, elections, and statements
required by any Taxing Authority relating to any Taxes to which Buyer,
Company, or Sellers may be subject that is necessary or appropriate to
effectuate, evidence, and confirm the Election. Such election shall be
executed and filed by the Buyer within 60 days of Closing. Buyer, Sellers, and
Company shall file all federal income Tax Returns, and where applicable,
state income and similar Tax Returns, in a manner consistent with
the foregoing. Within thirty (30) days after the finalization of the Closing
Date Balance Sheet, Buyer shall deliver to Sellers a proposed Form 8883,
based on the valuation of the assets prepared in accordance with Treas. Reg.
Section 1.338-4 and using the methodology on Exhibit 1.4. Sellers shall be
deemed to have accepted the valuation and the allocation unless they deliver
a written notice to Buyer within fifteen (15) days of receipt of the proposed
Form 8883, setting forth the items of disagreement. If Sellers have delivered
a timely notice of disagreement, Sellers and Buyer shall negotiate in good
faith to resolve the items of disagreement. If they have not been resolved
within fifteen (15) days of Buyer's receipt of the notice of disagreement,
the item of disagreement shall be submitted to the Accounting Firm for
resolution (including, if needed, an appraisal of the assets). Buyer shall
pay for the valuation. If there is an objection by the Sellers, and an
appraisal is undertaken, the Parties shall equally pay for the appraisal.

(k) Canadian GST Audit Matters. Sellers will jointly and severally
indemnify and hold harmless the Buyer, Company and Subsidiaries from Adverse
Consequences relating to the Canadian GST Audit. Following the Closing, Seller
Representative will conduct and control, at the Sellers' sole cost and
expense, the negotiation and settlement of the Canadian GST Audit. Buyer
agrees to use, and to cause Company and Subsidiaries to use, reasonable
efforts to assist in the defense of the Canadian GST Audit, including but not
limited to, authorizing John Wolf, Mike Ritchie and any other Company Employee
to work with Sellers' legal and accounting advisors in the defense of the
Canadian GST Audit, including reviewing documents, assembling Company
information, traveling to Canada, or any other efforts necessary to defend
the matter. Sellers will be entitled to enter into a settlement or
settlements of the Canadian Tax Audit Matters on behalf of the Company and
Subsidiaries, but the Sellers shall jointly and severally indemnify the
Buyer, Company and the Subsidiaries from and against any adverse Tax
consequences suffered by the Buyer, Company or any of the Subsidiaries as a
result of such settlement. Buyer shall be entitled to review and comment on
such settlement before it is finalized. Sellers will provide Buyer with a
copy of the final resolution of the Canadian Tax Audit Matters. The cost of
legal and accounting defense representation of the Canadian GST Audit will be
paid by Sellers or reimbursed by Sellers to the Company.

  



  

If as a result of the Canadian GST Audit Jayco, Inc. has the right to invoice
and collect from dealers amounts upon which the Canadian GST Audit was based,
the Company will use reasonable efforts to notify such dealers of their
responsibility, and to assist in collecting the funds from the applicable
dealers. Any and all amounts paid by such dealers to the Company or the Buyer
as a result of this assessment shall either be credited against the liability
assessed against the Company, or remitted to the Sellers, solely at Seller
Representative's election.

  



  

Jayco, Inc. currently maintains a stand-by Letter of Credit in the sum of
C$19,100,000 with JPMorgan Chase relating to the Canadian GST Audit (the
"Letter of Credit"). Sellers will be responsible for all costs of maintaining
the Letter of Credit and all collateral, cash or otherwise, necessary to
sustain the Letter of Credit in effect until the Canadian GST Audit is
resolved, including paying all the bank charges and interest for and relating
to maintaining the Letter of Credit until the resolution of the Canadian GST
Audit. Upon settlement of the Canadian GST Audit (or termination of the
Letter of Credit, if earlier), any remaining collateral provided by Sellers
to sustain the Letter of Credit shall be returned to Sellers' Representative
for the benefit of the Sellers.

Affiliates, successors and assigns from any and all rights, claims, debts,
Liabilities, causes of action, obligations and Adverse Consequences of any

unaccrued, liquidated or unliquidated or due or to become due, whether for

 _Section 5.9_ _Seller Representative_.

  



  

(a) Sellers irrevocably make, constitute and initially appoint
Wilbur L. Bontrager (the "Seller Representative") as their true and lawful
attorney-in-fact with full power of substitution to do on behalf of Sellers
any and all things, including executing any and all documents, which may be
necessary, convenient or appropriate to facilitate the consummation of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the other Transaction
Documents, including: (i) receiving and disbursing payments to be made under

(b) If the Seller Representative is of the opinion that Seller
Representative requires further authorization or advice from Sellers on any
matters concerning this Agreement, the Seller Representative is entitled to
seek such further authorization from Sellers prior to acting on their behalf.
In such event and on any other matter requiring or permitting Sellers to vote
in this Section 5.9, each Seller will have a number of votes equal to the
Shares owned by that Seller immediately prior to Closing and the
authorization of a majority of such Shares will be binding on all Sellers and
will constitute authorization by all Sellers.

  



  

(c) Buyer will be fully protected in dealing with the Seller
Representative with respect to this Agreement, the other Transaction
Documents and the transactions contemplated by it and them and may rely upon
the authority of the Seller Representative to act as the agent of Sellers for
all purposes under this Agreement, the other Transaction Documents and the
transactions contemplated by it and them. Any payment by Buyer to the Seller
Representative under this Agreement or any other Transaction Document will be
considered a payment by Buyer to Sellers. The appointment of the Seller
Representative is coupled with an interest and will be irrevocable by any
Seller in any manner or for any reason. This power of attorney will not be
affected by the disability or incapacity of the principal pursuant to any
applicable Legal Requirement. The Seller Representative will have no
individual liability to Buyer under this Agreement arising from his, her or
its actions as the Seller Representative.

  



  

(d) If at any time there is more than one Person appointed to serve
as the Seller Representative, any act of the Seller Representative will
require the act of a majority of the Seller Representatives which will be
binding upon all the Sellers and the Seller Representatives, and upon such
act by a majority of the Seller Representatives, Buyer will, in reliance on
such act, be entitled to all benefits and protections of Section 5.9(c) as
though such act were the unanimous act of all the Seller Representatives.
Any Seller Representative may resign as the Seller Representative at any time
by written notice delivered to the other Sellers and to Buyer. If at any time
there is no Person acting as the Seller Representative for any reason, Sellers
will promptly designate a new Person to act as the Seller Representative and
notify Buyer in writing of such determination. Following the time that
Buyer is notified that the Seller Representative has resigned and until such
time as a new Person is designated to act as the Seller Representative as
provided in this Agreement and Buyer is so notified in writing, Sellers will
collectively act as the Seller Representative, with decisions made in the
manner specified in Section 5.9(b).

  



  

(e) Seller Representative acknowledges having carefully read and
understands this Section 5.9, accepts such appointment and designation, and
promises to act in the capacity as the Seller Representative in compliance
with and conformance to the provisions of this Section 5.9.

  



  

(f) The Seller Representative will not be liable to any Party for
any error of judgment or any act done or action taken or omitted by
Seller Representative in good faith or for any mistake in fact or Law, or for
anything that Seller Representative may do or refrain from doing in
connection with this Agreement or the other Transaction Documents, except for
Seller Representative's own willful misconduct. The Seller Representative may
seek the advice of legal counsel in the event of any dispute or question as to
the construction of any of the provisions of this Agreement or the other
Transaction Documents or Seller Representative's duties under this Agreement
or the Transaction Documents, and Seller Representative will incur no
liability to Sellers and will be fully protected with respect to any action
taken, omitted or suffered by Seller Representative in good faith in
accordance with the opinion of such counsel.

(g) Any expenses incurred by the Seller Representative in connection
with the performance of Seller Representative's duties under this Agreement
(including any fees and expenses of legal counsel retained by the Seller
Representative) will not be the personal obligations of the Seller
Representative but will be payable and will be promptly paid or reimbursed
first from the Seller Representative Holdback Funds and thereafter by Sellers
on a joint and several basis.

  



  

 _Article 6_ 
  _SIMULTANEOUS SIGNING AND Closing_

  



  

The Parties intend that the transactions provided for in this Agreement shall
close simultaneously with the signing of this Agreement. Upon signing of this
Agreement there are no conditions to either Party's obligations to complete,
conclude, and close the transactions provided for in this Agreement. This
Agreement and the Transaction Documents shall be deemed effective and
delivered as of the Closing.

  



  

 _Article 7_ 
  _EXCLUDED ASSETS ENTITY_

  



  

In preparation for the transactions provided for in this Agreement, the
Company organized and became the sole Member of the Excluded Assets
Entity. Immediately before the Closing, and in the order indicated below, the
Company has (i) transferred the Excluded Real Estate identified on Schedule
2.11(a)(i) and the other assets and liabilities identified on Schedule 7 to
the Excluded Assets Entity, and (ii) amended and restated the Operating
Agreement of the Excluded Assets Entity, and (iii) distributed all of the

 _Article 8_ 
  _Indemnification_

  



  

 _Section 8.1_ _Survival_. The representations, warranties, covenants
and agreements set forth in this Agreement and the right to assert claims
under this Article 8 will survive Closing as follows. The Parties agree that
the right to assert claims against Sellers under this Article 8 for breach of
the representations and warranties set forth in Articles 2, 3 and 4 will
expire on the date that is eighteen (18) months following the Closing Date or
on the applicable statute of limitations, whichever date occurs first, except
that the right to assert claims against Sellers under representations and
warranties set forth in Section 2.2 (Capitalization), Section
3.1 (Authorization), Section 3.3 (Shares) and Section 2.10 (Tax Matters) will
expire on the date that is 90 days following the expiration of the applicable
statutes of limitations. Any covenants or obligations of the Parties
set forth in this Agreement which by their terms are to be performed after
Closing will survive in accordance with their respective terms. An
indemnification claim under Article 8 for breach of a representation or
warranty set forth in Article 2, 3 or 4 or breach of a covenant or agreement
set forth in this Agreement must be asserted in writing by a Party prior to
the expiration of the applicable period for asserting a claim for
indemnification for breach of such representation, warranty, covenant or
agreement as provided in this Section 8.1 and the Parties waive any right
under any statute of limitations to bring any such claim after the expiration
of such applicable survival period; _provided_ _that_ the delivery of
a written notice of any claim which: (i) describes in reasonable detail the
nature of and the underlying factual and legal basis for such claim; (ii)
states the estimated amount of the claim (if then reasonably quantifiable);
(iii) describes in reasonable detail the basis on which such amount was
calculated; and (iv) identifies the provisions of this Agreement upon which
such claim is based, prior to the expiration of the applicable survival
period will extend the survival period of such representation,
warranty, covenant or agreement with respect to such claim through the date

this Article 8, Sellers will, jointly and severally, indemnify Buyer and its
Affiliates and Representatives (the "Buyer Indemnified Parties") from, and
will reimburse the Buyer Indemnified Parties for, all Adverse Consequences to
the extent arising out of or related to: (i) a breach by Sellers of any of
the representations and warranties set forth in Article 2; (ii) a breach by
Sellers of any of their covenants or agreements in this Agreement (other than
the covenants and agreements in Section 5.2 and Section 5.8), but solely to
the extent that such breach (or the facts, event, circumstances or conditions
giving rise to such breach) occur after the Closing; (iii) income Taxes based
on operations of the Company and Subsidiaries before the termination of
Company's and Subsidiaries' S Corporation tax status resulting from the
Closing, and Pre-Closing Taxes not yet due and payable on or before the
Closing Date solely to the extent not included in the calculation of the Final
Closing Cash Payment; (iv) any Adverse Consequences associated with the
Canadian GST Audit referred to in Section 5.7(k) or any Adverse Consequences
relating to any pre-Closing Canadian Goods and Services Tax Liabilities of
the Company or Subsidiaries; (v) Adverse Consequences resulting from any
Liabilities associated with any of the Excluded Assets; or (vi) Fiduciary
Obligations, except to the extent resulting from Buyer's or Company's
intentional misconduct after the Closing.

  



  

(b) After the Closing, subject to the limitations and procedures of
this Article 8: (i) each Seller will severally, but not jointly, indemnify
the Buyer Indemnified Parties from, and will reimburse the Buyer Indemnified
Parties for, all Adverse Consequences to the extent arising out of or related
to a breach by such Seller of any of such Seller's representations and
warranties set forth in Article 3; and (ii) each Seller will severally, but
not jointly, indemnify the Buyer Indemnified Parties from, and will reimburse

 _Section 8.3_ _Indemnification and Reimbursement by Buyer_. After the
Closing, subject to the limitations and procedures of this Article 8, Buyer
will indemnify Sellers and their respective Affiliates and
Representatives (the "Seller Indemnified Parties") from, and will reimburse
the Seller Indemnified Parties for, all Adverse Consequences to the extent
arising out of or related to: (i) a breach by Buyer of any of the
representations and warranties set forth in Article 4; or (ii) a breach by
Buyer (or, with respect to covenants and agreements required to be
performed after Closing, the Company and Subsidiaries) of any of their
respective covenants or agreements in this Agreement, but solely to the
extent that such breach (or the facts, event, circumstances or conditions
giving rise to such breach) occur after the Closing, or (iii) amounts
relating to Transaction Compensation Agreements that were accrued and credited
against Tangible Net Assets in determining the Purchase Price, but which
after the Closing did not become obligations payable by the Company or any
Subsidiary.

  



  

 _Section 8.4_ _Certain Limitations_.

  



  

(a) Basket. Sellers will have no liability under Section 8.2(a)(i) or
Section 8.2(b)(i) with respect to breaches of the representations and
warranties set forth in Article 2 and/or Article 3 until the aggregate
amount of all Adverse Consequences incurred or suffered by the Buyer
Indemnified Parties arising out of or related to breaches of
the representations and warranties set forth in Article 2 and Article 3 taken
as a whole exceed $1,500,000 (the "Basket"), and then only for sixty percent
(60%) of each dollar of Adverse Consequences in excess of the Basket until
the Cap is reached; provided, however, that with respect to claims based on
Actual Fraud by Sellers and/or claims for breaches of Section 2.2
(Capitalization), Section 3.1 (Authorization) or Section 3.3 (Shares), the
Basket shall not apply, and Buyer may recover 100% of each dollar of Adverse
Consequences in excess of the Basket and until the retention amount of
$9,000,000 under the RandW Insurance Policy is reached.

  



  

(b) Cap. Sellers' aggregate maximum liability under Section 8.2(a)(i)
and Section 8.2(b)(i) with respect to breaches of the representations and
warranties set forth in Article 2 and Article 3 will not exceed $4,500,000
(the "Cap"); provided, however, that the Cap will not apply to (i) claims for
breaches of Section 2.2 (Capitalization), Section 3.1 (Authorization) or
Section 3.3 (Shares) or (ii) claims based on Actual Fraud by Sellers.

  



  

(c) Additional Limitations.

  



  

(i) No Person will be entitled to be indemnified for an amount
pertaining to: any Adverse Consequence to the extent that such amount
pertaining to such Adverse Consequence was included in the calculation of
Final Closing Date Tangible Net Assets or included as Closing Date Debt or
Closing Date Seller Transaction Expenses for purposes of the calculation of
the Final Closing Cash Payment. The Buyer Indemnified Parties will not be
entitled to indemnification under this Article 8 for the amount of any Adverse
Consequences caused or aggravated by acts or omissions of any Buyer
Indemnified Party following the Closing Date that are negligent, willfully
intended to cause liability, or in violation of this Agreement or applicable
Law. The amount of any Adverse Consequences that any Indemnified Party will
be entitled to recover will be determined without duplication of recovery by
reason of the state of facts giving rise to such Adverse Consequences
constituting a breach of more than one representation, warranty or covenant.

  



    

Stock Purchase Agreement

---|--- 

 



    



  

(ii) No Party will be obligated to indemnify a Person with respect to
any claim that relates to Adverse Consequences resulting from the passing of
or change in any Law or any accounting policy, principle or practice (or in
their interpretation by any Person) after the Closing Date or any increase in
Tax rates in effect on the Closing Date, even if the change or increase has
retroactive effect or requires action at a future date. The Buyer Indemnified
Parties will not be entitled to indemnification for any Adverse
Consequences resulting from a Buyer Indemnified Party filing a Tax Return
taking a position for Tax purposes that is inconsistent with a position taken
on or with respect to a Tax Return of Sellers or Company or any Subsidiary
that was required to be filed on or before Closing, including the position
that no Tax Return was required to be filed, unless the position taken on or
with respect to such Tax Return required to be filed on or before Closing did
not comply with applicable Law at the time such Tax Return was required to be
filed.

  



  

(iii) No Party will be required to indemnify any Buyer Indemnified
Party or Seller Indemnified Party (as applicable) with respect to a breach of
a representation or warranty if the facts, circumstances or events
constituting the breach were known by any Buyer Indemnified Party or Seller
Indemnified Party and fully appreciated by such Party such that the basis for
a legal claim was understood, as the case may be, prior to the execution of
this Agreement. For avoidance of doubt, no Indemnified Party will have the
right to make a claim for any Adverse Consequences that are primarily
possible or potential Adverse Consequences that such Indemnified
Party believes may be paid or incurred, but only Adverse Consequences that
have, in fact, been paid or incurred by such Indemnified Party.

  



  

(iv) Each of the Parties will use its commercially reasonable efforts
to mitigate any Adverse Consequences for which it seeks to be
indemnified pursuant to this Article 8 upon becoming aware of any fact, event
or circumstance that has resulted in, or would reasonably be expected to give
rise to, any Adverse Consequence; _provided_ that any reasonable fees, costs
and expenses incurred as a result of such efforts to mitigate will be deemed
to be Adverse Consequences for purposes of this Article 8.

  



  

(v) The amount of any Adverse Consequence that any Indemnified Party
will be entitled to recover will be calculated net of any Tax
Benefits expected to be realized by such Indemnified Party in any taxable
period and taking into account the present value of any Tax detriment of such
Indemnified Party. Notwithstanding the foregoing or anything else contained in
this Agreement to the contrary: (A) the amount of any indemnifiable Adverse
Consequences entitled to be recovered by the Buyer Indemnified Parties under
this Agreement for Adverse Consequences with respect to Taxes will be limited
to Pre-Closing Taxes; and (B) the Buyer Indemnified Parties will not be
entitled to indemnification for (and the calculation of the amount of any
Adverse Consequences will not include) any reduction or use of any Tax
attributed to Company or any of the Subsidiaries in a Pre-Closing Period or
Pre-Closing Straddle Period.

  



    

Stock Purchase Agreement

(vi) The amount of any Adverse Consequences that any Indemnified Party
will be entitled to recover will be calculated net of any insurance proceeds
or any indemnity, contribution or other payment actually recovered by the
Indemnified Party from any third party with respect to such Adverse
Consequences, in each case net of all costs of recovery (including any
increased insurance premiums directly attributable to any such insurance
recovery). In the event that any insurance proceeds or other indemnity,
contribution or other payment is recovered by any Indemnified Party with
respect to any Adverse Consequences for which such Indemnified Party has
previously been indemnified pursuant to this Article 8, then the Indemnified
Party will promptly refund to the Indemnifying Party an amount equal to the
lesser of: (A) the aggregate amount of such insurance proceeds or other
indemnity, contribution or other payment (net of all costs of recovery,
including any increased insurance premiums directly attributable to any such
insurance recovery); and (B) the aggregate amount previously paid to the
Indemnified Party by the Indemnifying Party pursuant to this Article 8 in
respect of such Adverse Consequence.

  



  

(vii) Any attorney, consultant or other professional fees, costs or
expenses incurred by an Indemnified Party in connection with this Article
8 (including those incurred in connection with actions to mitigate the amount
of any Adverse Consequences or to recover any insurance proceeds or third
party payments) will only constitute Adverse Consequences indemnifiable under
this Agreement to the extent that such fees, costs or expenses are: (A)
reasonable under the circumstances; (B) based solely on time actually spent by
such professionals; and (C) charged at no more than such professional's
standard hourly rate.

  



  

(viii) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this
Agreement or any other Transaction Document, none of the Sellers will be
required to indemnify a Buyer Indemnified Party for any Adverse Consequences
(including any Environmental Liability) relating to environmental matters
that are caused by or arise from actions voluntarily taken ( _i.e._ , not
required by applicable Law) by a Buyer Indemnified Party other than as
provided in the following sentence following Closing or for any Adverse
Consequences (including any Environmental Liability) caused by, arising from
or relating to any Environmental Matters disclosed on Schedule 2.18. In order
for any Buyer Indemnified Party to maintain its right to indemnification by
any Seller with respect to environmental matters as provided in this
Agreement, following Closing Buyer will not, and will cause its Affiliates
(including the Company and Subsidiaries) not to, cause or permit any
Environmental Action to be performed other than in connection with an actual
capital improvement or asset repair project or companywide ( _i.e._ ; all of
Buyer's operating subsidiaries) voluntary compliance audit in the
ordinary course of business undertaken in good faith and not for the purpose
of evading this subsection _(viii)_ unless: (A) Seller Representative gives
prior written consent to the performance of the Environmental Action; (B)
Buyer or an Affiliate is required to perform the Environmental Action by a
final order of a Governmental Body with appropriate jurisdiction over such
matters; (C) the Environmental Action is routine testing that is required by
the terms of any environmental permit held by Company or any
Subsidiary immediately prior to Closing and necessary for the continued
operation of Business as conducted immediately prior to Closing; or (D) a
bona fide third party purchaser requests that Buyer perform, or allow that
third party to perform, an Environmental Action in connection with the sale
of the underlying property to that third party. Adverse Consequences arising
with respect to environmental matters will be limited to investigatory,
corrective or remedial actions that are required under Environmental Law and
that are conducted in the most cost-effective manner, assuming continued
industrial use of the subject property and employing risk-based standards and
institutional controls. Notwithstanding any provision to the contrary in this
Section or in this Agreement, Buyer Indemnified Party shall maintain its
right to indemnification by any of the Sellers with respect to environmental
matters as provided in this Agreement in the event that a voluntary audit of
environmental compliance identifies any compliance issues that rise to the
level of violating any applicable law, statute, or regulation provided,
however, that a voluntary audit does not include any subsurface sampling of
soil, groundwater or air, unless required under Environmental Law or any
Governmental Authority required by Environmental Law.

 _Section 8.5_ _Indemnification Procedures_.

  



  

(a) Third-Party Proceedings.

  



  

(i) Promptly after receipt by a Person entitled to be indemnified
under this Article 8 (an "Indemnified Party") of notice of the commencement
of a Proceeding by a third party (including a Governmental Body) against such
Person (a "Third-Party Proceeding"), such Indemnified Party will, if a claim
for indemnification is to be made against a Party (an "Indemnifying Party")
under this Article 8, give prompt written notice to the Indemnifying Party of
the commencement of such Third-Party Proceeding for which indemnification is
sought: (A) describing in reasonable detail the nature of and the
underlying factual and legal basis for the claim; (B) stating the estimated
amount of the claim (if then quantifiable) and describing in
reasonable detail the basis on which such amount was calculated; and (C)
identifying the provisions of this Agreement upon which indemnification for
the claim is based. The failure to timely notify the Indemnifying Party or
provide the information described above will not relieve the Indemnifying
Party of any liability that the Indemnifying Party may have to an Indemnified
Party except to the extent that the defense of such Third-Party Proceeding
was actually prejudiced by the Indemnified Party's failure to provide
timely notice or such information.

  



  

(ii) The Indemnifying Party will be entitled to participate in any
Third-Party Proceeding with respect to which indemnification has been or will
be sought under this Agreement and, to the extent that the Indemnifying Party
wishes, to assume the defense of such Third-Party Proceeding (with counsel of
its choice that is reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnified Party) by
notifying the Indemnified Party of its election to do so within 30 days of
receipt of notice of such Proceeding pursuant to Section 8.5(a)(i).
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Indemnifying Party will not be permitted
to assume the defense of a Third-Party Proceeding if: (A) such Third-
Party Proceeding arises in connection with any criminal proceeding, action,
indictment, criminal allegation or criminal investigation of the Indemnified
Party or its Affiliates; (B) the Indemnified Party is advised in writing by
outside counsel chosen by it that there are one or more legal or equitable
defenses available to the Indemnified Party that the Indemnifying Party cannot
assert on behalf of the Indemnified Party (assuming the full cooperation of
the Indemnified Party in asserting such defenses); or (C) it is reasonably
likely that the Adverse Consequences arising or resulting from such Third-
Party Proceeding will exceed the remaining amount the Indemnified Party will
be entitled to recover pursuant to this Article 8 as a result of the
limitations set forth in this Agreement (including the Cap). Following an
assumption of defense of a Third-Party Proceeding by an Indemnifying Party
under this Agreement, the Indemnifying Party will have no liability for any
fees of legal counsel or other expenses subsequently incurred by the
Indemnified Party in connection with such Proceeding. If an Indemnifying Party
assumes the defense of a Third-Party Proceeding, no compromise or settlement
of the underlying claims may be effected by it without the Indemnified Party's
consent (which will not be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned),
unless: (x) the sole relief provided is monetary damages that are paid in
full or otherwise provided for by the Indemnifying Party concurrently with the
compromise or settlement; and (y) such compromise or settlement provides for
a complete release from liability of the Indemnified Parties with respect to
the claim(s) asserted against the Indemnified Parties in the applicable Third
Party Proceeding. If an Indemnifying Party assumes the defense of a Third-
Party Proceeding, the Indemnified Party will not settle such Proceeding
without the prior written consent of the Indemnifying Party; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that the Indemnified Party will have the right to settle any such
Proceeding without the prior written consent of the Indemnifying Party if the
Indemnified Party first waives any right to indemnity under this
Agreement with respect to such Proceeding or any related claim under this
Agreement. Without impairing an Indemnified Party's right to seek
indemnification, if an Indemnifying Party does not timely elect to, or is not
permitted to, assume the defense of a Third-Party Proceeding, the terms of
any settlement of such Proceeding by the Indemnified Party (including with
respect to the amount of any Adverse Consequences) will not be binding on an
Indemnifying Party for purposes of determining such Indemnifying
Party's indemnification obligations under this Agreement (including the
amount of any Adverse Consequences) unless the Indemnifying Party consents to
such settlement in writing.

    

Stock Purchase Agreement

(iii) The assumption of the defense of any Third-Party Proceeding by
an Indemnifying Party will not constitute an admission of responsibility to
indemnify or in any manner impair or restrict that Indemnifying Party's rights
to later seek to be reimbursed for its costs and expenses if indemnification
with respect to such Proceeding was not required. If an Indemnifying Party
timely elects to assume the defense of a Third-Party Proceeding but
subsequently determines in good faith that indemnification with respect
to such Proceeding is not required under this Article 8, such Indemnifying
Party may elect to transfer the defense back to the Indemnified Party, but
solely to the extent such transfer can be accomplished in a manner that would
not materially and irreparably prejudice the rights of the Indemnified Party.

  



  

(iv) Except to the extent it would cause a waiver of a privilege, each
Party will make available to the Other Party and the Other
Party's Representatives all of its Books and Records and, as applicable,
employees relating to a Third-Party Proceeding as may be reasonably requested
by the Other Party, and each Party will reasonably cooperate to insure the
proper and adequate defense of such Third-Party Proceeding.

  



  

(b) Other Claims. A claim for indemnification for any matter not
involving a Third-Party Proceeding must be asserted by written notice to
Buyer, if indemnification is sought against Buyer, or to the applicable Seller
or Sellers (or the Seller Representative), if indemnification is sought
against a Seller or Sellers, as applicable: (i) describing in reasonable
detail the nature of and the underlying factual and legal basis for such
claim; (ii) stating the estimated amount of the claim (if then reasonably
quantifiable) and describing in reasonable detail the basis on which such
amount was calculated; and (iii) identifying the provisions of this Agreement
upon which such claim is based. The failure to timely notify the Indemnifying
Party or provide the information described above will not relieve the
Indemnifying Party of any liability that the Indemnifying Party may have to an
Indemnified Party except to the extent that the defense of such Third-Party
Proceeding was actually prejudiced by the Indemnified Party's failure to
provide timely notice or such information.

following:

  



  

(a) with respect to any Adverse Consequences under Section 8.2(a)(i)

to the contrary contained in this Agreement, except as provided in Section
8.6(e); or claims based on Actual Fraud by Sellers, a claim for
recovery against the then-remaining Escrow Funds and the RandW Insurance Policy
will be the sole and exclusive recourse and remedy of the Buyer Indemnified
Parties for any Adverse Consequences under Section 8.2(a)(i), Section
8.2(b)(i) or for Adverse Consequences arising out of or related to any breach
of or inaccuracy in any statement made in any certificate relating thereto

Section 8.2 (other than Section 8.2(a)(i) and Section 8.2(b)(i)), such
Adverse Consequences will be recovered from Sellers or the applicable Seller;
_provided_ ,  _that_ , for the avoidance of doubt and notwithstanding
anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, the aggregate maximum
amount of Adverse Consequences for which the Buyer Indemnified Parties may
recover from any Seller under this Article 8 (including in respect of claims
based on Actual Fraud by Sellers) will in no event exceed the applicable
Seller Aggregate Cap. For purposes of this Agreement, the term "Seller
Aggregate Cap" means, with respect to any Seller, the amount of the Purchase
Price actually received by such Seller;

  



  

(c) If Adverse Consequences resulting from a breach of the
representations in Section 2.10 which impacts the validity of the Section
338(h)(10) Election contemplated by Section 5.7(j) exceeds the sum of the
Basket, the Cap and the RandW Insurance Policy coverage of $50,000,000, Sellers
will reimburse Buyer for such Adverse Consequences in excess of the Basket,
Cap, and RandW Insurance Policy coverage of $50,000,000, to the extent of tax
refunds received by Sellers as a result of such breach;

  



  

(d) No claims shall be made that any representation or warranty is
breached based on the amount or methodology used by Company or
Subsidiaries for the warranty reserve or legal settlement reserve used in the
Financial Statements; and

for the avoidance of doubt, with respect to any Adverse Consequences related
to claims for breaches of Section 2.2, Section 3.1, and/or Section 3.3, the
Adverse Consequences will be recovered: (i) _first_ , from the Escrow Funds
(and Buyer and the Seller Representative will execute the necessary
documents instructing the Escrow Agent to make the applicable payments in
accordance with the Escrow Agreement, subject to the terms and conditions of
this Agreement and the Escrow Agreement); (ii) _second_ , subject to the
Seller Aggregate Cap, from Sellers until the retention amount of $9,000,000

recovery under the RandW Insurance Policy up to the policy coverage limit of
$50,000,000; and (iv) _fourth_ , subject to the Seller Aggregate Cap, from
the Sellers up to the Purchase Price.

  



  

 _Section 8.7_ _Subrogation_. Upon making any payment of a claim for
indemnification to an Indemnified Party in respect of any Adverse
Consequences pursuant to this Article 8, the Indemnifying Party will, to the
extent of such payment, be subrogated to all rights of the Indemnified Party
against any third party ( _i.e._ , not a Seller or Affiliate of a Seller) in
respect of the Adverse Consequences to which such payment relates. Such
Indemnified Party and Indemnifying Party will execute upon request all
instruments reasonably necessary to evidence or further perfect such
subrogation rights.

  



  

 _Section 8.8_ _Adjusted Purchase Price._ Any payment of a claim for
indemnification under this Article 8 will be accounted for as an adjustment
to the Purchase Price for all Tax purposes to the extent permitted by
applicable Law.

  



  

 _Section 8.9_ _Exclusive Remedy; R andW Insurance Policy._

  



  

(a) Except for the matters covered by Section 1.3 _,_ a Party's
right to seek specific performance or other equitable relief pursuant to
Section 10.11 or claims based on Actual Fraud by Buyer or Sellers (but
subject, in each case, to the applicable limitations set forth in this
Agreement, including those relating to the Seller Aggregate Cap), this Article
8 constitutes the sole and exclusive remedy of the Buyer Indemnified Parties
and the Seller Indemnified Parties with respect to any matters arising under
or with respect to this Agreement or relating to or arising from the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement;

  



  

(b) Adverse Consequences suffered or incurred by any Buyer
Indemnified Party will be recoverable solely from the applicable sources, and
in accordance with the applicable order of priority, set forth in Section
8.6, and the Buyer Indemnified Parties hereby acknowledge and agree any that
the liability of Sellers (or any Seller) to the Buyer Indemnified Parties for
Adverse Consequences under any other provision of Section 8.2 (or otherwise
relating to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement) will be subject
to the limitations set forth in Section 8.6 and elsewhere in this Agreement;
it being understood and agreed by the Buyer Indemnified Parties that no
Seller will have any liability for, and no Buyer Indemnified Party will be
entitled to recovery from any Seller for, Adverse Consequences (including
Adverse Consequences with respect to claims based on Actual Fraud of Sellers)
in an amount in excess of such Seller's Seller Aggregate Cap; and

(c) In the case of each of clauses (a) and (b) above, each Party (on
behalf of itself and the Buyer Indemnified Parties, in the case of Buyer, and
on behalf of itself and the Seller Indemnified Parties, in the case of
Sellers) hereby irrevocably waives from and after Closing, to the fullest
extent permitted under applicable Law, any and all rights, claims and causes
of action that it may have or may in the future have against the Other Party
relating to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

A Party may change its address, facsimile number or email address by prior
written notice to the other Party provided as set forth in this Section 10.6.

  



  

 _Section 10.7_ _Counterparts. _ This Agreement may be executed by
original signature or by facsimile, digital or other electronic signature and
in one or more counterparts, each of which will be deemed an original and
together will constitute one and the same instrument.

  



  

 _Section 10.8_ _Expenses. _ Except as otherwise expressly provided in
this Agreement, Sellers, on one hand, and Buyer, on the other hand, will
each pay all of their own expenses, costs and fees (including legal and other
professional fees and costs) incurred in connection with the negotiation,
preparation, execution and delivery of this Agreement and the other
Transaction Documents and the consummation of the transactions contemplated
by them (whether the transactions contemplated by this Agreement are
consummated or not).

  



  

 _Section 10.9_ _Headings; Construction; Time of Essence._ The headings
of the articles, sections and paragraphs in this Agreement have been
inserted for convenience of reference only and will not restrict or otherwise
modify any of the provisions of this Agreement. Unless otherwise expressly
provided, the words "including", "include" or "includes", or other similar
words, whenever used in this Agreement will be deemed to be immediately
followed by the words "without limitation." The words "herein", "hereby",
"hereof", "hereunder" and words of similar import refer to this Agreement as
a whole (including any exhibits and schedules to this Agreement) and not
merely to any particular section, subsection or paragraph contained in this
Agreement. All references in this agreement to Sections, Schedules or Exhibits
are references to Sections of, and Exhibits and Schedules to, this Agreement,
unless the context otherwise requires. References in this Agreement to any
gender include references to all genders, and references to the singular
include references to the plural and vice versa. Neither this Agreement nor
any other Transaction Document (nor any uncertainty or ambiguity in it or
them) will be construed against a Party under any rule of construction or
otherwise. No Party will be considered the draftsman of this Agreement or any
other Transaction Document. The provisions of this Agreement have been
negotiated by and chosen by the Parties to express their mutual intent, and
no rule of strict construction will be applied against a Party. All references
to dollars or "$" in this Agreement or any other Transaction Document are to
U.S. Dollars. For purposes of determining the Final Closing Cash Payment,
the calculation of each component will be determined without duplication of
amounts taken into account in the calculation of any other component.

 _Section 10.10_   _Partial Invalidity._ Whenever possible, each provision
of this Agreement and each other Transaction Document will be interpreted in
such manner as to be effective and valid under applicable Law, but in case any
one or more of the provisions contained in this Agreement or other
Transaction Document is, for any reason, held by a court of competent
jurisdiction to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable in any respect, such
invalidity, illegality or unenforceability will not affect any other
provision of this Agreement or other Transaction Document, as applicable,
which will otherwise remain in full force and effect. Upon any such
determination that any provision of this Agreement or other Transaction
Document is invalid, illegal or unenforceable, the Parties will negotiate in
good faith to modify this Agreement or other Transaction Document, as
applicable, by replacing the invalid, illegal or unenforceable provisions
with legal, valid and enforceable provisions the effect of which comes as
close as practicable to the original intent of the Parties in order that the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement are consummated as
originally contemplated to the greatest extent possible.

  



  

 _Section 10.11_   _Specific Performance._ The Parties agree that
irreparable damage could occur to the non-breaching Party if any provision of
this Agreement were not performed by a Party in accordance with its terms.
Accordingly, the Parties agree that, subject to the limitations set forth in
this Section 10.11, in addition to any other remedy to which a non-breaching
Party is entitled at Law or in equity, the non-breaching Party will be
entitled to seek injunctive relief to prevent breaches of this Agreement and
will be entitled to specifically enforce the performance of the provisions of
this Agreement. The Parties agree and acknowledge that by seeking the
remedies provided for in this Section 10.11, a Party will not in any respect
waive its right to seek any other form of relief that may be available to
such Party under this Agreement or in the event that the remedies provided
for in this Section 10.11 are not available or otherwise are not granted. Each
Party agrees that it will not oppose the granting of an injunction, specific
performance and other equitable relief on the basis that the other Party
has an adequate remedy at Law or an award of specific performance is not an
appropriate remedy for any reason at Law or equity. Any Party seeking an
injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce
specifically the terms and provisions of this Agreement will not be required
to provide any bond or other security in connection with any such order or
injunction.

  



  

 _Section 10.12_ _Records; Representation by Barnes and Thornburg LLP;
Privileged Communications._ In the event of any dispute following Closing
between Buyer or any of its Affiliates (including the Company), on the one
hand, and one or more Sellers, on the other hand, Buyer and the Company
consent to the representation by Barnes and Thornburg LLP of such Seller or
Sellers notwithstanding the prior representation of the Company or
Subsidiaries by Barnes and Thornburg LLP, and Buyer and the Company and
Subsidiaries waive any right to object to such representations on the basis of
any conflict of interest arising from such representation or similar claim.
Buyer acknowledges and agrees that as to all pre-Closing communications
between or among any Seller or Sellers and/or the Company or Subsidiaries and
their respective employees and agents, on one hand, and their respective
legal counsel (including Barnes and Thornburg LLP), on the other hand, relating
to the Transaction Documents or the transactions contemplated by them, the
attorney-client privilege, the expectation of client confidence and all other
rights to any evidentiary privilege belong to and may be controlled by
Sellers, and will not pass to or be claimed by Buyer or any of its Affiliates
(including, following Closing, the Company and Subsidiaries). The Company may
remove from its records, all privileged communications and attorney-client
work product relating to this Agreement and the facts and circumstances
relating to it; provided, however, that Seller Representative shall cause
such records to be preserved for a period of no less than one (1) year
after the Closing (the "Record Retention Period"), and before removing any
such records, but in no event later than fourteen (14) days following the
removal of such records, the Seller Representative shall certify to Buyer in
writing the following information: (i) the identity of the vendor who will be
performing the search and removal of such records, (ii) the search terms and
removal parameters or criteria to be used by such vendor, (iii) the estimated
number of documents and volume of data to be removed, and (iv) the identity
of the proposed custodian of the removed records for the Record Retention
Period. At the Closing, the Seller Representative shall provide a written
update of the number of documents and volume of data removed and the
telephone number of the custodian of any removed records for the Retention
Period.
