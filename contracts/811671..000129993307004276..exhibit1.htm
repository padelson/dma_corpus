conditions hereof and the manner and mode of carrying it into effect, which

ARTICLE I    

The Merger    

1.1 _The Merger_. (a) Subject to the terms and conditions of this Plan, at
the Effective Time (as hereinafter defined), the Company shall merge with and
into Parent (the " _Merger_ "), and the separate corporate existence of the
Company shall thereupon cease. Parent shall be the surviving corporation in
the Merger (hereinafter sometimes referred to as the "
_Surviving Corporation_ ") and shall continue to be governed by the laws of
the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania.   

(b) The Merger shall have the effects specified in this Plan and the Business
Corporation Law of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania (the " _PBCL_ ").   

(c) At the Effective Time, the Articles of Incorporation of Parent, as then in
effect, shall be the articles of incorporation of the Surviving Corporation
and the By-Laws of Parent, as then in effect, shall be the By-Laws of the
Surviving Corporation.   

(d) The name of the Surviving Corporation shall be the name of Parent.   

1.2 _Effective Time_. (a) Subject to the terms and conditions of this Plan,
on or before the Closing Date, the parties will execute and Parent will cause

Commonwealth of Pennsylvania as provided in Sections 1926 and 1927 of the

(b) Parent and the Company will each cause the Effective Time to occur not
later than the fifth business day following the satisfaction or waiver of the
last of the conditions specified in Sections 6.1(a), (b), (d) and (e) of this
Plan. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Section 1.2(b), Parent
and the Company may cause the Effective Time to occur on such earlier
or later day following the satisfaction or waiver of such conditions as they
may agree, consistent with the provisions of the PBCL. If the last of the
conditions set forth in Article VI are satisfied or waived during the two
weeks immediately prior to the end of a calendar quarter of Parent, then
Parent may postpone the Effective Time until the first full week after the end
of that fiscal quarter, _provided_ that it is understood and agreed that
Parent may not postpone the Effective Time longer than such one week period,
including by asserting that any of the conditions specified in Sections
6.1(a), (b), (d) and (e) of this Plan are no longer satisfied or waived.   

1.3 _Closing_. The closing of the Merger (the " _Closing_ ") shall take place
at such time and place as Parent and the Company shall agree, on the date
when the Effective Time is to occur (the " _Closing Date_ ").   

1.4 _Bank Mergers_. As soon as practicable after the execution and delivery of
this Plan, (1) PNC Bank, National Association and BLC Bank, National
Association shall enter into an agreement, pursuant to which BLC Bank,

"). The parties intend that the Bank Mergers will become effective
simultaneously with or immediately following the Effective Time.   

ARTICLE II    

Conversion or Cancellation of Shares    

2.1 _Conversion or Cancellation of Shares_. At the Effective Time, by virtue
of the Merger and without any action on the part of any shareholder:   

(a) _Company Common Stock_. Each share of Company Common Stock issued and
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time, other than Exception
Shares (as hereinafter defined), shall be converted into the right to
receive, at the election of each holder thereof, but subject to the election
and allocation procedures of Sections 2.1(d) and (e), the other provisions of
this Section 2.1 and possible adjustment as set forth in Section 2.4,
either:   

(1) that number of fully paid and nonassessable shares of Parent Common Stock
equal to the result obtained by dividing the Per Share Consideration by the
Parent Share Price (the " _Per Share Stock Consideration_ "), or   

(2) an amount in cash, without interest, equal to the Per Share Consideration
(the " _Per Share Cash Consideration_ " and, together with the Per Share
Stock Consideration, the " _Consideration_ ").   

(b) _Parent Common Stock_. Each share of Parent Common Stock outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall remain outstanding as one share
of common stock of the Surviving Corporation.   

(c) _Cancellation of Old Shares_. Each share of Company Common Stock issued
and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time, other than Exception
Shares, is hereinafter defined as an " _Old Share_ ". Old Shares shall cease
to be outstanding, shall be canceled and retired and shall cease to exist,
and each holder of a certificate (an " _Old Certificate_ ") formerly
representing Old Shares shall thereafter cease to have any rights with
respect to such shares, except the right to receive, without interest, upon
exchange of such Old Certificate in accordance with Section 2.3, the
Consideration.   

(d) Subject to the allocation procedures set forth in Section 2.1(e), each
record holder of Company Common Stock will be entitled (i) to elect to
receive shares of Parent Common Stock (a " _Stock Election_ ") for all or
some of the shares of Company Common Stock (" _Stock Election Shares_ ") held
by such record holder, (ii) to elect to receive cash (a " _Cash Election_ ")
for all or some of the shares of Company Common Stock (" _Cash Election
Shares_ ") held by such record holder or (iii) to indicate that such holder
makes no such election (a " _No-Election_ ") for all or some of the shares of
Company Common Stock (" _No-Election Shares_ ") held by such record holder.
All such elections (each, an " _Election_ ") shall be made on a form designed
for that purpose and agreed to by Parent and the Company (an " _Election
Form_ "). Any shares of Company Common Stock for which the record holder has
not, as of the Election Deadline (as defined below), properly submitted to the
Exchange Agent a properly completed Election Form will be deemed No-Election
Shares. A record holder acting in different capacities or acting on behalf of
other persons in any way will be entitled to submit an Election Form for each
capacity in which such record holder so acts with respect to each person
for which it so acts. The exchange agent (the " _Exchange Agent_ ") will be a
bank or trust company in the United States selected by Parent and reasonably
acceptable to the Company.   

(e) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Plan, the allocation
among the holders of shares of Company Common Stock of rights to receive the
Per Share Stock Consideration or the Per Share Cash Consideration will be
made as follows:   

(1) _Number of Stock Elections Less Than the Stock Conversion Number_. If the
aggregate number of Stock Election Shares (on the basis of Election Forms
received as of the Election Deadline) is less than a number equal to the
number of Exchangeable Shares minus the result obtained by dividing (x) the
product of the number of Exchangeable Shares and the Signing Cash Amount by
(y) the Per Share Consideration (the " _Stock Conversion Number_ "),
then    

(A) each Stock Election Share will be, as of the Effective Time, converted
into the right to receive the Per Share Stock Consideration,    

(B) the Exchange Agent will allocate from among the No-Election Shares, pro
rata to the holders of No-Election Shares in accordance with their respective
numbers of No-Election Shares, a sufficient number of No-Election Shares so
that the sum of such number and the number of Stock Election Shares equals as
closely as practicable the Stock Conversion Number, and each such allocated
No-Election Share (each, a " _Stock-Selected No-Election Share_ ") will be,
as of the Effective Time, converted into the right to receive the Per Share
Stock Consideration, _provided_ that if the sum of all No-Election Shares
and Stock Election Shares is equal to or less than the Stock Conversion
Number, all No-Election Shares will be Stock-Selected No-Election
Shares,    

(C) if the sum of Stock Election Shares and No-Election Shares is less than
the Stock Conversion Number, the Exchange Agent will allocate from among the
Cash Election Shares, pro rata to the holders of Cash Election Shares in
accordance with their respective numbers of Cash Election Shares, a
sufficient number of Cash Election Shares so that the sum of such number, the
number of all Stock Election Shares and the number of all No-Election Shares
equals as closely as practicable the Stock Conversion Number, and each
such allocated Cash Election Share (each, a " _Converted Cash Election Share_
") will be, as of the Effective Time, converted into the right to receive the
Per Share Stock Consideration, and    

(D) each No-Election Share and Cash Election Share that is not a Stock-
Selected No-Election Share or a Converted Cash Election Share (as the case
may be) will be, as of the Effective Time, converted into the right to
receive the Per Share Cash Consideration.   

(2) _Number of Stock Elections Greater Than the Stock Conversion Number_. If
the aggregate number of Stock Election Shares (on the basis of Election Forms
received by the Election Deadline) is greater than the Stock Conversion
Number, then    

(A) each Cash Election Share and No-Election Share will be, as of the
Effective Time, converted into the right to receive the Per Share Cash
Consideration,    

(B) the Exchange Agent will allocate from among the Stock Election Shares, pro
rata to the holders of Stock Election Shares in accordance with their
respective numbers of Stock Election Shares, a sufficient number of Stock
Election Shares (" _Converted Stock Election Shares_ ") so that the
difference of (x) the number of Stock Election Shares less (y) the number of
the Converted Stock Election Shares equals as closely as practicable the
Stock Conversion Number, and each Converted Stock Election Share will be, as
of the Effective Time, converted into the right to receive the Per Share Cash
Consideration, and    

(C) each Stock Election Share that is not a Converted Stock Election Share
will be, as of the Effective Time, converted into the right to receive the
Per Share Stock Consideration.   

(3) _Number of Stock Elections is Equal to the Stock Conversion Number_. If
the aggregate number of Stock Election Shares (on the basis of Election Forms
received by the Election Deadline) is equal to the Stock Conversion Number,
then    

(A) each Stock Election Share will be, as of the Effective Time, converted
into the right to receive the Per Share Stock Consideration, and    

(B) each Cash Election Share and No-Election Share will be, as of the
Effective Time, converted into the right to receive the Per Share Cash
Consideration.   

(f) _Certain Definitions_.   

(1) " _Parent Share Price_ " means the arithmetic average of the last reported
per share sales prices of Parent Common Stock on the New York Stock Exchange
(the " _NYSE_ "), as reported in the New York City edition of _The Wall
Street Journal_ or, if not reported therein, another authoritative source
mutually agreed to by Parent and the Company, for each of the five full
consecutive trading days ending on the trading day immediately prior to the
Closing Date.   

(2) " _Exchangeable Shares_ " means the aggregate number of shares of Company
Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time,
excluding Exception Shares, rounded to the nearest whole share.   

(3) " _Per Share Consideration_ " means the sum, rounded to the nearest whole
cent, of (a) $7.60 (the " _Signing Cash Amount_ ") _plus_ (b) the product,
rounded to the nearest one ten-thousandth, of 0.1543 (such number being the "
_Signing Exchange Ratio_ ") and the Parent Share Price.   

(g) _Exception Shares_. At the Effective Time, (1) each Exception Share owned
by Parent or the Company shall be cancelled and retired and shall cease to
exist and no consideration shall be delivered in exchange therefor, and (2)
each Exception Share held by any direct or indirect wholly owned subsidiary
of Parent or the Company shall be converted into the right to receive the Per
Share Stock Consideration. The Per Share Stock Consideration payable pursuant
to this Section 2.1(g) shall not be subject to, and will not be deemed to be
Stock Election Shares or otherwise taken into account in calculating,
adjustments under Section 2.1(e). " _Exception Share_ " means a share of
Company Common Stock owned or held, other than in a bona fide fiduciary or
agency capacity or in satisfaction of a debt previously contracted in good
faith, by Parent, the Company or a subsidiary of either.   

2.2 _Fractional Shares_. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Article
II, no fractional shares of Parent Common Stock will be issued pursuant to
the Merger. Instead, Parent will pay or cause to be paid to the holder of any
Old Shares that would, pursuant to paragraph 2.1, otherwise be entitled to
receive fractional shares of Parent Common Stock an amount in cash, rounded
to the nearest cent and without interest, equal to the product of (i) the
fraction of a share to which such holder would otherwise have been entitled
and (ii) the Measurement Price. As used in this Plan, the term " _Measurement
Price_ " means the average of the daily high and low per share sales prices
of Parent Common Stock on the New York Stock Exchange (the " _NYSE_ "), as
reported in the New York City edition of _The Wall Street Journal_ or, if not
reported therein, in another authoritative source mutually agreed by Parent
and the Company, for the last trading day immediately prior to the Closing
Date.   

2.3 _Exchange of Old Certificates for New Certificates_.   

(a) _Exchange Agent._ At or before the Effective Time, Parent shall make
available or cause to be made available to the Exchange Agent certificates
or, at Parents option, evidence of shares in book entry form (each, a " _New
Certificate_ "), representing the shares of Parent Common Stock (each, a "
_New Share_ ") and cash in amounts sufficient to allow the Exchange Agent to
make all deliveries of New Certificates and payments that may be required in
exchange for Old Certificates pursuant to this Article II (collectively, the
" _Exchange Fund_ "). Any portion of the Exchange Fund that remains unclaimed
by the shareholders of the Company as of the first anniversary of the
Effective Time may, to the extent permitted by applicable law, be paid to
Parent. In such event, any holder of Old Certificates who has not theretofore
exchanged his or her Old Certificates for New Certificates and/or cash
pursuant to this Article II shall thereafter be entitled to look exclusively
to Parent, and only as a general creditor thereof in the case of cash, for
the shares of Parent Common Stock and/or cash to which he or she may be
entitled upon exchange of such Old Certificates pursuant to this Article II,
in each case, without any interest thereon. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, neither the Exchange Agent nor any party hereto, shall be liable
to any holder of Old Certificates for any amount properly delivered to a
public official pursuant to applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar
laws.   

(b) _Exchange Procedures_.   

(1) Parent shall cause the Exchange Agent to provide the Form of Election to
holders of record of Company Common Stock (other than holders of Exception
Shares), together with appropriate transmittal materials, at the time of
mailing of the Proxy Statement to the holders of record of Company Common
Stock, or on such other date as the Company and Parent shall mutually agree so
as to minimize the impact of limitations under applicable law relating to
Parent share repurchases that might apply with respect thereto, and
thereafter from time to time as the Company may reasonably request until
three days prior to the Election Deadline, to each person who is a holder of
record of Company Common Stock for purposes of the Company Meeting. Elections
shall be made by mailing to the Exchange Agent a duly completed Form of
Election. A Form of Election may specify which specific shares covered
thereby are subject to a Cash Election, a Stock Election or a No-Election. To
be effective, a Form of Election must be (1) properly completed, signed and
submitted to the Exchange Agent at its designated office, by 5:00 p.m. local
time (in the city in which the principal office of the Exchange Agent is
located) on the later of the day prior to the Company Meeting and the date
that the parties believe to be as near as practicable to five business
days prior to the anticipated Closing Date, taking into account PNCs
intention to minimize the impact of limitations under applicable law relating
to Parent share repurchases that might apply (or such other time and date as
the Company and Parent may mutually agree) (the " _Election Deadline_ ")
and (2) accompanied by the certificate(s) representing the shares of Company
Common Stock as to which the election is being made (or by an appropriate
guarantee of delivery of such certificate(s) by a commercial bank or trust
company in the United States or a member of a registered national
security exchange or of the NASD, _provided_ that such certificates are in
fact delivered to the Exchange Agent within three trading days after the date
of execution of such guarantee of delivery; failure to deliver shares of
Company Common Stock covered by such a guarantee of delivery within the
time set forth on such guarantee shall be deemed to invalidate any otherwise
properly made Election, unless otherwise determined by Parent, in its sole
discretion). Parent will determine, in its sole and absolute discretion,
which authority it may delegate in whole or in part to the Exchange
Agent, whether Forms of Election have been properly completed, signed and
submitted or revoked. The decision of Parent (or the Exchange Agent, as the
case may be) in such matters shall be conclusive and binding. Neither Parent
nor the Exchange Agent will be under any obligation to notify any person of
any defect in a Form of Election submitted to the Exchange Agent. A holder of
shares of Company Common Stock that does not submit an effective Form of
Election prior to the Election Deadline shall be deemed to have made a No-
Election. An election may be revoked, but only by written notice received by
the Exchange Agent prior to the Election Deadline. Any
certificate(s) representing shares of Company Common Stock that have been
submitted to the Exchange Agent in connection with an election shall be
returned without charge to the holder thereof in the event such election is
revoked as aforesaid and such holder requests in writing the return of
such certificate(s). Upon any such revocation, unless a duly completed Form
of Election is thereafter submitted prior to the Election Deadline and
otherwise in accordance with this Section, such shares shall be deemed No-
Election Shares. The Exchange Agent, in consultation with Parent and
the Company, will make all computations to give effect to this Section.   

(2) As promptly as reasonably practicable following the Effective Time, taking
into account the computations contemplated by Section 2.1(e), each holder of
record of Company Common Stock that has surrendered the certificates
representing its Company Common Stock will be entitled to receive a New
Certificate representing the shares of Parent Common Stock issuable in
exchange therefor and/or a check representing cash payable pursuant to this
Article II. No interest will accrue or be paid with respect to any New
Certificates or cash to be delivered upon surrender of Old Certificates. If
any New Certificate is to be issued or cash is to be paid in a name other
than that in which the Old Certificate surrendered in exchange therefor is
registered, it will be a condition to the exchange that the person requesting
the exchange (1) pay any transfer or other Taxes required by reason of the
issuance of the New Certificate or the making of the cash payment in a name
other than the name of the holder of the surrendered Old Certificate or (2)
establish to the satisfaction of Parent (or the Exchange Agent, as the case
may be) that any such Taxes have been paid or are not applicable.   

(3) As promptly as reasonably practicable following the Effective Time Parent
shall cause the Exchange Agent to mail or deliver to each person who was,
immediately prior to the Effective Time, a holder of record of Company Common
Stock and who theretofore has not submitted such holders Old Certificates
with an Election Form, a form of letter of transmittal (which shall specify
that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to Old
Certificates shall pass, only upon proper delivery of such certificates to
the Exchange Agent) containing instructions for use in effecting the
surrender of Old Certificates in exchange for the consideration to which such
person may be entitled pursuant to this Article II.   

(c) _Distributions with Respect to Unexchanged Shares_. No dividends or other
distributions with respect to Parent Common Stock having a record date after
the Effective Time will be paid to any holder of Company Common Stock until
such holder has surrendered the Old Certificate representing such stock as
provided herein. Subject to the effect of applicable law, following surrender
of any such Old Certificates, there shall be paid to the holder of New
Certificates issued in exchange therefor, without interest, the amount of
dividends or other distributions with a record date after the Effective Time
previously payable with respect to the shares of Parent Common Stock
represented thereby. To the extent permitted by law, holders of Company Common
Stock who receive Parent Common Stock in the Merger shall be entitled to vote
after the Effective Time at any meeting of Parent shareholders the number of
whole shares of Parent Common Stock into which their respective shares of
Company Common Stock are converted, regardless of whether such holders of
Company Common Stock have exchanged their Old Certificates for New
Certificates in accordance with the provisions of this Plan, but beginning 30
days after the Effective Time no such holder shall be entitled to vote on any
matter until such holder surrenders such Old Certificate for exchange as
provided in Section 2.3(b)(1).   

(d) _Transfers_. At or after the Effective Time, there shall be no transfers
on the stock transfer books of the Surviving Corporation of Old Shares.   

(e) _Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates_. If any Old Certificate shall
have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that
fact by the individual, bank, corporation, partnership, trust, association or
other entity or organization (any of the foregoing, a " _Person_ ") claiming
such Old Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if required by
the Surviving Corporation or the Exchange Agent, the posting by such Person
of a bond in such reasonable amount as the Surviving Corporation or the
Exchange Agent may direct as indemnity against any claim that may be made
against it with respect to such Old Certificate, the Surviving Corporation or
the Exchange Agent shall, in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed
Old Certificate, issue or cause to be issued a New Certificate and pay or
cause to be paid the amounts, if any, deliverable in respect to the Old
Shares formerly represented by such Old Certificate pursuant to this Article
II.   

2.4 _Adjustment of Consideration_. If Parent changes (or the board of
directors of Parent sets a related record date that will occur before the
Effective Time for a change in) the number or kind of shares of Parent Common
Stock outstanding by way of a stock split, stock dividend, recapitalization,
reclassification, reorganization or similar transaction, the Signing Exchange
Ratio will be adjusted proportionately to account for such change.   

2.5 _Withholding Rights_. Each of Parent, the Surviving Corporation and the
Exchange Agent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the
consideration otherwise payable to any Person pursuant to this Agreement such
amounts as it is required to deduct and withhold under the Code and the rules
and regulations promulgated thereunder, or any provision of state, local
or foreign Tax law. To the extent that amounts are so deducted or withheld by
Parent, the Surviving Corporation or the Exchange Agent, as the case may be,
such withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Plan as
having been paid to the Person in respect to which such deduction
and withholding was made.

not be considered a material increase in cost), and (3) to satisfy
Previously Disclosed contractual obligations.   

(e) _Benefit Plans._ Enter into, establish, adopt or amend any Benefit Plan,

such contract or agreement.

ARTICLE IV    

Representations    

4.1 _Disclosure Schedules_. On or prior to the date hereof, Parent has
delivered to the Company a schedule and the Company has delivered to Parent a
schedule (respectively, each schedule a " _Disclosure Schedule_ ") setting
forth, among other things, items the disclosure of which is necessary or
appropriate either in response to an express disclosure requirement contained
in a provision hereof or as an exception to one or more representations
contained in Section 4.3 or to one or more of its covenants contained herein;
provided that the mere inclusion of an item in a Disclosure Schedule as an
exception to a representation shall not be deemed an admission by a
party that such item was required to be disclosed therein.   

4.2 _Standard_. (a) For all purposes of this Plan, no representation of Parent
or the Company contained in Section 4.3 (other than the representations
contained in Section 4.3(b), which shall be true and correct in all material
respects, and in Section 4.3(g)(3), which shall be true and correct in all
respects) shall be deemed untrue and no party hereto shall be deemed to
have breached a representation, as a consequence of the existence of any
fact, event or circumstance unless such fact, circumstance or event,
individually or taken together with all other facts, events or circumstances
inconsistent with any representation contained in Section 4.3 (read for this
purpose without regard to any individual reference to "materiality" or
"Material Adverse Effect" set forth therein) has had or is reasonably likely
to have a Material Adverse Effect with respect to Parent or the Company, as
the case may be.   

(b) The term " _Material Adverse Effect_ " means an effect which (1) is
materially adverse to the business, financial condition or results of
operations of Parent or the Company, as the context may dictate, and its
subsidiaries, taken as a whole, or (2) materially impairs the ability of
Parent or the Company to consummate the Merger; _provided_ , _however_ , that
in determining whether a Material Adverse Effect has occurred under clause
(1) there shall be excluded any effect to the extent attributable to or
resulting from (A) any changes in laws, regulations or interpretations of
laws or regulations generally affecting the banking or bank holding company
businesses, but not uniquely relating to Parent or the Company, (B) any
change in generally accepted accounting principles or regulatory accounting
requirements, generally affecting the banking or bank holding
company businesses, but not uniquely relating to Parent or the Company, (C)
events, conditions or trends in economic, business or financial conditions

for securities), except to the extent any such events, conditions or trends
in economic, business or financial conditions have a disproportionate adverse
effect upon such party, (D) changes in national or international political or
social conditions including the engagement by the United States in
hostilities, whether or not pursuant to the declaration of a national

diplomatic or consular offices or upon any military installation, equipment
or personnel of the United States, (E) actions or omissions of Parent or the
Company taken with the prior written consent of the other party in

the transactions contemplated hereby.   

4.3 _Representations_. Except as Previously Disclosed, the Company hereby
represents and warrants to Parent, and Parent hereby represents and warrants
to the Company, to the extent applicable, in each case with respect to itself
and its subsidiaries, as follows:   

(a) _Organization, Standing and Authority_. It is a corporation duly
organized, validly existing and in good standing under the laws of the

foreign jurisdictions where its ownership or leasing of property or assets or
the conduct of its business requires it to be so qualified.   

(b) _Capital Stock_.   

(1) The information in Recital A, in the case of Parent, and in Recital B, in
the case of the Company, is true and correct.   

(2) Its outstanding shares of common stock have been duly authorized and are

solicitation materials of the Company constituting a part thereof (the "
_Proxy Statement_ ") and all related documents). The parties agree to
cooperate in the preparation of the Registration Statement and the Proxy
Statement. Subject to Section 5.1(b), each of Parent and the Company agrees
to use all reasonable best efforts to cause the Registration Statement to be
declared effective under the Securities Act as promptly as reasonably
practicable after filing thereof, and the Company shall thereafter mail or
deliver the Proxy Statement to its shareholders; provided, however, that the
parties will coordinate the timing of the mailing of the Proxy Statement and
related Election materials so as to minimize the impact of limitations under
applicable law relating to Parent share repurchases that might apply
with respect thereto. Parent also agrees to use all reasonable best efforts
to obtain all necessary state securities law or "Blue Sky" permits and
approvals required to carry out the transactions contemplated by this Plan.
Each of Parent and the Company agrees to furnish all information concerning
it, its subsidiaries, officers, directors and shareholders as may be
reasonably requested in connection with the foregoing.   

(b) Each of Parent and the Company agrees (1) as to itself and its
subsidiaries, that none of the information supplied or to be supplied by it
for inclusion or incorporation by reference in (a) the Registration Statement
will, at the time the Registration Statement and each amendment or supplement
thereto, if any, becomes effective under the Securities Act, contain any
untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact
required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not
misleading and (b) the Proxy Statement and any amendment or supplement
thereto will, at the date of mailing to shareholders and at the time of
the Company Meeting contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit
to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make
the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which such
statement was made, not misleading and (2) that the Registration Statement
and Proxy Statement shall comply with all applicable laws as they relate to
Parent and the Company. Each of Parent and the Company further agrees that,
if it shall become aware prior to the Effective Date of any information
furnished by it that would cause any of the statements in the Proxy Statement
or the Registration Statement to be false or misleading with respect to
any material fact, or to omit to state any material fact necessary to make
the statements therein not false or misleading, to promptly inform the other
party thereof and to take the necessary steps to correct the Proxy Statement
or the Registration Statement.   

(c) Parent agrees to advise the Company, promptly after Parent receives notice
thereof, of the time when the Registration Statement has become effective or
any supplement or amendment has been filed, of the issuance of any stop order
or the suspension of the qualification of Parent Common Stock for offering or
sale in any jurisdiction, of the initiation or threat of any proceeding
for any such purpose, or of any request by the SEC for the amendment or
supplement of the Registration Statement or for additional information.   

5.4 _Press Releases_. Parent and the Company shall consult with each other
before issuing any press release with respect to the Merger or this Plan and
shall not issue any such press release or make any such public statement
without the prior consent of the other party, which shall not be unreasonably
withheld; _provided_ , _however_ , that a party may, without the prior
consent of the other party (but after prior consultation, to the extent
practicable in the circumstances) issue such press release or make such
public statement as may upon the advice of counsel be required by law or the
rules and regulations of the NASDAQ Global Select Market or the NYSE, as
the case may be. Parent and the Company shall cooperate to develop all public
announcement materials and make appropriate management available at
presentations related to the transactions contemplated by this Plan as
reasonably requested by the other party.   

5.5 _Access; Information_.   

(a) Each of Parent and the Company agrees that upon reasonable notice and
subject to applicable laws relating to the exchange of information, it shall
afford the other party, and the other partys officers, employees, counsel,
accountants and other authorized representatives, such access during normal
business hours throughout the period prior to the Effective Time to the
books, records (including, without limitation, tax returns and work papers of
independent auditors), properties, personnel and to such other information as
any party may reasonably request and, during such period, it shall furnish
promptly to such other party (1) a copy of each material report, schedule and
other document filed by it pursuant to the requirements of federal or state
securities or banking laws , and (2) all other information concerning the
business, properties and personnel of it as the other may reasonably request;
_provided_ that the foregoing shall not require Parent or the Company (A) to
permit any inspection, or to disclose any information, that in the
reasonable judgment of Parent or the Company, as the case may be, would
result in disclosure of any trade secrets of third parties or violate any of
its obligations with respect to confidentiality if Parent or the Company, as
the case may be, shall have used reasonable efforts to obtain the consent of
such third party to such inspection or disclosure or (B) to disclose any
privileged information of Parent or the Company, as the case may be, or any
of its subsidiaries. All requests for information made pursuant to this
Section 5.5 shall be directed to an executive officer of Parent or the
Company, as the case may be, or such Person as may be designated by either of
their executive officers, as the case may be.   

(b) Each party agrees that it will not, and will cause its representatives not
to, use any information obtained pursuant to this Section 5.5 (as well as any
other information obtained prior to the date hereof in connection with the
entering into of this Plan) for any purpose unrelated to the consummation of
the transactions contemplated by this Plan. Subject to the requirements
of law, each party will keep confidential, and will cause its representatives
to keep confidential, all information and documents obtained pursuant to this
Section 5.5 (as well as any other information obtained prior to the date
hereof in connection with the entering into of this Plan) unless such
information (1) was already known to such party, (2) becomes available to such
party from other sources not known by such party to be bound by a
confidentiality obligation, (3) is disclosed with the prior written approval
of the providing party or (4) is or becomes readily ascertainable from
publicly available sources. If this Plan is terminated or the
transactions contemplated by this Plan shall otherwise fail to be
consummated, each party shall promptly cause all copies of documents or
extracts thereof containing information and data as to the other party to be
returned to the other party, except to the extent such action would be
inconsistent with applicable law, regulation, legal process, or the
applicable partys internal policies and procedures.   

(c) In addition to the confidentiality arrangements contained in this Plan,
all information provided or obtained in connection with the transactions
contemplated by this Plan (including pursuant to clause (a) above) will be
held by Parent or the Company, as the case may be in accordance with and
subject to the terms of the Confidentiality Agreement, dated May 15,
2007, between Parent and the Company (the " _Confidentiality Agreement_ ").
In the event of a conflict or inconsistency between the terms of this Plan
and the Confidentiality Agreement, the terms of this Plan will govern.   

5.6 _Acquisition Proposals_. (a) The Company agrees that after the date hereof
neither it nor any of its subsidiaries nor any of its respective officers and
directors or the officers and directors of any of its subsidiaries shall, and
it shall direct and use all reasonable best efforts to cause its employees
and agents, including any investment banker, attorney or accountant
retained by it or by any of its subsidiaries (collectively, its "
_Representatives_ ") not to, initiate, solicit or encourage, directly or
indirectly, any inquiries or the making or implementation of any Acquisition
Proposal, or, except to the extent that the board of directors of the
Company determines, in good faith, after consultation with its outside
financial and legal advisors, that such action is required in order for the
board of directors of the Company to comply with its fiduciary duties, engage
in any negotiations concerning, or provide any confidential information
or data to, or have any discussions with, any Person relating to an
Acquisition Proposal or otherwise facilitate any effort or attempt to
implement or make an Acquisition Proposal (and in any event, the Company
shall not provide any confidential information or data to any Person in
connection with an Acquisition Proposal unless such Person shall have
executed a confidentiality agreement on terms at least as favorable as those
contained in the Confidentiality Agreement). " _Acquisition Proposal_ " means
any proposal or offer with respect to the following involving the Company or
any of its Significant Subsidiaries: (1) any merger, consolidation, share
exchange, business combination or other similar transaction; (2) any sale,
lease, exchange, pledge, transfer or other disposition of 25% or more of its
consolidated assets or liabilities in a single transaction or series
of transactions; (3) any tender offer or exchange offer for, or other
acquisition of, 25% or more of the outstanding shares of its capital stock;
or (4) any public announcement of a proposal, plan or intention to do any of
the foregoing or any agreement to engage in any of the foregoing, other
than the Merger provided for in this Plan.. Notwithstanding anything in this
Plan to the contrary, the Company shall (i) promptly (but in no event later
than 24 hours) advise Parent, orally and in writing, of (x) the receipt by it
(or any of the other persons referred to above) of any Acquisition Proposal,
or any inquiry which could reasonably be expected to lead to an
Acquisition Proposal, or any material modification of or material amendment
to any Acquisition Proposal, or any request for nonpublic information
relating to the Company or any of its subsidiaries or for access to the
properties, books or records of the Company or any subsidiary by any Person or
entity that informs the board of directors of the Company or any subsidiary
that it is considering making, or has made, an Acquisition Proposal, (y) the
material terms and conditions of such proposal or inquiry (whether written or
oral) or modification or amendment to an Acquisition Proposal, and (z) the
identity of the person making any such proposal or inquiry and (ii) keep
Parent fully informed of the status and details of any such proposal or
inquiry and any developments with respect thereto. The Company shall use its
reasonable best efforts to enforce any existing confidentiality or standstill
agreements in accordance with the terms thereof, and shall immediately take
all steps necessary to terminate any approval that may have been heretofore
given under any such provisions authorizing any Person to make an Acquisition
Proposal. " _Significant Subsidiary"_ has the meaning ascribed to that term
in Rule 1-02 of Regulation S-X under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as
amended (the " _Exchange Act"_ ).   

(b) The Company and its subsidiaries shall immediately cease and cause to be
terminated any existing discussions or negotiations with any Persons (other
than Parent) conducted heretofore with respect to any of the foregoing, and
shall use reasonable best efforts to cause all Persons other than Parent who
have been furnished confidential information regarding the Company or
its subsidiaries in connection with the solicitation of or discussions
regarding an Acquisition Proposal within the 12 months prior to the date
hereof promptly to return or destroy such information. Neither the Company
nor the board of directors of the Company shall approve or take any action to
render inapplicable to any Acquisition Proposal any applicable Takeover Laws
or Takeover Provisions.   

5.7 _Affiliate Agreements_. The Company shall use its reasonable best efforts
to cause each director, executive officer and other person who is an
"affiliate" (for purposes of Rule 145 under the Securities Act) of the
Company to deliver to Parent, as soon as practicable after the date of this
Plan, a written agreement in the form Previously Disclosed.   

5.8 _Takeover Laws and Provisions_. No party hereto shall take any action that
would cause the transactions contemplated by this Plan to be subject to
requirements imposed by any Takeover Law and each of them shall take all
necessary steps within its control to exempt (or ensure the continued
exemption of) the transactions contemplated by this Plan from, or if
necessary challenge the validity or applicability of, any applicable Takeover
Law, as now or hereafter in effect. No party hereto shall take any action
that would cause the transactions contemplated by this Plan not to comply
with any Takeover Provisions and each of them shall take all necessary steps
within its control to make the transactions contemplated by this Plan comply
with (or continue to comply with) the Takeover Provisions.   

5.9 _Regulatory Applications_.   

(a) Parent and the Company shall cooperate and use their respective reasonable
best efforts to prepare as promptly as possible all documentation, to effect
all filings and to obtain all permits, consents, approvals and authorizations
of all third parties and Governmental Entities necessary to consummate the
transactions contemplated by this Plan, and Parent shall make all
necessary regulatory filings within 20 days of the date hereof. Each of
Parent and the Company shall have the right to review in advance, and to the
extent practicable each will consult with the other, in each case subject to
applicable laws relating to the exchange of information, with respect to
all material written information submitted to any third party or any
Governmental Entity in connection with the transactions contemplated by this
Plan. In exercising the foregoing right, each of the parties hereto agrees to
act reasonably and as promptly as practicable. Each party hereto agrees that
it will consult with the other party hereto with respect to the obtaining of
all material permits, consents, approvals and authorizations (collectively, "
_Approvals_ ") of all third parties and Governmental Entities necessary or
advisable to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Plan and each
party will keep the other party appraised of the status of material
matters relating to such Approvals and completion of the transactions
contemplated hereby. Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing contained herein
shall be deemed to require Parent to take any action, or commit to take any
action, or agree to any condition or restriction, in connection with
obtaining the foregoing permits, consents, approvals and authorizations, that
would reasonably be expected to have a material adverse effect (measured on a
scale relative to the Company and its subsidiaries taken as a whole) on
Parent, the Company or the Surviving Corporation (a " _Materially
Burdensome Regulatory Condition_ ").   

(b) Each party agrees, upon request, to furnish the other party with all
information concerning itself, its subsidiaries, directors, officers and
shareholders and such other matters as may be reasonably necessary or
advisable in connection with any filing, notice or application made by or on
behalf of such other party or any of its subsidiaries with or to any third
party or Governmental Entity.   

5.10 _Options_.   

(a) _Treatment of Options_. At the Effective Time, each option granted by the
Company to purchase shares of Company Common Stock that is outstanding and
unexercised under any employee stock option or equity compensation plan or
arrangement of the Company (any such option to purchase Company Common Stock
being referred to as a " _Company Option_ " or the " _Company Options_ "),
whether or not vested or exercisable, shall be converted at the Effective
Time into an option to purchase a number of shares of Parent Common Stock (a
" _Parent Option_ ") equal to the product (rounded down to the nearest whole
share) of (x) the number of shares of Company Common Stock subject to the
Company Option immediately prior to the Effective Time and (y) the Per Share
Stock Consideration, at an exercise price per share of Parent Common Stock
(rounded up to the nearest whole cent) subject to the Parent Option equal to
the quotient obtained by dividing (x) the exercise price per share of Company
Common Stock subject to the Company Option immediately prior to the Effective
Time by (y) the Per Share Stock Consideration. As of the Effective Time,
Parent shall assume such Company Options and the plans under which they have
been issued. With respect to any Company Options that are "incentive stock
options" (as defined in Section 422(b) of the Internal Revenue Code),
the foregoing adjustments shall be effected in a manner consistent with
Section 424(a) of the Internal Revenue Code. Prior to the Effective Time, the
board of directors of the Company shall take all action necessary or
appropriate to effectuate the foregoing.   

(b) _Actions._ Prior to the Effective Time, the Company may, after
consultation with Parent, take any actions it determines are warranted (but
without expenditure of any funds) to give effect to the transactions
contemplated by Section 5.10(a).   

5.11 _Indemnification and Insurance_.   

(a) Following the Effective Time, Parent shall indemnify, defend and hold
harmless and advance expenses to the present and former directors and
officers of the Company or any of its subsidiaries (including all of its
banking subsidiaries), and any such person presently or formerly serving
at the request of the Company or any of its subsidiaries as a director,
officer, employee, agent, trustee or fiduciary of another corporation,
partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise or under or with
respect to any employee benefit plan (each, an " _Indemnified Party_ "
and collectively, the " _Indemnified Parties_ ") against all costs or
expenses (including reasonable attorneys fees), judgments, fines, losses,
claims, damages, penalties, amounts paid in settlement or other liabilities
(collectively, " _Indemnified Liabilities_ ") incurred in connection with
any claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation, whether civil,
criminal, administrative or investigative, arising out of actions or
omissions occurring at or prior to the Effective Time (including the
transactions contemplated by this Plan), whether asserted or claimed prior to,
at or after the Effective Time (x) to the same extent as such persons are
indemnified or have the right to advancement of expenses pursuant to the
Governing Documents and indemnification agreements, if any, in effect on the
date of this Plan with the Company or any of its subsidiaries and, in
the case of the directors and executive officers of the Company (y) without
limitation of, and in addition to, clause (x), to the fullest extent
permitted by law. In the event of any such Indemnified Liabilities, (i)
Parent shall pay the reasonable fees and expenses of counsel selected by an
Indemnified Party promptly after statements therefor are received and shall
otherwise advance to such Indemnified Party upon request reimbursement of
documented expenses reasonably incurred and (ii) Parent and the applicable
Indemnified Parties shall cooperate in the defense of such matter. If any
Indemnified Party is required to bring any action to enforce rights or to
collect moneys due under this Plan and is successful in obtaining a decision
that it is entitled to enforcement of any right or collection of any money in
such action, Parent shall reimburse such Indemnified Party for all of its
expenses reasonably incurred in connection with bringing and pursuing such
action including, without limitation, reasonable attorneys fees and
costs.   

(b) For a period of six years from the Effective Time, Parent shall use its
reasonable best efforts to provide directors and officers liability
insurance (including excess coverage) and fiduciary liability insurance in
respect of any Company Benefit Plans that serves to reimburse the present and
former officers and directors of the Company or any of its subsidiaries
(including all of its banking subsidiaries) with respect to claims against
such directors and officers arising from facts or events occurring at or
prior to the Effective Time (including, without limitation, the transactions
contemplated by this Plan) which insurance shall contain at least the
same coverage and amounts, and contain terms and conditions no less
advantageous, as that coverage currently provided by the Company, _provided_
that in no event shall Parent be required to expend annually in the aggregate
an amount in excess of 250% of the annual premiums currently paid by
the Company (which current amount has been Previously Disclosed) for such
insurance (the " _Insurance Amount_ "), and _provided further_ that if Parent
is unable to maintain such policy (or such substitute policy) as a result of
the preceding proviso, Parent shall obtain as much comparable insurance as is
available for the Insurance Amount.   

(c) Any Indemnified Party wishing to claim indemnification under Section
5.11(a), upon learning of any claim, action, suit, proceeding or
investigation described above, shall notify Parent thereof; _provided_ that
the failure to so notify shall not affect the obligations of Parent under
Section 5.11(a) unless and to the extent that Parent is actually and
materially prejudiced as a result of such failure. Parent hereby acknowledges
notice of all matters Previously Disclosed.   

(d) If Parent or any of its successors or assigns shall consolidate with or
merge into any other entity and shall not be the continuing or surviving
entity of such consolidation or merger or shall transfer all or substantially
all of its assets or deposits to any other entity, or engage in any similar
transaction, then and in each case, Parent shall cause proper provision to be
made so that the successors and assigns of Parent shall assume the
obligations set forth in this Section 5.11.   

(e) The provisions of this Section 5.11 are intended to be for the benefit of,
and shall be enforceable by, each Indemnified Party and his or her heirs and
representatives. The indemnification rights granted in this Section 5.11 are
in addition to, and not in substitution for, any other rights to
indemnification or contribution that any Indemnified Party may have
by contract or otherwise.   

5.12 _Benefit Plans_. (a) Parent shall from and after the Effective Time,
assume and comply with the Benefit Plans and Parent agrees to honor and
perform the Companys and its subsidiaries obligations under such plans and
agreements in accordance with their terms. Parent shall provide the employees
of the Company and its subsidiaries with (A) benefits under employee benefit
plans that are no less favorable in the aggregate than those provided by the
Company and its subsidiaries on the date hereof, provided that for this
purpose benefits under employee benefit plans of Parent shall be deemed to be
no less favorable in the aggregate than those provided by the Company and its
subsidiaries on the date hereof and (B) until the first anniversary of
the Effective Time, severance benefits on a person-by-person basis that are
equal to the better of either (x) the severance benefits provided under the
Companys Corporate Severance Package Merger and Acquisition Related
Downsizing or (y) the severance benefits provided by Parent from time
to time. In the case of clause (y), any such severance benefits shall be
provided pursuant to the terms and conditions of Parents Displaced Employee
Assistance Plan, and in the case of clause (x), any such severance benefits
shall be subject to the employees execution and non-revocation of a release
and, to the extent that Parent consults with the Chief Executive Officer of
the Company about such terms and conditions, such benefits shall be provided
pursuant to the procedures and administrative terms and conditions of
Parents Displaced Employee Assistance Plan. For purposes of clarity,
severance benefits shall be provided under either clause (x) or (y) and there
shall not be any combination thereof. In addition Parent shall (1) provide
employees of the Company and its subsidiaries credit for all years of service
with the Company or any of its subsidiaries and their predecessors prior to
the Effective Time for the purpose of eligibility, vesting and
benefit accruals (other than benefit accruals under a defined benefit pension
plan and as would result in duplication of benefits), (2) cause any and all
pre-existing condition limitations (to the extent such limitations did not
apply to a pre-existing condition under comparable Benefit Plans)
and eligibility waiting periods under group health plans of Parent to be
waived with respect to employees of the Company and its subsidiaries who
remain as employees of Parent or its subsidiaries (and their eligible
dependents) and (3) cause to be credited any deductibles or out-of-
pocket expenses incurred by employees of the Company and its subsidiaries and
their beneficiaries and dependents during the portion of the calendar year
prior to their participation in Parents health plans with the objective that
there be no double counting during the year in which the Closing Date occurs
of such deductibles or out-of-pocket expenses. Parent and the Company agree to
honor, or to cause to be honored, in accordance with their terms, all vested
or accrued benefit obligations to, and contractual rights of, current and
former employees of the Company and its subsidiaries, including, without
limitation, any benefits or rights arising as a result of the
transactions contemplated by this Plan (either alone or in combination with
any other event); it being understood and agreed by the parties hereto that
the transactions contemplated by this Plan shall constitute a "change in
control" of the Company for purposes of the Benefit Plans that have
been Previously Disclosed.   

(b) This Section 5.12 shall inure exclusively to the benefit of and be binding
upon the parties hereto and their respective successors, assigns, executors
and legal representatives. Without limiting the generality of Section 8.13,
nothing in this Section 5.12, express or implied: (i) is intended to confer
on any person other than the parties hereto or their respective successors
and assigns any rights, remedies, obligations or liabilities under or by
reason of this Plan; (ii) shall require the Parent to maintain any specific
Benefit Plan or to guarantee employment of any employee for any period of
time after the Effective Time; and (iii) shall constitute an amendment to any
Benefit Plan or any Parent compensation or benefit plan or arrangement.   

5.13 _Notification of Certain Matters_. Each of Parent and the Company shall
give prompt notice to the other of any fact, event or circumstance known to
it that (1) is reasonably likely, individually or taken together with all
other facts, events and circumstances known to it, to result in any Material
Adverse Effect with respect to it or (2) would cause or constitute a material
breach of any of its representations, covenants or agreements contained
herein.   

5.14 _Exemption from Liability Under Section 16(b)_. Parent and the Company
agree that, in order to most effectively compensate and retain the Company
Insiders (as defined below) in connection with the Merger, both prior to and
after the Effective Time, it is desirable that the Company Insiders not be
subject to a risk of liability under Section 16(b) of the Exchange Act to the
fullest extent permitted by applicable law. Assuming that the Company delivers
to Parent the Company Section 16 Information (as defined below) in a timely
fashion prior to the Effective Time, the board of directors of Parent, or a
committee of non-employee directors thereof (as such term is defined for
purposes of Rule 16b-3(d) under the Exchange Act), shall reasonably promptly
thereafter and in any event prior to the Effective Time adopt a resolution
providing in substance that the receipt by the Company Insiders (as defined
below) of Parent Common Stock in exchange for shares of Company Common Stock
pursuant to the transactions contemplated hereby and to the extent
such securities are listed in the Company Section 16 Information, are
intended to be exempt from liability pursuant to Section 16(b) under the
Exchange Act to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law. " _Company
Section 16 Information_" shall mean information accurate in all
material respects regarding the Company Insiders, the number of shares of
Company Common Stock held by each such Company Insider and expected to be
exchanged for Parent Common Stock in the Merger, and the number and
description of the options to purchase shares of Company Common Stock held by
each such Company Insider and expected to be converted into options to
purchase shares of Parent Common Stock in connection with the Merger;
_provided_ that the requirement for a description of any Company Options
shall be deemed to be satisfied if copies of all plans, and forms of
agreements, under which such Options have been granted have been made
available to Parent. " _Company Insiders_ " shall mean those present or
former officers and directors of the Company who are subject to the
reporting requirements of Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act and who are
listed in the Company Section 16 Information.   

5.15 _Assumption by Parent of Indenture Obligations_. As of the Effective
Time, Parent shall assume expressly by supplemental indenture the obligations
of the Company under (i) the Indenture, dated as of March 22, 2007, (ii) the
Indenture, dated as of February 28, 2005, (iii) the Indenture, dated as of
December 4, 2004, and (iv) the Indenture, dated as of June 26, 2003, each
as more specifically identified on Section 5.15 of the Disclosure Schedule,
and Parent agrees to honor and perform the Companys obligations under such
indentures in accordance with their terms.   

5.16 _Credit Agreement_. Not later than thirty days after the date hereof,
in connection with that certain Credit Agreement described more fully on
Schedule 5.16, Parent and the Company shall execute an agreement in the form
described therein providing that on the Closing Date the obligations under
that agreement will be satisfied as described therein.   

5.17 _Other Actions_. As promptly as practicable after the date hereof, but in
any event prior to Closing, (a) the Company shall complete the restatement of
its financial statements and the review of its Equipment Finance, LLC loan
portfolio currently in process and (b) the Company shall use its reasonable
best efforts to facilitate the completion by Stradley Ronon Stevens and Young,
LLP of its investigation and its report thereof to the audit committee of
the board of directors of the Company.   

5.18 _Additional Actions_. Schedule 5.18 is incorporated herein by
reference.

(c) if the approval of the Companys shareholders required by Section 6.1(a)

(e) if (1) the board of directors of the Company has failed to recommend that

after the approval by shareholders of the Company referred to in Section
6.1(a), by action of the board of directors of the Company:   

(a) if the Merger shall not have been consummated by the Termination Date;
_provided_ that the right to terminate this Plan pursuant to this clause (a)

be consummated;   

(b) if the approval of the Companys shareholders required by Section 6.1(a)

is not cured within 30 days after written notice thereof is given by the
Company to Parent.   

7.4 _Effect of Termination and Abandonment_. In the event of termination of
this Plan and the abandonment of the Merger pursuant to this Article VII,
this Plan (other than as set forth in Sections 5.5(b) and (c), 7.5 and 8.10)
shall become void and of no effect with no liability on the part of any party
hereto (or of any of its directors, officers, employees, agents, legal
and financial advisors or other representatives); _provided_ , _however_ , no
such termination shall relieve any party hereto of any liability or damages
resulting from any willful breach of this Plan.   

7.5 _Termination Fee._    

(a) In the event that (1) a Company Pre-Termination Takeover Proposal Event
(as hereinafter defined) shall occur after the date of this Plan and
thereafter this Plan is terminated by either Parent or the Company pursuant
to Section 7.2(c) or 7.3(b), respectively, by Parent pursuant to Section
7.2(e)(1) or (2), or by Parent pursuant to Section 7.2(a) as a result of a
willful breach by the Company, and (2) prior to the date that is twelve (12)
months after the date of such termination the Company consummates an
Acquisition Proposal or enters into any acquisition or other similar
agreement, including any letter of intent, related to any Acquisition Proposal
(each, a " _Company Acquisition Agreement_ "), then the Company shall, (x) on
the date such Company Acquisition Agreement is entered into, pay Parent a fee
equal to $7,000,000 by wire transfer of same day funds and (y) on the date an
Acquisition Proposal is consummated (if consummated within one year of
the date of termination, or if consummated at any time (without regard to
such one-year period) if the Acquisition Proposal is the Acquisition Proposal
relating to the Company Acquisition Agreement addressed in the preceding
clause (x)), pay Parent a fee equal to $21,000,000 by wire transfer of same
day funds, less any fee paid pursuant to the preceding clause (x).   

(b) In the event that this Plan is terminated by Parent pursuant to Section
7.2(e)(3), then the Company shall, (1) on the date of such termination, pay
Parent a fee equal to $7,000,000 by wire transfer of same day funds and (2)
on the date the Company consummates an Acquisition Proposal (if consummated
within one year of the date of termination, or at any time if the
Acquisition Proposal is the Acquisition Proposal that resulted in such
termination), pay Parent a fee equal to $14,000,000 by wire transfer of same
day funds.   

(c) For purposes of this Section 7.5, a " _Pre-Termination Takeover Proposal
Event_ " shall be deemed to occur if, prior to the event giving rise to the
right to terminate this Plan, a bona fide Acquisition Proposal shall have
been made known to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or has been made
directly to its shareholders generally or any Person shall have publicly
announced an intention (whether or not conditional) to make an Acquisition
Proposal.   

(d) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, the maximum aggregate
amount of fees payable under this Section 7.5 shall be $21,000,000.   

(e) The Company acknowledges that the agreements contained in this Section 7.5
are an integral part of the transactions contemplated by this Plan, and that,
without these agreements, Parent would not enter into this Plan; accordingly,
if the Company fails promptly to pay the amount due pursuant to this Section
7.5, and, in order to obtain such payment, Parent commences a suit
which results in a judgment against the Company for the fee set forth in this
Section 7.5, the Company shall pay to Parent its costs and expenses
(including attorneys fees and expenses) in connection with such suit,
together with interest on the amount of the fee at the rate on six-month
U.S. Treasury obligations plus 300 basis points in effect on the date such
payment was required to be made.

8.7 _Entire Agreement, Etc._ This Plan (including the Disclosure Schedules)
and the Confidentiality Agreement constitute the entire agreement, and
supersedes all other prior agreements, understandings, representations, both
written and oral, between the parties, with respect to the subject matter
hereof, and this Plan shall not be assignable by operation of law
or otherwise (any attempted assignment in contravention of this Section 8.7
being null and void).   

8.8 _Definition of "subsidiary" and "affiliate"; Covenants with Respect to
Subsidiaries and Affiliates_. (a) When a reference is made in this Plan to a
subsidiary of a Person, the term " _subsidiary_ " has the meaning ascribed to
that term in Rule 1-02 of Registration S-X under the Exchange Act. When a
reference is made in this Plan to an affiliate of a Person, the
term "affiliate" (or " _Affiliate_ ") means those other Persons that,
directly or indirectly, control, are controlled by, or are under common
control with, such Person.   

(b) Insofar as any provision of this Plan shall require a subsidiary or an
affiliate of a party to take or omit to take any action, such provision shall
be deemed a covenant by Parent or the Company, as the case may be, to cause
such action or omission to occur.   

8.9 _Specific Performance_. The parties hereto agree that if any of the
provisions of this Plan were not performed in accordance with their specific
terms or were otherwise breached, irreparable damage would occur, no adequate
remedy at law would exist and damages would be difficult to determine, and
that the parties will be entitled to specific performance of the
terms hereof, in addition to any other remedy at law or equity.   

8.10 _Expenses_. Each party will bear all expenses incurred by it in
connection with this Plan and the transactions contemplated hereby, except
that Parent and Company will each bear and pay one-half of the costs
(excluding the fees and disbursements of counsel, financial advisors and
accountants) incurred in connection with the copying, printing and
distributing of the Registration Statement and the Proxy Statement for the
approval of the Merger.   

8.11 _Interpretation; Effect_.   

(a) In this Plan, except as context may otherwise require, references:   

(1) to the Preamble, Recitals, Sections, Annexes or Schedules are to the
Preamble to, a Recital or Section of, or Annex or Schedule to, this
Plan;

as a whole;   

(3) to the "transactions contemplated hereby" includes the transactions
provided for in this Plan including the Merger;   

(4) to any agreement (including this Plan), contract, statute or regulation

supplemented, restated or replaced from time to time (in the case of an
agreement or contract, to the extent permitted by the terms thereof); and to
any section of any statute or regulation include any successor to the section;
and   

(5) to any Governmental Entity includes any successor to that Governmental
Entity.   

(b) The words "hereby", "herein", "hereof", "hereunder" and similar terms are
to be deemed to refer to this Plan as a whole and not to any specific
Section.   

(c) The words "include", "includes" or "including" are to be deemed followed
by the words "without limitation".   

(d) The word "party" is to be deemed to refer to the Company or Parent.   

(e) The word "person" is to be interpreted broadly to include any individual,
savings association, bank, trust company, corporation, limited liability
company, partnership, association, joint-stock company, business trust or
unincorporated organization.   

(f) The table of contents and article and section headings are for reference
purposes only and do not limit or otherwise affect any of the substance of
this Plan.   

(g) This Plan is the product of negotiation by the parties, having the
assistance of counsel and other advisers. The parties intend that this Plan
not be construed more strictly with regard to one party than with regard to
the other.   

(h) The disclosure in any Section of a Disclosure Schedule shall apply only to
the indicated section of this Plan except to the extent that it is reasonably
apparent that such disclosure is relevant to another section of this
Plan.   

8.12 _Severability_. The provisions of this Plan shall be deemed severable and
the invalidity or unenforceability of any provision shall not affect the
validity or enforceability of the other provisions hereof. If any provision
of this Plan, or the application thereof to any Person or entity or any
circumstance, is found by a court or other Governmental Entity of
competent jurisdiction to be invalid or unenforceable, (a) a suitable and
equitable provision shall be substituted therefor in order to carry out, so
far as may be valid and enforceable, the intent and purpose of such invalid
or unenforceable provision and (b) the remainder of this Plan and
the application of such provision to other Persons, entities or circumstances
shall not be affected by such invalidity or unenforceability, nor shall such
invalidity or unenforceability affect the validity or enforceability of such
provision, or the application thereof, in any other jurisdiction.   

8.13 _No Third Party Beneficiaries_. Nothing contained in this Plan, expressed
or implied, is intended to confer upon any Person, other than the parties
hereto, any benefit, right or remedies except that the provisions of Sections
5.11 and 5.14 shall inure to the benefit of the Persons referred to
therein.   

8.14 _Waiver of Jury Trial_. Each party hereto acknowledges and agrees that
any controversy which may arise under this Plan is likely to involve
complicated and difficult issues, and therefore each party hereby irrevocably
and unconditionally waives any right such party may have to a trial by jury
in respect of any litigation, directly or indirectly, arising out of,
or relating to, this Plan, or the transactions contemplated by this Plan.
Each party certifies and acknowledges that (a) no representative, agent or
attorney of any other party has represented, expressly or otherwise, that
such other party would not, in the event of litigation, seek to enforce the
foregoing waiver, (b) each party understands and has considered the
implications of this waiver, (c) each party makes this waiver voluntarily,
and (d) each party has been induced to enter into this Plan by, among other
things, the mutual waivers and certifications in this Section 8.14.   

8.15 _Submission to Jurisdiction; Selection of Forum_. Each party hereto
agrees that it shall bring any action or proceeding in respect of any claim
arising out of or related to this Plan or the Merger exclusively in any
United States District Court located in Pennsylvania or any Pennsylvania
State court (the " _Chosen Courts_ "), and solely in connection with claims
arising under this Plan or the Merger that are the subject of this Plan (a)
irrevocably submits to the exclusive jurisdiction of the Chosen Courts, (b)
waives any objection to laying venue in any such action or proceeding in the
Chosen Courts, (c) waives any objection that the Chosen Courts are
an inconvenient forum or do not have jurisdiction over any party hereto and
(d) agrees that service of process upon such party in any such action or
proceeding shall be effective if notice is given in accordance with Section
8.6 of this Plan.
