<P align="left" style="font-size: 10.5pt; text-indent: 8%">2.1 <U>Conversion or Cancellation of Shares</U>. At the Effective Time, by virtue of the
Merger and without any action on the part of any shareholder:


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10.5pt; text-indent: 8%">(a)&nbsp;<I>Company Common Stock</I>. Each share of Company Common Stock issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time, other than Exception Shares (as hereinafter defined),
shall be converted into the right to receive, at the election of each holder thereof, but subject
to the election and allocation procedures of Sections&nbsp;2.1(d) and (e), the other provisions of this
Section&nbsp;2.1 and possible adjustment as set forth in Section&nbsp;2.4, either:


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10.5pt; text-indent: 13%">(1)&nbsp;that number of fully paid and nonassessable shares of Parent Common Stock equal to the
result obtained by dividing the Per Share Consideration by the Parent Share Price (the &#147;<I>Per Share
Stock Consideration</I>&#148;), or


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10.5pt; text-indent: 13%">(2)&nbsp;an amount in cash, without interest, equal to the Per Share Consideration (the &#147;<I>Per Share
Cash Consideration</I>&#148; and, together with the Per Share Stock Consideration, the &#147;<I>Consideration</I>&#148;).


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10.5pt; text-indent: 8%">(b)&nbsp;<I>Parent Common Stock</I>. Each share of Parent Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to
the Effective Time shall remain outstanding as one share of common stock of the Surviving
Corporation.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10.5pt; text-indent: 8%">(c)&nbsp;<I>Cancellation of Old Shares</I>. Each share of Company Common Stock issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time, other than Exception Shares, is hereinafter defined as an
&#147;<I>Old Share</I>&#148;. Old Shares shall cease to be outstanding, shall be canceled and retired and shall
cease to exist, and each holder of a certificate (an &#147;<I>Old Certificate</I>&#148;) formerly representing Old
Shares shall thereafter cease to have any rights with respect to such shares, except the right to
receive, without interest, upon exchange of such Old Certificate in accordance with Section&nbsp;2.3,
the Consideration.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10.5pt; text-indent: 8%">(d)&nbsp;Subject to the allocation procedures set forth in Section&nbsp;2.1(e), each record holder of
Company Common Stock will be entitled (i)&nbsp;to elect to receive shares of Parent Common Stock (a
&#147;<I>Stock Election</I>&#148;) for all or some of the shares of Company Common Stock (&#147;<I>Stock Election Shares</I>&#148;)
held by such record holder, (ii)&nbsp;to elect to receive cash (a &#147;<I>Cash Election</I>&#148;) for all or some of

indicate that such holder makes no such election (a &#147;<I>No-Election</I>&#148;) for all or some of the shares
of Company Common Stock (&#147;<I>No-Election Shares</I>&#148;) held by such record holder. All such elections
(each, an &#147;<I>Election</I>&#148;) shall be made on a form designed for that purpose and agreed to by Parent and
the Company (an &#147;<I>Election Form</I>&#148;). Any shares of Company Common Stock for which the record holder
has not, as of the Election Deadline (as defined below), properly submitted to the Exchange Agent a
properly completed Election Form will be deemed No-Election Shares. A record holder acting in
different capacities or acting on behalf of other persons in any way will be entitled to submit an
Election Form for each capacity in which such record holder so acts with respect to each person for
which it so acts. The exchange agent (the &#147;<I>Exchange Agent</I>&#148;) will be a bank or trust company in the
United States selected by Parent and reasonably acceptable to the Company.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10.5pt; text-indent: 8%">(e)&nbsp;Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Plan, the allocation among the holders of
shares of Company Common Stock of rights to receive the Per Share Stock Consideration or the Per
Share Cash Consideration will be made as follows:


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10.5pt; text-indent: 13%">(1)&nbsp;<U>Number of Stock Elections Less Than the Stock Conversion Number</U>. If the aggregate
number of Stock Election Shares (on the basis of Election Forms received as of the Election
Deadline) is less than a number equal to the number of Exchangeable Shares minus the result
obtained by dividing (x)&nbsp;the product of the number of Exchangeable Shares and the Signing Cash
Amount by (y)&nbsp;the Per Share Consideration (the &#147;<I>Stock Conversion Number</I>&#148;), then



<P align="left" style="margin-left:4%; font-size: 10.5pt; text-indent: 4%">(A)&nbsp;each Stock Election Share will be, as of the Effective Time, converted into the
right to receive the Per Share Stock Consideration,



<P align="left" style="margin-left:4%; font-size: 10.5pt; text-indent: 4%">(B)&nbsp;the Exchange Agent will allocate from among the No-Election Shares, pro rata to
the holders of No-Election Shares in accordance with their respective numbers of
No-Election Shares, a sufficient number of No-Election Shares so that the sum of such
number and the number of Stock Election Shares equals as closely as practicable the Stock
Conversion Number, and each such allocated No-Election Share (each, a &#147;<I>Stock-Selected
No-Election Share</I>&#148;) will be, as of the Effective Time, converted into the right to receive
the Per Share Stock Consideration, <I>provided </I>that if the sum of all No-Election Shares and
Stock Election Shares is equal to or less than the Stock Conversion Number, all No-Election
Shares will be Stock-Selected No-Election Shares,



<P align="left" style="margin-left:4%; font-size: 10.5pt; text-indent: 4%">(C)&nbsp;if the sum of Stock Election Shares and No-Election Shares is less than the Stock
Conversion Number, the Exchange Agent will allocate from among the Cash Election Shares,
pro rata to the holders of Cash Election Shares in accordance with their respective numbers
of Cash Election Shares, a sufficient number of Cash Election Shares so that the sum of
such number, the number of all Stock Election Shares and the number of all No-Election
Shares equals as closely as practicable the Stock Conversion Number, and each such
allocated Cash Election Share (each, a &#147;<I>Converted Cash Election Share</I>&#148;) will be, as of the
Effective Time, converted into the right to receive the Per Share Stock Consideration, and



<P align="left" style="margin-left:4%; font-size: 10.5pt; text-indent: 4%">(D)&nbsp;each No-Election Share and Cash Election Share that is not a Stock-Selected
No-Election Share or a Converted Cash Election Share (as the case may be) will be, as of
the Effective Time, converted into the right to receive the Per Share Cash Consideration.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10.5pt; text-indent: 8%">(2)&nbsp;<U>Number of Stock Elections Greater Than the Stock Conversion Number</U>. If the
aggregate number of Stock Election Shares (on the basis of Election Forms received by the Election
Deadline) is greater than the Stock Conversion Number, then



<P align="left" style="margin-left:4%; font-size: 10.5pt; text-indent: 4%">(A)&nbsp;each Cash Election Share and No-Election Share will be, as of the Effective Time,
converted into the right to receive the Per Share Cash Consideration,



<P align="left" style="margin-left:4%; font-size: 10.5pt; text-indent: 4%">(B)&nbsp;the Exchange Agent will allocate from among the Stock Election Shares, pro rata to
the holders of Stock Election Shares in accordance with their respective numbers of Stock
Election Shares, a sufficient number of Stock Election Shares (&#147;<I>Converted Stock Election
Shares</I>&#148;) so that the difference of (x)&nbsp;the number of Stock Election Shares less (y)&nbsp;the
number of the Converted Stock Election Shares equals as closely as practicable the Stock
Conversion Number, and each Converted Stock Election Share will be, as of the Effective
Time, converted into the right to receive the Per Share Cash Consideration, and



<P align="left" style="margin-left:4%; font-size: 10.5pt; text-indent: 4%">(C)&nbsp;each Stock Election Share that is not a Converted Stock Election Share will be, as
of the Effective Time, converted into the right to receive the Per Share Stock
Consideration.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10.5pt; text-indent: 8%">(3)&nbsp;<U>Number of Stock Elections is Equal to the Stock Conversion Number</U>. If the
aggregate number of Stock Election Shares (on the basis of Election Forms received by the Election
Deadline) is equal to the Stock Conversion Number, then



<P align="left" style="margin-left:4%; font-size: 10.5pt; text-indent: 4%">(A)&nbsp;each Stock Election Share will be, as of the Effective Time, converted into the
right to receive the Per Share Stock Consideration, and



<P align="left" style="margin-left:4%; font-size: 10.5pt; text-indent: 4%">(B)&nbsp;each Cash Election Share and No-Election Share will be, as of the Effective Time,
converted into the right to receive the Per Share Cash Consideration.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10.5pt; text-indent: 8%">(f)&nbsp;<U>Certain Definitions</U>.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10.5pt; text-indent: 13%">(1)&nbsp;&#147;<I>Parent Share Price</I>&#148; means the arithmetic average of the last reported per share sales
prices of Parent Common Stock on the New York Stock Exchange (the &#147;<I>NYSE</I>&#148;), as reported in the New
York City edition of <I>The Wall Street Journal </I>or, if not reported therein, another authoritative
source mutually agreed to by Parent and the Company, for each of the five full consecutive trading
days ending on the trading day immediately prior to the Closing Date.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10.5pt; text-indent: 13%">(2)&nbsp;&#147;<I>Exchangeable Shares</I>&#148; means the aggregate number of shares of Company Common Stock issued
and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time, excluding Exception Shares, rounded to the
nearest whole share.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10.5pt; text-indent: 13%">(3)&nbsp;&#147;<I>Per Share Consideration</I>&#148; means the sum, rounded to the nearest whole cent, of (a)&nbsp;$7.60
(the &#147;<I>Signing Cash Amount</I>&#148;) <I>plus </I>(b)&nbsp;the product, rounded to the nearest one ten-thousandth, of
0.1543 (such number being the &#147;<I>Signing Exchange Ratio</I>&#148;) and the Parent Share Price.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10.5pt; text-indent: 8%">(g)&nbsp;<U>Exception Shares</U>. At the Effective Time, (1)&nbsp;each Exception Share owned by Parent
or the Company shall be cancelled and retired and shall cease to exist and no consideration shall
be delivered in exchange therefor, and (2)&nbsp;each Exception Share held by any direct or indirect
wholly owned subsidiary of Parent or the Company shall be converted into the right to receive the
Per Share Stock Consideration. The Per Share Stock Consideration payable pursuant to this Section
2.1(g) shall not be subject to, and will not be deemed to be Stock Election Shares or otherwise
taken into account in calculating, adjustments under Section&nbsp;2.1(e). &#147;<I>Exception Share</I>&#148; means a
share of Company Common Stock owned or held, other than in a bona fide fiduciary or agency capacity
or in satisfaction of a debt previously contracted in good faith, by Parent, the Company or a
subsidiary of either.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10.5pt; text-indent: 8%">2.2 <U>Fractional Shares</U>. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Article&nbsp;II, no
fractional shares of Parent Common Stock will be issued pursuant to the Merger. Instead, Parent
will pay or cause to be paid to the holder of any Old Shares that would, pursuant to paragraph&nbsp;2.1,
otherwise be entitled to receive fractional shares of Parent Common Stock an amount in cash,
rounded to the nearest cent and without interest, equal to the product of (i)&nbsp;the fraction of a
share to which such holder would otherwise have been entitled and (ii)&nbsp;the Measurement Price. As
used in this Plan, the term &#147;<I>Measurement Price</I>&#148; means the average of the daily high and low per

in the New York City edition of <I>The Wall Street Journal </I>or, if not reported therein, in another
authoritative source mutually agreed by Parent and the Company, for the last trading day
immediately prior to the Closing Date.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10.5pt; text-indent: 8%">2.3 <U>Exchange of Old Certificates for New Certificates</U>.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10.5pt; text-indent: 8%">(a)&nbsp;<I>Exchange Agent. </I>At or before the Effective Time, Parent shall make available or cause to
be made available to the Exchange Agent certificates or, at Parent&#146;s option, evidence of shares in
book entry form (each, a &#147;<I>New Certificate</I>&#148;), representing the shares of Parent Common Stock (each,
a &#147;<I>New Share</I>&#148;) and cash in amounts sufficient to allow the Exchange Agent to make all deliveries of
New Certificates and payments that may be required in exchange for Old Certificates pursuant to
this Article&nbsp;II (collectively, the &#147;<I>Exchange Fund</I>&#148;). Any portion of the Exchange Fund that remains
unclaimed by the shareholders of the Company as of the first anniversary of the Effective Time may,
to the extent permitted by applicable law, be paid to Parent. In such event, any holder of Old
Certificates who has not theretofore exchanged his or her Old Certificates for New Certificates
and/or cash pursuant to this Article&nbsp;II shall thereafter be entitled to look exclusively to Parent,
and only as a general creditor thereof in the case of cash, for the shares of Parent Common Stock
and/or cash to which he or she may be entitled upon exchange of such Old Certificates pursuant to
this Article&nbsp;II, in each case, without any interest thereon. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
neither the Exchange Agent nor any party hereto, shall be liable to any holder of Old Certificates
for any amount properly delivered to a public official pursuant to applicable abandoned property,
escheat or similar laws.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10.5pt; text-indent: 8%">(b)&nbsp;<I>Exchange Procedures</I>.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10.5pt; text-indent: 13%">(1)&nbsp;Parent shall cause the Exchange Agent to provide the Form of Election to holders of record
of Company Common Stock (other than holders of Exception Shares), together with appropriate
transmittal materials, at the time of mailing of the Proxy Statement to the holders of record of
Company Common Stock, or on such other date as the Company and Parent shall mutually agree so as to
minimize the impact of limitations under applicable law relating to Parent share repurchases that
might apply with respect thereto, and thereafter from time to time as the Company may reasonably
request until three days prior to the Election Deadline, to each person who is a holder of record
of Company Common Stock for purposes of the Company Meeting. Elections shall be made by mailing to
the Exchange Agent a duly completed Form of Election. A Form of Election may specify which
specific shares covered thereby are subject to a Cash Election, a Stock Election or a No-Election.
To be effective, a Form of Election must be (1)&nbsp;properly completed, signed and submitted to the
Exchange Agent at its designated office, by 5:00&nbsp;p.m. local time (in the city in which the
principal office of the Exchange Agent is located) on the later of the day prior to the Company
Meeting and the date that the parties believe to be as near as practicable to five business days
prior to the anticipated Closing Date, taking into account PNC&#146;s intention to minimize the impact
of limitations under applicable law relating to Parent share repurchases that might apply (or such
other time and date as the Company and Parent may mutually agree) (the &#147;<I>Election Deadline</I>&#148;) and
(2)&nbsp;accompanied by the certificate(s) representing the shares of Company Common Stock as to which
the election is being made (or by an appropriate guarantee of delivery of such certificate(s) by a
commercial bank or trust company in the United States or a member of a registered national security
exchange or of the NASD, <I>provided </I>that such certificates are in fact delivered to the Exchange
Agent within three trading days after the date of execution of such guarantee of delivery; failure
to deliver shares of Company Common Stock covered by such a guarantee of delivery within the time
set forth on such guarantee shall be deemed to invalidate any otherwise properly made Election,
unless otherwise determined by Parent, in its sole discretion). Parent will determine, in its sole
and absolute discretion, which authority it may delegate in whole or in part to the Exchange Agent,
whether Forms of Election have been properly completed, signed and submitted or revoked. The
decision of Parent (or the Exchange Agent, as the case may be) in such matters shall be conclusive
and binding. Neither Parent nor the Exchange Agent will be under any obligation to notify any
person of any defect in a Form of Election submitted to the Exchange Agent. A holder of shares of
Company Common Stock that does not submit an effective Form of Election prior to the Election
Deadline shall be deemed to have made a No-Election. An election may be revoked, but only by
written notice received by the Exchange Agent prior to the Election Deadline. Any certificate(s)
representing shares of Company Common Stock that have been submitted to the Exchange Agent in
connection with an election shall be returned without charge to the holder thereof in the event
such election is revoked as aforesaid and such holder requests in writing the return of such
certificate(s). Upon any such revocation, unless a duly completed Form of Election is thereafter
submitted prior to the Election Deadline and otherwise in accordance with this Section, such shares
shall be deemed No-Election Shares. The Exchange Agent, in consultation with Parent and the
Company, will make all computations to give effect to this Section.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10.5pt; text-indent: 13%">(2)&nbsp;As promptly as reasonably practicable following the Effective Time, taking into account
the computations contemplated by Section&nbsp;2.1(e), each holder of record of Company Common Stock that
has surrendered the certificates representing its Company Common Stock will be entitled to receive
a New Certificate representing the shares of Parent Common Stock issuable in exchange therefor
and/or a check representing cash payable pursuant to this Article&nbsp;II. No interest will accrue or
be paid with respect to any New Certificates or cash to be delivered upon surrender of Old
Certificates. If any New Certificate is to be issued or cash is to be paid in a name other than
that in which the Old Certificate surrendered in exchange therefor is registered, it will be a
condition to the exchange that the person requesting the exchange (1)&nbsp;pay any transfer or other
Taxes required by reason of the issuance of the New Certificate or the making of the cash payment
in a name other than the name of the holder of the surrendered Old Certificate or (2)&nbsp;establish to
the satisfaction of Parent (or the Exchange Agent, as the case may be) that any such Taxes have
been paid or are not applicable.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10.5pt; text-indent: 13%">(3)&nbsp;As promptly as reasonably practicable following the Effective Time Parent shall cause the
Exchange Agent to mail or deliver to each person who was, immediately prior to the Effective Time,
a holder of record of Company Common Stock and who theretofore has not submitted such holder&#146;s Old
Certificates with an Election Form, a form of letter of transmittal (which shall specify that
delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to Old Certificates shall pass, only upon
proper delivery of such certificates to the Exchange Agent) containing instructions for use in
effecting the surrender of Old Certificates in exchange for the consideration to which such person
may be entitled pursuant to this Article&nbsp;II.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10.5pt; text-indent: 8%">(c)&nbsp;<I>Distributions with Respect to Unexchanged Shares</I>. No dividends or other distributions
with respect to Parent Common Stock having a record date after the Effective Time will be paid to
any holder of Company Common Stock until such holder has surrendered the Old Certificate
representing such stock as provided herein. Subject to the effect of applicable law, following
surrender of any such Old Certificates, there shall be paid to the holder of New Certificates
issued in exchange therefor, without interest, the amount of dividends or other distributions with
a record date after the Effective Time previously payable with respect to the shares of Parent
Common Stock represented thereby. To the extent permitted by law, holders of Company Common Stock
who receive Parent Common Stock in the Merger shall be entitled to vote after the Effective Time at
any meeting of Parent shareholders the number of whole shares of Parent Common Stock into which
their respective shares of Company Common Stock are converted, regardless of whether such holders
of Company Common Stock have exchanged their Old Certificates for New Certificates in accordance
with the provisions of this Plan, but beginning 30&nbsp;days after the Effective Time no such holder
shall be entitled to vote on any matter until such holder surrenders such Old Certificate for
exchange as provided in Section&nbsp;2.3(b)(1).


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10.5pt; text-indent: 8%">(d)&nbsp;<I>Transfers</I>. At or after the Effective Time, there shall be no transfers on the stock
transfer books of the Surviving Corporation of Old Shares.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10.5pt; text-indent: 8%">(e)&nbsp;<I>Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates</I>. If any Old Certificate shall have been lost,
stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the individual, bank,
corporation, partnership, trust, association or other entity or organization (any of the foregoing,
a &#147;<I>Person</I>&#148;) claiming such Old Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if required by the
Surviving Corporation or the Exchange Agent, the posting by such Person of a bond in such
reasonable amount as the Surviving Corporation or the Exchange Agent may direct as indemnity
against any claim that may be made against it with respect to such Old Certificate, the Surviving
Corporation or the Exchange Agent shall, in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Old
Certificate, issue or cause to be issued a New Certificate and pay or cause to be paid the amounts,
if any, deliverable in respect to the Old Shares formerly represented by such Old Certificate
pursuant to this Article&nbsp;II.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10.5pt; text-indent: 8%">2.4 <U>Adjustment of Consideration</U>. If Parent changes (or the board of directors of
Parent sets a related record date that will occur before the Effective Time for a change in) the
number or kind of shares of Parent Common Stock outstanding by way of a stock split, stock
dividend, recapitalization, reclassification, reorganization or similar transaction, the Signing
Exchange Ratio will be adjusted proportionately to account for such change.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10.5pt; text-indent: 8%">2.5 <U>Withholding Rights</U>. Each of Parent, the Surviving Corporation and the Exchange
Agent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the consideration otherwise payable to any

Confidentiality Agreement constitute the entire agreement, and supersedes all other prior
agreements, understandings, representations, both written and oral, between the parties, with
respect to the subject matter hereof, and this Plan shall not be assignable by operation of law or
otherwise (any&nbsp;attempted assignment in contravention of this Section&nbsp;8.7 being null and void).

&#147;<I>subsidiary</I>&#148; has the meaning ascribed to that term in Rule&nbsp;1-02 of Registration S-X under the
Exchange Act. When a reference is made in this Plan to an affiliate of a Person, the term
&#147;affiliate&#148; (or &#147;<I>Affiliate</I>&#148;) means those other Persons that, directly or indirectly, control, are
controlled by, or are under common control with, such Person.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10.5pt; text-indent: 8%">(b)&nbsp;Insofar as any provision of this Plan shall require a subsidiary or an affiliate of a

hereof, in addition to any other remedy at law or equity.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10.5pt; text-indent: 8%">8.10 <U>Expenses</U>. Each party will bear all expenses incurred by it in connection with
this Plan and the transactions contemplated hereby, except that Parent and Company will each bear
and pay one-half of the costs (excluding the fees and disbursements of counsel, financial advisors
and accountants) incurred in connection with the copying, printing and distributing of the
Registration Statement and the Proxy Statement for the approval of the Merger.

<P align="left" style="font-size: 10.5pt; text-indent: 8%">8.12 <U>Severability</U>. The provisions of this Plan shall be deemed severable and the
invalidity or unenforceability of any provision shall not affect the validity or enforceability of
the other provisions hereof. If any provision of this Plan, or the application thereof to any
Person or entity or any circumstance, is found by a court or other Governmental Entity of competent
jurisdiction to be invalid or unenforceable, (a)&nbsp;a suitable and equitable provision shall be
substituted therefor in order to carry out, so far as may be valid and enforceable, the intent and
purpose of such invalid or unenforceable provision and (b)&nbsp;the remainder of this Plan and the
application of such provision to other Persons, entities or circumstances shall not be affected by
such invalidity or unenforceability, nor shall such invalidity or unenforceability affect the
validity or enforceability of such provision, or the application thereof, in any other
jurisdiction.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10.5pt; text-indent: 8%">8.13 <U>No Third Party Beneficiaries</U>. Nothing contained in this Plan, expressed or

or remedies except that the provisions of Sections&nbsp;5.11 and 5.14 shall inure to the benefit of the
Persons referred to therein.

controversy which may arise under this Plan is likely to involve complicated and difficult issues,
and therefore each party hereby irrevocably and unconditionally waives any right such party may
have to a trial by jury in respect of any litigation, directly or indirectly, arising out of, or
relating to, this Plan, or the transactions contemplated by this Plan. Each party certifies and
acknowledges that (a)&nbsp;no representative, agent or attorney of any other party has represented,
expressly or otherwise, that such other party would not, in the event of litigation, seek to
enforce the foregoing waiver, (b)&nbsp;each party understands and has considered the implications of
this waiver, (c)&nbsp;each party makes this waiver voluntarily, and (d)&nbsp;each party has been induced to
enter into this Plan by, among other things, the mutual waivers and certifications in this
Section&nbsp;8.14.
