8 ARTICLE II __

_THE MERGER_

2.1 _The Merger_. Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth
herein and the applicable provisions of the DGCL, and on the basis of the
representations, warranties, covenants and agreements contained herein, as of
the Effective Time, the Merger Subsidiary shall be merged with and into the
Company (the " _Merger_ "), the separate corporate existence of the Merger
Subsidiary shall cease and the Company shall continue as the surviving
corporation. The Company, as the surviving corporation of the Merger, may be
hereinafter referred to as the " _Surviving Corporation_."

2.2 _Closing_. The closing of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
(the " _Closing_ ") shall take place at a mutually acceptable location
commencing at 10:00 a.m. local time on the fifth business day following the
satisfaction or waiver of all conditions of the parties to consummate
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (other than the conditions
with respect to actions the respective parties will take at the Closing
itself), or at such other place or on such other date as is mutually agreeable
to Parent and Shareholders Representative. The date and time of the Closing
are referred to herein as the " _Closing Date_."

2.3  _Filing of Certificate of Merger_. Subject to the conditions set forth
herein, the Company and the Merger Subsidiary shall as soon as possible on the
Closing Date or such other date as Parent and Shareholders Representative
shall agree, cause the merger to be consummated by filing with the Delaware
Division of Corporations a duly executed Certificate of Merger in the form
attached hereto as _Exhibit A_ (the " _Certificate of Merger_ ").

2.4 _Effect of Merger_. At the Effective Time, the effect of the Merger shall
be as provided herein and the applicable provisions of the DGCL. Without
limiting the generality of the foregoing, all of the properties, rights,
privileges, powers and franchises of the Company and the Merger Subsidiary
shall vest in the Surviving Corporation and all of the debts, liabilities,
duties and obligations of the Company and the Merger Subsidiary shall become
the debts, liabilities, duties and obligations of the Surviving Corporation.

2.5 _Effect on Stock._ Upon the terms and conditions of this Agreement, at the
Effective Time, as a result of the Merger and this Agreement and without the
need for any further action on the part of the Merger Subsidiary, the Company
or any of their respective shareholders, the following shall occur:

(a) _Conversion of Company Stock_. Immediately prior to the Effective Time,
by action of the board of directors of the Company, each share of Class L
Common Stock shall be converted into shares of Class A-1 Common Stock in
accordance with the terms of the Amended and Restated Certificate of
Incorporation of the Company. At the Effective Time, each share of the stock
issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time, after giving
effect to the conversion described in the preceding sentence, shall
be automatically converted into the right to receive, subject to the terms
and conditions of this Agreement, the Per Share Cash Consideration. Until
properly delivered to Parent or the Surviving Corporation pursuant to _Section
2.9_, any certificate evidencing shares of Company Stock (a " _Certificate_
") shall be deemed for all purposes to evidence only the right to receive the
consideration described in this _Section 2.5(a)_.



 

9 (b) _Conversion of Merger Subsidiary Stock_. Each share of the issued
and outstanding common stock of the Merger Subsidiary immediately prior to
the Effective Time shall be automatically converted into one (1) share of the
validly issued, fully paid and non-assessable authorized Class A-1 Common
Stock of the Surviving Corporation. Each stock certificate evidencing the
common stock of the Merger Subsidiary shall evidence ownership of such shares
of the Class A-1 Common Stock of the Surviving Corporation.

2.6 _Organizational Documents._ As of the Effective Time, the Certificate of
Incorporation and the Bylaws of the Merger Subsidiary shall become the
Certificate of Incorporation and the Bylaws of the Surviving Corporation.

2.7 _Officers and Directors._ As of the Effective Time, the officers and
directors of the Merger Subsidiary shall become the officers and directors of
the Surviving Corporation and shall serve as such until the expiration of
their term of office or their earlier death, resignation or removal.

2.8 _Closing_ _._

(a) _Cutoff Balance Sheet and Adjusted Cash_. On a date mutually acceptable to
the parties prior to Closing (the " _Cutoff Date_ ") which is seven to ten
(7-10) days prior to the Closing Date, the Shareholders Representative will
deliver to Parent a certificate containing a consolidated balance sheet of the
Company and GFA Brands as of the Cutoff Date (the " _Cutoff Date Balance
Sheet_ "), such other documentation regarding the financial condition of the
Company and GFA Brands as Parent may reasonably request and the Shareholders
Representatives calculation of Adjusted Cash, the reasonably expected
highest amount of the Bonus Payments and, based thereon, a calculation of the
Cash Consideration. The Company shall provide such written back-up
documentation as may be reasonably requested by Parent, and shall allow
Parent access to its books and records, sufficient to allow Parent to verify
the accuracy of the Cutoff Date Balance Sheet, the Companys operation of the
Business in the ordinary course and in accordance with this Agreement and the
accuracy of the calculation of Adjusted Cash, the amount of the Bonus
Payments and the calculation of Cash Consideration by the Shareholders
Representative.

(b) _Objection_. In the event Parent objects to any matter in the calculation
of Adjusted Cash, the Bonus Payments or Cash Consideration, Parent shall
notify the Shareholders Representative of its objection at least one (1) day
prior to Closing specifying the grounds for its objection in reasonable
detail. Parent and the Shareholders Representative shall meet in a good faith
attempt to resolve any objections. In the event Parent and the Shareholders
Representative are unable to agree on the amount of Adjusted Cash, the Bonus
Payments and Cash Consideration and the total amount in dispute exceeds Ten
Million Dollars ($10,000,000.00), neither the Company, Parent nor the
Merger Subsidiary shall be obligated to close the transactions  



 

10  contemplated hereby. In the event the total amount in dispute involves Ten
Million Dollars ($10,000,000.00) or less, at Closing (i) Cash
Consideration to be paid at Closing shall be equal to the lesser of the
parties calculation of Cash Consideration; (ii) the difference between the
parties calculation of Cash Consideration shall be deposited with an escrow
agent mutually acceptable to the Shareholders Representative and Parent;
(iii) in the event the parties are able to resolve any dispute, amounts held
in escrow including interest thereon shall be distributed on the joint
instructions of the Shareholders Representative and Parent; and (iv) in the
event the parties are unable to resolve any dispute within ten (10) days after
Closing, the parties shall submit unresolved disputes to arbitration pursuant
to  _Section 8.5_ hereof and the escrowed funds shall be distributed
pursuant to the arbitrators decision.

this Agreement, at the Closing, Parent shall deliver:

the Shareholders or the Paying Agent, as applicable (subject to any reduction
pursuant to _Section 2.8(b)_ hereof);

Payments which by the terms of the agreements giving rise to such Bonus
Payments are to be paid to such recipients contemporaneously with the Closing;

(iii) to an escrow agent mutually acceptable to the Shareholders
Representative, Parent and the recipients of the Bonus Payments, the amount of
the Bonus Payments (as calculated pursuant to _Section 2.8(a)_) not due and
payable at Closing. All interest earned on such escrowed amounts shall inure
to the benefit of and be paid to Parent and Parent shall be solely liable for
any Taxes that arise from such interest. If there is a dispute regarding the
amount of the Bonus Payments the reasonably expected highest proposed amount
of Bonus Payments not due and payable at the Closing shall be deposited into
escrow to be disbursed pursuant to _Section 2.8(e)_ hereof; and

(iv) all other items required to be delivered by Parent at Closing as
specified in _Section 3.1_ hereof.

calculation of Cash Consideration. Out of the amount placed in escrow pursuant
to _Section 2.8(c)(ii)_, (a) any increase in Cash Consideration as calculated
pursuant to this _Section 2.8(e)(i)_ from Cash Consideration as calculated
pursuant to _Section 2.8(a)_ shall be distributed to Shareholders entitled
thereto pro rata in accordance with their relative ownership percentage of the
Company pre-Closing, (b) the amount of the Bonus Payments due and payable
after the Closing as calculated pursuant to this _Section 2.8(e)(i)_ shall be
distributed to recipients of the Bonus Payments as and when payable in
accordance with the agreements pursuant to which such Bonus Payments are
payable, and (c) the remaining amounts held in escrow shall be distributed to
Parent.

(ii) To the extent that, pursuant to the terms of the applicable agreements,
any portion of the Bonus Payments that has been placed into escrow is no
longer payable to the recipients of the Bonus Payments, the calculation of
Cash Consideration shall be adjusted accordingly and, out of the amount
placed in escrow pursuant to _Section 2.8(c)(ii)_, (a) any increase in Cash
Consideration as calculated pursuant to this _Section 2.8(e)(ii)_ from Cash
Consideration as calculated pursuant to this  _Section 2.8(e)(i)_ shall be
distributed to the Shareholders entitled thereto pro rata in accordance with
their relative ownership percentage of the Company pre-Closing, (b) the amount

_Section 8.5_ hereof.

2.9 _Exchange of Certificates_.

(a) _Retention of Paying Agent; Development of Letter of Transmittal_. Prior
to the Closing, Parent and the Paying Agent will enter into a paying agent
agreement in customary form which will provide for payment of the applicable
portion of the Cash Consideration to the Shareholders pursuant to _Section
2.5(a)_ not later than five (5) business days following receipt after the

such Letter of Transmittal, duly completed and validly executed in accordance
with the instructions thereto, and such other documents as may reasonably
be required by the Paying Agent or such other agents, the holder of such
Certificate shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor an amount to

Surviving Corporation (subject to abandoned property, escheat or other similar
Laws) only as a general creditor thereof with respect to the  



 

13  portion of the Cash Consideration payable upon surrender of their
Certificates, without any interest thereon. Neither the Surviving Corporation

have been lost, stolen or destroyed, Parent shall cause the Paying Agent to
pay the Per Share Cash Consideration applicable to such shares in exchange for
such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificates, upon the making and delivery of
an affidavit of that fact by the holder thereof in a form
reasonably acceptable to Parent and if required by Parent: (i) in the case of
a Shareholder that is an individual, the posting by such person of a bond in
such amount as Parent may reasonably direct as indemnity against any claim
that may be made against it or the Surviving Corporation with respect to such
Certificate or ( _ii_ ) in the case of a Shareholder that is not an individual

agreement to indemnify against any claim that may be made against it or the
Surviving Corporation with respect to such Certificate.

entitled to withhold, or cause the Paying Agent to withhold, from any
consideration payable or deliverable pursuant to the terms of this Agreement
to any Shareholder, such amounts as may be required to be withheld pursuant
to any Law, including, without limitation, any amounts required to be withheld

Parent to the Shareholders Representative or the Paying Agent hereunder shall

2.13  _Optional Merger Consideration_.

(a) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained elsewhere in

("TSG4") and Parent agree that in the event any of Parents current
shareholders vote against the merger and elect to have their Boulder Common
Stock converted into cash in accordance with Article XII of Parents
Certificate of Incorporation (" _Boulder Certificate_ "), Parent, at its
option, may elect to pay up to Ten Million Dollars ($10,000,000) in Cash
Consideration otherwise payable to TSG4 in newly issued Parent common stock
("Parent Common Stock"), in lieu of cash. The total amount of Parent Common
Stock which Parent shall have the option to issue to TSG4 shall be equal to
the number of shares calculated by dividing (A) the lesser of: (i) Ten
Million Dollars ($10,000,000); and (ii) the aggregate per share conversion
price as calculated pursuant to Article XII of the Boulder Certificate for all
IPO Shares (as defined in the Boulder Certificate) which are timely and duly
converted pursuant to Article XII of the Boulder Certificate (such lesser
amount, the " _Conversion Amount_ ") by (B) the common stock price per share
to be paid by the purchasers of Parent Common Stock as finally determined
pursuant to the PIPE Securities Purchase Agreement attached hereto as Exhibit

registration rights consistent with the registration rights granted to the
purchasers of Parent Common Stock pursuant to the Registration Rights
Agreement to be executed at the Closing by the purchasers of Parent Common
Stock (including TSG4) pursuant to the PIPE Securities Purchase Agreement (the
"Registration Rights Agreement"). Nothing in this _Section 2.13_ shall be
deemed to alter or amend any other Shareholders (other than TSG4s) right to
receive in cash the Cash Consideration they may be entitled to pursuant to
this Agreement. If Parent exercises its election under this _Section 2.13_,
Parent shall deliver, at Closing, to TSG4 (x) stock certificates for TSG4
representing the Parent Common Stock deliverable pursuant to this Section 2.13
which certificates shall bear appropriate restrictive legends, and (y) the
Registration Rights Agreement which is attached as an exhibit to the
Securities Purchase Agreement, executed by Parent.

(b) TSG4 represents to the Parent as follows:

(i) TSG4 is acquiring the Parent Common Stock for its own account, for
investment and not with a view to the distribution thereof, nor with any
present intention of distributing the same.

(ii) TSG4 understands that the Parent Common Stock that may be issued under
this Section 2.13 has not been, and will not be, registered under the  



 

15  Securities Act, by reason of their issuance in a transaction exempt from the
registration requirements of the Securities Act, and that they must be
held indefinitely unless a subsequent disposition thereof is registered under
the Securities Act or is exempt from registration.

(iii) TSG4 understands that the exemption from registration afforded by Rule
144 (the provisions of which are known to TSG4) promulgated under the
Securities Act depends on the satisfaction of various conditions and that, if
applicable, Rule 144 may only afford the basis for sales under certain
circumstances and only in limited amounts.

(iv) TSG4 has had a reasonable time prior to the date hereof to ask questions
and receive answers concerning the terms and conditions of the offering of the
Parent Common Stock, and to obtain any additional information which the Parent
possesses or could acquire without unreasonable effort or expense, and has
generally such knowledge and experience in business and financial matters and
with respect to investments in securities as to enable TSG4 to understand and
evaluate the risks of such investment and form an investment decision with
respect thereto.

(v) TSG4 is an "accredited investor," as such term is defined in Rule 501
under the Securities Act.

(vi) TSG4 represents that from the date it was approached to participate in
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and continuing through the
Effectiveness Date (as such term is defined in the Registration Rights
Agreement), neither it nor, to its knowledge, its controlled subsidiaries have
engaged in any purchases or sales with respect to, or made any Short Sales
of, or granted any option for the purchase of or entered into any hedging or
similar transaction with the same economic effect as a Short Sale of the
Boulder Common Stock or Boulder Warrants, in each case, in violation of
applicable Laws that would have adverse consequences to the Parent. For the
purposes of this Agreement, "Short Sale" by TSG4 means a sale of Boulder
Common Stock or Boulder Warrants that is marked as a short sale and that is
executed at a time when TSG4 has no equivalent offsetting long position in the
Boulder Common Stock or Boulder Warrants, exclusive of the Parent Common Stock
that may be issued pursuant to this Agreement. For purposes of determining
whether TSG4 has an equivalent offsetting long position in the Boulder Common
Stock or Boulder Warrants, all Parent Common Stock that would be issuable upon
exercise in full of all options, convertible Parent Common Stock, swaps,
synthetic Parent Common Stock and other derivative Parent Common Stock then
held by TSG4 (assuming that such options, convertible Parent Common Stock,
swaps, synthetic Parent Common Stock or other derivative Parent Common Stock
were then fully exercisable, notwithstanding any provisions to the contrary,
and giving effect to any applicable exercise price adjustments scheduled to
take effect in the future) shall be deemed to be held long by TSG4.



 

16 (c) Parent represents to the TSG4 as follows:

(i) All of the shares of Parent Common Stock being delivered to the TSG4
pursuant to this _Section 2.13_ have been duly authorized, are validly
issued, fully paid and nonassessable and none were issued in violation of the
preemptive rights of any Person.

(d) The transfer restrictions are set forth as follows:

(i) Parent and TSG4 expressly acknowledge that the Parent Common Stock may
only be disposed of in compliance with state and federal securities laws. In
connection with any transfer of Parent Common Stock other than pursuant to an
effective registration statement or an exemption from the registration
requirements of the Securities Act, including pursuant to Section 4(2), Rule
144 or any other applicable exemption, to the Parent or to an Affiliate of
TSG4 or in connection with a pledge as contemplated in  _Section
2.13(d)(ii)_, the Parent may require the transferor thereof to provide to the
Parent an opinion of counsel selected by the transferor and reasonably
acceptable to the Parent, the form and substance of which opinion shall
be reasonably satisfactory to the Parent, to the effect that such transfer
does not require registration of such transferred Parent Common Stock under
the Securities Act. As a condition of transfer, any such transferee shall
agree in writing to be bound by the terms of _Section 2.13_ of this
Agreement and shall have the rights of TSG4 under _Section 2.13_ of this
Agreement and the Registration Rights Agreement.

(ii) TSG4 agrees to the imprinting, so long as is required by this _Section
2.13(d)_ of a legend on any of the Parent Common Stock in the following form:

THESE SECURITIES HAVE NOT BEEN REGISTERED WITH THE SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE
COMMISSION OR THE SECURITIES COMMISSION OF ANY STATE IN RELIANCE UPON AN
EXEMPTION FROM REGISTRATION UNDER THE SECURITIES ACT OF 1933, AS AMENDED (THE
"SECURITIES ACT"), AND, ACCORDINGLY, MAY NOT BE OFFERED OR SOLD EXCEPT
PURSUANT TO AN EFFECTIVE REGISTRATION STATEMENT UNDER THE SECURITIES ACT OR
PURSUANT TO AN AVAILABLE EXEMPTION FROM, OR IN A TRANSACTION NOT SUBJECT TO,
THE REGISTRATION REQUIREMENTS OF THE SECURITIES ACT AND IN ACCORDANCE WITH
APPLICABLE STATE SECURITIES LAWS AS EVIDENCED BY A LEGAL OPINION OF COUNSEL
TO THE TRANSFEROR TO SUCH EFFECT, THE SUBSTANCE OF WHICH SHALL BE REASONABLY
ACCEPTABLE TO THE ISSUER. THESE SECURITIES MAY BE PLEDGED IN CONNECTION WITH A
BONA FIDE MARGIN ACCOUNT WITH A REGISTERED BROKER-DEALER OR OTHER LOAN WITH A
FINANCIAL INSTITUTION THAT IS AN "ACCREDITED INVESTOR" AS DEFINED IN RULE
501(a) UNDER THE SECURITIES ACT OR OTHER LOAN SECURED BY SUCH SECURITIES.

for the six (6) month period ending



 

50  June 30, 2006 (it being understood that a decline in EBITDA of up to five

object within ten (10) business days of its receipt of the June 30 Financial

the Shareholders Representative if the transactions contemplated hereby have
not been consummated by February 16, 2007; _provided_ , _however_ , that a
party shall not be entitled to terminate this Agreement pursuant to
this subsection (d) if that partys breach of this Agreement has prevented

time;

(e) by the Company if Parent has not filed the Proxy Statement with the SEC
within ten (10) days of receiving all of the Financial Statements other than

parties agree to meet and to discuss in good faith as to whether it
is reasonable and practicable to expect SEC approval within a reasonable
period of time, and in the event the parties agree that such approval is
reasonably likely within a reasonable period of time, the parties may, but
neither party shall be obligated to, agree upon a new termination date;

Any dispute between the parties with respect to any partys right to terminate
this Agreement shall be resolved in accordance with _Section 8.5_.

7.2 _Effect of Termination_. In the event of termination of this Agreement as
provided in _Section 7.1_ hereof, this Agreement shall forthwith become void
and there shall be no liability or obligation hereunder on the part of any of

breach of this Agreement prior to the time of such termination, the other
parties hereto shall be entitled to the remedy of specific performance of the
covenants contained herein.

7.3 _Waiver of Right to Terminate_. Parent shall be deemed to have waived its
right to terminate this Agreement upon consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby. No such waiver shall constitute a waiver of any other
rights arising from the non-fulfillment of any condition precedent set forth

warranty, covenant or agreement contained herein unless such waiver is made
in writing and then any such written waiver shall only constitute a waiver of

ARTICLE VIII

_ADDITIONAL AGREEMENTS; COVENANTS AFTER CLOSING _

8.1 _No Indemnification_. All representations and warranties contained in this
Agreement shall expire at the Closing. From and after the Closing, no party
hereto shall have any remedy with respect to breaches of the representations
and warranties or pre-Closing covenants contained in this Agreement or
otherwise arising out of or related to this Agreement or the transactions
contemplated hereby (other than claims for fraud) and each party hereto hereby
waives to the maximum extent permissible under applicable law any and all such
claims, whether or not known at the Closing.

8.2 _Mutual Assistance_. Subsequent to the Closing, each of the parties
hereto, at their own cost, will assist each other (including by the retention
of records and the provision of access to relevant records) in the preparation
of their respective Tax Returns and the filing and execution of Tax elections,
if required, as well as in the defense of any audits or litigation that may
ensue as a result of the filing thereof, to the extent that such assistance
is reasonably requested.



 

52 8.3 _Confidentiality_. The Company shall require each Shareholder to agree
that, for the period of two (2) years from and after the Closing Date, it
shall hold in strict confidence and will keep confidential all information
regarding the Company, GFA Brands and the Business and will not use or
disclose any such information to any Person except: (a) with the prior
written consent of Parent and the Shareholder Representative; (b) to the
extent that such disclosure is required by Law (provided that the disclosing
party agrees to give to Parent prompt notice thereof so that Parent may seek
a protective order or other appropriate remedy in connection therewith); (c)
to the extent that such information can be shown to be generally available to
the public other than as a result of disclosure by the Shareholders or their
representatives or employees; or (d) that each Shareholder and its or his
representatives may disclose to any and all Persons, without limitation of any
kind, the tax treatment, tax strategies and tax structure of the transaction
and all materials of any kind (including opinions or other tax analyses) that
are provided to such Shareholder and its or his representatives relating to
such tax treatment, tax strategies and tax structure.

8.4 _Expenses_. Except as otherwise set forth in this Agreement, each of the
parties hereto shall be solely responsible for and shall bear all of its own
costs and expenses incident to its obligations under and in respect of this
Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby, including, but not limited
to, any such costs and expenses incurred by any party hereto in connection
with the negotiation, preparation and performance of and compliance with the
terms of this Agreement (including, without limitation, the fees and expenses
of legal counsel, accountants, investment bankers or other representatives and
consultants), regardless of whether the transactions contemplated hereby are
consummated, it being understood and agreed that the Shareholders shall pay
all costs, fees and expenses incurred by the Company or GFA Brands in
connection with this transaction prior to Closing, or, if not paid, the Cash
Consideration to be paid at Closing shall be reduced by (a) the amount of such
costs, fees and expenses and (b) if requested by the Shareholders
Representative, a reasonable estimate of such costs, fees and expenses to be
incurred post-Closing (to be held by the Shareholder Representative and
disbursed as Cash Consideration to the extent such reserved amount exceeds the
actual costs, fees and expenses).

8.5 _Disputes; Arbitration Procedure_.

(a) Each of the parties hereto agrees that it will attempt to settle any
dispute, claim or controversy arising out of this Agreement through good faith
negotiations in the spirit of mutual cooperation between senior business
executives of Parent and Shareholders Representative with authority to
resolve the controversy.

(b) Any dispute, claim or controversy (other than claims for equitable relief
or rescission of this Agreement) that cannot be resolved by the parties hereto
through good faith negotiations within thirty (30) days of notification to the
counter-party of the commencement of the dispute resolution procedures of
this _Section 8.5_ will then, upon the written request of any party hereto,
be resolved by binding arbitration conducted in accordance with the then
effective Commercial Arbitration Rules of the American Arbitration
Association by a sole arbitrator. Such arbitrator shall be mutually agreeable
to the parties. If the parties cannot mutually agree upon the selection of an
arbitrator, the arbitrator shall be selected in accordance with the rules of
the then effective  



 

53  Commercial Arbitration Rules of the American Arbitration Association. To the
extent not governed by such rules, such arbitrator shall be directed by
the parties to set a schedule for determination of such dispute, claim or
controversy that is reasonable under the circumstances. Such arbitrator shall
be directed by the parties to determine the dispute in accordance with this
Agreement and the substantive rules of law (but not the rules of procedure or
evidence) that would be applied by a federal court required to apply the
internal law (and not the law of conflicts) of the State of Delaware. The
arbitration will be conducted in Chicago, Illinois. Judgment upon the award
rendered by the arbitrator may be entered by any court having jurisdiction.

(c) Nothing contained in this _Section 8.5_ shall prevent any party hereto
from resorting to judicial process if injunctive or other equitable relief
from a court is necessary to prevent injury to such party or its Affiliates.
The use of arbitration procedures will not be construed under the doctrine of
laches, waiver or estoppel to affect adversely the rights of any party hereto
to assert any claim or defense.

8.6 _Further Transfers_. Each of the parties hereto shall, and shall cause its
Affiliates to, execute and deliver such further instruments and take such
additional action as any other party hereto may reasonably request to effect
or consummate the transactions contemplated hereby. Each such party shall, on
or prior to the Closing, use its best efforts to fulfill or obtain the
fulfillment of the conditions precedent to the consummation of
the transactions contemplated hereby, including the execution and delivery of
any documents, certificates, instruments or other papers that are reasonably
required for the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby.

8.7 _Transfer Taxes; Recording Charges_. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary herein, all transfer, documentary, sales, use, stamp, registration
and other such similar Taxes, and all conveyance fees, recording charges and
other fees and charges (including any penalties and interest) incurred in
connection with consummation of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement shall be paid by the party incurring such Taxes when due, and each
party will, at their own expense, file all necessary Tax Returns and other
documentation with respect to all such Taxes, fees and charges, and, if
required by applicable law.

 

8.8 _Shareholders  Representative_. The Shareholders Representative is
hereby designated to serve as the representative of the Shareholders with
respect to all of the matters contemplated by this Agreement. The
Shareholders Representative will act as the agent, proxy and attorney-in-fact
for each Shareholder for all purposes of this Agreement, including full power
and authority on such Shareholders behalf (a) to consummate the transactions
contemplated herein, (b) to pay, and be entitled to reimbursement by the
Shareholders for, such Shareholders expenses (whether incurred on or after
the date hereof) incurred in connection with the negotiation and performance
of this Agreement, (c) to disburse any funds received hereunder to such
Shareholder, (d) to execute and deliver any certificates representing the
Companys capital stock and execution of such further instruments as Parent
shall reasonably request, (e) to execute and deliver on behalf of such
Shareholder any amendment or waiver hereto, (f) to take all other actions to
be taken by or on behalf of such Shareholder in connection herewith, (g) to
negotiate, settle, compromise and otherwise handle all claims pursuant hereto
and (h) to do each and every act and exercise any and all rights which such
Shareholder is, or the  



 

54  Shareholders collectively are, permitted or required to do or exercise under
this Agreement. Neither the Shareholders Representative nor any
agent employed by it shall incur any liability to any Shareholder relating to
the performance of its duties hereunder except for actions or omissions
constituting fraud, bad faith or willful misconduct. Parent shall be entitled
to rely on the delegation of authority contained in this _Section 8.8_.

8.9 _Employees_.

(a) As soon as reasonably practicable following the Merger, Parent shall cause
the Surviving Corporation to provide that Company employees with base
compensation and bonus (except for sale bonuses, stock option plans and
similar type plans) or commission opportunity that is the same as or greater
than the amount paid or payable to such employees prior to the Effective Time,
provided such employee does not voluntarily reduce his/her hours or job
duties or responsibilities and such employees shall, be covered under benefit
plans, programs, policies and arrangements (" _Parent Plans_ ") that are in
the aggregate no less favorable than that provided to similarly situated
employees of Parent. Years of service with the Company and its subsidiaries
prior to the Effective Time shall be treated as service with the Surviving
Corporation or Parent for eligibility and vesting purposes and for purposes
of vacation and severance pay accruals, except to the extent such treatment
will result in a duplication of benefits.

(b) For one year following the Merger, in the event Parent determines to
change its medical or dental benefit plans or to utilize a different indemnity
carrier, Parent shall use its best efforts to obtain a waiver as to
preexisting conditions, exclusions and waiting periods with respect to
participation and coverage requirements applicable to the employees of the
Company as of the date of the Closing for any such new medical or dental
benefit plans that such employees are eligible to participate in after the
Effective Time, other than limitations, exclusions or waiting periods that are
in effect as of the date hereof or on the Closing Date with respect to such
employees and that have not been satisfied as of the Effective Time under any
medical or dental plan maintained for such employees immediately prior to the
Effective Time by the Company or a Subsidiary of the Company.

58  the extent permitted by law, each of the parties hereto hereby irrevocably

Security Card, from your local Social Security Administration office or get
this form online at www.socialsecurity.gov/online/ss-5.pdf. You may also get
this form by calling 1-800-772-1213. Use Form W-7, Application for IRS
Individual Taxpayer Identification Number, to apply for an ITIN, or Form SS-4,
Application for Employer Identification Number, to apply for an EIN. You can
apply for an EIN online by accessing the IRS website at
www.irs.gov/businesses/ and clicking on Employer ID Numbers under Related
Topics. You can get Forms W-7 and SS-4 from the IRS by visiting www.irs.gov or
by calling 1-800-TAX-FORM (1-800-829-3676).

 

To complete the Substitute Form W-9 if you do not have a TIN, write "Applied
For" in the space provided for the TIN, complete the Certificate of
Awaiting Taxpayer Identification Number, sign and date the form and return it
to the Exchange Agent. For interest and dividend payments, and certain
payments made with respect to readily tradable instruments, generally you will
have 60 days to get a TIN and give it to the Exchange Agent before you are
subject to backup withholding on payments. The 60 day rule does not apply to
other types of payments. You will be subject to backup withholding on all such
payments until provide your TIN to the Exchange Agent.

Note: Writing "Applied For" means that you have already applied for a TIN or
that you intend to apply for one soon.

Withholding.If you make a false statement with no reasonable basis which
results in no imposition of backup withholding, you are subject to a penalty
of $500. falsifying certifications or affirmations may subject you to criminal
penalties including fines and/or imprisonment.

or dividends, or (ii) the IRS has notified the holder that the holder is no
longer subject to backup withholding; or (b) provide an adequate basis for
exemption.

If "Applied For" is written in Part I of the substitute Form W-9, please
complete and sign the separate Certificate of Awaiting
Taxpayer Identification Number, and we will retain 28% of any payment during
the 60-day period following the date of the Substitute Form W-9. If the holder
furnishes us with his or her TIN within 60 days of the date of the Substitute
W-9, we will remit such amount retained during the 60-day period to the
holder, and no further amounts will be retained or withheld from any payment
made to the holder thereafter. If, however, the holder has not provided us
with his or her TIN within such 60-day period, we will remit such previously
retained amounts to the IRS as backup withholding and withhold 28% of any
payment for the surrendered Shares made to the holder thereafter unless the
holder furnishes a TIN to us prior to any such subsequent payment.
In general, an individuals TIN is the individuals Social Security Number.
If we are not provided with the correct TIN or an adequate basis for
exemption, the holder may be subject to a $50 penalty imposed by the IRS and
backup withholding at a rate of 28%.

Failure to complete the Substitute Form W-9 will not, by itself, cause Shares
to be deemed invalidly delivered, but may require us to withhold 28% of the
amount of any payments for such Shares. Backup withholding is not an
additional federal income tax. Rather, the federal income tax liability of a
person subject to backup withholding will be reduced by the amount of tax
withheld. If withholding results in an overpayment of taxes, a refund may be
obtained, provided the appropriate returns are filed with the IRS. Holders are
urged to consult their own tax advisors.

8\. _Form W-8 for Non-U.S. Persons._ Non-U.S. holders may not be subject to
these backup withholding and reporting requirements. A non-U.S. holder must
submit a properly completed appropriate IRS Form W-8, signed under the
penalties of perjury, attesting to that    holders non-U.S. holder status. The appropriate IRS form may be obtained
via the IRS website at www.irs.gov. Holders are urged to consult their own
tax advisors to ensure proper completion of the proper version of Form W-8.

9\. _Federal and State Income Tax Withholding_. We may withhold federal and
state income tax required to be withheld under applicable law from the amounts
payable under the Merger Agreement. Holders are urged to consult their own tax
advisors.

11\. _Holders who are Nominees._ Any record holder of Certificate(s) may
submit two or more Letters of Transmittal, each covering a portion of the
Shares represented thereby, provided that such record holder submits with such
Letters of Transmittal a certificate satisfactory to the effect that such
record holder holds such shares as nominee for more than one owner. 

12\. _Address Changes_. If you anticipate changing your address in the near
future, please keep us informed of your new address by sending us a revised
Letter of Transmittal.

13\. _Miscellaneous._ The terms and conditions of the Merger Agreement
are incorporated herein by reference in their entirety and shall be deemed to
form a part of the terms and conditions of this Letter of Transmittal. EXHIBIT C
