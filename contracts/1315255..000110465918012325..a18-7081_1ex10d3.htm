representations herein, Purchaser does not agree to hold any of the Securities
for any minimum period of time and reserves the right, subject to the
provisions of this Agreement, the Certificate of Designations and the Investor
Rights Agreement, at all times to sell or

 



      
 

 



 

otherwise dispose of all or any part of such Securities pursuant to an
effective registration statement under the Securities Act or under an
exemption from such registration and in compliance with applicable federal and
state securities laws. Purchaser is acquiring the Securities hereunder in the
ordinary course of its business. Purchaser does not presently have any
agreement, plan or understanding, directly or indirectly, with any Person to
distribute or effect any distribution of any of the Securities (or any
securities which are derivatives thereof) to or through any Person; Purchaser
is not a registered broker-dealer under Section 15 of the Exchange Act or an
entity engaged in a business that would require it to be so registered as a
broker-dealer.

 



 

(d) At the time Purchaser was offered the Preferred Shares, it was, and at the
date hereof it is, an "accredited investor" as defined in Rule 501(a) under
the Securities Act.

 



 

(e) Purchaser is not purchasing the Preferred Shares as a result of any
advertisement, article, notice or other communication regarding the Preferred
Shares published in any newspaper, magazine or similar media or broadcast over
television or radio or presented at any seminar or any other general
advertisement.

 



 

(f) Purchaser, either alone or together with its representatives, has such
knowledge, sophistication and experience in business and financial matters so
as to be capable of evaluating the merits and risks of the prospective
investment in the Securities, and has so evaluated the merits and risks of
such investment. Purchaser is able to bear the economic risk of an investment
in the Securities and, at the current time, is able to afford a complete loss
of such investment.

 



 

(g) Purchaser acknowledges that it has been afforded (i) the opportunity to
ask such questions as it has deemed necessary of, and to receive answers from,
representatives of the Company concerning the terms and conditions of the
offering of the Securities and the merits and risks of investing in the
Securities; (ii) access to information about the Company and the subsidiaries
and their respective financial condition, results of operations, business,
properties, management and prospects; and (iii) the opportunity to obtain such
additional information that the Company possesses or can acquire without
unreasonable effort or expense. Neither such inquiries nor any other
investigation conducted by or on behalf of Purchaser or its representatives or
counsel shall modify, amend or affect Purchasers right to rely on the truth,
accuracy and completeness of the Companys representations and warranties
contained in the Transaction Documents.

 



 

(h) Other than with respect to the transactions contemplated herein, since the
time that Purchaser was first contacted by the Company or any other Person
regarding the transactions contemplated hereby, neither Purchaser nor any
Trading Affiliate of Purchaser has directly or indirectly, nor has any Person
acting on behalf of or pursuant to any understanding with Purchaser or Trading
Affiliate, effected or agreed to effect any purchases or sales of the
securities of the Company (including, without limitation, any Short Sales
involving the Companys securities).

 



 

(i) No Person will have, as a result of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, any valid right, interest or claim against or upon the Company or
Purchaser for any commission, fee or other compensation pursuant to any
agreement, arrangement or understanding entered into by or on behalf of
Purchaser.

 



 

(j) Purchaser has independently evaluated the merits of its decision to
purchase the Preferred Shares pursuant to the Transaction Documents. Purchaser
understands that nothing in this Agreement or any other materials presented by
or on behalf of the Company to Purchaser in connection with the purchase of
the Preferred Shares constitutes legal, tax or investment advice. Purchaser
has

 



      
 

 



 

consulted such legal, tax and investment advisors as it, in its sole
discretion, has deemed necessary or appropriate in connection with its
purchase of the Preferred Shares.

 



 

(k) Purchaser understands that the Preferred Shares are being offered and sold
to it in reliance on specific exemptions from the registration requirements of
United States federal and state securities laws and that the Company is
relying in part upon the truth and accuracy of, and Purchasers compliance
with, the representations, warranties, agreements, acknowledgements and
understandings of Purchaser set forth herein in order to determine the
availability of such exemptions and the eligibility of Purchaser to acquire
the Preferred Shares.

 



 

(l) Purchaser understands that no United States federal or state agency or any
other government or governmental agency has passed on or made any
recommendation or endorsement of the Securities or the fairness or suitability
of the investment in the Securities nor have such authorities passed upon or
endorsed the merits of the offering of the Securities.

 



 

(m) Purchaser beneficially owns 4,000,000 shares of Common Stock of the
Company (the " _Purchaser Shares_ ") (not including, for avoidance of doubt,
the Conversion Shares). Other than the Purchaser Shares, none Purchaser or its
Trading Affiliates beneficially owns any Common Stock or Equity Interests of
the Company (other than pursuant to the Transaction Documents).

 



 

(n) Purchasers offices in which its investment decision with respect to the
Preferred Shares was made are located at the address set forth for notices to
be delivered to Purchaser in _Section 6.3_.

 



 

The Company and Purchaser acknowledge and agree that no party to this
Agreement has made or makes any representations or warranties with respect to
the transactions contemplated hereby other than those specifically set forth
in this _Article III_ and the Transaction Documents.

(b) _Removal of Legends_. The legend set forth in _Section 4.1(a)_ above
shall be removed and the Company shall issue a certificate without such legend
or any other legend to the holder of the applicable Securities upon which it

Certificates for Securities subject to legend removal hereunder may be
transmitted by the Transfer Agent to Purchaser by crediting the account of
Purchasers prime broker with DTC as directed by Purchaser.

 



 

4.2 _Integration_. The Company shall not, and shall use its reasonable best
efforts to ensure that no Affiliate of the Company shall, sell, offer for sale
or solicit offers to buy or otherwise negotiate in respect of any security (as
defined in Section 2 of the Securities Act) that will be integrated with the
offer or sale of the Securities in a manner that would require the
registration under the Securities Act of the sale of the Securities to
Purchaser, or that will be integrated with the offer or sale of the Securities
for purposes of the rules and regulations of any Trading Market such that it
would require stockholder approval prior to the closing of such other
transaction, the transactions contemplated hereby or (other than the
Stockholder Approval) the issuance of the Conversion Shares.

 



 

4.3 _Use of Proceeds_. The Company shall use the net proceeds from the sale of
the Preferred Shares hereunder to fund the its acquisition of Interoute
Communications Holdings S.A. as contemplated by the Acquisition Agreement, and
to pay related transaction expenses.

 



 

4.4 _Form D; Blue Sky_. The Company agrees to timely file a Form D with
respect to the Securities as required under Regulation D and to provide a copy
thereof, promptly upon the written request of Purchaser. The Company, on or
before the Closing Date, shall take such action as the Company shall
reasonably determine is necessary in order to obtain an exemption for or to
qualify the Securities for sale to Purchaser under applicable securities or
"Blue Sky" laws of the states of the United States (or to obtain an exemption
from such qualification) and shall provide evidence of such actions promptly
upon the written request of Purchaser.

 



 

4.5 _Short Sales_. If, during the period commencing on the date hereof ending
on the first to occur of (a) the Closing or (b) termination of this Agreement
in accordance with its terms pursuant to Section _6.15_ , the Company
notifies Purchaser that it intends to conduct a public offering of Common
Stock, then Purchaser shall not, and shall cause its Trading Affiliates not
to, engage, in any sales or Short Sales involving the Companys securities
during the period commencing with receipt of such notice and ending on the
first to occur of (i) the closing or the abandonment of such public offering
or (ii) (A) the Closing (in which case, any such restrictions will be governed
solely by the Investor Rights Agreement) or (B) termination of this Agreement
in accordance with its terms pursuant to _Section 6.15_; _provided_ ,
_however_ , the foregoing shall not apply to a bona fide pledge or the
enforcement thereof or a sale or transfer of shares pursuant thereto.
Purchaser understands and acknowledges, severally and not jointly with any
other Purchaser, that the staff of the Commission has taken the position that
covering a short position established prior to effectiveness of a resale
registration statement with shares included in such registration statement
would be a violation of Section 5 of the Securities Act, and is aware of Item
65, Section 5 under Section A, of the Manual of Publicly Available Telephone
Interpretations, dated July 1997, compiled by the Office of Chief Counsel,
Division of Corporation Finance.

to any limitation on conversions pursuant to the Certificate of Designations,
any rules of a Trading Market or otherwise, including any applicable
limitations related to obtaining stockholder approval of such issuance); and
(b) not effect any voluntary deregistration under the Exchange Act or any
voluntary delisting with the New York Stock Exchange in respect of the
Conversion Shares other than in connection with a Change of Control (as
defined in the Certificate of Designations) pursuant to which the Company
agrees to satisfy, or will otherwise cause the satisfaction, in full of its
obligations under the Certificate of Designations.

 



 

4.7 _Funding Notice_. The Company shall deliver a written notice of funding to
Purchaser at least two Business Days prior to the anticipated Closing Date;
_provided_ , that such notice may not be delivered until all conditions to the
consummation of the transactions contemplated by the Acquisition Agreement

V_).

 



 

(b) Each of Purchaser and the Company shall use reasonable best efforts to

other party hereto of any communication between Purchaser or the Company, as
applicable, and any Governmental Entity regarding any of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement. Without limiting the foregoing, Purchaser, the
Company and their respective Affiliates shall not extend any waiting period,
review period or comparable period under the HSR Act or enter into any
agreement with any Governmental Entity not to consummate the transactions
contemplated hereby, except with the prior written consent of the other party
hereto, and if approval under the HSR Act is so conditioned, Purchaser agrees
to take all actions that are required by any Governmental Entity to
expeditiously consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
(subject, in the case of conversion of the Preferred Shares into Common Stock,

obligation to a third party) and (C) enter into, amend, assign or terminate
licenses or other agreements (other than as would result in a breach of a
license or such other agreement with a third party), but in each case only if,
and to the extent that, taking such actions would satisfy the conditions of
such Governmental Entity.

 



      
 

 



 

(c) Purchaser and the Company will have the right to review in advance, and to
the extent practicable each will consult with the other, in each case subject
to applicable laws relating to the exchange of information, all the
information relating to such other party, and any of their respective
Affiliates, which appears in any filing made with, or written materials
submitted to, any third party or any Governmental Entity in connection with
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. In exercising the foregoing
right, each of the parties hereto agrees to act reasonably and as promptly as
reasonably practicable. Each party hereto agrees to keep the other party
apprised of the status of matters referred to in this _Section 4.8_.

 



 

(d) In the event any claim, action, suit, investigation or other Proceeding by
any Governmental Entity or other Person is commenced which questions the
validity or legality of the transactions contemplated hereby or seeks damages
in connection therewith, each of Purchaser and the Company agree to cooperate
and use reasonable best efforts to defend against such claim, action, suit,
investigation or other Proceeding and, if an injunction or other order is
issued in any such action, suit or other Proceeding, to use commercially
reasonable efforts to have such injunction or other order lifted, and to
cooperate reasonably regarding any other impediment to the consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby.

 



 

(e) In the event that a Governmental Entity issues a request for additional
information or documentary material pursuant to the HSR Act (the " _Second
Request_ ") in connection with the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, then Purchaser and the Company shall make (or cause to be made), as
soon as reasonably practicable and after consultation with the other, an
appropriate response in compliance with the Second Request in order to obtain
expiration or termination of the applicable waiting period.

 



 

(f) Purchaser and the Company shall not, and shall cause their controlled
Affiliates (which, for purposes of this _Section 4.8(f)_, shall exclude any
portfolio company of Purchaser) not to, acquire or agree to acquire, by
merging with or into or consolidating with, or by purchasing a portion of the
assets of or equity in, or by any other manner, any business or any
corporation, partnership, association or other business organization or
division thereof, or otherwise acquire or agree to acquire any assets or
equity interests, if the entering into of a definitive agreement relating to,
or the consummation of, such acquisition, merger or consolidation would
reasonably be expected to: (i) impose any delay in the obtaining of, or
increase (in any non-de minimis respect) the risk of not obtaining, any
consents of any Governmental Entity necessary to consummate the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement or the expiration or termination of any
applicable waiting period; (ii) increase (in any non-de minimis respect) the
risk of any Governmental Entity seeking or entering an order prohibiting the
consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement; (iii)
increase the risk (in any non-de minimis respect) of not being able to remove
any such order on appeal or otherwise; or (iv) delay or prevent the
consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

 



 

4.9 _Interim Operating Covenants of the Company_. Except as expressly
contemplated by this Agreement, from and after the date hereof until the
earlier of the Closing Date or the termination of this Agreement in accordance
with its terms, the Company shall, and cause each of its subsidiaries to,
except as consented to in writing by Purchaser:

 



 

(a) not take any action that if taken after the Closing Date, would require
the approval of a majority of the shares of the outstanding Preferred Stock
pursuant to the terms of the Certificate of Designations, assuming for such
purposes that the Certificate of Designations was in full force and effect and
the "Original Issue Date" (as defined in the Certificate of Designations) was
the date of this Agreement;

 



      
 

 



 

(b) not take any action that, if taken after the Closing Date, would (i) give
rise to any "Change of Control" or other "Fundamental Corporate Transaction"
or any adjustment to the "Conversion Rate" under the Certificate of
Designations (with such terms having the definitions ascribed thereto in the
Certificate of Designations for the purpose of this clause (i)), other than
the sale of Equity Securities not in violation of Section 4.9(a), assuming the
Certificate of Designations was in full force and effect and the "Original
Issuance Date" (as defined in the Certificate of Designations) was the date
hereof, or (ii) give rise to any rights of Purchaser to participating
dividends under the Certificate of Designations assuming it was in full force
and effect;

 



 

(c) notify Purchaser promptly upon any termination of, or material breach (or
alleged material breach) of the Acquisition Agreement by the Company or any of
its Affiliates or, to the Companys Knowledge, any other party thereto;

 



 

(d) not modify, amend or waive any term of the Acquisition Agreement in any
manner materially adverse to Purchaser; it being agreed and understood that
(i) any reduction in aggregate purchase price from the original aggregate
purchase price set forth in the Acquisition Agreement shall not be materially
adverse to the interests of Purchaser and (ii) any increase in purchase price
shall not be materially adverse to Purchaser so long as such increase is
funded with the proceeds of Junior Securities as such term is defined in the
Certificate of Designations, or with such proceeds and additional indebtedness
that does not increase the Companys debt to equity leverage ratio from that
contemplated by the debt commitments provided to the Company as of the date of
this Agreement; and

 



 

(e) not enter into any agreement with respect to its securities which would be
inconsistent with or violate the rights granted to the holders of Registrable
Securities pursuant to the Investor Rights Agreement (assuming it was in full
force and effect as of the date hereof).

 



 

4.10 _Adjustments_. If any occurrence since the date of this Agreement until
the Closing would have resulted in an adjustment to the "Conversion Rate" (as
defined in the Certificate of Designations) under the Certificate of
Designations if the Preferred Shares had been issued and outstanding since the
date of this Agreement, the Company shall adjust the "Conversion Rate" as of
the Closing in the same manner as would have been required by the Certificate
of Designations if the Preferred Shares had been issued and outstanding since
the date of this Agreement. This _Section 4.10_ shall not be deemed to cure
any breach of _Section 4.9_ and Purchaser reserve all rights and remedies in
connection with any such breach of _Section 4.9_ notwithstanding the
provisions of this _Section 4.10_.

 



 

4.11 _Notification of Certain Matters_. Notwithstanding anything else herein
to the contrary, the Company and Purchaser shall give prompt written notice to
the other of (a) any notice or other communication from any Person alleging
that any consent, waiver or approval from, or notification requirement to,
such Person is or may be required in connection with the transactions
contemplated by the Transaction Documents, (b) all effects, changes, events
and occurrences arising subsequent to the date of this Agreement which could
reasonably be expected to result in any breach of a representation or warranty
or covenant of the Company in this Agreement that would, if occurring or
continuing on the Closing Date, cause any of the conditions set forth in
Article V not to be satisfied, (c) any effect, change, event or occurrence
that, individually or in the aggregate, would reasonably be expected to have a
Material Adverse Effect and (d) any litigation relating to the transactions
contemplated by the Transaction Documents (the " _Transaction Litigation_ ")
and any updates to the status thereof. The Company and its subsidiaries shall
give Purchaser an opportunity to discuss with the Company and its
representatives any Transaction Litigation (subject to the entry into any
joint defense or similar agreement and otherwise subject to the protection of
any attorney-client or other similar doctrine or privilege) and the Company
and its representatives shall consider Purchasers recommendations with
respect thereto in good faith. For the avoidance of doubt, no updated
information provided in accordance with this _Section 4.11_ shall be

 



      
 

 



 

deemed to cure any breach of any representation, warranty or covenant made in
this Agreement or affect any rights under this Agreement or the other
Transaction Documents.

authorize and approve (the " _Stockholder Approval_ "), as required by one or
more provisions of Rule 312.03 of the NYSE Listed Company Manual or any
successor rule, the issuance of all Conversion Shares issuable upon the
conversion of the Preferred Shares (which conversion, for avoidance of doubt,
shall occur upon or after such approval pursuant to and in accordance with the
terms of the Certificate of Designations), and a recommendation by the Board
of Directors in favor of the approval of such proposal (providing the highest
level of support for the approval of such proposal as the Board of Director
provides to any other proposal included in such proxy statement), which
recommendation shall not be withdrawn, qualified or modified.

 



 

(ii) If the Company does not obtain the Stockholder Approval at its first
annual meeting after the Closing Date, the Company shall use its reasonable
best efforts to obtain the Stockholder Approval as promptly as practicable
thereafter, including by holding one or more special meetings prior to the
following annual meeting and thereafter to solicit the Stockholder Approval.
Any such proxy shall include a recommendation by the Board of Directors in
favor of such proposal equivalent to that required pursuant to _Section
4.12(a)(i)_, which recommendation shall not be withdrawn, qualified or
modified.

 



 

(iii) The Company shall notify Purchaser promptly of the receipt of any
comments from the Commission or its staff with respect to any proxy statement
in which the Stockholder Approval is sought and of any request by the SEC or
its staff for amendments or supplements to such proxy statement or for
additional information and will supply Purchaser with copies of all
correspondence between the Company or any of its representatives, on the one
hand, and the SEC or its staff, on the other hand, with respect to such proxy
statement. The Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to respond to any
such comments from the Commission or its staff. The Company shall consult with
Purchaser prior to filing any such proxy statement, or any amendment or
supplement thereto, or responding to any comments from the Commission or its
staff with respect thereto, and provide Purchaser with a reasonable
opportunity to comment thereon, and consider in good faith any comments
proposed by Purchaser.

 



 

(b) _NYSE Listing_. The Company shall prepare and submit to the New York Stock
Exchange a listing application for the shares of Common Stock issuable upon
conversion of the Preferred Shares, in order to obtain the written approval
from the New York Stock Exchange for the listing of such shares upon
conversion. Such application shall be made at such date after the date of this
Agreement as Purchaser may request, or such earlier date as the Company may
determine in its sole discretion.

 



 

(c) _Reorganization_. At any time the Company may, and in the event the
Stockholder Approval has not been obtained, the Company shall, no later than
November 15, 2018, reorganize its corporate structure via a merger that does
not require the approval of the Companys stockholders pursuant to Section
251(g) of the General Corporation Law of the state of Delaware (the "
_Reorganization_ "), such that the Company shall thereafter be a wholly owned
subsidiary of a parent holding company (" _Holdco_ ") and the Preferred Shares
shall by operation of law be converted into shares

 



      
 

 



 

of Holdco having the same designations, rights, powers and preferences and the
qualifications, limitations and restrictions as the Preferred Shares.

 



 

4.13 _Publicity_. The Company shall not publicly disclose the name of
Purchaser or an Affiliate of Purchaser, or include the name of Purchaser or an
Affiliate of Purchaser in any press release or filing with the Commission or
any regulatory agency or Trading Market, without the prior written consent of
Purchaser, except (i) as required by federal securities law in connection with
(A) any registration statement contemplated by the Investor Rights Agreement
and (B) the filing of final Transaction Documents (including signature pages
thereto) with the Commission and (ii) to the extent such disclosure is
required by law, request of the Commission or Trading Market regulations, in
which case the Company shall provide Purchaser with a reasonable opportunity
to comment on such disclosure in advance.

 



 

4.14 _Certain Tax Matters_.

 



 

(a) The Company shall pay any and all documentary, stamp and similar issue or
transfer tax due upon the issuance of (i) the Preferred Shares, (ii) the
Conversion Shares and (iii) any shares in Holdco issued to Purchaser, and the
Company will, at its own expense, file all necessary tax returns and other
documentation with respect to all such taxes and fees.

 



 

(b) Unless required as a result of a change in law, Purchaser and the Company
agree not to treat the Preferred Shares as "preferred stock" within the
meaning of Section 305 and 1.305-5 of the Internal Revenue Code for United
States federal income tax and withholding tax purposes and shall not take any
position inconsistent with such treatment.

 



 

(c) As and when reasonably requested by Purchaser, the Company agrees to
provide prompt assistance in connection with determinations by Purchaser of
whether specified shares of Common Stock or shares of Preferred Stock that
Purchaser holds or has held constitute a "United States real property
interest" under Section 897 of the Code.

following notice from Purchaser requesting reimbursement thereof) reimburse
Purchaser for their reasonable out-of-pocket costs and expenses incurred in
connection with the evaluation (including due diligence), negotiation and
consummation of this Agreement and the other Transaction Documents and the
transactions contemplated hereby and thereby (including the transactions

legal and accounting advisors in connection with any of the foregoing and (b)
reimburse Purchaser for all filing fees under the HSR Act and other applicable
laws.

understandings, discussions and representations, oral or written, with respect
to such matters, which the parties acknowledge have been merged into such
documents, exhibits and schedules. At or after the Closing, and without
further consideration, the Company and Purchaser will execute and deliver to
the other such further documents as may be reasonably requested in order to
give practical effect to the intention of the parties under the Transaction
Documents.

6.4 _Amendments; Waivers; No Additional Consideration_. No provision of this
Agreement may be waived, modified, supplemented or amended except in a written
instrument signed, in the case of an amendment, by the Company and Purchaser
or, in the case of a waiver, by the party against whom enforcement of any such
waiver is sought. No waiver of any default with respect to any provision,
condition or requirement of this Agreement shall be deemed to be a continuing
waiver in the future or a waiver of any subsequent default or a waiver of any

the exercise of any such right.

 



      
 

 



 

6.5 _Construction; Interpretation_. The headings herein are for convenience
only, do not constitute a part of this Agreement and shall not be deemed to
limit or affect any of the provisions hereof. The language used in this
Agreement will be deemed to be the language chosen by the parties to express
their mutual intent, and no rules of strict construction will be applied
against any party. This Agreement shall be construed as if drafted jointly by
the parties, and no presumption or burden of proof shall arise favoring or
disfavoring any party by virtue of the authorship of any provisions of this
Agreement or any of the Transaction Documents. Unless otherwise indicated to
the contrary herein by the context or use thereof: (i) the words, "herein,"
"hereto," "hereof" and words of similar import refer to this Agreement as a
whole, including the Schedules and exhibits, and not to any particular
section, subsection, paragraph, subparagraph or clause contained in this
Agreement; (ii) masculine gender shall also include the feminine and neutral
genders, and vice versa; (iii) words importing the singular shall also include
the plural, and vice versa; (iv) the words "include," "includes" or
"including" shall be deemed to be followed by the words "without limitation";
(v) financial terms shall have the meanings given to such terms under GAAP
unless otherwise specified herein; (vi) references to "$" or "dollar" or "US$"
shall be references to United States dollars; (vi) where the context permits,
the use of the term "or" will be non-exclusive and equivalent to the use of
the term "and/or"; (vii) the word "extent" in the phrase "to the extent" shall
mean the degree to which a subject or other thing extends, and such phrase
shall not mean simply "if"; and (viii) if any action under this Agreement is
required to be done or taken on a day that is not a Business Day or on which a
government office is not open with respect to which a filing must be made,
then such action shall be required to be done or taken not on such day but on
the first succeeding Business Day thereafter.

 



 

6.6 _Successors and Assigns_. The provisions of this Agreement shall inure to
the benefit of and be binding upon the parties and their successors and
permitted assigns. This Agreement, or any rights or obligations hereunder, may
not be assigned by the Company without the prior written consent of Purchaser.
Purchaser may assign its rights hereunder in whole or in part to any Person to
whom Purchaser assigns or transfers any Securities in compliance with the
Transaction Documents and applicable law, provided such transferee shall agree
in writing to be bound, with respect to the transferred Securities, by the
terms and conditions of this Agreement that apply to the "Purchasers".

 



 

6.7 _No Third-Party Beneficiaries_. Except as set forth in _Section 6.13_ and
_Section 6.14_, this Agreement is intended for the benefit of the parties
hereto and their respective successors and permitted assigns and is not for
the benefit of and shall not confer any rights or remedies on, nor may any
provision hereof be enforced by, any other Person.

 



 

6.8 _Governing Law_. All questions concerning the construction, validity,
enforcement and interpretation of this Agreement shall be governed by and
construed and enforced in accordance with the internal laws of the State of
Delaware, without regard to the principles of conflicts of law thereof. Each
party agrees that all Proceedings concerning the interpretations, enforcement
and defense of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and any other
Transaction Documents (whether brought against a party hereto or its
respective Affiliates, employees or agents) shall be commenced exclusively in
the Delaware Courts. Each party hereto hereby irrevocably submits to the
exclusive jurisdiction of the Delaware Courts for the adjudication of any
dispute hereunder or in connection herewith or with any transaction
contemplated hereby or discussed herein (including with respect to the
enforcement of any of the Transaction Documents), and hereby irrevocably
waives, and agrees not to assert in any Proceeding, any claim that it is not
personally subject to the jurisdiction of any such Delaware Court, or that
such Proceeding has been commenced in an improper or inconvenient forum. Each
party hereto hereby irrevocably waives personal service of process and
consents to process being served in any such Proceeding by mailing a copy
thereof via registered or certified mail or overnight delivery (with evidence
of delivery) to such party at the address in effect for notices to it under
this Agreement and agrees that such service shall constitute good and
sufficient service of process and notice thereof. Nothing contained

 



      
 

 



 

herein shall be deemed to limit in any way any right to serve process in any
manner permitted by law. **EACH PARTY HERETO HEREBY IRREVOCABLY WAIVES, TO
THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, ANY AND ALL RIGHT TO TRIAL BY
JURY IN ANY LEGAL PROCEEDING ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT OR
THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY**.

 



 

6.9 _Survival_. Subject to applicable statute of limitations, the
representations, warranties, agreements and covenants contained herein shall
survive the Closing and the delivery of the Preferred Shares.

 



 

6.10 _Execution_. This Agreement may be executed in two or more counterparts,
all of which when taken together shall be considered one and the same
agreement and shall become effective when counterparts have been signed by
each party and delivered to the other party, it being understood that both
parties need not sign the same counterpart. In the event that any signature is
delivered by facsimile transmission, or by e-mail delivery of a ".pdf" format
data file, such signature shall create a valid and binding obligation of the
party executing (or on whose behalf such signature is executed) with the same
force and effect as if such facsimile signature page were an original thereof.

 



 

6.11 _Severability_. If any provision of this Agreement is held to be invalid
or unenforceable in any respect, the validity and enforceability of the
remaining terms and provisions of this Agreement shall not in any way be
affected or impaired thereby and the parties will attempt to agree upon a
valid and enforceable provision that is a reasonable substitute therefor, and
upon so agreeing, shall incorporate such substitute provision in this
Agreement.

 



 

6.12 _Remedies_. In addition to being entitled to exercise all rights provided
herein or granted by law, including recovery of damages, each of Purchaser and
the Company will be entitled to specific performance under the Transaction
Documents. The parties agree that monetary damages may not be adequate
compensation for any loss incurred by reason of any breach of obligations
described in the foregoing sentence and hereby agree to waive in any action
for specific performance of any such obligation (other than in connection with
any action for a temporary restraining order) the defense that a remedy at law
would be adequate.

 



 

6.13 _Limitation of Liability; No Recourse_.

 



 

(a) Notwithstanding anything that may be expressed or implied in this
Agreement, the liability of Purchaser hereunder shall be several, not joint
and several with any other purchaser of Preferred Stock, and under no
circumstance shall Purchaser be liable for any amounts hereunder or pursuant
to claims related to any breach or alleged breach of this Agreement in excess
of its Subscription Amount.

 



 

(b) Notwithstanding anything that may be expressed or implied in this
Agreement, and notwithstanding the fact that one or more Purchasers may be a
corporation, partnership, limited liability company or trust, the Company and
Purchaser covenant, agree and acknowledge that no recourse under this
Agreement, any Transaction Document or any other documents or instruments
delivered in connection with this Agreement shall be had against any current
or future Affiliate, director, officer, employee, general or limited partner,
stockholder, manager, member, trustee or control persons (as such term is used
in the Securities Act, as amended, and the rules and regulations thereunder)
of Purchaser or any director, officer, employee, general or limited partner,
stockholder, manager, member, trustee or control persons (as such term is used
in the Securities Act, as amended, and the rules and regulations thereunder),
Affiliate or assignee thereof (collectively, " _Purchaser Related Parties_ "),
whether by the enforcement of any assessment or by any legal or equitable
Proceeding, or by virtue of any statute,

 



      
 

 



 

regulation or other applicable law, it being expressly agreed and acknowledged
that no personal liability whatsoever shall attach to, be imposed on or
otherwise be incurred by any current or future officer, agent or employee of
Purchaser or any current or future director, officer, employee, general or
limited partner, stockholder, manager, member or trustee of Purchaser or of
any Affiliate or assignee thereof, as such for any obligation of Purchaser
under this Agreement, any Transaction Document or any other documents or
instruments delivered in connection with this Agreement for any claim based
on, in respect of or by reason of such obligations or their creation.

 



 

6.14 _Indemnification_. The Company will indemnify Purchaser and each
Purchaser Related Party to the full extent lawful against any and all claims
by any Person (including any stockholders of the Company), losses, fines and
expenses as incurred (including all reasonable fees and disbursements of any
such indemnitees counsel and other out-of-pocket expenses incurred in
connection with the investigation of and preparation for any such pending or
threatened claims and any litigation or other Proceedings arising therefrom)
arising in connection with this Agreement, the Acquisition Agreement, any of
the other Transaction Documents or any transactions contemplated hereby or
thereby (including the application for, receipt of or failure to receive
approvals of state public utility commissions or similar Governmental Entities
required by the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, including the issuance of the Conversion Shares (except to the
extent that such claim, loss, fine or expense results from the failure to
obtain approval by any state public utility commission that is required
because Purchaser elects to purchase additional Common Stock after the date
hereof (excluding the purchase of the Preferred Shares under this Agreement)
and such purchase results in the need for an approval that would not otherwise
be required)), or in connection with any action or failure to take any action
in connection therewith or any such indemnitee being a controlling person of a
Purchaser Related Party or any of its subsidiaries; _provided_ _,, however_ ,
there shall be excluded from such indemnification (a) any such claim, loss or
expense to the extent that it is based upon any action or failure to act by
such indemnitee that is found in a final judicial determination to constitute
gross negligence or intentional misconduct on such indemnitees part and (b)
any such claim, or loss or expense to the extent that it is based on such
claim, brought by the Company against Purchaser (but not on behalf of the
Company by any of its stockholders) for a breach of this Agreement by
Purchaser. The Company will advance costs and expenses, including attorneys
fees, incurred by any such indemnitee in defending any such claim in advance
of the final disposition of such claim upon receipt of an undertaking by or on
behalf of such indemnitee to repay amounts so advanced if it shall ultimately
be determined that such indemnitee is not entitled to be indemnified by the
Company pursuant to this Agreement.

 



 

6.15 _Termination_. This Agreement may be terminated and transactions
contemplated hereby abandoned at any time prior to the Closing: (a) by mutual
written consent of the Company and Purchaser, (b) by the Company or Purchaser
if the transactions contemplated by the Acquisition Agreement have not been
consummated by the earlier of (i) the date which is six (6) months plus 5
Business Days after the date hereof, or (ii) the date which is (A) the
"Longstop Date" (as defined in the Acquisition Agreement and after giving
effect to any extensions of time provided therein), plus (B) five (5) Business
Days (as defined in the Acquisition Agreement), plus (C) five (5) Business
Days, (c) by the Company or Purchaser if the Acquisition Agreement has been
terminated in accordance with its terms, or (d) by Purchaser if the Company or
any of its Affiliates institutes, directly or indirectly, any action,
litigation or other Proceeding against (i) Purchaser Related Parties in
connection with the transactions described in this Agreement or the
Transaction Documents or (ii) Purchaser in connection with the transactions
described in this Agreement, other than in the case of clause (ii), an action,
litigation or other Proceeding seeking to enforce this Agreement in accordance
with its terms. Nothing in this _Section 6.15_ shall be deemed to release any
party from any liability for any breach by such party of the terms and
provisions of this Agreement or the other Transaction Documents or to impair
the right of any party to compel specific performance by any other party of
its obligations under this Agreement or the other Transaction Documents, and
_Sections 6.13_ and _6.14_ shall survive the termination of this Agreement.

 



       
 

 



 

IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the parties hereto have caused this Amended and Restated
Securities Purchase Agreement to be duly executed by their respective
authorized signatories as of the date first indicated above.

CERTIFICATE OF THE DESIGNATIONS, 
POWERS, PREFERENCES AND RIGHTS 
OF ** 
** SERIES A CONVERTIBLE PARTICIPATING PREFERRED STOCK 
OF 
GTT COMMUNICATIONS, INC.

   

Pursuant to Section 151 of the General 
Corporation Law of the State of Delaware  

GTT Communications, Inc. (the " _Company_ "), a corporation organized and
existing under the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware, does
hereby certify that, pursuant to the authority conferred upon the board of
directors of the Company (the " _Board_ ") by its Second Amended and Restated
Certificate of Incorporation, as amended by that certain Certificate of
Amendment dated December 31, 2013 (as amended from time to time in accordance
with the terms hereof, hereinafter referred to as the " _Certificate of
Incorporation_ "), and pursuant to the provisions of Section 151 of the
General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware, the Board has duly approved
and adopted the following resolution:

 



 

"RESOLVED, that pursuant to the authority vested in the Board by the
provisions of the Certificate of Incorporation, there is hereby created, out
of the 5,000 shares of preferred stock, par value $0.0001 per share, of the
Company authorized in Article FOURTH of the Certificate of Incorporation (the
" _Preferred Stock_ "), a series of the Preferred Stock consisting of 250
shares, which series shall have the following powers, designations,
preferences and relative, participating, optional or other rights, and the
following qualifications, limitations and restrictions (in addition to any
powers, designations, preferences and relative, participating, optional or
other rights, and any qualifications, limitations and restrictions, set forth
in the Certificate of Incorporation which are applicable to the Preferred
Stock) (the " _Certificate of Designations_ "):

 



 

Section 1. _Designation and Amount; Rank_.

 



 

(a) The shares of such series of Preferred Stock shall be designated as
"Series A Convertible Participating Preferred Stock" (the " _Series A
Preferred Stock_"), par value $0.0001 per share, and the authorized number of
shares constituting such series shall be 250. The number of shares of Series A
Preferred Stock authorized may be increased or decreased by resolution of the
Board; _provided_ , that no decrease shall reduce the number of shares of
Series A Preferred Stock to less than that number of the shares then issued
and outstanding plus the number of shares of Series A Preferred Stock issuable
upon exercise of outstanding rights, options or warrants or upon conversion of
outstanding securities issued by the Company.

 



 

(b) The Series A Preferred Stock ranks, with respect to dividend rights and
rights upon any Liquidation:

      
 

 



 

(i) senior in preference and priority to the common stock of the Company, par
value $0.0001 per share (the " _Common Stock_ ") and each other class or
series of Equity Securities of the Company or series of Preferred Stock
hereafter created (collectively, with the Common Stock, the " _Junior
Securities_ "), in each case, other than Parity Securities and Senior
Securities;

 



 

(ii) on a parity with, without preference or priority, with any other class or
series of Equity Securities of the Company or series of Preferred Stock
hereafter created, in each case, that (x) have been approved by the requisite
holders of Series A Preferred Stock in accordance with Section 4(b) hereof and
otherwise not issued in violation of any of the provisions of this Certificate
of Designations, and (y) have terms which expressly provide that it shall rank
on parity, without preference or priority, with the Series A Preferred Stock
with respect to dividend rights or rights upon any Liquidation (collectively,
the " _Parity Securities_ "); _provided_ , _however_ , that any such class or
series that is issued in violation of the preceding clause (x) or do not have
the terms described in the preceding clause (y) shall be deemed to be Junior
Securities and not Parity Securities; and

 



 

(iii) junior in preference and priority to each other class or series of
Equity Security of the Company or series of Preferred Stock hereafter created,
in each case, that (x) have been approved by the requisite holders of Series A
Preferred Stock in accordance with Section 4(b) hereof and otherwise not
issued in violation of any of the provisions of this Certificate of
Designations, and (y) have terms which expressly provide that it shall rank
senior to the Series A Preferred Stock with respect to dividend rights or
rights upon any Liquidation (collectively, the " _Senior Securities_ ");
_provided_ , _however_ , that any such class or series that is issued in
violation of the preceding clause (x) or do not have the terms described in
the preceding clause (y) shall be deemed to be Junior Securities and not
Senior Securities.

 



 

Section 2. _Dividends_.

 



 

(a) _Series A Preferred Dividends_.

 



 

(i) In addition to any Participating Dividends payable pursuant to Section
2(b), each share of issued and outstanding Series A Preferred Stock shall
entitle its holder to receive, whether or not authorized or declared by the
Board and whether or not there are profits, surplus or other funds legally
available for the payment thereof, cumulative preferential dividends (the "
_Series A Preferred Dividends_") at a per annum rate equal to the Dividend
Rate on the Base Liquidation Preference of such share of Series A Preferred
Stock from the Original Issuance Date, accruing from the Original Issuance
Date and payable quarterly in arrears on each Regular Dividend Date (the
period commencing on the Original Issuance Date and ending on the first
Regular Dividend Date, and each period thereafter commencing on the day
immediately after a Regular Dividend Date and ending on the next Regular
Dividend Date being a " _Dividend Period_ "). The record date for each Series
A Preferred Dividend payable on a particular Regular Dividend Date shall be
the date that is fifteen (15) days prior to such Regular Dividend Date, unless
otherwise mutually agreed by the Company and the holders of a majority of the
Series A Preferred

 



      
 

 



 

Stock outstanding as of the relevant time (such record date, the " _Regular
Dividend Record Date_ "). Series A Preferred Dividends shall (x) be cumulative
from the Original Issuance Date, (y) accrue on a daily basis, whether or not
earned or declared, from and after the Original Issuance Date, and (z)
compound quarterly, as set forth in the preceding sentence, in each case
through the earliest to occur with respect to such share of Series A Preferred
Stock of (A) the Liquidation Date, (B) the Automatic Conversion Date or (C)
the Sale Date (to the extent such share of Series A Preferred Stock is Put
Preferred Stock), subject to extension as provided herein if the share of
Series A Preferred Stock is not repurchased (or, if applicable, any amounts
due upon Liquidation or on a Change of Control are not paid) or converted by
the Company (or the Successor, as applicable) on any such date. For the
avoidance of doubt, no Series A Preferred Dividends are payable in cash,
except that Accrued Dividends and Accumulated Dividends on any share of Series
A Preferred Stock shall be (i) paid upon redemption or repurchase of such
share when such redemption or repurchase is permitted or required hereunder or
upon Liquidation and (ii) be included in the applicable Base Liquidation
Preference for each share of Series A Preferred Stock for purposes of
calculating Participating Dividends.

 



 

(ii) The full amount of the applicable Series A Preferred Dividends accrued
for a Dividend Period shall automatically, without any action required by or
of the Company or the holders of the Series A Preferred Stock, (a) be deemed
to be included as Accumulated Dividends and thereby added to the applicable
Base Liquidation Preference as of the Regular Dividend Date that occurs at the
end of such Dividend Period, and (b) be deemed to be included as Accrued
Dividends and thereby added to the applicable Base Liquidation Preference as
of any date of determination that occurs prior to the Regular Dividend Date
that occurs at the end of such Dividend Period.

 



 

(iii) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, if any shares of Series
A Preferred Stock are converted into shares of Common Stock in accordance with
this Certificate of Designations on a Conversion Date that is during the
period between the close of business on any Regular Dividend Record Date and
the close of business on the corresponding Regular Dividend Date, the Accrued
Dividends with respect to such shares of Series A Preferred Stock as of such
Conversion Date shall, without any action required by the Company or the
holder of such Series A Preferred Stock, be deemed to be Accumulated Dividends
and shall be added to the applicable Base Liquidation Preference for purposes
of the conversion occurring on such Conversion Date. For the avoidance of
doubt, such Accrued Dividends shall include dividends accruing from, but not
including, the last Regular Dividend Date (or, if such Conversion Date is
prior to the first Regular Dividend Date, the Original Issuance Date) to, and
including, the applicable Conversion Date.

 



 

(iv) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, if any shares of Series
A Preferred Stock are repurchased by the Company in accordance with this
Certificate of Designations on a date during the period between the close of
business on any Regular Dividend Record Date and the close of business on the
corresponding Regular Dividend Date, the Accrued Dividends with respect to
such shares of Series A Preferred Stock as of such redemption or repurchase
date shall, without any action required by the Company or the holder of such
Series A Preferred Stock, be deemed to be Accumulated Dividends

 



      
 

 



 

and shall be added to the Base Liquidation Preference for purposes of such
redemption or repurchase. For the avoidance of doubt, such Accrued Dividends
shall include dividends accruing from, but not including, the last Regular
Dividend Date (or, if such redemption or repurchase occurs prior to the First
Regular Dividend Date, the Original Issuance Date) to, and including, the date
such shares of Series A Preferred Stock are otherwise repurchased in
accordance with this Certificate of Designations, as applicable.

 



 

(v) The applicable Series A Preferred Dividends for any period less than a
full Dividend Period shall be computed on the basis of a 360-day year of
twelve 30-day months and the actual number of days elapsed for any period of
less than one month.

 



 

(b) _Participating Dividends_.

 



 

(i) In the event any dividends are declared or paid or any other distribution
is made on or with respect to the Common Stock (which dividends and
distributions shall be subject to Section 4(b)(iv)), the holders of each share
of Series A Preferred Stock as of the record date established by the Board for
such dividend or distribution on the Common Stock shall be entitled to receive
as additional dividends (the " _Participating Dividends_ ") an amount (whether
in the form of cash, securities or other property) equal to the amount (and in
the form) of the dividends or distributions that such holder would have
received had such share of Series A Preferred Stock been converted as of the
date immediately prior to the record date of such dividend or distribution on
the Common Stock into the number of shares of Common Stock into which such
share of Series A Preferred Stock would have been convertible as of such date
(assuming such conversion was made pursuant to Section 5(a), without giving
effect to the Conversion Restrictions); _provided_ , _however_ , that
notwithstanding the foregoing, if the Company declares and pays a dividend or
makes a distribution on the Common Stock consisting in whole or in part of
Common Stock, then no such Participating Dividend shall be payable in respect
of the Series A Preferred Stock on account of the portion of such dividend or
distribution on the Common Stock that is payable in Common Stock and in lieu
thereof, the anti-dilution adjustment in Section 5(d)(i) shall apply;
_provided_ , _further_ , that if holders of a majority of the Series A
Preferred Stock then outstanding waive the right to receive such Participating
Dividends to be received in connection with or as part of a Fundamental
Corporate Transaction, Section 5(d)(iii) shall apply.

 



 

(ii) Participating Dividends are payable at the same time as and when such
dividend or other distribution on the Common Stock is paid to the holders of
Common Stock and no such dividend or distribution on Common Stock shall be
made unless and until the full amount of the Participating Dividends are paid
(or are concurrently being paid) to the holders of Series A Preferred Stock
pursuant to this Section 2(b). Prior to declaring any dividend or making any
distribution on or with respect to shares of Common Stock, the Company shall
take all prior corporate actions necessary to authorize the issuance of any
securities payable as a dividend in respect of the Series A Preferred Stock.

 



      
 

 



 

Section 3. _Liquidation_.

 



 

(a) Upon any liquidation, dissolution or winding-up of the Company, whether
voluntary or involuntary (each, but subject to Section 3(d), a " _Liquidation_
"), each share of Series A Preferred Stock entitles the holder thereof to
receive and to be paid out of the assets of the Company available for
distribution, before any distribution or payment may be made to, or set aside
for, a holder of any Junior Securities, an amount (the " _Liquidation
Preference_ ") in cash equal to, as of the date of payment in respect of such
Liquidation (the " _Liquidation Date_ ") the greater of:

 



 

(i) the Base Liquidation Preference _plus_ any Unpaid Dividends, in each case,
with respect to such share of Series A Preferred Stock and as of such
Liquidation Date; or

 



 

(ii) the Fair Market Value of the cash, securities and other property that the
holder of such share of Series A Preferred Stock would be entitled to receive
had such holder converted such share of Series A Preferred Stock into shares
of Common Stock in accordance with Section 5(a) (assuming the Stockholder
Approval had been obtained and without giving effect to any restrictions on
conversion contained herein or otherwise (collectively, the " _Conversion
Restrictions_ ")) immediately prior to such Liquidation Date (the amount set
forth in this clause (ii) being, with respect to such share of Series A
Preferred Stock, the " _As-Converted Per Share Amount_ ").

 



 

(b) If, upon any Liquidation, the assets of the Company available for
distribution are insufficient to pay the full Liquidation Preference for each
share of Series A Preferred Stock outstanding and the full liquidation
preference payable in respect of any outstanding shares of Parity Securities,
if any, the holders of Series A Preferred Stock and such Parity Securities
shall share ratably in any such distribution of the assets of the Company in
proportion to the full respective amounts to which they are entitled in the
Liquidation and no distribution or payment shall be made to a holder of any
Junior Securities in respect of such Junior Securities so held.

 



 

(c) Upon any Liquidation, after payment on each share of Series A Preferred
Stock of the full Liquidation Preference due thereon to the holder thereof,
the holders of Series A Preferred Stock as such shall have no right or claim
in respect of such Series A Preferred Stock so held to any of the remaining
assets (if any) of the Company available for distribution in respect of the
Junior Securities and such remaining assets, if any, shall be distributed,
subject to the rights of holders of any Equity Securities of the Company
ranking senior to the Common Stock as to liquidation or distributions, ratably
among the holders of Common Stock and any other Equity Securities of the
Company ranking on parity with the Common Stock as to distributions upon
Liquidation.

 



 

(d) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, unless the
holders of a majority of the then outstanding Series A Preferred Stock consent
in writing, none of the following shall constitute a Liquidation for purposes
hereof: (i) the sale, conveyance, exchange or transfer (for cash, shares of
stock, securities or other consideration) of all or substantially all or any
part of the property or assets of the Company, (ii) the merger, consolidation,
statutory exchange or any other business combination transaction of the
Company into or with any other Person or the merger, consolidation, statutory
exchange or any other business combination

 



       
 

 



 

transaction of any other Person into or with the Company, (iii) any Change of
Control, (iv) any Fundamental Corporate Transaction, or (v) the reduction,
reclassification or redemption of the Capital Stock of the Company.

 



 

(e) For the avoidance of doubt, to the extent that any of the Senior Credit
Facility Obligations are outstanding or any notes are outstanding under the HY
Indenture, in each case, as of the time of any Liquidation subject to this
Section 3, the entitlement set forth in Section 3(a) shall be subject to the
Senior Credit Facility Obligations or the principal of and interest and
premium on such notes, respectively, having been Paid in Full, and no payment
or distribution shall be made to any holder of Series A Preferred Stock in
accordance with Section 3(a) until after such time.

 



 

Section 4. _Voting Rights_.

 



 

(a) Except as expressly provided in Section 4(b) or as otherwise required by
the DGCL, the Series A Preferred Stock shall have no voting rights.

 



 

(b) So long as any shares of Series A Preferred Stock remain outstanding, in
addition to any other vote of stockholders of the Company required under
applicable law or the Certificate of Incorporation, the prior approval of
holders representing at least a majority of the then-outstanding shares of
Series A Preferred Stock, voting together as a separate class, shall be
required for the Company or any of its subsidiaries to take any action,
directly or indirectly, including in connection with a merger, consolidation,
reorganization or recapitalization, to:

 



 

(i) after the Original Issuance Date, (A) issue or cause the issuance of
additional shares of Series A Preferred Stock or (B) create, authorize or
issue (including by way of reclassification or otherwise) any obligation or
security convertible into, or exercisable or exchangeable for, or evidencing a
right to purchase any shares of Series A Preferred Stock;

 



 

(ii) authorize (or, if previously authorized, increase the authorized amount
of), create or issue (including by way of reclassification or otherwise) any
Senior Securities or Parity Securities or any obligation or security
convertible into, or exercisable or exchangeable for, or evidencing a right to
purchase any Senior Securities or Parity Securities;

 



 

(iii) alter, amend, change, repeal or waive any provision of the Certificate
of Incorporation or Bylaws of the Company (or similar organizational documents
of any of its subsidiaries) in a manner that, individually or in the
aggregate, would adversely affect, alter, change or modify the rights,
preferences, privileges or powers of the holders of Series A Preferred Stock
(it being understood that any such alteration, amendment, change, repeal or
waiver in order to authorize, create or issue Equity Securities not expressly
requiring approval of the holders of Series A Preferred Stock pursuant to the
preceding clauses (i) and (ii) shall not be deemed to adversely affect, alter,
change or modify the rights, preferences, privileges or powers of the holders
of Series A Preferred Stock);

 



      
 

 



 

(iv) declare or pay any dividends on any Capital Stock of the Company or
repurchase any Capital Stock of the Company (it being understood, in each
case, that the reference to the "Company" herein is exclusively to the Company
unless and until the Reorganization, in which case such reference shall be
exclusively to the holding company formed as a result thereof) other than (A)
repurchases of, and dividends declared and paid on, the Series A Preferred
Stock in accordance with the terms of this Certificate of Designations, (B)
following the Reorganization, dividends declared and paid solely in the form
of Junior Securities (it being understood that any dividends paid to implement
a Distribution Transaction shall not constitute a dividend declared in the
form of Junior Securities and therefore a Distribution Transaction shall be
subject to the prior approval of the Series A Preferred Stock in accordance
with this Section 4(b)) and in full compliance with the terms hereof,
including Section 2 and Section 5; (C) repurchases (or deemed repurchases) of
Common Stock pursuant to plans approved by the Board pursuant to which shares
of Common Stock or options to purchase Common Stock are issued to employees,
officers, directors and consultants of the Company and (D) following the
Reorganization, dividends on Senior Securities;

 



 

(v) amend, restate, supplement, modify or replace the Debt Financing Documents
in any manner or enter into any agreements or arrangements relating to
indebtedness or otherwise containing provisions, in each case, that would (A)
restrict the Company from including any Series A Preferred Dividends accrued
for a Dividend Period in Accumulated Dividends and thereby adding them to the
applicable Base Liquidation Preference pursuant to Section 2(a)(ii), (B)
impair the ability of any holder of Series A Preferred Stock to exercise any
right with respect to such Series A Preferred Stock under Section 3 or Section
7 or to receive the benefit thereof (in each case, to a greater extent than is
currently provided for in the Debt Financing Documents) or (C) enable the
Company to pay dividends on Junior Securities prior to and in preference over
the Series A Preferred Stock;

 



 

(vi) enter into any transaction that would be required to be disclosed by the
Company pursuant to Item 404 of Regulation S-K promulgated under the Exchange
Act (whether or not such Item is applicable to the Company and whether or not
in the current fiscal year or in any future fiscal year) it being acknowledged
and agreed that the holders of Series A Preferred Stock will not unreasonably
withhold, condition or delay their approval of any such transaction;

 



 

(vii) become a party to, adopt or otherwise become subject to, a stockholders
rights agreement, "poison pill" or similar anti-takeover agreement or plan (a
" _Rights Plans_ ") unless (x) such Rights Plan would not be applicable to the
holders of Series A Preferred Stock (or the Primary Investor and its
Affiliates), including any shares of Common Stock received upon conversion of
the Series A Preferred Stock, or (y) the Company has excluded the Primary
Investor and its Affiliates from the definition of "acquiring person" (or such
similar term) as such term is defined in the Rights Plan; or

 



 

(viii) enter into any contract, agreement, commitment or understanding to do
any of the foregoing actions set forth in clause (b)(i) through (b)(vii),
unless such contract, agreement, commitment or understanding expressly
provides that the

 



      
 

 



 

Companys obligation to undertake any of the foregoing is subject to the prior
approval of the holders of a majority of the then outstanding shares of Series
A Preferred Stock.

 



 

(c) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, the Company may, at its
sole discretion, effect the Reorganization at any time without the prior
approval of any holder of Series A Preferred Stock.

 



 

Section 5. _Conversion_. Each share of Series A Preferred Stock is convertible
into shares of Common Stock as provided in, and subject to the terms and
conditions of, this Certificate of Designations (including this Section 5).

 



 

(a) _Conversion_.

 



 

(i) Each holder of Series A Preferred Stock shall have the right, at any time
and from time to time following the date that is one (1) year from the date
hereof and following receipt of HSR Clearance, if applicable, at such holders
option, to convert all or any portion of such holders shares of Series A
Preferred Stock (the " _Optional Conversion Right_ ") into a number of duly
authorized, validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable shares of Common
Stock per share of Series A Preferred Stock equal to the amount determined by
dividing (i) the Base Liquidation Preference plus any Unpaid Dividends, in
each case, with respect to such share of Series A Preferred Stock to be
converted by such holder exercising the Optional Conversion Right by (ii) the
Conversion Price (the " _Optional Conversion Date_ ") of the Optional
Conversion Notice (as defined below), with such adjustment or cash payment for
fractional shares as the Company may elect pursuant to Section 5(b),
_provided_ that the Optional Conversion Right shall not be exercisable (A) by
any holder of Series A Preferred Stock who is classified as a "substantial
security holder" of the Company under Rule 312.03 of the NYSE Listed Company
Manual or any successor rule to the extent that the aggregate number of shares
of Common Stock issued pursuant to the exercise of the Optional Conversion
Right exceeds (I) 0.99% of the number of issued and outstanding shares of
Common Stock as of the measurement date required under Rule 312.03 of the NYSE
Listed Company Manual or any successor rule if the Conversion Price is less
than the book or market value of the Common Stock (as determined in accordance
with Rule 312.03 of the NYSE Listed Company Manual or any successor rule) as
of the Signing Date, or (II) 4.99% of the number of issued and outstanding
shares of Common Stock as of the measurement date required under Rule 312.03
of the NYSE Listed Company Manual or any successor rule if the Conversion
Price is at least as great as each of the book and market value of the Common
Stock (as determined in accordance with Rule 312.03 of the NYSE Listed Company
Manual or any successor rule) as of the Signing Date, or (B) if such
conversion would otherwise require approval of the Companys stockholders
pursuant to Rule 312.03 of the NYSE Listed Company Manual or any successor
rule. The Optional Conversion Right shall be exercised by a holder by (x) if
applicable, surrendering the certificates representing the shares of Series A
Preferred Stock to be converted, free of any adverse interest or liens (other
than, if applicable, those contemplated by the Transaction Agreements or
applicable state and/or federal securities laws), at the office of the
Companys transfer agent for the Series A Preferred Stock (or at the principal
office of the Company, if the Company serves as its own transfer agent),

 



      
 

 



 

accompanied by customary transfer instruments, and (y) delivering at the
office of the Companys transfer agent for the Series A Preferred Stock (or at
the principal office of the Company, if the Company serves as its own transfer
agent) written notice stating that such holder elects to convert all or a
portion of such holders shares of Series A Preferred Stock and specifying the
name(s) in which the shares of Common Stock issuable pursuant to such
conversion are to be issued (the " _Optional Conversion Notice_ ").

 



 

(ii) Upon receipt of the Applicable Approvals, each share of Series A
Preferred Stock outstanding immediately prior to receipt of the last
Applicable Approval to be obtained shall automatically, without further action
by the holder thereof or the Company, be converted into, a number of duly
authorized, validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable shares of Common
Stock per share of Series A Preferred Stock equal to the amount determined by
dividing (i) the Base Liquidation Preference plus any Unpaid Dividends, in
each case, with respect to such share of Series A Preferred Stock to be
converted as of the Automatic Conversion Date by (ii) the Conversion Price,
with such adjustment or cash payment for fractional shares as the Company may
elect pursuant to Section 5(b) (the " _Automatic Conversion_ ").
Notwithstanding the foregoing, each share of Series A Preferred Stock held as
of November 14, 2018 by a holder who is not classified as a "substantial
security holder" of the Company under Rule 312.03 of the NYSE Listed Company
Manual or any successor rule and who could convert all of such holders shares
of Series A Preferred Stock on such date by delivery of an Optional Conversion
Notice (the " _Minority Conversion Trigger_ "), shall automatically, without
further action by the holder thereof or the Company, be converted into a
number of duly authorized, validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable shares
of Common Stock per share of Series A Preferred Stock equal to the amount
determined by dividing (i) the Base Liquidation Preference plus any Unpaid
Dividends, in each case, with respect to such share of Series A Preferred
Stock to be converted as of such date by (ii) the Conversion Price, with such
adjustment or cash payment for fractional shares as the Company may elect
pursuant to Section 5(b), on such date.

 



 

(b) _Fractional Shares_. No fractional shares of Common Stock shall be issued
upon conversion of the Series A Preferred Stock. In lieu of fractional shares,
the Company may elect to either make a cash payment to a holder of Series A
Preferred Stock that would otherwise be entitled to a fractional share (based
on the Conversion Price of such fractional share) or, in lieu of such cash
payment, round up to the next whole share the number of shares of Common Stock
to be issued to any holder of Series A Preferred Stock upon conversion. The
number of full shares of Common Stock issuable upon conversion shall be
calculated on the basis of the aggregate number of shares of Series A
Preferred Stock converted for each holder at such time.

 



 

(c) _Mechanics of Conversion_.

 



 

(i) Promptly upon receipt of the last Applicable Approval to be obtained, or
upon the Minority Conversion Trigger, as applicable, the Company shall send
the relevant holders of record of shares of Series A Preferred Stock written
notice that the conversion of the applicable shares of Series A Preferred
Stock has occurred, the number of shares of Common Stock into which such
holders Series A Preferred Stock have converted and the manner in which the
Company elects to treats fractional shares under

 



      
 

 



 

Section 5(b). Upon receipt of such notice, each such holder of shares of
Series A Preferred Stock shall, if applicable, surrender the certificates
representing such shares of Series A Preferred Stock, accompanied by customary
transfer instruments reasonably satisfactory to the Company or the Companys
transfer agent, free of any adverse interest or liens (other than, if
applicable, those contemplated by the Transaction Agreements or applicable
state and/or federal securities laws), at the office of the Companys transfer
agent for the Series A Preferred Stock (or at the principal office of the
Company, if the Company serves as its own transfer agent).

 



 

(ii) As soon as practicable after a Conversion Date, and in any event within
three (3) Business Days after such Conversion Date (or on such Conversion Date
if necessary to participate in any Change of Control or Fundamental Corporate
Transaction), the Company shall promptly issue and deliver to such holder a
certificate for the number of shares of Common Stock to which such holder is
entitled (or, if the Common Stock is not certificated at such time, the
Company shall take all other action as is necessary to deliver such shares of
Common Stock to such holder using "book-entry" procedures or otherwise,
including by obtaining and delivering any necessary legal opinions to the
transfer agent to assure that such stock certificates are issued or such
"book-entry" procedures are complied with), together with a check or cash for
payment of (1) fractional shares, if any as determined under Section 5(b), in
exchange for the certificates formerly representing shares of Series A
Preferred Stock and (2) any Unpaid Dividends (and if any portion of the Unpaid
Dividends was not a cash dividend, together with the property constituting
such non-cash Unpaid Dividends) on such share of Series A Preferred Stock. In
the case of the Automatic Conversion, such conversion shall be deemed to have
been made upon receipt of the last Applicable Approval to be obtained, and the
Person entitled to receive the shares of Common Stock issuable upon the
Automatic Conversion shall be treated for all purposes as the record holder of
such shares of Common Stock from and after receipt of the last Applicable
Approval to be obtained. The Company shall pay any documentary, stamp or
similar issue or transfer tax due on the issue of Common Stock upon
conversion. The Company shall, at its own cost and expense, take all actions
to effect such conversion in accordance with the terms hereof.

 



 

(iii) The Company shall at all times reserve and keep available, free from any
preemptive rights, out of its treasury or authorized but unissued shares of
Common Stock for the purpose of effecting the conversion of the Series A
Preferred Stock 110% of the number of shares of Common Stock deliverable upon
the conversion of all outstanding Series A Preferred Stock (as adjusted from
time to time pursuant to this Section 5), and the Company shall take all
actions required to amend its Certificate of Incorporation to increase the
authorized amount of Common Stock if necessary therefor. Before taking any
action which would cause an adjustment reducing the Conversion Price below the
then par value of the shares of Common Stock issuable upon conversion of the
Series A Preferred Stock, the Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to
take any and all corporate actions which may, in the opinion of its counsel,
be necessary in order that the Company may validly and legally issue fully
paid and nonassessable shares of Common Stock at such adjusted Conversion
Price.

 



      
 

 



 

(iv) From and after receipt of the last Applicable Approval to be obtained, or
the Minority Conversion Trigger, as applicable, the applicable shares of
Series A Preferred Stock shall no longer be deemed to be outstanding, and all
rights of each holder thereof as a holder of Series A Preferred Stock (except
the right to receive from the Company the Common Stock, and, if applicable,
any cash in lieu of fractional shares and/or any Unpaid Dividend (and if any
portion of the Unpaid Dividends was not a cash dividend, the property
constituting such non-cash Unpaid Dividends upon conversion) shall cease and
terminate with respect to such shares; _provided_ , that in the event that a
share of Series A Preferred Stock is not converted because of a default by the
Company or because the Company is otherwise unable to issue the requisite
shares of Common Stock, such share of Series A Preferred Stock shall remain
outstanding and shall be entitled to all of the rights provided herein
(including the right to dividends, including any increase that occurs in the
Base Liquidation Preference until such default or other impediment is cured or
removed) until such default or other impediment is cured or removed. Any
shares of Series A Preferred Stock that have been converted shall, after such
conversion, be deemed cancelled and retired and, following the filing of any
certificate required by the DGCL, have the status of authorized but unissued
Preferred Stock, without designation as to series until such shares are again
designated as part of a particular series by the Board.

 



 

(d) _Adjustments_. The Conversion Rate shall be subject to adjustment from
time to time as follows:

 



 

(i) _Upon Stock Dividends, Subdivisions or Splits_. If, at any time after the
Original Issuance Date, the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding is
increased by a stock dividend payable in shares of Common Stock or by a
subdivision or split-up of shares of Common Stock (other than upon a
Fundamental Corporate Transaction constituting a consolidation or merger to
which Section 5(d)(iii) applies), then, immediately following the record date
for the determination of holders of Common Stock entitled to receive such
stock dividend, or to be affected by such subdivision or split-up, the
Conversion Rate shall be appropriately increased (and thereby resulting in a
decrease in the Conversion Price) by multiplying the Conversion Rate as in
effect immediately prior to such adjustment by a fraction, the numerator of
which is the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding immediately after
such increase and the denominator of which is the number of shares of Common
Stock immediately prior to such increase.

 



 

(ii) _Upon Combinations or Reverse Stock Splits_. If, at any time after the
Original Issuance Date, the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding is
decreased by a combination or reverse stock split of the outstanding shares of
Common Stock into a smaller number of shares of Common Stock (other than upon
a Fundamental Corporate Transaction constituting a consolidation or merger to
which Section 5(d)(iii) applies), then, immediately following the record date
to determine shares affected by such combination or reverse stock split, the
Conversion Rate shall be appropriately decreased (and thereby resulting in an
increase in the Conversion Price) by multiplying the Conversion Rate as in
effect immediately prior to such adjustment by a fraction, the numerator of
which is the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding immediately

 



      
 

 



 

after such increase and the denominator of which is the number of shares of
Common Stock immediately prior to such increase.

 



 

(iii) _Upon Reclassifications, Reorganizations, Consolidations or Mergers_. In
the event of any reorganization of the Company or any reclassification of the
stock of the Company (other than a reorganization or reclassification (x)
where there is no change in or distribution with respect to Common Stock or
(y) which constitutes solely a stock dividend or subdivision, split-up,
reverse stock split or combination solely of or involving solely shares of
Common Stock), any consolidation or merger of the Company with or into another
Person (where the Company is not the surviving Person or involving a change in
or distribution with respect to the Common Stock), or sale or other transfer
of the assets of the Company to another Person (involving a change in or
distribution with respect to the Common Stock) which, in any such case, does
not constitute a Change of Control (any such reorganization, reclassification,
consolidation, merger or transfer, a " _Fundamental Corporate Transaction_ "),
each share of Series A Preferred Stock, immediately after such Fundamental
Corporate Transaction, shall (1) if the Company is the surviving Person in
such Fundamental Corporate Transaction, remain outstanding or be exchanged for
an equivalent share of preferred stock governed by the terms of this
Certificate of Designations or (2) if the Company is not the surviving Person
in such Fundamental Corporate Transaction, be converted or exchanged into a
security of the successor Person in such Fundamental Corporate Transaction
having rights, powers and preferences as nearly equivalent as permissible
under applicable law to those provided in this Certificate of Designations
(with such adjustments as are appropriate to place the holders of Series A
Preferred Stock in as nearly equivalent a position as permissible under
applicable law following such Fundamental Corporate Transaction as compared to
immediately prior to such Fundamental Corporate Transaction); _provided_ that,
immediately following such Fundamental Corporate Transaction, each such share
of Series A Preferred Stock or other security (as applicable) shall be
convertible into the kind and number of shares of stock or other securities or
other property (including cash) of the Company or of the successor Person
resulting from such Fundamental Corporate Transaction or to which such assets
are transferred, if any, to which a holder of such share of Series A Preferred
Stock would have been entitled upon such Fundamental Corporate Transaction
assuming such share of Series A Preferred Stock had been converted pursuant to
Section 5(a) into shares of Common Stock immediately prior to such Fundamental
Corporate Transaction (without giving effect to the Conversion Restrictions);
_provided_ , that any property (including cash) other than shares of stock or
other securities to be received as a dividend or other distribution on (but
not involving a change in) shares of Common Stock in conjunction with or as
part of such Fundamental Corporate Transaction (such other property (including
cash so to be received as a distribution), unless waived as specified below,
being a " _Special Distribution_ ") shall, unless waived by the holders of a
majority of the Series A Preferred Stock then outstanding (in which case the
holders of Series A Preferred Stock shall be entitled to such property
(including cash) upon conversion of such Series A Preferred Stock), be payable
immediately upon consummation of such Fundamental Corporate Transaction upon
each share of Series A Preferred Stock (in the amount and form that such
holder would have received had such share been converted pursuant to Section
5(a) as of the date immediately prior to the record date for such dividend or
distribution into the

 



      
 

 



 

number of shares of Common Stock into which such share of Series A Preferred
Stock is convertible (without giving effect to the Conversion Restrictions))
and following such payment such share of Series A Preferred Stock shall not be
entitled to any such amounts upon conversion of such share of Series A
Preferred Stock; _provided_ , _further_ , that if stockholders are offered an
election to receive cash, stock, other property or some combination thereof in
connection with such Fundamental Corporate Transaction, (A) the election to
determine the kind and number of shares of stock or other securities or other
property into which shares of Series A Preferred Stock shall thereafter be
convertible (or, in the case of property (including cash) other than shares of
stock or other securities, paid immediately as a Special Distribution) shall
be offered to each holder of Series A Preferred Stock, subject to any
limitations applicable to all holders of Common Stock, including any
provisions applicable to oversubscription of any form of consideration, in
which case, to the extent any holders of Series A Preferred Stock have elected
the oversubscribed form of consideration, the type of such oversubscribed
consideration shall be reduced among all holders of Common Stock and Series A
Preferred Stock on a pro rata basis as determined based on each such so
electing stockholders ownership (or, in the case of the Series A Preferred
Stock, aggregate deemed ownership on an as-converted basis (without giving
effect to the Conversion Restrictions) of shares of Common Stock and the
balance in the other form of consideration; (B) then following such
Fundamental Corporate Transaction, each share of Series A Preferred Stock,
regardless of the particular election made by the holder thereof, shall,
immediately after such Fundamental Corporate Transaction, be convertible (x)
into the kind and number of shares of stock or other securities or other
property (other than in the case of property (including cash) paid as a
Special Distribution) and/or (y) in the case of such other property (including
cash) so to be paid, unless waived as aforesaid, be paid a Special
Distribution constituting the kind and amount of property (including cash) to
which a holder of a number of shares of Common Stock so deliverable upon
conversion of the Series A Preferred Stock would so have been entitled based
upon the election made by such holder of Series A Preferred Stock (subject to
any pro rata adjustment for any oversubscribed form of consideration described
in the preceding clause (A)); and (C) that such right of election shall be
subject to, and not in limitation of, and no procedures shall be required of a
holder of Series A Preferred Stock in connection with any such election which
would limit, the other rights of the holders of the Series A Preferred Stock
set forth herein). This Section 5(d)(iii) shall similarly apply to successive
Fundamental Corporate Transactions. The Company shall not effect any
Fundamental Corporate Transaction unless, prior to the consummation thereof,
the successor Person (if other than the Company) resulting from such
Fundamental Corporate Transaction, shall assume, by written instrument in form
and substance satisfactory to the holders of Series A Preferred Stock, the
obligation to deliver to the holders of the Series A Preferred Stock such
shares of stock, securities or other property (including cash), which, in
accordance with the foregoing provisions (including with respect to payment of
any Special Distribution), such holders shall be entitled to receive upon such
conversion (or, as to any Special Distribution, be paid immediately upon
consummation of such Fundamental Corporate Transaction), which instrument
shall also provide that the obligations of the Company (or such successor
Person) and the rights, powers and preferences applicable to the Series A
Preferred Stock and the holders thereof in respect of such shares of stock,
securities or other property

 



      
 

 



 

(including cash) shall be as nearly equivalent as permissible under applicable
law to the obligations of the Company and rights, powers and preferences
applicable to the Series A Preferred Stock and the holders thereof (including
adjustments which, for events subsequent to the effective date of such written
instrument, shall be as nearly equivalent as permissible under applicable law
to the adjustments provided for in this Section 5). The Company shall not
effect a Fundamental Corporate Transaction prior to effecting the
Reorganization.

 



 

(iv) _Minimum Adjustment_. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Conversion Rate
shall not be adjusted if the amount of such adjustment would be an amount less
than one millionth of a share of Common Stock, but any such amount shall be
carried forward and adjustment with respect thereto shall made at the time
that such amount, together with any subsequent amounts so carried forward,
aggregates to one millionth of a share of Common Stock or more.

 



 

(v) _Rules of Calculation; Treasury Stock_. All calculations shall be made to
the nearest one-hundredth of a cent or to the nearest one millionth of a
share. The number of shares of Common Stock outstanding shall be calculated on
the basis of the number of issued and outstanding shares of Common Stock, not
including shares held in the treasury of the Company. The Company shall not
pay any dividend on or make any distribution to shares of Common Stock held in
treasury.

 



 

(vi) _Waiver_. Notwithstanding the foregoing, prior to any increase to the
Conversion Rate that is otherwise provided in this Section 5, no such increase
shall be made if the Company receives, prior to the effective time of such
increase, written notice from the holders representing at least a majority of
the then-outstanding shares of Series A Preferred Stock, voting together as a
separate class, that no increase is to be made as the result of a particular
issuance of Common Stock or other dividend or distribution on shares of Common
Stock. This waiver shall be limited in scope and shall not be valid for any
issuance of Common Stock or other dividend or distribution on shares of Common
Stock not specifically provided for in such notice.

 



 

(vii) _Par Value_. Anything in this Section 5 notwithstanding, no adjustment
to the Conversion Rate shall reduce the Conversion Price below the then par
value per share of Common Stock, and any such purported adjustment shall
instead adjust the Conversion Rate to yield a Conversion Price to such par
value.

 



 

(viii) _No Duplication_. If any action would require adjustment of the
Conversion Rate pursuant to more than one of the provisions described in this
Section 5 in a manner such that such adjustments are duplicative, only one
adjustment shall be made.

 



 

(ix) _Statement on Certificates_. Irrespective of any adjustment in the
Conversion Rate or amount or kind of shares of stock, securities or other
property into which the shares of Series A Preferred Stock are convertible,
Series A Preferred Stock certificates theretofore issued or thereafter issued
may continue to express the same Conversion Rate initially applicable or
amount or kind of shares of Common Stock initially issuable upon conversion of
the shares of Series A Preferred Stock evidenced

 



      
 

 



 

thereby pursuant to this Section 5, it being understood that any statement
with respect to the foregoing matters on any such certificate shall not
prejudice the actual rights of an holder of Series A Preferred Stock
(including with respect to any prior or future adjustment in the Conversion
Rate) as set forth in this Section 5.

 



 

(x) _Other Actions_. If the Company takes any action after the Original
Issuance Date that affects the Common Stock that would be covered by this
Section 5(d), but for the manner in which such action is taken or structured,
which would in any way diminish the value of the Series A Preferred Stock
(including the value of the Series A Preferred Stock when determined on an as-
converted basis (without giving effect to the Conversion Restrictions)), then
the Conversion Rate shall be increased (and the Conversion Price shall be
decreased) in such manner as is equitable under the circumstances as
determined in good faith by the Board, in consultation with the Primary
Investor; _provided_ that the Company shall not, prior to the Reorganization,
take any such action that it would have been prohibited to take prior to the
Reorganization, but for the manner in which such action is taken or
structured.

 



 

(e) _Certificate of Adjustments_. Upon the occurrence of each adjustment or
readjustment of the Conversion Rate pursuant to this Section 5, the Company
shall, at its expense, as promptly as reasonably practicable compute such
adjustment or readjustment in accordance with the terms hereof and furnish to
each holder of Series A Preferred Stock a certificate, signed by an officer of
the Company, setting forth such adjustment or readjustment and showing in
detail the facts upon which such adjustment or readjustment is based, and
shall file a copy of such certificate with its corporate records. The Company
shall, upon the reasonable written request of any holder of Series A Preferred
Stock, furnish to such holder a similar certificate setting forth (i) the
calculation of such adjustments and readjustments in reasonable detail, (ii)
the Conversion Rate then in effect, and (iii) the number of shares of Common
Stock and the amount, if any, of Capital Stock, other securities or other
property (including but not limited to cash and evidences of indebtedness)
which then would be received upon the conversion of Series A Preferred Stock
(without giving effect to the Conversion Restrictions).

 



 

Section 6. _Redemption_. The Series A Preferred Stock is not redeemable;
provided, however, this Section 6 shall not preclude a redemption or
repurchase of Series A Preferred Stock based upon a mutual agreement of the
Company and a holder of Series A Preferred Stock.

 



 

Section 7. _Effect of Change of Control_.

 



 

(a) _Holders Put Option Upon Change of Control_. In the event that a Change of
Control shall occur at any time while any shares of Series A Preferred Stock
are outstanding (the date of such occurrence, the " _Sale Date_ "), each
holder of outstanding shares of Series A Preferred Stock shall have the
option, subject to the satisfaction of the COC Put Conditions, to require the
Company, or the Survivor of the Change of Control (the Company or such
Survivor, as applicable, the " _Successor_ ") to purchase (a " _Change of
Control Put_ ") any or all of its shares of Series A Preferred Stock (the
shares of Series A Preferred Stock that are subject to the exercise of a
Change of Control Put, being the " _Put Preferred Stock_ ") at a purchase
price per share of Put

 



       
 

 



 

Preferred Stock, payable in cash equal to the greater of (with respect to such
share of Series A Preferred Stock, the " _Change of Control Purchase Price_
"):

 



 

(i) the Base Liquidation Preference _plus_ any Unpaid Dividends, in each case,
with respect to such share of Series A Preferred Stock as of the applicable
Sale Date; or

 



 

(ii) the product of (x) the number of shares of Common Stock that such share
of Series A Preferred Stock would be converted into (without giving effect to
the Conversion Restrictions) had such share of Series A Preferred Stock been
so converted under Section 5(a) immediately prior to such Sale Date and had a
right to participate fully along with the Common Stock in such Change of
Control and (y) the COC Common Stock Value (the amount set forth in this
clause (ii) with respect to such share of Series A Preferred Stock, being the
" _As-Converted COC Per Share Amount_ "),

 



 

 _provided_ that, prior to the Reorganization, Section 5(a)(ii) shall be
disregarded and the Change of Control Purchase Price shall equal the amount
set forth in Section 5(a)(i) until such time as the Reorganization is
effected.

 



 

(b) If either the applicable Change of Control occurs prior to the
Reorganization or a majority of the holders of the Put Preferred Stock (as
determined at least two Trading Days prior to the Sale Date) consent in
writing to a determination by the Company that the As-Converted COC Per Share
Amount is not greater than the amount set forth in clause (i) of the
definition of Change of Control Purchase Price and will therefore not be used
in determining the Change of Control Purchase Price in connection with such
Change of Control (a " _Put Convert Consent_ "), then the Change of Control
Purchase Price with respect to such share of Put Preferred Stock shall be paid
in full in cash to each holder of Put Preferred Stock on the Sale Date and
prior to or concurrently with any payments or distributions to the holders of
Common Stock in connection with such Change of Control; _provided_ that the
Change of Control Purchase Price shall not be paid unless and until the COC
Put Conditions are satisfied. However, if the applicable Change of Control
occurs following the Reorganization and a Put Convert Consent is not received
by the Company prior to the Sale Date, then the amount set forth in clause (i)
of the definition of Change of Control Purchase Price shall be paid in cash
(and with respect to any Unpaid Dividend described therein that is not a cash
dividend, in the form and amount of such non-cash dividend) to each holder of
Put Preferred Stock on the Sale Date and prior to or concurrently with any
payments or distributions to the holders of Common Stock in connection with
such Change of Control (any payment made on the Sale Date, whether pursuant to
the first or second sentence of this Section 7(b), the " _Change of Control
Initial Payment_ "); _provided_ , _however_ , that to the extent it is
determined following the thirty (30) consecutive Trading Days following a
Change of Control that the As-Converted COC Per Share Amount exceeds the
Change of Control Initial Payment, then the Successor shall, within three (3)
Business Days of such determination, pay to each holder of Put Preferred Stock
the amount of such excess (the " _Change of Control Excess Amount_ ") in cash
or, if the consideration paid to the holders of Common Stock in such Change of
Control includes, in whole or in part, Freely Marketable Securities, then in
the Successors sole discretion, in any combination of cash or such Freely
Marketable Securities (with the Freely Marketable Securities valued for such
purpose at the Fair Market Value as determined on the Trading Day that is the
fifteenth (15th) Trading Day immediately following such Sale Date

 



      
 

 



 

 _provided_ , _further_ , that the Change of Control Purchase Price shall not
be paid unless and until the COC Put Conditions are satisfied.

 



 

(c) As soon as practicable after the announcement of any transaction or the
execution of any agreement providing for a Change of Control (or on any other
date in which the Company learns that a Change of Control is reasonably
expected to occur), the Company shall deliver a notice (the " _Change of
Control Notice_ ") addressed to the holders of record of the Series A
Preferred Stock as they appear in the records of the Company as of the date of
such notice; _provided_ , that any Change of Control Notice delivered in
connection with any Change of Control involving a merger, sale, share
exchange, consolidation, reorganization, recapitalization or other transaction
or series of transactions in which the stockholders are offered an election to
receive cash, stock or some combination thereof in connection with such Change
of Control shall be delivered by the Successor no later than ten (10) Business
Days prior to the final date such election may be made. Each notice must
state: (A) the expected Sale Date (and the expected Change of Control Purchase
Price as of such date (it being understood that the actual Change of Control
Purchase Price shall be determined as of the actual Sale Date)); (B) the name
of the paying agent to whom, and the address of the place where, the shares of
Series A Preferred Stock shall be surrendered for payment of the Change of
Control Purchase Price in the event of any Change of Control Put is exercised
and a Sale Date occurs; (C) that the Change of Control Put shall be subject to
the consummation of the Change of Control; (D) the circumstances and material
facts regarding such Change of Control; and (E) information regarding the
expected ability to satisfy the COC Put Conditions and the manner in which the
COC Put Conditions will be so satisfied on or prior to the Sale Date and prior
to any distribution, payment or economic value being delivered to the holders
of Common Stock in connection with such Change of Control.

 



 

(d) To the extent that the Successor has insufficient funds to repurchase or
redeem all of the Put Preferred Stock which are required to be redeemed in
cash pursuant to this Section 7, the Successor shall use available funds to
redeem a pro rata portion of the Put Preferred Stock held by each holder
thereof and such repurchase or redemption, as applicable, shall be subject to
Section 7(e)(iii) and (v); _provided_ , that the Company shall not voluntarily
effect any Change of Control, or voluntarily permit any Change of Control to
be effected (x) if any value is being ascribed to the shares of Common Stock
unless the COC Put Conditions will be satisfied at or prior to the Sale Date
or (y) to the extent the Company or the Successor would have insufficient
funds to repurchase or redeem, as applicable, all of the Series A Preferred
Stock (assuming all such stock is Put Preferred Stock and required to be
repurchased or redeemed in cash pursuant to this Section 7). No cash
distributions or payments shall be made to or on the account of any Junior
Securities until the full amounts to which the holders of Put Preferred Stock
are entitled pursuant to this Section 7 are distributed and paid to the
holders of Put Preferred Stock, and no cash distribution shall be made on any
Parity Securities upon a Change of Control unless (x) the holders of Parity
Securities are contractually entitled to such distribution and (y) the holders
of Put Preferred Stock and such Parity Securities are to share ratably in any
such distribution in proportion to the full respective amounts to which they
are entitled.

 



      
 

 



 

(e) _Mechanics of Repurchase_.

 



 

(i) Unless waived by the holders representing a majority of the then
outstanding shares of Series A Preferred Stock, in the event a Change of
Control Put is exercised, the Company shall deposit or cause the Successor to
deposit, with a paying agent in trust prior to or on the Sale Date, funds
consisting of cash and, if applicable, Freely Marketable Securities of the
Successor, sufficient to pay the Change of Control Purchase Price with respect
to any Put Preferred Stock on the Sale Date. The paying agent must be a bank
or trust company in good standing, organized under the laws of the United
States of America or any jurisdiction thereof. The deposit in trust with the
paying agent shall be irrevocable as of the date of such deposit, except that
the Company shall be entitled to receive from the paying agent (A) the Change
of Control Purchase Price with respect to shares of Series A Preferred Stock
that are no longer to be repurchased or redeemed due to conversion or
otherwise and (B) the interest or other earnings, if any, earned on any such
deposit. Notwithstanding the deposit of such funds and, if applicable, Freely
Marketable Securities, the Company and the Successor shall remain liable for
the payment of the Change of Control Purchase Price to the extent such Change
of Control Purchase Price is not paid.

 



 

(ii) The paying agent on behalf of the Company shall pay the Change of Control
Purchase Price on the Sale Date upon surrender of the shares of Put Preferred
Stock to be repurchased or redeemed, as applicable (properly endorsed or
assigned for transfer, if the Company shall so require and letters of
transmittal and instructions therefor on reasonable terms are included in the
notice sent by the Company); _provided_ , that if such shares are certificated
and such certificates are lost, wrongfully taken or destroyed, in the absence
of notice to the Company or the transfer agent (if other than the Company)
that such Put Preferred Stock certificates have been acquired by a "protected
purchaser" within the meaning of Section 8-405 of the Uniform Commercial Code,
such certificates need not be so surrendered but the Company may require such
holder to indemnify the Company in a reasonable amount and in a reasonable
manner, post a customary bond in respect of such indemnity, and satisfy such
other reasonable requirements as may be imposed by the Company as permitted by
Section 8-405 of the Uniform Commercial Code, prior to paying such Change of
Control Purchase Price.

 



 

(iii) In case fewer than all the shares represented by any such certificate
shall be repurchased or redeemed, as applicable, a new certificate shall be
issued representing the unrepurchased or unredeemed shares, as applicable,
without cost to the holder thereof. The Company shall pay any documentary,
stamp or similar issue or transfer tax due upon the issuance of a new
certificate for any shares of Series A Preferred Stock not repurchased or
redeemed, as applicable.

 



 

(iv) From and after the Sale Date, shares of the Put Preferred Stock on such
Sale Date shall no longer be deemed to be outstanding; and all powers,
designations, preferences and other rights of the holder thereof as a holder
of Put Preferred Stock (except the right to receive the Change of Control
Purchase Price) shall cease and terminate with respect to such shares;
_provided_ , that, without limiting Section 7(e)(v), in the event that a share
of Put Preferred Stock is not repurchased or redeemed, as applicable, due to a
default in payment by the Company or because the Company is otherwise unable
to legally pay the Change of Control Purchase Price in full, such share

 



      
 

 



 

of Put Preferred Stock shall remain outstanding and shall be entitled to all
of the powers, designations, preferences and other rights (including but not
limited to the payment of dividends and conversion rights) provided for herein
(any such shares, the " _Change of Control Payment Default Shares_ ").

 



 

(v) The Company may not enter into, and shall cause its Affiliates not to
enter into, any agreement providing for a Change of Control unless (x) such
agreement provides for and does not interfere with or prevent (as applicable)
the exercise of the Change of Control Put in a manner that is consistent with
and gives effect to this Section 7 or the COC Conversion rights set forth in
the last sentence of Section 5(a), and (y) the Successor agrees to cause the
Company to make any required repurchases contemplated by this Section 7 and
agrees, for the benefit of the holders of record of the Put Preferred Stock
(including making them beneficiaries of such agreement), that to the extent
the Company is not legally able to repurchase any shares of Put Preferred
Stock, the Successor shall purchase such shares of Put Preferred Stock, as
applicable, and that at the Sale Date the Successor shall have sufficient
funds to consummate such Change of Control (and make all payments required to
be made, including with respect to satisfying any indebtedness obligations)
and to pay the Change of Control Purchase Price for all outstanding shares of
Series A Preferred Stock that are outstanding as of the applicable Sale Date;
_provided_ , that this Section 7(e)(v) shall not limit any rights of the
holders of Series A Preferred Stock pursuant to Section 4(b).

 



 

(vi) Any redemption or repurchase, as applicable, of the Series A Preferred
Stock pursuant to this Section 7 shall be payable out of any cash legally
available therefor or, if applicable, other Liquid Consideration payable in
such Change of Control. If there is not a sufficient amount of cash for the
Company or the Successor to pay the portion of the Change of Control Purchase
Price to be paid in cash pursuant to this Section 7, then such portion of the
Change of Control Purchase Price shall, at the option of holders of a majority
of the outstanding shares of Put Preferred Stock, be paid out of the remaining
assets of the Successor legally available therefor (valued at the Fair Market
Value on the date of payment). The Company and the Successor shall take all
actions required or permitted under applicable law to permit the repurchase or
redemption, as applicable, of the Put Preferred Stock, including, without
limitation, through the revaluation of its assets in accordance with the law
of the state in which it is incorporated or organized, to make funds legally
available for such repurchase or redemption, as applicable.

 



 

(f) All shares of Series A Preferred Stock that are outstanding as of the Sale
Date that (i) do not constitute Put Preferred Stock or (ii) constitute Change
of Control Payment Default Shares shall remain outstanding on the Sale Date
and shall be entitled to all of the powers, designations, preferences and
other rights (including but not limited to the payment of dividends and
conversion rights) provided for herein; _provided_ , _however_ , that if such
Change of Control constitutes a Fundamental Corporate Transaction, the
provisions of Section 5(d)(iii) shall be given effect with respect to such
shares of Series A Preferred Stock that remain outstanding on the Sale Date.

 



 

(g) Prior to the Reorganization, without the prior approval of holders
representing at least a majority of the then-outstanding shares of Series A
Preferred Stock, the Company shall

 



      
 

 



 

not (i) effect, or enter into any transaction that constitutes or would result
in, a Change of Control, (ii) solicit, initiate or knowingly encourage,
facilitate or induce any inquiries regarding, or the making of any proposal or
offer relating to, or that would reasonably be expected to lead to, a Change
of Control or (iii) conduct or engage in any discussions or negotiations
regarding, or furnish to any third party any non-public information relating
to the Company with the effect of or for the purpose of facilitating, inducing
or encouraging any proposal or offer relating to, or that would reasonably be
expected to lead to, a Change of Control.

or administrator of any such plan), unless the Beneficial Owners of Voting

sentence) is the Beneficial Owner, directly or indirectly, of Voting Stock
representing 50% or more of the voting power of the Voting Stock of such
holding company. For purposes of this definition, (1) no Change of Control

2.7.1 Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, it shall be
a condition precedent to the right of the Investors to effect the registration
of any Registrable Securities, or to the obligation of the Company to take any
other action pursuant to this Section 2, that each Investor shall: (i) furnish

Securities held by it as shall be reasonably necessary to effect the
registration of such Investors Registrable Securities, including the
information required in the Selling Stockholder Questionnaire attached hereto

2.9 _Indemnification_. In the event any Registrable Securities are included in
a Registration Statement under this Agreement:

 



 

2.9.1 The Company shall indemnify and hold harmless the Investors, any
Underwriter, and each Person, if any, who controls the Investors or
Underwriter within the meaning of Section 15 of the Securities Act or Section
20 of the Exchange Act and the officers, directors, owners, agents and
employees of such controlling Persons, against any and all losses, claims,
damages or liabilities (joint or several) to which they may become subject
under any securities Laws including the Securities Act, the Exchange Act, or
any other statute or common law of the United States or any other country or
political subdivision thereof, or otherwise, including the amount paid in
settlement of any litigation commenced or threatened (including any amounts
paid pursuant to or in settlement of claims made under the indemnification or
contribution provisions of any underwriting or similar agreement entered into
by the

 



      
 

 



 

Investors in connection with any offering or sale of securities covered by
this Agreement), and shall promptly reimburse them, as and when incurred, for
any legal or other expenses incurred by them in connection with investigating
any claims and defending any actions, insofar as any such losses, claims,
damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) arise out of or are
based upon any of the following statements, omissions or violations (each, a "
** _Violation_** "): (a) any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a
material fact contained in or incorporated by reference into such Registration
Statement, including any preliminary Prospectus or final Prospectus contained
therein or any free writing Prospectus or any amendments or supplements
thereto, or in any offering memorandum or other offering document relating to
the offering and sale of such securities or (b) the omission or alleged
omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein, or
necessary to make the statements therein not misleading; _provided_ ,
_however_ , the Company shall not be liable in any such case for any such
loss, claim, damage, liability or action to the extent that (i) it arises out
of or is based upon a Violation which occurs solely in reliance upon and in
conformity with written information relating to the Investors furnished
expressly for use in connection with such registration by the Investors; or
(ii) is caused by any Investors disposition of Registrable Shares during any
period during which such Investor had actual knowledge that it was obligated
to discontinue any disposition of Registrable Shares pursuant to Section 2.2.4
and has actually received prior written notice from the Company of such
obligation.

 



 

2.9.2 The Investors shall indemnify and hold harmless the Company, each of its
directors, each of its officers who has signed the registration statement,
each Person, if any, who controls the Company within the meaning of Section 15
of the Securities Act or Section 20 of the Exchange Act and the officers,
directors, owners, agents and employees of such controlling Persons, any
Underwriter, any other Person selling securities in such registration
statement and any controlling Person of any such Underwriter or other Person,
against any losses, claims, damages or liabilities (joint or several) to which
any of the foregoing Persons may become subject, under liabilities (or actions
in respect thereto) which arise out of or are based upon any Violation, in
each case to the extent (and only to the extent) that such Violation: (a)
arises out of or is based upon a Violation which occurs solely in reliance
upon and in conformity with written information relating to the Investors
furnished expressly for use in connection with such registration by the
Investors; or (b) is caused by any Investors disposition of Registrable
Shares during any period during which such Investor had actual knowledge that
it was obligated to discontinue any disposition of Registrable Shares pursuant
to Section 2.2.4 and has actually received prior written notice from the
Company of such obligation. The Investors shall reimburse, as and when
incurred, any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by any Person
intended to be indemnified pursuant to this Section 2.9.2, in connection with
investigating or defending any such loss, claim, damage, liability or action;
_provided_ , _however_ , that the indemnity agreement contained in this
Section 2.9.2 shall not apply to amounts paid in settlement of any such loss,
claim, damage, liability or action if such settlement is effected without
consent of the Investors, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld;
_provided_ , _further_ , that the total amount to be indemnified shall be
limited to the net proceeds (after deducting the underwriting discounts and
commissions) received by the Investors in the offering to which the
registration statement or Prospectus relates.

 



 

2.9.3 Promptly after receipt by an indemnified party under this Section 2.9 of
notice of the commencement of any action (including any action by a
Governmental Authority), such indemnified party shall, if a claim in respect
thereof is to be made against any indemnifying party under this Section 2.9,
deliver to the indemnifying party a written notice of the commencement thereof
and the indemnifying party shall have the right to participate in, and, to the
extent the indemnifying party so desires, jointly with any other indemnifying
party similarly noticed, to assume the defense thereof with counsel mutually
satisfactory to the parties; _provided_ , _however_ , that an indemnified
party shall have the right to retain its own counsel, with the reasonable fees
and expenses to be paid by the indemnifying party, if representation of such
indemnified party by the counsel retained by the indemnifying party would be
inappropriate due to actual or potential differing interests between such
indemnified party and any other

 



      
 

 



 

party represented by such counsel in such proceeding. The failure to deliver
written notice to the indemnifying party within a reasonable time of the
commencement of any such action shall not relieve such indemnifying party of
any liability to the indemnified party under this Section 2.9 except to the
extent that the indemnifying party would be prejudiced as a result of such
failure, but the omission so to deliver written notice to the indemnifying
party shall not relieve it of any liability that it may have to any
indemnified party otherwise than under this Section 2.9.

 



 

2.9.4 In order to provide for just and equitable contribution to joint
liability in any case in which a claim for indemnification is made pursuant to
this Section 2.9 but it is judicially determined (by the entry of a final
judgment or decree by a court of competent jurisdiction and the expiration of
time to appeal or the denial of the last right of appeal) that such
indemnification may not be enforced in such case notwithstanding the fact that
this Section 2.9 provided for indemnification in such case, the Company and
the Investors shall contribute to the aggregate losses, claims, damages or
liabilities to which they may be subject (after contribution from others) in
proportion to the relative fault of the Company, on the one hand, and the
Investors, on the other hand in connection with the statements or omissions
which result in such losses, claims, damages liabilities, or expenses as well
as any other relevant equitable considerations. The relative fault of the
indemnifying party on the one hand and of the indemnified party on the other
shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether the untrue or
alleged untrue statement of a material fact or the omission or alleged
omission to state a material fact relates to information supplied by the
indemnifying party or by the indemnified party, and by such Persons relative
intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent
such statement or omission; _provided_ , _however_ , that in any such case, no
Person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section
11(f) of the Securities Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any Person
who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation; _provided further_ ,
_however_ , that in no event shall any contribution under this Section 2.9.4
on the part of the Investors exceed the net proceeds (after deducting the
underwriting discounts and commissions) received by the Investors from the
sale of Registrable Securities giving rise to such contribution obligation.

 



 

2.9.5 The obligations of the Company and the Investors under this Section 2.9
shall survive the completion of any offering of Registrable Securities in a
registration statement under this Agreement and otherwise.

 



 

2.10 _Commission Reports._ With a view to making available to the Investors
the benefits of Rule 144 under the Securities Act and any other rule or
regulation of the Commission that may at any time permit the Investors to sell
Registrable Securities of the Company to the public without registration, the
Company agrees to at any time that it is a reporting company under Section 13
or 15(d) of the Exchange Act:

 



 

2.11.1 file with the Commission in a timely manner all reports and other
documents required of the Company under the Exchange Act; and

 



 

2.11.2 furnish to each Investor, so long as such Investor owns any Registrable
Securities, forthwith upon request (i) a written statement by the Company that
it has complied with the reporting requirements of the Exchange Act, (ii) a
copy of the most recent annual or quarterly report of the Company and such
other reports and documents so filed by the Company, and (iii) such other
information as may be reasonably requested in availing any Holder of any rule
or regulation of the Commission which permits the selling of any Registrable
Securities without registration.

 



 

2.12 _Termination of Registration Rights_. Except for Section 2.9, which shall
survive until the expiration of any applicable statutes of limitation, Section
2 shall terminate automatically and have no further force or effect upon the
expiration of the Registration Rights Term.

 



      
 

 



 

3. RESTRICTIONS ON BENEFICIAL OWNERSHIP.

acquisition of Capital Stock or other Equity Interests of the Company will be
treated as an "ownership change" as defined in Section 382 of the Code), any
Capital Stock or other Equity Interests of the Company acquired by the
Investor or its controlled Affiliates so long as the total beneficial
ownership of the Investor and its controlled Affiliates in the Companys

Preferred Shares) at such time and (d) any securities received from the
Company by way of dividend or distribution;

Combination** "); _provided_ , _however_ , that from and after the filing of a
Schedule 14D-9 (or successor form of Tender Offer Solicitation/Recommendation
Statement under Rule 14d-9 of the Exchange Act) by the Company wherein a
majority of the Board recommend that stockholders accept any such Business
Combination, the Investors and their Affiliates shall not be prohibited from

rights under this Agreement, the Certificate of Designation, the Securities
Purchase Agreements or any document entered into in connection with any of the
foregoing;

 



 

3.1.8 enter into discussions, negotiations, arrangements or agreements with

pledge of securities (subject to Section 2.1), (2) the rights available
(including the enforcement of such rights) to the Investors and their

reasonably be expected to, require any public disclosure of such
communications.

 



 

4. MISCELLANEOUS.

 



 

4.1 _Other Registration Rights and Arrangements_. The Company represents and
warrants that no person, other than the holders of the Registrable Securities
and any holder of rights under the registration rights agreements publicly
disclosed by the Company prior to the date of the Securities Purchase
Agreements, has any right to require the Company to register any of the
Companys share capital for sale or to include the Companys share capital in
any registration filed by the Company for the sale of shares for its own
account or for the account of any other person. The Company shall not
hereafter ( _i_ ) grant any registration rights to third parties which are
more favorable than or inconsistent with the rights granted to the Investors
hereunder or ( _ii_ ) enter into any agreement, take any action or permit any
change to occur, with respect to securities which is inconsistent with,
violates or subordinates the rights expressly granted to the Investors
hereunder; and, in the event of any conflict between any such agreement or
agreements and this Agreement, the terms of this Agreement shall prevail.

 



 

4.2 _Assignment; No Third Party Beneficiaries_. This Agreement and the rights,
duties and obligations of the Company hereunder may not be assigned or
delegated by any Investor without the prior written consent of the Company or
by the Company without the prior written consent of each Investor, in each
case, in whole or in part. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the rights of an
Investor hereunder may be assigned in connection with a transfer of
Registrable Securities to any Affiliate of that Investor if the

 



      
 

 



 

transferee to which assignment is being made has delivered to the Company the
executed Joinder Agreement in the form attached as _Exhibit B_ hereto
agreeing to be bound by, and be party to, this Agreement. This Agreement and
the provisions hereof shall be binding upon and shall inure to the benefit of
each of the parties hereto and their respective successors and assigns and the
holders of Registrable Securities and their respective successors and
permitted assigns. This Agreement is not intended to confer any rights or
benefits on any persons that are not party hereto other than as expressly set
forth in _Section 2.9_ and this _Section 4.2_.

 



 

4.3 _Notices_. All notices, demands, requests, consents, approvals or other
communications (collectively, " ** _Notices_** ") required or permitted to be

hereto hereby irrevocably waives personal service of process and consents to
process being served in any such proceeding by mailing a copy thereof via
registered or certified mail or overnight delivery (with evidence of delivery)
to such party at the address in effect for notices to it under this Agreement

performance or other equitable relief to enforce specifically the terms and
provisions hereof in the courts described in Section 4.5 without proof of

acknowledge and agree that any party seeking an injunction or injunctions to
prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and
provisions of this Agreement in accordance with this Section 4.6 shall not be
required to provide any bond or other security in connection with any such

only, do not constitute a part of this Agreement and shall not be deemed to
limit or affect any of the provisions hereof. The language used in this
Agreement will be deemed to be the language chosen by the parties to express
their mutual intent, and no rules of strict construction will be applied
against any party. This Agreement shall be construed as if drafted jointly by
the parties, and no presumption or burden of proof shall arise favoring or
disfavoring any party by virtue of the authorship of any provisions of this
Agreement. Unless otherwise indicated to the contrary herein by the context or
use thereof: (i) the words, "herein," "hereto," "hereof" and words of similar
import refer to this Agreement as a whole, including the Schedules and

word "extent" in the phrase "to the extent" shall mean the degree to which a
subject or other thing extends, and such phrase shall not mean simply "if";

required to be done or taken on a day that is not a Business Day or on which a

the first succeeding Business Day thereafter.

(including all agreements entered into pursuant hereto and thereto and all
certificates and instruments delivered pursuant hereto or thereto) constitute
the entire agreement of the parties with respect to the subject matter hereof
and supersedes all prior and contemporaneous agreements, representations,
understandings, negotiations and discussions between the parties, whether oral

ACCREDITED INVESTOR QUESTIONNAIRE

 



 

(ALL INFORMATION WILL BE TREATED CONFIDENTIALLY)

 



 

To: GTT Communications, Inc.

 



 

This Investor Questionnaire (" _Questionnaire_ ") must be completed by each
potential investor in connection with the offer and sale of securities
(collectively, the " _Securities_ "), of GTT Communications, Inc., a Delaware
corporation (the " _Corporation_ "). The Securities are being offered and sold
by the Corporation without registration under the Securities Act of 1933, as
amended (the " _Securities Act_ "), and the securities laws of certain states,
in reliance on the exemptions contained in Section 4(2) of the Securities Act
and on Regulation D promulgated thereunder and in reliance on similar
exemptions under applicable state laws. The Corporation must determine that a
potential investor meets certain suitability requirements before offering or
selling Securities to such investor. The purpose of this Questionnaire is to
assure the Corporation that each investor will meet the applicable suitability
requirements. The information supplied by you will be used in determining
whether you meet such criteria, and reliance upon the private offering
exemptions from registration is based in part on the information herein
supplied.

 



 

This Questionnaire does not constitute an offer to sell or a solicitation of
an offer to buy any security. Your answers will be kept strictly confidential.
However, by signing this Questionnaire, you will be authorizing the
Corporation to provide a completed copy of this Questionnaire to such parties
as the Corporation deems appropriate in order to ensure that the offer and
sale of the Securities will not result in a violation of the Securities Act or
the securities laws of any state and that you otherwise satisfy the
suitability standards applicable to purchasers of the Securities. All
potential investors must answer all applicable questions and complete, date
and sign this Questionnaire. Please print or type your responses and attach
additional sheets of paper if necessary to complete your answers to any item.
