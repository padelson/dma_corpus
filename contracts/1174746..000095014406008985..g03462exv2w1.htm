</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;WHEREAS, in accordance with and subject to the New York Not-For-Profit Corporation Law (the
&#147;<U>N-PCL</U>&#148;) and the bylaws of NYBOT, all record owners of regular memberships in NYBOT other
than NYBOT and its Subsidiaries (the &#147;<U>Members</U>&#148;) own (i)&nbsp;Equity Memberships (as defined
under the bylaws and rules of NYBOT) (the &#147;<U>Membership Interests</U>&#148;) and (ii)&nbsp;Trading Rights
(as hereinafter defined) associated with such Membership Interests;
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;WHEREAS, ICE desires to acquire all of the Membership Interests on the terms and subject to
the conditions set forth in this Agreement and to leave certain Trading Rights outstanding and
exercisable from and after the Effective Time through the Surviving Corporation (as hereinafter
defined) on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in the Bylaws and the Rules (as
hereinafter defined);
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;WHEREAS, the Boards of Directors of ICE, Merger Sub and NYBOT have each determined that it is
advisable and in the best interests of their respective members (in the case of NYBOT) and
stockholders (in the case of ICE and Merger Sub) to consummate, and have approved, the business
combination transaction provided for herein in which NYBOT would merge with and into Merger Sub and
Merger Sub would continue to be a wholly owned subsidiary of ICE (the &#147;<U>Merger</U>&#148;);
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;WHEREAS, it is intended that, for United States federal income tax purposes, the Merger shall
qualify as a &#147;reorganization&#148; under the provisions of Section 368(a) of the Internal Revenue Code
of 1986, as amended (the &#147;<U>Code</U>&#148;); and
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;WHEREAS, each of ICE and NYBOT desires to make certain representations, warranties, covenants
and agreements in connection with this Agreement.

obtained by NYBOT or any of its Subsidiaries from, any Governmental Entity (as hereinafter defined)
or Self-Regulatory Organization in connection with the execution and delivery by NYBOT of this
Agreement, the performance by NYBOT of its obligations hereunder, and the consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(f) <U>NYBOT Reports; Financial Statements</U>. NYBOT has made available to ICE its annual
reports and proxy statements delivered to its Members since December&nbsp;31, 2004 (collectively, the
&#147;<U>NYBOT Reports</U>&#148;). Neither NYBOT nor any of its Subsidiaries files with any Governmental
Entity or Self-Regulatory Organization any NYBOT Report. As of their respective dates (or if
amended, as of the date of such amendment), the NYBOT Reports did not contain any untrue statement
of a material fact or omit to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to
make the statements made therein, in light of the circumstances in which they were made, not
misleading. NYBOT has delivered to ICE true and complete copies of the audited consolidated
financial statements of NYBOT for the fiscal year ended December&nbsp;31, 2005 (the &#147;<U>NYBOT Audited
Financial Statements</U>&#148;) and the unaudited consolidated financial statements of NYBOT for the six
months ended June&nbsp;30, 2006 (the &#147;<U>NYBOT Interim Financial Statements</U>&#148; and, together with the
NYBOT Audited Financial Statements, the &#147;<U>NYBOT Financial Statements</U>&#148;). NYBOT has delivered
to ICE a true and complete copy of the unaudited management report of NYBOT for the month ended
July&nbsp;31, 2006 (the &#147;<U>Management Report</U>&#148;). Each of the consolidated balance sheets included
in the NYBOT Financial Statements and the Management Report (including the related notes and
schedules) fairly presents the consolidated financial position of NYBOT and its Subsidiaries as of
its date and each of the consolidated statements of revenues, expenses, changes in members&#146; equity
and cash flows included in the NYBOT Financial Statements and the Management Report (including any
related notes and schedules) fairly presents the results of operations, members&#146; equity and cash
flows, as the case may be, of NYBOT and its Subsidiaries for the periods set forth therein, in each
case in conformity with GAAP consistently applied during the periods involved, except as may be
noted therein. Except for liabilities and obligations incurred in the ordinary course of business
since December&nbsp;31, 2005, neither NYBOT nor any of its Subsidiaries has any liabilities or
obligations of any nature required by GAAP to be set forth on a consolidated balance sheet of NYBOT
or any of its Subsidiaries or in the notes thereto which, individually or in the aggregate, could
reasonably be expected to have a NYBOT Material Adverse Effect. The NYBOT Financial Statements and
the Management Report have been compiled from, and were prepared in accordance with, the books and
records of NYBOT and its Affiliates. The books and records of NYBOT and its Affiliates are true,
complete and correct in all material respects and have been maintained in accordance with sound
business practices. NYBOT has designed and maintained a system of internal accounting controls
sufficient to provide reasonable assurances regarding the reliability of financial

have conducted their respective businesses only in, and have not engaged in any material
transaction other than according to, the ordinary and usual course of such businesses and there has
not been (i)&nbsp;any change or development that, individually or in the aggregate, has had or is
reasonably expected to have, a NYBOT Material Adverse Effect; (ii)&nbsp;any material damage, destruction
or other casualty loss with respect to any material asset or property owned, leased or otherwise
used by NYBOT or any of its Subsidiaries, whether or not covered by insurance; or (iii)&nbsp;any change
by NYBOT in financial accounting principles, practices or methods that is not required by GAAP.
Since December&nbsp;31, 2005, except as provided for herein, there has not been any increase in the
compensation payable or that could become payable by NYBOT or any of its Subsidiaries to officers
or key employees or any amendment of or other modification to any of the NYBOT Benefit Plans other
than increases or amendments in the ordinary and usual course consistent with past practice.

conducted in compliance in all material respects with all Laws and the applicable rules of any
Self-Regulatory Organization. Neither NYBOT nor any
of its Subsidiaries is in conflict with, or in default or violation of, any Contract to which
NYBOT or any of its Subsidiaries is a party or by which NYBOT or any of its Subsidiaries or its or
any of their respective properties is bound or affected, except for any such conflicts, defaults or
violations that, individually or in the aggregate, have not had and are not reasonably expected to
have a NYBOT Material Adverse Effect. No investigation, review, audit or similar procedure by any
Governmental Entity or any Self-Regulatory Organization with respect to NYBOT or any of its
Subsidiaries is pending or, to the knowledge of NYBOT, threatened, nor has any Governmental Entity
or any Self-Regulatory Organization indicated an intention to conduct the same, except, in each
case, for those the outcome of which, individually or in the aggregate, have not had and are not
reasonably expected to have a NYBOT Material Adverse Effect. Except as, individually or in the
aggregate, is not reasonably expected to have a NYBOT Material Adverse Effect, (x)&nbsp;no material
change is required in NYBOT&#146;s or any of its Subsidiaries&#146; processes, properties or procedures to
comply with any Laws in effect on the date hereof or enacted as of the date hereof and scheduled to
be effective after the date hereof, and (y)&nbsp;NYBOT has not received any written notice or written
communication of any noncompliance with any Laws and no Governmental Entity has otherwise
identified any instance in which NYBOT or any of its Subsidiaries is or may be in violation of
applicable Laws. Each of NYBOT and its Subsidiaries has all permits, licenses, franchises,
variances, exemptions, orders and other authorizations, consents and approvals (together,
&#147;<U>Permits</U>&#148;) of all Governmental Entities and Self-Regulatory Organizations necessary to
conduct its business as presently conducted, except where the failure to have such Permits,
individually or in the aggregate, has not had and is not reasonably expected to have a NYBOT
Material Adverse Effect.

all Tax law changes prior to the Economic Growth and Tax Relief Reconciliation Act of 2001 or has

result in the loss of the qualification of any such NYBOT Pension Plan under Section 401(a) of the
Code, or (B)&nbsp;is entitled to rely upon an opinion letter issued to the sponsor of a prototype plan.
Neither NYBOT nor any of its Subsidiaries has engaged in a transaction with respect to any NYBOT

single-employer plan of a NYBOT ERISA Affiliate has an &#147;accumulated funding deficiency&#148; (whether or
not waived) within the meaning of Section&nbsp;412 of the Code or Section&nbsp;302 of ERISA and no NYBOT
ERISA Affiliate has an outstanding funding waiver. Neither any NYBOT Pension Plan nor any
single-employer plan of a NYBOT ERISA Affiliate has been required to file information pursuant to
