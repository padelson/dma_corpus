 _AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER_  

   

 This AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER (this " _Agreement_ "), dated as of September 14, 2006, is by and among IntercontinentalExchange, Inc., a Delaware corporation (" _ICE_ "), CFC Acquisition Co., a Delaware corporation (" _Merger Sub_ ") and Board of Trade of the City of New York, Inc., a New York not-for-profit corporation (" _NYBOT_ "). 

  

RECITALS 

   

 WHEREAS, in accordance with and subject to the New York Not-For-Profit Corporation Law (the " _N-PCL_ ") and the bylaws of NYBOT, all record owners of regular memberships in NYBOT other than NYBOT and its Subsidiaries (the " _Members_ ") own (i) Equity Memberships (as defined under the bylaws and rules of NYBOT) (the " _Membership Interests_ ") and (ii) Trading Rights (as hereinafter defined) associated with such Membership Interests; 

  

 WHEREAS, ICE desires to acquire all of the Membership Interests on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement and to leave certain Trading Rights outstanding and exercisable from and after the Effective Time through the Surviving Corporation (as hereinafter defined) on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in the Bylaws and the Rules (as hereinafter defined); 

  

 WHEREAS, the Boards of Directors of ICE, Merger Sub and NYBOT have each determined that it is advisable and in the best interests of their respective members (in the case of NYBOT) and stockholders (in the case of ICE and Merger Sub) to consummate, and have approved, the business combination transaction provided for herein in which NYBOT would merge with and into Merger Sub and Merger Sub would continue to be a wholly owned subsidiary of ICE (the " _Merger_ "); 

  

 WHEREAS, it is intended that, for United States federal income tax purposes, the Merger shall qualify as a "reorganization" under the provisions of Section 368(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the " _Code_ "); and 

  

 WHEREAS, each of ICE and NYBOT desires to make certain representations, warranties, covenants and agreements in connection with this Agreement. 

  

 NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the premises, and of the representations, warranties, covenants and agreements contained herein, the parties hereto agree as follows: 

  

ARTICLE I 

   

 _Formation of Surviving Corporation_   

  

 1.1. _Organization of the Surviving Corporation_. The certificate of incorporation (the " _Charter_ ") of Merger Sub (the " _Surviving Corporation_ ") and the bylaws of the Surviving Corporation (the " _Bylaws_ ") shall be substantially in the forms   ##### 

  

  

  

attached hereto as Exhibit A and Exhibit B, respectively. Promptly after the
date hereof, and in any event prior to the mailing of the Proxy
Statement/Prospectus to the Members, ICE and NYBOT shall cooperate to prepare
a draft of the rules of the Surviving Corporation (the " _Rules_ ");
_provided_ ,  _however_ , that such draft Rules shall be identical to the
rules of NYBOT as in effect as of the date of this Agreement with only such
changes as are reasonably necessary to conform such Rules to the Bylaws and
this Agreement and such other changes as the parties mutually
agree. Notwithstanding the foregoing, ICE may (but shall not be required to)
modify or amend the Charter, Bylaws and/or the Rules, subject to the
restrictions contained in Article XVI of the Bylaws, in response to
requirements imposed by, or comments received from, the Commodities Futures
Trading Commission (" _CFTC_ ") or its staff or any other governmental
authority with lawful jurisdiction without the consent of NYBOT after giving
NYBOT notice of such proposed modification or amendment, unless, within five
business days of receiving such notice, NYBOT notifies ICE that it has
determined in good faith that the modifications or amendments are reasonably
likely to have a material adverse effect on the Surviving Corporation. 

   

 1.2. _Directors of the Surviving Corporation_. 

   

 (a) From and after the Effective Time, each of the members of the Board of Directors of the Surviving Corporation shall be appointed by ICE, subject to compliance by ICE with all applicable legal, regulatory and listing requirements relating to the composition of the Surviving Corporations Board of Directors and subject to Section 1.2(b). Each such director shall remain in office until his or her successors are duly elected or appointed, as the case may be, and qualified in accordance with the Charter, the Bylaws and applicable Law or until his or her earlier death, resignation or removal in accordance with the Charter and the Bylaws. 

   

 (b) As of the Effective Time, ICE shall elect, as members of the Board of Directors of the Surviving Corporation, the individuals identified in Annex 1.2(b)(x). ICE shall take all requisite action to ensure that two of the individuals (determined in ICEs discretion) identified in Annex 1.2(b)(y) (the " _NYBOT Designees_ ") shall serve as members of the Board of Directors of the Surviving Corporation for one two-year term from and after the Effective Time. 

   

 (c) As of the Effective Time, ICE shall take all requisite action to ensure that four of the individuals (determined in ICEs discretion) identified in Annex 1.2(b)(y) (the " _Public Directors_ ") shall serve as members of the Board of Directors of the Surviving Corporation for four one-year terms from and after the Effective Time. 

   

 1.3. _Officers of the Surviving Corporation_. At the Effective Time, ICE shall cause the officers and directors of NYBOT immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than the Chief Executive Officer of NYBOT) to be the executive officers of the Surviving Corporation. The Chief Executive Officer of Merger Sub prior to the Effective Time shall become the Chief Executive Officer of the Surviving Corporation. Each officer of the Surviving Corporation shall remain in office until his or her successor is   ##### 

  

  

  

duly appointed in accordance with the Bylaws and applicable Law or until his
or her earlier death, resignation or removal in accordance with the Charter
and the Bylaws. 

   

ARTICLE II

 2.3. _Effective Time_. 

   

 (a) As soon as practicable following the satisfaction or waiver (subject to applicable Law) of the conditions set forth in Article VII, on the Closing Date, the parties shall file or deliver, as appropriate, the Certificates of Merger with or to the Secretary of State of Delaware and with the Department of State of New York in such form as is required by and executed and acknowledged in accordance with the relevant provisions of the N-PCL and DGCL, as appropriate, and make all other filings or recordings required under the N-PCL and DGCL, as appropriate. 

   

 (b) The Merger shall become effective at (i) the date and time on which a certificate of merger relating to the Merger (the " _Delaware Certificate of Merger_ ") is duly filed with the Secretary of State of Delaware as required to effect such merger and a certificate of merger relating to the Merger (the " _New York Certificate of Merger_ " and, together with the Delaware Certificate of Merger, the " _Certificates of Merger_ ") is duly filed by the Department of State of New York as required to effect such merger, or (ii) such subsequent time as ICE and NYBOT shall agree and as shall be specified in the Certificates of Merger (such time that the Merger shall become effective being the " _Effective Time_ ").

 3.3. _Rules_. The parties hereto shall take all actions necessary so that the draft Rules as mutually agreed pursuant to Section 1.1 shall be the Rules until thereafter amended as provided in the Bylaws or by applicable Law.

 _Effect of the Merger on Membership Interests and Capital Stock_   

  

 4.1. _Effect on Membership Interests_. As a result of the Merger and without any action on the part of the holder of any Membership Interest: 

   

 (a) At the Effective Time, each Membership Interest issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall automatically be converted into and constitute the right to receive, at the election of the Member that is the holder of such Membership Interest as provided in and subject to the provisions of Section 4.3, _either_ : 

   

 (i) (A) 17,025 shares of newly issued, fully paid and nonassessable shares of common stock, par value $.01 per share, of ICE (" _ICE Common Stock_ "), _plus_ (B) at the time and in the manner set forth in Section 4.7, the right to receive the Per Interest Excess Consideration (as hereinafter defined), if any, _plus_ (C) the Per Interest Additional Stock Consideration (as hereinafter defined), if any (collectively, the " _Stock Consideration_ "); _or_  

   

 (ii) (A) the right to receive an amount of cash equal to $1,074,719 _plus_ (B) at the time and in the manner set forth in Section 4.7, the right to receive the Per Interest Excess Consideration (as hereinafter defined), if any, _plus_ (C) the Per Interest Additional Cash Consideration (as hereinafter defined), if any (collectively, the " _Cash Consideration_ " and, together with the Stock Consideration, the " _Merger Consideration_ "). 

   

 (b) From and after the Effective Time, no Membership Interests shall remain outstanding, in treasury or authorized but unissued, and all Membership Interests shall be cancelled and retired and shall cease to exist. Each entry in the Member records of NYBOT formerly representing an issued and outstanding Membership Interest (a " _Book Entry Interest_ ") shall thereafter represent only (i) the right to receive the Merger   ##### 

  

  

  

Consideration, (ii) the right, if any, to receive pursuant to Section 4.4(e)
cash in lieu of fractional shares and (iii) the right to receive any
distribution or dividend pursuant to Section 4.4(c), if any. 

   

 (c) Each right to execute trades in Commodity Contracts (as defined in NYBOTs rules as of the date of this Agreement) on the Exchange (as defined in NYBOTs rules as of the date of this Agreement), whether granted as a Trading Permit (as defined in NYBOTs rules as of the date of this Agreement), belonging to a Membership Interest, a Lessee Member (as hereinafter defined), or as otherwise shall have been in existence (a " _Trading Right_ ") shall be and become, automatically at the Effective Time, solely the right and privilege to trade futures, futures option contracts and similar instruments on the Exchange (as defined in the Rules) to the extent expressly provided for in, and subject to, the Bylaws and the Rules. 

   

 4.2. _Effect on Surviving Corporation Common Stock_. At the Effective Time, each share of Surviving Corporation common stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (the " _Surviving Corporation Common Stock_ ") shall remain outstanding and each certificate therefor shall continue to evidence one share of Surviving Corporation Common Stock. 

   

 4.3. _Election Procedures_. 

   

 (a) An election form and other appropriate and customary transmittal materials in such form as ICE and NYBOT shall mutually agree (the " _Election Form_ ") shall be mailed on the same date as the Proxy Statement/Prospectus is mailed to the Members or on such other date as ICE and NYBOT shall mutually agree (the " _Mailing Date_ ") to each Member as of the close of business on the fifth business day prior to the Mailing Date (the " _Election Form Record Date_"). Prior to the Mailing Date, ICE shall appoint, with the reasonable consent of NYBOT, a commercial bank or trust company, or a Subsidiary thereof, to act as paying and exchange agent under this Agreement (the " _Exchange Agent_ "). 

   

 (b) Each Election Form shall (A) permit the Member to specify (i) the number of Membership Interests, or the percentage of any one or more Membership Interests, held by such Member with respect to which such Member elects to receive the Stock Consideration (" _Stock Election Shares_ "), (ii) the number of Membership Interests, or the percentage of any one or more Membership Interests, held by such Member with respect to which such Member elects to receive the Cash Consideration (" _Cash Election Shares_ ") and/or (iii) the number of Membership Interests, or the percentage of any one or more Membership Interests, held by such Member with respect to which such Member makes no election referred to in clause (i) or (ii) of this Section 4.3(b) (" _No Election Shares_ ") and (B) indicate that a Member making an election under clause (A) of this paragraph (b) may do so only with respect to a whole Membership Interest or a percentage of a Membership Interest representing at least 10%, or any whole multiple of 10%, of any Membership Interest) . Any Membership Interests with respect to which the Exchange Agent has not received an effective, properly completed Election Form on or before 5:00 p.m. on the fifth day before the NYBOT Members Meeting (or such other   ##### 

  

  

  

time and date as ICE and NYBOT may mutually agree) (the " _Election Deadline_
") shall also be deemed to be No Election Shares. 

   

 (c) ICE shall make available one or more Election Forms as may reasonably be requested from time to time by any person who becomes a Member between the Election Form Record Date and the close of business on the business day prior to the Election Deadline, and NYBOT shall provide to the Exchange Agent all information reasonably necessary for it to perform as specified herein. 

   

 (d) Any such election shall have been properly made only if the Exchange Agent shall have actually received a properly completed Election Form by the Election Deadline. An Election Form shall be deemed properly completed only if duly executed and delivered in accordance with the instructions thereto. Any Election Form may be revoked or changed by the person submitting such Election Form only by written notice received by the Exchange Agent prior to the Election Deadline. In the event an Election Form is revoked prior to the Election Deadline, unless a subsequent properly completed Election Form is submitted and actually received by the Exchange Agent by the Election Deadline, the Membership Interests represented by such Election Form shall become No Election Shares. Subject to the terms of this Agreement and of the Election Form, the Exchange Agent shall have reasonable discretion to determine whether any election, revocation or change has been properly or timely made and to disregard immaterial defects in the Election Forms, and any good faith decisions of the Exchange Agent regarding such matters shall be binding and conclusive. Neither ICE nor the Exchange Agent shall be under any obligation to notify any person of any defect in an Election Form. 

   

 (e) Within ten business days after the Effective Time, ICE shall cause the Exchange Agent to effect the allocation among the Members of rights to receive ICE Common Stock and/or cash in the Merger in accordance with the Election Forms as follows: 

   

 (i) _Cash Oversubscribed_. If the aggregate Cash Consideration that would otherwise be paid upon the conversion in the Merger of the Cash Election Shares (not taking into account any cash payable pursuant to Section 4.7 in connection with the Closing Cash Amount) _plus_ any cash to be paid in lieu of fractional shares (the " _Cash Outlay_ ") is greater than (A) $400 million  _minus_ (B) the Awarded Cash Consideration (the " _Closing Aggregate Cash Consideration_ "), then: 

   

       | (A)  |   | all Stock Election Shares and No Election Shares
shall be converted into the right to receive the Stock Consideration,  
---|---|---|--- 
      
    | (B)  |   | the Exchange Agent shall then determine, pro rata from
among the Cash Election Shares, a sufficient percentage of Cash Election
Shares to receive the Stock Consideration (" _Stock Designated Shares_ ")
such that the aggregate cash amount that will be paid in the Merger equals as
closely as practicable the Closing Aggregate Cash Consideration, and all
Stock Designated Shares shall be  
    

  ##### 

  

   

       |   |   | converted into the right to receive the Stock
Consideration, and  
---|---|---|--- 
      
    | (C)  |   | the Cash Election Shares that are not Stock Designated
Shares will be converted into the right to receive the Cash Consideration.  
   

  

 (ii) _Cash Undersubscribed_. If the Cash Outlay is less than the Closing Aggregate Cash Consideration, then: 

   

       | (A)  |   | all Cash Election Shares shall be converted into
the right to receive the Cash Consideration,  
---|---|---|--- 
      
    | (B)  |   | the Exchange Agent shall then determine first, pro rata
from among the No Election Shares, and then (if necessary), pro rata from
among the Stock Election Shares, a sufficient percentage of Stock Election
Shares to receive the Cash Consideration (" _Cash Designated Shares_ ") such
that the aggregate cash amount that will be paid in the Merger equals as
closely as practicable the Closing Aggregate Cash Consideration, and all Cash
Designated Shares shall be converted into the right to receive the Cash
Consideration, and  
      
    | (C)  |   | the Stock Election Shares that are not Cash Designated
Shares and the No Election Shares that are not Cash Designated Shares shall
be converted into the right to receive the Stock Consideration.  
   

  

 (iii) _Cash Subscriptions Sufficient_. If the Cash Outlay is equal or nearly equal (as determined by the Exchange Agent) to the Closing Aggregate Cash Consideration, then subparagraphs (A) and (B) above shall not apply and all Cash Election Shares shall be converted into the right to receive the Cash Consideration and all Stock Election Shares and No Election Shares shall be converted into the right to receive the Stock Consideration. 

   

 (f) The pro ration process to be used by the Exchange Agent shall consist of such equitable pro ration processes as determined by ICE in accordance with this Agreement. 

   

 (g) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement to the contrary, a sufficient number of Cash Election Shares may be converted into the right to receive Stock Consideration (including in connection with the Closing Cash Amount), but only to the extent necessary to secure the tax ruling required by Sections 7.2(c) and 7.3(c). 

   

 4.4. _Exchange of Certificates_. 

   

 (a) _Exchange Agent_. On or prior to the Effective Time, ICE shall deposit, or cause to be deposited, with the Exchange Agent, for the benefit of holders of record of Membership Interests as of immediately prior to the Effective Time, (i) an amount of cash sufficient to pay the Closing Aggregate Cash Consideration, and (ii) an   ##### 

  

  

  

amount of cash sufficient to be paid pursuant to Section 4.4(e) in respect of
any cash in lieu of fractional shares of ICE Common Stock, in each case
in exchange for outstanding Membership Interests upon delivery to the
Exchange Agent of instructions regarding the transfer and cancellation of
Book Entry Interests (the " _Instructions_ ") (such cash being hereinafter
referred to as the " _Exchange Fund_ "). 

   

 (b) _Exchange Procedures_. ICE shall cause appropriate transmittal materials, in such form as reasonably agreed upon by ICE and NYBOT, to be provided by the Exchange Agent to holders of record of Membership Interests as soon as practicable after the Effective Time advising such holders of the effectiveness of the Merger and the procedure for providing the Instructions to the Exchange Agent. Upon the delivery to the Exchange Agent of the Instructions, the holder of such Book Entry Interests shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor (i) evidence in book entry form of the issuance of that number of whole shares of ICE Common Stock in respect of the aggregate Stock Consideration that such holder is entitled to receive pursuant to Section 4.1(a) and Section 4.3 (after taking into account all Membership Interests then held by such holder) and (ii) a check in the amount (after giving effect to any required Tax withholdings) equal to the sum of (x) any cash in lieu of fractional shares and (y) any cash in respect of the Cash Consideration (after taking into account all Membership Interests then held by such holder), and the Book Entry Interests which are the subject of such Instructions shall forthwith be cancelled. No interest will be paid or accrued on any amount payable upon such transfer and cancellation of any Book Entry Interests. In the event of a transfer of ownership of Membership Interests that is not registered in the transfer records of NYBOT, evidence in book entry form of the issuance of the proper number of shares of ICE Common Stock, together with a check for any cash to be paid upon the delivery to the Exchange Agent of the Instructions, may be issued and/or paid to such a transferee if written instructions authorizing the transfer of any Book Entry Interests are presented to the Exchange Agent, accompanied by all documents required to evidence and effect such transfer and to evidence that any applicable stock transfer Taxes have been paid. If any shares of ICE Common Stock are to be issued in a name other than that in which any Book Entry Interest is registered, it shall be a condition of such exchange that the Person requesting such exchange shall pay any transfer or other Taxes required by reason of the issuance of shares of ICE Common Stock in a name other than that of the registered holder of such Book Entry Interests, or shall establish to the satisfaction of ICE or the Exchange Agent that such Tax has been paid or is not applicable. 

   

 For the purposes of this Agreement, the term " _Person_ " shall mean any individual, corporation (including not-for-profit), general or limited partnership, limited liability company, joint venture, estate, trust, association, organization, Governmental Entity or Self-Regulatory Organization or other entity of any kind or nature.

additions, (ii) the term " _Tax Return_ " includes all returns and reports
(including elections, declarations, disclosures, schedules, estimates and
information returns) required to be filed with a Tax Authority relating to
Taxes, and (iii) the term " _Tax Authority_ " includes any Governmental
Entity responsible for the assessment, collection or enforcement of Laws
relating to Taxes (including the IRS and any similar state or local
revenue agency). 

  

 (c) _Distributions with Respect to Unexchanged Shares; Voting_. 

   

 (i) All shares of ICE Common Stock to be issued pursuant to the Merger shall be deemed issued and outstanding as of the Effective Time and whenever a dividend or other distribution is declared by ICE in respect of ICE Common Stock, the record date for which is at or after the Effective Time, that declaration shall include dividends or other distributions in respect of all shares issuable pursuant to this Agreement. No dividends or other distributions in respect of the ICE Common Stock shall be paid to any holder of any Book Entry Interests until the Instructions have been delivered to the Exchange Agent. Subject to the effect of applicable Laws, following delivery to the Exchange Agent of such Instructions, there shall be issued and/or paid to the holder of shares of ICE Common Stock issued in exchange for Membership Interests, without interest, (A) promptly after the time of such delivery of such Instructions, the dividends or other distributions with a record date after the Effective Time theretofore payable with respect to such whole shares of ICE Common Stock and not paid and (B) at the appropriate payment date, the dividends or other distributions payable with respect to such whole shares of ICE Common Stock with a record date after the Effective Time but with a payment date subsequent to such delivery. 

   

 (ii) Holders of Book Entry Interests in respect of which such Instructions have not been delivered shall be entitled to vote after the Effective Time at any meeting of ICE stockholders the number of whole shares of ICE Common Stock represented by such Book Entry Interests, regardless of whether such holders have delivered such Instructions to the Exchange Agent. 

   

 (d) _Transfers_. At or after the Effective Time, there shall be no transfers on the Member records of the Surviving Corporation of the Membership Interests that were outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time. 

   

 (e) _Fractional Shares_. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, no fractional shares of ICE Common Stock will be issued and any holder of Membership Interests entitled to receive a fractional share of ICE Common Stock but for this Section 4.4(e) shall be entitled to receive a cash payment in lieu thereof, which payment shall be calculated by the Exchange Agent and shall represent such holders proportionate interest in net proceeds from the sale by the Exchange Agent on behalf of all holders of the aggregate fractional shares of ICE Common Stock that such holders otherwise would be entitled to receive. Any such sale shall be made by the Exchange Agent within five business days after the date upon which the issuance of such fractional   ##### 

  

  

  

shares of ICE Common Stock would have otherwise occurred pursuant to the
Instructions received by the Exchange Agent. 

   

 (f) _Termination of Exchange Fund_. Any portion of the Exchange Fund (including the proceeds of any investments thereof) that remains unclaimed by the former Members of NYBOT for 180 days after the Effective Time shall be delivered to ICE. Any former Members of NYBOT who have not theretofore complied with this Article IV shall thereafter look only to ICE for delivery of evidence in book entry form of the issuance of shares of ICE Common Stock to such stockholders and payment of cash and any dividends and other distributions in respect of ICE Common Stock of such stockholders payable and/or issuable pursuant to Sections 4.1(a), 4.4(e) and 4.6 upon delivery to the Exchange Agent of the Instructions, without any interest thereon. Notwithstanding the foregoing, none of ICE, NYBOT, the Surviving Corporation, the Exchange Agent or any other Person shall be liable to any former holder of Membership Interests for any amount properly delivered to a public official pursuant to applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar Laws. 

   

 (g) _Affiliates_. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, Book Entry Interests in respect of which instructions for transfer and cancellation have been delivered to the Exchange Agent for exchange for the Merger Consideration by any Member that may be deemed to be an "affiliate" (as determined pursuant to Section 6.7 of this Agreement) of NYBOT shall not be exchanged until ICE has received an Affiliates Letter from such Person as provided in Section 6.7 of this Agreement. 

   

 4.5. _Adjustments_. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, if, between the date of this Agreement and the Effective Time, the issued and outstanding shares of ICE Common Stock or securities convertible or exchangeable into or exercisable for ICE Common Stock shall have been changed into a different number of shares or a different class by reason of any reclassification, stock split (including a reverse stock split), stock dividend or distribution, recapitalization, redenomination, issuer tender or exchange offer, or other similar transaction, then the Merger Consideration shall be equitably adjusted and as so adjusted shall, from and after the date of such event, be the Merger Consideration. 

   

 4.6. _Bonus Pool_. 

   

 (a) Prior to the Mailing Date, NYBOT shall deliver to ICE and the Exchange Agent, in writing, a schedule (the " _Allocation Schedule_ ") setting forth an allocation of up to an aggregate amount in cash and up to an aggregate number of shares of ICE Common Stock, in each case as set forth on Annex 4.6, to certain directors and employees of NYBOT and its Subsidiaries (in the aggregate, the " _Bonus Pool_ "). With respect to the Bonus Pool, the Allocation Schedule shall identify the full name and such other identifying information as ICE may reasonably request with respect to each of the directors and employees of NYBOT and its Subsidiaries that NYBOT desires to receive a portion of the Bonus Pool, together with details of the amount of cash (in the aggregate, the " _Awarded Cash Consideration_ " and number of shares of ICE Common Stock (in the aggregate, the " _Awarded Share Number_ ") in the Bonus Pool to be provided to each such   ##### 

  

  

  

director and employee. If any of the Bonus Pool has not been allocated to such
directors and employees of NYBOT, the amount of (i) any unallocated cash plus
(ii) any unallocated shares of ICE Common Stock shall be allocated to the
Members (the " _Members  Allocation_"). 

   

 (b) ICE shall cause the Exchange Agent to include in the transmittal materials to be provided to Members pursuant to Section 4.4(b) a notice of the amount of the aggregate Members Allocation divided by the number of Membership Interests then issued and outstanding (the " _Per Interest Additional Consideration_ "). The Per Interest Additional Consideration shall be payable to the Members in the relative proportions of cash and shares of ICE Common Stock in which such Member is entitled to receive the other Merger Consideration pursuant to Section 4.3, taking into account the Exchange Agents pro ration process pursuant to Section 4.3. The " _Per Interest Additional Cash Consideration_ " means the cash portion of such Per Interest Additional Consideration. The " _Per Interest Additional Stock Consideration_ " means the ICE Common Stock portion of such Per Interest Additional Consideration. 

   

 (c) Promptly after the Effective Time, ICE shall cause the Surviving Corporation to distribute the Awarded Cash Consideration and the Awarded Share Number to the directors and employees of NYBOT who are employed in such positions as of the Effective Time and who (other than those listed on Section 4.6(c) of the NYBOT Disclosure Letter) have executed a non-competition agreement in a form reasonably acceptable to ICE, substantially similar to ICEs standard non-competition agreements and having the limits set forth on Section 4.6(c) of the NYBOT Disclosure Letter in accordance with the Allocation Schedule; _provided_ , _however_ , that in no event shall ICE be required to distribute the Awarded Cash Consideration or the Awarded Share Number to the extent such distribution would not be fully deductible by ICE, NYBOT or the Surviving Corporation under Section 162(m) or Section 280G of the Code and any such Awarded Cash Consideration or Awarded Share Number not so distributed shall be treated as Members Allocation and promptly paid to Members using the procedures set forth in Section 4.6(b) hereof. 

   

 4.7. _Closing Cash Amount_. 

   

 (a) Within 30 days after the Closing Date, ICE shall prepare a calculation (the " _Calculation_ ") of the Closing Cash Amount. " _Closing Cash Amount_ " means the aggregate working capital of NYBOT and its Subsidiaries, on a consolidated basis, as of the Closing Date, as determined applying the same principles, practices, methodologies and policies used in the preparation of the sample calculation set forth on Section 4.7(a) of the NYBOT Disclosure Letter. 

   

 (b) The Closing Cash Amount _divided by_ the number of Membership Interests issued and outstanding as of the Effective Time shall be the " _Per Interest Excess Consideration_ ". 

   

 (c) Promptly after ICE prepares the Calculation (and in any event within 30 days after the Closing Date), ICE shall pay, or cause to be paid, to the former   ##### 

  

  

  

Members of NYBOT, with respect to each Membership Interest formerly held by
each such Member, the Per Interest Excess Consideration in cash. Any amount
payable pursuant to this Section 4.7(c) shall give effect to any required
Tax withholdings. To the extent ICE elects to engage the Exchange Agent, or
any other representative, in connection with the payments and issuances
pursuant to this Section 4.7(c), Section 4.4 will apply _mutatis mutandi_ to
the extent reasonably applicable. 

   

 (d) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement to the contrary, the Closing Cash Amount shall be payable in shares of ICE Common Stock (based on a price per share of ICE Common Stock determined based on the average closing price for the ten trading days ending on the business day immediately prior to the actual Closing Cash Amount payment date), but only to the extent necessary to cause the Merger to be treated for United States federal income tax purposes as a reorganization within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code. 

   

 (e) In the event that the Surviving Corporation, or its successors, assigns or Affiliates, receives any payment pursuant to Article 35 of the lease set forth on Section 4.7(e) of the NYBOT Disclosure Letter (the " _Lease Payment_ "), ICE shall pay, or cause to be paid, to each holder of a NYBOT Membership (as defined in the Bylaws) existing as of the date of any such Lease Payment, an amount equal to 60% of such Lease Payment divided by the total number of such NYBOT Memberships. Any amount payable pursuant to this Section 4.7(e) shall give effect to any required Tax withholdings. To the extent ICE elects to engage any representative in connection with payments pursuant to this Section 4.7(e), Section 4.4 will apply _mutatis mutandi_ to the extent reasonably applicable.

 (f) _NYBOT Reports; Financial Statements_.

Neither NYBOT nor any of its Subsidiaries files with any Governmental Entity or Self-Regulatory Organization any NYBOT Report. As of their respective dates (or if amended, as of the date of such amendment), the NYBOT Reports did not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements made therein, in light of the circumstances in which they were made, not misleading. NYBOT has delivered to ICE true and complete copies of the audited consolidated financial statements of NYBOT for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2005 (the " _NYBOT Audited Financial Statements_ ") and the unaudited consolidated financial statements of NYBOT for the six months ended June 30, 2006 (the " _NYBOT Interim Financial Statements_ " and, together with the NYBOT Audited Financial Statements, the " _NYBOT Financial Statements_ "). NYBOT has delivered to ICE a true and complete copy of the unaudited management report of NYBOT for the month ended July 31, 2006 (the " _Management Report_ ").

Except for liabilities and obligations incurred in the ordinary course of business since December 31, 2005, neither NYBOT nor any of its Subsidiaries has any liabilities or obligations of any nature required by GAAP to be set forth on a consolidated balance sheet of NYBOT or any of its Subsidiaries or in the notes thereto which, individually or in the aggregate, could reasonably be expected to have a NYBOT Material Adverse Effect. The NYBOT Financial Statements and the Management Report have been compiled from, and were prepared in accordance with, the books and records of NYBOT and its Affiliates. The books and records of NYBOT and its Affiliates are true, complete and correct in all material respects and have been maintained in accordance with sound business practices. NYBOT has designed and maintained a system of internal accounting controls sufficient to provide reasonable assurances regarding the reliability of financial   ##### 

  

  

  

reports and the preparation of annual financial statements for external
purposes in accordance with GAAP. 

   

 (g) _Absence of Certain Changes_. Since December 31, 2005, NYBOT and its Subsidiaries have conducted their respective businesses only in, and have not engaged in any material transaction other than according to, the ordinary and usual course of such businesses and there has not been (i) any change or development that, individually or in the aggregate, has had or is reasonably expected to have, a NYBOT Material Adverse Effect; (ii) any material damage, destruction or other casualty loss with respect to any material asset or property owned, leased or otherwise used by NYBOT or any of its Subsidiaries, whether or not covered by insurance; or (iii) any change by NYBOT in financial accounting principles, practices or methods that is not required by GAAP. Since December 31, 2005, except as provided for herein, there has not been any increase in the compensation payable or that could become payable by NYBOT or any of its Subsidiaries to officers or key employees or any amendment of or other modification to any of the NYBOT Benefit Plans other than increases or amendments in the ordinary and usual course consistent with past practice. 

   

 (h) _Compliance_. The businesses of NYBOT and each of its Subsidiaries have been conducted in compliance in all material respects with all Laws and the applicable rules of any Self-Regulatory Organization. Neither NYBOT nor any of its Subsidiaries is in conflict with, or in default or violation of, any Contract to which NYBOT or any of its Subsidiaries is a party or by which NYBOT or any of its Subsidiaries or its or any of their respective properties is bound or affected, except for any such conflicts, defaults or violations that, individually or in the aggregate, have not had and are not reasonably expected to have a NYBOT Material Adverse Effect. No investigation, review, audit or similar procedure by any Governmental Entity or any Self-Regulatory Organization with respect to NYBOT or any of its Subsidiaries is pending or, to the knowledge of NYBOT, threatened, nor has any Governmental Entity or any Self-Regulatory Organization indicated an intention to conduct the same, except, in each case, for those the outcome of which, individually or in the aggregate, have not had and are not reasonably expected to have a NYBOT Material Adverse Effect.

Each of NYBOT and its Subsidiaries has all permits, licenses, franchises, variances, exemptions, orders and other authorizations, consents and approvals (together, " _Permits_ ") of all Governmental Entities and Self-Regulatory Organizations necessary to conduct its business as presently conducted, except where the failure to have such Permits, individually or in the aggregate, has not had and is not reasonably expected to have a NYBOT Material Adverse Effect. 

    ##### 

  

     

 (i) _Litigation and Liabilities_. There are no (i) civil, criminal or administrative actions, suits, claims, hearings, investigations or proceedings pending or, to the knowledge of NYBOT, threatened against NYBOT, any of its Subsidiaries or any of their respective directors or officers, or (ii) obligations or liabilities, whether or not accrued, contingent or otherwise and whether or not required to be disclosed, including those relating to, or any other facts or circumstances of which, to the knowledge of NYBOT, could result in any claims against, or obligations or liabilities of, NYBOT or any of its Affiliates, except, in both cases, for those that, individually or in the aggregate, have not had and are not reasonably expected to have a NYBOT Material Adverse Effect. 

   

 (j) _Employee Benefits_. 

   

 (i) All benefit and compensation plans, contracts, policies or arrangements covering current or former employees of NYBOT and its Subsidiaries (the " _NYBOT Employees_ ") and current or former directors of NYBOT, in each case sponsored, maintained or contributed to by NYBOT or its Subsidiaries or with respect to which NYBOT or its Subsidiaries may have any liability, including, but not limited to, "employee benefit plans" within the meaning of Section 3(3) of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended (" _ERISA_ "), and deferred compensation, severance, stock option, stock purchase, stock appreciation rights, stock based, incentive and bonus plans (the " _NYBOT Benefit Plans_ ") are listed in Section 5.1(j) of the NYBOT Disclosure Letter, and each NYBOT Benefit Plan which has received a favorable opinion letter or favorable determination letter from the Internal Revenue Service National Office, including any master or prototype plan, has been separately identified. True and complete copies of all NYBOT Benefit Plans, including, but not limited to, any trust instruments, insurance contracts and, with respect to any employee stock ownership plan, loan agreements forming a part of any NYBOT Benefit Plans, and all amendments thereto, have been provided or made available to ICE. 

   

 (ii) All NYBOT Benefit Plans, other than "multiemployer plans" within the meaning of Section 3(37) of ERISA (each, an " _NYBOT Multiemployer Plan_ ") are in substantial compliance with ERISA and the Code and other applicable Laws. Each NYBOT Benefit Plan which is subject to ERISA (an " _NYBOT ERISA Plan_ ") that is an "employee pension benefit plan" within the meaning of Section 3(2) of ERISA (an " _NYBOT Pension Plan_ ") intended to be qualified under Section 401(a) of the Code, either (A) has received a favorable determination letter from the IRS covering all Tax law changes prior to the Economic Growth and Tax Relief Reconciliation Act of 2001 or has applied to the IRS for such favorable determination letter within the applicable remedial amendment period under Section 401(b) of the Code, and NYBOT is not aware of any circumstances likely to result in the loss of the qualification of any such NYBOT Pension Plan under Section 401(a) of the Code, or (B) is entitled to rely upon an opinion letter issued to the sponsor of a prototype plan. Neither NYBOT nor any of its Subsidiaries has engaged in a transaction with respect to any NYBOT ERISA Plan that, assuming the Taxable period of such transaction expired as of the date hereof, could subject NYBOT or any Subsidiary to a material Tax or penalty imposed by either Section 4975 of the Code or Section 502(i) of ERISA in an amount which would be material. Neither NYBOT nor any of its Subsidiaries has incurred or reasonably expects to incur a Tax or   ##### 

  

  

  

penalty imposed by Section 4980 of the Code or Section 502 of ERISA or any
material liability under Section 4071 of ERISA. 

   

 (iii) No liability under Subtitle C or D of Title IV of ERISA has been or is expected to be incurred by NYBOT or any of its Subsidiaries with respect to any ongoing, frozen or terminated "single-employer plan", within the meaning of Section 4001(a)(15) of ERISA, currently or formerly maintained by any of them, or the single-employer plan of any entity which is considered one employer with NYBOT under Section 4001 of ERISA or Section 414 of the Code (a "NYBOT ERISA Affiliate"). NYBOT and its Subsidiaries have not incurred and do not expect to incur any withdrawal liability with respect to a NYBOT Multiemployer Plan under Subtitle E of Title IV of ERISA (regardless of whether based on contributions of a NYBOT ERISA Affiliate). No notice of a "reportable event", within the meaning of Section 4043 of ERISA for which the reporting requirement has not been waived or extended, other than pursuant to Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation ("PBGC") Reg. Section 4043.33 or 4043.66, has been required to be filed for any NYBOT Pension Plan or by any NYBOT ERISA Affiliate within the 12-month period ending on the date hereof or will be required to be filed in connection with the transaction contemplated by this Agreement.

 (iv) All contributions required to be made under each NYBOT Benefit Plan, as of the date hereof, have been timely made and all obligations in respect of each NYBOT Benefit Plan have been properly accrued and reflected in the NYBOT Financial Statements except for contributions that individually or in the aggregate would not be material. Neither any NYBOT Pension Plan nor any single-employer plan of a NYBOT ERISA Affiliate has an "accumulated funding deficiency" (whether or not waived) within the meaning of Section 412 of the Code or Section 302 of ERISA and no NYBOT ERISA Affiliate has an outstanding funding waiver. Neither any NYBOT Pension Plan nor any single-employer plan of a NYBOT ERISA Affiliate has been required to file information pursuant to Section 4010 of ERISA for the current or most recently completed plan year. It is not reasonably anticipated that required minimum contributions to any NYBOT Pension Plan under Section 412 of the Code will be increased by application of Section 412(l) of the Code. Neither NYBOT nor any of its Subsidiaries has provided, or is required to provide, security to any NYBOT Pension Plan or to any single-employer plan of a NYBOT ERISA Affiliate pursuant to Section 401(a)(29) of the Code. 

   

 (v) Under each NYBOT Pension Plan which is a single-employer plan, as of the date hereof, the actuarially determined present value of all "benefit liabilities", within the meaning of Section 4001(a)(16) of ERISA (as determined on the basis of the actuarial assumptions contained in such NYBOT Pension Plans most recent actuarial valuation), did not exceed the then current value of the assets of such NYBOT Pension Plan, and there has been no change in the financial condition, whether or not as a result of a change in the funding method, of such NYBOT Pension Plan since the last day of the most recent plan year that would reasonably be expected to have a NYBOT Material Adverse Effect.   ##### 

  

  

   

 (vi) As of the date hereof, there is no material pending or, to the knowledge of NYBOT threatened, litigation relating to NYBOT Benefit Plans. Neither NYBOT nor any of its Subsidiaries has any obligations for retiree health and life benefits under any NYBOT ERISA Plan or collective bargaining agreement (other than COBRA continuation coverage pursuant to applicable Law). NYBOT or its Subsidiaries may amend or terminate any such plan at any time without incurring any liability thereunder other than in respect of claims incurred prior to such amendment or termination. 

   

 (vii) There has been no amendment to, announcement by NYBOT or any of its Subsidiaries relating to, or change in employee participation or coverage under, any NYBOT Benefit Plan which would increase materially the expense of maintaining such plan above the level of the expense incurred therefor for the most recent fiscal year. Neither the execution of this Agreement, Member approval of this Agreement nor the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby will (A) entitle any NYBOT Employees to severance pay or any increase in severance pay upon any termination of employment after the date hereof, (B) accelerate the time of payment or vesting or result in any payment or funding (through a grantor trust or otherwise) of compensation or benefits under, increase the amount payable or result in any other material obligation pursuant to, any of the NYBOT Benefit Plans, (C) limit or restrict the right of NYBOT or, after the consummation of the Merger or any other transactions contemplated hereby, ICE or any of its Subsidiaries to merge, amend or terminate any of the NYBOT Benefit Plans or (D) result in payments under any of NYBOT Benefit Plans which would not be deductible under Section 280G of the Code. 

   

 (k) _Tax Matters_. Neither NYBOT nor any of its Affiliates has taken or agreed to take any action, nor, to the knowledge of NYBOT, does there exist any fact or circumstance, that would prevent or impede, or would be reasonably likely to prevent or impede, the Merger from qualifying as a "reorganization" within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code.

apparent, ICE and Merger Sub hereby represent and warrant to NYBOT as set
forth in this Section 5.2. The mere inclusion of any item in the ICE

Each of the ICE Reports, at the time of its filing or being furnished complied, or if not yet filed or furnished, will comply in all material respects with the applicable requirements of the Securities Act, the Exchange Act and the 

    ##### 

  

    

Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (as amended, the " _Sarbanes-Oxley Act_ "), and
any rules and regulations promulgated thereunder applicable to the ICE
Reports. As of their respective dates (or, if amended prior to the date
hereof, as of the date of such amendment) the ICE Reports did not, and any
ICE Reports filed or furnished with the SEC subsequent to the date hereof
will not, contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state
a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the
statements made therein, in light of the circumstances in which they were
made, not misleading. Each of the consolidated balance sheets included in the
financial statements included in the ICE Reports (including the related notes
and schedules) fairly presents the consolidated financial position of ICE and
its Subsidiaries as of its date and each of the consolidated statements of
income, retained earnings, and cash flows and of changes in financial
position included in the financial statements included in the ICE Reports
(including any related notes and schedules) fairly presents the results of
operations, retained earnings, members equity, cash flows and changes in
financial position, as the case may be, of ICE and its Subsidiaries for
the periods set forth therein, in each case in conformity with GAAP
consistently applied during the periods involved, except as may be noted
therein. Except for liabilities and obligations incurred in the ordinary
course of business since December 31, 2005, neither ICE nor any of its
Subsidiaries has any liabilities or obligations of any nature required by
GAAP to be set forth on a consolidated balance sheet of ICE or any of its
Subsidiaries or in the notes thereto which, individually or in the aggregate,
could reasonably be expected to have a ICE Material Adverse Effect. 

   

 (g) _Absence of Certain Changes_. Since December 31, 2005, ICE and its Subsidiaries have conducted their respective businesses only in, and have not engaged in any material transaction other than according to, the ordinary and usual course of such businesses and there has not been (i) any change or development that, individually or in the aggregate, has had or is reasonably expected to have, a ICE Material Adverse Effect; or (ii) any change by ICE in financial accounting principles, practices or methods that is not required by GAAP. 

   

 (h) _Compliance_. The businesses of ICE and each of its Subsidiaries have been conducted in compliance in all material respects with all Laws and the applicable rules of any Self-Regulatory Organization. Neither ICE nor any of its Subsidiaries is in conflict with, or in default or violation of, any Contract to which ICE or any of its Subsidiaries is a party or by which ICE or any of its Subsidiaries or its or any of their respective properties is bound or affected, except for any such conflicts, defaults or violations that, individually or in the aggregate, would not reasonably be expected to prevent or materially impair or delay the consummation of the Merger. ICE is in compliance in all material respects with the applicable listing and corporate governance rules and regulations of the NYSE. 

   

 (i) _Litigation and Liabilities_. There are no (i) civil, criminal or administrative actions, suits, claims, hearings, investigations or proceedings pending or, to the knowledge of ICE, threatened against ICE, any of its Subsidiaries or any of their respective directors or officers or (ii) obligations or liabilities, whether or not accrued, contingent or otherwise and whether or not required to be disclosed, including those relating to, or any other facts or circumstances of which, to the knowledge of ICE, could 

    ##### 

  

    

result in any claims against, or obligations or liabilities of, ICE or any of
its Affiliates, except, in both cases, for those that, individually or in the
aggregate, have not had and are not reasonably expected to have a
ICE Material Adverse Effect or would not reasonably be expected to prevent or
materially impair or delay the consummation of the Merger. 

   

 (j) _Tax Matters_. Neither ICE nor any of its Affiliates has taken or agreed to take any action, nor, to the knowledge of ICE, does there exist any fact or circumstance, that would prevent or impede, or would be reasonably likely to prevent or impede, the Merger from qualifying as a "reorganization" within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code. 

   

 (k) _Brokers and Finders_. None of ICE, its Subsidiaries nor any of their respective officers, directors or employees has employed any broker or finder or incurred any liability for any brokerage fees, commissions or finders fees in connection with the Merger or the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement, except that ICE has employed Evercore Partners as its financial advisor.

those contained in the Confidentiality Agreement, and (v) in the case of

directors and representatives to, immediately cease and cause to be terminated
any activities, discussions or negotiations existing as of the date of this
Agreement with any parties conducted heretofore with respect to any
Acquisition Proposal. NYBOT shall use reasonable best efforts to promptly

 6.3. _Preparation of Proxy Statements; Information Supplied_. 

   

 (a) As promptly as reasonably practicable following the date hereof, ICE and NYBOT shall cooperate in preparing mutually acceptable proxy materials of NYBOT which shall constitute the proxy statement/prospectus relating to the matters to be submitted to the NYBOT Members at the NYBOT Members Meeting (such proxy statement/prospectus, and any amendments or supplements thereto, the " _Proxy Statement/Prospectus_ "), and ICE shall prepare and file with the SEC a registration statement on Form S-4 with respect to the issuance of ICE Common Stock in the Merger (such Form S-4, and any amendments or supplements thereto, the " _S-4 Registration Statement_ "). The Proxy Statement/Prospectus will be included as a prospectus in and will constitute a part of the S-4 Registration Statement as ICEs prospectus. 

   

 (b) Each of ICE and NYBOT shall use reasonable best efforts to have the S-4 Registration Statement declared effective by the SEC and to keep the S-4 Registration Statement effective as long as is necessary to consummate the Merger and the transactions contemplated thereby. ICE shall, as promptly as practicable after receipt thereof, provide NYBOT copies of any written comments and advise NYBOT of any oral comments received from the SEC with respect to the S-4 Registration Statement. The 

    ##### 

  

    

parties shall cooperate and provide the other with a reasonable opportunity
to review and comment on any amendment or supplement to the Proxy
Statement/Prospectus and the S-4 Registration Statement prior to filing such
with the SEC or providing such to the Members and will provide each other
with a copy of all such filings made with the SEC or provided to the
Members. 

   

 (c) Notwithstanding any other provision herein to the contrary, no amendment or supplement (including by incorporation by reference) to the Proxy Statement/Prospectus or the S-4 Registration Statement shall be made without the approval of both parties, which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed;  _provided_ that NYBOT, in connection with a Change in the NYBOT Recommendation, may amend or supplement the Proxy Statement/Prospectus pursuant to a Qualifying Amendment to effect such a Change, and in such event, this right of approval shall apply only with respect to information relating to the other party or its business, financial condition or results of operations, and shall be subject to the right of each party to have its Board of Directors deliberations and conclusions to be accurately described. A " _Qualifying Amendment_ " means an amendment or supplement to the Proxy Statement/Prospectus (including by incorporation by reference) to the extent that it contains (i) a Change in the NYBOT Recommendation, (ii) a statement of the reasons of the Board of Directors of NYBOT for making such Change in the NYBOT Recommendation and (iii) additional information reasonably related to the foregoing. 

   

 (d) NYBOT will use reasonable best efforts to cause the Proxy Statement/Prospectus to be mailed to NYBOTs Members as promptly as practicable after the S-4 Registration Statement is declared effective under the Securities Act. 

   

 (e) Each party will advise the other party, promptly after it receives notice thereof, of the time when the S-4 Registration Statement has become effective, the issuance of any stop order, the suspension of the qualification of the ICE Common Stock issuable in connection with the Merger for offering or sale in any jurisdiction, or any request by the SEC for amendment of the S-4 Registration Statement. 

   

 (f) ICE and NYBOT each agrees, as to itself and its Subsidiaries, that none of the information, supplied or to be supplied by it or its Subsidiaries and solely to the extent that such information pertains to it, its Subsidiaries, Affiliates, directors, officers, stockholders or Members, for inclusion or incorporation by reference in (i) the S-4 Registration Statement will, at the time the S-4 Registration Statement becomes effective under the Securities Act, contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, and (ii) the Proxy Statement/Prospectus and any amendment or supplement thereto will, at the date of mailing and at the time of the NYBOT Members Meeting, contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading. ICE will cause the S-4 Registration Statement to comply as to form in all material respects with the applicable provisions of the Securities Act and the rules and regulations thereunder. If at any time prior to the Effective Time 

    ##### 

  

    

any information relating to ICE or NYBOT, or any of their respective
Affiliates, officers or directors, should be discovered by ICE or NYBOT which
should be set forth in an amendment or supplement to any of the S-4
Registration Statement or the Proxy Statement/Prospectus so that any of such
documents would not include any misstatement of a material fact or omit to
state any material fact necessary to make the statements therein, in light of
the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, the party
which discovers such information shall promptly notify the other party hereto

Prior to the Effective Time, ICE shall purchase or permit NYBOT to purchase a six-year "tail" prepaid policy on terms and conditions no less advantageous to the insured than the current directors and officers liability insurance and fiduciary liability insurance maintained by NYBOT; _provided_ ,  _however_ , that in no event shall ICE or NYBOT expend for such "tail" policy a premium amount in excess of $1,500,000. The obligations of ICE under this Section 6.13 shall not be terminated or modified in such a manner as to adversely affect any indemnitee to whom this Section 6.13 applies without the consent of such affected indemnitee (it being expressly agreed that the indemnities to whom this Section 6.13 applies shall be third party beneficiaries of this Section 6.13).

 (b) From and after the Closing, ICE shall not amend, or cause to be amended, the NYBOT Subsidiary Organizational Documents of NYBOT Clearing Corporation in effect as of the Closing in a manner that would be inconsistent with the Core Rights (as defined in the Bylaws) without the approvals that would be required pursuant to Article XVI of the Bylaws if the Surviving Corporation were the entity seeking to take such action, only to the extent such approvals would be required.

 (a) if (i) NYBOT is not in breach in any material respect of Section 6.2 or in breach in any material respect of any other terms of this Agreement, (ii) the Board of Directors of NYBOT authorizes NYBOT, subject to complying with the terms of this Agreement, to enter into a binding written agreement providing for a transaction that constitutes a Superior Proposal and NYBOT notifies ICE in writing that it intends to enter into such an agreement, attaching the most current version of such agreement to such notice, which agreement shall include all of the material terms and conditions of such Superior Proposal, (iii) ICE does not make, within five business days of receipt of NYBOTs written notification pursuant to clause (ii), an offer that the Board of Directors of NYBOT determines, in good faith after consultation with its financial advisors and outside legal counsel, would cause the transaction that is the subject of NYBOTs written notification pursuant to clause (ii) above, in light of such offer, to no longer be a Superior Proposal and (iv) NYBOT shall have paid to ICE, in immediately available funds any fees required to be paid pursuant to Section 8.5; _provided_ , _however_ , that NYBOT agrees (x) that it will not enter into a binding agreement referred to in clause (ii) above until at least the sixth business day after it has provided the notice to ICE required under clause (ii) above; and (y) to notify ICE promptly if its intention to enter into a written agreement referred to in its notification shall change at any time after giving such notification; 

   

 (b) if ICE shall have breached in any material respect any of its representations or warranties contained in this Agreement or failed to perform in any material respect any of its covenants or agreements contained in this Agreement, which breach or failure to perform would render unsatisfied any condition in Section 7.2(a) or 7.2(b) and (i) is not curable or (ii) if curable, is not cured prior to the earlier of (A) the 

    ##### 

  

    

business day prior to the Termination Date or (B) the date that is 30 days
after written notice thereof is given by NYBOT to ICE. 

   

 8.5. _Effect of Termination and Abandonment; Termination Fee and Expense Reimbursement_. 

   

 (a) _Effect of Termination and Abandonment_. In the event of termination of this Agreement and the abandonment of the Merger pursuant to this Article VIII, this Agreement (other than as set forth in Section 9.1) shall become void and of no effect with no liability on the part of any party hereto (or of any of its directors, officers, employees, agents, legal and financial advisors or other representatives); _provided,_ _however_ , except as otherwise provided herein, that no such termination shall relieve any party hereto of any liability or damages resulting from any willful or intentional breach of this Agreement. 

   

 (b) _Termination Fee and Expense Reimbursement by NYBOT_. 

   

 (i) In the event that this Agreement is terminated by NYBOT, pursuant to (A) Section 8.2(a) (Drop-Dead Date) and, at such time, ICE would have been permitted to terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 8.3(a) (NYBOT Change in Recommendation), or (B) Section 8.4(a) (Superior Proposal Out), then NYBOT shall, prior to such termination, pay ICE a termination fee of $39 million (the " _Termination Fee_ ") and shall reimburse ICE for its out-of-pocket expenses up to $5 million (the " _Expense Reimbursement_ " and, together with the Termination Fee, the " _Aggregate Break-Up Amount_ "), in each case by wire transfer of same day funds. 

   

 (ii) In the event that this Agreement is terminated by ICE pursuant to Section 8.3(a) (NYBOT Change in Recommendation), then NYBOT shall promptly, but in no event later than two days after the date of such termination, pay ICE the Aggregate Break-Up Amount by wire transfer of same day funds. 

   

 (iii) In the event that an Acquisition Proposal shall have been made (and not subsequently withdrawn) to NYBOT or any of its Subsidiaries or any Person shall have publicly announced (and not subsequently withdrawn) a bona fide intention (whether or not conditional) to make an Acquisition Proposal with respect to NYBOT or any of its Subsidiaries and thereafter this Agreement is terminated: 

   

       | (A)  |   | by either ICE or NYBOT pursuant to (x) Section
8.2(b) (NYBOT Requisite Vote) or (y) Section 8.2(a) (Drop Dead Date) and, at
such time, the vote of the NYBOT Members to approve this Agreement has not
been taken and the only condition set forth in Article VII that has not been
satisfied (other than those conditions by their nature are to be satisfied at
Closing) is the failure to have received the NYBOT Requisite Vote; or  
---|---|---|--- 
      
    | (B)  |   | by ICE pursuant to Section 8.3(b) (NYBOT Breach of
Covenant) or Section 8.3(c) (NYBOT Breach of Non-Solicit);  
   

  ##### 

  

   

     

 

then, in each of cases (A) and (B), NYBOT shall promptly, but in no event
later than two days after the date of such termination, pay the Expense
Reimbursement to ICE and, if within 9 months of such termination (x) any
Person (other than ICE) has acquired (or has entered into any Contract
with NYBOT or any of its Subsidiaries providing for such acquisition), by
purchase, merger, consolidation, sale, assignment, lease, transfer or
otherwise, in one transaction or any related series of transactions, a
majority of the voting power of or economic interest in the
outstanding Membership Interests or other equity securities of NYBOT or a
majority of the consolidated assets of NYBOT and its Subsidiaries, taken as a
whole, or (y) there has been consummated a merger, consolidation or similar
business combination between NYBOT and any Person (other than ICE)
after which the NYBOT Members do not hold a majority of the voting power or
economic interest in the surviving or successor company, then NYBOT shall,
prior to the completion of such acquisition or transaction (or, if earlier,
the entry into such Contract), pay the Termination Fee to ICE, by
wire transfer of same day funds. 

   

 (c) _Interest_. NYBOT acknowledges that the agreements contained in this Section 8.5 are an integral part of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and that, without these agreements, ICE would not enter into this Agreement; accordingly, if NYBOT fails to promptly pay the amount due pursuant to this Section 8.5, and, in order to obtain such payment, ICE commences a suit that results in a judgment against NYBOT for the fee set forth in this Section 8.5 or any portion of such fee, NYBOT shall pay the other party its costs and expenses (including attorneys fees) in connection with such suit, together with interest on the amount of the fee at the prime rate plus 200 basis points in effect on the date such payment was required to be paid, from the date such payment was required through the date of payment.
