ARTICLE II 
 EFFECT OF THE MERGER ON THE CAPITAL STOCK OF THE COMPANY AND 
 MERGER SUB; EXCHANGE OF CERTIFICATES AND PAYMENT 

   

 2.1 _Effect of the Merger on Capital Stock_. At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of any party or the holder of any of their securities: 

  

 (a) _LLC Interest of Merger Sub_. All of the outstanding limited liability company interests in Merger Sub issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall remain issued and outstanding and unchanged so that, after the Effective Time, Parent shall be the holder of all of the issued and outstanding limited liability company interests of the Surviving Entity. 

       ##### 

  

     

 (b) _Capital Stock of the Company_. At the Effective Time, subject to Section 2.1(c) and the other provisions of this Agreement, each share of Company Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (including any Company Restricted Stock, as defined in Section 2.3(b), but excluding any Excluded Shares and any Appraisal Shares) shall, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of the holder thereof, be converted into and shall thereafter represent the right to receive the following consideration: 

    

 (i) Each share of Company Common Stock (including any Company Restricted Stock, but excluding any Excluded Shares) with respect to which an election to receive a combination of stock and cash has been effectively made and not revoked or lost pursuant to Section 2.1(d) (each, a " _Mixed Consideration Election Share_ ") and each Non-Election Share, as defined in Section 2.1(d), shall be converted into the right to receive the combination (such combination, the " _Per Share Mixed Consideration_ ") of (x) $1.73 in cash (the " _Per Share Mixed Election Cash Amount_ ") and (y) a number of validly issued, fully paid and non-assessable shares of common stock, par value $2.50 per share, of Parent (" _Parent Common Stock_ "), (together with any cash in lieu of fractional shares of Parent Common Stock to be paid pursuant to Section 2.4(e)) equal to the quotient (the " _Mixed Election Stock Exchange Ratio_ ") determined by dividing $1.27 (" _Per Share Mixed Election Stock Amount_ ") by the volume weighted average price per share of Parent Common Stock for the period of five consecutive trading days ending on the second full trading day immediately prior to the Effective Time and rounding to the nearest ten-thousandth of a share, for sales conducted regular way on the New York Stock Exchange (" _NYSE_ "), as such volume weighted average price is calculated on the VAP screen on the Bloomberg Professional  Service and shown as VWAP for such period or, if not calculated thereby, another authoritative source (the " _Parent Share Value_ "), and rounding to the nearest ten-thousandth of a share. 

   

 (ii) If the Available Cash Election Amount equals or exceeds the Cash Election Amount (each as defined below), then each share of Company Common Stock (including any Company Restricted Stock, but excluding any Excluded Shares) with respect to which an election to receive cash has been effectively made and not revoked or lost pursuant to Section 2.1(d) (each, a " _Cash Election Share_ ") shall be converted into the right to receive $3.00 in cash without interest (the " _Per Share Cash Election Consideration_ "). If (A) the product of the number of Cash Election Shares and the Per Share Cash Election Consideration (such product being the " _Cash Election Amount_ ") exceeds (B) the product of (x) the Per Share Mixed Election Cash Amount and (y) the difference between (1) the total number of shares of Company Common Stock (including any Company Restricted Stock, but excluding any Excluded Shares) issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time minus (2) the number of Mixed Consideration Election Shares (provided that Non-Election Shares shall be deemed to be Mixed Consideration Election Shares for purposes of this Section 2.1(b)(ii)) (such product being the " _Available Cash Election Amount_ "), then each Cash Election Share shall be converted into a right to receive (1) an amount of cash (without interest) equal to the product of (p) the Per Share Cash Election Consideration and (q) a fraction, the numerator of which shall be the Available Cash Election Amount and the denominator of which shall be the Cash Election Amount (such fraction being the " _Cash Fraction_ ") and (2) a number of validly issued, fully paid and non-assessable shares of Parent Common 

   ##### 

  

    

Stock equal to the product of (r) the Exchange Ratio and (s) one minus the
Cash Fraction, and rounding to the nearest ten-thousandth of a share. 

   

 (iii) If the Cash Election Amount equals or exceeds the Available Cash Election Amount, then each share of Company Common Stock (including any Company Restricted Stock, but excluding any Excluded Shares) with respect to which an election to receive stock consideration is properly made and not revoked or lost pursuant to Section 2.1(d) (each, a " _Stock Election Share_ ") shall be converted into the right to receive a number of validly issued, fully paid and non-assessable shares of Parent Common Stock (together with any cash in lieu of fractional shares of Parent Common Stock to be paid pursuant to Section 2.4(e) (the " _Per Share Stock Election Consideration_ ")), equal to the quotient (the " _Exchange Ratio_ ") determined by dividing $3.00 by the Parent Share Value, and rounding to the nearest ten-thousandth of a share. If the Available Cash Election Amount exceeds the Cash Election Amount, then each Stock Election Share shall be converted into the right to receive (1) an amount of cash (without interest) equal to the amount of such excess divided by the number of Stock Election Shares and (2) a number of validly issued, fully paid and non-assessable shares of Parent Common Stock equal to the product of (x) the Exchange Ratio and (y) a fraction, the numerator of which shall be the Per Share Cash Election Consideration minus the amount calculated in clause (1) of this paragraph and the denominator of which shall be the Per Share Cash Election Consideration, and rounding to the nearest ten-thousandth of a share. 

  

 (c) _Election Adjustments_. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary: 

    

 (i) to the fullest extent permitted by Law, for purposes of determining the allocations set forth in Section 2.1(b), Parent shall have the right to require, but not the obligation to require (unless such requirement is necessary to satisfy the conditions set forth in Section 6.2(c) or Section 6.3(d)), that any shares of Company Common Stock that constitute Appraisal Shares as of the Election Deadline be treated as Cash Election Shares not subject to the pro rata selection process contemplated by Section 2.1(b), including the second sentence of Section 2.1(b)(ii), and, if Parent so requires, then, to the fullest extent permitted by Law, such Appraisal Shares shall be treated as Cash Election Shares not subject to the pro rata selection process contemplated by Section 2.1(b) and the Merger Consideration will be adjusted accordingly, including the deduction of the aggregate amount payable attributable to the Appraisal Shares from the Available Cash Election Amount; and 

   

 (ii) if and to the minimum extent necessary to satisfy the conditions set forth in Sections 6.2(c) and 6.3(d), the Per Share Mixed Election Cash Amount shall be decreased, and the Per Share Mixed Election Stock Amount shall be correspondingly increased; provided that the sum of the Per Share Mixed Election Cash Amount and the Per Share Mixed Election Stock Amount shall at all times equal $3.00. 

  

 (d) _Election Procedures_. 

       ##### 

  

      

 (i) Not less than 30 days prior to the anticipated Effective Time, an election form and other appropriate and customary transmittal materials (which shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to any certificate (a " _Certificate_ ") theretofore representing shares of Company Common Stock or non-certificated shares represented by book entry (" _Book Entry Shares_ ") shall pass, only upon proper delivery of such Certificates or Book Entry Shares, respectively, to the Exchange Agent), in such form as Parent shall specify and as shall be reasonably acceptable to the Company (the " _Election Form_ "), shall be mailed at such time as the Company and Parent may agree (the " _Mailing Date_ ") to each holder of record of shares of Company Common Stock as of the close of business on the record date for notice of the Company Stockholder Meeting (the " _Election Form Record Date_"). 

   

 (ii) Each Election Form shall permit the holder (or the beneficial owner through appropriate and customary documentation and instructions), other than any holder of any Excluded Shares or any Appraisal Shares, to specify (i) the number of shares of such holders Company Common Stock with respect to which such holder elects to receive the Per Share Mixed Consideration, (ii) the number of shares of such holders Company Common Stock with respect to which such holder elects to receive the Per Share Stock Election Consideration, (iii) the number of shares of such holders Company Common Stock with respect to which such holder elects to receive the Per Share Cash Election Consideration, or (iv) that such holder makes no election with respect to such holders Company Common Stock (" _Non-Election Shares_ "). Any Company Common Stock with respect to which the Exchange Agent has not received an effective, properly completed Election Form on or before 5:00 p.m., New York time, on the 20th day following the Mailing Date (or such other time and date as the Company and Parent shall agree) (the " _Election Deadline_ ") (other than any shares of Company Common Stock that constitute Appraisal Shares as of such time) shall also be deemed to be Non-Election Shares. 

   

 (iii) Parent shall make available one or more Election Forms as may reasonably be requested from time to time by all Persons who become holders (or beneficial owners) of Company Common Stock between the Election Form Record Date and the close of business on the Business Day prior to the Election Deadline, and the Company shall provide to the Exchange Agent all information reasonably necessary for it to perform as specified herein. 

   

 (iv) Any election shall have been properly made only if the Exchange Agent shall have received a properly completed Election Form by the Election Deadline. An Election Form shall be deemed properly completed only (A) if accompanied by one or more Certificates (or customary affidavits and, if required by Parent or the Surviving Entity, the posting by such Person of a bond, in such reasonable amount as the Surviving Entity may direct, as indemnity against any claim that may be made against it with respect to such Certificate) and/or (B) upon receipt of an "agents message" by the Exchange Agent or such other evidence of transfer of Book Entry Shares to the Exchange Agent as the Exchange Agent may reasonably request, collectively representing all shares of Company Common Stock covered by such Election Form, together with duly executed transmittal materials included in the Election Form. Any Election Form may be revoked 

   ##### 

  

    

or changed by the Person submitting such Election Form by written notice
received by the Exchange Agent prior to the Election Deadline. In the event
an Election Form is revoked prior to the Election Deadline, the shares of
Company Common Stock represented by such Election Form shall become Non-
Election Shares and Parent shall cause the Certificates representing such
shares of Company Common Stock or Book Entry Shares to be promptly returned
without charge to the Person submitting the Election Form upon written request
to that effect from the holder who submitted the Election Form, except to the
extent (if any) a subsequent election is properly made with respect to any or
all of such shares of Company Common Stock. Subject to the terms of this
Agreement and of the Election Form, Parent shall have sole discretion, which
it may delegate in whole or in part to the Exchange Agent, to determine
whether any election, revocation or change has been properly or timely made
and to disregard immaterial defects in the Election Forms, and any good faith
decisions of Parent (or the Exchange Agent, if so empowered) regarding such
matters shall be binding and conclusive. None of Parent, Merger Sub or the
Exchange Agent shall be under any obligation to notify any Person of any
defect in an Election Form. 

  

 (e) _Cancellation of Shares_. Shares of Company Common Stock, when converted in accordance with Section 2.1(b), shall cease to be outstanding and shall automatically be canceled and cease to exist, and each holder of a Certificate or Book Entry Share shall cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except the right to receive in respect of each share of Company Common Stock previously represented thereby (i) the consideration set forth in Section 2.1(b), (ii) any dividends or other distributions in accordance with Section 2.4(c), and (iii) any cash to be paid in lieu of any fractional shares of Parent Common Stock in accordance with Section 2.4(e), in each case without interest (collectively, the " _Merger Consideration_ "), and in each case to be issued or paid in consideration therefor upon the surrender of such Certificate or Book Entry Share in accordance with Section 2.4. 

   

 (f) _Treasury Stock_. All shares of Company Common Stock held by the Company as treasury shares or by Parent or Merger Sub or by any wholly-owned Subsidiary of Parent, Merger Sub or the Company immediately prior to the Effective Time shall automatically be canceled and cease to exist as of the Effective Time and no consideration shall be delivered or deliverable therefor (all such shares, the " _Excluded Shares_ "). 

   

 2.2 _Appraisal Rights_. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, if appraisal rights are available under Delaware law, shares of Company Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time that are held by any record holder who is entitled to demand and properly demands appraisal of such shares pursuant to, and who complies in all respects with, the provisions of Section 262 of the DGCL (the " _Appraisal Shares_ ") shall not be converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration payable pursuant to Section 2.1, but instead at the Effective Time shall become the right to payment of the fair value of such shares in accordance with the provisions of Section 262 of the DGCL and, at the Effective Time, all Appraisal Shares shall no longer be outstanding and shall automatically be canceled and cease to exist. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if any such holder shall fail to perfect or otherwise shall waive, withdraw or lose the right to appraisal under Section 262 of the DGCL or a court of competent jurisdiction shall determine that such holder is not entitled to the relief provided by Section 262 of the DGCL, then the right of such holder to be paid the fair value of such holders 

   ##### 

  

 

Appraisal Shares under Section 262 of the DGCL shall be forfeited and cease
and if such forfeiture shall occur following the Election Deadline, each of
such holders Appraisal Shares shall be deemed to have been converted at the
Effective Time into, and shall have become, the right to receive, without
interest thereon, the Merger Consideration pursuant to Section 2.1. The
Company shall deliver prompt notice to Parent of any demands for appraisal of
any shares of Company Common Stock and provide Parent with the opportunity to
participate in all negotiations and proceedings with respect to demands for
appraisal under the DGCL. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall not,
without the prior written consent of Parent, voluntarily make any payment with
respect to, or settle or offer to settle, any such demands, or agree to do
any of the foregoing. 

   

 2.3 _Treatment of Stock Options, Stock Appreciation Rights and Restricted Stock_. 

  

 (a) Each outstanding option to purchase shares of Company Common Stock and each stock appreciation right with respect to a share of Company Common Stock granted under the Companys 2000 Long Term Incentive Plan, 2004 Long-Term Incentive Plan and 2006 Non-Employee Director Stock Incentive Plan (together with any other plan pursuant to which any equity-based incentive awards are outstanding as of the date hereof, the " _Stock Plans_ "), whether or not vested (a " _Company Option_ "), shall be treated as follows as of the Effective Time. The Company shall cause, as of the Effective Time, (i) any Company Option that has an exercise price per share that is equal to or greater than $3.00 to be cancelled for no consideration and (ii) any Company Option that has an exercise price per share that is less than $3.00 (the " _In-the-Money Company Options_ ") to be cancelled and converted into the right to receive, from the Surviving Entity, within two Business Days following the Effective Time, an amount in cash (less any applicable withholding Taxes and without interest) equal to the product of (i) the excess of (A) $3.00 over (B) the per share exercise price of Company Common Stock subject to such In-the-Money Company Option, multiplied by (ii) the number of shares of Company Common Stock subject to such In-the-Money Company Option immediately prior to the Effective Time (whether or not vested). As of the Effective Time, all Company Options shall no longer be outstanding and shall automatically cease to exist, and each holder of a Company Option shall cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except, with respect to In-the-Money Company Options, the right to receive the payment described in the immediately preceding sentence. 

   

 (b) As of the Effective Time, the restrictions on each restricted share of Company Common Stock (collectively, the " _Company Restricted Stock_ ") granted and then outstanding under the Stock Plans shall, without any action on the part of the holder thereof, lapse immediately prior to the Effective Time, and each such share of Company Restricted Stock shall be fully vested in each holder thereof at such time, and each such share of Company Restricted Stock will be treated at the Effective Time the same as, and have the same rights and be subject to the same conditions as, each share of Company Common Stock not subject to any restrictions; provided, that upon vesting the holder may satisfy any applicable withholding Tax obligations by returning to the Surviving Entity or Parent a sufficient number of shares of Company Common Stock equal in value (at $3.00 per share) to such obligation. 

   

 2.4 _Exchange of Company Common Stock_. 

   ##### 

  

  

 (a) _Exchange Agent_. Prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall deposit, or shall cause to be deposited, with the Companys transfer agent or a bank or trust company designated by Parent (the " _Exchange Agent_ "), for the benefit of the holders of shares of Company Common Stock, for exchange in accordance with this Article II, through the Exchange Agent, sufficient cash and Parent Common Stock to make pursuant to this Article II all deliveries of cash and Parent Common Stock as required by this Article II. Parent agrees to make available to the Exchange Agent, from time to time as needed, cash sufficient to pay any dividends and other distributions pursuant to Section 2.4(c) and to make payments in lieu of fractional shares pursuant to Section 2.4(e). Any cash and Parent Common Stock deposited with the Exchange Agent (including as payment for any dividends or other distributions in accordance with Section 2.4(c) and fractional shares in accordance with Section 2.4(e)) shall hereinafter be referred to as the " _Exchange Fund_." The Exchange Agent shall, pursuant to irrevocable instructions, deliver the Merger Consideration contemplated to be paid for shares of Company Common Stock pursuant to this Agreement out of the Exchange Fund. The Exchange Agent shall invest any cash included in the Exchange Fund as directed by Parent, provided that no such investment or losses thereon shall affect the amount of Merger Consideration payable to the holders of shares of Company Common Stock or Company Options. Any interest and other income resulting from such investments shall be paid to Parent. Except as contemplated by this Agreement, the Exchange Fund shall not be used for any other purpose. 

  

 (b) _Exchange Procedures_. Promptly after the Effective Time, Parent shall instruct the Exchange Agent to mail to each record holder, as of the Effective Time, of an outstanding Certificate or Book Entry Share that immediately prior to the Effective Time represented shares of Company Common Stock (i) a letter of transmittal (which shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the shares of Company Common Stock shall pass, only upon proper delivery of the corresponding Certificates to the Exchange Agent or receipt by the Exchange Agent of an "agents message" with respect to Book Entry Shares, and shall be in customary form as directed by Parent and reasonably acceptable to the Company) and (ii) instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the Certificates or Book Entry Shares in exchange for the Merger Consideration payable in respect of the shares of Company Common Stock represented thereby. Promptly after the Effective Time, upon surrender of Certificates or Book Entry Shares for cancellation to the Exchange Agent together with such letters of transmittal, properly completed and duly executed, and such other documents as may be required pursuant to such instructions, the holders of such Certificates or Book Entry Shares and the holders of Certificates or Book Entry Shares who previously surrendered Certificates or Book Entry Shares to the Exchange Agent with properly completed and duly executed Election Forms shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor, upon completion of the calculations required by Section 2.1, (A) shares of Parent Common Stock representing, in the aggregate, the whole number of shares of Parent Common Stock that such holder has the right to receive pursuant to Section 2.1 (after taking into account all shares of Company Common Stock then held by such holder) and (B) a check in the amount equal to the aggregate amount of cash that such holder has the right to receive pursuant to Section 2.1, dividends and other distributions pursuant to Section 2.4(c) and cash payable in lieu of any fractional shares of Parent Common Stock pursuant to Section 2.4(e). No interest shall be paid or accrued on any Merger Consideration. In the event of a transfer of ownership of shares of Company Common Stock which is not registered in the transfer records of the Company, the Merger Consideration payable in respect of such shares of Company Common Stock may be paid to a transferee if the Certificate representing such shares 

   ##### 

  

    

of Company Common Stock is presented to the Exchange Agent, accompanied by all
documents required to evidence and effect such transfer and the Person
requesting such exchange shall pay to the Exchange Agent in advance any
transfer or other Taxes required by reason of the delivery of the Merger
Consideration in any name other than that of the registered holder of the
Certificate surrendered, or shall establish to the satisfaction of the
Exchange Agent that such Taxes have been paid or are not payable. 

  

 (c) _Distributions with Respect to Unexchanged Parent Common Stock_. No dividends or other distributions declared or made with respect to Parent Common Stock with a record date after the Effective Time shall be paid to the holder of any unsurrendered Certificate or Book Entry Share with respect to the Parent Common Stock that such holder would be entitled to receive upon surrender of such Certificate or Book Entry Share and no cash payment in lieu of fractional shares of Parent Common Stock shall be paid to any such holder until such holder shall surrender such Certificate or Book Entry Share in accordance with this Section 2.4. Subject to applicable Law, following surrender of any such Certificate or Book Entry Share, there shall be paid to such holder of Parent Common Stock issuable in exchange therefor, without interest, (i) promptly after the time of such surrender, the amount of any cash due pursuant to Section 2.1 and cash payable in lieu of fractional shares of Parent Common Stock to which such holder is entitled pursuant to Section 2.4(e) and the amount of dividends or other distributions with a record date after the Effective Time theretofore paid with respect to such holders whole shares of Parent Common Stock, and (ii) at the appropriate payment date, the amount of dividends or other distributions with a record date after the Effective Time but prior to such surrender and a payment date subsequent to such surrender payable with respect to such holders whole shares of Parent Common Stock. 

  

 (d) _Further Rights in Company Common Shares_. The Merger Consideration issued upon conversion of a share of Company Common Stock in accordance with the terms hereof (including any cash paid pursuant to Section 2.4(c) or Section 2.4(e)) shall be deemed to have been issued in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to such share of Company Common Stock. 

  

 (e) _Fractional Shares_. No certificates or scrip or Parent Common Stock representing fractional shares of Parent Common Stock or book entry credit of the same shall be issued upon the surrender for exchange of Certificates or Book Entry Shares, no dividend or other distribution, stock split or interest shall relate to any such fractional share and such fractional share shall not entitle the owner thereof to vote or to have any rights as a holder of any Parent Common Stock. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, each holder of shares of Company Common Stock exchanged in the Merger who would otherwise have been entitled to receive a fraction of a share of Parent Common Stock (after taking into account all Certificates and Book Entry Shares delivered by such holder) shall receive, in lieu thereof, cash (without interest) in an amount, rounded to the nearest whole cent, equal to the product of (i) the Parent Share Value and (ii) the fraction of a share of Parent Common Stock that such holder would otherwise be entitled to receive pursuant to Section 2.1 hereof. 

  

 (f) _Termination of Exchange Fund_. Any portion of the Exchange Fund that remains undistributed to the holders of Company Common Stock after 180 days following the Effective Time shall be delivered to Parent upon demand and, from and after such delivery to 

   ##### 

  

    

Parent, any former holders of Company Common Stock (other than Appraisal
Shares) who have not theretofore complied with this _Article II_ shall
thereafter look only to Parent for the Merger Consideration payable in
respect of such shares of Company Common Stock. Any amounts remaining
unclaimed by holders of shares of Company Common Stock immediately prior to
such time as such amounts would otherwise escheat to or become the property
of any Governmental Entity shall, to the extent permitted by applicable Law,
become the property of Parent free and clear of any Liens, claims or interest
of any Person previously entitled thereto. 

  

 (g) _No Liability_. Neither Parent nor the Surviving Entity shall be liable to any holder of shares of Company Common Stock for any shares of Parent Common Stock (or dividends or distributions with respect thereto) or cash from the Exchange Fund delivered to a public official or Governmental Entity pursuant to any abandoned property, escheat or similar law. 

  

 (h) _Lost Certificates_. If any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the Person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed in form and substance acceptable to Parent and, if required by Parent, the posting by such Person of a bond, in such reasonable amount as Parent may direct, as indemnity against any claim that may be made against it with respect to such Certificate, the Exchange Agent shall pay in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate the Merger Consideration payable in respect of the shares of Company Common Stock represented by such Certificate. 

  

 (i) _Withholding_. Except as contemplated by Section 2.3(b), each of Parent, the Surviving Entity and the Exchange Agent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the consideration otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement to any holder of Company Common Stock, Company Options or Company Restricted Stock such amounts as Parent, the Surviving Entity or the Exchange Agent is required to deduct and withhold under the Code or any provision of state, local, or foreign Tax law, with respect to the making of such payment. To the extent that amounts are so withheld by Parent, the Surviving Entity or the Exchange Agent, such withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the holder of Company Common Stock, Company Option or Company Restricted Stock in respect of whom such deduction and withholding was made by Parent, the Surviving Entity or the Exchange Agent, as the case may be. 

  

 (j) _Book Entry_. All shares of Parent Common Stock to be issued in the Merger shall be issued in book entry form, without physical certificates. 

  

 2.5 _Stock Transfer Books_. At the close of business on the date on which the Effective Time occurs, the stock transfer books of the Company shall be closed and thereafter there shall be no further registration of transfers of shares of Company Common Stock theretofore outstanding on the records of the Company. From and after the close of business on the date on which the Effective Time occurs, any Certificates or Book Entry Shares presented to the Exchange Agent, Parent or the Surviving Entity for any reason shall represent the right to receive the Merger Consideration payable in respect of the shares of Company Common Stock represented thereby. 

   ##### 

  

  

 2.6 _Certain Adjustments_. If, after the date of this Agreement and at or prior to the Effective Time, the outstanding shares of Parent Common Stock or Company Common Stock are changed into a different number of shares or type of securities by reason of any reclassification, recapitalization, split-up, stock split, subdivision, combination or exchange of shares, or any dividend payable in stock or other securities is declared thereon or rights issued in respect thereof with a record date within such period, or any similar event occurs (any such action, an " _Adjustment Event_ "), the Merger Consideration will be adjusted accordingly to provide to the holders of Company Common Stock and Company Options the same economic effect as contemplated by this Agreement prior to such Adjustment Event. 

  

 2.7 _Associated Rights_. References in this Agreement to Company Common Stock shall include, unless the context requires otherwise, the associated rights (the " _Company Rights_ ") distributed to the holders of Company Common Stock pursuant to the Rights Agreement dated as of November 17, 2001 (the " _Company Rights Agreement_ ").

Since January 1, 2008, neither the Company nor its independent auditors have identified any "significant deficiencies" or "material weaknesses" in the Companys or any of its Subsidiaries internal controls as contemplated under Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 ("SOX"). To the knowledge of the Company, it has disclosed, based on its most recent evaluations, to the Companys outside auditors and the audit committee of the board of directors of the Company (A) all significant deficiencies in the design or operation of internal control over financial reporting and any material weaknesses, which have more than a remote chance to materially adversely affect the Companys ability to record, process, summarize and report financial data (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) of the Exchange Act) and (B) any fraud, whether or not material, that involves management or other employees who have a significant role in the Companys internal control over financial reporting. 

   

 (b) Since January 1, 2008, to the knowledge of the Company, none of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or any director, officer, employee, auditor, accountant or representative of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries has received or otherwise had or obtained knowledge of any material complaint, allegation, assertion or claim, whether written or oral, regarding the accounting or auditing practices, procedures, methodologies or methods of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, including any material complaint, allegation, assertion or claim that the Company or any of its Subsidiaries has a "significant deficiency" or "material weakness" (as such terms are defined in the Public Company Accounting Oversight Boards Auditing Standard No. 2, as in effect on the date hereof), in the Companys or such Subsidiarys internal control over financial reporting. 

   

 (c) Each of the "principal executive officer" of the Company (as defined in SOX) and the "principal financial officer" of the Company (as defined in SOX) has made all certifications required by Sections 302 and 906 of SOX and any related rules and regulations promulgated by the SEC and the NYSE (including the NYSE Amex) and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder with respect to the Company SEC Documents and the statements contained in any such certifications were true and accurate as of the date such certifications were made and have not been modified or withdrawn. Neither the Company nor any of its executive officers has received notice from any Governmental Entity challenging or questioning the accuracy, completeness, form or manner of filing of the certifications required by SOX and made by its principal executive officer and principal financial officer. 

   

 (d) The Company is in material compliance with all applicable provisions of SOX and the applicable listing and governance rules of the NYSE (including the NYSE Amex).

Each such policy is in full force and effect, is in such amount and covers such losses and risks as is reasonable, in the judgment of senior management of the Company, to protect the properties and businesses of the Company and its Subsidiaries, and all premiums due under each such policy have been paid. With respect to each such insurance policy, none of the Company, any of its Subsidiaries or, to the Companys knowledge, any other party to the policy is in breach or default thereunder (including with respect to the payment of premiums or the giving of notices), and the Company does not know of any occurrence or any event which (with notice or the lapse of time or both) would constitute such a breach or default or permit termination, modification or acceleration under the policy, except for such breaches or defaults which have not had or could not reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect.

 (d) The execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement and the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby will not (i) constitute a breach of any instrument or agreement governing any Company IP other than consents required for licenses, (ii) cause the forfeiture or termination or give rise to a right of forfeiture or termination of any Company IP or (iii) otherwise impair the right of Parent, the Surviving Entity or their Subsidiaries, following the Merger, to use or otherwise exploit, assert or enforce any Company IP. 

   

 (e) To the knowledge of the Company, no employee of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries has entered into any contract or agreement that restricts or limits in any way the scope or type of work in which the employee may be engaged or requires the employee to transfer, assign, or disclose information concerning such employees work to anyone other than the Company or its Subsidiaries.

    ##### 

  

    

effect of causing, the Company to abandon, terminate or fail to consummate
the Merger or any other transaction contemplated by this Agreement. Other
than with respect to Parent and Merger Sub, the Company shall not (i)
waive, modify, terminate, or fail to enforce any "standstill" obligation of
any Person, (ii) modify, waive, amend or terminate the Company Rights
Agreement, or (iii) render the restrictions on "Business Combinations" (as
defined in Section 203 of the DGCL) under Section 203 of the
DGCL inapplicable to any Person. Any violation of the foregoing restrictions
of this Section 5.3(a) by any of the Companys Subsidiaries or by any
Representative of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, whether or not such
Representative is so authorized and whether or not such Representative is
purporting to act on behalf of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
or otherwise, shall be deemed to be a breach of this Agreement by the
Company. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, the
Company and the Company Board may take any actions described in clause (ii)
of the first sentence of this Section 5.3(a) with respect to a third party at
any time prior to obtaining the Company Required Vote if, prior to such vote,
(w) the Company receives a bona fide written Acquisition Proposal from such
third party (and such Acquisition Proposal was not initiated, solicited,
encouraged or facilitated by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or any of
their respective Representatives in violation of this Agreement and did
not otherwise result from a violation of this Agreement or any standstill
agreement), (x) the Company Board determines in good faith by resolution duly
adopted (after consultation with financial advisors and outside legal counsel
of nationally recognized reputation) that such proposal constitutes or is
reasonably likely to result in a Superior Proposal from the third party that
made the applicable Acquisition Proposal, (y) the Company Board determines in
good faith by resolution duly adopted (after consultation with financial
advisors and outside legal counsel of nationally recognized reputation) that
the third party making such Acquisition Proposal has the financial and legal
capability and capacity to consummate such Acquisition Proposal and (z) the
Company Board determines after the receipt of advice from outside legal
counsel that the failure to take such action would be reasonably likely to
result in a breach of its fiduciary duties under applicable Law; provided
that the Company shall not deliver any information to such third party
without entering into an Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement, and the
Company shall promptly provide or make available to Parent any material non-
public information concerning the Company or any of its Subsidiaries that is
provided to any Person making such Acquisition Proposal or such Persons
Representatives that was not previously provided or made available to
Parent. 

   

 (b) The Company agrees that in addition to the obligations of the Company set forth in paragraph (a) of this Section 5.3, as promptly as practicable after receipt thereof (but in no event more than 48 hours after the Companys receipt thereof), the Company shall advise Parent orally and in writing in the event that the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or Representatives receives, directly or indirectly: (i) any Acquisition Proposal or indication by any Person that it is considering making an Acquisition Proposal or proposals or offers with respect to an Acquisition Proposal, (ii) any request for non-public information relating to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries other than a request for information in the ordinary course of business and unrelated to an Acquisition Proposal, or (iii) any inquiry or request for discussions or negotiations regarding any Acquisition Proposal or potential Acquisition Proposal. The Company shall promptly (and in any event within 48 hours) notify Parent orally and in writing of the identity of any such Person and provide to Parent a copy of any such Acquisition Proposal, inquiry or request (or, where no such copy is available, a written description of such Acquisition Proposal, inquiry or request), including any material modifications to any Acquisition Proposal. 

    ##### 

  

    

The Company shall keep Parent reasonably informed (orally and in writing) on
a prompt basis (and in any event within 48 hours) of the status and details
of any such Acquisition Proposal, indication, inquiry or request
(including the material terms and conditions thereof and of any modifications
thereto). Without limiting the foregoing, the Company shall promptly (and in
any event within 24 hours) notify Parent orally and in writing if it
determines to engage in any actions described in clause (ii) of Section 5.3(a)
and shall keep Parent reasonably informed (orally and in writing) on a prompt
basis (and in any event within 24 hours) of the status and details of any
such actions. In addition, the Company shall not, and shall cause its
Subsidiaries not to, enter into any confidentiality agreement with any Person
that would restrict the Companys ability to provide information to Parent as
required by Sections 5.3(b) or Section 5.3(c). 

   

 (c) Neither (i) the Company Board nor any committee thereof shall directly or indirectly (A) withdraw (or amend, qualify or modify in a manner adverse to Parent or Merger Sub), or propose to withdraw (or amend, qualify or modify in a manner adverse to Parent or Merger Sub), the approval, recommendation or declaration of advisability by the Company Board or any such committee thereof of this Agreement, the Merger or the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement or (B) recommend, adopt or approve, or propose publicly to recommend, adopt or approve, any Acquisition Proposal (any action described in this clause (i) being referred to as a " _Company Adverse Recommendation Change_ ") nor (ii) shall the Company or any of its Subsidiaries execute or enter into, any agreement, including any letter of intent, memorandum of understanding, agreement in principle, merger agreement, acquisition agreement, option agreement, joint venture agreement, partnership agreement or other similar agreement, arrangement or understanding, (A) constituting or related to, or that is intended to or could reasonably be expected to lead to, any Acquisition Proposal (other than an Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement permitted pursuant to Section 5.3(a)) (each an " _Acquisition Agreement_ ") or (B) requiring it to abandon, terminate or fail to consummate the Merger or any other transaction contemplated by this Agreement. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, at any time prior to obtaining the Company Required Vote, and subject to the Companys compliance at all times with the provisions of this Section 5.3 and Section 5.6, the Company Board may, in response to a Superior Proposal, make a Company Adverse Recommendation Change if the Company Board (i) determines in good faith, after consultation with outside legal counsel, that the failure to make a Company Adverse Recommendation Change would be reasonably likely to result in a breach of its fiduciary duties to the stockholders of the Company, and (ii) provides prior written notice to Parent (a " _Company Notice of Change_ ") advising Parent that the Company Board is contemplating making such Company Adverse Recommendation Change and specifying the material facts and information constituting the basis for such contemplated determination, including the terms and conditions of such Superior Proposal; _provided, however_ , that (x) the Company Board may not make such Company Adverse Recommendation Change until the fifth Business Day after receipt by Parent of the Company Notice of Change (it being understood and agreed that any changes to the financial terms or any other material term of such Superior Proposal shall require a new Company Adverse Recommendation, a new Company Notice of Change and a new five Business Day period) and (y) during such five Business Day period, at the request of Parent, the Company shall negotiate in good faith with respect to any changes or modifications to this Agreement which would allow the Company Board not to make such Company Adverse Recommendation Change consistent with its fiduciary duties. 

     ##### 

  

     

 (d) Nothing contained in Section 5.3(c) shall prohibit the Company or the Company Board from taking and disclosing to the Companys stockholders a position with respect to an Acquisition Proposal pursuant to Rules 14d-9 and 14e-2(a) promulgated under the Exchange Act or from making any similar disclosure, in either case to the extent required by applicable Law, _provided, however_ , that (i) compliance with such rules shall in no way limit or modify the effect that any such action pursuant to such rules has under this Agreement and (ii) in no event shall the Company Board or any committee thereof take any action prohibited by Section 5.3(a). 

   

 (e) For purposes of this Agreement, " _Acquisition Proposal_ " shall mean any proposal, whether or not in writing (other than by Parent or any of its Subsidiaries), for the (i) direct or indirect acquisition or purchase of a business or assets that generates or constitutes 15% or more of the net revenues, net income or the assets (based on the book or fair market value thereof) of the Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole (including capital stock of or ownership interest in any Subsidiary), (ii) direct or indirect acquisition or purchase of any equity securities or capital stock representing 15% or more of the ownership interest in the Company or any equity securities or capital stock of any of the Companys Subsidiaries that, individually or in the aggregate, represent a direct or indirect ownership interest in 15% or more of the consolidated assets of the Company, or (iii) merger, consolidation, restructuring, transfer of assets or other business combination, sale of shares of capital stock, tender offer, exchange offer, recapitalization, stock repurchase program or other similar transaction that if consummated would result in any Person or Persons beneficially owning equity securities or capital stock representing 15% or more of the ownership interest in the Company or equity securities or capital stock of any of the Companys Subsidiaries that, individually or in the aggregate, represent a direct or indirect ownership interest in 15% or more of the consolidated assets of the Company, in each case other than the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. The term " _Superior Proposal_ " shall mean any bona fide written Acquisition Proposal that was not initiated, solicited, encouraged or facilitated by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or any of its Representatives in violation of this Agreement, made by a third party to acquire, directly or indirectly, pursuant to a tender offer, exchange offer, merger, share exchange, asset purchase or other business combination, (A) all or substantially all of the assets of the Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, or (B) 100% of the equity securities of the Company, in each case on terms which the Company Board determines (after consultation with its financial advisors and outside legal counsel of nationally recognized reputation) in good faith by resolution duly adopted (1) would result in a transaction that, if consummated, is more favorable to the stockholders of the Company (in their capacity as stockholders) than the Merger, taking into account all the terms and conditions of such proposal, the Person making such proposal and this Agreement (including any break-up fees, expense reimbursement provisions, conditions to consummation and any changes to the terms of this Agreement offered by Parent in response to such Superior Proposal or otherwise pursuant to this Section 5.3) and (2) is reasonably likely to be completed on the terms proposed, taking into account all financial, regulatory, legal and other aspects of such proposal; _provided, however_ , that no proposal shall be deemed to be a Superior Proposal if such proposal is subject to a financing condition or any financing required to consummate the proposal is not committed (unless it is reasonable to conclude that the proposed acquiror has adequate financial resources to consummate the transaction). 

      ##### 

  

     

 (f) Immediately after the execution and delivery of this Agreement, the Company shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries and Representatives to, cease and terminate any existing activities, discussions or negotiations with any Person conducted heretofore with respect to any possible Acquisition Proposal. The Company agrees that it shall (i) take the necessary steps to promptly inform its Representatives involved in the transactions contemplated by this Agreement of the obligations undertaken in this Section 5.3 and (ii) within five Business Days following the execution of this Agreement, request each Person (other than Parent and any of its Subsidiaries) who has heretofore executed a confidentiality agreement within the last two years in connection with such Persons consideration of any Acquisition Proposal, or any similar transaction to return or destroy (which destruction shall be certified in writing by an executive officer of such Person) all confidential information heretofore furnished to such Person by or on its behalf. 

   

 5.4 _Access to Information and Properties_. 

  

 (a) Upon reasonable notice and subject to the Confidentiality Agreement (defined below) and applicable Laws relating to the exchange of information, the Company shall, and shall cause each of its Subsidiaries to, afford to the authorized Representatives of Parent reasonable access during normal business hours during the period prior to the Effective Time, to all of its properties, offices, contracts, books, commitments, records, data and personnel and, during such period, it shall, and shall cause each of its Subsidiaries to, make available to the Representatives of Parent all information concerning its business, properties and personnel as Parent may reasonably request. Without limiting the foregoing, the Company shall cooperate and provide the authorized Representatives of Parent with all relevant information reasonably required by Parent or any of such Representatives for the purpose of determining that the business conducted by the Company and its Subsidiaries complies with, and does not raise material liability risks under, applicable Laws, including, without limitation, the FCPA and other applicable anti-corruption Laws. In connection with due diligence that Parent and its counsel will conduct with respect to compliance under such Laws, the Company and its Subsidiaries agree to cooperate fully with all reasonable aspects of Parents due diligence process. In this context, cooperation includes making available to the authorized Representatives of Parent all policies, procedures, guidelines, training materials, due diligence files, internal and external audits, investigative reports, hotline records and other information and materials that Parent reasonably requests relevant to compliance with, or otherwise related to, such Laws. The Company and its Subsidiaries will make reasonably available their personnel, including senior management and personnel responsible for compliance, internal audit, finance, investigations, logistics, sales and marketing and other areas Parent reasonably considers to be relevant to overall corporate compliance. The Company understands and agrees that the matters discussed in this Section 5.4(a) may extend to and include on-site interviews and visits to the Companys and its Subsidiaries overseas locations and that the determination of the site of any such interviews and visits shall be at the sole decision of Parent acting reasonably. The cooperation provisions of this Section 5.4(a) extend fully to all of the Companys and its Subsidiaries overseas business, joint venture and subsidiary locations. In addition, the Company agrees to use its reasonable best efforts to facilitate meetings with joint venture partners, agents, Representatives, consultants, customs brokers and other third parties that Parent or its counsel determines may be relevant to due diligence. The Company shall have the right, in its sole discretion to have a Company representative present for investigations, interviews and visits. 

     ##### 

  

    

Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this Section 5.4(a), neither the
Company nor any of its Subsidiaries shall be required to provide access to or
to disclose information where such access or disclosure would violate or
prejudice the rights of its customers, jeopardize any attorney-client
privilege or contravene any Law or binding agreement entered into prior to
the date of this Agreement; _provided, however_ , that the Company shall use
its reasonable best efforts to provide such access or information in a manner
that avoids or removes the impediments described in this sentence. The
Company will use its reasonable best efforts to make appropriate substitute
disclosure arrangements under circumstances in which the restrictions of
the preceding sentence apply. 

   

 (b) Following the execution and delivery of this Agreement, Parent will continue to conduct due diligence with respect to the compliance by the Company with the FCPA, and the Company hereby agrees to fully cooperate with such efforts. If Parent concludes that there is a possible violation of the FCPA by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, the existence or occurrence of which has not been previously disclosed to the applicable Governmental Entity, Parent will so inform the Company, and the Company will use its reasonable best efforts to resolve each such violation and any issues related thereto, including by disclosing to the applicable Governmental Entity the existence or occurrence of any such violation if, with the advice of the Companys outside counsel, the Company concludes that such disclosure or resolution should be made. 

   

 (c) Parent and the Company will hold any information obtained or contemplated under Sections 5.4(a) and (b) above in accordance with the provisions of the confidentiality agreement between the Company and Halliburton Energy Services, Inc., dated as of January 7, 2009 (the " _Confidentiality Agreement_ "). 

   

 (d) No investigation by Parent or the Company or their respective Representatives made pursuant to this Section 5.4 shall affect the representations, warranties, covenants or agreements of the other set forth in this Agreement. 

   

 (e) Subject to compliance with applicable Law, from the date hereof until the Effective Time, each party shall confer on a regular and frequent basis with one or more Representatives of the other parties to report operational matters of materiality and the general status of ongoing operations. 

   

 5.5 _Further Action; Commercially Reasonable Efforts_. 

  

 (a) Upon the terms and subject to the conditions herein provided, and subject to Sections 5.3 and 5.6(d), each of the parties hereto agrees to use its commercially reasonable efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all action and to do, or cause to be done, all things necessary, proper or advisable under applicable Laws or otherwise to consummate and make effective the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including (i) to satisfy the conditions precedent to the obligations of any of the parties hereto, (ii) preparing and filing as promptly as practicable with any Governmental Entity or other third party all documentation to effect all necessary filings, notices, petitions, statements, registrations, submissions of information, applications and other documents and (iii) obtaining and maintaining all approvals, consents, registrations, permits, authorizations and other confirmations required to be obtained from any Governmental 

    ##### 

  

    

Entity or other third party that are necessary, proper or advisable to
consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Each of the
parties hereto will furnish to the other parties such necessary information
and reasonable assistance as such other parties may reasonably request
in connection with the foregoing and, subject to applicable Laws and any
applicable privilege relating to the exchange of information, will provide
the other parties with copies of all filings made by such party with any
Governmental Entity (except for filings available publicly on the SECs
EDGAR system) or any other information supplied by such party to or received
from a Governmental Entity in connection with this Agreement and the
transactions contemplated hereby; provided that neither party is obligated to
share any document submitted to or received from a Governmental Entity
that reflects the negotiations between the parties or the valuation of some
or all of any partys business. 

   

 (b) Each of Parent, Merger Sub and the Company shall use their respective commercially reasonable efforts and shall cooperate with the other parties to resolve such objections, if any, as may be asserted with respect to the transactions contemplated hereby under applicable Law. Without limiting the foregoing, the Company and Parent shall, as soon as practicable and in any event within seven Business Days after the date of this Agreement, file Notification and Report Forms under the HSR Act with the Federal Trade Commission (the " _FTC_ ") and the Antitrust Division of the Department of Justice (the " _Antitrust Division_ ") and shall use commercially reasonable efforts to respond as promptly as practicable to all inquiries received from the FTC or the Antitrust Division for additional information or documentation. 

   

 (c) Each of the parties hereto shall use commercially reasonable efforts to prevent the entry of, and to cause to be discharged or vacated, any order or injunction of a Governmental Entity precluding, restraining, enjoining or prohibiting consummation of the Merger; _provided_ , _however_ , that no party hereto shall be required to dispose of any assets or limit its freedom of action with respect to any of its businesses, or to consent or commit to consent to such disposition or limit on its freedom of action, which, in the reasonable good faith judgment of Parent, could be reasonably likely to (i) give rise to a Material Adverse Effect or (ii) materially impair the benefits or advantages that Parent expects to receive from the Merger and the transactions contemplated thereby. 

   

 (d) Each of Parent and the Company shall give the other reasonable opportunity to participate in the defense of (i) any inquiry by a Governmental Entity and (ii) litigation against Parent or the Company, as applicable, and its directors relating to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. 

   

 (e) The Company will provide Parent advance notice and the opportunity to participate in any discussions with any U.S. government agency such as the SEC or the Department of Justice, the Department of Commerce or other government bodies with enforcement authority (collectively, the " _USG Authorities_ "); and with respect to any discussions by the Company with the USG Authorities where the Parent has agreed not to participate, Company will in all such cases provide Parent with a comprehensive review of all discussions held with the USG Authorities regarding compliance issues or potential compliance issues whether they be ones previously disclosed to the USG Authorities or new issues. Prior to the Effective Time, Parent and the Company shall jointly consider in good faith whether and, if so, how to disclose or attempt to resolve any issues with the USG Authorities. 

     ##### 

 

  

 5.6  _Proxy Statement; Registration Statement; Company Stockholder Meeting._  

   

 (a) As promptly as practicable after the execution of this Agreement, the Company and Parent shall cooperate in preparing the Proxy Statement and the Registration Statement, and the Company shall file the Proxy Statement in preliminary form with the SEC and Parent shall file the Registration Statement, in which the Proxy Statement will be included as a prospectus, with the SEC, and the parties shall file, if necessary, any other statement or schedule relating to this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby. Each of the Company, Parent and Merger Sub shall use their respective reasonable best efforts to furnish the information required to be included by the SEC in the Proxy Statement, the Registration Statement and any such statement or schedule. Parent shall use its reasonable best efforts to have the Registration Statement declared effective under the Securities Act as promptly as practicable after such filling, and the Company shall as promptly as practicable thereafter mail the Proxy Statement to its stockholders. 

   

 (b) If at any time prior to the Effective Time, any event or circumstance relating to the Company, Parent, Merger Sub or any of their respective affiliates, or its or their respective officers or directors, should be discovered by the Company, Parent or Merger Sub that should be set forth in an amendment to the Registration Statement or a supplement to the Proxy Statement so that any of such documents, including documents and financial statements incorporated by reference therein, would not include any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, the Company, Parent or Merger Sub shall promptly inform the other parties hereto in writing. All documents that the Company or Parent is responsible for filing with the SEC in connection with the transactions contemplated herein will comply as to form in all material respects with applicable requirements of the Securities Act and the Exchange Act. The parties shall promptly notify each other, as applicable, of the time when the Registration Statement has become effective, of the issuance of any stop order or suspension of the qualification of the Parent Common Stock issuable in connection with the Merger for offering or sale in any jurisdiction, or of the receipt of any comments from the staff of the SEC and of any request by the staff of the SEC for amendments or supplements to the Proxy Statement or the Registration Statement or for additional information and shall supply each other with copies of (i) all correspondence between it or any of its Representatives, on the one hand, and the staff of the SEC, on the other hand, with respect to the Proxy Statement, the Registration Statement or the Merger and (ii) all orders of the SEC relating to the Registration Statement. No filing of, or amendment or supplement to, the Registration Statement will be made by Parent, and no filing of, or amendment or supplement to the Proxy Statement will be made by the Company or Parent, in each case, without providing the other party and its respective counsel the reasonable opportunity to review and comment thereon and giving due consideration to such comments. 

   

 (c) The Company, acting through the Company Board, shall, in accordance with its certificate of incorporation and bylaws and with applicable Law, promptly and duly call, give notice of, convene and hold, as soon as practicable following the date upon which the Registration Statement becomes effective, an annual or special meeting of its stockholders for the sole purpose of considering and taking action upon this Agreement and, in the case of an annual meeting of stockholders, for such other purposes as may be appropriate for an annual 

   ##### 

  

   

meeting of stockholders (such meeting, including any postponement or
adjournment thereof, the " _Company Stockholder Meeting_ "); _provided,
however_ , that the use of an annual meeting of the Companys stockholders
rather than a special meeting shall not materially delay the holding of the
Company Stockholder Meeting. Except as otherwise provided in Section 5.3(c),
the Company, acting through the Company Board, shall (i) recommend adoption
of this Agreement and include in the Proxy Statement such recommendation and
(ii) use its reasonable best efforts to solicit and obtain such adoption.
Notwithstanding any Company Adverse Recommendation Change or the commencement,
public proposal, public disclosure or communication to the Company of any
Acquisition Proposal, or any other fact or circumstance (except for
termination of this Agreement pursuant to Section 7.1), this Agreement shall
be submitted to the stockholders of the Company at the Company Stockholder
Meeting for the purpose of adopting this Agreement, with such disclosures as
shall be required by applicable Law. In circumstances in which the Company
may terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 7.1(d) but elects not to do
so, at any such Company Stockholder Meeting following any Company Adverse
Recommendation Change, the Company may submit this Agreement to its
stockholders without a recommendation or with a negative recommendation
(although the approval of this Agreement by the Company Board may not be
rescinded or amended), in which event the Company Board may communicate the
basis for its lack of a recommendation or negative recommendation to
its stockholders in the Proxy Statement or an appropriate amendment or
supplement thereto. The Company shall provide Parent with the Companys
stockholder list as and when requested by Parent, including at any time and
from time to time following a Company Adverse Recommendation Change. 

   

 (d) Promptly following the execution and delivery of this Agreement, Parent, as the owner of all of the outstanding membership interests in Merger Sub, will adopt this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby in its capacity as sole member of Merger Sub.

 5.8 _Directors  and Officers Insurance and Indemnification._ 

   

 (a) The certificate of formation and limited liability company agreement of the Surviving Entity and each of its Subsidiaries shall, for a period of six years after the Effective Time, contain provisions no less favorable to the Persons covered thereby with respect to exculpation, indemnification and advancement of expenses than are set forth in the certificate of incorporation and bylaws of the Company and the organizational documents of the Company Subsidiaries, respectively, as of the date of this Agreement. 

   

 (b) The Surviving Entity shall, for six years after the Effective Time, maintain in effect the current directors and officers liability insurance policies maintained by the Company ( _provided_  that the Surviving Entity may substitute therefor policies of at least the same 

   ##### 

  

   

coverage and amounts containing terms and conditions which are no less
advantageous to such officers and directors so long as substitution does not
result in gaps or lapses in coverage) with respect to matters occurring prior
to the Effective Time; _provided, however_ , that in no event shall
the Surviving Entity be required to expend pursuant to this Section 5.8(b)
more than an amount per year equal to 200% of current annual premiums paid by
the Company for such insurance and, in the event the cost of such coverage
shall exceed that amount, the Surviving Entity shall purchase as
much coverage as possible for such amount. The provisions of this Section 5.8
shall be deemed to have been satisfied if prepaid "tail" policies have been
obtained by the Surviving Entity for purposes of this Section 5.8 from
carriers with the same or better rating as the carrier of such insurances as
of the date of this Agreement. 

   

 (c) In the event the Surviving Entity or any of its successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any other Person and shall not be the continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers all or substantially all of its properties and assets to any Person, then, and in each such case, proper provision shall be made so that the successors and assigns of the Surviving Entity or the purchaser of its assets and properties shall assume the obligations set forth in this Section 5.8. 

   

 5.9 _Publicity._  None of the Company, Parent or Merger Sub, or any of their respective affiliates, shall issue or cause the publication of any press release or other announcement or hold any press conferences, analyst calls or other meetings with respect to the Merger, this Agreement or the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement without the prior consultation of the other party (including giving the other party a reasonable opportunity to review and comment on such publication or the subject matter of such conferences, calls or meetings), except as may be required by Law or by any listing agreement with, or regulation of, any securities exchange or regulatory authority if all reasonable best efforts have been made to consult with the other party. In addition, the Company shall in a like manner and to the extent reasonably practicable consult with Parent regarding the form and content of any public disclosure of any material developments or matters involving the Company, including earnings releases, reasonably in advance of publication or release. 

  

 5.10 _Stock Exchange Listing._  Parent shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause the Parent Common Stock to be issued in connection with the Merger to be listed on the NYSE, subject to official notice of issuance as of the Effective Time. 

  

 5.11 _Employee Benefits._  

  

 (a) Parent and the Company agree that all employees of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be employed by the Surviving Entity or its Subsidiaries immediately after the Effective Time (" _Continuing Employees_ "), it being understood that none of Parent, the Surviving Entity or any of their Subsidiaries shall have any obligation to continue employing the Continuing Employees for any length of time thereafter, except pursuant to any agreement referenced in Section 3.14(q). 

   

 (b) Parent shall deem, and shall cause the Surviving Entity and Parents other Subsidiaries to deem, Prior Service (as defined below) to have been employment and service with Parent, the Surviving Entity or applicable Subsidiary for benefit plan eligibility and vesting 

   ##### 

  

   

purposes, but not benefit accrual except with respect to vacation, short-term
disability and severance pay, for such employee benefit plans, programs,
policies or arrangements maintained by Parent or a Subsidiary of Parent
primarily for the benefit of employees in the United States for which
the Continuing Employees are eligible to the extent service with Parent, the
Surviving Entity or applicable Subsidiary is recognized under any such plan,
program, policy or arrangement. For purposes of this Section 5.11(b), "
_Prior Service_ " shall mean (i) the period of employment with the Company
and any of its Subsidiaries (and with predecessor employers with respect to
which the Company or its Subsidiaries shall have granted service credit), and
(ii) the period of uninterrupted employment with Parent, any Subsidiary of
Parent and any predecessor of any such entity if such employment ended
immediately prior to employment by the Company or a Subsidiary. 

   

 (c) Parent shall cause the Surviving Entity to continue to maintain the Company Medical and Dental Plan as well as the life, ADandD, short-term disability, long-term disability, flexible spending account and other welfare benefit plans (the " _Company Welfare Plans_ ") until December 31, 2010 in such form as in effect as of the date of this Agreement. Each Continuing Employee who continues as an employee of the Surviving Entity shall be eligible to continue to participate in the Company Welfare Plans in the same manner and to the same extent as such Continuing Employee participated immediately prior to the Effective Time until December 31, 2010. Under any medical and dental plans covering any Continuing Employee based in the United States on January 1, 2011, Parent or the Surviving Entity shall ensure that no waiting periods, exclusions or limitations with respect to any pre-existing conditions, evidence of insurability or good health or actively-at-work exclusions apply to the Continuing Employee or his dependents or beneficiaries for the plan year beginning January 1, 2011. 

   

 (d) Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing contained herein, whether express or implied, shall be treated as an amendment or other modification of any Company Employee Benefit Plan or other employee benefit plan or arrangement, or shall limit the right of Parent, the Surviving Entity, the Company or any of their Subsidiaries, to amend, terminate or otherwise modify any such Company Employee Benefit Plan or other employee benefit plan or arrangement following the Closing Date. In the event that (i) a party other than the Parent, the Company or any of their Subsidiaries makes a claim or takes other action to enforce any provision in this Agreement as an amendment to any Company Employee Benefit Plan or other employee benefit plan or arrangement, and (ii) such provision is deemed to be an amendment to such Company Employee Benefit Plan or other employee benefit plan or arrangement even though not explicitly designated as such in this Agreement, then such provision shall lapse retroactively and shall have no amendatory effect. 

   

 (e) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall take or cause its Subsidiary that sponsors the 401(k) plan maintained for employees of the Company and its Subsidiaries (the " _Company 401(k) Plan_ ") to take such action as is necessary to (i) adopt amendments to the Company 401(k) Plan required to be adopted in accordance with the Code to reflect qualification requirements that apply as of the date of termination of the Company 401(k) Plan, (ii) take all necessary action to terminate the Company 401(k) Plan, and (iii) ensure that each Company employee is fully vested in his or her account balance under the Company 401(k) Plan. Following the Effective Time, to the extent provided under the terms of the Company 401(k) 

   ##### 

  

    

     Plan at the time of termination, Parent shall permit participants in
the Company 401(k) Plan who are employed by Parent or its Subsidiaries to (i)
make in-service withdrawals from the Company 401(k) Plan, and (ii) continue to
receive and repay any loans from the Company 401(k) Plan. Following the
Effective Time, Parent shall permit each participant in the Company 401(k)
Plan who terminates employment with the Surviving Entity or its Subsidiaries
the right to receive a distribution of such participants interest under
the Company 401(k) Plan. As soon as practicable following IRS approval of the
termination of the Company 401(k) Plan, Parent or the Surviving Entity shall,
with respect to Continuing Employees who remain actively employed with Parent
or the Surviving Entity (i) provide an election to roll over their interest
under the Company 401(k) Plan, including plan loans, to a tax-qualified
defined contribution plan maintained by Parent or an affiliate of Parent (a "
_Parent DC Plan_ "), (ii) cause the trustee of the Company 401(k) Plan to
roll over the interest which the participant elects to roll over to the
Parent DC Plan, and (iii) cause the Parent DC Plan to accept any such
rollovers. The Continuing Employees shall be eligible to participate in
Parents or a Subsidiarys 401(k) plan immediately following the Effective
Time.

 (a) Parent and the Company shall each use its reasonable best efforts to cause the Merger to qualify as a "reorganization" within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code, to not take any action reasonably likely to cause the Merger not to so qualify and to obtain the Tax opinions set forth in Sections 6.2(c) and 6.3(d). 

   

 (b) Officers of Parent, Merger Sub and the Company shall execute and deliver to Thompson and Knight LLP, in its capacity as Tax counsel for the Company, and Baker Botts L.L.P., in its capacity as Tax counsel for Parent, certificates substantially in the form agreed to by the parties and such firms at such time or times as may reasonably be requested by such firms, including contemporaneously with the execution of this Agreement, at the time the Registration Statement is declared effective by the SEC and the Effective Time, in connection with such Tax counsels respective delivery of opinions pursuant to Sections 6.2(c) and 6.3(d) hereof. Each of Parent, Merger Sub and the Company shall use its reasonable best efforts not to take or cause to be taken any action that would cause to be untrue (or fail to take or cause not to be taken any action which would cause to be untrue) any of the certifications and representations included in the certificates described in this Section 5.12(b). 

   

 (c) Between the date hereof and the Closing Date, the Company agrees to (i) prepare all Returns, other than income tax Returns, for any periods ending prior to the Closing Date and which are required to be filed within 15 days following such date (taking extensions to file into account) using Tax accounting methods and principles consistent with those used for preceding Tax periods, unless a change is required by applicable Law, and (ii) prepare and submit to Parent income Tax Returns, including quarterly income Tax estimates, where such Returns would be required to be filed on or before the Closing Date (taking extensions to file into account). The Company shall make such income Tax Returns available to Parent for review

any reasonable request by Parent with respect to such Returns. Such Returns
shall be prepared and filed, and all related Taxes paid, on or prior to
the Closing Date. 

   

 5.13 _Section 16 Matters._ Prior to the Closing Date, Parent and the Company, and their respective Boards of Directors, shall use their reasonable best efforts to take all actions to cause any dispositions of Company Common Stock (including derivative securities with respect to Company Common Stock) or acquisitions of Parent Common Stock (including derivative securities with respect to Parent Common Stock) resulting from the transactions contemplated hereby by each individual who is subject to the reporting requirements of Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act to be exempt from Section 16(b) of the Exchange Act under Rule 16b-3 promulgated under the Exchange Act. 

  

 5.14 _No Takeover Statute Applies._  The Company shall take all actions necessary to be taken such that no restrictive provision of any "moratorium," "control share acquisition," "fair price," "interested shareholder," "affiliate transaction," "business combination," or other similar anti-takeover statutes or Laws, including the State of Delaware and Section 203 of the DGCL, or any applicable anti-takeover provision in the certificate of incorporation or bylaws of the Company, is, or at the Effective Time will be, applicable to the Company, Parent, Merger Sub, Company Common Stock, this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby.

Each party acknowledges that the agreements contained in Section 5.3 and this Section 8.1 are an integral part of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and that, without these agreements, the other party would not enter into this Agreement; accordingly, if either party fails promptly to pay or cause to be paid the amounts due from it pursuant to such sections, and, in order to obtain such payment, the other party commences a suit that results in a judgment for the amounts set forth in such sections, the defaulting party shall pay to the other party its reasonable costs and expenses (including attorneys fees and expenses) in connection with such suit and any appeal relating thereto, together with interest on the amounts set forth in this Section 8.1 from the date payment was due at 8% per annum. 

   

 (f) For purposes of Sections 8.1(d) and 8.1(e), the term " _Acquisition Proposal_ " shall have the meaning assigned to such term in Section 5.3(e), except that all references to "15%" therein shall be deemed to be references to "50%." 

   

 (g) This Section 8.1 shall survive any termination of this Agreement. In no event shall Parent be entitled to receive under this _Article VIII_ more than an aggregate amount equal to the Company Termination Fee. 

   

 8.2 _Amendment; Waiver._  

  

 (a) This Agreement may be amended by the parties to this Agreement, by action taken or authorized by their respective boards of directors, at any time before or after approval by the stockholders of the Company of the matters presented in connection with the Merger, but after any such approval no amendment shall be made without the approval of the stockholders of the Company if such amendment requires such approval under applicable Law or 

   ##### 

  

   

stock exchange rules without further approval of such stockholders. This
Agreement may not be amended except by an instrument in writing signed on
behalf of each of the parties hereto. 

   

 (b) At any time prior to the Effective Time, the Company, on one hand, and Parent and Merger Sub, on the other hand, may (i) extend the time for the performance of any of the obligations or other acts of the other parties hereto, (ii) waive in whole or in part any inaccuracies in the representations and warranties of the other parties contained herein or in any document, certificate or writing delivered pursuant hereto by the other party or (iii) subject to Section 8.2(a), waive in whole or in part compliance with any of the agreements or conditions of the other parties hereto contained herein. Any agreement on the part of any party to any such extension or waiver shall be valid only if set forth in an instrument in writing signed on behalf of such party. Any such waiver shall constitute a waiver only with respect to the specific matter described in such writing and shall in no way impair the rights of the party granting such waiver in any other respect or at any other time. Neither the waiver by any of the parties hereto of a breach of or a default under any of the provisions of this Agreement, nor the failure by any of the parties, on one or more occasions, to enforce any of the provisions of this Agreement or to exercise any right or privilege hereunder, shall be construed as a waiver of any other breach or default of a similar nature, or as a waiver of any of such provisions, rights or privileges hereunder. The rights and remedies herein provided are cumulative and none is exclusive of any other, or of any rights or remedies that any party may otherwise have at law or in equity. 

   

 8.3 _Survival._  The representations and warranties contained in this Agreement or in any certificates or other documents delivered prior to or as of the Effective Time shall survive until (but not beyond) the Effective Time. The covenants and agreements of the parties hereto (including the Surviving Entity after the Merger) shall survive the Effective Time without limitation (except for those which, by their terms, contemplate a shorter survival period), and the covenants and agreements contained in this Article VIII and Sections 5.9 and 7.2 shall survive the termination of this Agreement. 

  

 8.4 _Notices._  Except for notices that are specifically required by the terms of this Agreement to be delivered orally, all notices and other communications hereunder shall be in writing and shall be deemed given upon (a) transmitters confirmation of a receipt of a facsimile transmission, (b) confirmed delivery by a standard overnight carrier or when delivered by hand, (c) the expiration of five Business Days after the day when mailed in the United States by certified or registered mail, postage prepaid, or (d) delivery in Person, in each case addressed to the following addresses (or at such other address for a party as shall be specified by like notice):

 8.12 _Parties in Interest._  This Agreement shall be binding upon and inure solely to the benefit of each party to this Agreement and their permitted assignees, and nothing in this Agreement, express or implied, is intended to or shall confer upon any other Person any rights, benefits or remedies of any nature whatsoever under or by reason of this Agreement, other than Section 5.8. Without limiting the foregoing, no direct or indirect holder of any equity interests or securities of any party to this Agreement (whether such holder is a limited or general partner, member, stockholder or otherwise), nor any affiliate of any party to this Agreement, nor any Representative or other controlling Person of each of the parties to this Agreement and their respective affiliates shall have any liability or obligation arising under this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby.

 8.13 _Specific Performance._  The parties to this Agreement agree that irreparable damage would occur in the event that any provision of this Agreement was not performed in accordance with the terms of this Agreement and that the parties shall be entitled to specific performance of the terms of this Agreement in addition to any other remedy at law or equity. The parties accordingly agree that the parties will be entitled to an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions of this Agreement in the Chancery Court of the State of Delaware, this being in addition to any other remedy to which they are entitled at law or in equity or under this Agreement. 

   ##### 

  

  

 8.14 _Jurisdiction._  Each of the parties hereto agrees that any claim, suit, action or proceeding seeking to enforce any provision of, or based on any matter arising out of, under or in connection with, this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby shall be heard and determined in the Chancery Court of the State of Delaware (and each agrees that no such claim, suit, action or proceeding relating to this Agreement shall be brought by it or any of its affiliates except in such court), and the parties hereto hereby irrevocably and unconditionally submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of such court in any such claim, suit, action or proceeding and irrevocably and unconditionally waive the defense of an inconvenient forum to the maintenance of any such claim, suit, action or proceeding; _provided, however_ , that if the Chancery Court of the State of Delaware declines to accept jurisdiction over a particular matter, any state or federal court within the State of Delaware shall be deemed sufficient for purposes of this Section 8.14. Each of the parties hereto further agree that, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable Law, service of any process, summons, notice or document in any such claim, suit, action or proceeding may be served on any party anywhere in the world, whether within or without the jurisdiction of any such court. Without limiting the foregoing, each party agrees that service of process on such party as provided in Section 8.4 shall be deemed effective service of process on such party. The parties hereto hereby agree that a final, non-appealable judgment in any such claim, suit, action or proceeding shall be conclusive and may be enforced in other jurisdictions in the world by suit on the judgment or in any other manner provided by applicable Law.
