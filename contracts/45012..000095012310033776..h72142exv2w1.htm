includes making available to the authorized Representatives of Parent all policies, procedures,

responsible for compliance, internal audit, finance, investigations, logistics, sales and marketing
and other areas Parent reasonably considers to be relevant to overall corporate compliance. The
Company understands and agrees that the matters discussed in this Section&nbsp;5.4(a) may extend to and

In addition, the Company agrees to use its reasonable best efforts to facilitate meetings with
joint venture partners, agents, Representatives, consultants, customs brokers and other third
parties that Parent or its counsel determines may be relevant to due diligence. The Company shall
have the right, in its sole discretion to have a Company representative present for investigations,
interviews and visits.
