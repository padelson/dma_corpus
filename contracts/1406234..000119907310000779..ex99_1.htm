PRIME INFRASTRUCTURE AND BROOKFIELD INFRASTRUCTURE STRIKE MERGER AGREEMENT

  


 

  

Transaction will create a leading global infrastructure company with a market
capitalization in excess of US$2.5 billion; Prime security holders to receive
0.24 Units of Brookfield Infrastructure, representing a price of AUD$4.60 per
Prime Security, a premium of approximately 30% over the closing prices on 20
August 20101.

  


 

  

  

August 23, 2010 (East Australia Time) - Prime Infrastructure (ASX: PIH) and
Brookfield Infrastructure Partners L.P. (NYSE: BIP; TSX: BIP.UN) today
announced that they have entered into a definitive merger agreement to create
a leading global infrastructure company, in a transaction with an implied
value of AUD$1.6 billion (US$1.4 billion) for Prime Infrastructure.

  

  

Under the terms of the transaction, Prime security holders will receive 0.24
Brookfield Infrastructure units ("BIP Units") for each Prime stapled security
held, representing a price of AUD$4.60 per Prime Security. The transaction
represents a premium of approximately 28% and 32% if calculated based on the
five-trading day and 30-trading day, respectively, volume weighted average
prices of the Prime and BIP securities prior to the date of this
announcement2.

  

  

In addition, to accommodate holders of smaller numbers of Prime securities,
each Prime security holder is also entitled to receive cash in lieu of BIP
Units, up to a limit of 4,000 BIP Units per holder. As described in greater
detail below, based on analysis of the current Prime register, this liquidity
facility is expected to enable the vast majority of holders of smaller numbers
of Prime securities to receive a cash exit price of AUD$4.55 per unit3 for
their entire holding, if they so elect. In addition, Prime security holders
will be entitled to a distribution of 7.5 cents per security in respect of the
quarter ended 30 September 2010.

  

  

Upon successful completion of the transaction, Brookfield Infrastructure will
increase its ownership of Prime from 40% to 100%.

amount of $17.02 per BIP Unit (being the most recent 5 trading day volume
weighted average price for BIP Units on the New York Stock Exchange). This
equates to a price per Prime security of AUD$4.55 at the five-day average
exchange rate over the same period.

Merits of the Transaction

  

  

"We believe that this merger provides significant benefits to investors of
both Prime and Brookfield Infrastructure," said Sam Pollock, chief executive
officer of Brookfield Infrastructure Partners. Pollock added: "Over the past
several months, we have heard from a number of large Prime investors
encouraging us to undertake a merger transaction of this nature, and we are
pleased to bring this opportunity to all Prime security holders."

  

  

In unanimously agreeing to propose the transaction, the board of directors of
Brookfield Infrastructure noted that the transaction is expected to realize
the following key benefits to Brookfield Infrastructure:

  

  

    

  |  

-

  |  

accretive immediately to all holders of Brookfield Infrastructure;

   
---|---|---

---|---|--- 
 

  

  

    

  |  

-

  |  

greatly simplifies the ownership structure of the two businesses.

   
---|---|--- 
 

  

  

The Independent Directors of Prime have unanimously recommended the
transaction in the absence of a superior proposal, and subject to the required
independent expert report determining that the transaction is in the best
interests of Prime security holders. Grant Samuel has been engaged to prepare
the independent expert's report.

  

  

"Joining forces with established partners at Brookfield Infrastructure enables
us to continue to participate in the returns from our current investments,
within a larger, more diversified portfolio of high quality infrastructure
assets," said Hon. Dr. David Hamill, Independent Chairman of the Board of
Directors of Prime Infrastructure. "The Independent Directors believe that a
combination of these platforms offers Prime security holders an opportunity to
invest in a stronger global group with access to greater financing options and
significant growth prospects. In addition, the transaction if successful will
allow Prime security holders to achieve a significant value enhancement to
their investment in Prime Infrastructure, through the receipt of either
Brookfield Infrastructure units or cash."

  

  

The execution of the merger agreement was unanimously approved by Prime's
board of directors after receiving the unanimous recommendation of a
Transaction Committee comprised of all of Prime's Independent Directors,
including The Hon. Dr David Hamill (who served as Chairman of the Committee),
Mr. Leigh Hall, Mr. James Sloman and Mr. Barry Upson. The Transaction
Committee received independent financial advice from Gresham Advisory Partners
and legal advice from Freehills.

fact that the Brookfield Infrastructure offer:

platforms and the sponsorship of Brookfield Infrastructure.

Distributions

  

  

Upon successfully completing the acquisition of 100% of Prime, Brookfield
Infrastructure plans to increase its target annual distribution in calendar
2011 to US$1.24 per Unit (an increase of 13%), subject to board approval,
based on business conditions at that time. Based on the current exchange rate4
and the exchange ratio of 0.24, this would translate to an equivalent annual
distribution to Prime security holders who receive BIP Units of AUD$0.33 an
effective 10% increase in the current annualised quarterly distribution per
Prime security. The planned increase in Brookfield Infrastructure's
distribution reflects the anticipated strong cash flow generation of the
merged company and its superior portfolio of infrastructure assets. Due to the
merged enterprise's increased opportunity to invest in accretive growth
projects, this estimated distribution level has been set at a payout ratio at
or below the low end of Brookfield Infrastructure's targeted payout ratio of
60% to 70% of funds from operations.

  

  

The Board of Prime has resolved to pay a distribution of 7.5 cents5 per
security in respect of the quarter ending 30 September 2010. The Record Date
for this distribution will be 30 September 2010 and the distribution will be
paid on or about 30 November 2010.

  

  

Summary of the Transaction

  

  

The transaction is being implemented by way of a Scheme of Arrangement
(Scheme) under Australian law6. Brookfield Infrastructure will also make a
concurrent takeover bid (Bid) for Prime under Australian law.

  

  

Scheme of Arrangement

  

  

Under the Scheme, each Prime security holder will receive 0.24 BIP Units in
exchange for each Prime security held, subject to receipt of all applicable
approvals and consents. The Scheme requires approval by at least 75 per cent
of votes cast by Prime security holders (other than Brookfield Infrastructure)
and support from the majority by number of such holders who vote7. Prime plans
to hold security holders' meetings to approve the Scheme in early November
2010, pending receipt of applicable regulatory approvals and satisfaction of
other conditions.

  

  

 

In order to accommodate holders of smaller numbers of Prime securities,
Brookfield Infrastructure will make available a liquidity facility pursuant to
which each Prime security holder is entitled to receive cash in lieu of BIP
Units, up to a limit of 4,000 units per holder (Voluntary Liquidity Facility).
In addition, a separate liquidity facility will be implemented for all
ineligible

  


   

  

  

 

4. US$0.8939 per AUD

  

5. AUD$0.075 cents per security

  

6. A scheme of arrangement under section 411 of the Australian Corporations Act and concurrent 'trust schemes' effected by

  

constitutional changes and approvals under section 611, item 7 of the
Australian Corporations Act.

  

7. Subject to an ability of the Court to dispense with the majority by number requirement in some circumstances.

 

  

 

 

 

  

 

\- 3 -  

  

 

 

 

   
 

Prime security holders in jurisdictions where it may be impracticable to issue
BIP Units (Compulsory Liquidity Facility). Details of these liquidity
facilities are provided below.

  

  

Takeover Bid

  

  

Brookfield Infrastructure also intends to make an 'any or all' takeover offer
for Prime securities, for the same consideration as proposed under the Scheme,
other than that, due to securities law restrictions, the Voluntary Liquidity
Facility will not be made available under the Bid and the nature of the
Compulsory Facility will require regulatory approval, the receipt of which is
a condition of the Bid. The Bid will also be subject to the Scheme not
proceeding, and other conditions substantially similar to those applicable to
the Scheme which are described in the attached summary of the merger
agreement.

  

  

The Bid will not be subject to any minimum acceptance threshold, and
Brookfield Infrastructure will take up all Prime securities that are tendered,
subject to satisfaction or waiver of the conditions to the Bid. Brookfield
Infrastructure has decided to undertake the concurrent Bid in order to ensure
that Prime security holders are able to obtain the stock consideration offered
under this transaction, regardless of the outcome of the Scheme.

  

  

The Liquidity Facilities

  

  

Under the Scheme, Prime security holders may elect to receive cash by
accessing a Voluntary Liquidity Facility for up to 4,000 BIP Units that would
otherwise be received under the transaction. Under this Voluntary Liquidity
Facility, subject to the requirement to effect market sales as described
below, each electing holder will receive (subject to the limitation described
below) US$17.02 for each eligible Unit, representing the five-day volume-
weighted average trading price of BIP Units on the New York Stock Exchange
immediately preceding the date of this announcement. This equates to a price
per Prime security of AUD$4.55, based on the most recent five-day average
exchange rate over the same period

  

  

In addition, as is customary in transactions of this nature, under the Scheme,
a Compulsory Sale Facility will be established to enable the payment of cash
to Prime security holders who are ineligible to receive BIP Units under the
transaction. Under this facility, ineligible holders are expected to receive
(subject to the requirement to effect market sales described below) a price
for their Prime securities based on a 20-day volume weighted average trading
price ending on or about the completion of the transaction.

  

  

In order to support these facilities, Brookfield Asset Management has provided
an equity commitment of up to US$300 million. Since cash available under this
commitment is limited, the possibility exists that market sales under each of
the above facilities may be required. Accordingly, the ultimate price to be
paid to participants under the Voluntary Liquidity Facility or the Compulsory
Liquidity Facility cannot be assured. In the event that cash proceeds are
insufficient, excess units will be sold on the market and participants in the
applicable facility will receive the blended price. Based on analysis of the
current Prime register, however, it is reasonably likely that the amount of
these facilities combined will not exceed Brookfield Asset Management's US$300
million commitment, providing greater pricing certainty to participants in
these facilities.

 Commitment from Brookfield Asset Management

  

  

As described above, in order to support the liquidity facilities, Brookfield
Asset Management has provided an equity commitment of up to US$300 million.
Brookfield Infrastructure will draw amounts under this commitment first to
fund amounts required under the Voluntary Liquidity Facility, and second to
fund amounts required under the Compulsory Liquidity Facility (to the extent
of any then undrawn amounts under the commitment). Under this commitment,
Brookfield Asset Management will subscribe for equity at a price per unit of
US$17.02, being the same price to be paid to holders who elect to receive cash
under the Voluntary Liquidity Facility, except that the first US$50 million to
fund the Compulsory Facility will be subscribed at a price per unit based on
the same 20-day volume-weighted average trading price received by holders
under the Compulsory Liquidity Facility. These subscriptions may be for units
of either Brookfield Infrastructure or Brookfield Infrastructure L.P.

  

  

Following successful completion of the transaction, Brookfield Asset
Management is expected to hold between 28% and 39% of Brookfield
Infrastructure on a fully-diluted basis, depending on the amounts ultimately
required to be funded pursuant to these facilities. If all Prime security
holders (other than BIP) were to receive BIP Units in exchange for their Prime
securities, those former Prime security holders would hold approximately 32%
of Brookfield Infrastructure.

  

  

Process

  

  

The transaction is subject to regulatory approvals in Australia, New Zealand,
Europe and the United States. The Scheme will also be subject to Court
approval in Australia.

  

  

In addition to the approval of Prime security holders of the Scheme as
described above, the transaction is also subject to approval of holders of a
majority of Brookfield Infrastructure units. Brookfield Asset Management has
confirmed that it will vote its approximate 40% holding of BIP Units in favour
of the transaction.

  

  

It is anticipated that meetings of security holders to seek these approvals
will be held in early November 2010, and that the merger will be completed
prior to year end.

  

  

Detailed documentation in relation to both the Scheme and the Bid is expected
to be mailed to Prime Infrastructure security holders in early October 2010.
Materials in respect of the meeting of unitholders of Brookfield
Infrastructure are expected to be mailed shortly thereafter.

  

  

The Scheme is also subject to a number of other matters as referred to in the
attached summary of the merger agreement.

     

Brookfield Infrastructure Partners L.P. (NYSE: BIP; TSX: BIP.UN) owns and
operates long-life assets that generate stable cash flows, require relatively
minimal maintenance capital expenditures and, by virtue of barriers to entry
and other characteristics, tend to appreciate in value over time. Its current
business consists of the ownership and operation of premier utilities, fee for
service, and timber assets in North and South America, Australasia, and
Europe. It also seeks acquisition opportunities in other infrastructure
sectors with similar attributes. The payout policy targets 3% to 7% annual
growth in distributions to unit holders. The Partnership's units
