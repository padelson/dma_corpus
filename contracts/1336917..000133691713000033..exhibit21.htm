AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER

This Agreement and Plan of Merger ("Agreement") is made and entered into as of
November 8, 2013, by and among Under Armour, Inc., a Maryland corporation
("Parent"); MMF Merger Sub, Inc., a Delaware corporation and a wholly-owned
Subsidiary of Parent ("Merger Sub"); MapMyFitness, Inc., a Delaware
corporation (the "Company"); and Fortis Advisors LLC, as the Securityholders'
Agent (as defined in Section 10.1). Certain capitalized terms used in this
Agreement are defined in Exhibit A.

RECITALS

A. Parent, Merger Sub and the Company intend to effect a merger of Merger Sub
with and into the Company (the "Merger") in accordance with this Agreement and
the Delaware General Corporation Law (the "DGCL"). Upon consummation of the
Merger, Merger Sub will cease to exist, and the Company will become a wholly-
owned Subsidiary of Parent.

B. The respective boards of directors of Merger Sub, Parent and the Company
have approved this Agreement.

C. As an inducement for Parent and Merger Sub to enter into this Agreement,
certain individuals who hold shares or options to purchase shares of the
Company will enter into Noncompetition and Non-Solicitation Agreements in
favor of Parent (collectively the "Noncompetition Agreements"), which shall be
effective at the Effective Time (as defined in Section 1.3).

AGREEMENT

The parties to this Agreement agree as follows: 
| 
---|--- 

1.

|

DESCRIPTION OF TRANSACTION 

1.1 Merger of Merger Sub into the Company. Upon the terms and subject to the
conditions set forth in this Agreement, and in accordance with the relevant
provisions of the DGCL, at the Effective Time, Merger Sub shall be merged with
and into the Company, and the separate existence of Merger Sub shall cease.
The Company will continue as the surviving corporation in the Merger (the
"Surviving Corporation") and a wholly-owned Subsidiary of Parent.

1.2 Effect of the Merger. The Merger shall have the effects set forth in this
Agreement and in the applicable provisions of the DGCL.

1.3 Closing; Effective Time. The consummation of the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement (the "Closing") shall take place at the offices of King and
Spalding LLP, 1180 Peachtree Street, Atlanta, Georgia 30309 at 10:00 a.m.
(Atlanta Time) on a date to be designated by Parent, which shall be no later
than the later to occur of (i) the fifth Business Day after the satisfaction
or waiver of the last to be satisfied or waived of the conditions set forth in
Sections 6 and 7 (other than those conditions set forth in Sections 6.6(c),
6.6(d) and 7.4, which are to be satisfied at the Closing, but subject to the
satisfaction or waiver of such conditions), or (ii) December 6, 2013, or (iii)
at such other time and/or date as Parent and the Company may jointly
designate. The date on which the Closing actually takes place is referred to
in this Agreement as the "Closing Date." Contemporaneously with or as promptly
as practicable after the Closing, the parties hereto shall cause a certificate
of merger (the "Certificate of Merger") conforming to the requirements of the
DGCL to be filed with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware. The
Merger shall become effective as of the time that the Certificate of Merger is
filed with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware or at such later
date or time as may be agreed by the Company and Merger Sub in writing and
specified in the Certificate of Merger in accordance with the DGCL (the
effective time of the Merger being hereinafter referred to as the "Effective
Time"). For the avoidance of doubt, all references in this Agreement to
"immediately prior to the Closing" shall be deemed to refer to a point in time
immediately before the Closing and after the conversion of the Preferred Stock
into Common Stock.



1.4 Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws; Directors and Officers. Unless
otherwise determined by Parent prior to the Effective Time:

(a) the certificate of incorporation of the Surviving Corporation shall be
amended and restated as of the Effective Time in a form acceptable to Parent;

(b) the bylaws of the Surviving Corporation shall be amended and restated as
of the Effective Time to conform to the bylaws of Merger Sub as in effect
immediately prior to the Effective Time; and

(c) the directors and officers of the Surviving Corporation immediately after
the Effective Time shall be those individuals designated by Parent in its sole
discretion.

1.5 Conversion of Shares.

(a) Conversion. Subject to Sections 1.5(e), 1.7 and 1.8, at the Effective
Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any further action on the part of
Parent, Merger Sub, the Company, any stockholder of the Company or any other
Person:

(i) each share of Capital Stock held in the Company's treasury or owned by
Parent, Merger Sub, the Company or any direct or indirect wholly-owned
subsidiary of Parent, Merger Sub or the Company immediately prior to the
Effective Time, if any, shall be extinguished and canceled without payment of
any consideration with respect thereto;

(ii) each share of Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to
the Effective Time (all such issued and outstanding shares, other than any
share of Common Stock to be cancelled pursuant to Section 1.5(a)(i), the
"Outstanding Capital Stock") shall be converted automatically into the right
to receive (following the surrender of the certificate representing such share
of Common Stock or the delivery of an appropriate affidavit, in each case, in
accordance with Section 1.8):

(A) an amount in cash per share of Common Stock equal to: (1) Per Share
Amount; minus (2) the Per Share Escrow Amount; minus (3) the Per Share
Securityholders' Agent Amount; and

(B) any cash disbursements required to be made out of the Escrow Amount with
respect to such share to the former holder thereof in accordance with the
Escrow Agreement, as and when such disbursements are required to be made; and

(C) any cash disbursements required to be made out of the Securityholders'
Agent Amount with respect to such share to the former holder thereof in
accordance with the Securityholders' Agent Amount Agreement, as and when such
disbursements are required to be made; and

(iii) each share of the common stock, par value $0.001 per share, of Merger
Sub issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be
converted automatically into one fully paid and nonassessable share of common
stock of the Surviving 

Corporation and shall constitute the only outstanding share of capital stock
of the Surviving Corporation at the Effective Time. From and after the
Effective Time, all certificates representing shares of common stock of Merger
Sub shall be deemed for all purposes to represent the number of shares of
common stock of the Surviving Corporation into which the shares of common
stock of Merger Sub were converted in accordance with the immediately
preceding sentence.

The amount of cash, if any, that each Effective Time Holder is entitled to
receive at any particular time for the shares of Outstanding Capital Stock
held by such Effective Time Holder or the shares of Capital Stock subject to
Outstanding Vested Options (as defined in Section 1.6(a)) or Warrants held by
such Effective Time Holder shall be rounded to the nearest cent (with $0.005
being rounded upward) and computed after aggregating the cash amounts payable
at such time for all shares of each class and series of Outstanding Capital
Stock and all Outstanding Vested Options and Warrants held by such Effective
Time Holder.

(b) Definitions. For purposes of this Agreement:

forth and represented in the Merger Consideration Certificate; plus (D) the
Cash Surplus Amount, as set forth and represented in the Merger Consideration

forfeiture under any restricted stock purchase agreement or other Contract;
(2) any such shares subject to issuance pursuant to Options or Warrants that
are exercised prior to the Effective Time; and (3) any such shares subject to
issuance pursuant to the conversion prior to the Effective Time of any
Preferred Stock); plus (B) the aggregate number of shares of Capital Stock
purchasable under or otherwise subject to Outstanding Options (it being
understood that any other rights to purchase or acquire Capital Stock that
terminate as of the Effective Time, if not exercised prior to the Closing,
shall not be included in the Fully Diluted Company Share Number); plus (C) the
aggregate number of shares of Capital Stock purchasable under or otherwise
subject to Warrants or any other rights (other than Options) to acquire shares
of Capital Stock (whether or not immediately exercisable) outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time; plus (D) the aggregate number of
shares of Common Stock that would be issuable upon the conversion of any
convertible securities of the Company (other than shares of Preferred Stock)
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time.

(ix) "Net Working Capital" means the current assets of the Acquired Companies
on a consolidated basis (excluding cash) less the current liabilities of the
Acquired Companies on a consolidated basis (excluding Cash Items and
Indebtedness), as of immediately prior to the Closing, as determined in
accordance with the guidelines mutually agreed to by the Company and Parent.

(x) "Per Share Amount" means the amount obtained by dividing: (A) the sum of
(1) the Adjusted Transaction Value plus (2) the Aggregate Exercise Amount; by

Capital Stock subject to an Outstanding Vested Option or Warrant.

(xv) "Target Net Working Capital" means $892,082.

(xvi) "Working Capital Shortfall Amount" means the amount, if any, by which
the Target Net Working Capital exceeds the Net Working Capital.

Working Capital exceeds the Target Net Working Capital.

(c) Escrow. An amount equal to the Escrow Amount shall be deposited by Parent
in escrow at the Effective Time, and held and disbursed by the Escrow Agent in

as Exhibit C (the "Escrow Agreement").

(d) Securityholders' Agent Amount. At the Effective Time, an amount equal to
the Securityholders' Agent Amount shall be deposited by Parent with the
Securityholders' Agent (per wire instructions provided by the Securityholders'
Agent prior to Closing) and held by the Securityholders' Agent as the Expense
Fund in accordance with Section 10.1(h).

(e) Payment of Indebtedness. At the Effective Time, Parent shall, on behalf of
the Company, pay to such account or accounts as the Company specifies to

date of this Agreement and the Effective Time, declares or pays any dividend
on Capital Stock payable in Capital Stock or in any right to acquire Capital
Stock, or effects a subdivision of the outstanding shares of Capital Stock
into a greater number of shares of Capital Stock, or in the event the
outstanding shares of Capital Stock shall be combined or consolidated, by
reclassification or otherwise, into a lesser number of shares of Capital
Stock, or a record date with respect to any of the foregoing shall occur
during such period, then the amounts payable in respect of shares of
Outstanding Capital Stock pursuant to Section 1.5(a) and the amounts payable
in respect of shares of Capital Stock subject to Outstanding Vested Options
pursuant to Section 1.6 shall be appropriately adjusted. 

1.6 Treatment of Stock Options and Warrants.

(a) Vested Stock Options. Subject to Section 1.8(h), each Option that is
vested, outstanding and unexercised immediately prior to the Effective Time
(including all Options that vest contingent upon the Merger) (each such Option
being referred to in this Agreement as an "Outstanding Vested Option") shall
not be assumed or substituted with an equivalent option or right but shall
terminate and shall be cancelled at the Effective Time, and the holder thereof
shall be entitled to receive for each share of Capital Stock subject to such
Outstanding Vested Option:

(i) an amount in cash equal to: (A) the Per Share Amount; minus (B) the
exercise price per share of Capital Stock subject to such Outstanding Vested
Option; minus (C) the Per Share Escrow Amount per share of Capital Stock;
minus (D) the Per Share Securityholders' Agent Amount;

(ii) any cash disbursements required to be made out of the Escrow Amount with
respect to such share of Capital Stock to the former holder of such
Outstanding Vested Option in accordance with the Escrow Agreement, as and when
such disbursements are required to be made; and

(iii) any cash disbursements required to be made out of the Securityholders'
Agent Amount with respect to such share of Capital Stock to the former holder
of such Outstanding Vested Option in accordance with the Securityholders'
Agent Amount Agreement, as and when such disbursements are required to be
made.

Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall take all action that may be
necessary (under the Stock Plans or otherwise) to effectuate the provisions of
this Section 1.6(a) and to ensure that, from and after the Effective Time,
each holder of an Outstanding Vested Option cancelled as provided in this
Section 1.6(a) shall cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except the
right to receive the consideration specified in this Section 1.6(a), without
interest.

(b) Unvested Stock Options. At the Effective Time, each Outstanding Unvested
Option shall be converted into and become an option to purchase Parent Common
Stock, with such conversion effected through Parent (i) assuming such
Outstanding Unvested Option or (ii) replacing such Outstanding Unvested Option
by issuing a reasonably equivalent replacement stock option to purchase Parent
Common Stock in substitution therefor, in either case in accordance with the
terms (as in effect as of the date of this Agreement) of the applicable Stock
Plan, and the terms of the stock option agreement by which such Outstanding
Unvested Option is evidenced and otherwise in compliance with the requirements
of Code Sections 409A and 422 such that each such assumed or replaced Option
is exempt from Code Section 409A and maintains its status as an "incentive
stock option" (if applicable), to the extent permitted by the Code. All
Outstanding Unvested Options shall be assumed or replaced by Parent and all
rights thereunder shall thereupon be converted into rights with respect to
Parent Common Stock. Accordingly, from and after the Effective Time: (A) each
Outstanding Unvested Option assumed or replaced by Parent may be exercised
solely for shares of Parent; (B) the number of shares of Parent Common Stock
subject to each Outstanding Unvested Option assumed or replaced by Parent
shall be determined by multiplying the number of shares of Company's Common
Stock that were subject to such Outstanding Unvested Option immediately prior 

to the Effective Time by the Conversion Ratio (as defined below), and rounding
the resulting number down to the nearest whole number of shares of Parent
Common Stock; (C) the per share exercise price for the Parent Common Stock
issuable upon exercise of each Outstanding Unvested Option assumed or replaced
by Parent shall be determined by dividing the per share exercise price of
Common Stock subject to such Outstanding Unvested Option, as in effect
immediately prior to the Effective Time, by the Conversion Ratio, and rounding
the resulting exercise price up to the nearest whole cent; and (D) subject to
the terms of the stock option agreement by which such Outstanding Unvested
Option is evidenced, any restriction on the exercise of any Outstanding
Unvested Option assumed or replaced by Parent shall continue in full force and
effect and the term, exercisability, vesting schedule and other provisions of
such Outstanding Unvested Option shall otherwise remain unchanged as a result
of the assumption or replacement of such Outstanding Company Option; provided,
however, that Parent's board of directors or a committee thereof shall succeed
to the authority and responsibility of the Company's board of directors or any
committee thereof with respect to each Outstanding Unvested Option assumed or
replaced by Parent. The "Conversion Ratio" means a fraction having a numerator
equal to Per Share Amount and having a denominator equal to the average of the
closing sale prices of a share of Parent Common Stock as reported by the New
York Stock Exchange for each of the five consecutive trading days immediately
preceding the Closing Date; provided, however, that if, between the date of
this Agreement and the Effective Time, the outstanding shares of Company's
Common Stock or Parent Common Stock are changed into a different number or
class of shares by reason of any stock split, division or subdivision of
shares, stock dividend, reverse stock split, consolidation of shares,
reclassification, recapitalization or other similar transaction, then the
Conversion Ratio shall be adjusted to the extent appropriate.

(c) Warrants. Each Warrant that is outstanding and unexercised immediately
prior to the Effective Time shall not be assumed or substituted with an
equivalent warrant or right but shall terminate and shall be cancelled at the
Effective Time, and the holder thereof shall be entitled to receive for each
share of Capital Stock subject to such Warrant:

(i) an amount in cash equal to: (A) the Per Share Amount; minus (B) the
exercise price per share of Capital Stock subject to such Warrant; minus (C)
the Per Share Escrow Amount per share of Capital Stock; minus (D) the Per
Share Securityholders' Agent Amount;

(ii) any cash disbursements required to be made out of the Escrow Amount with
respect to such share of Capital Stock to the former holder of such Warrant in
accordance with the Escrow Agreement, as and when such disbursements are
required to be made; and

(iii) any cash disbursements required to be made out of the Securityholders'
Agent Amount with respect to such share of Capital Stock to the former holder
of such Warrant in accordance with the Securityholders' Agent Amount
Agreement, as and when such disbursements are required to be made.

(d) Payment. Following the Effective Time, Parent shall pay through the
payroll services of Parent or the Company to each holder of an Outstanding
Vested Option, the consideration specified in Section 1.6(a), without
interest. Payment of the amounts specified in Section 1.6(c) with respect to
Warrants will be made by the Payment Agent at Closing. 

1.7 Dissenting Shares.

(a) Effect on Dissenting Shares. Notwithstanding any provisions of this
Agreement to the contrary, shares of Capital Stock held by a holder who has
properly asserted such holder's dissenter's rights under the DGCL, and as of
the Closing has neither effectively withdrawn nor lost (through failure to
perfect or otherwise) such holder's right to payment of the "fair value" for
such shares under the DGCL (the "Dissenting Shares") shall not be converted
into the applicable Merger Consideration, but shall be entitled to only such
rights as are granted by the DGCL. Parent shall be entitled to retain any
Merger Consideration not paid on account of such Dissenting Shares pending
resolution of the claims of such holders, and the Effective Time Holders shall
not be entitled to any portion of such retained Merger Consideration.

(b) Loss of Dissenting Share Status. Notwithstanding the provisions of Section
1.7(a), if any holder of shares of Capital Stock who has asserted such
holder's right to payment of the "fair value" for such holder's shares under
the DGCL shall effectively withdraw or lose (through the failure to perfect or
otherwise) such holder's dissenters' rights, then such holder's shares of
Capital Stock shall thereupon be deemed automatically to have been converted,
as of the Effective Time, into the right to receive the applicable Merger
Consideration, without interest thereon, promptly following the surrender of
the certificate or certificates representing such shares of Capital Stock or
upon the delivery of an appropriate affidavit, in each case, in accordance
with Section 1.8.

(c) Notice of Dissenting Shares. The Company shall give Parent prompt notice
of any demands for payment for shares of Capital Stock received by the
Company, withdrawals of any demands, and any other instruments or notices
served or otherwise delivered pursuant to the DGCL and received by the
Company; provided, however, the Company shall control and direct all
negotiations and proceedings with respect to any such demands or other
instruments or notices with reasonable participation by the Parent upon
Parent's request. The Company shall not, except with the prior written consent
of Parent (which consent shall not be unreasonably delayed, withheld or
conditioned), make any payment with respect to, settle or offer to settle any
such demands. 

1.8 Exchange of Certificates.

(a) Payment Agent. On or prior to the Closing Date, Parent shall select a bank
or trust company reasonably acceptable to the Company to act as payment agent
in the Merger (the "Payment Agent"). On or prior to the Effective Time, Parent
shall deposit with the Payment Agent cash sufficient to pay the cash
consideration payable pursuant to Sections 1.5(a)(ii)(A) and 1.6(c). The cash
amount so deposited with the Payment Agent is referred to herein as the
"Payment Fund." The Payment Agent will be instructed to invest the funds
included in the Payment Fund in the manner directed by Parent, but any risk of
loss shall remain with Parent. Any interest or other income resulting from the
investment of such funds shall be the property of, and will be paid to,
Parent.

(b) Letter of Transmittal. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall mail
to each Person who is a record holder of Capital Stock immediately prior to
the Effective Time: (i) a letter of transmittal containing such provisions as
Parent or the Payment Agent may specify (including a provision confirming that
delivery of Company Stock Certificates (as defined in Section 1.8(d)) shall be
effected, and risk of loss and title to Company Stock Certificates shall pass,
only upon delivery of such Company Stock Certificates to the Payment Agent, a
general release and a provision whereby such holder agrees to be bound by the
provisions of Sections 1.8, 9, 10.1 and the other applicable provisions of
this Agreement), in each case as reasonably acceptable to the Company (a
"Letter of Transmittal"); and (ii) instructions for use in effecting the
exchange of Company Stock Certificates for the Merger Consideration, if any,
payable with respect to such Capital Stock. Upon the surrender to the Payment
Agent of a Company Stock Certificate (or an affidavit of lost stock
certificate as described in Section 1.8(e)), together with a duly executed
Letter of Transmittal and such other documents as Parent or the Payment Agent
may reasonably request, the holder of such Company Stock Certificate shall be
entitled to receive in exchange therefor cash in an amount equal to the Merger
Consideration, if any, which such holder has the right to receive pursuant to
Section 1.5(a) at the time of such surrender, the Company Stock Certificate so
surrendered shall forthwith be canceled, and the amount equal to the Merger
Consideration shall be paid to such holder promptly. From and after the
Effective Time, each Company Stock Certificate which prior to the Effective
Time represented shares of Capital Stock shall be deemed to represent only the
right to receive the Merger Consideration, if any, payable with respect to
such shares, and the holder of each such Company Stock Certificate shall cease
to have any rights with respect to the shares of Capital Stock formerly
represented thereby.

(c) Payments to Others. If payment of Merger Consideration in respect of
shares of Capital Stock converted pursuant to Section 1.5 is to be made to a
Person other than the Person in whose name a surrendered Company Stock
Certificate is registered, it shall be a condition to such payment that the
Company Stock Certificate so surrendered shall be properly endorsed or shall
be otherwise in proper form for transfer and that the Person requesting such
payment shall have paid any transfer and other similar Taxes required by
reason of such payment in a name other than that of the registered holder of
the Company Stock Certificate surrendered or shall have established to the
satisfaction of Parent that such Tax either has been paid or is not payable.

(d) Stock Transfer Books. As of the Effective Time, the stock transfer books
of the Company shall be closed and there shall not be any further registration
of transfers of shares of 

Capital Stock thereafter on the records of the Company. If, after the
Effective Time, certificates for shares of Outstanding Capital Stock ("Company
Stock Certificates") are presented to the Surviving Corporation, they shall be
canceled and exchanged for the Merger Consideration, if any, payable with
respect to such shares as provided for in Section 1.5. No interest shall
accrue or be paid on any Merger Consideration payable upon the surrender of a
Company Stock Certificate.

(e) Lost Certificates. In the event any Company Stock Certificate representing
shares of Outstanding Capital Stock shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed,
Parent may, in its discretion and as a condition precedent to the payment of
any Merger Consideration with respect to the shares of Capital Stock
previously represented by such Company Stock Certificate, require the owner of
such lost, stolen or destroyed Company Stock Certificate to provide an
appropriate affidavit and indemnity agreement (in a form reasonably acceptable
to the Company (or Securityholders' Agent after the Effective Time)) against
any claim that may be made against the Payment Agent, Parent, the Surviving
Corporation or any affiliated party with respect to such Company Stock
Certificate.

(f) Undistributed Payment Funds. Any portion of the Payment Fund that remains
undistributed to Effective Time Holders as of the date that is 180 days after
the Closing Date shall be delivered to Parent upon demand, and Effective Time
Holders who have not theretofore surrendered their Company Stock Certificates
in accordance with this Section 1.8 shall thereafter look only to Parent for
satisfaction of their claims for the Merger Consideration payable with respect
to the shares of Capital Stock previously represented by such Company Stock
Certificates, and/or shares of Capital Stock subject to Vested Outstanding
Options, in each case without any interest thereon.

(g) Escheat. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary,
neither Parent nor any other Person shall be liable to any Effective Time
Holder or to any other Person for any amount paid to a public official
pursuant to applicable abandoned property law, escheat law or similar
applicable Legal Requirement. Any Merger Consideration or other amounts
remaining unclaimed by Effective Time Holders three years after the Effective
Time (or such earlier date immediately prior to such time as such amounts
would otherwise escheat to or become property of any Governmental Entity)
shall, to the extent permitted by applicable Legal Requirements, become the
property of Parent free and clear of any Lien.

(h) Withholding. Each of the Payment Agent, Parent and the Surviving
Corporation shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from any consideration
payable pursuant to this Agreement to any Securityholder or former
Securityholder of the Company such amounts as Parent determines in good faith
are required to be deducted or withheld therefrom under the Code or any
provision of state, local or foreign Tax law. To the extent such amounts are
so deducted or withheld and paid over to the appropriate Taxing Authority,
such amounts shall be treated for all purposes under this Agreement as having
been paid to the Person to whom such amounts would otherwise have been paid. 

1.9 Further Action. If, at any time after the Effective Time, any further
action is reasonably determined by Parent to be necessary or desirable to
carry out the purposes of this Agreement or to vest the Surviving Corporation
or Parent with full right, title and possession of and to all rights and
property of Merger Sub and the Company, the officers and directors of the
Surviving Corporation and Parent shall be fully authorized (in the name of
Merger Sub, in the name of the Company and otherwise) to take such action.

the Company's representations and warranties set forth in this Section 2, the
Company represents and warrants, to and for the benefit of the Indemnitees
(with the understanding and acknowledgement that Parent and Merger Sub would
not have entered into this Agreement without being provided with the
representations and warranties set forth herein, that Parent and Merger Sub
are relying on these representations and warranties, and that these
representations and warranties constitute an essential and determining element
of this Agreement), as follows:

Effect. Section 2.1(a) of the Disclosure Schedule accurately sets forth each
jurisdiction where each Acquired Company is qualified, licensed or admitted to
do business.

(b) Charter Documents. The Company has delivered to Parent accurate and
complete copies of the certificate of incorporation and bylaws, memorandum of

Acquired Company, in each case as amended to date and currently in effect
(such instruments and documents, the "Charter Documents"). All actions taken
and all transactions entered into by each Acquired Company have been duly
approved by all necessary action of the board of directors (or other similar
body) and stockholders of such Acquired Company. There has been no violation
of any of the provisions of the Charter Documents of any of the Acquired
Companies, and no Acquired Company has taken any action that is inconsistent
in any material respect with any resolution adopted by such Acquired Company's
stockholders or board of directors (or other similar body) or any committee of
the board of directors (or other similar body) of such Acquired Company.

accurately sets forth: (i) the names of the members of the board of directors
(or similar body) of each Acquired 

Company; (ii) the names of the members of each committee of the board of
directors (or similar body) of each Acquired Company; and (iii) the names and
titles of the officers of each Acquired Company.

(d) Subsidiaries. Section 2.1(d) of the Disclosure Schedule sets forth a
complete and accurate list naming each Entity in which any Acquired Company
owns, holds or has any interest in or right to acquire capital stock or other
equity interests or ownership interests and the jurisdiction of organization
of each such Entity. There are no outstanding securities convertible into or
exchangeable or exercisable for capital stock or other equity interests or
ownership interests in any Subsidiary, or options, warrants or other rights to
acquire capital stock or other equity interests or ownership interests in any
Acquired Company (other than the Company). Except for the equity interests
identified in Section 2.1(d) of the Disclosure Schedule, none of the Acquired
Companies has ever owned, beneficially or otherwise, any shares or other
securities of, or any direct or indirect equity interest in, any Entity. None
of the Acquired Companies has agreed or is obligated to make any future
investment in or capital contribution to any Entity.

(e) Predecessors. There are no Entities that have been merged into or that
otherwise are predecessors to any Acquired Company.

by or on behalf of any Acquired Company (except, in the case of a Subsidiary
of the Company in favor of the Company).

2.2 Capital Structure.

(a) Capital Stock.

(i) The authorized capital stock of the Company consists of 48,700,000 shares
of Common Stock and 14,450,841 shares of Preferred Stock, of which 5,009,016
shares are designated as Series A Preferred Stock, 6,341,825 are designated as
Series B Preferred Stock, and 3,100,000 are designated as Series C Preferred

issued and outstanding; (B) there are 5,009,016 shares of Series A Preferred
Stock issued and outstanding; (C) there are 4,814,503 shares of Series B
Preferred Stock issued and outstanding; (D) there are 3,018,412 shares of
Series C Preferred Stock issued and outstanding; and (E) the Company has no
other issued or outstanding shares of Capital Stock. All of the issued and
outstanding shares of Capital Stock have been duly authorized and validly
issued, and are fully paid, non-assessable and not subject to any preemptive
rights. Except as set forth in Section 2.2(a)(ii) of the Disclosure Schedule,
no shares of Capital Stock are subject to any repurchase option, forfeiture
provision or restriction on transfer (other than restrictions on transfer
imposed by virtue of applicable federal and state securities laws).

(iii) No shares of Capital Stock are held as treasury stock or are owned by
the Company. The Company has never declared or paid any dividends on any
shares of Capital Stock. Since the filing of the Restated Certificate with the
Secretary of State of the 

State of Delaware on June 3, 2013, no shares of Capital Stock have been issued
(other than pursuant to exercises of Options issued to employees of any
Acquired Company under the Stock Plans) and no adjustment has been made,
pursuant to the provisions of the Restated Certificate or otherwise, to the
conversion price of any share of Preferred Stock. No consideration is or was
required to be paid in respect of any share of Preferred Stock upon conversion
of such shares into shares of Common Stock in accordance with the Restated
Certificate.

(iv) Section 2.2(a)(iv) of the Disclosure Schedule sets forth an accurate and
complete list of the holders of all the issued and outstanding shares of
Capital Stock, the addresses of each such holder and the class, series and
number of shares of Capital Stock owned of record by each such holder.

(b) Stock Options. The Company has reserved 7,372,130 shares of Common Stock
for issuance under the Stock Plans, of which options with respect to 6,095,353
shares are outstanding as of the date of this Agreement. Section 2.2(b) of the
Disclosure Schedule accurately sets forth, with respect to each Option that is
outstanding as of the date of this Agreement: (i) the name of the holder of
such Option; (ii) the total number of shares of Common Stock that are subject
to such Option and the number of shares of Common Stock with respect to which
such Option is immediately exercisable; (iii) the date on which such Option
was granted and the term of such Option; (iv) the vesting schedule for such
Option and whether the vesting of such Option shall be subject to any
acceleration in connection with the Merger or any of the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement; (v) the exercise price per share of Common
Stock purchasable under such Option; and (vi) whether such Option is an
"incentive stock option" as defined in Section 422 of the Code or subject to
Section 409A of the Code. Each grant of an Option was duly authorized no later
than the date on which the grant of such Option was by its terms to be
effective (the "Grant Date") by all necessary corporate action, including, as
applicable, approval by the board of directors of the Company (or a duly
constituted and authorized committee thereof) and any required stockholder
approval by the necessary number of votes or written consents, and the award
agreement governing such grant (if any) was duly executed and delivered by
each party thereto, each such grant was made in accordance with the terms of
the applicable compensation plan or arrangement of the Company and all other
applicable Legal Requirements, the per share exercise price of each Option was
equal to or greater than the fair market value of a share of Common Stock on
the applicable Grant Date and each such grant was properly accounted for in
accordance with GAAP in the financial statements (including the related notes)
of the Company. All options with respect to shares of Common Stock that were
ever issued by the Company ceased to vest on the date on which the holder
thereof ceased to be an employee of or a consultant to the Company. The
exercise of the Options and the payment of cash in respect thereof complied
and will comply with the terms of the Stock Plans, all Contracts applicable to
such Options and all applicable Legal Requirements and, as of the Effective
Time, no former holder of an Option will have any rights with respect to such
Option other than the rights contemplated by Section 1.6(a). The Company has
delivered to Parent accurate and complete copies of the Stock Plans, each form
of agreement used thereunder and each Contract pursuant to which any Option is
outstanding. 

(c) Warrants. Section 2.2(c) of the Disclosure Schedule accurately sets forth,
with respect to each Warrant that is outstanding as of the date of this
Agreement: (i) the name of the holder of such Warrant; (ii) the class, series
and total number of shares of Capital Stock that are subject to such Warrant
and the class, series and number of shares of Capital Stock with respect to
which such Warrant is immediately exercisable; (iii) the date on which such
Warrant was issued and the term of such Warrant; (iv) the vesting schedule for
such Warrant; and (v) the exercise price per share of Capital Stock
purchasable under such Warrant. The Company has delivered to Parent accurate
and complete copies of each Contract pursuant to which any Warrant is
outstanding. As of the Closing, no holder or former holder of a Warrant will
have any rights with respect to such Warrant.

(d) No Other Securities. Except for the conversion privileges of the Preferred
Stock and except as set forth in Section 2.2(b) or Section 2.2(c) of the
Disclosure Schedule, there is no: (i) outstanding subscription, option, call,
convertible note, warrant or right (whether or not currently exercisable) with
respect to any shares of Capital Stock or other securities of any Acquired
Company; (ii) outstanding security, instrument or obligation that is or may
become convertible into or exchangeable for any shares of Capital Stock (or
cash based on the value of such shares) or other securities of any Acquired
Company; (iii) Contract under which any Acquired Company is or may become
obligated to sell, grant, deliver or otherwise issue any shares of Capital
Stock or any other securities, including any promise or commitment to grant
Options or other securities of any Acquired Company to an employee of or other
service provider to any Acquired Company; (iv) Contract under which the
Company is or may become obligated to issue or distribute to holders of any
shares of capital stock any evidences of indebtedness or assets of any
Acquired Company; or (v) condition or circumstance that may give rise to or
provide a basis for the assertion of a claim by any Person to the effect that
such Person is entitled to acquire or receive any shares of Capital Stock or
other securities of any Acquired Company. As of the Effective Time, there will
be no outstanding options, warrants, restricted stock or other rights to
purchase shares of Capital Stock or other securities of any Acquired Company.

(e) No Agreements. Except as set forth in Section 2.2(e) of the Disclosure
Schedule, there are no Contracts between any Acquired Company and any
Securityholder, or, to the Knowledge of the Company, among any
Securityholders, relating to the issuance, acquisition (including rights of
first refusal or preemptive rights), disposition, registration under the
Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "Securities Act") or voting of the
capital stock of any Acquired Company (other than Options granted in the
ordinary course of business, including the exercise thereof). Section 2.2(e)
of the Disclosure Schedule accurately identifies each Company Contract
relating to any securities of any Acquired Company that contains any
information rights, registration rights, financial statement requirements or
other terms that would survive the Closing unless terminated or amended prior
to the Closing.

(f) Compliance with Laws. All shares of Capital Stock, all Options, Warrants
and other rights to acquire Capital Stock and all other securities that have
ever been issued or granted by any Acquired Company have been issued and
granted in compliance in all material respects with: (i) all applicable
securities laws and all other applicable Legal Requirements; and (ii) all
requirements set forth in all applicable Contracts. None of the outstanding
shares of Capital Stock 

were issued in violation of any preemptive rights or other rights to subscribe
for or purchase securities of the Company.

(g) Repurchased Shares. Section 2.2(g) of the Disclosure Schedule accurately
sets forth with respect to any shares of capital stock ever repurchased or
redeemed by any Acquired Company: (i) the name of the seller of such shares;
(ii) the number, class and series of shares repurchased or redeemed; (iii) the
date of such repurchase or redemption; and (iv) the price paid by such
Acquired Company for such shares. All shares of capital stock ever repurchased
or redeemed by any Acquired Company were repurchased or redeemed in compliance
in all material respects with: (A) all applicable securities laws and other
applicable Legal Requirements; and (B) all requirements set forth in all
applicable Contracts.

(h) Merger Consideration. No Person will be entitled to receive any Merger
Consideration as a result of the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement or any other Transaction Document, other than
the Securityholders as shown in the Merger Consideration Certificate.

(i) Subsidiary Shares. All of the shares of, and other equity interests or
ownership interests in, each Subsidiary of the Company are owned by the
Company free and clear of any Liens. The outstanding shares of each Subsidiary
of the Company have been duly authorized and validly issued and are fully paid
and nonassessable, have been issued in compliance with all applicable
securities laws and other applicable Legal Requirements and were not issued in
violation of or subject to any preemptive rights or other rights to subscribe
for or purchase securities of such Subsidiaries. There are no options,
warrants or other rights outstanding to subscribe for or purchase any shares
or other securities of the Subsidiaries of the Company and such Subsidiaries
are not subject to any Contract or court or administrative Order under which
any of such Subsidiaries is or may become obligated to sell or otherwise issue
any shares or other securities. There are no preemptive rights applicable to
any shares of any of the Subsidiaries of the Company. None of the Subsidiaries
of the Company has the right to vote on or approve the Merger or any of the
other transactions contemplated by this Agreement. The capital stock or other
equity interests or ownership interests of the Subsidiaries are not subject to
any voting trust agreement or any other Contract relating to the voting,
dividend rights or disposition of the capital stock or other equity interests
of the Subsidiaries

2.3 Authority and Due Execution.

alter the rights or obligations of any Person under, or give to any Person any
rights of termination, amendment, acceleration or cancellation of, or result

audited consolidated financial statements (consisting of a balance sheet,

do not have notes thereto and are subject to normal year-end audit
adjustments) consistently applied throughout the periods covered and on a
basis consistent with the basis on which the Financial Statements were
prepared and in accordance with the Company's historic past practice and
fairly present the consolidated financial position, results of operations and
cash flows of the Acquired Companies as of the dates, and for the periods,
indicated therein. Each Acquired Company maintains a standard system of
accounting established and administered in accordance with GAAP, including
complete books and records in written or electronic form.

maintains a system of internal accounting controls sufficient to provide
reasonable assurance that: (i) transactions are executed in accordance with
management's general or specific authorizations; (ii) transactions are
recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in
conformity with GAAP and to maintain asset accountability; (iii) access to
assets is permitted only in accordance with management's general or specific
authorization; and (iv) the recorded accountability for assets is compared
with the existing assets at reasonable intervals and appropriate action is
taken with respect to any differences. There are no significant deficiencies
or material weaknesses in the design or operation of any Acquired Company's
internal control over financial reporting that are reasonably likely to
adversely affect such Acquired Company's ability to record, process, summarize
and report financial information to such Acquired Company's management and
board of directors; there is no fraud, whether or not material, that involves
management or other employees who have a significant role in any Acquired
Company's internal control over financial reporting; and each Acquired
Company's internal control over financial reporting is effective.

(c) Accounts Receivable. All of the accounts receivable of the Acquired
Companies arose in the ordinary course of business, are carried on the records
of the Acquired Companies at values determined in accordance with GAAP and are
bona fide. No Person has any Lien on any of such accounts receivable, and no
request or agreement for deduction or discount has been made with respect to
any of such accounts receivable except as fully and adequately reflected in
reserves for doubtful accounts set forth in the Financial Statements and as
will be set forth in the Closing Balance Sheet (as defined in Section 4.10).

(d) Insider Receivables. Section 2.5(d) of the Disclosure Schedule provides an
accurate and complete breakdown of all amounts (including any Indebtedness)

be no outstanding Insider Receivables as of the Effective Time.

has changed its methods of accounting, accounting principles, accounting

balance sheet included in the Unaudited Interim Financial Statements; (ii)
current liabilities incurred subsequent to the date of the Unaudited Interim
Financial Statements in the ordinary course of business consistent with past

consistent with past practices described in Section 2.6(a) of the Disclosure
Schedule that are not required under GAAP to be reflected in the Financial

aggregate, to the financial condition or operating results of any Acquired 

Company. None of the Acquired Companies is or has ever been a party to any
"off balance sheet arrangements" (as defined in Item 303(a)(4) of Regulation

is owed and the amount of the Indebtedness as of the close of business on the
date of this Agreement. No Indebtedness of any Acquired Company contains any
restriction upon (i) the prepayment of any of such Indebtedness, (ii) the
incurrence of Indebtedness by any Acquired Company, or (iii) the ability of
any Acquired Company to grant any Lien on its properties or assets. With
respect to each item of Indebtedness, no Acquired Company is in default and no
payments are past due. No Acquired Company has received any notice of a
default, alleged failure to perform or any offset or counterclaim with respect
to any item of Indebtedness that has not been fully remedied and withdrawn.
The consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or any
Transaction Document will not cause a default, breach or an acceleration,
automatic or otherwise, of any conditions, covenants or any other terms of any
item of Indebtedness. The Merger Consideration Certificate will contain a
complete and accurate list of all Indebtedness of the Acquired Companies as of
the Closing Date, identifying the creditor including name and address of such
creditor, the type of instrument under which the Indebtedness is owed and the
amount of the Indebtedness as of the Effective Time. None of the Acquired
Companies has guaranteed or is responsible or liable for any Indebtedness of
any other Person.

circumstance or condition exists, that has resulted in, or that will or would
reasonably be expected to result in, any claim for indemnification,
reimbursement, contribution or the advancement of expenses by any Company
Employee (other than a claim for reimbursement by the Company, in the ordinary
course of business, of travel expenses or other out-of-pocket expenses of a

or consider the applicability of Intellectual Property to Company Products or

developed with the use of Intellectual Property misappropriated from any
Person. The conduct of the businesses of the Acquired Companies (including the
manufacture, distribution, use, and sale of the Company Products and the

same manner as such businesses have been conducted prior to the Closing, will
not infringe, misappropriate, dilute or otherwise violate the Intellectual

event, condition, fact or circumstance that occurred or existed on or prior to
the date of this Agreement and that caused or constitutes a breach of or an

that occurs, arises or exists after the date of this Agreement and that would
cause or constitute a breach of or an inaccuracy

(A) such representation or warranty had been made as of the time of the
occurrence, existence or discovery of such event, condition, fact or
circumstance; or (B) such event, condition, fact or circumstance had occurred,
arisen or existed on or prior to the date of this Agreement; (iii) the
discovery of any breach of any covenant or obligation of the Company; and (iv)
the discovery of any event, condition, fact or circumstance that would make
the timely satisfaction of any of the conditions set forth in Section 6 or
Section 7 impossible or unlikely (each such notice, a "Disclosure
Supplement"). No such Disclosure Supplement shall be deemed to supplement or
amend the Disclosure Schedule for the purpose of (i) determining the accuracy
of any of the representations and warranties made by the Company in this
Agreement, or (ii) determining whether any of the conditions set forth in
Section 6 have been satisfied, except as specifically provided in Section
4.3(b).

(b) Updates. If any event, condition, fact or circumstance that is required to
be disclosed in a Disclosure Supplement first occurs or exists after the date
of this Agreement, does not arise because of a breach of a covenant hereunder,
causes any representation or warranty made by the Company in this Agreement to
be untrue and results in the failure of one or more conditions in Section 6,
then Parent must either (i) terminate this Agreement in accordance with
Section 8.1(f) within ten (10) Business Days of receipt of the Disclosure
Supplement, or (ii) the Disclosure Schedule shall automatically be deemed to
be (x) properly supplemented by and (y) the representations and warranties of

such event, condition, fact or circumstance so disclosed. If the event,
condition, fact or circumstance first occurs or exists prior to the date of
this Agreement, then the Disclosure Supplement will not affect the obligations
of the Effective Time Holders to indemnify any breach of the representations
and warranties of the Company resulting from the event, condition, facts or
circumstances disclosed in the Disclosure Supplement.

4.4 No Negotiation. During the Pre-Closing Period, the Company shall not, and
shall use reasonable efforts to ensure that no Representative of the Company,
nor any Acquired Company nor any Representative of any Acquired Company shall:
(a) solicit or encourage the initiation or submission of any expression of
interest, inquiry, proposal or offer from any Person (other than Parent)
relating to a possible Acquisition Transaction; (b) participate in any
discussions or negotiations or enter into any agreement, understanding or
arrangement with, or provide any non-public information to, any Person (other
than Parent or its Representatives) relating to or in connection with a
possible Acquisition Transaction; or (c) entertain or accept any proposal or
offer from any Person (other than Parent) relating to a possible Acquisition
Transaction. The Company shall promptly (and in any event within 24 hours of

indication of interest, proposal, offer or request for non-public information
relating to a possible Acquisition Transaction that is received by any
Acquired Company during the Pre-Closing Period.

4.5 Termination of Certain Company Benefit Plans. The Company will take (or
cause to be taken) all actions necessary and appropriate to terminate (a) all
Company Benefit Plans that contain a cash or deferred arrangement intended to

termination of the 401(k) Plans to be effective no later than the day
immediately preceding the Closing Date, (b) all group severance, separation or
salary continuation Company Benefit Plans, programs or arrangements of the
Acquired Companies (the "Severance Plans"), with such termination of the

Disclosure Schedule, all other Company Benefit Plans, with such terminations
of such other Company Benefit Plans to be effective on the Closing Date;
provided, however, Parent may, in its sole and absolute discretion, agree to
sponsor and maintain any such 401(k) Plan, Severance Plan, or other Company
Benefit Plan by providing the Company with written notice of such election (an
"Election Notice") at least three days before the Effective Time. For any
Company Benefit Plans to be terminated as described in this Section 4.5, (i)
the Company shall deliver to Parent, no later than the day immediately
preceding the Closing Date, evidence that the Company's board of directors has
validly adopted resolutions to terminate such Company Benefit Plans (the form
and substance of which resolutions shall be subject to review and approval of
Parent). In the event that the distributions of assets from the trust of a
401(k) Plan which is terminated are reasonably anticipated to trigger
liquidation charges, surrender charges, or other fees to be imposed upon the
account of any participant or beneficiary of such terminated plan or upon any
Acquired Company or plan sponsor, then the Company shall take such actions as
are necessary to reasonably estimate the amount of such charges and/or fees

cause all outstanding Insider Receivables to be paid in full.

Closing employee benefit plans and compensation, without the prior written
approval of Parent.

4.9 Resignation of Officers and Directors. The Company shall use commercially
reasonable efforts to obtain and deliver to Parent, at or prior to the
Closing, the resignation of each officer and director of each Acquired Company
from their respective corporate offices (but not their employment) with the

Effective Time and shall be in form and substance satisfactory to Parent.

4.10 Closing Statements. At least five Business Days prior to the Closing
Date, the Company shall prepare and deliver to Parent an estimated

to Parent, in support of the calculation of the amounts set forth therein. The
Closing Balance Sheet shall be prepared in accordance with GAAP and on a basis
consistent with the Financial Statements and in accordance 

with the Company's historic past practice and shall set forth, and contain all
of the information necessary to calculate the Net Working Capital, the Working
Capital Shortfall Amount, if any, the Working Capital Surplus Amount, if any,
the Cash, the Cash Items, the Cash Surplus Amount, if any, and the Cash

Statement will be copies of the Pay Off Letters (as defined in Section 4.11)
delivered in accordance with Section 4.11. Nothing in this Section 4.10 shall
limit any rights of any Indemnitee as set forth in Section 9.

under the agreements identified in Section 2.6(b) of the Disclosure Schedule
to prepare and deliver to the Company and Parent pay off letters, no later
than three Business Days prior to the Closing Date, setting forth (a) the
amounts required to pay off in full on the Closing Date the Indebtedness owing
to such creditor (including the outstanding principal, accrued and unpaid
interest and prepayment and other penalties) and wire transfer information for
such payment; (b) upon payment of such amounts, a complete release of each
Acquired Company, Parent and the Surviving Corporation; and (c) the commitment
of such creditor to release all Liens, if any, which such creditor may hold on
any of the assets of any Acquired Company within a designated time period
after the Closing Date (the "Pay Off Letters"). The Company shall cause the
Pay Off Letters to be updated, as necessary, on the Closing Date.

4.12 Indemnification; Tail Insurance. For a period of six (6) years from and
after the Closing Date, Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to
indemnify and hold harmless all past and present officers and directors of
each Acquired Company (the "Company Indemnified Parties") to the same extent
such persons are indemnified as of the date of this Agreement by an Acquired
Company (including, if applicable, advancement of expenses) pursuant to the
Restated Certificate or the indemnification agreements identified on the
Disclosure Schedule for acts or omissions taken or failed to be taken by such
person prior to the Effective Time in such person's capacity as a director or
officer, as applicable, of any Acquired Company.

(a) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall purchase an extended
reporting period endorsement under the Company's existing directors' and
officers' liability insurance coverage (the "DandO Tail") for the Acquired
Companies' directors and officers in a form mutually acceptable to the Company
and Parent, which shall provide such directors and officers with coverage for
six years following the Effective Time of not less than the existing coverage
under, and have other terms not materially less favorable to the insured
persons than the terms of, the directors' and officers' liability insurance
coverage currently maintained by the Company.

(b) The provisions of this Section 4.12 are intended to be for the benefit of,
and shall be enforceable by, the Company Indemnified Parties and their heirs
and personal representatives and shall be binding on the Parent and the
Surviving Corporation and their respective successors and assigns. 



4.13 Tax Returns.

(a) Each Acquired Company shall prepare and file in a timely manner (taking
into account timely extensions) all Tax Returns required to be filed by it
that are due on or before the Closing Date. On or before the Closing Date,
each Acquired Company shall pay in a timely manner all Taxes that are due and
payable and payable from it on or before the Closing Date. Each such Tax
Return shall be prepared in a manner consistent in all material respects with
past practices employed with respect to the Acquired Companies and, subject to
the foregoing, shall utilize accounting methods, elections and conventions
that do not have the effect of distorting the allocation of taxable amounts
and deductions between the Tax periods covered by such Tax Returns and
subsequent Tax periods. Parent shall have the right to review any such Tax
Return thirty (30) days prior to the filing of such Tax Return, and the
Acquired Companies shall consider in good faith any adjustments to such Tax
Return that are reasonably requested by Parent.

(b) Following the Closing, and except as otherwise provided in Section
4.13(a), Parent shall prepare and file or cause to be prepared and filed in a
timely manner all Tax Returns relating to the Acquired Companies that are due
after the Closing Date with respect to Tax periods beginning before the
Closing Date ("Pre-Closing Date Tax Returns"), and shall timely pay all Taxes
due with respect to such Pre-Closing Date Returns. Pre-Closing Date Tax
Returns shall be prepared, and each item thereon treated, in a manner
consistent in all material respects with past practices employed with respect
to the Acquired Companies (except to the extent Parent's counsel or outside
accounting firm reasonably determines that such treatment is not more-likely-
than-not correct) and shall utilize accounting methods, elections and
conventions that do not have the effect of distorting the allocation of
taxable amounts and deductions between the Tax periods covered by such Tax
Returns and subsequent Tax periods. If any of the Escrow Amount is then held
in escrow pursuant to the terms of the Escrow Agreement, the Securityholders'
Agent, on behalf of the Effective Time Holders, shall have the right to review
any such Tax Return that is an income or other material Tax Return ten (10)
days prior to the filing of such Tax Return, and Parent shall consider in good
faith any adjustments to such Tax Return that are reasonably requested by the
Securityholders' Agent (except to the extent Parent's counsel or outside
accounting firm reasonably determines that such treatment is not more-likely-
than-not correct). Parent shall be entitled to deduct from the Escrow Amount
(i) Taxes due with respect to Pre-Closing Date Tax Returns that relate to Pre-
Closing Tax Periods, and (ii) Taxes due with respect to Pre-Closing Date Tax
Returns that relate to Straddle Periods that are attributable (as set forth in
the definition of "Straddle Period") to the portion of such Straddle Periods
ending on the Closing Date, but only to the extent that such Taxes due were
not taken into account as liabilities in computing the Net Working Capital.

(c) None of Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any Acquired Company shall
amend any previously filed Tax Return of any Acquired Company for any Pre-
Closing Tax Period or Straddle Period without prior review with the
Securityholders' Agent, if the amendment would result in a material increase
in tax liabilities for any period prior to the Closing Date, and Parent shall
consider in good faith any adjustments to such amended Tax Return that are
reasonably requested by the Securityholders' Agent (except to the extent
Parent's counsel or outside accounting firm reasonably determines that such
treatment is not more-likely-than-not correct). Neither the amount of Taxes 

reflected on any such amended Tax Return nor the consent of the
Securityholders' Agent to the filing thereof shall be dispositive of the right
of any Indemnitee to indemnification pursuant to Section 9. For the avoidance
of doubt, nothing in this Section 4.13(c) shall preclude the Securityholders'
Agent from asserting that an amended Tax Return of any Acquired Company for
any Pre-Closing Tax Period or Straddle Period should not have been filed.

(d) Provided that the related Taxes either (i) have been paid by an Acquired
Company on or prior to the Closing Date, (ii) have been taken into account as
a liability in the Net Working Capital, or (iii) have resulted in a claim
against the Escrow Amount in accordance with Section 9, any refunds of Taxes
or credits for overpayment of Taxes that are actually received in cash, or
actually reduce the cash Taxes required to be paid, by Parent, the Surviving
Corporation or any Acquired Company shall be for the account of the Effective
Time Holders, and Parent will, and will cause the Surviving Corporation or any
of their Affiliates to, deliver and pay over (either directly or through the
Payment Agent) to the Effective Time Holders any such refund or the amount of
any such credit within ten (10) business days after receipt. All other refunds
and credits shall be for the account of the Surviving Corporation, Parent or
their respective Subsidiaries, as applicable.

(e) Parent and the Securityholders' Agent shall cooperate, as and to the
extent reasonably requested by the other party, in connection with the filing
of any Tax Returns with respect to any Acquired Company or its operations, and
any audit, examination, or other administrative or judicial proceeding,
contest, assessment, notice of deficiency, or other adjustment or proposed
adjustment with respect to Taxes of or attributable to any Acquired Company or
its operations (a "Tax Contest").

4.14 Intellectual Property Matters. On or before the Closing Date, the Company
shall deliver to Parent a complete and accurate list of all actions that must
be taken by any Acquired Company within 120 days after the Closing Date,
including the payment of any registration, maintenance or renewal fees and the
filing of any documents, applications or certificates, for purposes of
maintaining, perfecting, preserving or renewing any Material Intellectual
Property.

manner reasonably satisfactory to Parent) for approval by such number of
stockholders of the Company as is required by the terms of Section

render the parachute payment provisions of Section 280G of the Code and the

any and all payments and/or benefits provided pursuant to Company Benefit
Plans or other Company Contracts that might result, separately or in the
aggregate, in the payment of any amount and/or the provision of any benefit
that would not be deductible by reason of Section 280G or that would be
subject to an excise tax under Section 4999 

of the Code (together, the "Section 280G Payments"). Any such stockholder
approval shall be sought by the Company in a manner which satisfies all
applicable requirements of Section 280G(b)(5)(B) of the Code and the Treasury

Acquired Company shall) issue or make any press release or public statement
regarding (or otherwise disclose to any Person the existence or terms of) this
Agreement or the Merger or any of the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, without Parent's prior written consent; and (b) the Company shall

5.5 Employee Benefits

(a) Employment; Service Credit; Waiver of Pre-Existing Condition Limitations;
Etc. Parent shall cause each employee of each Acquired Company who continues
to be employed by any Acquired Company immediately after the Effective Time
(each a "Continuing Employee") to be provided with compensation and benefits
that are in the aggregate commensurate with the compensation and benefits
provided to similarly-situated employees of Parent; provided, however, that no
provision of this Agreement shall be construed as a guarantee of continued
employment of any Continuing Employee. Subject to applicable plan provisions,
contractual requirements and applicable Legal Requirements, Parent shall use
commercially reasonable efforts to: (i) credit each Continuing Employee for
their past service with the Acquired Companies for purposes of eligibility and
vesting under Parent's 401(k), medical, vision and dental plans (except to the

of benefits); (ii) grant the Continuing Employees such service credit for
purposes of Parent's vacation leave policy (except to the extent such service
credit will result in benefit accruals or the duplication of benefits); and
(iii) cause any and all pre-existing condition limitations, eligibility
waiting periods and evidence of insurability requirements under the terms of
the employee arrangements of Parent (such arrangements, the "Parent Benefit 

Arrangements") that are group health plans to be waived with respect to such
Continuing Employees and their eligible dependents.

(b) No Third Party Beneficiaries; No Restrictions. Notwithstanding anything in
this Agreement to the contrary: (i) nothing in this Section 5.5 or elsewhere
in this Agreement shall prevent Parent or the Surviving Corporation from
changing its compensation structure or employee benefit programs or obligate
Parent or the Surviving Corporation to provide any particular type or amount
of compensation or benefits to any Company Employee, including any Continuing
Employee, or shall be construed as resulting in any Continuing Employee being
employed other than on an "at will" basis, or as obligating Parent or the
Surviving Corporation to employ any Continuing Employee for any length of time
following the Effective Time; and (ii) no Continuing Employee, and no other
Company Employee, shall be deemed to be a third party beneficiary of this
Agreement.

5.6 Verification of Net Working Capital.

(a) Within 90 days after the Closing Date, Parent shall (i) verify the
calculation of the Net Working Capital, the Working Capital Shortfall Amount,
if any, and the Working Capital Surplus Amount, if any, in each case using the
methodologies used to calculate such amounts at Closing, and (ii) deliver
notice thereof to the Securityholders' Agent.

(b) If the Merger Consideration Certificate stated that there was a Working
Capital Surplus Amount, and the Working Capital Surplus Amount calculated by
Parent and finally determined in accordance with this Section 5.6 exceeds the
Working Capital Surplus Amount set forth in the Merger Consideration
Certificate, then Parent shall pay to the Effective Time Holders (either
directly or through the Payment Agent), within 120 days after the Closing
Date, the amount by which the Working Capital Surplus Amount calculated by
Parent and finally determined in accordance with this Section 5.6 exceeds the
Working Capital Surplus Amount set forth in the Merger Consideration
Certificate. (For example, if the Merger Consideration Certificate stated that
there was a Working Capital Surplus Amount of $3,000,000 and Parent
calculates, pursuant to Section 5.6(a), that the actual Working Capital
Surplus Amount was $3,500,000, then Parent would be required to pay $500,000
to the Effective Time Holders (either directly or through the Payment Agent)
pursuant to this Section 5.6(b).)

(c) If the Merger Consideration Certificate stated that there was a Working
Capital Shortfall Amount, and the Working Capital Shortfall Amount calculated
by Parent and finally determined in accordance with this Section 5.6 is less
than the Working Capital Shortfall Amount set forth in the Merger
Consideration Certificate, then Parent shall pay to the Effective Time Holders
(either directly or through the Payment Agent), within 120 days after the date
of this Agreement, the amount by which the Working Capital Shortfall Amount
set forth in the Merger Consideration Certificate exceeds the Working Capital
Shortfall Amount calculated by Parent and finally determined in accordance
with this Section 5.6.

(d) If the Merger Consideration Certificate stated that there was a Working
Capital Shortfall Amount, and Parent and the Securityholders' Agent finally
determine in accordance with this Section 5.6 that there was a Working Capital
Surplus Amount, then Parent shall pay to the Effective Time Holders (either
directly or through the Payment Agent), within 120 days after the date of this 

Agreement, an amount equal to the sum of the Working Capital Shortfall Amount
set forth in the Merger Consideration Certificate and the Working Capital
Surplus Amount as finally determined in accordance with this Section 5.6.

(e) If (i) the Working Capital Surplus Amount stated in the Merger
Consideration Certificate exceeds the Working Capital Surplus Amount
calculated by Parent and as finally determined in accordance with this Section
5.6, (ii) the Working Capital Shortfall Amount calculated by Parent and as
finally determined in accordance with this Section 5.6 exceeds the Working
Capital Shortfall Amount stated in the Merger Consideration Certificate or
(iii) the Merger Consideration Certificate stated that there was a Working
Capital Surplus Amount and Parent and the Securityholders' Agent finally
determine in accordance with this Section 5.6 that there was a Working Capital
Shortfall Amount, then (without limiting any of Parent's other rights or
remedies under this Agreement), the Effective Time Holders shall pay by wire
transfer of immediately available funds to an account designated in writing by
Parent, an amount equal to such Effective Time Holder's Pro Rata Share of (A)
in the case of clause (i) herein, the amount by which the Working Capital
Surplus Amount stated in the Merger Consideration Certificate exceeds the
Working Capital Surplus Amount as finally determined in accordance with this
Section 5.6, (B) in the case of clause (ii) herein, the amount by which the
Working Capital Shortfall Amount as finally determined in accordance with this
Section 5.6 exceeds the Working Capital Shortfall Amount stated in the Merger
Consideration Certificate or (C) in the case of clause (iii) herein, the
amount of the sum of the Working Capital Surplus Amount stated in the Merger
Consideration Certificate plus the Working Capital Shortfall Amount as finally
determined in accordance with this Section 5.6. Any payment pursuant to this
Section 5.6 shall be treated by the parties as an adjustment to the aggregate
consideration paid in the Merger to the fullest extent permitted by law.

(f) The Securityholders' Agent shall have 30 days following receipt of
Parent's calculation of the Net Working Capital during which to notify Parent
of any dispute with such calculations, which notice shall set forth in
reasonable detail the basis for such dispute. If the Securityholders' Agent
does not notify Parent of any such dispute within such 30 day period, such
calculations of Parent shall be deemed final. If the Securityholders' Agent
notifies Parent of any such dispute within such 30 day period, Parent and the
Securityholders' Agent shall cooperate in good faith to resolve any such
dispute as promptly as possible, and upon such resolution, the calculation of
the Net Working Capital shall be deemed final in accordance with the agreement
of Parent and the Securityholders' Agent.

(g) If Parent and the Securityholders' Agent are unable to resolve any dispute
regarding Parent's calculation of the Net Working Capital within 30 days (or
such longer period as Parent and the Securityholders' Agent shall mutually
agree in writing), following notice of such dispute, such dispute shall be
submitted to, and all issues having a bearing on such dispute shall be
resolved by, (i) the Washington, D.C. office of Ernst and Young, or (ii) in the
event such accounting firm is unable or unwilling to take such assignment, a
"Big Four" accounting firm mutually agreed upon by Parent and the
Securityholders' Agent (such identified accounting firm or, if applicable, the
firm so selected, the "Arbitrator"). Such resolution shall be final and
binding on the parties hereto. Parent and the Securityholders' Agent shall
instruct the Arbitrator to make a final determination of the Net Working
Capital and the Working Capital Shortfall Amount or the Working Capital
Surplus 

Amount, as applicable, based solely on the items that are in dispute and that,
in resolving such items in dispute and in determining such calculations, the
Arbitrator shall not assign to any item in dispute a value that is (A) greater
than the greatest value for such item assigned by Parent, on the one hand, or
the Securityholders' Agent, on the other hand, or (B) less than the smallest
value for such item assigned by Parent, on the one hand, or the
Securityholders' Agent, on the other hand. The Arbitrator shall use
commercially reasonable efforts to complete its work within thirty (30) days
following its engagement. The fees, costs and expenses of the Arbitrator (1)
shall be borne by Parent in the proportion that the aggregate dollar amount of
all such disputed items so submitted that are unsuccessfully disputed by
Parent (as finally determined by the Arbitrator) bears to the aggregate dollar
amount of such items so submitted and (2) shall be paid by the
Securityholders' Agent on behalf of the Effective Time Holders out of the
Securityholders' Agent Amount in the proportion that the aggregate dollar
amount of such disputed items so submitted that are successfully disputed by
Parent (as finally determined by the Arbitrator) bears to the aggregate dollar
amount of all such items so submitted. If any disputes are submitted to the
Arbitrator pursuant to this Section 5.6(f), the calculation of the Net Working
Capital shall be deemed final in accordance with the decision of the
Arbitrator and, to the extent applicable, the agreement of Parent and the
Securityholders' Agent.

5.7 Verification of Cash and Cash Items.

(a) Within 90 days after the Closing Date, Parent shall (i) verify the
calculation of the Cash, the Cash Items, the Cash Shortfall Amount, if any,
and the Cash Surplus Amount, if any, and (ii) deliver notice thereof to the
Securityholders' Agent.

(b) If the Merger Consideration Certificate stated that there was a Cash
Surplus Amount, and the Cash Surplus Amount calculated by Parent and finally
determined in accordance with this Section 5.7 exceeds the Cash Surplus Amount
set forth in the Merger Consideration Certificate, then Parent shall pay to
the Effective Time Holders (either directly or through the Payment Agent),
within 120 days after the Closing Date, the amount by which the Cash Surplus
Amount calculated by Parent and finally determined in accordance with this
Section 5.7 exceeds the Cash Surplus Amount set forth in the Merger
Consideration Certificate. (For example, if the Merger Consideration
Certificate stated that there was a Cash Surplus Amount of $3,000,000 and
Parent calculates, pursuant to Section 5.7(a), that the actual Cash Surplus
Amount was $3,500,000, then Parent would be required to pay $500,000 to the
Effective Time Holders (either directly or through the Payment Agent) pursuant
to this Section 5.7(b).)

(c) If the Merger Consideration Certificate stated that there was a Cash
Shortfall Amount, and the Cash Shortfall Amount calculated by Parent and
finally determined in accordance with this Section 5.7 is less than the Cash
Shortfall Amount set forth in the Merger Consideration Certificate, then
Parent shall pay to the Effective Time Holders (either directly or through the
Payment Agent), within 120 days after the date of this Agreement, the amount
by which the Cash Shortfall Amount set forth in the Merger Consideration
Certificate exceeds the Cash Shortfall Amount calculated by Parent and finally
determined in accordance with this Section 5.7.

(d) If the Merger Consideration Certificate stated that there was a Cash
Shortfall Amount, and Parent and the Securityholders' Agent finally determine
in accordance with this Section 5.7 that there was a Cash Surplus Amount, then
Parent shall pay to the Effective Time Holders (either 

directly or through the Payment Agent), within 120 days after the date of this
Agreement, an amount equal to the sum of the Cash Shortfall Amount set forth
in the Merger Consideration Certificate and the Cash Surplus Amount as finally
determined in accordance with this Section 5.7.

(e) If (i) the Cash Surplus Amount stated in the Merger Consideration
Certificate exceeds the Cash Surplus Amount calculated by Parent and as
finally determined in accordance with this Section 5.7, (ii) the Cash
Shortfall Amount calculated by Parent and as finally determined in accordance
with this Section 5.7 exceeds the Cash Shortfall Amount stated in the Merger
Consideration Certificate or (iii) the Merger Consideration Certificate stated
that there was a Cash Surplus Amount and Parent and the Securityholders' Agent
finally determine in accordance with this Section 5.7 that there was a Cash
Shortfall Amount, then (without limiting any of Parent's other rights or
remedies under this Agreement), the Effective Time Holders shall pay by wire
transfer of immediately available funds to an account designated in writing by
Parent, an amount equal to such Effective Time Holder's Pro Rata Share of (A)
in the case of clause (i) herein, the amount by which the Cash Surplus Amount
stated in the Merger Consideration Certificate exceeds the Cash Surplus Amount
as finally determined in accordance with this Section 5.7, (B) in the case of
clause (ii) herein, the amount by which the Cash Shortfall Amount as finally
determined in accordance with this Section 5.7 exceeds the Cash Shortfall
Amount stated in the Merger Consideration Certificate or (C) in the case of
clause (iii) herein, the amount of the sum of the Cash Surplus Amount stated
in the Merger Consideration Certificate plus the Cash Shortfall Amount as
finally determined in accordance with this Section 5.7. Any payment pursuant
to this Section 5.7 shall be treated by the parties as an adjustment to the
aggregate consideration paid in the Merger to the fullest extent permitted by
law.

(f) The Securityholders' Agent shall have 30 days following receipt of
Parent's calculation of the Cash and the Cash Items during which to notify
Parent of any dispute with such calculations, which notice shall set forth in
reasonable detail the basis for such dispute. If the Securityholders' Agent
does not notify Parent of any such dispute within such 30 day period, such
calculations of Parent shall be deemed final. If the Securityholders' Agent
notifies Parent of any such dispute within such 30 day period, Parent and the
Securityholders' Agent shall cooperate in good faith to resolve any such
dispute as promptly as possible, and upon such resolution, the calculation of
the Cash and the Cash Items shall be deemed final in accordance with the
agreement of Parent and the Securityholders' Agent.

(g) If Parent and the Securityholders' Agent are unable to resolve any dispute
regarding Parent's calculation of the Cash and the Cash Items within 30 days
(or such longer period as Parent and the Securityholders' Agent shall mutually
agree in writing), following notice of such dispute, such dispute shall be
submitted to, and all issues having a bearing on such dispute shall be
resolved by, (i) the Washington, D.C. office of Ernst and Young, or (ii) in the
event such accounting firm is unable or unwilling to take such assignment, the
Arbitrator. Such resolution shall be final and binding on the parties hereto.
Parent and the Securityholders' Agent shall instruct the Arbitrator to make a
final determination of the Cash and the Cash Items and the Cash Shortfall
Amount or the Cash Surplus Amount, as applicable, based solely on the items
that are in dispute and that, in resolving such items in dispute and in
determining such calculations, the Arbitrator shall not assign to any item in
dispute a value that is (A) greater than the greatest value for such item
assigned by Parent, on the one hand, or the Securityholders' Agent, on the
other hand, or (B) less than the smallest value for 

such item assigned by Parent, on the one hand, or the Securityholders' Agent,
on the other hand. The Arbitrator shall use commercially reasonable efforts to
complete its work within thirty (30) days following its engagement. The fees,
costs and expenses of the Arbitrator (1) shall be borne by Parent in the
proportion that the aggregate dollar amount of all such disputed items so
submitted that are unsuccessfully disputed by Parent (as finally determined by
the Arbitrator) bears to the aggregate dollar amount of such items so
submitted and (2) shall be paid by the Securityholders' Agent on behalf of the
Effective Time Holders out of the Securityholders' Agent Amount in the
proportion that the aggregate dollar amount of such disputed items so
submitted that are successfully disputed by Parent (as finally determined by
the Arbitrator) bears to the aggregate dollar amount of all such items so
submitted. If any disputes are submitted to the Arbitrator pursuant to this
Section 5.7(f), the calculation of the Cash and the Cash Items shall be deemed
final in accordance with the decision of the Arbitrator and, to the extent
applicable, the agreement of Parent and the Securityholders' Agent.

arising out of, in connection with or incident to the determination,
assessment or collection of any such Tax: (A) imposed on any Acquired Company,
or for which any Acquired Company is otherwise liable, for any Pre-Closing Tax
Period or for the portion of any Straddle Period ending on the Closing Date

incurred by reason of any reduction in any of the foregoing, whether such
reduction occurs by reason of the carryback or other utilization of such Tax
Attribute by an Acquired Company, the redetermination of the amount of such
Tax Attribute by any taxing authority or otherwise, except to the extent
giving rise to Taxes described in clause (A) of this Section 9.2(a)(iv);

dissenters' rights under the DGCL (it being understood that if a final
determination of the fair value of any Dissenting Shares is made by a court of
competent jurisdiction in connection with any such exercise of dissenters'
rights, then the only portion of such fair value to be included in calculation
of the Damages incurred as a result of such exercise is the amount, if any, by
which such fair value exceeds what otherwise would have been payable by Parent
with respect to such Dissenting Shares in accordance with Section 1.5); 

(vi) the Company Transaction Expenses to the extent not paid on prior to the
Effective Time or otherwise taken into account in the calculation of the
Merger Consideration; or

(vii) the dispute identified in Item 2 of Section 2.7 of the Disclosure

(b) Damage to Parent. The parties acknowledge and agree that, if the Surviving
Corporation suffers, incurs or otherwise becomes subject to any Damages as a
result of or in connection with any inaccuracy in or breach of any
representation, warranty, covenant or obligation, then (without limiting any
of the rights of the Surviving Corporation as an Indemnitee) Parent shall also
be deemed, by virtue of its ownership of the stock of the Surviving
Corporation, to have incurred Damages as a result of and in connection with
such inaccuracy or breach, but in either case the total amount both Parent and
the Surviving Corporation may recover shall not exceed the amount of Damages
of the Surviving Corporation.

(c) Multiple Claims. Notwithstanding the fact that an Indemnitee may have the
right to assert claims for indemnification under or in respect of more than
one provision, representation, warranty or covenant of this Agreement in
respect of any fact, event, condition or circumstance, no Indemnitee shall be
entitled to double recovery (or recovery more than once) for the amount of any
Damages suffered by such Indemnitee to the extent such Indemnitee has
otherwise been already compensated for such Damages.

9.3 Limitations.

(a) Threshold. Subject to Section 9.3(b), the Effective Time Holders shall not
be required to make any indemnification payment pursuant to Section 9.2(a)(i),
Section 9.2(a)(ii) that have been directly or indirectly suffered or incurred
by any one or more of the Indemnitees, or to which any one or more of the
Indemnitees has or have otherwise directly or indirectly become subject,
exceeds $500,000 (the "Threshold Amount") in the aggregate. If the total
amount of such Damages exceeds the Threshold Amount, then the Indemnitees
shall be entitled to be indemnified against and compensated and reimbursed for
the amount of Damages exceeding the Threshold Amount in accordance with and
subject to the terms of this Agreement.

(b) Applicability of Threshold. The limitation set forth in Section 9.3(a)
shall not apply (and shall not limit the indemnification or other obligations
of any Effective Time Holder) (i) in the event of willful misconduct,
intentional misrepresentation or fraud (whether on the part of such Effective
Time Holder, any other Effective Time Holder, any Acquired Company or any
Representative of any Acquired Company), provided that an Effective Time
Holder shall not be liable for the willful misconduct, intentional
misrepresentation or fraud of any other Effective Time Holder in excess of
such Effective Time Holder's Pro Rata Share of the Escrow Amount, or (ii) in
the case of a breach of a Fundamental Representation.

(c) Sole and Exclusive Remedy; Recourse to Escrow Amount. The indemnification
rights of the Indemnitees contained in this Section 9 shall constitute the
sole and exclusive remedy of the Indemnitees for any and all Damages arising
out of or related to this Agreement 

and any certificate required to be executed and delivered in connection
herewith or otherwise executed and delivered at the Closing (but specifically
excluding any Release, Noncompetition Agreement or employment agreement).
Subject to Section 9.3(d), recourse by the Indemnitees to deduction from the
Escrow Amount shall be the Indemnitees' sole and exclusive recourse under this
Agreement for monetary Damages.

(d) Applicability of Liability Cap. The limitation set forth in Section 9.3(c)
shall not apply (and shall not limit the indemnification or other obligations
of any Effective Time Holder) in the event of willful misconduct, intentional
misrepresentation or fraud (whether on the part of such Effective Time Holder,
any other Effective Time Holder, any Acquired Company or any Representative of
any Acquired Company) provided that an Effective Time Holder shall not be
liable for the willful misconduct, intentional misrepresentation or fraud of
any other Effective Time Holder in excess of such Effective Time Holder's Pro
Rata Share of the Escrow Amount, or to breaches of Fundamental
Representations. Subject to Section 10.3, the total amount of indemnification
payments that each Effective Time Holder that was not directly or indirectly
involved in any willful misconduct, intentional misrepresentation or fraud can
be required to make to the Indemnitees pursuant to Section 9.2 shall be such
Effective Time Holder's Pro Rata Share of the Escrow Amount, and the total
amount of indemnification payments that each Effective Time Holder can be
required to make to the Indemnitees pursuant to Section 9.2 as a result of
breaches of Fundamental Representations shall be limited to the aggregate
Merger Consideration such Effective Time Holder was entitled to receive
pursuant to Sections 1.5 and 1.6.

(e) Effect of Indemnification Payments. All indemnification payments made
pursuant to this Section 9 shall be treated by all parties as adjustments to
the aggregate consideration paid in the Merger to the fullest extent permitted
by law.

(f) Insurance. Any claim for indemnification shall be reduced by an amount
equal to all insurance proceeds or other payments from any third party, if
any, actually received by Indemnitee less any increase in premiums or other
recovery costs to such Person as a result of such claim for insurance
proceeds. Each Indemnitee shall use reasonable efforts to pursue all insurance
claims to which it may be entitled in connection with any Damages it incurs
that are indemnifiable under this Section 9. If any Indemnitee actually
receives any insurance or other third party payment in connection with any
claim for Damages for which it has already been indemnified pursuant to this
Section 9, it shall pay to the Parent for further distribution to the
Effective Time Holders in accordance with the terms hereof within thirty (30)
days after such payment is actually received.

(g) Mitigation. Each Indemnitee shall use good faith, commercially reasonable
efforts to defend against any claim that could result in an indemnification
obligation under this Section 9, and will consult and cooperate with the
Securityholders' Agent with respect to the defense and settlement of such
claim, with a view towards mitigating claims, losses, Liabilities, Damages,
deficiencies, costs and expenses resulting therefrom. However, it is expressly
understood and agreed that, notwithstanding the foregoing obligation, Parent,
the Company, and their Affiliates will in all events be entitled to continue
to operate the Company's business in the same manner that it is being
conducted by the Company prior to the Effective Date (or in which the Company
plans to conduct its business as of the Effective Date); that Parent, the
Company and their Affiliates will not be obligated 

to make any changes in the way the Company conducts its business as of the
Effective Date (or plans to conduct its business as of the Effective Date) as
a result of any such claim; and that no Indemnitee will be required to assert
a claim against a third party.

9.4 No Contribution. Each Effective Time Holder waives, and acknowledges and
agrees that such Effective Time Holder shall not have and shall not exercise
or assert (or attempt to exercise or assert), any right of contribution, right
of indemnity or advancement of expenses or other right or remedy against the
Surviving Corporation or any Acquired Company in connection with any
indemnification obligation or any other liability to which such Effective Time
Holder may become subject under or in connection with this Agreement or any
other agreement or document delivered to Parent in connection with this
Agreement. Effective as of the Closing, the Securityholders' Agent, on behalf
of itself and each Effective Time Holder, expressly waives and releases any
and all rights of subrogation, contribution, advancement, indemnification or
other claim against Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any Acquired Company.

9.5 Defense of Third Party Claims. In the event of the assertion or
commencement by any Person of any claim or Legal Proceeding (whether against
the Surviving Corporation, any Acquired Company, Parent or any other Person)
with respect to which any Effective Time Holder may become obligated to hold
harmless, indemnify, compensate or reimburse any Indemnitee pursuant to
Section 9, Parent shall have the right, at its election, to control and
proceed with the defense of such claim or Legal Proceeding with counsel
reasonably satisfactory to the Securityholders' Agent (and for this purpose,
it is acknowledged and agreed that Weil, Gotshal and Manges is satisfactory to
the Securityholders' Agent), and the Securityholders' Agent shall be entitled,
at its expense, to participate in, but not to determine or conduct, the
defense of such third party claim. If Parent so proceeds with the defense of
any such claim or Legal Proceeding:

(a) subject to the other provisions of Section 9, all reasonable expenses
relating to the defense of such claim or Legal Proceeding shall be borne and
paid exclusively by the Effective Time Holders;

(b) each Effective Time Holder shall make available to Parent any documents
and materials in such Effective Time Holder's possession or control that may
be necessary to the defense of such claim or Legal Proceeding; and

(c) Parent shall have the right to settle, adjust or compromise such claim or
Legal Proceeding; provided, however, that if Parent settles, adjusts or
compromises any such claim or Legal Proceeding without the consent of the
Securityholders' Agent, such settlement, adjustment or compromise shall not be
conclusive evidence of the amount of Damages incurred by the Indemnitee in
connection with such claim or Legal Proceeding (it being understood that if
Parent requests that the Securityholders' Agent consent to a settlement,
adjustment or compromise, the Securityholders' Agent shall not unreasonably
withhold or delay such consent).

If Parent does not elect to proceed with the defense of any such claim or
Legal Proceeding, the Securityholders' Agent may proceed with the defense of
such claim or Legal Proceeding with counsel reasonably satisfactory to Parent;
provided, however, that the Securityholders' Agent may not settle, adjust or
compromise any such claim or Legal Proceeding without the prior written
consent of Parent 

(which consent may not be unreasonably withheld or delayed). Parent shall give
Securityholders' Agent prompt notice of the commencement of any such Legal
Proceeding against Parent, Merger Sub or the Company; provided, however, that
any failure on the part of Parent to so notify the Securityholders' Agent
shall not limit any of the obligations of the Effective Time Holders under
Section 9 (except to the extent such failure materially prejudices the defense
of such Legal Proceeding).

If Parent proceeds with the defense of any such claim or Legal Proceeding as
contemplated under this Section 9.5, upon the request of Parent,
Securityholders' Agent hereby agrees to instruct the Escrow Agent to pay to
Parent from the Escrow Amount an amount equal to the reasonable expenses of
Parent relating to the defense of such claim or Legal Proceeding as such
expenses are incurred by Parent (regardless of the provisions of Section 9.6).

9.6 Indemnification Claim Procedure. If any Indemnitee has or claims in good
faith to have incurred or suffered, or believes in good faith that it may
incur or suffer, Damages for which it is or may be entitled to be held
harmless, indemnified, compensated or reimbursed under Section 9 or for which
it is or may be entitled to a monetary remedy (such as in the case of a claim
based on willful misconduct, intentional misrepresentation or fraud), such
Indemnitee may deliver a notice of claim (a "Notice of Claim") to the
Securityholders' Agent. Each Notice of Claim shall state the basis for such
claim and each Indemnitee shall make available to the Securityholders' Agent
any documents and materials in such Indemnitee's possession or control
supporting the claims set forth in the Notice of Claim. In the event the
Securityholders' Agent does not notify the Indemnitee within thirty (30) days
following its receipt of a Notice of Claim that the Securityholders' Agent (on
behalf of the Effective Time Holders) disputes the liability of the Effective
Time Holders to the Indemnitee under this Section 9 or the amount thereof, the
claim specified in such Notice of Claim shall be conclusively deemed a
liability of the Effective Time Holders under this Section 9, and Parent may
claim from the Escrow Amount or, to the extent the remaining funds in the
Escrow Amount are insufficient to cover the amount of such claim and such
claim is not subject to the limitations set forth in Section 9.3(c) in
accordance with Section 9.3(d), the Effective Time Holders shall pay the
amount of such liability to the Indemnitee on demand or, in the case of any
notice in which the amount of the claim (or any portion of the claim) is
estimated, on such later date when the amount of such claim (or such portion
of such claim) becomes finally determined. In the event the Securityholders'
Agent has timely disputed the liability of the Effective Time Holders (a
"Claim Objection") with respect to such claim as provided above, as promptly
as possible, such Indemnitee and the Securityholders' Agent shall establish
the merits and amount of such claim (by mutual agreement, litigation,
arbitration or otherwise) and if an agreement is reached, a memorandum setting
forth such agreement shall be prepared and signed by both parties and shall be
furnished to the Escrow Agent. If such Indemnitee and the Securityholders'
Agent do not reach an agreement as to the merits and amount of such claim
within thirty (30) days immediately after the date such Claim Objection is
delivered to Parent, either Parent or the Company (or the Securityholder
Representative after the Effective Time) may demand arbitration of the matter
unless the amount of the damage or loss is at issue in pending litigation with
a third party, in which event arbitration shall not be commenced until such
amount is ascertained or both parties agree to arbitration. Any arbitration
requested pursuant to this Section 9.6 shall be settled by arbitration
conducted by three (3) arbitrators. Parent and the Company (or the
Securityholders' Agent after the Effective Time) shall each select one (1)
arbitrator, and the two (2) arbitrators so selected shall select 

a third arbitrator. The arbitrator shall, within ten (10) business days after
the last day of any hearings on any motion, issue a definitive ruling on such
motion. The arbitrator shall also, within twenty (20) Business Days from the
last day of any hearings regarding the imposition of sanctions or the issuance
of any awards, issue a definitive ruling on the imposition of any such
sanctions or the issuance of any such award in such arbitration. The
arbitrator shall also establish procedures designed to reduce the cost and
time for discovery, while allowing the parties a reasonable opportunity,
adequate in the sole judgment of the arbitrator, to discover relevant
information from the opposing parties about the subject matter of the dispute.
The arbitrator shall rule upon motions to compel or limit discovery and shall
have the authority to impose sanctions, including attorneys fees and costs, to
the same extent as a court of competent law or equity, should the arbitrator
determine that discovery was sought without substantial justification or that
discovery was refused or objected to without substantial justification. The
decision of the arbitrator, or a majority of the three (3) arbitrators, as
applicable, shall be binding and conclusive upon the parties to this
Agreement, and the Escrow Agent shall be entitled to act in accordance with
such decision and make or withhold payments out of the Escrow Fund in
accordance therewith. Such decision shall be written and shall be supported by
written findings of fact and conclusions, which shall set forth the award,
judgment, decree or order awarded by the arbitrator. Judgment upon any award
rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court having jurisdiction.
Any such arbitration shall be held in Wilmington, Delaware, under the rules
then in effect of the American Arbitration Association.

9.7 Setoff. In addition to any rights of setoff or other similar rights that
Parent or any of the other Indemnitees may have at common law or otherwise,
Parent shall have the right to withhold and deduct any sum that is or may be
owed to any Indemnitee under this Section 9 from any amount otherwise payable
by any Indemnitee to any Effective Time Holder.

9.8 Exercise of Remedies Other Than by Parent. No Indemnitee (other than
Parent or any successor thereto or assign thereof) shall be permitted to
assert any indemnification claim or exercise any other remedy under this
Agreement unless Parent (or any successor thereto or assign thereof) shall
have consented to the assertion of such indemnification claim or the exercise
of such other remedy.

(b) Authority. The Effective Time Holders grant to the Securityholders' Agent
full authority to execute, deliver, acknowledge, certify and file on behalf of
such Effective Time Holders (in the name of any or all of the Effective Time
Holders or otherwise) any and all documents that the Securityholders' Agent
may, in its sole discretion, determine to be necessary, desirable or
appropriate, in such forms and containing such provisions as the
Securityholders' Agent may, in its sole discretion, determine to be
appropriate, in performing its duties as contemplated by Section 10.1(a).
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement or in any
other agreement executed in connection with the transactions contemplated
hereby: (i) each Indemnitee shall be entitled to deal exclusively with the
Securityholders' Agent on all matters relating to any claim for
indemnification, compensation or reimbursement under Section 9; and (ii) each
Indemnitee shall be entitled to rely conclusively (without further evidence of
any kind whatsoever) on any document executed or purported to be executed on
behalf of any Effective Time Holder by the Securityholders' Agent, and on any
other action taken or purported to be taken on behalf of any Effective Time
Holder by the Securityholders' Agent, as fully binding upon such Effective
Time Holder. All actions of the Securityholders' Agent shall be deemed to be
facts ascertainable outside this Agreement and shall be binding on the
Effective Time Holders as a matter of contract law.

(c) Power of Attorney; Immunities. The Effective Time Holders recognize and
intend that the powers of attorney, immunities and rights to indemnification
granted to the Securityholders' Agent and the Advisory Group under this
Agreement: (i) are coupled with an interest and is irrevocable; (ii) may be
delegated by the Securityholders' Agent; (iii) shall survive the death,
incapacity, dissolution, bankruptcy, liquidation or winding up of each of the
Effective Time Holders and shall be binding on any successor thereto; and (iv)
shall survive the delivery of an assignment by any Effective Time Holder of
the whole or any fraction of his, her or its interest in the Escrow Amount. 

(d) Replacement. If the Securityholders' Agent shall die, resign, become
disabled or otherwise be unable to fulfill his responsibilities hereunder, the
Effective Time Holders shall (by consent of those Persons entitled to at least
a majority of the Merger Consideration), within 10 days after such death,
resignation, disability or inability, appoint a successor to the
Securityholders' Agent (who shall be reasonably satisfactory to Parent) and
immediately thereafter notify Parent of the identity of such successor. Any
such successor shall succeed the Securityholders' Agent as Securityholders'
Agent hereunder. If for any reason there is no Securityholders' Agent at any
time, all references herein to the Securityholders' Agent shall be deemed to
refer to the Effective Time Holders. All immunities and rights to
indemnification shall survive: (i) the resignation or removal of the
Securityholders' Agent or any member of the Advisory Group and (ii) the
Closing or any termination of this Agreement and the Escrow Agreement.

(e) Limitation on Liability. Certain Effective Time Holders have entered into
a letter agreement with the Securityholders' Agent to provide direction to the
Securityholders' Agent in connection with the performance of its services
under this Agreement and the Escrow Agreement (such Effective Time Holders,
including their individual Representatives, hereinafter referred to as the
"Advisory Group"). Neither the Securityholders' Agent, its Representatives nor
any member of the Advisory Group (collectively, the "Agent Group"), shall be
liable to any Effective Time Holders arising out of or in connection with the
acceptance or administration of the Securityholders' Agent's duties hereunder
without gross negligence or willful misconduct.

(f) Indemnification. The Effective Time Holders shall indemnify, defend and
hold harmless the Agent Group from and against any and all losses, claims,
damages, liabilities, fees, costs, expenses (including fees, disbursements and
costs of counsel and other skilled professionals and in connection with
seeking recovery from insurers), judgments, fines or amounts paid in
settlement (collectively, the "Agent Expenses") incurred without gross
negligence or willful misconduct on the part of the Agent Group and arising
out of or in connection with the acceptance or administration of its duties
hereunder. Such Agent Expenses may be recovered first, from the
Securityholders Agent Fund, second, from any distribution of the Escrow Amount
otherwise distributable to the Effective Time Holders at the time of
distribution, and third, directly from the Effective Time Holders based on
their respective Pro Rata Shares. The Effective Time Holders acknowledge that
the Securityholders' Agent shall not be required to expend or risk its own
funds or otherwise incur any financial liability in the exercise or
performance of any of its powers, rights, duties or privileges or
administration of the Securityholders' Agent's duties.

(g) Reliance. The Securityholders' Agent shall be entitled to: (i) rely upon
the Merger Consideration Certificate, (ii) rely upon any signature believed by
it to be genuine, and (iii) reasonably assume that a signatory has proper
authorization to sign on behalf of the applicable Effective Time Holder or
other party.

(h) Expense Fund. The Expense Fund shall be held by the Securityholders' Agent
as agent and for the benefit of the Effective Time Holders in a segregated
client account and it shall be used for the purposes of paying directly, or
reimbursing the Securityholders' Agent for, any Agent Expenses incurred
pursuant to this Agreement, the Escrow Agreement or any Securityholders' Agent
engagement agreement. The Securityholders' Agent will hold these funds
separate from its corporate 

funds and will not voluntarily make these funds available to its creditors in
the event of bankruptcy. The Securityholders' Agent is not providing any
investment supervision, recommendations or advice. The Securityholders' Agent
shall have no responsibility or liability for any loss of principal of the
Expense Fund other than as a result of its gross negligence or willful
misconduct. The Securityholders' Agent is not acting as a withholding agent or
in any similar capacity in connection with the Expense Fund, and has no tax
reporting or income distribution obligations hereunder. As soon as reasonably
determined by the Securityholders' Agent that the Expense Fund is no longer
required to be withheld, the Securityholders' Agent shall distribute the
remaining Expense Fund (if any) to the Payment Agent for further distribution
to the Effective Time Holders.

10.2 Further Assurances. Each party hereto shall execute and cause to be
delivered to each other party hereto such instruments and other documents, and
shall take such other actions, as such other party may reasonably request
(prior to, at or after the Closing) for the purpose of carrying out or
evidencing any of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

10.3 No Waiver Relating to Claims for Willful Misconduct, Intentional
Misrepresentation or Fraud. The liability of any Person under Section 9 will
be in addition to, and not exclusive of, any other liability that such Person
may have at law or in equity to the extent based on such Person's willful
misconduct, intentional misrepresentation or fraud. Notwithstanding anything
to the contrary contained in this Agreement, none of the provisions set forth
in this Agreement, including the provisions set forth in Section 9, shall be
deemed a waiver by any party to this Agreement of any right or remedy which
such party may have at law or in equity to the extent based on a Person's
willful misconduct, intentional misrepresentation or fraud, nor will any such
provisions limit, or be deemed to limit: (a) the amounts of recovery sought or
awarded in any such claim for willful misconduct, intentional
misrepresentation or fraud against such Person; (b) the time period during
which a claim for willful misconduct, intentional misrepresentation or fraud
may be brought; or (c) the recourse which any such party may seek against
another Person with respect to a claim for such Person's fraud or intentional
misrepresentation.

10.4 Fees and Expenses. Subject to Sections 1.5 and 9, each party to this
Agreement shall bear and pay all fees, costs and expenses that have been
incurred or that are incurred in the future by such party in connection with
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including all fees, costs and
expenses incurred by such party in connection with or by virtue of: (a) the
negotiation, preparation and review of this Agreement (including the
Disclosure Schedule) and all agreements, certificates, opinions and other
instruments and documents delivered or to be delivered in connection with the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement; (b) the preparation and
submission of any filing or notice required to be made or given in connection

to this Agreement or the enforcement of any provision of this Agreement is
brought against any party hereto, the prevailing party shall be entitled to
recover reasonable attorneys' fees, costs and disbursements (in addition to
any other relief to which the prevailing party may be entitled).

delivered to any party under this Agreement shall be in writing and shall be

during which the income, operations, assets or capital comprising the base of
such Tax is measured, regardless of whether the right to do business for

any such Taxes that is attributable to the portion of the period ending on the
Closing Date shall be: (a) in the case of Taxes that are either (i) based upon

period of the Acquired Companies (and each partnership in which any Acquired
Company is a partner) ended with (and included) the Closing Date; provided,
that exemptions, allowances or deductions that are calculated on an annual
basis (including depreciation and amortization deductions) shall be allocated

beginning after the Closing Date in proportion to the number of days in each 

period; and (b) in the case of Taxes that are imposed on a periodic basis with
respect to the assets or capital of any Acquired Company, deemed to be the
amount of such Taxes for the entire Straddle Period (or, in the case of such
Taxes determined on an arrears basis, the amount of such Taxes for the
immediately preceding period), multiplied by a fraction the numerator of which
is the number of calendar days in the portion of the period ending on and
including the Closing Date and the denominator of which is the number of
calendar days in the entire period.

An entity shall be deemed to be a "Subsidiary" of another Person if such
Person directly or indirectly owns or purports to own, beneficially or of
record: (a) an amount of voting securities of or other interests in such
Entity that is sufficient to enable such Person to elect at least a majority
of the members of such Entity's board of directors or other governing body; or

interests in such Entity.

or withholdings of any sort regardless of whether any such taxes, impositions,
duties, contributions, charges and levies are chargeable directly or primarily
against or attributable directly or primarily to an Acquired Company
(including Taxes imposed on an Acquired Company as a transferee, successor or
by contract), or any other Person and regardless of whether any amount in
respect of any of them is recoverable from any other Person.

D. The Parties acknowledge that the Securityholders' Agent is an agent of, and

In consideration of the promises and agreements of the Parties and for other
good and valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which is
hereby acknowledged, the Parties and the Escrow Agent agree as follows:



ARTICLE 1

ESCROW DEPOSIT



Section 1.1. Receipt of Escrow Amount. In accordance with Section 1.5(c) of
the Merger Agreement, at the Effective Time, Parent shall deliver the Escrow
Amount to the Escrow Agent, by wire transfer of immediately available funds.



Section 1.2. Investments. 



(a) The Escrow Agent is authorized and directed to deposit, transfer, hold and
invest the Escrow Amount and any investment income thereon as set forth in
Exhibit A hereto, or as set forth in any subsequent written instruction signed
by the Parties. Any investment earnings and income on the Escrow Amount shall
become part of the Escrow Amount, and shall be disbursed in accordance with
Section 1.3.



(b) The Escrow Agent is hereby authorized and directed to sell or redeem any
such investments as it deems necessary to make any payments or distributions
required under this Escrow Agreement. The Escrow Agent shall have no
responsibility or liability for any loss which may result from any investment
or sale of investment made in accordance with this Escrow Agreement. The
Escrow Agent is hereby authorized, in making or disposing of any investment
permitted by this Escrow Agreement, to deal with itself (in its individual
capacity) or with any one or more of its affiliates, whether it or any such
affiliate is acting as agent of the Escrow Agent or for any third person or
dealing as principal for its own account. The Parties acknowledge that the
Escrow Agent is not providing investment supervision, recommendations, or
advice.



Section 1.3. Disbursement of the Escrow Amount.



(a) General. The Escrow Agent shall disburse the Escrow Amount only in
accordance with (i) a written instrument delivered to the Escrow Agent that is
executed by Parent and the Securityholders' Agent and that instructs the
Escrow Agent as to the disbursement of some or all of the Escrow Amount
("Joint Written Instructions"); (ii) a final and non-appealable order of a
court of competent jurisdiction or a final arbitration decision that
determines the validity of Parent's Claim (as defined below), specifies the
Damages in respect thereof and instructs the Escrow Agent as to the
disbursement of all or some of the Escrow Amount with respect thereto, a copy
of which is delivered to the Escrow Agent by either Parent or the
Securityholders' Agent, together with a certificate of the presenting Party to
the effect that such judgment is final and non-appealable, from a court of
competent jurisdiction, upon which certificate the Escrow Agent shall be
entitled to conclusively rely without further investigation (a "Certified
Final Order"); (iii) the provisions of Sections 1.3(b)-(d) below; or (iv) the
provisions of Section 1.4(a) below.

(b) Claims. At any time and from time to time following the Closing and prior
to the date that is 30 months following the Closing Date (the "Final
Distribution Date"), if Parent makes a claim (a "Claim") for indemnity or
otherwise pursuant to Section 9.2(a) of the Merger Agreement, Parent shall
deliver simultaneously to the Escrow Agent and the Securityholders' Agent a
written notice pursuant to Section 4.3 hereof setting forth its good faith
estimate of the dollar amount of the Damages in respect of such Claim and the
nature and the basis for such Claim in reasonable detail (a "Claim Notice").
If the Securityholders' Agent does not dispute the Claim as set forth in the
Claim Notice in a timely manner as set forth in Section 1.3(c) below or only
disputes a portion thereof, then the Escrow Agent shall distribute to Parent,
out of the Escrow Amount, the amount of the Damages in respect of such Claim
described in the Claim Notice or the portion thereof not disputed shall be
deemed to be admitted (the "Admitted Liability") with respect to such Claim.

(c) Disputes. If the Securityholders' Agent delivers to the Escrow Agent a
notice of dispute of all or a portion of a Claim made pursuant to Section
1.3(b) (a "Dispute Notice") by 5:00 P.M. 

Eastern Time on or prior to the thirtieth (30th) calendar day following the
Escrow Agent's receipt of such Claim Notice, then the Escrow Agent shall
distribute amounts from the Escrow Amount with respect to such Claim in excess
of any Admitted Liability only (A) pursuant to Joint Written Instructions or
(B) pursuant to a Certified Final Order. Parent and the Securityholders' Agent
agree that, in the event the Parties resolve all matters set forth in any such
Dispute Notice (a "Dispute Resolution"), solely if such Dispute Resolution
results in any amounts payable to Parent (any amounts agreed by the
Securityholders' Agent to be payable to Parent, the "Agreed Amounts"), the
Parties will deliver Joint Written Instructions to the Escrow Agent concerning
the release of the Agreed Amounts within three (3) Business Days after such
Dispute Resolution, at which time such Dispute Notice and the Claim which was
subject to such Dispute Notice will be deemed finally determined for purposes
of this Escrow Agreement and the Merger Agreement. Within two (2) Business
Days following receipt of Joint Written Instructions or a Certified Final
Order, as the case may be, the Escrow Agent shall make payment in accordance
with such Joint Written Instructions or Certified Final Order.

(d) Final Release of Escrow Amount.

(i) Within two (2) Business Days following the Final Distribution Date, the
Securityholders' Agent will deliver written instructions to the Escrow Agent
to release to [___________] (the "Payment Agent") for distribution to the
Securityholders, the balance of the Escrow Amount, less the amount of all
Unresolved Claims (as defined below) pursuant to the instructions set forth in
Exhibit B-2. The Escrow Agent shall release such balance of the Escrow Amount
to the Payment Agent as soon as reasonably practicable upon the Escrow Agent's
receipt of such written direction.

(ii) After the Final Distribution Date, upon the resolution of any portion of
the Unresolved Claims pursuant to the procedures set forth in Section 1.3(c),
and Escrow Agent's receipt of either Joint Written Instructions or a Certified
Final Order with respect to such resolution of Unresolved Claims, the Escrow
Agent shall promptly distribute to the Payment Agent such amount of Unresolved
Claims (which are not otherwise paid or payable to Parent pursuant to Section
1.3(c)) pursuant to the instructions set forth in Exhibit B-2.

(iii) For purposes of this Escrow Agreement, the term "Unresolved Claims"
shall mean, as of the Final Distribution Date, the aggregate amount of all
Claims for which a Claim Notice has been provided to the Escrow Agent and the
Securityholders' Agent prior to the Final Distribution Date and that are (A)
the subject of an outstanding Dispute Notice as of the Final Distribution Date
or (B) Claims for which a Claim Notice has been delivered to the Escrow Agent
and the Securityholders' Agent but for which the 30-day objection period has
not expired as of the Final Distribution Date.

(e) Security Procedure For Funds Transfers. The Escrow Agent shall confirm
each funds transfer instruction received in the name of a Party by means of
the security procedure selected by such Party and communicated to the Escrow
Agent through a signed certificate in the form of Exhibit B-1 or Exhibit B-2
attached hereto, which upon receipt by the Escrow Agent shall become a part of
this Escrow Agreement. Once delivered to the Escrow Agent, Exhibit B-1 or
Exhibit B-2 may be revised or rescinded only by a writing signed by an
authorized representative of the Party. Such 

revisions or rescissions shall be effective only after actual receipt and
following such period of time as may be necessary to afford the Escrow Agent a
reasonable opportunity to act on it. If a revised Exhibit B-1 or Exhibit B-2
or a rescission of an existing Exhibit B-1 or Exhibit B-2 is delivered to the
Escrow Agent by an entity that is a successor-in-interest to such Party, such
document shall be accompanied by additional documentation satisfactory to the
Escrow Agent showing that such entity has succeeded to the rights and
responsibilities of the Party under this Escrow Agreement. The Parties
understand that the Escrow Agent's inability to receive or confirm funds
transfer instructions pursuant to the security procedure selected by such
Party may result in a delay in accomplishing such funds transfer, and agree
that the Escrow Agent shall not be liable for any loss caused by any such
delay.



Section 1.4. Income Tax Allocation and Reporting.



(a) The Parties agree that, for income tax reporting purposes, all interest
and other income from investment of the Escrow Amount shall, as of the end of
each calendar year and to the extent required by the Internal Revenue Service,
be reported as having been earned by Parent, whether or not such income was
disbursed during such calendar year. Not later than thirty (30) calendar days
following the end of each calendar year (and prior to the final distribution
of all of the Escrow Amount), the Escrow Agent shall distribute to Parent out
of the Escrow Amount an amount equal to the product of (i) the amount of
interest and other income required to be reported by Parent and (ii) the
highest combined marginal federal, state and local income tax rates imposed on
Parent in effect during the applicable taxable year (which information shall
be provided in writing to the Escrow Agent pursuant to written instructions
from Parent).

(b) Prior to the date hereof, the Parties shall provide the Escrow Agent with
certified tax identification numbers by furnishing appropriate forms W-9 or
W-8 and such other forms and documents that the Escrow Agent may request. The
Parties understand that if such tax reporting documentation is not provided
and certified to the Escrow Agent, the Escrow Agent may be required by the
Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, and the regulations promulgated
thereunder, to withhold a portion of any interest or other income earned on
the investment of the Escrow Amount.



(c) To the extent that the Escrow Agent becomes liable for the payment of any
taxes in respect of income derived from the investment of the Escrow Amount,
the Escrow Agent shall satisfy such liability to the extent possible from the
Escrow Amount. The Parties (but in the case of the Securityholders' Agent,
solely on behalf of the Securityholders and in its capacity as the
Securityholders' Agent), jointly and severally, shall indemnify, defend and
hold the Escrow Agent harmless from and against any tax, late payment,
interest, penalty or other cost or expense that may be assessed against the
Escrow Agent on or with respect to the Escrow Amount and the investment
thereof unless such tax, late payment, interest, penalty or other expense was
directly caused by the gross negligence or willful misconduct of the Escrow
Agent. The indemnification provided by this Section 1.5(c) is in addition to
the indemnification provided in Section 3.1 and shall survive the resignation
or removal of the Escrow Agent and the termination of this Escrow Agreement.



Section 1.5. Termination. Upon the disbursement of all of the Escrow Amount,
including any interest and investment earnings thereon, in accordance with
Section 1.3, this Escrow Agreement shall terminate and be of no further force
and effect except that the provisions of Sections 1.4(c), 3.1 and 3.2 hereof
shall survive termination. 



ARTICLE 2

DUTIES OF THE ESCROW AGENT



Section 2.1. Scope of Responsibility. Notwithstanding any provision to the
contrary, the Escrow Agent is obligated only to perform the duties
specifically set forth in this Escrow Agreement, which shall be deemed purely
ministerial in nature. Under no circumstance will the Escrow Agent be deemed
to be a fiduciary to any Party or any other person under this Escrow
Agreement. The Escrow Agent will not be responsible or liable for the failure
of any Party to perform in accordance with this Escrow Agreement. The Escrow
Agent shall neither be responsible for, nor chargeable with, knowledge of the
terms and conditions of any other agreement, instrument, or document other
than this Escrow Agreement, whether or not an original or a copy of such
agreement has been provided to the Escrow Agent; and the Escrow Agent shall
have no duty to know or inquire as to the performance or nonperformance of any
provision of any such agreement, instrument, or document. References in this
Escrow Agreement to any other agreement, instrument, or document are for the
convenience of the Parties, and the Escrow Agent has no duties or obligations
with respect thereto. This Escrow Agreement sets forth all matters pertinent
to the escrow contemplated hereunder, and no additional obligations of the
Escrow Agent shall be inferred or implied from the terms of this Escrow
Agreement or any other agreement.



Section 2.2. Attorneys and Agents. The Escrow Agent shall be entitled to rely
on and shall not be liable for any action taken or omitted to be taken by the

professionals. The Escrow Agent may perform any and all of its duties through
its agents, representatives, attorneys, custodians, and/or nominees.

without further inquiry into the person's or persons' authority. Concurrent
with the execution of this Escrow Agreement, the Parties shall deliver to the
Escrow Agent Exhibit B-1 and Exhibit B-2, which contain authorized signer
designations in Part 1 thereof.



Section 2.4. Right Not Duty Undertaken. The permissive rights of the Escrow
Agent to do things enumerated in this Escrow Agreement shall not be construed
as duties.

Agreement.



ARTICLE 3 

PROVISIONS CONCERNING THE ESCROW AGENT



Section 3.1. Indemnification. The Parties (but in the case of the
Securityholders' Agent, solely on behalf of the Securityholders and in its
capacity as the Securityholders' Agent), jointly and severally, shall
indemnify, defend and hold harmless the Escrow Agent from and against any and
all loss, liability, cost, damage and expense, including, without limitation,
reasonable attorneys' fees and expenses or other professional reasonable fees
and expenses which the Escrow Agent may suffer or incur by reason of any
action, claim or proceeding brought against the Escrow Agent, arising out of
or relating in any way to this Escrow Agreement or any transaction to which
this Escrow Agreement relates, unless such loss, liability, cost, damage or
expense shall have been finally adjudicated to have been directly caused by
the willful misconduct or gross negligence of the Escrow Agent. Parent and the
Securityholders' Agent (solely on behalf of the Securityholders and in its
capacity as the Securityholders' Agent) agree that they are jointly and
severally liable towards Escrow Agent under this Section 3.1 but solely as
between them, Parent and the Securityholders' Agent (solely on behalf of the
Securityholders and in its capacity as the Securityholders' Agent) agree that
any obligation for indemnification under this Section 3.1 (or for fees and
expenses of the Escrow Agent described in Sections 2.2 and 3.4) shall be borne
by the Party or Parties (but in the case of the Securityholders' Agent, solely
on behalf of the Securityholders and in its capacity as the Securityholders'
Agent) determined by an arbitrator or a court of competent jurisdiction to be
responsible for causing the loss, liability, cost, damage or expense for which
the Escrow Agent is entitled to indemnification or, if no such determination
is made, then one-half by Parent and one-half by the Securityholders' Agent.
The provisions of this Section 3.1 shall survive the resignation or removal of
the Escrow Agent and the termination of this Escrow Agreement.



Section 3.2. Limitation of Liability. THE ESCROW AGENT SHALL NOT BE LIABLE,
DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY, FOR ANY (1) DAMAGES, LOSSES OR EXPENSES ARISING OUT OF
THE SERVICES PRIVIDED HEREUNDER, OTHER THAN DAMAGES, LOSSES OR EXPENSES WHICH
HAVE BEEN FINALLY ADJUDICATED TO HAVE DIRECTLY RESULTED FROM THE ESCROW
AGENT\'S GROSS NEGLIGENCE OR WILLFUL MISCONTUCT, OR SPECIAL, INDIRECT,
PUNITIVE OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OR LOSSES OF ANY KIND WHATSOEVER (INCLUDING
WITHOUT LIMITATION LOST PROFITS), EVEN IF THE ESCROW AGENT HAS BEEN ADVISED OF
THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH LOSSES OR DAMAGES AND REGARDLESS OF THE FORM OF
ACTION.

Section 3.3. Resignation or Removal. The Escrow Agent may resign by furnishing
written notice of its resignation to the Parties, and the Parties may remove
the Escrow Agent by furnishing to the Escrow Agent a joint written notice of
its removal along with payment of all fees and expenses to which it is
entitled through the date of termination. Such resignation or removal, as the
case may be, shall be effective thirty (30) calendar days after the delivery
of such notice or upon the earlier appointment of a successor, and the Escrow
Agent's sole responsibility thereafter shall be to safely keep the Escrow
Amount and to deliver the same to a successor escrow agent as shall be
appointed by the Parties, as evidenced by a joint written notice filed with
the Escrow Agent or in accordance with a court order. If the Parties have
failed to appoint a successor escrow agent prior to the expiration of thirty
(30) calendar days following the delivery of such notice of resignation or
removal, the Escrow 

Agent may petition any court of competent jurisdiction for the appointment of
a successor escrow agent or for other appropriate relief, and any such
resulting appointment shall be binding upon the Parties.



Section 3.4. Compensation. The Escrow Agent shall be entitled to compensation
for its services as stated in the fee schedule attached hereto as Exhibit C,
which compensation shall be paid 50% by Parent and 50% by the Securityholders.
The fee agreed upon for the services rendered hereunder is intended as full
compensation for the Escrow Agent's services as contemplated by this Escrow
Agreement; provided, however, that in the event that the conditions for the
disbursement of funds under this Escrow Agreement are not fulfilled, or the
Escrow Agent renders any service not contemplated in this Escrow Agreement, or
there is any assignment of interest in the subject matter of this Escrow
Agreement, or any material modification hereof, or if any material controversy
arises hereunder, or the Escrow Agent is made a party to any litigation
pertaining to this Escrow Agreement or the subject matter hereof, then the
Escrow Agent shall be compensated for such extraordinary services and
reimbursed for all costs and expenses, including reasonable attorneys' fees
and expenses, occasioned by any such delay, controversy, litigation or event.
If any amount due to the Escrow Agent hereunder is not paid within thirty (30)
calendar days of the date due, the Escrow Agent in its sole discretion may
charge interest on such amount up to the highest rate permitted by applicable
law. The Escrow Agent shall have, and is hereby granted, a prior lien upon the
Escrow Amount with respect to its unpaid fees, non-reimbursed expenses and
unsatisfied indemnification rights, superior to the interests of any other
persons or entities and is hereby granted the right to set off and deduct any
unpaid fees, non-reimbursed expenses and unsatisfied indemnification rights
from the Escrow Amount.



Section 3.5. Disagreements. If any conflict, disagreement or dispute arises
between, among, or involving any of the parties hereto concerning the meaning
or validity of any provision hereunder or concerning any other matter relating
to this Escrow Agreement, or the Escrow Agent is in doubt as to the action to
be taken hereunder, the Escrow Agent may, at its option, retain the Escrow
Amount until the Escrow Agent (i) receives a final non-appealable order of a
court of competent jurisdiction or a final non-appealable arbitration decision
directing delivery of the Escrow Amount, (ii) receives a written agreement
executed by each of the parties involved in such disagreement or dispute
directing delivery of the Escrow Amount, in which event the Escrow Agent shall
be authorized to disburse the Escrow Amount in accordance with such final
court order, arbitration decision, or agreement, or (iii) files an
interpleader action in any court of competent jurisdiction, and upon the
filing thereof, the Escrow Agent shall be relieved of all liability as to the
Escrow Amount and shall be entitled to recover reasonable attorneys' fees,
expenses and other reasonable costs incurred in commencing and maintaining any
such interpleader action. The Escrow Agent shall be entitled to act on any
such agreement, court order, or arbitration decision without further question,
inquiry, or consent.



Section 3.6. Merger or Consolidation. Any corporation or association into
which the Escrow Agent may be converted or merged, or with which it may be
consolidated, or to which it may sell or transfer all or substantially all of
its corporate trust business and assets as a whole or substantially as a
whole, or any corporation or association resulting from any such conversion,
sale, merger, consolidation or transfer to which the Escrow Agent is a party,
shall be and become the successor escrow agent under this Escrow Agreement and
shall have and succeed to the rights, powers, duties, immunities and 

privileges as its predecessor, without the execution or filing of any
instrument or paper or the performance of any further act.



Section 3.7. Attachment of Escrow Amount; Compliance with Legal Orders. In the
event that any Escrow Amount shall be attached, garnished or levied upon by
any court order, or the delivery thereof shall be stayed or enjoined by an
order of a court, or any order, judgment or decree shall be made or entered by
any court order affecting the Escrow Amount, the Escrow Agent is hereby
expressly authorized, in its sole discretion, to respond as it deems
appropriate or to comply with all writs, orders or decrees so entered or
issued, or which it is advised by legal counsel of its own choosing is binding
upon it, whether with or without jurisdiction. In the event that the Escrow
Agent obeys or complies with any such writ, order or decree it shall not be
liable to any of the Parties or to any other person, firm or corporation,
should, by reason of such compliance notwithstanding, such writ, order or
decree be subsequently reversed, modified, annulled, set aside or vacated.



Section 3.8 Force Majeure. The Escrow Agent shall not be responsible or liable
for any failure or delay in the performance of its obligation under this
Escrow Agreement arising out of or caused, directly or indirectly, by
circumstances beyond its reasonable control, including, without limitation,
acts of God; earthquakes; fire; flood; wars; acts of terrorism; civil or
military disturbances; sabotage; epidemic; riots; interruptions, loss or
malfunctions of utilities, computer (hardware or software) or communications
services; accidents; labor disputes; acts of civil or military authority or
governmental action; it being understood that the Escrow Agent shall use
commercially reasonable efforts which are consistent with accepted practices
in the banking industry to resume performance as soon as reasonably
practicable under the circumstances.

EXHIBIT B-1



Parent Security Agreement



Parent certifies that the names, titles, telephone numbers, e-mail addresses
and specimen signatures set forth in Parts I and II of this Exhibit B-1
identify the persons authorized to provide direction and initiate or confirm
transactions, including funds transfer instructions, on behalf of Parent, and
that the option checked in Part III of this Exhibit B-1 is the security
procedure selected by Parent for use in verifying that a funds transfer
instruction received by the Escrow Agent is that of Parent.



Parent has reviewed each of the security procedures and has determined that
the option checked in Part III of this Exhibit B-1 best meets its
requirements; given the size, type and frequency of the instructions it will
issue to the Escrow Agent. By selecting the security procedure specified in
Part III of this Exhibit B-1, Parent acknowledges that it has elected to not
use the other security procedures described and agrees to be bound by any
funds transfer instruction, whether or not authorized, issued in its name and
accepted by the Escrow Agent in compliance with the particular security
procedure chosen by Parent.



NOTICE: The security procedure selected by Parent will not be used to detect
errors in the funds transfer instructions given by Parent. If a funds transfer
instruction describes the beneficiary of the payment inconsistently by name
and account number, payment may be made on the basis of the account number
even if it identifies a person different from the named beneficiary. If a
funds transfer instruction describes a participating financial institution
inconsistently by name and identification number, the identification number
may be relied upon as the proper identification of the financial institution.
Therefore, it is important that Parent take such steps as it deems prudent to
ensure that there are no such inconsistencies in the funds transfer
instructions it sends to the Escrow Agent. 

Part I

Name, Title, Telephone Number, Electronic Mail ("e-mail") Address and Specimen
Signature for person(s) designated to provide direction, including but not
limited to funds transfer instructions, and to otherwise act on behalf of
Parent.

The Securityholders' Agent has reviewed each of the security procedures and
has determined that the option checked in Part III of this Exhibit B-2 best

BACKGROUND



Parent, MMF Merger Sub, Inc., a Delaware corporation and a wholly-owned

This Agreement will only become effective upon the consummation of the
transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement (the "Closing"), and if the

Section 1(b) shall continue for as long as the applicable information

provisions of this paragraph (b) will not apply to Confidential Information or
Trade Secrets that otherwise become generally known in the industry or to the
public through no act of Securityholder or any Person acting by or on

disclosed by court order or applicable Regulation. Nothing in this Agreement
shall diminish the rights of Parent or the Company or its Subsidiaries
regarding the protection of Trade Secrets and other intellectual property
pursuant to applicable Regulations.



c.Noncompetition.



(1)Acknowledgment. Securityholder acknowledges that the Company conducts the
Company Activities throughout the Territory and that, to protect adequately
the interest of Parent in the business and goodwill of the Company, it is
essential that any noncompetition covenant with respect thereto cover all
Company Activities and the entire Territory for the duration of the Term.

(2)Trade Name. Securityholder hereby agrees that, during the Term, except on
behalf of Parent and its Affiliates, neither Securityholder nor any of his
Affiliates will, directly or by assisting others, own, manage, operate, join,
control, or participate in the ownership, management, operation, or control of
any business conducted under any corporate, product, or trade name or
trademark or service mark of, the Company, its Subsidiaries or Parent, or name
or mark similar thereto, without the prior written consent of Parent.

(3)Noncompetition Covenant. Securityholder hereby agrees that, during the
Term, except on behalf of Parent and its Affiliates, neither Securityholder
nor any of his Affiliates will, directly or by assisting others, conduct
Company Activities in the Territory or otherwise engage in, have an equity or
profit interest in, loan money to or render services (of an executive,
management, marketing, sales, research and development, business development,
strategic planning, administrative, financial, or consulting nature) to or on
behalf of any Person engaged in Company Activities in the Territory.
Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, Securityholder may
acquire up to one percent (1%) of any class of securities of any company
engaged in Company Activities in the Territory where such securities are
publicly traded on a national securities exchange or in the over-the-counter
market so long as Securityholder holds such securities as a passive investment
and does not take an active part in the management or direction of such
company and does not act as a consultant therefor or in any way render
services thereto.



(4)Nonsolicitation. 



(A) Securityholder hereby agrees that, during the Term, except on behalf of
Parent and its Affiliates, neither Securityholder nor any of his Affiliates
will, directly or by assisting others, (1) solicit or attempt to solicit, any
business from any Person who was a customer of the Company or any Subsidiary
as of the Closing Date or at any time during the one-year period prior to the
Closing Date, including actively sought prospective customers, for purposes of
providing products or services that are competitive with the Company
Activities, or (2) provide to any such customer or prospective customer
products or services that are competitive with the Company Activities.



(B) Securityholder hereby agrees that, during the Term, neither Securityholder
nor any of his Affiliates will (on behalf of Securityholder or any other
Person), directly or by assisting others, hire, recruit, or solicit or attempt
to hire, recruit, or solicit, any person who was an employee of the Company or
any Subsidiary on the Closing Date, it being understood that this Section
1(c)(4)(B) shall not restrict Securityholder or its Affiliates from placing
notices of general solicitation of employment; provided that, for purposes of
clarification, such notices shall not relieve Securityholder or its Affiliates
from the restriction against hiring in this Section 1(c)(4)(B).



d.Reformability. If a judicial or arbitral determination is made that any
provision of this Agreement constitutes an unreasonable or otherwise
unenforceable restriction against Securityholder, such provision shall be
rendered void only to the extent that such judicial or arbitral determination
finds the provision to be unreasonable or otherwise unenforceable with respect
to Securityholder. In this regard, Securityholder hereby agrees that any
judicial or arbitral authority construing this Agreement shall be empowered to
reform any portion of the Territory, any prohibited business activity or any
time period in order to make the covenants herein binding and enforceable with
respect to Securityholder, and to apply the provisions of this Agreement and
to enforce against Securityholder the remaining portion of the Territory, the
remaining business activities, and the remaining time period as such judicial
or arbitral authority determines to be reasonable and enforceable. All of the
covenants contained in this Agreement shall be construed as an agreement
independent of any other provisions in this Agreement, and the existence of
any claim or cause of action Securityholder may have against Parent (other
than in connection with a material breach of this Agreement by Parent) shall
not constitute a defense to the enforcement by Parent to such covenants.
Moreover, notwithstanding the fact that any provision of this Agreement is
determined not to be specifically enforceable, Parent shall nevertheless be
entitled to recover monetary damages as a result of the breach of such
provision by Securityholder.



e.Indemnification. Securityholder hereby agrees to indemnify and hold
harmless, to the fullest extent permitted by law, Parent and its Affiliates
from, against and in respect of any and all losses, damages, deficiencies,
awards, assessments, judgments, fines, penalties, costs and expenses
(including reasonable legal fees and expenses) incurred as a result of any
breach or default in the 

performance by Securityholder or any of his Affiliates of any covenant or
agreement of Securityholder contained in this Agreement.



f.Injunctive Relief. The parties to this Agreement agree that, in the event of
any breach or threatened breach by Securityholder of any covenant, obligation
or other provision set forth in this Agreement: (a) Parent shall be entitled
(in addition to any other remedy that may be available to it) to seek: (i) a
decree or order of specific performance or mandamus to enforce the observance
and performance of such covenant, obligation or other provision; and (ii) an
injunction restraining such breach or threatened breach; and (b) Parent shall
not be required to provide any bond or other security in connection with any
such decree, order or injunction or in connection with any related action or
Proceeding.



g.Legal Process. In the event that Securityholder or any of his Affiliates is
requested or required (by deposition, interrogatories, requests for
information or documents in legal proceedings, subpoenas, civil investigative
demand or similar process), in connection with any Proceeding, to disclose any
Confidential Information or Trade Secrets during the applicable period
specified in Section 1(b), Securityholder will give Parent prompt written
notice of such request or requirement so that Parent may, at Parent's expense,
seek an appropriate protective order or other remedy and/or waive compliance
with the provisions of this Agreement, and Securityholder will cooperate with
Parent to obtain such protective order. In the event that such protective
order or other remedy is not obtained or Parent waives in writing compliance
with the relevant provisions of this Agreement, Securityholder will furnish
only that portion of the Confidential Information or Trade Secrets which is
legally required to be disclosed.



2.Miscellaneous.



a.Entire Agreement; Assignment. This Agreement, the Merger Agreement and the
other agreements referred to in the Merger Agreement set forth the entire
understanding of the Parties relating to the subject matter hereof and thereof
and supersede all prior agreements and understandings among or between any of
the parties relating to the subject matter hereof and thereof. Securityholder
shall not be entitled to assign or delegate any of its rights or obligations
hereunder without the prior written consent of Parent. Any assignment by
Securityholder in violation of this provision shall be void.

gender shall include the feminine and neuter genders; the feminine gender
