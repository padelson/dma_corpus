Contribution. Immediately following the Contribution and through the execution
hereof the Company has been, and from the execution hereof until the

Liability Company Agreement attached hereto as _Exhibit G_ (the " _LLC

was converted into one Unit. Immediately following the Conversion through the
execution hereof, the Aggregate Units have constituted, and from the
execution hereof until the Closing, the Aggregate Units will constitute, all

and complete list of all registered and material unregistered Marks and
Copyrights, and issued Patents, including any pending applications to register

the Company or any of its Subsidiaries (" _Registered IP_ "), including in
each case, the registered owner, jurisdiction, expiration date, registration
number and application number. _Schedule 3.15(a)(ii)_ of the Disclosure
Schedules sets forth a true and complete list of all Software owned (in whole
or in part) by or exclusively licensed to the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries, identifying for each whether it is owned by or exclusively
licensed to the Company or the relevant Subsidiary. The Company or one of its
Subsidiaries is the sole and exclusive beneficial and, with respect to
applications and registrations (including Patents), record owner of all
Registered IP. _Schedule 3.15(a)(iii)_ of the Disclosure Schedules sets forth
a list of all actions that, as of the date hereof, are required to be taken
by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries within 180 days following the date
of this Agreement for the purposes of obtaining, maintaining, perfecting,

(b) _Schedule 3.15(b)(i)_ of the Disclosure Schedules sets forth a
complete and accurate list of all license agreements for Open Source
Materials which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries utilizes, other than
Open Source Materials used strictly for internal use purposes. Except as

any Open Source Materials by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries (i) is
permissible, (ii) does not infringe upon the rights of any Person, (iii) does
not violate any agreements, constraints, requirements or restrictions on or
relating to such Open Source Materials and (iv) does not obligate the Company

Open Source Materials are used or held for use under any license
that requires disclosure of the source code of any Software created or used
by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries. No such Open Source Materials are
or have been incorporated or otherwise integrated into, aggregated, compiled
or distributed with the Companys or its Subsidiaries proprietary software.

 



27 (c) The Company or its Subsidiaries exclusively own or have a valid
right to use, free and clear of any and all Encumbrances, all Company Owned
IP. The Company Owned IP is sufficient for the conduct of the business of the
Company and its Subsidiaries. The Company and its Subsidiaries have taken all
necessary steps to prosecute, maintain and preserve their legal rights and
ownership interests in all Company Owned IP. Neither the Company nor any of
its Subsidiaries has received any notice or claim challenging the Companys or
any of its Subsidiaries ownership of any Company Owned IP.

(d) All Company Owned IP is valid, subsisting and enforceable, and neither
the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has received any notice or claim
challenging the validity or enforceability of any Company Owned IP or alleging
any misuse of such Company Owned IP. To the knowledge of the MBS Parties,
neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has taken any action or
failed to take any action that could reasonably be expected to result in the
abandonment, cancellation, forfeiture, relinquishment, invalidation or
unenforceability of any of the Company Owned IP (including the failure to pay
any filing, examination, issuance, post registration and maintenance fees or
annuities).

 

(e) Each of the Company and its Subsidiaries has taken reasonable steps to
protect its rights in Company Owned IP and maintain the confidentiality of
information that constitutes or constituted a Trade Secret of the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries. There has not been any disclosure of any Trade Secret
of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to any Person in a manner that has
resulted in the loss of trade secret or other rights in and to such
information. By Closing, all current and former employees, officers,
consultants and contractors of the Company and any of its Subsidiaries who
have developed Intellectual Property that was or is used in the business of
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries will have executed and delivered to the
Company confidentiality and assignment agreements substantially in the
Companys standard forms, and no such current or former employee or officer
of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries will have excluded works or
inventions from his or her assignment of inventions.

 

(f) The development, manufacture, sale, distribution or other commercial
exploitation of products, the provision of any services by or on behalf of
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, and all of the other conduct,
activities or operations of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, have not,
infringed upon, misappropriated, diluted, constituted the unauthorized use of
or otherwise violated any Intellectual Property rights of any Person, and
neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has received any written
notice or claim, nor has been sued in any Action, asserting, suggesting or
threatening (including in the form of offers or invitations to obtain a
license) that any such infringement, misappropriation, dilution, unauthorized
use or other violation is or may be occurring or has or may have occurred. No
Company Owned IP is subject to any outstanding order, judgment, decree,
stipulation, writ or agreement restricting the use or licensing thereof by the
Company or its Subsidiaries. To the knowledge of the MBS Parties, no Person is
infringing, misappropriating, diluting, using without authorization or
otherwise violating any Company Owned IP, and no such claim has been asserted
or threatened by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries against any Person.
Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has brought any Action for
infringement or misappropriation of any Intellectual Property.

 



28 (g) Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has
transferred ownership of, or granted any exclusive license with respect to,
any Company Owned IP. Upon the consummation of the Closing, the Buyer shall
succeed to all of the Company Owned IP and all of such rights shall be
exercisable by the Buyer to the same extent as by the Company and its
Subsidiaries prior to the Closing.

(h) The execution, delivery and performance by such MBS Party of this
Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements, and the consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby, will not give rise to any right of any third
party to terminate or re-price or modify any of the Companys or any of its
Subsidiaries rights or obligations under any agreement under which any right
or license of or under any Company Owned IP is granted to or by the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries.

 

(i) The Company or one of its Subsidiaries owns, or has rights to access
and use or hold for use, all electronic data processing, information, record
keeping, communications, telecommunications, account management, inventory
management and other computer systems (including data, databases and hardware)
and related content (collectively, the " _IT Systems_ ") used to process,
store, maintain and operate data, information and functions used in connection
with the operation of their businesses as presently conducted, including
systems to operate payroll, accounting, billing and receivables, payables,
inventory, asset tracking, customer service and human resources functions. The
Company and its Subsidiaries have taken reasonable steps to secure the IT
Systems from unauthorized access or use by any Person, and to ensure
the continued, uninterrupted and error-free operation of the IT Systems.
There have been no material security breaches in the Companys or any of its
Subsidiaries IT Systems, and there have been no disruptions in the Companys
or any of its Subsidiaries IT Systems that materially adversely affected the
Companys or any of its Subsidiaries businesses or operations.

 

(j) The IT Systems are adequate in all respects for their intended use and
for the operation of the businesses of the Company and its Subsidiaries as
currently operated. The IT Systems and Software are free of all viruses,
worms, Trojan horses and other known contaminants and do not contain any bugs,
errors or problems of a nature designed to disrupt, disable or otherwise
impair the functioning of any IT Systems or Software, except, in each case, as
would not have or be reasonably expected to have an effect that is materially
adverse to the Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole. Neither the
Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has delivered, licensed or made
available, and has no duty or obligation (whether present, contingent or
otherwise) to deliver, license or make available, the source code for any
Software to any escrow agent or other Person who is not, as of the date of
this Agreement, an employee of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries. There
has not been any malfunction with respect to any of the IT Systems that has
not been remedied or replaced, except as would not have or be reasonably
expected to have an effect that is materially adverse to the Company and its
Subsidiaries, taken as a whole.

 

(k) Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries is required to include
on any Software products of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries the logos,
trademarks, or branding of any third-party or make any particular attribution
to a third-party on or in such Software or in that Softwares documentation.

Section 5.4 _Non-Competition;  Non-Solicitation_.

(a) For a period of three years following the Closing, the MBS Parties

in delivering or receiving primary, secondary or post-secondary instruction

control, render financial assistance to, receive any economic benefit from,
exert any influence upon, participate in, render services or advice to, or
allow any of its officers or employees to be connected as an officer,

any business or Person that competes in whole or in part with the Business;
_provided_ , _however_ , that for purposes of this Section 5.4, (i) ownership
of securities having no more than one percent of the outstanding voting power
of any competitors which are listed on any national securities exchange shall
not be deemed to be a violation of this Section 5.4 as long as the person
owning such securities has no other connection or relationship with such
competitor and (ii) ownership of Buyer common stock or BKS common stock by
Leonard Riggio and his Affiliates, as well as serving as an executive officer,
director, employee or consultant of BKS and any of its Subsidiaries, shall not

forth in this Section 5.4 are an essential element of this Agreement and that
any breach by the MBS Parties of any provision of this Section 5.4 will result
in irreparable injury to the Buyer. The MBS Parties acknowledge that in the
event of such a breach, in addition to all other

 



47  remedies available at law, the Buyer shall be entitled to equitable relief,
including injunctive relief. The MBS Parties have independently consulted with
their counsel and after such consultation agree that the covenants set forth
in this Section 5.4 are reasonable and proper to protect the legitimate
interest of the Buyer.

 

(c) If a court of competent jurisdiction determines that the character,
duration or geographical scope of the provisions of this Section 5.4 are
unreasonable, it is the intention and the agreement of the parties that these
provisions shall be construed by the court in such a manner as to impose only
those restrictions on the MBS Parties conduct that are reasonable in light
of the circumstances and as are necessary to assure to the Buyer the benefits
of this Agreement. If, in any judicial proceeding, a court shall refuse to
enforce all of the separate covenants of this Section 5.4 because taken
together they are more extensive than necessary to assure to the Buyer the
intended benefits of this Agreement, it is expressly understood and agreed by
the parties that the provisions hereof that, if eliminated, would permit
the remaining separate provisions to be enforced in such proceeding, shall be
deemed eliminated, for the purposes of such proceeding, from this Agreement.

Restricted Payment Recovery Amount(s) does not, or when any such amounts are
taken together do not, exceed $500,000, then the Buyer shall first seek
recovery of any such Restricted Payment Recovery Amount(s) from the Indemnity

Returns required to be filed and shall pay all Taxes due with respect to such
Tax Returns; provided that the Designated Representative shall reimburse the
Buyer in accordance with the procedures set forth in Section 6.6 for any
amounts owed by HoldCo pursuant to Sections 6.2 and 6.6 with respect to the
taxable periods covered by such Tax Returns. No later than thirty (30) days
prior to any such filing, the Buyer shall deliver to the Designated
Representative such Tax Returns for the Designated Representatives review and
comment. With respect to any transactions of the Company and its Subsidiaries
occurring outside the ordinary course of business and not contemplated in this
Agreement on the Closing Date that are properly allocable to the portion of
the Closing Date after the Closing shall be allocated to the taxable year or
period that is deemed to begin at the beginning of the day following the
Closing Date.

(b) The Buyer shall not file or cause to be filed an amended Tax Return on
behalf of the Company or its Subsidiaries for any Pre-Closing Tax Period with
respect to which HoldCo and the Shareholders or Unitholders, as the case may
be, will be liable pursuant to this Agreement without obtaining the prior
written consent of the Designated Representative, which

 



56  shall not be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned. HoldCo shall not
file or cause to be filed an amended Tax Return on behalf of the Company or
its Subsidiaries for any Pre-Closing Tax Period with respect to which the
Company will make tax distributions pursuant to Section 6.7 of this Agreement
without obtaining the prior written consent of the Buyer, which shall not
be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned.

(c) The income Tax Returns of the Company and HoldCo that include the Pre-
Closing Tax Period that ends on the Closing Date shall reflect all deductions
and exclusions from income to which the Company or HoldCo is entitled
(including by election) with respect to the Company and its Subsidiaries for
such period. For purposes of preparing such Tax Returns and calculating
Taxable Income in determining the Tax Distribution Amount: (a) there shall not
be any deduction for paperback book returns pursuant to Code Section 458; (b)
there shall not be any deduction for healthcare claims paid after the Closing
Date; (c) liabilities and reserves shall be based upon the Companys
historical method of accounting; (d) assumptions of liabilities by Buyer
pursuant to the deemed sale of assets of the Company described in Section 6.8
shall not be included in Taxable Income by the Company and shall be included
in Taxable Income by HoldCo (with corresponding deductions); and (e) deferred
rental income shall be included in Taxable Income.

Section 6.2 _Allocation of Straddle Period Taxes_. For purposes of this
Agreement, in the case of any Taxes of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
that are payable with respect to any Straddle Period, the amount of such Taxes
allocable to the portion of the Straddle Period ending on and including, and
the portion of the Straddle Period beginning after, the Closing Date shall be
determined by assuming that the Straddle Period consisted of two taxable
periods, one that ended at the close of the Closing Date and the other that
began at the beginning of the day following the Closing Date, and items of
income, gain and deduction, loss or credit and state and local apportionment
factors of the Company and its Subsidiaries for the Straddle Period shall be
allocated between such two taxable periods on a "closing of the books basis"
by assuming that the taxable period of the applicable entity ended on the
Closing Date; provided, however, that (a) exemptions, allowances or deductions
that are calculated on an annual basis, such as depreciation, and (b)
periodic Taxes, such as property or similar ad valorem Taxes, shall be
apportioned ratably between such periods on the basis of the number of days
elapsed in each such period.

 

Section 6.3 _Cooperation_. The Buyer, the Company, HoldCo and the
Designated Representative shall cooperate fully, as and to the extent
reasonably requested by the other parties, in connection with the preparation
and filing of all Tax Returns and any Tax Claim or other proceeding with
respect to Taxes. Such cooperation shall include the retention and (upon the
other parties request) the provision of records and information that are
reasonably relevant to any such matter and making employees available on a
mutually convenient basis to provide additional information and explanation of
any material provided hereunder. The Buyer and the Company shall (a) retain
all books and records with respect to Tax matters pertinent to such entities
and relating to any taxable period beginning before the Closing Date until the
expiration of the statute of limitations of the relevant taxable periods (and
any extension thereof), and to abide by all record retention agreements
entered into with any Governmental Authority, and (b) give the Designated
Representative written notice prior to transferring, destroying or discarding
any such books and records and, if the Designated Representative so requests,
the Company and the Buyer shall allow the Designated Representative to take
possession of such books and records.

 



57 Section 6.4 _Tax Claims_.

 

(a) The Buyer, the Company, HoldCo and the Designated Representative shall
promptly notify each other in writing upon receipt of any notice of any
pending or threatened claim, audit, notice of deficiency, examination,
assessment, or any other proceeding (collectively a " _Tax Claim_ ") which may
affect any Tax liability for which the other party is liable.

(b) The Designated Representative shall have the right to (i) represent the
interests of the Company in any Tax Claim relating solely to any Pre-Closing
Tax Period for which HoldCo and the Shareholders or Unitholders, as the case
may be, will be solely liable and (ii) employ counsel of the
Designated Representatives choice in connection therewith; provided,
however, that with respect to any such Tax Claim, the Buyer shall have the
right, directly or through its designated representatives, to review in
advance and comment upon all submissions made in the course of such Tax Claim
and otherwise participate in such Tax Claim, and the Designated Representative
shall not settle or otherwise dispose of any such Tax Claim without obtaining
the prior written consent of the Buyer, which shall not be unreasonably
withheld, delayed or conditioned.

(c) The Buyer shall control any Tax Claim in respect of (x) any Pre-
Closing Tax Period of the Company not covered by Section 6.4(b) and (y) any
Straddle Period; provided, however, that with respect to any such Tax Claim,
the Designated Representative shall have the right, directly or through its
designated representatives, to review in advance and comment upon all
submissions made in the course of such Tax Claim and otherwise participate in
such Tax Claim, and none of the Buyer or any of its Affiliates shall settle
or otherwise dispose of any such Tax Claim without obtaining the prior written
consent of the Designated Representative, which shall not be unreasonably
withheld, delayed or conditioned.

 

Section 6.5 _Transfer Taxes_. Transfer Taxes shall be borne 50 percent by
the Buyer and 50 percent by HoldCo. Any party required under applicable Law
to file any Tax Return or other document with respect to such Transfer Taxes
shall file such Tax Return (and the other parties shall cooperate with respect
thereto as necessary and shall reimburse the party filing such Tax Return
pursuant to this Section 6.5 for its share of such Transfer Taxes), and any
expenses related to such filing shall be borne in the same manner as the
applicable Transfer Taxes are borne pursuant to this Section 6.5.

Section 6.6 _Liability for Taxes_. HoldCo shall indemnify, defend and hold
harmless, the Buyer, the Company, and their Affiliates against any and all
Unitholder Taxes. The indemnification required hereunder for Unitholder Taxes
shall be made by prompt payment by HoldCo of the amount of such Taxes, as and
when the Designated Representative is notified of the amount of such Taxes by
the Buyer or the Company.

 



58 Section 6.7 _Tax Distributions_.

 

(a) On or before April 10, 2017:

 

(i) If the Estimated Tax Distribution Amount is positive, the Company shall
distribute to HoldCo an amount equal to the Estimated Tax Distribution Amount
in immediately available funds by wire transfer to an account or accounts
designated by HoldCo. Contemporaneously therewith, the Company shall deliver
to HoldCo a statement setting forth the Companys good faith estimate of the
Estimated Tax Distribution Amount, together with appropriate schedules and
supporting documentation setting forth in reasonable detail the calculations
contributing thereto.

 

(ii) If the Estimated Tax Distribution Amount is negative, HoldCo shall
promptly deliver to the Buyer an amount in cash equal to the absolute value
of such amount in immediately available funds by wire transfer to an account
or accounts designated by the Buyer, but not in excess of the Composite
Payment Amount.

 

(b) At least 15 Business Days prior to the Tax Distribution True-Up Date,
the Company shall deliver to HoldCo a statement setting forth the Companys
good faith estimate of the Tax Distribution Amount, together with appropriate

Distribution Amount shall be subject to the procedures set forth in Section
6.10.

 

(i) If the Estimated Tax Distribution Amount is in excess of the Tax
Distribution Amount, HoldCo shall promptly deliver to the Buyer an amount in
cash equal to such excess amount in immediately available funds by wire
transfer to an account or accounts designated by the Buyer, but not in excess
of the Estimated Tax Distribution plus the Composite Payment Amount.

(ii) If the Tax Distribution Amount is in excess of the Estimated Tax
Distribution Amount, the Buyer shall promptly deliver to HoldCo an amount in
cash equal to such excess amount in immediately available funds by wire
transfer to an account or accounts designated by HoldCo.

 

(iii) In the event that the Companys Taxable Income for the period
beginning September 1, 2016, and ending on the Closing Date, is subsequently
adjusted upon audit or the filing of an amended Tax Return, the Buyer shall
redetermine the Tax Distribution Amount, and the Buyer or HoldCo, as the case
may be, shall promptly deliver to the other party an amount in cash equal to
the difference, if any, between the redetermined Tax Distribution Amount and
the originally determined Tax Distribution Amount.

 

(c) The tax distribution payments referenced in paragraphs (a) and (b) of
this Section 6.7 shall not constitute Restricted Payments.

Section 6.8 _Intended Tax Treatment_. The Parties intend that the purchase and
sale of the Aggregate Units pursuant to this agreement be characterized as a
purchase and sale of the assets of the Company for U.S. federal, state and
local income tax purposes (the " _Intended Tax Treatment_ "), and no party
shall take a position on any Tax Return, before any Governmental Authority,
or in any judicial proceeding that is inconsistent with the Intended Tax
Treatment, except as required by applicable Law.

 



59 Section 6.9 _Purchase Price Allocation Among Assets_. As soon
as practical, but no later than sixty (60) days after the Closing Date, the
Buyer shall prepare an allocation of the Purchase Price among the assets of
the Company based on the fair market value of such assets immediately prior to
the Closing, consistent with section 1060 of the Code and the Treasury
Regulations promulgated thereunder (the " _Allocation_ "). The Buyer shall
forward a draft of the Allocation to the Designated Representative for the
Designated Representatives review and consent, which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned. The Allocation shall be binding
on the Buyer, the Company, HoldCo, the Unitholders, and their respective
Affiliates, for all purposes, including for Tax and financial accounting
purposes, and the parties shall report, act, and file Tax Returns (including
IRS Form 8594) in all respects and for all purposes consistent with the
Allocation, unless otherwise required by Law. No party (or their Affiliates)
shall take any position on any Tax Return, before any Governmental Authority,
or in any judicial proceeding that is inconsistent with the Allocation. If the
Buyer and the Designated Representative do not reach a written agreement as
to the Allocation prior to the 90th day after the Closing Date, then the
Allocation shall be determined under the procedures set forth in Section 6.10.

 

Section 6.10 _Dispute Resolution Procedure_. Disputes among the parties as
to matters governed by Article VI of this Agreement shall be resolved by a
firm of independent nationally recognized accountants chosen and mutually
accepted by the Buyer and the Designated Representative (the " _Independent
Accountant_ "), whose determination shall be final and binding on the
parties. The Independent Accountant shall resolve each dispute within 30 days
after the matter has been referred to it. The costs, fees and expenses of the
Independent Accountant shall be borne by the Buyer and HoldCo in inverse
proportion to the extent the position of such party (or its representatives)
prevails.

 

Section 6.11 _Responsibility of Unitholders for Tax Matters_. The
Unitholders shall cause HoldCo to take all actions required of HoldCo
pursuant to this Article VI, and Unitholders shall be jointly and severally
liable for the obligations of HoldCo pursuant to this Article VI.

Section 8.4 _Procedures_.

 

(a) A party seeking indemnification (the " _Indemnified Party_ ") in
respect of, arising out of or involving a Loss or a claim or demand made by
any person against the Indemnified Party (a " _Third Party Claim_ ") shall
deliver notice (a " _Claim Notice_ ") in respect thereof to the Designated
Representative, on behalf of the MBS Parties, or to the Buyer, as applicable
(the " _Indemnifying Party_ ") with reasonable promptness after receipt by
such Indemnified Party of notice of the Third Party Claim, and shall provide
the Indemnifying Party with such information with respect thereto as the
Indemnifying Party may reasonably request. The failure to deliver a Claim
Notice, however, shall not release the Indemnifying Party from any of its
obligations under this Article VIII except to the extent that the
Indemnifying Party is materially prejudiced by such failure.

(b) The Indemnifying Party shall have the right, upon written notice to
the Indemnified Party within 15 days of receipt of a Claim Notice from the
Indemnified Party in respect of such Third Party Claim, to assume the defense
thereof at the expense of the Indemnifying Party with counsel selected by the
Indemnifying Party and reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnified Party.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Indemnifying Party shall not be entitled to
assume the defense of any Third Party Claim for equitable or injunctive relief
or any claim that would impose criminal liability or damages, and the
Indemnified Party shall have the right to defend, at the expense of the
Indemnifying Party, any such Third Party Claim. The Indemnifying Party shall
be liable for the fees and expenses of counsel employed by the Indemnified
Party for any period during which the Indemnifying Party has failed to assume
the defense thereof. If the Indemnifying Party does not expressly elect to
assume the defense of 

 



65  such Third Party Claim within the time period and otherwise in accordance
with the first sentence of this Section 8.4(b), the Indemnified Party shall
have the sole right to assume the defense of and to settle such Third Party
Claim. If the Indemnifying Party assumes the defense of such Third Party
Claim, the Indemnified Party shall have the right to employ separate counsel
and to participate in the defense thereof, but the fees and expenses of such
counsel shall be at the expense of the Indemnified Party unless (i) the
employment of such counsel shall have been specifically authorized in writing
by the Indemnifying Party or (ii) the named parties to the Third Party
Claim (including any impleaded parties) include both the Indemnified Party
and the Indemnifying Party, and the Indemnified Party reasonably determines
that representation by counsel to the Indemnifying Party of both the
Indemnifying Party and such Indemnified Party presents such counsel with a
conflict of interest. If the Indemnifying Party assumes the defense of any
Third Party Claim, the Indemnified Party shall, at the Indemnifying Partys
expense, cooperate with the Indemnifying Party in such defense and make
available to the Indemnifying Party all witnesses, pertinent records,
materials and information in the Indemnified Partys possession or under the
Indemnified Partys control relating thereto as is reasonably required by the
Indemnifying Party. If the Indemnifying Party assumes the defense of any Third
Party Claim, the Indemnifying Party shall not, without the prior written
consent of the Indemnified Party, enter into any settlement or compromise
or consent to the entry of any judgment with respect to such Third Party
Claim if such settlement, compromise or judgment (i) involves a finding or
admission of wrongdoing, (ii) does not include an unconditional written
release by the claimant or plaintiff of the Indemnified Party from all
liability in respect of such Third Party Claim or (iii) imposes equitable
remedies or any obligation on the Indemnified Party other than solely the
payment of money damages for which the Indemnified Party will be indemnified
hereunder.

(c) An Indemnified Party seeking indemnification in respect of, arising
out of or involving a Loss or a claim or demand hereunder that does not
involve a Third Party Claim being asserted against or sought to be collected
from such Indemnified Party (a " _Direct Claim_ ") shall deliver a Claim
Notice in respect thereof to the Indemnifying Party with reasonable
promptness after becoming aware of facts supporting such Direct Claim, and
shall provide the Indemnifying Party with such information with respect
thereto as the Indemnifying Party may reasonably request. The failure to
deliver a Claim Notice, however, shall not release the Indemnifying Party from
any of its obligations under this Article VIII except to the extent that the
Indemnifying Party is materially prejudiced by such failure and shall not
relieve the Indemnifying Party from any other obligation or liability that it
may have to the Indemnified Party or otherwise than pursuant to this Article
VIII.

 

(d) The indemnification required under Section 8.2 shall be made by payment
by the Escrow Agent in accordance with the Escrow Agreement (to the extent of
any amounts then held in the Indemnity Escrow Fund if applicable) or the
Indemnifying Party (to the extent of any amounts not then held in the
Indemnity Escrow Fund if applicable) of the amount of actual Losses in
connection therewith, as and when bills are received by the Indemnifying Party
or Losses incurred have been notified to the Indemnifying Party.

 

Section 8.5 _Limits on Indemnification_. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary contained in this Agreement: (a) an Indemnifying Party shall not be
liable for any claim for indemnification pursuant to Section 8.2(a) or Section
8.3(a), as the case may be, unless and until

 



66  the aggregate amount of indemnifiable Losses which may be recovered from the
Indemnifying Party equals or exceeds $1,306,500, in which case the
Indemnifying Party shall be liable for the full amount of such Losses from
the first dollar thereof; and (b) (i) the maximum aggregate amount of
indemnifiable Losses which may be recovered by the Buyer and its Affiliates
from the MBS Parties arising out of or relating to the causes set forth in
Section 8.2(a) shall be an amount equal to (x) $17,420,000 (the " _General
Indemnity Cap_ _"_ ) _plus_ (y) the lesser of (I) the aggregate amount of
indemnifiable Losses arising out of or relating to the inaccuracy or breach
of any representation or warranty set forth in Section 3.21 (Privacy and
Security) and (II) $5,000,000, and (ii) the maximum aggregate amount of
indemnifiable Losses which may be recovered by the MBS Parties and their
Affiliates from the Buyer arising out of or relating to the causes set forth
in Section 8.3(a) shall be an amount equal to the General Indemnity Cap;
_provided_ , _however_ , that (A) the foregoing clauses (a) and (b) shall not
apply to indemnification for (1) Unitholder Taxes or (2) Losses arising out
of or relating to the inaccuracy or breach of any Fundamental Representation
or to any representation or warranty in the event of fraud; and (B) except
with respect to fraud, the maximum aggregate amount of indemnifiable Losses
which may be recovered from the Indemnifying Parties pursuant to Section 8.2
or Section 8.3, as the case may be, shall be an amount equal to the Base

Section 8.6 _Remedies Not Affected by Investigation, Disclosure or
Knowledge_. If the transactions contemplated hereby are consummated, the
Buyer expressly reserves the right to seek indemnity or other remedy for any
Losses arising out of or relating to any breach of any representation,
warranty or covenant contained herein, notwithstanding any investigation by,
disclosure to, knowledge or imputed knowledge of the Buyer or any of its
Representatives in respect of any fact or circumstance that reveals the
occurrence of any such breach, whether before or after the execution and
delivery hereof. In furtherance of the foregoing, the MBS Parties agree that
as knowledge or lack of reliance shall not be a defense in law or equity to
any claim of breach of representation, warranty or covenant by the MBS Parties
herein, the MBS Parties shall not in any proceeding concerning a breach or
alleged breach of any representation, warranty or covenant herein, or any
indemnity thereof, seek information concerning knowledge or reliance of the
Buyer or any of its Representatives, through deposition, discovery or
otherwise or seek to introduce evidence or argument in any proceeding
regarding the knowledge or lack of reliance of the Buyer or any of its
Representatives prior to the Closing on or with respect to any
such representations, warranties or covenants.

Section 8.7 _Tax Matters_. In the event of any conflict between the
provisions of this Article VIII and the provisions of Article VI, Article VI
shall be controlling with respect to any claim for indemnification for
Unitholder Taxes.

 

Section 8.8 _Payments_. With respect to any payments made pursuant to
ARTICLE VI or this Article VIII of this Agreement, the parties agree to
treat, to the extent permitted by Law, all such payments as an adjustment to
the Purchase Price paid hereunder.

 

Section 8.9 _Exclusive Remedies_. The parties acknowledge and agree that,
following the Closing, their sole and exclusive remedy with respect to any
and all claims for any breach or inaccuracy of any representation, warranty,
covenant, agreement or obligation set forth in this Agreement shall be
pursuant to the indemnification provisions set forth in Article VI and this
Article VIII. Notwithstanding the foregoing, this Section 8.9 shall not apply
in respect of the remedies of injunctive relief or specific performance set
forth in Section 10.11.

party so requesting termination (in the case of the Designated Representative

Designated Representative) to fulfill any obligation under this Agreement
shall have been the cause of, or shall have resulted in, the failure of such

(d) by either the Designated Representative or the Buyer if the Closing
shall not have occurred by July 31, 2017;  _provided_ , that the right to

that any Governmental Authority shall have issued an order, decree or ruling
or taken any other action restraining, enjoining or otherwise prohibiting the

other action shall have become final and nonappealable; _provided_ , that the
party so requesting termination shall have used its commercially reasonable
efforts, in accordance with Section 5.11 (Consents and Filings; Further
Assurances), to have such order, decree, ruling or other action vacated; or

unconditionally waives, and agrees not to assert, by way of motion or as a

Representative (in the case of an assignment by the Buyer), and any such
assignment without such prior written consent shall be null and void;
_provided_ ,  _however_ , that the Buyer may assign this Agreement or any

of any MBS Party (including for purposes of causing any Subsidiary of Buyer
designated by Buyer to be the transferee of the Aggregate Units at the

whatsoever arising prior to the Closing in their capacities as directors,

itself and for his, her or its heirs, executors, administrators and personal
representatives, and for any of their predecessors, successors and assigns,
hereby unconditionally and irrevocably waives any Actions, debts, dues, sums
of money, accounts, reckonings, bonds, bills, specialties, covenants,
contracts, controversies, agreements, promises, variances, trespasses,
damages, judgments, expenses, affirmative defenses, demands and other
obligations or liabilities whatsoever, in law or equity, that such MBS Party,
in his, her or its capacity as a stockholder, director, officer or employee
of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, and in each and every other
capacity, has against any other MBS Party or any Affiliate of any other MBS
Party and releases, on its own behalf and on behalf of its successors and
assigns, each other MBS Party and each Affiliate of each other MBS Party and
their respective directors, officers, trustees and beneficiaries from any and
all Actions relating thereto, except pursuant to this Agreement and the
Ancillary Agreements. The foregoing releases do not, and shall not be deemed
to, release or compromise rights to indemnification under any organizational
documents of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries.

this Agreement or any Ancillary Agreement refer to United States dollars,
which is the currency used for all purposes in this Agreement and any
Ancillary Agreement.

 

Section 10.14 _Severability_. Whenever possible, each provision or portion
of any provision of this Agreement shall be interpreted in such manner as to
be effective and valid

 



73  under applicable Law, but if any provision or portion of any provision of
this Agreement is held to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable in any respect
under any applicable Law or rule in any jurisdiction, such invalidity,
illegality or unenforceability shall not affect any other provision or portion
of any provision in such jurisdiction, and this Agreement shall be reformed,
construed and enforced in such jurisdiction as if such invalid, illegal or
unenforceable provision or portion of any provision had never been contained
herein.

 

Section 10.15 _Waiver of Jury Trial_. EACH OF THE PARTIES TO THIS
AGREEMENT HEREBY IRREVOCABLY WAIVES ALL RIGHT TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY
ACTION, PROCEEDING OR COUNTERCLAIM ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS
AGREEMENT, ANY FINANCING OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY.

 

Section 10.16 _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed in two or
more counterparts, all of which shall be considered one and the same
instrument and shall become effective when one or more counterparts have been
signed by each of the parties and delivered to the other parties.

executed by facsimile or .pdf signature and a facsimile or .pdf signature
shall constitute an original for all purposes.

Section 10.18 _No Presumption Against Drafting Party_. Each of the
parties hereto acknowledges that each party to this Agreement has been
represented by legal counsel in connection with this Agreement and the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Accordingly, any rule of law or
any legal decision that would require interpretation of any claimed
ambiguities in this Agreement against the drafting party has no application
and is expressly waived.

 

Section 10.19 _Financing Provisions_. For the avoidance of doubt,
notwithstanding anything herein or in the Commitment Letter to the contrary,
none of the MBS Parties or the Representative are third party beneficiaries of
the Commitment Letter and related documents and in no event shall the MBS
Parties or the Designated Representative be entitled to enforce or seek to
enforce specifically or to cause Buyer to enforce any of Buyers rights and
remedies against any financial institution providing commitments or
undertaking any other obligations (collectively, the " _Financing Sources_ ")
under the Commitment Letter or any related documentation at any time,
including with respect to Buyers obligation or right to cause the Debt
Financing to be funded in order to consummate the transactions contemplated
hereby. Notwithstanding the foregoing, (i) the Financing Sources are third
party beneficiaries of Section 8.5, Section 8.9, Section 10.8, and Section
10.9 of this Agreement and (ii) each of the parties hereto agrees that
it will not bring or support any action, cause of action, claim, crossclaim
or thirdparty claim of any kind or description, whether in law or in equity,
whether in contract or in tort or otherwise, against the Financing Sources in
any way relating to this Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement, including any dispute arising out of or relating in any way to
the Commitment Letter or the performance thereof, in any forum other than the
Supreme Court of the State of New York, County of New York, or, if under
applicable law exclusive jurisdiction is vested in the Federal courts, the
United States District Court for the

 



74  Southern District of New York (and appellate courts thereof). Nothing in
this Section 10.19 shall affect any claim by any of the MBS Parties against
the Buyer for breach of its obligations under this Agreement.
