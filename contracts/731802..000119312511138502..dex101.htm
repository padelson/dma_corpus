 GUARANTY OF ALGONQUIN POWER and UTILITIES      

_EXHIBIT 10.1_

 

GUARANTY

 

THIS GUARANTY (this " _Guaranty_ ") is made as of May 12, 2011, by Algonquin
Power and Utilities Corp., a corporation organized under the Laws of Canada
(the " _Guarantor_ "), in favor of Atmos Energy Corporation, a corporation
incorporated in the State of Texas and the Commonwealth of Virginia ("
_Seller_ "). Capitalized terms used but not defined herein have the meanings
given to such terms in the Asset Purchase Agreement (defined below).

 

1. _Guaranty_. To induce Seller to enter into that certain Asset Purchase Agreement, dated as of the date hereof, by and between Liberty Energy (Midstates) Corp., a Missouri corporation (" _Buyer_ "), and Seller (as amended, supplemented or otherwise modified from time to time, the " _Purchase Agreement_ "), and for other good and valuable consideration, Guarantor hereby absolutely, unconditionally and irrevocably guarantees to Seller the full and prompt payment, when due, of the Purchase Price (including any adjustment thereof, whenever due) and the full and prompt payment and performance of all other obligations of Buyer (and Buyers successors and permitted assigns under the Purchase Agreement) to Seller to be performed prior to or upon Closing under the Purchase Agreement (collectively, the " _Obligations_ "). All sums payable by Guarantor hereunder shall be paid in immediately available funds. 

 

2. _Nature of Guaranty_. This is an unconditional guaranty of payment and performance and not of collectibility, and a separate action or actions may be brought and prosecuted against Guarantor to enforce this Guaranty, irrespective of whether any action is brought against Buyer or whether Buyer is joined in any such action or actions. Seller shall not be obligated to file any claim relating to the Obligations in the event that Buyer becomes subject to a bankruptcy, reorganization or similar proceeding, and the failure of Seller to so file shall not affect Guarantors obligations hereunder. In the event that any payment by Buyer to Seller in satisfaction of any Obligation is rescinded or must otherwise be returned for any reason whatsoever, Guarantor shall remain liable hereunder with respect to such Obligation as if such payment had not been made. 

3. _Changes in Obligations; Certain Waivers_. 

(a) Guarantor agrees that Seller may at any time and from time to time,
without notice to or further consent of Guarantor, extend the time for payment
or performance of any of the Obligations, and may also make any agreement
with Buyer for the extension, renewal, payment, compromise, discharge or
release thereof, in whole or in part, or for any modification of the terms
thereof or of any agreement between Seller and Buyer without in any
way impairing or affecting Guarantors obligations under this Guaranty.
Guarantor agrees that the obligations of Guarantor hereunder shall not be
released, modified or discharged, in whole or in part, by: (i) the failure of
Seller to assert any claim or demand or to enforce any right or remedy
against Buyer, Guarantor, or others; (ii) any change in the time, place or
manner of payment or performance of any of the Obligations or any rescission,
waiver, compromise, consolidation or other amendment or modification of any
of the terms or provisions of the Purchase Agreement; (iii) the addition,
substitution or release of any Person interested in the transactions
contemplated by the Purchase Agreement; (iv) any change in the corporate
existence, structure or ownership of Buyer or of any other Person interested
in the transactions contemplated by the Purchase Agreement; (v) any voluntary
or involuntary insolvency, bankruptcy, reorganization, liquidation,   dissolution, receivership, marshaling of assets, assignment for the benefit
of creditors or other similar proceeding affecting Buyer or any other Person
interested in the transactions contemplated by the Purchase Agreement; (vi)
the existence of any claim, set-off or other right which Guarantor may have at
any time against Seller, whether in connection with the Obligations or
otherwise; (vii) the adequacy of any other means Seller may have of obtaining
payment or performance of the Obligations; (viii) the value, genuineness,
validity or enforceability of the Purchase Agreement or any other agreement or
instrument referred to herein or therein; or (ix) any other act or omission
that may in any manner or to any extent vary the risk of or to Guarantor or
otherwise operate as a discharge of Guarantor as a matter of Law or equity
(other than as a result of payment and performance of the Obligations in
accordance with their terms).

(b) To the fullest extent permitted by Law, Guarantor hereby expressly
waives any and all rights or defenses arising by reason of any Law which
would otherwise require any election of remedies by Seller. Guarantor hereby
waives promptness, diligence, notice of the acceptance of this Guaranty and of
the Obligations, presentment, demand for payment, notice of non-performance,
default, dishonor and protest, notice of any Obligations incurred and all
other notices of any kind (other than notices required to be given under the
Purchase Agreement), all defenses which may be available by virtue of any
valuation, stay, moratorium Law or other similar Law now or hereafter in
effect, any right to require the marshaling of assets of Buyer or any other
Person interested in the transactions contemplated by the Purchase Agreement,
all rights of subrogation, indemnification or contribution (whether arising by
contract or operation of law, including, without limitation, any such right
under bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization or similar laws
affecting creditors rights) arising prior to the satisfaction in full of the
Obligations and all suretyship defenses generally. Guarantor acknowledges that
it will receive substantial direct and indirect benefits from the transactions
contemplated by the Purchase Agreement and that the waivers set forth in this
Guaranty are knowingly made in contemplation of such benefits. Guarantor
hereby covenants and agrees that it shall not institute, and shall cause its
respective Affiliates not to institute, any proceedings asserting that this
Guaranty is illegal, invalid or unenforceable in accordance with its terms,
subject to (i) the effects of bankruptcy, insolvency, fraudulent conveyance,
reorganization, moratorium or other similar Laws affecting creditors rights
generally, and (ii) general equitable principles (whether considered in a
proceeding in equity or at Law).

4. _No Waiver; Cumulative Rights_. No failure on the part of Seller to exercise, and no delay in exercising, any right, remedy or power hereunder shall operate as a waiver thereof, nor shall any single or partial exercise by Seller of any right, remedy or power hereunder preclude any other or future exercise of any right, remedy or power hereunder. Each and every right, remedy and power hereby granted to Seller or allowed it by Law or other agreement shall be cumulative and not exclusive of any other, and may be exercised by Seller at any time or from time to time.
