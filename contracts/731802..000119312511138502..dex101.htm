<P STYLE="margin-top:12px;margin-bottom:0px; text-indent:4%"><FONT STYLE="font-family:Times New Roman" SIZE="2">THIS GUARANTY (this &#147;<U>Guaranty</U>&#148;) is made as of May&nbsp;12, 2011, by Algonquin Power&nbsp;&amp; Utilities Corp., a
corporation organized under the Laws of Canada (the &#147;<U>Guarantor</U>&#148;), in favor of Atmos Energy Corporation, a corporation incorporated in the State of Texas and the Commonwealth of Virginia (&#147;<U>Seller</U>&#148;). Capitalized terms
used but not defined herein have the meanings given to such terms in the Asset Purchase Agreement (defined below). </FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12px;margin-bottom:0px; text-indent:4%"><FONT STYLE="font-family:Times New Roman" SIZE="2">1.<U>Guaranty</U>. To induce Seller to enter into that certain Asset Purchase Agreement, dated as of the date hereof, by and between
Liberty Energy (Midstates) Corp., a Missouri corporation (&#147;<U>Buyer</U>&#148;), and Seller (as amended, supplemented or otherwise modified from time to time, the &#147;<U>Purchase Agreement</U>&#148;), and for other good and valuable
consideration, Guarantor hereby absolutely, unconditionally and irrevocably guarantees to Seller the full and prompt payment, when due, of the Purchase Price (including any adjustment thereof, whenever due) and the full and prompt payment and
performance of all other obligations of Buyer (and Buyer&#146;s successors and permitted assigns under the Purchase Agreement) to Seller to be performed prior to or upon Closing under the Purchase Agreement (collectively, the
&#147;<U>Obligations</U>&#148;). All sums payable by Guarantor hereunder shall be paid in immediately available funds. </FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12px;margin-bottom:0px; text-indent:4%"><FONT STYLE="font-family:Times New Roman" SIZE="2">2.<U>Nature of Guaranty</U>. This is an unconditional guaranty of payment and performance and not of collectibility, and a separate
action or actions may be brought and prosecuted against Guarantor to enforce this Guaranty, irrespective of whether any action is brought against Buyer or whether Buyer is joined in any such action or actions. Seller shall not be obligated to file
any claim relating to the Obligations in the event that Buyer becomes subject to a bankruptcy, reorganization or similar proceeding, and the failure of Seller to so file shall not affect Guarantor&#146;s obligations hereunder. In the event that any
payment by Buyer to Seller in satisfaction of any Obligation is rescinded or must otherwise be returned for any reason whatsoever, Guarantor shall remain liable hereunder with respect to such Obligation as if such payment had not been made.

STYLE="font-family:Times New Roman" SIZE="2">(a) Guarantor agrees that Seller may at any time and from time to time, without notice to or further consent of Guarantor, extend the time for payment or performance of any of the Obligations, and may
also make any agreement with Buyer for the extension, renewal, payment, compromise, discharge or release thereof, in whole or in part, or for any modification of the terms thereof or of any agreement between Seller and Buyer without in any way
impairing or affecting Guarantor&#146;s obligations under this Guaranty. Guarantor agrees that the obligations of Guarantor hereunder shall not be released, modified or discharged, in whole or in part, by: (i)&nbsp;the failure of Seller to assert
any claim or demand or to enforce any right or remedy against Buyer, Guarantor, or others; (ii)&nbsp;any change in the time, place or manner of payment or performance of any of the Obligations or any rescission, waiver, compromise, consolidation or
other amendment or modification of any of the terms or provisions of the Purchase Agreement; (iii)&nbsp;the addition, substitution or release of any Person interested in the transactions contemplated by the Purchase Agreement; (iv)&nbsp;any change
in the corporate existence, structure or ownership of Buyer or of any other Person interested in the transactions contemplated by the Purchase Agreement; (v)&nbsp;any voluntary or involuntary insolvency, bankruptcy, reorganization, liquidation,

contemplated by the Purchase Agreement; (vi)&nbsp;the existence of any claim, set-off or other right which Guarantor may have at any time against Seller, whether in connection with the Obligations or otherwise; (vii)&nbsp;the adequacy of any other
means Seller may have of obtaining payment or performance of the Obligations; (viii)&nbsp;the value, genuineness, validity or enforceability of the Purchase Agreement or any other agreement or instrument referred to herein or therein; or
(ix)&nbsp;any other act or omission that may in any manner or to any extent vary the risk of or to Guarantor or otherwise operate as a discharge of Guarantor as a matter of Law or equity (other than as a result of payment and performance of the

any and all rights or defenses arising by reason of any Law which would otherwise require any election of remedies by Seller. Guarantor hereby waives promptness, diligence, notice of the acceptance of this Guaranty and of the Obligations,
presentment, demand for payment, notice of non-performance, default, dishonor and protest, notice of any Obligations incurred and all other notices of any kind (other than notices required to be given under the Purchase Agreement), all defenses
which may be available by virtue of any valuation, stay, moratorium Law or other similar Law now or hereafter in effect, any right to require the marshaling of assets of Buyer or any other Person interested in the transactions contemplated by the

single or partial exercise by Seller of any right, remedy or power hereunder preclude any other or future exercise of any right, remedy or power hereunder. Each and every right, remedy and power hereby granted to Seller or allowed it by Law or other
agreement shall be cumulative and not exclusive of any other, and may be exercised by Seller at any time or from time to time. </FONT></P>
