Section 2.1 Purchase Price. In consideration of the sale, transfer,
assignment, conveyance and delivery of the Assets, the aggregate purchase
price payable by the Buyer at the Closing shall be an amount (the "Closing
Cash Amount") equal to: $167,500,000, plus (i) the amount, if any, by which
the purchase price for the acquisition of the Ground Lease Property by the
Sellers from the owners thereof, plus all reasonable out-of-pocket costs
incurred by the Sellers in connection therewith, exceeds $4,000,000, subject
to Section 8.1(g) below (the "Ground Lease Purchase Price Excess"), plus (ii)
an amount equal to (x) all unrefunded deposits and reasonable out-of-pocket
expenses and costs incurred by the Sellers in connection with the preparation

of-pocket expenses and costs incurred by the Sellers in connection with the
25th Street Project that are approved in writing by the Buyer in advance, in
each case, through the earlier of (A) the Closing Date or (B) the date on
which the 25th Street Project is terminated pursuant to Section 1.1(o) (the
"25th Street Project Expenses"). The Closing Cash Amount minus (i) the Final
Post‑Closing Reduction, if any, plus (ii) the Final Post-Closing Addition, if
any, is referred to in this Agreement as the "Purchase Price".



Section 2.2 Closing Consideration. At the Closing, the Closing Cash Amount
shall be paid by the Buyer as follows:

 (a)the Buyer shall deposit an amount equal to $5,000,000 (the "Escrow Amount")
with the Escrow Agent. Such funds plus all income accrued thereon (the "Escrow
Funds") shall be maintained by the Escrow Agent to secure the Sellers'
obligations under this Agreement and shall be administered and payable in
accordance with the terms of the Escrow Agreement;

(b)the Buyer shall pay to the applicable obligees of the Sellers, on behalf of
the Sellers and for the Sellers' account, the Debt Amount and Seller
Transaction Expenses outstanding as of the Closing; and

(c)the Buyer shall pay to the Sellers, by wire transfer of immediately
available funds to the account or accounts designated by the Sellers an amount
in cash equal to the Closing Cash Amount minus the sum of (i) the Escrow
Amount, (ii) the Debt Amount and (iii) the Seller Transaction Expenses
outstanding as of the Closing.

Section 2.3 Purchase Price Adjustments.



(a)As soon as practicable after the Closing Date but no later than the 60th
day after the Closing Date, the Buyer shall deliver to the Sellers a schedule
(the "Closing Schedule") of its calculation of (A) the book value of the
Current Assets as of the Effective Time (the "Closing Current Assets"), (B)
the book value of the Current Liabilities as of the Effective Time (the
"Closing Current Liabilities") and (C) the amount by which (i) the Closing
Current Liabilities exceed the Closing Current Assets (the "Post‑Closing
Reduction"), or (ii) the amount by which the Closing Current Assets exceed the
Closing Current Liabilities (the "Post-Closing Addition").

(b)Within 20 days after the Sellers' receipt of the Closing Schedule, the
Sellers may deliver written notice (the "Protest Notice") of their objections
to the Buyer's calculation of the Closing Current Assets, the Closing Current
Liabilities and the resulting Post-Closing Reduction or Post-Closing Addition,
as applicable, and the proposed modification of the Closing Schedule, together
with a written statement explaining in reasonable detail the reasons for the
objections and the basis for the proposed modification. Sellers shall have the
right to reasonable review and approve of the Closing Schedule and may object
on any basis made in good faith. If the Sellers do not deliver such notice of
objection within such 20-day period, then the Closing Schedule, and the
Buyer's calculation of the Closing Current Assets, Closing Current Liabilities
and the Post-Closing Reduction or Post-Closing Addition, as applicable, as
shown thereon, shall be final, conclusive and binding on the parties hereto.
Any amounts not disputed in the Protest Notice (if one is delivered) shall be
deemed to be accepted by the Sellers as final. Upon receipt of the Closing
Schedule, the Sellers and their respective accountants will be given
reasonable access to the relevant books, records, workpapers and personnel
during reasonable business hours for the purpose of verifying the Closing
Schedule.

(c)If the Buyer disagrees with all or any portion of the Sellers' proposed
modifications of the Closing Schedule, then the Buyer shall notify the Sellers
and the Buyer and the Sellers shall negotiate in good faith to reach an
agreement during the 20-day period immediately following delivery by the
Sellers of the Protest Notice. If the Buyer and the Sellers reach such an
agreement, such agreement shall be final, conclusive and binding on the
parties hereto.

(d)If, within the 20-day negotiation period described in Section 2.3(c), the
Buyer and the Sellers are unable to reach an agreement on the Closing
Schedule, they shall promptly thereafter cause the Independent Accountant to
review this Agreement and the disputed items or amounts for the purpose of
calculating the Closing Current Assets, Closing Current Liabilities and the
Post-Closing Reduction or Post-Closing Addition, as applicable. In making such
calculation,

 the Independent Accountant shall consider only those items or amounts in the
Closing Schedule as to which the Buyer and the Sellers have disagreed within
the allowable periods set forth herein. The determination by the Independent
Accountant of the disagreed amounts shall be based solely on presentations by
the Buyer and the Sellers, and shall not involve the Independent Accountant's
independent review. The Independent Accountant shall deliver to the Sellers
and the Buyer, as promptly as practicable, a report setting forth its
calculations. Any determination by the Independent Accountant shall not be
outside the range defined by the respective amounts in the Closing Schedule
proposed by the Buyer and the Sellers' proposed adjustments thereto (after
giving effect to any disputed items that were resolved by the Buyer and the
Sellers prior to submission to the Independent Accountant), and such
determination shall be final, conclusive, binding and non-appealable upon the
parties hereto. Each of the Buyer, on the one hand, and the Sellers, on the
other hand, shall bear that percentage of the fees and expenses of the
Independent Accountant equal to the proportion (expressed as a percentage) of
the dollar value of the disputed amounts determined in favor of the other
party by the Independent Accountant. For purposes of this Agreement, "Final
Post-Closing Reduction" means the amount by which (i) the Closing Current
Liabilities exceed the Closing Current Assets as finally determined pursuant
to this Section 2.3, and "Final Post-Closing Addition" means the amount by
which the Closing Current Assets exceed the Closing Current Liabilities, as
finally determined pursuant to this Section 2.3.

(e)Within five (5) Business Days following the determination of the Final
Post-Closing Reduction or the Final Post-Closing Addition, as applicable
pursuant to this Section 2.3:

(i) if the Purchase Price exceeds the Closing Cash Amount, the Buyer shall pay
to the Sellers, by wire transfer of immediately available funds to the account
or accounts designated by the Sellers, an amount in cash equal to the amount
of such excess; and

(ii) if the Purchase Price is less than the Closing Cash Amount, the Sellers
shall jointly and severally be responsible for and pay to the Buyer, by wire
transfer of immediately available funds to an account or accounts designated
by the Buyer, an amount in cash equal to the amount of such deficit. If any
amount is paid from the Escrow Amount to the Buyer with respect to any
obligations of the Sellers under this Section 2.3, the Sellers shall be
jointly and severally obligated to replenish the Escrow Amount by promptly
depositing additional funds in the amount of any such payment into the account
to be held and administered in accordance with the Escrow Agreement.

Section 2.4 Withholding Rights. The Buyer shall be entitled to deduct and
withhold from the consideration otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement
to the Sellers such amounts as it is required to deduct and withhold with
respect to such payment under the Code, or any provision of any applicable
Law. To the extent that amounts are so withheld by the Buyer, such withheld
amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been
paid to the Sellers in respect of which such deduction and withholding was
made by the Buyer.



Section 2.5 Purchase Price Allocation. The parties hereto agree to allocate
the Purchase Price (along with all other items of consideration for tax
purposes and including any adjustment thereto) among the Business Sellers and
PHR and among the Assets (i) that constitute Class IV assets and Class V
assets (each as defined in Section 1060 of the Code) in accordance with the
Independent Valuation and (ii) that constitute Class VI assets and Class VII
assets (each as defined in Section 1060 of the Code), if applicable, all in
accordance with the methodology set forth on Schedule 2.5. The foregoing

 clauses (i) and (ii) are referred to as the "Allocation Methodology". The
parties acknowledge and agree that none of the Assets shall constitute Class I
Assets, Class II Assets or Class III Assets (each as defined in Section 1060
of the Code). No later than 60 days following the completion of the Buyer's
purchase accounting valuation, the Buyer shall prepare an allocation of the
Purchase Price in accordance with the Allocation Methodology, which allocation
(as finally determined pursuant to this Section 2.5) shall be binding upon the
parties hereto. Any amendment to such allocation shall be prepared in
accordance with the procedures set forth in this Section 2.5 for the initial
allocation. The parties hereto shall report for Tax and other relevant
purposes (and shall defend in any Tax Proceeding) the Transactions in a manner
consistent with such allocation and any amendment thereto (including the
preparation of Internal Revenue Service Form 8594) and not take any position
inconsistent therewith. The Sellers shall timely deliver all such documents
and other information as the Buyer may reasonably request in order to prepare
such allocation or any amendment thereto. If the Sellers dispute an amount on
the allocation prepared by the Buyer (the only permissible basis for which
being that the allocation was not prepared in accordance with Schedule 2.5),
the Sellers shall deliver written notice to the Buyer specifying in reasonable
detail the amount in dispute and the basis for such dispute within 30 days
following the delivery of the allocation prepared by the Buyer to the Sellers.
Any dispute not resolved within 30 days following the Buyer's receipt of a
protest notice from the Sellers regarding the allocation prepared by the Buyer
pursuant to this Section 2.5 shall be resolved in accordance with the dispute
resolution procedures set forth in Section 2.3.

qualified to do business as a foreign company in all jurisdictions where the

which such Seller is or will be a party. The execution, delivery and
performance by such Seller of this Agreement and the Transaction Documents to
which such Seller is or will be a party and the consummation of the
Transactions by such Seller have been duly authorized by all necessary action
and, when executed and delivered, will constitute the legal, valid and binding
obligation of such Seller enforceable against such Seller in accordance with
their terms, subject to the Enforceability Exceptions. The name of each
director and officer of each Seller is set forth opposite the position held by
same on Schedule 3.1.

 (b)Each Business Seller has heretofore delivered to the Buyer correct and

ARTICLE VI

POST‑CLOSING COVENANTS OF PARTIES



Section 6.1 Tax Matters. The following provisions shall govern the allocation
of responsibility as between the Buyer and the Sellers for certain Tax matters
following Closing:



(a)After the Closing, the Sellers, on the one hand, and the Buyer, on the
other hand, (i) will promptly inform the other party in writing of any notice
that it or he receives of any Proceeding, request for documents or information
related to Taxes that could affect the Tax liability of the other party, (ii)
will each provide the other party, at the other party's reasonable expense,
with such assistance as may reasonably be requested in connection with the
preparation of any Tax Return, Proceeding or determination by any taxing
authority or judicial or administrative Proceeding relating to liability for
Taxes, (iii) will each retain and, at the other party's reasonable expense,
provide to the other party all records and other information that may be
relevant to any such Tax Return, Proceeding or determination and (iv) will
each provide the other party with any final determination

 of any such Tax Return, Proceeding or determination that affects any amount
required to be shown on any Tax Return of the other party for any period.
Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, each of the Sellers will
retain, until the expiration of the applicable statutes of limitation
(including any extensions thereof), copies of all Tax Returns, supporting work
schedules and other records relating to tax periods or portions thereof of
such Seller ending on or prior to the close of the Closing Date.

(b)For all purposes under this Agreement involving the determination of Taxes
(including the determination of Taxes that constitute Excluded Liabilities),
in the case of Taxes that are payable with respect to any period that includes
but does not end on the Closing Date, the portion of any such Tax that is
allocable to the portion of the period ending on the close of the Closing Date
shall be (i) in the case of Taxes that are (x) based upon or related to income
or receipts, (y) imposed in connection with the sale or other transfer or
assignment of property (real or personal, tangible or intangible) or (z)
employment, social security or other similar Taxes, deemed equal to the amount
which would be payable if the taxable year ended at the close of business on
the Closing Date; and (ii) in the case of Taxes imposed on a periodic basis
with respect to any assets or otherwise measured by the level of any item,
deemed to be the amount of such Taxes for the entire period (or, in the case
of such Taxes determined on an arrears basis, the amount of such Taxes for the
immediately preceding period) multiplied by a fraction the numerator of which
is the number of calendar days in the period ending at the close of business
on the Closing Date and the denominator of which is the number of calendar
days in the entire period. The Buyer and the Sellers agree to utilize the
alternate procedure set forth in Revenue Procedure 2004-53 with respect to
wage reporting.

(c)Any documentary, stamp, transfer, sales, use, registration and other such
Taxes and any conveyance fees, recording charges and other fees and charges
(collectively, "Transfer Taxes") shall be equally borne by the Sellers and
Buyer. The Sellers shall pay all Transfer Taxes to the applicable Governmental
Entity when due, and the Sellers shall file all necessary Tax Returns and
other documentation with respect to all such transfer, documentary, sales,
use, stamp, registration and other Taxes and fees, and if required by
applicable Law, the Buyer shall, and shall cause its Affiliates to, join in
the execution of any such Tax Returns and other documentation.

Section 6.2 Further Cooperation. The Buyer and the Sellers shall cooperate
with each other (i) in determining whether (x) any action must be taken by or
in respect of, or any filing must be made with, any Governmental Entity or (y)
any actions, consents, approvals or waivers are required to be obtained under
any Contracts or Licenses and Permits, in each case in connection with the
consummation of the Transactions; and (ii) in taking such actions or making
any such filings, in furnishing information required in connection therewith
and in seeking timely to obtain any such actions, consents, approvals or
waivers. Each of the parties hereto agrees that from and after the Closing
Date, upon the reasonable request of any other party hereto from time to time,
it or he shall execute and deliver, or cause to be executed and delivered,
such further instruments and take such other actions as may be necessary or
desirable to carry out the Transactions or to vest, perfect or confirm
ownership of the Assets in the Buyer.



Section 6.3 Accounts Receivable.



(a)All payments and reimbursements made by any Person in the name of or to any
Seller in connection with or arising out of the Assets and Assumed Liabilities
after the Closing Date, shall be held by such Seller in trust for the benefit
of the Buyer and, promptly, and in any event within two Business Days, after
receipt by such Seller of any such payment or reimbursement, the

 Sellers shall pay over to the Buyer the amount of such payment or
reimbursement without right of set off, together with all corresponding notes,
documentation and information received in connection therewith. After the
Closing, each Seller hereby irrevocably constitutes and appoints the Buyer as
its true and lawful attorney-in-fact and agent with full power of substitution
to cash and collect any checks or other instruments issued in the name of or
to such Seller with respect to any such payments or reimbursements.

(b)All payments and reimbursements made by any Person in the name of or to the
Buyer in connection with or arising out of the Excluded Assets and Excluded
Liabilities after the Closing Date, shall be held by the Buyer in trust for
the benefit of the applicable Seller and, promptly, and in any event within
two Business Days, after receipt by the Buyer of any such payment or
reimbursement, the Buyer shall pay over to the applicable Seller the amount of
such payment or reimbursement without right of set off, together with all
corresponding notes, documentation and information received in connection
therewith.

Section 6.4 Payment of Liabilities.



(a)After the Closing, the Sellers agree to pay in full and discharge all of
the Excluded Liabilities (other than those Excluded Liabilities contested by
Seller in good faith) in accordance with their stated terms, as applicable,
and in a manner that is not detrimental to any relationships of the Buyer or
the Business with employees, customers, suppliers, lessors or others.

(b)After the Closing, the Buyer agrees to pay in full and discharge all of the
Assumed Liabilities in accordance with their stated terms (other than those
Assumed Liabilities contested by the Buyer in good faith). To the extent
payment of 25th Street Project Expenses are not made at Closing (due to lack
of current invoices at Closing or otherwise), the Buyer agrees to promptly,
and in any event within two Business Days, after receipt by the Buyer of
evidence of such unpaid 25th Street Project Expenses, pay over to the
applicable Seller the amount of 25th Street Project Expenses.

Section 6.5 Post-Closing Operations. From and after the Closing Date, (a) each
Business Seller agrees to not, and will cause any of its or his Affiliates to
not, directly or indirectly, adopt any name that is confusingly similar to, or
a derivation of, its current legal name and (b) each Business Seller agrees
that it will as promptly as practicable, but in any event not more than 10
days after the Closing Date, amend its organizational documents to change its
name to a name that is not confusingly similar to, or a derivation of, its
current legal name and file such amendments with the Secretary of State of the
state of its formation and terminate or withdraw its qualification to do
business, in each jurisdiction where it is currently qualified to business.
The Sellers will refer to the Buyer all inquiries relating to the Business or
the Assets.



Section 6.6 Non-Assignable Rights. This Agreement shall not be deemed to
constitute an assignment, an attempted assignment or an undertaking to assign
any Assumed Contract or any claim, right or benefit arising thereunder or
resulting therefrom if consent to such assignment is not obtained and without
such consent such an assignment, attempted assignment or undertaking otherwise
would constitute a breach thereof or cause a loss of benefits thereunder. In
the event that any such consent is not obtained on or prior to the Closing
Date and the Buyer waives its right to delivery thereof under Section 7.2,
each Seller shall continue to use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain
such consents, shall hold such rights in trust for the benefit of the Buyer or
otherwise for the exclusive use and benefit of the Buyer and shall cooperate
with the Buyer in any arrangement designed to provide

 the Buyer with the rights and benefits (subject to the obligations) under any
such rights, including exercising such rights upon the Buyer's request and
promptly remitting any amounts received pursuant thereto to the Buyer.



Section 6.7 Employee Matters. As of the Closing, each Seller shall terminate
the employment of all employees of such Seller (the "Pre-Closing Employees")
and shall be solely responsible for satisfying any Liabilities that such
Seller may have to the Pre-Closing Employees (other than those included as
Current Liabilities) (the "Non Assumed Pre-Closing Employee Liabilities"). The
Buyer shall, subject to the Buyer's receipt of background checks satisfactory
to the Buyer using the standard practices for the employees of the Buyer,
offer employment as of the Closing to certain Pre-Closing Employees and such
offers of employment shall be on terms and conditions and with such benefits
as the Buyer shall determine (the "Transferred Employees"), and the Sellers
shall assist the Buyer in its efforts to hire such employees, including by
providing the Buyer with access to such employees and the personnel records of
such employees, encouraging such employees to accept offers of employment from
the Buyer and not taking any action which would reasonably be expected to
impede, hinder, interfere or otherwise compete with the Buyer's efforts to
hire such employees. The Buyer shall deliver to the Sellers a list of those
Pre-Closing Employees on or prior to the date of this Agreement. The Sellers
shall be responsible for providing notices and continuation of coverage that
is or may be required to be provided to each individual who is or becomes an
"MandA Qualified Beneficiary", as defined in Treasury Regulation Section
54.4980B-9, in connection with the consummation of the Transactions. Nothing
herein express or implied shall be deemed to require the Buyer to employ any
such person for any period of time or on any particular terms and conditions.
The Buyer and the Sellers hereby acknowledge and agree that all provisions
contained in this Section 6.7 are included for the sole benefit of the Buyer
and the Sellers and that nothing in this Section 6.7, whether express or
implied, shall create any third party beneficiary or other rights in any other
Person.



Section 6.8 Completion of Beachwoods Renovation. The currently pending
renovation of the 84 units and amenities at the Beachwoods Resort shall be
completed in accordance with the Beachwoods Plans and Budget; provided,
however, if the pending renovation is not completed at or prior to Closing,
the Sellers shall be jointly and severally responsible for all costs related
to such pending renovation following the Closing; provided, however, that the
Sellers shall not be responsible for any such costs incurred after the Closing
that are not set forth in the Beachwoods Plans and Budget.



Section 6.9 Non-Interference with Resort-Related Agreements. The Buyer shall
(and shall cause its Affiliates and their employees to, and use their
commercially reasonable efforts to cause the Timeshare Owners' Associations
to)(a) comply with their respective obligations under the Resort-Related
Agreements, and (b) not take any action, whether in their capacity as owner,
manager, or otherwise, which would reasonably be expected to impede, hinder or
otherwise interfere or with the Sellers' contractual relationships pursuant to
the Resort-Related Agreements. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in no event
shall the Buyer have any obligation to fund, satisfy or discharge any
obligation of any Timeshare Owners' Associations to the Sellers under any
Resort-Related Agreement.

Section 9.4 Rules Regarding Indemnification. The obligations and liabilities
of each party which may be subject to indemnification liability hereunder (the
"Indemnifying Party") to the other party (the "Indemnified Party") shall be
subject to the following terms and conditions:



(a)Third-Party Claims. The Indemnified Party shall give prompt written notice
to the Indemnifying Party of any claim by a third party (a "Third Party
Claim") which, if adversely determined, would entitle the Indemnified Party to
indemnity pursuant to this Article IX, stating the nature of said claim and
the amount thereof, to the extent known; provided, however, that the failure
to provide such prompt written notice shall in no event impair the rights of
the Indemnified Party or limit the obligations of the Indemnifying Party
except to the extent that such failure prejudices the Indemnifying Party's
ability to defend the claim. The Indemnified Party shall give notice

 (including copies of any writings received) to the Indemnifying Party that
pursuant to the indemnity, the Indemnified Party is asserting against the
Indemnifying Party a claim with respect to a potential Loss from the third
party claim, and such notice shall constitute the assertion of a claim for
indemnity by the Indemnified Party. So long as the Indemnifying Party provides
notice to the Indemnified Party within 30 days after receiving notice of such
Third Party Claim, the Indemnifying Party shall have the right to assume the
defense at its expense so long as a condition precedent to the Indemnifying
Party's right to assume control of such defense, the Indemnifying Party must
first furnish the Indemnified Party with reasonable evidence that the
Indemnifying Party is and will be able to satisfy any such Liability; and
provided, however, that the Indemnifying Party shall not have the right to
assume control of such defense or to select counsel if the Third Party Claim
which the Indemnifying Party seeks to assume control of (A) seeks non-monetary
relief; (B) involves criminal allegations; or (C) involves matters that the
Buyer reasonably believes, if determined adversely, would have a material
adverse effect on the business of the Buyer or any of its Affiliates or the
assets of the Buyer or any of its Affiliates. An Indemnifying Party's delivery
of a notice assuming the defense of a Third Party Claim shall constitute an
acceptance of its obligation hereunder to indemnify the Indemnified Party with
respect to any Losses, if any, resulting from the subject Third Party Claim.
So long as such defense is being conducted, the Indemnified Party shall not
settle or admit liability with respect to the claim and shall afford to the
Indemnifying Party and defending counsel reasonable assistance in defending
against the claim. If the Indemnifying Party assumes the defense as permitted
hereby, counsel shall be selected by such party and if the Indemnified Party
then retains its own counsel (which shall be reasonably acceptable to the
Indemnifying Party), it shall do so at its own expense. If the Indemnifying
Party does not assume the defense as permitted hereby or is not permitted to
assume the defense, the Indemnifying Party may participate in (but not
control) the defense of such Third Party Claim at its own expense.

(b)The Indemnifying Party agrees that it will not, without the prior written
consent of the Indemnified Party, settle, compromise or consent to the entry
of any judgment in any pending or threatened Third Party Claim relating to the
matters contemplated hereby unless such settlement, compromise or consent
includes an unconditional release of each Indemnified Party from all liability
arising or that may arise out of such Third Party Claim, the Indemnifying
Party admits in writing its liability to hold the Indemnified Party harmless
from and against any Losses arising out of such settlement and concurrently
with such settlement the Indemnifying Party pays the full amount of all Losses
to be paid by the Indemnifying Party in connection with such settlement.

Section 9.5 Payment. Payments of all amounts owing by an Indemnifying Party
under this Article IX shall be made promptly upon a final settlement among the
Indemnifying Party and the Indemnified Party or upon a final adjudication
determined by a court of competent jurisdiction in accordance with this
Article IX that an obligation is owing by the Indemnifying Party to the
Indemnified Party. Any payment that is not made within 10 days of the
determination that such obligation is owing shall bear interest at a rate of
eight percent (8%) per annum, or, if less, the maximum rate permitted by
applicable Laws. In addition, the Indemnifying Party shall reimburse the
Indemnified Party for any and all actual and reasonable costs or expenses of
any nature or kind whatsoever (including reasonable attorneys' fees) incurred
as the prevailing party in seeking to collect payment under this Article IX,
and no limitation in Section 9.3(b)-(e) of this Article IX shall apply to such
reimbursement or to any interest paid or to be paid pursuant to this Section
9.5.



Section 9.6 Materiality Qualifiers. For purposes of determining the amount of
Losses arising from such a breach for which the Buyer Indemnified Parties or
Seller Indemnified Parties are entitled to indemnification under Section
9.1(a) or Section 9.2(a), the representations and warranties

 made by the parties hereto in this Agreement or any other Transaction Document
shall be construed as if any qualification or limitation that is based on
materiality (including, without limitation, all usages of "material",
"Material Adverse Effect" or similar qualifiers) were omitted from the text of
such representation, warranty or covenant.



Section 9.7 Purchase Price Adjustment. Any indemnification received under this
Article IX shall be treated by the Buyer, the Sellers and their respective
Affiliates, to the extent permitted by Laws, as an adjustment to the Purchase
Price unless a Final Determination (defined below) causes any such amount not
to constitute an adjustment to the Purchase Price for federal tax purposes.
The term "Final Determination" shall mean (i) any final determination of
liability in respect of a Tax that, under applicable Laws, is not subject to
further appeal, review or modification through Proceedings or otherwise
(including the expiration of a statute of limitations or a period for the
filing of claims for refunds, amended returns or appeals from adverse
determinations) or (ii) the payment of Tax by the Buyer or the Sellers,
whichever is responsible for payment of such Tax under applicable Law, with
respect to any item disallowed or adjusted by a taxing authority, provided
that such responsible party or parties determine(s) that no action is required
to be taken to recoup such payment and the other party agrees in writing.

Section 11.5 Controlling Law. This Agreement shall be construed, interpreted
and enforced in accordance with the laws of the State of Delaware, without
reference to its choice of law provisions which would apply to the laws of
another state.



Section 11.6 WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL. EACH OF THE PARTIES HERETO HEREBY
IRREVOCABLY WAIVES ANY AND ALL RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY OF ANY CLAIM OR CAUSE OF
ACTION IN ANY LEGAL PROCEEDING ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO THIS AGREEMENT OR
THE TRANSACTIONS OR ANY COURSE OF CONDUCT, COURSE OF DEALING, STATEMENTS
(WHETHER VERBAL OR WRITTEN) OR ACTIONS OF ANY PARTY HERETO. THE PARTIES HERETO
EACH AGREE THAT ANY AND ALL SUCH CLAIMS AND CAUSES OF ACTION SHALL BE TRIED BY
THE COURT WITHOUT A JURY. EACH OF THE PARTIES HERETO FURTHER WAIVES ANY RIGHT
TO SEEK TO CONSOLIDATE ANY SUCH LEGAL PROCEEDING IN WHICH A JURY TRIAL HAS
BEEN WAIVED WITH ANY OTHER LEGAL PROCEEDING IN WHICH A JURY TRIAL CANNOT OR
HAS NOT BEEN WAIVED.



Section 11.7 Venue; Submission to Jurisdiction.



(a) Except as for all disputes, claims, or controversies arising out of
Section 2.3 or Section 2.5 (which disputes, claims, or controversies shall be
resolved exclusively as set forth in Section 2.3 and Section 2.5), all
disputes, claims, or controversies arising out of or relating to this
Agreement or any of the other Transaction Documents or the Transactions or the
negotiation, validity or performance hereof or thereof that are not resolved
by mutual agreement shall only be brought exclusively in the Court of Chancery
of the State of Delaware (including the appropriate appellate courts
therefrom), or in the event (but only in the event) that such court has no
jurisdiction over such disputes, claims, or controversies, any federal court
of the United States located in the State of Delaware (including the
appropriate appellate courts therefrom). Each of the parties hereto
irrevocably and unconditionally consents to the exclusive jurisdiction of such
courts to resolve all such disputes, claims or controversies and further
consents to the jurisdiction of such courts for the purposes of enforcing the
provisions of Sections 2.3 and 2.5. The parties hereto agree that a judgment
in any such dispute may be enforced in other jurisdictions by Proceedings on
the judgment or in any other manner provided by Law.

(b) Each party hereto further irrevocably waives any objection to any
proceeding before such courts based upon lack of personal jurisdiction or to
the laying of venue in such courts and further irrevocably and unconditionally
waives and agrees not to make a claim in any court that any proceeding before
such courts has been brought in an inconvenient forum. Each of the parties
hereto hereby consents to service of process by registered mail at the address
to which notices are to be given hereunder. Each of the parties hereto hereby
agrees that its submission to jurisdiction and its consent to service of
process by mail are made for the express benefit of the other parties hereto.
The parties agree and intend that the pendency of a proceeding pursuant to
Sections

 2.3 or 2.5 of this Agreement shall not preclude the ability of any party to
bring an action under this Section 11.7 with respect to any dispute or
controversy to which this Section 11.7 applies.

Section 11.8 Headings. Any table of contents and paragraph headings in this
Agreement are for convenience of reference only and shall not be considered or
referred to in resolving questions of interpretation.



Section 11.9 Partial Invalidity. The invalidity or unenforceability of any
particular provision of this Agreement shall not affect the other provisions
hereof, and if the rights or obligations of any party hereto under this
Agreement will not be materially and adversely affected thereby, (a) this
Agreement shall be construed in all respects as if such invalid or
unenforceable provisions were omitted, (b) the remaining provisions of this
Agreement will remain in full force and effect and will not be affected by
such invalid or unenforceable provision and (c) there shall be automatically
substituted for such invalid or unenforceable provision a provision as similar
as possible which is valid and enforceable.



Section 11.10 Waiver. Neither the failure nor any delay on the part of any
party hereto in exercising any rights, power or remedy hereunder shall operate
as a waiver thereof, or of any other right, power or remedy; nor shall any
single or partial exercise of any right, power or remedy preclude any further
or other exercise thereof, or the exercise of any other right, power or
remedy. No waiver of any of the provisions of this Agreement shall be void
unless it is in writing and signed by the party against which it is sought to
be enforced.



Section 11.11 Counterparts; Electronic Delivery. This Agreement may be
executed simultaneously in two or more counterparts, each of which shall be
deemed an original and all of which together shall constitute but one and the
same instrument. This Agreement and any amendments hereto, to the extent
signed and delivered by means of a facsimile machine or other electronic
transmission (including .pdf files), shall be treated in all manner and
respects and for all purposes as an original agreement or instrument.



Section 11.12 Interpretation. (a) All references to "dollars" or "$" shall be
to U.S. dollars. Unless the context otherwise requires, (b) all references to
Articles, Sections, Schedules or Exhibits are to Articles, Sections, Schedules
or Exhibits contained in or attached to this Agreement, (c) each accounting
term not otherwise defined in this Agreement has the meaning assigned to it in
accordance with GAAP, (d) words in the singular or plural include the singular
and plural and pronouns stated in either the masculine, the feminine or neuter
gender shall include the masculine, feminine and neuter, (e) the use of the
word "including" in this Agreement shall be by way of example rather than
limitation and (f) the word "extent" in the phrase "to the extent" shall mean
the degree to which a subject or other thing extends, and such phrase shall
not simply mean "if". The Disclosure Schedules are integral parts of this
Agreement and are incorporated herein and expressly made a part of this
Agreement as though completely set forth herein. Nothing in a Disclosure
Schedule shall be deemed adequate to disclose an exception to a representation
or warranty made herein, unless such Disclosure Schedule identifies the
exception with reasonable particularity and describes the relevant facts in
reasonable detail, including by express cross-reference to another Disclosure
Schedule. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the mere listing,
or inclusion of a copy, of a document or other item shall not be deemed
adequate to disclose an exception to a representation or warranty made herein,
unless the representation or warranty is being made as to the existence of the
document or other item itself. Further, it is acknowledged by the parties that
this Agreement has undergone several drafts with the negotiated suggestions of
both; and, therefore, no presumptions shall arise favoring either party by
virtue of the authorship of any of its provisions or the changes made through
revisions. The use of the phrases

 "furnished", "made available" or "provided to" when referring to information
and materials provided to the Buyer shall be deemed satisfied solely to the
extent such information and materials were uploaded to (and made accessible to
the Buyer and its representatives) the Gold Key Dataroom on or before the
second Business Day immediately preceding the date of this Agreement.



Section 11.3 Entire Agreement; Amendment. This Agreement, including the
Exhibits and Schedules hereto, constitutes the entire agreement between the
parties hereto with regard to the matters contained herein and it is
understood and agreed that all previous undertakings, negotiations, letter of
intent and agreements between the parties are merged herein. The Buyer
acknowledges that they have relied on no representation or warranty, written
or oral, other than as explicitly set forth in this Agreement, and the
schedules attached hereto. This Agreement may only be modified or amended by
an agreement in writing signed by the Buyer and the Sellers.



Section 11.14 Specific Performance. The parties hereto hereby agree that
irreparable damage would occur in the event that any provision of this
Agreement were not performed in accordance with its specific terms or was
otherwise breached, and that money damages or other legal remedies would not
be an adequate remedy for any such damages. Accordingly, the parties hereto
acknowledge and hereby agree that in the event of any breach or threatened
breach by the Buyer, on the one hand, or any Seller, on the other hand, of any
of the their respective covenants or obligations set forth in this Agreement,
the Buyer, on the one hand, and the Sellers, on the other hand, shall be
entitled to an injunction or injunctions to prevent or restrain breaches or
threatened breaches of this Agreement, by the other(s) (as applicable), and to
specifically enforce the terms and provisions of this Agreement to prevent
breaches or threatened breaches of, or to enforce compliance with, the
covenants and obligations of the other under this Agreement (without posting
any bond or other security). Notwithstanding the foregoing, it is explicitly
agreed that the right of the Sellers to seek an injunction, specific
performance or other equitable remedies in connection with enforcing the
Buyer's obligation to pay the Purchase Price and to consummate the Closing
shall be subject to the requirements that (i) the conditions to the Closing
set forth in Section 7.4 and Section 7.6 have been satisfied, (ii) the Buyer
fails to pay, on the third Business Day following the satisfaction or waiver
of such conditions, the amounts required to be paid by the Buyer pursuant to
Section 2.2 and (iii) the Sellers have irrevocably confirmed to the Buyer in
writing that, if the amounts required to be paid pursuant to Section 2.2 are
paid in accordance therewith, the Sellers are ready, willing and able to
consummate the Closing. The Buyer and each Seller hereby expressly waive any
objections to the availability of specific performance as a remedy available
to any party. Any and all remedies herein expressly conferred hereby upon a
party will be deemed cumulative with and not exclusive of any other remedy
conferred hereby, or by law or equity upon such party (including the right to
sue for damages), and the exercise by a party of any one remedy will not
preclude the exercise of any other remedy in accordance with this Agreement.
Each party hereby waives any provision of Law to the extent that such
provision would limit or restrict the agreement contained in this Section
11.14.



Section 11.15 Waiver of Bulk Sales Laws. The parties hereto hereby waive
compliance in connection with the Transactions with the provisions of Article
6 of the Uniform Commercial Code as adopted in states where any of the Assets
are located, and any other applicable bulk sales laws, in effect as of the
date of the Closing.
