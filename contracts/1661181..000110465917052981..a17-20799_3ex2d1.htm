exchanged for the right to receive:

 



      
 

 



 

(A) an amount in cash equal to the Per Share Merger Value;

 



 

(B) an amount in cash equal to the product of (1) $10.00 and (2) a number of

in _Sections 2.8_ and _2.9_ ; provided, that in the event the holder of

prior to the First Merger Effective Time shall be amended so that such Company
Series B Warrant shall entitle the holder thereof (if such Company Series B
Warrant becomes exercisable), when exercised, to receive for each share of
Company Common Stock subject to such Company Series B Warrant, the Per Share
Total Cash Consideration or the Per Share Total Stock Consideration (in each
case, net of the exercise price).

applicable exercise price or base price per share of Company Common Stock
underlying such Company Option or Company SAR.

 



 

(B) an amount in cash equal to the product of (1) $10.00 and (2) a number of
shares of Parent Common Stock equal to the quotient obtained by dividing (x)
3,875,000 by (y) the Fully Diluted Share Number (collectively, (A) and (B) the
" _Per SAR/Option Cash Consideration_ ");

 



 

(C) a number of New Parent Warrants equal to the quotient obtained by dividing
(x) 4,100,000 by (y) the Fully Diluted Share Number; and

 



 

(D) such holders Pro Rata Share of certain payments under the Tax Receivables
Agreement, subject to the terms and conditions set forth therein; _provided_
that, the holder shall not be entitled to receive such payments made later

(B) a number of shares of Parent Common Stock equal to the quotient obtained

Agreement, subject to the terms and conditions set forth therein; _provided_
that, the holder shall not be entitled to receive such payments made later
than the fifth anniversary of the Closing Date

 



      
 

 



 

(collectively, (A) through (D), the " _Per SAR/Option Total Stock
Consideration_ ")

 



 

(e) _Conversion of Merger Sub Common Stock_. At the First Merger Effective
Time, by virtue of the First Merger and without any action on the part of any
party or the holder of any of their securities, each issued and outstanding
share of common stock of Merger Sub shall be converted into one (1) validly
issued fully paid and nonassessable share of common stock of the Surviving
Corporation and all such shares together shall constitute the only outstanding
shares of capital stock of the Surviving Corporation.

 



 

(f) _Payment of Merger Consideration_.

 



 

(i) As soon as reasonably practicable after the date of this Agreement, Parent
and the Company shall at Parents expense, jointly appoint and engage, an
agent reasonably acceptable to the Company (the " _Exchange Agent_ ") for the
purpose of, among other things, receiving elections and the exchanges and
payments described in _this Article II_.

 



 

(ii) Parent, Merger Sub and NewCo shall enter into an exchange agent agreement
with the Exchange Agent, which agreement shall set forth the duties,
responsibilities and obligations of the Exchange Agent consistent with the
terms of this Agreement, including with regard to the exchanges described in
this _Section 2.1(f)_.

 



 

(iii) Any portion of the Exchange Fund (including the proceeds of any
investments of the Exchange Fund) that remains unclaimed by the stockholders
of the Company for one hundred eighty (180) days after the First Merger
Effective Time shall be delivered to Parent. Any Company Holder who has not
theretofore complied with this _Article II_ shall thereafter look only to
Parent for delivery of such holders Merger Consideration, as applicable, upon
due surrender of their book entry interests (or affidavits of loss in lieu as
set forth below), in each case, without any interest thereon. Notwithstanding
the foregoing, neither the Exchange Agent nor any party hereto shall be liable
to any Person in respect of the consideration payable pursuant to this
Agreement delivered to a public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned
property, escheat or similar Law.

 



 

(iv) The amounts payable in respect of Company SARs pursuant to this Agreement
shall be made by the Company to the applicable holders thereof through the
Companys payroll system (or other system as the Company elects) as soon as
reasonably practicable following the Effective Time or, in the case of
payments under the Tax Receivables Agreement, as soon as reasonably
practicable after such payment becomes payable thereunder. The amounts payable
to each Company Holder as described in _Section 2.1(d)_ shall be reduced by
the value of any income or employment Tax and social security or National
Insurance contributions withholding amounts required to be withheld under the
Code or any provision of state, local or foreign Tax law in respect thereof
and shall, for the avoidance of doubt, take into account the value of any
cash, shares of Parent Common Stock and New Parent Warrants delivered to such
Company Holder for purposes of determining the withholding required with
respect to such Company Holders.

 



      
 

 



 

To the extent that amounts are withheld pursuant to the preceding sentence and
timely paid to the applicable Government Entity, such withheld amounts shall
be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the
applicable Company Holders. Any Company Holder resident for Tax in the United
Kingdom receiving Parent Common Stock shall, unless otherwise dictated in
writing by the Parent, be required to enter into an election pursuant to
section 431(1) of the Income Tax (Earnings and Pensions) Act 2003 (" _Section
431 Election_") in respect of the Parent Common Stock.

 



 

(g) _Fractional Shares_. Notwithstanding any other provision hereof, no
fractional shares or warrants and no certificates or scrip therefor, or other
evidence of ownership thereof, will be issued in the First Merger. Any holder
of Company Common Stock, Company Warrants, Company Options or Company SARs
entitled to receive a fractional share of Parent Common Stock or New Parent
Warrant but for this _Section 2.1(g)_ shall be entitled to receive a cash
payment in lieu thereof, which payment shall be calculated (i) with respect to
Company Common Stock, Company Warrants and Company Options, by the Exchange
Agent and shall represent such holders proportionate interest in the net
proceeds from the sale by the Exchange Agent on behalf of all such holders, of
the aggregate fractional shares of Parent Common Stock or New Parent Warrants
that such holders otherwise would be entitled to receive and (ii) with respect
to Company SARs, by the Company and such fractional amount shall be calculated
based on the average closing price of Parent Common Stock and New Parent
Warrants, as applicable, on the NASDAQ for the five days following the Closing
Date. Any such sale shall be made by the Exchange Agent within five (5)
Business Days after the Closing Date.

 



 

(h) _Merger Consideration_. The aggregate consideration payable with respect
to the First Merger (the " _Merger Consideration_ ") shall consist of all of
the consideration to be paid as set forth in _Section 2.1(b)_, _2.1(c)_ and
_2.1(d)_.

 



 

SECTION 2.2 _Effect of the Second Merger_.

 



 

(a) _Second Merger Effective Time_. The Second Merger shall become effective
at the time specified in the Second Certificate of Merger (the " _Second
Merger Effective Time_ "), which shall be immediately following the First
Merger Effective Time. At the Second Merger Effective Time, the separate
existence of the Surviving Corporation shall cease and NewCo shall continue
its existence under the DLLCA as the surviving company. The Second Merger
shall have the effects set forth in the Second Certificate of Merger and this
Agreement.

 



 

(b) _Conversion of Surviving Corporation Stock_. At the Second Merger
Effective Time, by virtue of the Second Merger and without any action on the
part of any party or the holder of any of their securities, each share of
common stock of the Surviving Corporation issued and outstanding immediately
prior to the Second Merger Effective Time shall automatically be cancelled and
retired and shall cease to exist, and no consideration shall be delivered in
exchange therefor.

 



 

SECTION 2.3 _Tax Treatment of the Mergers_.

 



 

(a) For U.S. federal income tax purposes (and for purposes of any applicable
state or local Tax that follows the U.S. federal income tax treatment), the
parties shall not take or

 



      
 

 



 

cause to be taken any action, or knowingly fail to take or cause to be taken
any action, which action or failure to act would reasonably be expected to
prevent (i) the Domestication from qualifying as a reorganization within the
meaning of Section 368(a)(1)(F) of the Code and (ii) the Mergers, taken
together, from qualifying as a reorganization within the meaning of Section
368(a)(1)(A) of the Code.

 



 

(b) For U.S. federal income tax purposes (and for purposes of any applicable
state or local Tax that follows the U.S. federal income tax treatment), except
in the case of Company Holders for which payments under the Tax Receivables
Agreement are treated as compensatory, the portion of any payment to Company
Holders under the Tax Receivables Agreement that is not treated as imputed
interest shall be treated as additional merger consideration that is taxable
in the taxable year in which such payment is received (i.e. "open transaction"
treatment shall apply); _provided_ , for the avoidance of doubt, that nothing
in this _Section 2.3_ shall preclude any Company Holder, or any direct or
indirect owner of a Company Holder from electing out of the installment method
or making determinations required by applicable Tax laws.

 



 

(c) For U.S. federal income tax purposes (and for purposes of any applicable
state or local Tax that follows the U.S. federal income tax treatment), the
parties will prepare and file all Tax Returns consistent with the foregoing
provisions of this _Section 2.3_ and will not take any inconsistent position
on any Tax Return, or during the course of any audit, litigation or other
proceeding with respect to Taxes, except as otherwise required by applicable
Laws following a final determination by a court of competent jurisdiction or
good-faith administrative settlement with (or final administrative decision
by) the relevant Governmental Entity.

 



 

(d) The parties agree that Parent may cause the Domestication to be
consummated at any time prior to the Closing.

 



 

SECTION 2.4 _Withholding Taxes_. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to
the contrary, Parent, the Surviving NewCo (including its payroll agent), the
Exchange Agent and their Affiliates shall be entitled to deduct and withhold
from the consideration otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement, any
amount required to be deducted and withheld with respect to the making of such
payment under applicable Tax Laws. To the extent that amounts are so properly
withheld by Parent, the Surviving NewCo, the Surviving Corporation or their
Affiliates, as the case may be, such withheld amounts shall be treated for all
purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the Person in respect of
which such deduction and withholding was made.

 



 

SECTION 2.5 _Closing Deliverables_.

 



 

(a) At the Closing, the Company shall deliver to Parent:

 



 

(i) the resignations of each non-employee director of the Company set forth on
Schedule 2.5(a)(i) of the Company Disclosure Schedule;

 



 

(ii) a duly executed counterpart of each Ancillary Agreement to be executed
prior to or at the Closing to which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is
party;

 



       
 

 



 

(iii) evidence reasonably satisfactory to Parent that the agreements to be
terminated pursuant to _Section 5.19_ have been duly terminated with no
liability (of any nature) to Parent, the Company, its Subsidiaries or their
successor entities;

 



 

(iv) a certificate from the Company reasonably acceptable to Parent, dated as
of the Closing Date, and signed by a responsible corporate officer of the
Company, stating that the interests in the Company are not, and have not been
at any time during the five year period described in Section 897(c) of the

SECTION 2.8 _Cash Consideration Proration_.

 



 

(a) Notwithstanding any other provision contained in this Agreement, if the
aggregate amount of cash payments of Per Share Cash Consideration (including
in respect of Cash Election Warrants) and Per SAR/Option Cash Consideration
with respect to which a Cash Election shall have been made (which, for this
purpose, shall be deemed to include the Dissenting Shares as determined as of
the Effective Time) (the " _Aggregate Cash Election Amount_ ") exceeds the
Cash Component, then all of the Company Holders Cash Elections shall

 



      
 

 



 

be reduced (rounded down to the nearest whole number) and deemed revoked by a
percentage obtained by dividing (x) the Cash Component _by_ (y) the Aggregate
Cash Election Amount.

 



 

(b) The Exchange Agent will make all the computations contemplated by this
_Section 2.8_, including the determination of the number of Cash Elections
and the Aggregate Cash Election Amount, after giving effect to the adjustment
contemplated hereunder, and all such computations will be conclusive and
binding on the former Company Holders absent manifest error.

 



 

SECTION 2.9 _Election Procedures_. Each holder of record of shares of Company
Common Stock, Company Series A Warrants, Company SARs or Company Options to be
converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration in accordance
with, and subject to, this Article II (a " _Holder_ ") shall have the right,
subject to the limitations set forth in this Article II, to submit an election
in accordance with the following procedures:

 



 

(a) Each Holder may specify in a request made in accordance with the
provisions of this _Section 2.9_ (herein called a " _Cash Election_ " ") the
number of shares of Company Common Stock owned by such Holder (or underlying
the Company Series A Warrant, Company SARs or Company Option, as applicable)
with respect to which such Holder desires to make a Cash Election. Holders of
record of Company Common Stock who hold such Company Common Stock as nominees,
trustees or in other representative capacities may submit a separate Form of
Election on or before the Election Deadline with respect to each beneficial
owner for whom such nominee, trustee or representative holds such Company
Common Stock. Any Holder who makes a Cash Election shall be required to waive
all appraisal rights in connection with making such Cash Election.

 



 

(b) Parent shall prepare a form of election reasonably acceptable to the
Company, including appropriate and customary transmittal materials in such
form as prepared by Parent and reasonably acceptable to the Company, in
accordance with the terms of this Agreement (the " _Form of Election_"), so
as to permit Holders to exercise their right to make an Election, and (i)
shall direct the Exchange Agent to mail or transmit in electronic form the
Form of Election within 5 Business Days (or such later date agreed by the
Company and Parent) after the date of engagement of the Exchange Agent, to the
record holders of Company Common Stock as of the date hereof, and (ii)
following such date, shall use reasonable best efforts to make available as
promptly as practicable a Form of Election to any stockholder, warrantholder,
or optionholder who requests such Form of Election prior to the Election
Deadline, which Form of Election shall be used by each record holder of shares
of Company Common Stock who wishes to make an Election. The time period
between such mailing date and the Election Deadline is referred to herein as
the " _Election Period_ ".

 



 

(c) Any Election shall have been made properly only if the Exchange Agent
shall have received, during the Election Period, a Form of Election properly
completed and signed (including duly executed transmittal materials included
in the Form of Election) any additional documents specified in the procedures
set forth in the Form of Election. As used herein, unless otherwise agreed in
advance by the parties, " _Election Deadline_ " means 5:00 p.m. local time (in
the city in which the principal office of the Exchange Agent is located) on
the

 



      
 

 



 

earliest practicable date which the parties shall agree, but in any event, no
less than 10 Business Days preceding the Closing Date.

 



 

(d) Any Holder may, at any time prior to the Election Deadline, change or
revoke such Holders Election by written notice received by the Exchange Agent
prior to the Election Deadline accompanied by a properly completed and signed
revised Form of Election or by withdrawal prior to the Election Deadline of
such Holders book entry interests, previously deposited with the Exchange
Agent. After a Cash Election is validly made with respect to any shares of
Company Common Stock, such Election must be revoked prior to any subsequent
transfer of the shares of Company Common Stock as to which such Cash Election
relates. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, all Cash
Elections shall be automatically deemed revoked upon receipt by the Exchange
Agent of written notification from the Company that this Agreement has been
terminated in accordance with Article VII. The Exchange Agent shall have
reasonable discretion to determine if any Election is not properly made with
respect to any shares of Company Common Stock (none of the parties or the
Exchange Agent being under any duty to notify any stockholder of any such
defect). In the event the Exchange Agent makes such a determination, such Cash
Election shall be deemed to be not in effect, and the shares of Company Common
Stock covered by such Cash Election shall, for purposes hereof, be deemed to
have not made a Cash Election, unless a proper Cash Election is thereafter
timely made with respect to such shares.

 



 

(e) Subject to the terms of this Agreement and the Form of Election, Parent,
in the exercise of its reasonable discretion (in consultation with the
Company), shall have the right to make all determinations, not inconsistent
with the terms of this Agreement, governing the validity of the Forms of
Election and compliance by any Holder with the Cash Election procedures set
forth herein.

 



 

SECTION 2.10 _Dissenting Shares_. Notwithstanding any provision of this
Agreement to the contrary, shares of Company Common Stock that are issued and
outstanding immediately prior to the First Merger Effective Time and which are
held by holders of such shares of Company Common Stock who properly exercise
appraisal rights with respect thereto in accordance with Section 262 of the
DGCL (the " _Dissenting Shares_ ") shall not be converted into or represent
the right to receive the Merger Consideration pursuant to this Article II, and
holders of such Dissenting Shares will be entitled only to receive payment of
the appraised value of such shares of Company Common Stock in accordance with
the provisions of such Section 262 unless and until such holders fail to
perfect or effectively withdraw or lose their rights to appraisal and payment
under the DGCL. If, after the Effective Time, any such holder fails to perfect
or effectively withdraws or loses such right, such shares of Company Common
Stock will thereupon be treated as if they had been converted into and to have
become exchangeable for, at the Effective Time, the right to receive the
Merger Consideration as provided in _Section 2.1(b)_ without any interest
thereon. The Company shall give Parent (i) prompt notice of any demands
received by the Company for appraisals of shares of Company Common Stock and
(ii) the opportunity to direct all negotiations and proceedings with respect
to demands for appraisal under the DGCL. The Company shall not, except with
the prior written consent of Parent, make any payment with respect to any
demands for appraisal or offer to settle or settle any such demands.

 



      
 

 



 

SECTION 2.11 _Aggregate Payment Amount_. At least five (5) Business Days prior
to Closing, Parent shall have received a certificate of the Company signed by
its Chief Executive Officer stating whether the stockholder approval set forth
on Schedule 8.1(b) shall have been obtained and, if so, evidence thereof
reasonably satisfactory to Parent. At least five (5) Business Days prior to
the Closing, the Company shall deliver to Parent in writing a certificate
signed by a duly authorized officer of the Company setting forth (i) the
Companys good faith calculation of the Company Transaction Expenses, along
with reasonable supporting details demonstrating the calculation of each
component of Company Transaction Expenses and (ii) the Aggregate Payment
Amount, together with reasonable supporting details demonstrating the
calculation of each component of the Aggregate Payment Amount, including each
component of Leakage (the " _Closing Certificate_ "). The Company shall, and
shall cause each of its Subsidiaries to promptly provide reasonable access to
the financial records, supporting documents and work papers and personnel of
the Company and its Subsidiaries to Parent and its accountants and other
representatives during the review by Parent of the Closing Certificate. The
Company shall review any comments proposed by Parent with respect to the
Closing Certificate (and the components thereof) and will consider in good
faith any appropriate changes thereto prior to the Closing. The Closing
Certificate and the amounts set forth therein (as revised to include changes
proposed by Parent and accepted by the Company in good faith, if any) shall be
final upon the Closing for all purposes under this Agreement.

as to allow for such disclosure in a manner that does not result in the loss
of attorney-client privilege.

 



 

(b) Notwithstanding anything contained herein, from and after the date of this
Agreement until the earlier of the Closing or the termination of this
Agreement in accordance with its terms, Parent shall not be permitted to
contact any of the Company or its Subsidiaries vendors, employees, customers
or suppliers, or any Governmental Entities (except in connection with
applications for Permits or filings required to be made prior to the Closing
under this Agreement and, in such case, only in accordance with the terms of
this Agreement) regarding the operations or legal status of the Company or any
of its Subsidiaries without receiving prior written consent from the Company
(which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed).

 



 

(c) Following the Closing, Parent shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries to,
(i) preserve and keep the Tax and accounting records of the Company and its
Subsidiaries for a

execution and delivery of this Agreement and shall apply to all information
furnished thereunder or hereunder and any other activities contemplated
thereby. The Company acknowledges that, in connection with the equity
financing relating to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, Parent
shall be entitled to disclose, pursuant to the Exchange Act, any information
contained in any presentation to the equity financing sources, which
information may include Confidential Information (as defined in the

Company with a reasonable opportunity to review and provide comments to such
presentation and the Company consents to the contents thereof.

 



 

SECTION 5.3 _Parent Shareholders  Meeting; Company Stockholders_.

 



 

(a) Parent shall: (a) take all action necessary under applicable Law and its
Organizational Documents to call, give notice of, convene and hold a general
meeting of its shareholders (the " _Parent Shareholders Meeting_ ") to seek
(i) adoption and approval of this Agreement and the transactions contemplated
hereby by the holders of Parent Ordinary Shares in accordance with applicable
Law and exchange rules and regulations and the approval of the issuance of
Parent Ordinary Shares in accordance herewith, (ii) approval of the
Domestication, (iii) amendment and restatement of the Parent Organizational
Documents, in substantially the forms attached as _Exhibits D_ and _E_ to this
Agreement (as may be subsequently amended by mutual written agreement of the
Company and Parent at any time before the Proxy Statement is mailed to the
Parents shareholders), and (iv) approval of any other proposals reasonably
agreed by Parent and the Company to be necessary or appropriate in connection
with the transactions contemplated hereby (such proposals, together, the "
_Transaction Proposals_ "), which Parent Shareholders Meeting will be held as
promptly as reasonably practicable following the approval for distribution of
the Proxy Statement by the SEC (and conditioned upon such approval), and in no
event more than 30 days after the date on which Parent mails the Proxy
Statement to its shareholders (unless otherwise agreed by Parent and the
Company, such consent not to be unreasonably withheld); and (b) submit the
Transaction Proposals to, and use its reasonable best efforts to solicit
proxies in favor of such Transaction Proposals from, such holders at the
Parent Shareholders Meeting. Parent shall, through the Parent Board, include a
statement in the Proxy Statement to the effect that the Parent Board
recommends that the Parent shareholders vote in favor of the Transaction
Proposals (the " _Parent Board Recommendation_ "). The Parent Board (including
any committee or subgroup thereof) shall not change, withdraw, withhold,
qualify or modify in a manner adverse to the Company, the Parent Board
Recommendation (a " _Change in Recommendation_ "); provided, however, that the
Parent Board may make a Change in Recommendation if it determines in good
faith, after written advice from its outside legal counsel, that a failure to
make a Change in Recommendation would reasonably be expected to constitute a
breach by the Parent Board of its fiduciary obligations under applicable Law.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, Parent
may adjourn or postpone the Parent Shareholder Meeting (x) to the extent
necessary to ensure that any required supplement or amendment to the Proxy
Statement is provided to Parents shareholders or, if as of the time for which
the Parent Shareholders Meeting is scheduled there are insufficient Parent

 



      
 

 



 

Ordinary Shares represented (either in person or by proxy) to constitute a
quorum necessary to conduct business at such meeting or (y) by no more than
five Business Days in order to solicit additional proxies from shareholders of
Parent in favor of the adoption of each of the Transaction Proposals,
provided, that in the event of a postponement or adjournment pursuant to
clause (x) above, the Parent Shareholders Meeting shall be reconvened as
promptly as practicable following such time as the matters described in such
clauses have been resolved, and in no event shall the Parent Shareholders
Meeting be reconvened on a date that is later than five Business Days prior to
the Termination Date.

 



 

(b) Promptly following the date of the Company Stockholder Approval, the
Company shall deliver (A) in accordance with Section 228(e) of the DGCL, a
notice of written consent to the holders of Company Common Stock who did not
execute written consents constituting the approval of the adoption of this
Agreement as required by the DGCL for the purpose of informing them of the
approval of the adoption of this Agreement and the transactions contemplated
hereby, including, without limitation, the First Merger, and (B) in accordance
with Section 262(d)(2) of the DGCL, a notice regarding appraisal rights to all
holders of Company Common Stock regarding the availability of appraisal
rights.

 



 

(c) As promptly as practicable after the date on which Parent mails the Proxy
Statement to its shareholders, the Company shall jointly deliver the Proxy
Statement to all holders of Company Common Stock who are not "accredited
investors" as defined in Rule 501(a) of Regulation D under the Securities Act.

 



 

(d) As promptly as reasonably practicable after the date hereof, Parent shall
provide and the Company shall distribute to each holder of Company Common
Stock an investor questionnaire in form and substance reasonably satisfactory
to the Company regarding whether such holder of Company Common Stock is an
"accredited investor" as defined in Rule 501(a) of Regulation D under the
Securities Act. The Company shall use commercially reasonable efforts to cause
each holder of Company Common Stock to return the investor questionnaires by
the twentieth Business Day following the date hereof. For the avoidance of
doubt, obtaining such investor questionnaires from each holder of Company
Common Stock shall not be a condition to the Closing.

 



 

SECTION 5.4 _Antitrust Approvals and Other Approvals; Efforts_.

 



 

(a) Except for the filings and notifications made pursuant to the Premerger
Notification Rules or other applicable Antitrust Laws to which _Sections
5.4(b)_ and _(c)_ , and not this _Section 5.4(a)_ , shall apply, promptly
following the execution of this Agreement, the parties shall proceed to
prepare and file with the appropriate Governmental Entities all
authorizations, consents, notifications, certifications, registrations,
declarations and filings that are necessary in order to consummate the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement and shall diligently and
expeditiously pursue, and shall cooperate fully with each other in the pursuit
of, such matters.

 



 

(b) As promptly as reasonably practicable following the execution of this
Agreement, but in no event later than ten (10) Business Days (or such other
date agreed to by Parent and the Company) following the date of this
Agreement, the parties shall make all pre-merger notification filings required
under the HSR Act; and the parties shall make all other pre-

 



      
 

 



 

merger notification filings required under the Premerger Notification Rules as
promptly as practicable following the execution of this Agreement. Each of
Parent and the Company shall cooperate fully with each other and shall furnish
to the other such necessary information and reasonable assistance as the other
may reasonably request in connection with its preparation of any filings under
any Premerger Notification Rules. Unless otherwise agreed, Parent and the
Company shall each use its reasonable best efforts to ensure the prompt
expiration of any applicable waiting period, termination of any suspensory
obligation or the clearance or approval under any Premerger Notification Rules
(" _Antitrust Approvals_ "). Parent and the Company shall each use its
reasonable best efforts to respond to and comply, as advisable, with any
request for information from any Governmental Entity charged with enforcing,
applying, administering, or investigating any applicable Laws designed to
prohibit, restrict or regulate actions for the purpose or effect of
monopolization, restraining trade, lessening of competition or abusing a
dominant position (collectively, " _Antitrust Laws_ ") or Premerger
Notification Rules, including the U.S. Federal Trade Commission, the U.S.
Department of Justice, any attorney general of any state of the United States,
the European Commission or any other competition authority of any jurisdiction
(" _Antitrust Authority_ ") or other Governmental Entity. Parent and the
Company shall keep each other apprised of the status of any communications
with, and any inquiries or requests for additional information from any
Antitrust Authority or other Governmental Entity. Parent, in consultation with
the Company, shall be entitled to direct any proceedings or negotiations with
any Antitrust Authority, any Governmental Entity or other Person relating to
any of the foregoing. Unless expressly prohibited by a Governmental Entity,
Parent shall, to the extent practicable, permit the Company to participate in
any material meeting or communication with a Governmental Entity with regard
to obtaining any Antitrust Approvals. Parent shall pay all filing fees
associated with any filing under the HSR Act and any other required Premerger
Notification Rules.

 



 

(c) Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, each of the parties
hereto will use its reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all
actions and to do, or cause to be done, all things necessary, proper or
advisable under applicable Law, as determined by each of the parties hereto in
their reasonable discretion, to consummate the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement, including using reasonable best efforts to (i) cause the
conditions precedent set forth in _Article VI_ to be satisfied, (ii) obtain
all necessary waivers, consents, approvals, permits, orders or authorizations
(including the expiration or termination of any waiting periods) from
Governmental Entities and the making of all necessary registrations,
declarations and filings (including registrations, declarations and filings
with Governmental Entities, if any), (iii) obtain all necessary waivers,
consents, approvals, permits, orders or authorizations from third parties to
the extent required for the consummation of the transactions contemplated
hereby, and (iv) execute and deliver additional instruments necessary to
consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

 



 

(d) Parent shall not, nor shall they permit their respective Subsidiaries to,
acquire or agree to acquire any rights, assets, business, person or division
thereof (through acquisition, license, joint venture, collaboration or
otherwise), if such acquisition, would reasonably be expected to increase the
risk of not obtaining any applicable clearance, consent, approval or waiver
under any Premerger Notification Rules with respect to this Agreement.

 



      
 

 



 

SECTION 5.5 _Indemnification; Directors  and Officers Insurance_.

 



 

(a) Without limiting any other rights that any Indemnified Person may have
pursuant to any employment agreement, indemnification agreement or otherwise,
from and after the First Merger Effective Time, Parent shall and shall cause
the Surviving Corporation, and from and after the Second Merger Effective Time
the Surviving NewCo, to indemnify, defend and hold harmless each Person who is
now, or has been at any time prior to the date of this Agreement or who
becomes prior to the First Merger Effective Time, subject to the terms hereof,
a director or officer of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries (the "
_Indemnified Persons_ ") against all losses, claims, damages, costs, fines,
penalties, expenses (including reasonable attorneys and other professionals
fees and expenses, and including the advancement of such expenses),
liabilities or judgments or amounts that are paid in settlement with the
approval of the indemnifying party (which approval shall not be unreasonably
withheld, delayed or conditioned) of or in connection with any threatened or
actual claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation based in whole or in
part on or arising in whole or in part out of the fact that such Person is or
was a director or officer of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or by
reason of anything done or not done by such Person in any such capacity
whether pertaining to any act or omission occurring or existing prior to, at
or after the First Merger Effective Time and whether asserted or claimed prior
to, at or after the First Merger Effective Time (" _Indemnified Liabilities_
"), including all Indemnified Liabilities based in whole or in part on, or
arising in whole or in part out of, or pertaining to, this Agreement or the
transactions contemplated hereby, in each case to the fullest extent permitted
under applicable Laws. Any Indemnified Person wishing to claim indemnification
under this _Section 5.5_ , upon learning of any such claim, action, suit,
proceeding or investigation, shall notify Parent and the Surviving Corporation
or the Surviving NewCo, as applicable, (but the failure so to notify shall not
relieve a party from any liability that it may have under this _Section 5.5_
except to the extent such failure materially prejudices such partys position
with respect to such claims) and shall deliver to Parent and the Surviving
Corporation or the Surviving NewCo, as applicable, any undertaking required by
applicable Law.

 



 

(b) Parent, the Surviving Corporation and the Surviving NewCo shall not amend,
repeal or otherwise modify the Organizational Documents of the Surviving
Corporation or the Surviving NewCo or any of its Subsidiaries in any manner
that would affect adversely the rights thereunder with respect to periods
prior to the First Merger Effective Time of individuals who at and at any time
prior to the First Merger Effective Time were directors or officers of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries, except to the extent required by Law.
Parent shall, and shall cause the Surviving Corporation or the Surviving NewCo
to, fulfill and honor any indemnification agreements, or exculpation,
indemnification and advancement of expenses provisions of any employment
agreement, in each case, between the Company, on the one hand, and any of
their respective directors, officers or employees existing as of the date
hereof, on the other hand, solely to the extent such indemnification
agreements have been provided or made available to Parent prior to the date
hereof.

 



 

(c) Parent agrees that the Company will cause to be put in place and shall
fully prepay immediately prior to the First Merger Effective Time a "tail"
insurance policies with a claims period of at least six (6) years from the
First Merger Effective Time from an insurance carrier with the same or better
credit rating as the Companys current insurance carrier with respect to
directors and officers liability insurance in an amount and scope at least
as favorable as the Companys existing policies with respect to matters, acts
or omissions existing or occurring at or prior to the First Merger Effective
Time; _provided_ , _however_ , that if the aggregate

 



      
 

 



 

annual premiums for such insurance policies exceed 250% of the per annum rate
of premiums currently paid for such insurance policies, then the Company shall
purchase and maintain insurance policies or tail insurance providing for the
maximum coverage that shall then be available at an annual premium equal to
250% of such rate. For the avoidance of doubt, any costs or expenses of the
tail policy or in connection therewith shall not be a Company Transaction
Expense.

 



 

(d) In the event that Parent, the Surviving Corporation, the Surviving NewCo
or any of their respective successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or
merges into any other Person and shall not be the continuing or surviving
corporation or entity of such consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers all or
substantially all of its properties and assets to any Person, then, in each
such case, proper provisions shall be made so that the successors and assigns
of such Person shall assume the obligations set forth in this _Section 5.5_.
The provisions of this _Section 5.5_ are intended to be for the benefit of,
and shall be enforceable by, the parties hereto and each Person entitled to
indemnification pursuant to this _Section 5.5_.

 



 

SECTION 5.6 _Public Announcements_. None of the parties will make any public
announcement or issue any public communication regarding this Agreement or the
Transaction Proposals or any matter related to the foregoing without the prior
written consent of the Company (prior to Closing) or the Seller Group
(following Closing) in the case of a public announcement by Parent, or Parent,
in the case of a public announcement by the Company or Seller Group (such
consents, in either case, not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or
delayed), except (A) if such announcement or other communication is required
by applicable Law, in which case the disclosing party shall, to the extent
permitted by applicable Law, first allow such other parties to review such
announcement or communication and the opportunity to comment thereon and the
disclosing party shall consider such comments in good faith, (B) to the extent
such announcements or other communications contain only information previously
disclosed in a public statement, press release or other communication
previously approved in accordance with this _Section 5.6_ , and (C)

inquiry and investigation into, and, based thereon has formed an independent
judgment concerning, Parent, the Company and their respective Subsidiaries,
and, in each case, their businesses and operations, and each such Person has
requested such documents and information from each of the other applicable
Persons as each such Person considers material in determining whether to enter
into this Agreement and to consummate the transactions contemplated in this
Agreement. Each such Person acknowledges and agrees that it has had an
opportunity to ask all questions of such other Persons with respect to any
matter such party considers material in determining whether to enter into this

representations and warranties of Parent and its Subsidiaries that are
expressly set forth in _Section 3.2_ of this Agreement or any certificate
delivered pursuant to this Agreement, and any representations and warranties
of such Person expressly set forth in any Ancillary Agreement, no party to
this Agreement has made and shall not be deemed to have made any
representation or warranty of any kind with respect to the matters
contemplated by this Agreement or any materials heretofore or hereafter
delivered to or made available to each of the other applicable Persons or
their respective representatives or Affiliates. Without limiting the
generality of the foregoing, each of Parent, Merger Sub and NewCo agrees that
neither the Company nor any of its Affiliates or Representatives, makes or has
made any representation or warranty to Parent, Merger Sub, NewCo or any of
their Affiliates or Representatives with respect to:

 



 

(i) any projections, forecasts or other estimates, plans or budgets of future
revenues, expenses or expenditures, future results of operations (or any
component thereof), future cash flows (or any component thereof) or future

Subsidiaries or the future business, operations or affairs of the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries heretofore or hereafter delivered to or made available
to Parent or any of its Affiliates or Representatives; or

 



 

(ii) any other information, statement or documents heretofore or hereafter
delivered to or made available to Parent or any of its Affiliates or
Representatives, except to the extent and as expressly covered by a
representation and warranty made by the Company and contained in _Section 3.1_
of this Agreement or any certificate delivered pursuant to this Agreement.

 



 

(c) Nothing in this Agreement (including this _Section 5.7_ ) shall relieve
any party hereto of any liability for or limit any Persons ability to seek
any remedy in the event of fraud. For purposes of this Agreement, " _fraud_ "
means intentional fraud involving a knowing and intentional misrepresentation
of a fact or concealment of a fact made or concealed with the intent of
inducing any other party hereto to enter into this Agreement or the Ancillary
Agreements and upon which such other party has reasonably relied (and does not
include any fraud claim based on constructive knowledge, negligent
misrepresentation, recklessness or a similar theory).

 



 

SECTION 5.8 _Nasdaq Listing_. From the date of this Agreement until the
earlier of the Closing or the termination of this Agreement in accordance with
its terms, Parent shall use reasonable best efforts to (x) ensure that Parent
remains listed as a public company on, and for the Parent Common Stock to be
tradable over, the Nasdaq Capital Market (the " _Nasdaq_ ") and (y) have
Parent listed on the Nasdaq as of Closing.

 



 

SECTION 5.9 _Transaction Litigation_. Each party hereto shall give the other
party the opportunity to participate in the defense, settlement or prosecution

Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby at such partys sole cost
and expense. Prior to the Closing Date, no party hereto shall compromise,
settle, come to an arrangement regarding or agree to compromise, settle or

have consented in writing (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed).

 



 

SECTION 5.10 _Section 16 Matters_. Prior to the Closing, Parent shall take all
such steps as may be required (to the extent permitted under applicable Law

of Code Section 280G, the Company shall (i) use commercially reasonable
efforts to obtain waivers from each Person who has a right to any payments
and/or benefits as a result of or in connection with the transactions
contemplated herein that would be deemed to constitute "parachute payments"
(within the meaning of Code Section 280G) (such waived amounts, the " _Waived
280G Benefits_ ") so that all remaining payments and/or benefits applicable to
such Person shall not be deemed to be "excess parachute payments" (within the
meaning of Code Section 280G), and (ii) following the execution of the waivers
described in clause (i), solicit approval by the stockholders of the Company
of the Waived 280G Benefits by a vote that satisfies the requirements of Code
Section 280G(b)(5)(B) and the regulations thereunder. Prior to, and in no
event later than five (5) Business Days prior to soliciting such waivers and
approval, the Company shall provide drafts of such waivers and approval
materials to Parent for its reasonable review and the Company shall reflect in

seven (7) Business Days prior to soliciting the waivers, the Company shall
provide Parent with the calculations and related documentation required to

4999. At least one (1) Business Days prior to the Closing Date, the Company
shall deliver to Parent evidence that a vote of the stockholders of the
Company was solicited in accordance with the foregoing and whether the
requisite number of votes of the stockholders of the Company was obtained with
respect to the Waived 280G Benefits or that the vote did not pass and the
Waived 280G Benefits will not be paid or retained.

covenant or agreement to be complied with or satisfied by it hereunder. For

SECTION 8.5 _Rules of Construction_.

 



 

(a) Each of the parties hereto acknowledges that it has been represented by
counsel of its choice throughout all negotiations that have preceded the
execution of this Agreement and that it has executed the same with the advice
of said independent counsel. Each party and its counsel cooperated in the
drafting and preparation of this Agreement and the documents referred to
herein, and any and all drafts relating thereto exchanged between the parties
shall be deemed the work product of the parties and may not be construed
against any party by reason of its preparation. Accordingly, any rule of law
or any legal decision that would require interpretation of any ambiguities in
this Agreement against any party that drafted it is of no application and is
hereby expressly waived.

 



 

(b) The inclusion of any information in the Company Disclosure Schedule or
Parent Disclosure Schedule shall not be deemed an admission or acknowledgment,
in and of itself and solely by virtue of the inclusion of such information in
the Company Disclosure Schedule or Parent Disclosure Schedule, as applicable,
that such information is required to be listed in the Company Disclosure
Schedule or Parent Disclosure Schedule, as applicable, or that such items are
material to the Company, Parent, Merger Sub or NewCo, as the case may be. The
headings, if any, of the individual sections of each of the Parent Disclosure
Schedule and Company Disclosure Schedule are inserted for convenience only and
shall not be deemed to constitute a part thereof or a part of this Agreement.
The Company Disclosure Schedule and Parent Disclosure Schedule are arranged in
sections corresponding to those contained in this Agreement merely for
convenience, and the disclosure of an item in one section of the Company
Disclosure Schedule or Parent Disclosure Schedule as an exception to a
particular representation or warranty shall be deemed adequately disclosed as
an exception with respect to all other representations or warranties to the
extent that the relevance of such item to such representations or warranties
is reasonably apparent on the face of such item, notwithstanding the presence
or absence of an appropriate section of the Company Disclosure Schedule or
Parent Disclosure Schedule with respect to such other representations or
warranties or an appropriate cross reference thereto.

 



 

(c) The specification of any dollar amount in the representations and
warranties or otherwise in this Agreement or in the Company Disclosure
Schedule or Parent Disclosure Schedule is not intended and shall not be deemed
to be an admission or acknowledgment of the materiality of such amounts or
items, nor shall the same be used in any dispute or controversy between the
parties to determine whether any obligation, item or matter (whether or not
described herein or included in any schedule) is or is not material for
purposes of this Agreement. With respect to any dollar amount thresholds set
forth in the representations and warranties herein for which the Company is
making a disclosure with respect to a Contract or

 



      
 

 



 

other item which is denominated in a currency other than United States
Dollars, such non United States Dollar amounts shall be deemed to be converted
to United States Dollars for the purposes of this Agreement at an exchange
rate determined by the Company in good-faith as of the date of this Agreement
and any change in exchange rates after the date hereof shall not result in a
breach of such representation or warranty by the Company.

(a) Except as otherwise provided in this Agreement, any and all remedies
herein expressly conferred upon a party will be deemed cumulative with and not
exclusive of any other remedy expressly conferred hereby, and the exercise by
a party of any one such remedy will not preclude the exercise of any other
such remedy.

 



 

(b) The parties understand and agree that the covenants and undertakings on
each of their parts herein contained are uniquely related to the desire of the
parties and their respective Affiliates to consummate the transactions
contemplated hereby, that the transactions contemplated hereby represent a
unique business opportunity at a unique time for each of the parties hereto
and their respective Affiliates and further agree that irreparable damage
would occur in the event that any provision of this Agreement were not
performed in accordance with its terms and further agree that, although
monetary damages may be available for the breach of such covenants and
undertakings, monetary damages would be an inadequate remedy therefor.
Accordingly, each party hereto agrees, on behalf of itself and its Affiliates,
that, in the event of any breach or threatened breach by the Company, on the
one hand, or Parent, Merger Sub or NewCo, on the other hand, of any of their
respective covenants or obligations set forth in this Agreement, the Company,
on the one hand, or Parent, Merger Sub or NewCo, on the other hand, shall be
entitled to seek an injunction or injunctions, specific performance and other
equitable relief to prevent or restrain breaches or threatened breaches of
this Agreement, and to specifically enforce the terms and provisions of this
Agreement to prevent breaches or threatened breaches of, or to enforce
compliance with, the covenants and obligations of the other under this
Agreement. Any party seeking an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches
of this Agreement or to enforce specifically the terms and provisions of this
Agreement shall not be required to provide any bond or other security in
connection with any such order or injunction. In the event that any litigation
should be brought in equity to enforce the provisions of this Agreement, no
party shall allege, and each party hereto hereby waives the defense, that
there is an adequate remedy at law.

 



 

(c) The remedies available to the parties hereto pursuant to this _Section
8.8_ shall be in addition to any other remedy to which it is entitled at law
or in equity. To the extent any party hereto brings an action, suit or
proceeding to enforce specifically the performance of the terms and provisions
of this Agreement (other than an action to enforce specifically any provision
that expressly survives termination of this Agreement) when expressly
available to such party pursuant to the terms of this Agreement, the
Termination Date shall automatically be extended to (i) the twentieth (20th)
Business Day following the resolution of such action, suit or proceeding or
(ii) such other time period established by the court presiding over such
action, suit or proceeding.

 



 

SECTION 8.9 _Governing Law; Venue; Waiver of Jury Trial_.

 



 

(a) This Agreement, and any claim or cause of action hereunder based upon,
arising out of or related to this Agreement (whether based on law, in equity,
in contract, in tort or any other theory) or the negotiation, execution,
performance or enforcement of this Agreement, shall be governed by and
construed in accordance with the Laws of the State of Delaware, without giving
effect to the principles of conflicts of law thereof. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, each of the parties hereto hereby irrevocably agrees (A) that any
action, whether in law or in equity, whether in contract or in tort or
otherwise, involving any Debt Financing Source or its

 



       
 

 



 

Affiliates arising out of or relating to the transactions contemplated hereby,
the Debt Financing or the performance of services thereunder or related
thereto shall be subject to the exclusive jurisdiction of any state or federal
court sitting in the Borough of Manhattan in the City of New York (and
appellate courts thereof) and each party hereto submits for itself and its
property with respect to any such action to the exclusive jurisdiction of such
court; (B) not to bring or permit any of their Affiliates to bring or support
anyone else in bringing any such action in any other court, (C) that service
of process, summons, notice or document by registered mail addressed to them
at their respective addresses shall be effective service of process against
them for any such action brought in any such court, (D) to waive and hereby
waives to the fullest extent permitted by law, any objection which any of them
may now or hereafter have to the laying of venue of, and the defense of an
inconvenient forum to the maintenance of, any such action in any such court
and (E) that any such action (whether for breach of contract, tortious conduct
or otherwise) shall be governed by, and construed in accordance with, the laws
of the State of New York, without reference to its conflicts of law
principles.

 



 

(b) THE PARTIES HERETO IRREVOCABLY SUBMIT TO THE EXCLUSIVE JURISDICTION OF THE
UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT FOR THE SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF NEW YORK, THE
SUPREME COURT OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK AND THE FEDERAL COURTS OF THE UNITED
STATES OF AMERICA LOCATED IN THE STATE OF NEW YORK SOLELY IN RESPECT OF THE
INTERPRETATION AND ENFORCEMENT OF THE PROVISIONS OF THIS AGREEMENT AND THE
DOCUMENTS REFERRED TO IN THIS AGREEMENT AND IN RESPECT OF THE TRANSACTIONS
CONTEMPLATED HEREBY, AND HEREBY WAIVE, AND AGREE NOT TO ASSERT, AS A DEFENSE
IN ANY ACTION, SUIT OR PROCEEDING FOR INTERPRETATION OR ENFORCEMENT HEREOF OR
ANY SUCH DOCUMENT THAT IS NOT SUBJECT THERETO OR THAT SUCH ACTION, SUIT OR
PROCEEDING MAY NOT BE BROUGHT OR IS NOT MAINTAINABLE IN SAID COURTS OR THAT
VENUE THEREOF MAY NOT BE APPROPRIATE OR THAT THIS AGREEMENT OR ANY SUCH
DOCUMENT MAY NOT BE ENFORCED IN OR BY SUCH COURTS, AND THE PARTIES HERETO
IRREVOCABLY AGREE THAT ALL CLAIMS WITH RESPECT TO SUCH ACTION, SUIT OR
PROCEEDING SHALL BE HEARD AND DETERMINED BY SUCH A NEW YORK STATE OR FEDERAL
COURT. THE PARTIES HEREBY CONSENT TO AND GRANT ANY SUCH COURT JURISDICTION
OVER THE PERSON OF SUCH PARTIES AND OVER THE SUBJECT MATTER OF SUCH DISPUTE
AND AGREE THAT MAILING OF PROCESS OR OTHER PAPERS IN CONNECTION WITH SUCH
ACTION, SUIT OR PROCEEDING IN THE MANNER PROVIDED IN _SECTION 8.3_ OR IN SUCH
OTHER MANNER AS MAY BE PERMITTED BY LAW SHALL BE VALID AND SUFFICIENT SERVICE
THEREOF.

 



 

(c) EACH PARTY ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES THAT ANY CONTROVERSY WHICH MAY ARISE
UNDER THIS AGREEMENT OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY IS LIKELY TO
INVOLVE COMPLICATED AND DIFFICULT ISSUES, AND THEREFORE EACH SUCH PARTY HEREBY
IRREVOCABLY AND UNCONDITIONALLY WAIVES ANY RIGHT SUCH PARTY MAY HAVE TO A
TRIAL BY JURY IN RESPECT OF ANY LITIGATION DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY ARISING OUT
OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT OR ARISING OUT OF THE DEBT FINANCING OR THE
TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED BY THIS

 



      
 

 



 

AGREEMENT. EACH PARTY CERTIFIES AND ACKNOWLEDGES THAT (I) NO REPRESENTATIVE,
AGENT OR ATTORNEY OF ANY OTHER PARTY HAS REPRESENTED, EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE,
THAT SUCH OTHER PARTY WOULD NOT, IN THE EVENT OF LITIGATION, SEEK TO ENFORCE
THE FOREGOING WAIVER; (II) SUCH PARTY UNDERSTANDS AND HAS CONSIDERED THE
IMPLICATIONS OF THE FOREGOING WAIVER; (III) SUCH PARTY MAKES THE FOREGOING
WAIVER VOLUNTARILY AND (IV) SUCH PARTY HAS BEEN INDUCED TO ENTER INTO THIS
AGREEMENT BY, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE MUTUAL WAIVER AND CERTIFICATIONS IN THIS
_SECTION 8.9_.

 



 

SECTION 8.10 _No Remedy in Certain Circumstances_. Each party agrees that,
should any court or other competent authority hold any provision of this
Agreement or part hereof to be null, void or unenforceable, or order any party
to take any action inconsistent herewith or not to take an action consistent
herewith or required hereby, the validity, legality and enforceability of the
remaining provisions and obligations contained or set forth herein shall not
in any way be affected or impaired thereby, unless the foregoing inconsistent
action or the failure to take an action constitutes a material breach of this
Agreement or makes this Agreement impossible to perform, in which case this
Agreement shall terminate. Except as otherwise contemplated by this Agreement,
to the extent that a party hereto took an action inconsistent herewith or
failed to take action consistent herewith or required hereby pursuant to an
order or judgment of a court or other competent authority, such party shall
not incur any liability or obligation unless such party breached its
Obligations under this Agreement that was the proximate cause of such order or
judgment or did not in good faith seek to rescind or object to the imposition
or entering of such order or judgment.

 



 

SECTION 8.11 _Assignment_. Neither this Agreement nor any of the rights,
interests or obligations hereunder shall be assigned by any of the parties
hereto (whether by operation of law or otherwise) without the prior written
consent of the other parties; _provided_ , _however_ , that Parent may assign
any or all of its rights and obligations under this Agreement to its
Affiliates (although no such assignment shall relieve Parent of its
obligations to the other parties hereunder) without the prior written consent
of the other parties hereto. Subject to the preceding sentence, this Agreement
will be binding upon, inure to the benefit of and be enforceable by the
parties hereto and their respective successors and assigns. Any purported
assignment in violation of this _Section 8.11_ shall be void.

 



 

SECTION 8.12 _No-Recourse; Release_.

 



 

(a) Except to the extent a named party to this Agreement or any Ancillary
Agreement, the parties hereto acknowledge and agree that no past, present or
future member of the Purchaser Group, the Seller Group or the Debt Financing
Sources and their Affiliates (each a " _Non-Recourse Party_ "), in such
capacity, shall have any liability or obligation (whether based on law, in
equity, in contract, in tort or any other theory) to any party hereto of any
nature whatsoever in connection with or under this Agreement, the Debt
Financing or the transactions contemplated hereby, and each of the parties
hereto (on behalf of itself, its Affiliates, and its equityholders, managers,
officers, directors, employees and agents) hereby waives and releases all
claims of any such liability and obligation. This Agreement may only be
enforced against, and any action based upon, arising out of, or related to
this Agreement, or the negotiation,

 



      
 

 



 

execution or performance of this Agreement, may only be brought against the
entities that are expressly named as parties hereto and then only with respect
to the specific obligations set forth herein or therein with respect to such
party. Each Non-Recourse Party is expressly intended as a third-party
beneficiary of this _Section 8.12_.

 



 

(b) Effective upon and following the Closing, Parent, on its own behalf and on
behalf of each of its Subsidiaries and each of their respective Affiliates and
Representatives, generally, irrevocably, unconditionally and completely
releases and forever discharges each member of the Seller Group from all
disputes, claims, losses, controversies, demands, rights, liabilities, actions
and causes of action of every kind and nature, whether known or unknown,
arising from any matter concerning the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
occurring prior to the Closing Date, including for controlling equityholder
liability or breach of any fiduciary duty relating to any pre-Closing actions
or failures to act by the members of the Seller Group; _provided_ , _however_
, that nothing in this _Section 8.12(b)_ shall release the Company from its
obligations under this Agreement or the Ancillary Agreements.

 



 

(c) Effective upon and following the Closing, the Company, on its own behalf
and on behalf of each of its Subsidiaries and each of their respective
Affiliates and Representatives, generally, irrevocably, unconditionally and
completely releases and forever discharges each member of the Purchaser Group
and Seller Group from all disputes, claims, losses, controversies, demands,
rights, liabilities, actions and causes of action of every kind and nature,
whether known or unknown, arising from any matter concerning Parent or any of
its Subsidiaries or the Seller Group occurring prior to the Closing Date,
including for controlling equityholder liability or breach of any fiduciary
duty relating to any pre-Closing actions or failures to act by the members of
the Purchaser Group; _provided_ , _however_ , that nothing in this _Section
8.12(c)_ shall release the Parent, Merger Sub, NewCo or the Parent Sponsor
from its obligations under this Agreement or the Ancillary Agreements.

 



 

SECTION 8.13 _Amendment_. This Agreement may be amended by the parties hereto,
at any time before or after the receipt of the Parent Shareholder Approval,
but, after any such adoption, no amendment shall be made which by Law would
require the further approval by such shareholders without first obtaining such
further approval. This Agreement may not be amended except by an instrument in
writing signed (including by electronic means) on behalf of each of the
parties hereto; _provided_ that notwithstanding anything to the contrary set
forth herein, this _Section 8.13_ , _Section 8.7_ , _Section 8.9_ and _Section
8.12_ (and any related definitions to the extent a modification, waiver or
termination of such definitions would modify the substance of any of the
foregoing provisions) may not be amended, modified, waived or terminated in a
manner that is materially adverse to the Debt Financing Sources without the
prior written consent of such Debt Financing Sources.

 



 

SECTION 8.14 _Trust Account Waiver_. The Company acknowledges, on behalf of
itself, its Subsidiaries and the Seller Group, that Parent is a blank check
company with the powers and privileges to effect a Business Combination. The
Company further acknowledges that substantially all of Parents assets consist
of the cash proceeds of Parents initial public offering and private
placements of its securities and substantially all of those proceeds have been
deposited in the Trust Account for the benefit of Parent, certain of its
public shareholders and the underwriters of Parents initial public offering.
For and in consideration of

 



      
 

 



 

Parent entering into this Agreement, the receipt and sufficiency of which are
hereby acknowledged, the Company, on behalf of itself, its Subsidiaries and
the Seller Group, hereby irrevocably waives any right, title, interest or
claim of any kind they have or may have in the future in or to any monies in
the Trust Account and agrees not to seek recourse against the Trust Account or
any funds distributed therefrom as a result of, or arising out of, this
Agreement and any negotiations, contracts or agreements with Parent; provided,
that (a) nothing herein shall serve to limit or prohibit the Companys (or its
Subsidiaries or the Seller Groups) right to pursue a claim against Parent
pursuant to this Agreement for legal relief against monies or other assets of
Parent, Merger Sub or Surviving NewCo held outside the Trust Account, for
specific performance or other equitable relief in connection with the
transactions contemplated hereby or for fraud and (b) nothing herein shall
serve to limit or prohibit any claims that the Company (or its Subsidiaries or
the Seller Group) may have in the future pursuant to this Agreement against
Parents assets or funds that are not held in the Trust Account.

 



 

SECTION 8.15 _Conflict Waiver; Attorney-Client Privilege_.

 



 

(a) Each of the parties hereto acknowledges and agrees, on its own behalf and
on behalf of its directors, members, shareholders, partners, officers,
employees and Affiliates, that:

 



 

(i) Cahill Gordon and Reindel LLP has acted as counsel to the Seller Group, and
the Company in connection with the negotiation, preparation, execution and
delivery of this Agreement and the consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby. Parent agrees, and shall cause the Company and Surviving
NewCo to agree, that, following consummation of the transactions contemplated
hereby, such representation and any prior representation of the Company by
Cahill Gordon and Reindel LLP (or any successor) (the " _Seller Group Law Firm_
") shall not preclude Seller Group Law Firm from serving as counsel to the
Seller Group or any director, member, shareholder, partner, officer or
employee of the Seller Group, in connection with any litigation, claim or
obligation arising out of or relating to this Agreement or the transactions
contemplated hereby.

 



 

(ii) Weil, Gotshal and Manges LLP has acted as counsel to Parent in connection
with the negotiation, preparation, execution and delivery of this Agreement
and the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby. The parties
agree that, following consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby,
such representation and any prior representation of Parent by Weil, Gotshal and
Manges LLP (or any successor) shall not preclude Parent Group Law Firm from
serving as counsel to Parent, the Company or Surviving NewCo or any director,
member, shareholder, partner, officer or employee of Parent, the Company or
Surviving NewCo, in connection with any litigation, claim or obligation
arising out of or relating to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated
hereby.

 



 

(iii) Parent shall not, and shall cause the Company and Surviving NewCo not
to, seek or have Seller Group Law Firm disqualified from any such
representation based upon the prior representation of the Company by Seller
Group Law Firm. Each of the parties hereto hereby consents thereto and waives
any conflict of

 



      
 

 



 

interest arising from such prior representation, and each of such parties
shall cause any of its Affiliates to consent to waive any conflict of interest
arising from such representation. Each of the parties acknowledges that such
consent and waiver is voluntary, that it has been carefully considered, and
that the parties have consulted with counsel or have been advised they should
do so in connection herewith. The covenants, consent and waiver contained in
this Section shall not be deemed exclusive of any other rights to which the
Seller Group Law Firm is entitled whether pursuant to law, contract or
otherwise.

 



 

(b) All communications between the Seller Group or the Company, on the one
hand, and Seller Group Law Firm, on the other hand, relating to the
negotiation, preparation, execution and delivery of this Agreement and the
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby (the " _Privileged
Communications_ ") shall be deemed to be attorney-client privileged and the
expectation of client confidence relating thereto shall belong solely to the
Seller Group and shall not pass to or be claimed by Parent or the Company.
Immediately prior to the Closing, without need for further action, all right,
title and interest of the Company in and to any Privileged Communications,
whether in the possession of the Company or the Seller Group Law Firm, shall
transfer to and be vested solely in the Seller group. Parent and the Company
shall not have access to any Privileged Communications or to the files of
Seller Group Law Firm relating to such engagement from and after Closing.
Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, from and after the Closing,
(i) the Seller Group (and not Parent or the Company) shall be the sole holders
of the attorney-client privilege with respect to such engagement, and none of
Parent or the Company shall be a holder thereof, (ii) to the extent that files
of Seller Group Law Firm in respect of such engagement constitute property of
the client, only the Seller Group (and not Parent nor the Company) shall hold
such property rights and (iii) Seller Group Law Firm shall have no duty
whatsoever to reveal or disclose any such attorney-client communications or
files to Parent or the Company by reason of any attorney-client relationship
between Seller Group Law Firm and the Company or otherwise. Notwithstanding
the foregoing, in the event that a dispute arises between Parent or its
Affiliates (including the Company), on the one hand, and a third party other
than any of the Seller Group, on the other hand, Parent and its Affiliates
(including the Company) may assert the attorney-client privilege to prevent
disclosure of confidential communications to such third party; _provided,
however_ , that neither Parent nor any of its Affiliates (including the
Company) may waive such privilege without the prior written consent of the
Seller Group, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or
delayed. In the event that Parent or any of its Affiliates (including the
Company) is legally required by order of a Governmental Entity or otherwise
legally required to access or obtain a copy of all or a portion of the
Privileged Communications, to the extent (x) permitted by Applicable Law, and
(y) advisable in the opinion of Parents counsel, then Parent shall
immediately (notify Shareholder Representative in writing so that the
Shareholder Representative can seek a protective order.

 



 

(c) This Section is intended for the benefit of, and shall be enforceable by,
the Seller Group Law Firm. This Section shall be irrevocable, and no term of
this Section may be amended, waived or modified, without the prior written
consent of the Seller Group Law Firm.

 



      
 

 



 

SECTION 8.16 _Shareholder Representative_.

 



 

(a) By adoption of this Agreement, execution or submission of a Form of
Election or the acceptance of any portion of the Merger Consideration, each
Company Holder hereby designates the Shareholder Representative to execute any
and all instruments or other documents on behalf of such Company Holder, and
to do any and all other acts or things on behalf of such Company Holder, which
the Shareholder Representative may deem necessary or advisable, or which may
be required pursuant to this Agreement, the Ancillary Agreements or otherwise,
in connection with the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby or
thereby and the performance of all obligations hereunder or thereunder at or
following the Closing, including, but not limited to, the exercise of the
power to: (i) execute the Ancillary Agreements on behalf of each Company
Holder; (ii) act for each Company Holder with respect to any the Ancillary
Agreements; (iii) give and receive notices and communications to or from the
Parent relating to this Agreement, the Ancillary Agreements or any of the
transactions and other matters contemplated hereby or thereby (except to the
extent that this Agreement or any Ancillary Agreement expressly contemplates
that any such notice or communication shall be given or received by such
Company Holders individually); (iv) to enforce and protect the rights and
interests of the Company Holders and to enforce and protect the rights and
interests of such Persons arising out of or under or in any manner relating to
this Agreement and the transactions provided for herein, from and after the
Closing; (v) directing the method of payment for any deferred payments owed to
the Company Holders pursuant to Tax Receivables Agreement and coordinating
with Parent with respect thereto; (vi) execute a Section 431 Election, to the
extent applicable; and (vii) take all actions necessary or appropriate in the
judgment of the Shareholder Representative for the accomplishment of the
foregoing. The Shareholder Representative shall have authority and power to
act on behalf of each Company Holder with respect to the disposition,
settlement or other handling of all claims under this Agreement or the
Ancillary Agreements and all rights or obligations arising hereunder or
thereunder. The Company Holders shall be bound by all actions taken and
documents executed by the Shareholders Representative in connection with this
Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements, and the Parent and Surviving NewCo and
any of their affiliates shall be entitled to rely on any action or decision of
the Shareholder Representative. The Shareholder Representative shall receive
no compensation for its services. Notices or communications to or from the
Shareholder Representative shall constitute notice to or from each Company
Holder.

 



 

(b) In performing the functions specified in this Agreement, the Shareholder
Representative shall not be liable to any Company Holder in the absence of
gross negligence or willful misconduct on the part of the Shareholder
Representative. Each Company Holder shall severally (based on each such
Company Holders Pro Rata Share), and not jointly, indemnify and hold harmless
the Shareholder Representative from and against any loss incurred without
gross negligence or willful misconduct on the part of the Shareholder
Representative and arising out of or in connection with the acceptance or
administration of its duties hereunder. The Shareholder Representative may
draw at any time, and from time to time, from the Administrative Expense
Account to pay any amounts due by the Company Holders hereunder, including,
any losses, third-party fees, expenses or costs it incurs in performing its
duties and obligations under this Agreement by or on behalf of the Company
Holders, including, without limitation, legal and consultant fees, expenses
and costs for reviewing, analyzing and defending any claim or process arising
under or pursuant to this Agreement or any Ancillary Agreement (collectively,
" _Administrative Costs_ "). From and after the Closing, if the Shareholder
Representative determines that the amounts in the Administrative Expense
Account are

 



      
 

 



 

insufficient to satisfy current or future (whether realized or potential)
Administrative Costs of the Shareholder Representative, it shall be entitled
to: (x) collect from the Company Holders on a Pro Rata Basis or (y) withhold
on a Pro Rata Basis from amounts otherwise due to the Company Holders under
this Agreement or under any Ancillary Agreement amounts as it deems necessary
to provide for such Administrative Costs. (c) The grant of authority provided
for herein (i) is coupled with an interest and shall be irrevocable and
survive the death, incompetency, bankruptcy or liquidation of any Company
Holder and (ii) shall survive the consummation of the Mergers, and any action
taken by Shareholder Representative pursuant to the authority granted in this
Agreement shall be effective and binding on each Company Holder
notwithstanding any contrary action of or direction from such Company Holder,
except for actions or omissions of Shareholder Representative constituting
willful misconduct.

 



 

(c) The rights and obligations of Shareholder Representative pursuant to this
Agreement, and the grant of authority to the Shareholder Representative set
forth in this _Section 8.16_ may be assigned from time to time upon consent of
the Company Holder representing a majority of the Pro Rata Share; provided,
however, that no such assignment shall be effective unless and until (i)
evidence of the consent referred to in the immediately preceding sentence is
provided to Parent and (ii) the assignee of such rights and obligations
becomes a party to this Agreement by executing a joinder in a form reasonably
acceptable to Parent. Upon any such assignment, the Person accepting and
assuming the rights and obligations of Shareholder Representative shall
become, for all purposes, Shareholder Representative hereunder.

IN WITNESS WHEREOF, each party has caused this Agreement to be signed by its
respective officer thereunto duly authorized, all as of the date first written

RE: _Surrender of Class B Shares and Private Placement Warrants_

 



 

Reference is made to that certain Transaction Agreement (the " _Transaction
Agreement_ "), to be dated as of the date hereof, by and among Envigo
International Holdings, Inc.,, a Delaware corporation (the " _Company_ "),
Avista Healthcare Public Acquisition Corp., a Cayman Islands exempted company
(" _Parent_ "), Avista Healthcare Merger Sub, Inc., a Delaware corporation and
wholly-owned subsidiary of Parent (" _Merger Sub_ "), and Avista Healthcare
NewCo, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company and wholly-owned subsidiary
of Parent (" _NewCo_ "). This letter agreement (this " _Letter Agreement_ ")
is being entered into and delivered by Parent, Avista Acquisition Corp., a
Cayman Islands exempt company (" _Parent Sponsor_ "), and certain directors of
Parent that are signatories hereto (collectively with the Parent Sponsor, the
" _Class B Holders_") in connection with the transactions contemplated by the
Transaction Agreement. Capitalized terms used but not otherwise defined herein
shall have the meanings ascribed to such terms in the Transaction Agreement.

 



 

In consideration of the foregoing and for other good and valuable
consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which are hereby acknowledged,
each of the Class B Holders hereby (a) represents and warrants that the Class
B Holders collectively hold all of the issued and outstanding Private
Placement Warrants and Class B Shares, in each case, as of the date of this
Letter Agreement, (b) agrees that, subject to the satisfaction or waiver of
each of the conditions to Closing set forth in Sections 6.1 and 6.2 of the
Transaction Agreement, and immediately prior to the Domestication, the Class B
Holders shall collectively (pro rata among the Class B Holders) (i) surrender
3,875,000 Class B Shares to Parent for no consideration and (ii) sell to
Parent, and Parent hereby agrees to purchase from the Class B Holders,
4,100,000 Private Placement Warrants for $0.50 per warrant in cash (to be paid
by wire transfer of immediately available funds to an account previously
designated by the applicable Class B Holder to Parent); (c) agrees that, until
the consummation of the transactions contemplated by the Transaction
Agreement, the Class B Holders shall not modify, amend or terminate that
certain Letter Agreement, dated October 10, 2016, by and among the Company and
the Class B Holders, waive or release any claims or rights thereunder or
otherwise consent to any of the foregoing and (d) waives any and all rights
such Class B Holder has or will have under the Parent Organizational Documents
to receive, with respect to each share of Class B common stock of Parent, par
value $0.0001, held by such Class B Holder immediately following the
Domestication, more than one share of Parent Common Stock upon conversion
thereof in accordance with the Parent Organizational Documents. Subject to the
terms and conditions of this Letter Agreement, the Class B Holders agree to
take, or cause to be taken, all actions and to do, or cause to be done, all
things necessary, proper or advisable to consummate and make effective the
transactions contemplated by this Letter Agreement.

      
 

 



 

This Letter Agreement shall terminate, and have no further force and effect,
if the Transaction Agreement is terminated in accordance with its terms prior
to the First Merger Effective Time. This Letter Agreement, and any claim or
cause of action hereunder based upon, arising out of or related to this Letter
Agreement (whether based on law, in equity, in contract, in tort or any other
theory) or the negotiation, execution, performance or enforcement of this
Agreement, shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the Laws of
the State of New York, without giving effect to any principles of conflicts of
law. This Letter Agreement may be executed in two (2) or more counterparts
(including by electronic means), all of which shall be considered one and the
same agreement and shall become effective when signed by each of the parties
and delivered to the other party, it being understood that both parties need
not sign the same counterpart.

taxable income in accordance with managements preexisting projections at such
time (or, in the absence of such preexisting projections, as projected at such
time in good faith by management in a manner consistent with their projections
for other purposes), (ii) the utilization of the NOLs, and Imputed Interest
for each such Taxable Year or future Taxable Years, as applicable, will be
determined based on the Tax laws in effect on such Early Termination Date,

Taxable Year by the Code and other laws in effect on such Early Termination

or local, or U.K. Tax rates are not specified by the Code or other laws as in
effect on such Early Termination Date, such U.S. federal, state, or local, or
U.K. Tax rates that are in effect on such Early Termination Date). For
purposes of clause (i) of this definition, the taxable income projections made

Procedures. Such assumptions shall relate only to the projected income and
loss of the Company and its Subsidiaries (extending the same beyond the years

losses or other tax attributes that might result from acquisitions,
dispositions, recapitalizations or refinancings. For the avoidance of doubt,

Subsidiaries may utilize the NOLs to reduce the amount of Taxes that the
Company or its Subsidiaries would otherwise be required to pay in the future.

 



 

 **Section 2.02** **_Tax Benefit Schedule_**. Within ninety (90) calendar
days after the filing of any Company Return for any Taxable Year, the Company

the calculation of any payment to be made to the Shareholders pursuant to
Article III with respect to such Taxable Year, and (iii) all supporting
information (including work papers and valuation reports) reasonably necessary
to support the calculation of such payment (a " _Tax Benefit Schedule_ "). The
Schedule will become final as provided in Section 2.03(a) and may be amended
as provided in Section 2.03(b) (subject to the procedures set forth in Section
2.03(a)).

 



 

 **Section 2.03** **_Procedures, Amendments_**.

 



 

(a) Procedure. Every time the Company delivers to the Shareholders
Representative an applicable Schedule under this Agreement, including any
Amended Schedule delivered pursuant to Section 2.03(b), and including any
Early Termination Schedule or amended Early Termination Schedule, the Company
shall also (x) deliver to the Shareholders Representative work papers
providing reasonable detail regarding the preparation of the Schedule and an
Advisory Firm Letter with respect to such Schedule and (y) allow the
Shareholders Representative and its advisors reasonable access at no cost to
the appropriate representatives at each of the Company and the Advisory Firm
in connection with a review of such Schedule. The applicable Schedule shall
become final and binding on all parties unless the Shareholders
Representative, within thirty (30) calendar days after receiving any Schedule
or amendment thereto, provides the Company with notice of a material objection
to such Schedule (" _Objection Notice_ ") made in good faith, or unless the
parties agree in writing that such Schedule shall have become final and
binding prior to such 30-day period. If the parties, for any reason, are
unable to successfully resolve the issues raised in any notice within thirty
(30) calendar days of receipt by the Company of such notice, the Company and
the Shareholders Representative shall employ the Reconciliation Procedures.

 



      
 

 



 

(b) Amended Schedule. The Schedule for any Taxable Year shall be amended by
the Company (i) in connection with a Determination affecting such Schedule,
(ii) to correct material inaccuracies in the Schedule identified as a result
of the receipt of additional factual information relating to a Taxable Year
after the date the Schedule was provided to the Shareholders Representative,
(iii) to comply with the Experts determination under the Reconciliation
Procedures, (iv) to reflect a material change (relative to the amounts in the
original Schedule or any prior Amended Schedule) in the U.S. Realized Tax
Benefit or U.K. Realized Tax Benefit for such Taxable Year attributable to a
carryback or carryforward of a loss or other tax item to such Taxable Year, or
(v) to reflect a material change (relative to the amounts in the original
Schedule or any prior Amended Schedule) in the U.S. Realized Tax Benefit or
U.K. Realized Tax Benefit for such Taxable Year attributable to an amended Tax
Return filed for such Taxable Year (such Schedule, an " _Amended Schedule_ ");
_provided_ , _however_ , that such a change under clause (i) attributable to
an audit of a Tax Return by an applicable Taxing Authority shall not be taken
into account on an Amended Schedule unless and until there has been a
Determination with respect to such change. The Company shall provide any
Amended Schedule to the Shareholders Representative within thirty (30)
calendar days of the occurrence of an event referred to in clauses (i) through
(v) of the preceding sentence (or, to the extent such event occurs in
connection with a Company Return filing described in Section 2.02,
concurrently with the delivery of the Tax Benefit Schedule pursuant to Section
2.02) and any such Amended Schedule shall be subject to approval procedures
similar to those described in Section 2.03(a).

 



 

 **Section 2.04** **_Certain Pre-Closing Tax Benefits_**. If the U.K. Group
or the U.S. Group realizes any tax benefit in respect of any U.K. NOL or any
U.S. NOL, as applicable, with respect to any taxable period (or portion
thereof) ending on or prior to the Closing Date as a result of any voluntary
carryback not resulting from a Tax audit adjustment, then the principles of
this Agreement shall apply _mutatis mutandis_ to such pre-closing tax benefit
realized in respect of such pre-closing taxable period.

 



 

 **ARTICLE III 
TAX BENEFIT PAYMENTS**

 



 

 **Section 3.01** **_Payments_**.

 



 

(a) Timing of Payments to the Shareholders. Within five (5) Business Days of
any Tax Benefit Schedule with respect to any Taxable Year becoming final in
accordance with Section 2.03(a), the Company shall pay to each of the
Shareholders the Tax Benefit Payments for such Taxable Year determined
pursuant to Section 3.01(b). Each such Tax Benefit Payment shall be made by
wire transfer of immediately available funds to a bank account previously
designated by the applicable Shareholder to the Company or as otherwise agreed
by the Company and the applicable Shareholder. For the avoidance of doubt, no
Tax Benefit Payment shall be made in respect of estimated tax payments,
including, without limitation, estimated U.S. federal income tax and/or U.K.
corporation tax payments.

 



 

(b) The " _Tax Benefit Payment_ " with respect to any Shareholder means an
amount equal to such Shareholders Applicable Percentage of the Aggregate Tax
Benefit Payment. The " _Aggregate Tax Benefit Payment_ " means an amount, not
less than zero, equal to

 



      
 

 



 

eighty-five percent (85%) of the Net Tax Benefit (as defined below). The "
_Net Tax Benefit_ " with respect to a Taxable Year shall equal (i) the U.S.
Realized Tax Benefit and U.K. Realized Tax Benefit, if any, for such Taxable
Year, plus (ii) for each prior Taxable Year, the excess, if any, of the U.S.
Realized Tax Benefit or U.K. Realized Tax Benefit reflected on an Amended
Schedule delivered during such Taxable Year in respect of such prior Taxable
Year, over the U.S. Realized Tax Benefit or U.K. Realized Tax Benefit, as
applicable, reflected on the original Tax Benefit Schedule for such prior
Taxable Year, minus (iii) for each prior Taxable Year, the excess, if any, of
the U.S. Realized Tax Benefit or U.K. Realized Tax Benefit reflected on the
original Tax Benefit Schedule for such prior Taxable Year, over the U.S.
Realized Tax Benefit or U.K. Realized Tax Benefit, as applicable, reflected on
the Amended Schedule delivered during such Taxable Year in respect of such
previous Taxable Year; _provided_ , _however_ , that to the extent any of the
adjustments described in 3.01(b)(ii) or (iii), above, was previously reflected
in the calculation of the Aggregate Tax Benefit Payment for any prior Taxable
Year, such adjustments shall not be taken into account in determining the
Aggregate Tax Benefit Payment for any subsequent Taxable Year; _provided_ ,
_further_ , that in the case of any Shareholder that is a Shareholder as a
result of being a holder of an Option or Company SAR, such holder shall not be
entitled to receive any ITR Payments made later than the fifth anniversary of
the Closing Date; and _provided_ , _further_ , that for the avoidance of
doubt, the Shareholders shall not be required to return any portion of any
previously made Tax Benefit Payment. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
in this Section 3.01(b), to the extent that (A) a Tax Benefit Payment relates
to U.K. NOLs and the U.S. Group does not have sufficient cash to make such Tax
Benefit Payment without a cash distribution from the U.K. Group (as determined
in good faith by the Board) and (B) such cash distribution from the U.K. Group
to the U.S. Group would result in Repatriation Costs, then (I) at least
fourteen (14) calendar days prior to the date on which such Tax Benefit
Payment is otherwise due and payable, the Company shall give the Shareholders
Representative written notice of the portion of such Tax Benefit Payment that
cannot be made without the incurrence of Repatriation Costs (the " _Affected
Portion_ ") and the amount of such Repatriation Costs (along with a reasonably
detailed description of such items) and (II) at least seven (7) calendar days
prior to the date on which such Tax Benefit Payment is otherwise due and
payable, the Shareholders Representative shall notify the Company in writing
that either (x) the Shareholders Representative elects to receive such
Affected Portion currently, in which case the Company may reduce such Affected
Portion by the amount of such Repatriation Costs or (y) the Shareholders
Representative elects to defer the receipt of the Affected Portion, in which
case such Affected Portion will be deferred until such time as the U.S. Group
has sufficient cash to pay such Affected Portion without a cash distribution
from the U.K. Group (as determined in good faith by the Board) or the U.K.
Group can make a cash distribution to fund any shortfall without the
incurrence of any Repatriation Costs; _provided_ that, if any portion of an
Affected Portion can later be paid by the Company out of available cash (as
determined in good faith by the Board) or through a distribution from the U.K.
Group that can be made without the incurrence of any Repatriation Costs, such
portion shall then become due and payable. Any amount deferred pursuant to the
preceding sentence shall accrue interest at the Agreed Rate, from the date
that such amount originally became due and payable (without regard to the
preceding sentence) through the actual payment date, compounded annually.

 



 

 **Section 3.02** **_No Duplicative Payments; Intent_**. It is intended that
the provisions of this Agreement will not result in duplicative payment of, or
duplicative credit being given in respect of, any amount (including interest)
required under this Agreement. It is also intended

 



      
 

 



 

that, except as specifically provided in the case of a Divestiture or Early
Termination Payment, the provisions of this Agreement provide that eighty-five
percent (85%) of each of the U.S. Realized Tax Benefit and U.K. Realized Tax
Benefit for all years less certain Repatriation Costs (to the extent expressly
provided in Section 3.01(b)) be paid to the Shareholders pursuant to this
Agreement. Such amount shall be determined using a "with and without"
methodology. Carryovers or carrybacks of any tax item shall be considered to
be subject to the rules of the Code (or any successor U.S. federal income tax
statute) and the Treasury Regulations or the appropriate provisions of Tax law
in the relevant jurisdiction, as applicable, governing the use, limitation and
expiration of carryovers or carrybacks of the relevant type. If a carryover or
carryback of any Tax item includes a portion that is attributable to the NOLs
and another portion that is not, such portions shall be considered to be used
in the order determined using such "with and without" methodology. The
provisions of this Agreement shall be construed in the appropriate manner so
that such intentions are realized.

 



 

 **Section 3.03** **_Tax Treatment; Limitation_**.

 



 

(a) The principles of Sections 1272, 1274, or 483 of the Code, as applicable,
and the principles of any similar provision of U.S. state and local law, will
apply to cause a portion of any ITR Payment payable by the Company to a
Shareholder under this Agreement to be treated as imputed interest (" _Imputed
Interest_ "). Except in the case of Shareholders for which payments under this
Agreement are treated as compensatory, the portion of any ITR Payment payable
by the Company to a Shareholder under this Agreement that is not Imputed
Interest shall be treated for U.S. federal, state, local, and non-U.S. income
Tax purposes as additional merger consideration under the Transaction
Agreement that is taxable in the year in which such payment is received (
_i.e._ , "open transaction" treatment shall apply); provided, for the
avoidance of doubt, that nothing in this Section 3.03 shall preclude a
Shareholder, or any direct or indirect owner of a Shareholder, from electing
out of the installment method or making determinations required by applicable
Tax law.

 



 

(b) It is intended that the First Merger and the Second Merger, taken
together, will constitute an integrated plan and qualify as a "reorganization"
within the meaning of Section 368(a)(1)(A) of the Code and pursuant to such
intention, and notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the Agreement, to
the extent that the portion of any ITR Payment that is treated as Boot (as
defined below) would, when taken together with any other merger consideration
paid with respect to Envigo Common Stock under the Transaction Agreement or
this Agreement that is treated as Boot, exceed an amount equal to 60% of the
sum of (x) the fair market value of the Class A Shares to be issued to the
Shareholders (determined by using the Class A Market Value) and (y) the
cumulative amount of cash and other consideration (other than Class A Shares)
paid to the Shareholders pursuant to this Agreement and the Transaction
Agreement (with any Warrants valued by reference to the Class A Market Value),
to the extent treated as Boot, then a portion of such excess cash amount shall
instead be paid to the Shareholders in the form of a number of Class A Shares
(with each such share to be valued at the Class A Market Value) such that the
foregoing percentage does not exceed 60%. For purposes of this _Section
3.03(b)_, the term " _Boot_ " shall mean any merger consideration paid under
the Transaction Agreement or this Agreement with respect to Envigo Common
Stock other than stock of the Company, including, for the avoidance of doubt,
the payment of cash, warrants, and the portion of any Tax Benefit Payment that
is not treated as Imputed Interest.

 



      
 

 



 

(c) For U.S. federal income tax purposes (and for purposes of any applicable
state or local Tax that follows the U.S. federal income tax treatment), the
parties shall prepare and file all Tax Returns consistent with the foregoing
provisions of this Section 3.03 and will not take any inconsistent position on
any Tax Return, or during the course of any audit, litigation or other
proceeding with respect to Taxes, except as otherwise required by applicable
law following a final determination by a court of competent jurisdiction or
good faith administrative settlement with (or final administrative decision
by) the relevant governmental authority.

 



 

(d) Company shall determine after consultation with the Advisory Firm and the
Shareholders Representative the extent to which it is permitted by law to
utilize any NOLs, and such NOLs shall be taken into account in computing the
U.S. Realized Tax Benefit and U.K. Realized Tax Benefit, as applicable, so
long as the Advisory Firm agrees at a "more likely than not" or higher level
of comfort that such utilization is available.

 



 

 **Section 3.04** **_Late Payments by the Company_**. The amount of any
portion of any ITR Payment not made to the Shareholders when due under the
terms of this Agreement shall be payable together with any interest thereon,
computed at the Default Rate and commencing from the date on which such ITR
Payment was due and payable.

 



 

 **ARTICLE IV 
TERMINATION**

 



 

 **Section 4.01** **_Termination_**.

 



 

(a) Termination. This Agreement shall terminate on the date on which all
required ITR Payments have been made under this Agreement.

 



 

(b) Early Termination. Notwithstanding Section 4.01(a), the Company may elect
to terminate this Agreement early by paying to the Shareholders the Early
Termination Payment. Upon payment of the Early Termination Payment, neither
the Company nor any Shareholder shall have any further payment obligations
under this Agreement, other than any (i) ITR Payment agreed to by the Company
and the Shareholders Representative as due and payable but unpaid as of the
Early Termination Notice, and (ii) ITR Payment due for a Taxable Year ending
prior to, with or including the date of the Early Termination Notice (except
to the extent that such amount is included in the Early Termination Payment).

 



 

(c) Breach of Agreement. In the event that the Company breaches any of its
material obligations under this Agreement, whether as a result of a failure to
make any payment when due (as described below), failure to honor any other
material obligation required hereunder or by operation of law as a result of
the rejection of this Agreement in a case commenced under the Bankruptcy Code
or otherwise, then all obligations hereunder shall be accelerated, and such
obligations shall be calculated pursuant to this Article IV as if an Early
Termination Notice had been delivered on the date of such breach and shall
include, but not be limited to, (1) the Early Termination Payment calculated
as if an Early Termination Notice had been delivered on the date of such
breach, (2) any Tax Benefit Payment agreed by the Company and the
Shareholders Representative as due and payable but unpaid as of the Early
Termination Date, and (3) any Tax Benefit Payment due for the Taxable Year
ending prior to, with or including such Early

 



      
 

 



 

Termination Date. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event that the Company
breaches this Agreement, the Shareholders shall be entitled to elect to
receive the amounts set forth in (1), (2) and (3) above or to seek specific
performance of the terms hereof. The parties agree that, subject to Section
6.13, the failure to make any payment due pursuant to this Agreement within
three (3) months of the date such payment is due shall be deemed to be a
breach of a material obligation under this Agreement for all purposes of this
Agreement, and that it will not be considered to be a breach of a material
obligation under this Agreement to make a payment due pursuant to this
Agreement within three (3) months of the date such payment is due; _provided_
, _howeve_ r, that in the event that payment is not made within three (3)
months of the date such payment is due, the Shareholders (through the
Shareholders Representative) shall be required to give written notice to the
Company that the Company has breached its material obligations, and so long as
such payment is made within five (5) Business Days of the delivery of such
notice to the Company, the Company shall no longer be deemed to be in breach
of such material obligation under this Agreement.

 



 

(d) Change of Control. In the event of a Change of Control, all obligations
hereunder shall be accelerated, and such obligations shall be calculated
pursuant to this Article IV as if an Early Termination Notice had been
delivered on the date of the Change of Control and shall include, but not be
limited to, (1) the Early Termination Payment calculated as if an Early
Termination Notice had been delivered on the effective date of the Change of
Control, (2) any ITR Payment agreed to by the Company and the Shareholders
Representative as due and payable but unpaid as of the Early Termination Date,
and (3) any ITR Payment due for any Taxable Year ending prior to, with or
including the Early Termination Date (except to the extent that such amount is
included in the Early Termination Payment). No later than three (3) months
after such Change of Control, the Company shall deliver to the Shareholders
Representative an Early Termination Schedule (which, for the avoidance of
doubt, shall be deemed to have been delivered on the date of the Change of
Control), and the Shareholders Representative shall have thirty (30) calendar
days after actually receiving the Early Termination Schedule to provide the
Company with an Objection Notice in accordance with the procedures set forth
in Section 4.02, below. In the event of a Change of Control, the Early
Termination Payment shall be calculated utilizing the Valuation Assumptions,
substituting in each case the phrase "effective date of a Change of Control"
for the phrase "Early Termination Date."

 



 

(e) Divestiture Acceleration Payment. In the event of a Divestiture, the
Company shall pay to the Shareholders the Divestiture Acceleration Payment
with respect to such Divestiture, which shall be calculated utilizing the
Valuation Assumptions.

 



 

 **Section 4.02** **_Early Termination Notice_**. If the Company chooses to
exercise its right of early termination under Section 4.01(b), above, the
Company shall deliver to the Shareholders Representative notice of such
intention to exercise such right (an " _Early Termination Notice_ ") and a
schedule (the " _Early Termination Schedule_ ") specifying the Companys
intention to exercise such right and showing in reasonable detail the
information required pursuant to Section 2.02 and the calculation of the Early
Termination Payment. The decision for the Company to exercise its rights of
early termination under Section 4.01(b), above, shall be valid only upon the
adoption and approval of a special resolution by the Board (such approval for
these purposes shall require a vote in favor of such action by a majority of
the Companys independent directors) authorizing the Company to exercise its
right of early

 



      
 

 



 

termination under Section 4.01(b), above. The Early Termination Payment shall
become final and binding on all parties unless the Shareholders
Representative, within thirty (30) calendar days after receiving the Early
Termination Schedule, provides the Company with an Objection Notice. If the
parties, for any reason, are unable to successfully resolve the issues raised
in such Objection Notice within thirty (30) calendar days after receipt by the
Company of the Objection Notice, the Company and the Shareholders
Representative shall employ the Reconciliation Procedures.

 



 

 **Section 4.03** **_Payment Upon Early Termination or Divestiture_**.

 



 

(a) Within five (5) Business Days after agreement is reached between the
Shareholders Representative and the Company concerning the Early Termination
Schedule, the Company shall pay to each Shareholder its share (based on such
Shareholders Applicable Percentage) of an amount equal to the Early
Termination Payment. Such payment shall be made by wire transfer of
immediately available funds to a bank account designated by the Shareholders,
or as otherwise agreed by the Company and the Shareholders.

 



 

(b) The " _Early Termination Payment_ " means, as of the date of the delivery
of an Early Termination Schedule, the present value, discounted at the Early
Termination Rate as of such date, of all Tax Benefit Payments that would be
required to be paid by the Company to the Shareholders from and after the
Early Termination Date, assuming the Valuation Assumptions are applied. For
purposes of calculating, pursuant to this Section 4.03(b), the present value
of all Tax Benefit Payments that would be required to be paid, it shall be
assumed that, absent the Early Termination Notice, all Tax Benefit Payments
would be paid on the due date (without extensions) for filing the relevant Tax
Return with respect to such Taxes for each Taxable Year. The computation of
the Early Termination Payment is subject to the Reconciliation Procedures.

 



 

(c) The " _Divestiture Acceleration Payment_ " means, as of the date of any
Divestiture, the present value, discounted at the Early Termination Rate as of
such date, of all Tax Benefit Payments resulting solely from the Transferred
NOLs that would be required to be paid by the Company to the Shareholders from
and after the date of such Divestiture assuming the Valuation Assumptions are
applied, provided that the Divestiture Acceleration Payment shall be
calculated without giving effect to any limitation on the use of the
Transferred NOLs resulting from the Divestitures. For purposes of calculating
the present value pursuant to this Section 4.03(c) of all Tax Benefit Payments
that would be required to be paid, it shall be assumed that, absent the
Divestiture, all Tax Benefit Payments would be paid on the due date (without
extensions) for filing the relevant Tax Return with respect to such Taxes for
each Taxable Year. The computation of the Divestiture Acceleration Payment is
subject to the Reconciliation Procedures.

 



 

 **ARTICLE V 
COMPANY TAX MATTERS; CONSISTENCY; COOPERATION**

 



 

 **Section 5.01** **_Shareholders  Representative Participation in Company
Tax Matters_**. Except as otherwise provided herein, the Company shall have
full responsibility for, and sole discretion over, all Tax matters concerning
the Company and its Subsidiaries including without limitation the preparation,
filing or amending of any Tax Return and defending, contesting or

 



      
 

 



 

settling any issue pertaining to Taxes, subject to a requirement that the
Company act in good faith in connection with its control of any matter which
is reasonably expected to affect the Shareholders rights and obligations
under this Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company shall act in
good faith with respect to the foregoing and will not take any action, or
authorize or permit any of its Affiliates to take any action, primarily for
the purpose of reducing the amount of any ITR Payment or delaying the timing
of any ITR Payment, including making any material change in accounting
policies or practices (except for any such change required by GAAP or by
applicable Tax law). Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company shall notify
the Shareholders Representative of, and keep the Shareholders Representative
reasonably informed with respect to, the portion of any audit of the Company
by a Taxing Authority the outcome of which is reasonably expected to affect
the Shareholders rights and obligations under this Agreement, and shall give
the Shareholders Representative reasonable opportunity to provide information
and participate in the applicable portion of such audit.

 



 

 **Section 5.02** **_Consistency_**. Except upon the written advice of an
Advisory Firm, the Company shall report and cause to be reported for all
purposes, including U.S. federal, state, local and non-U.S. tax purposes and
financial reporting purposes, all Tax-related items (including without
limitation the Tax Benefit Payments) in a manner consistent with that
specified by the Company in any Schedule or statement provided or required to
be provided by or on behalf of the Company under this Agreement or under
applicable Tax law. If any advice of an Advisory Firm described above is
inconsistent with any treatment specified by the Company in any Schedule or
statement described above, the Company shall promptly notify the Shareholders
Representative and any dispute concerning such advice shall be subject to the
Reconciliation Procedures; _provided_ , _however_ , that only the
Shareholders Representative shall have the right to object to such advice
pursuant to this Section 5.02. In the event that an Advisory Firm is replaced
with another firm acceptable to the Company and the Shareholders
Representative pursuant to the definition of "Advisory Firm _,_ " such
replacement Advisory Firm shall be required to perform its services under this
Agreement using procedures and methodologies consistent with those used by the
previous Advisory Firm, unless otherwise required by law (or the Company and
the Shareholders Representative agree to the use of other procedures and
methodologies).

 



 

 **Section 5.03** **_Cooperation_**. Each of the Company, on the one hand,
and the Shareholders Representative, on the other hand, shall (a) furnish to
the other party in a timely manner such information, documents and other
materials in its possession as the other party may reasonably request for
purposes of making or approving any determination or computation necessary or
appropriate under this Agreement, preparing any Tax Return or contesting or
defending any audit, examination or controversy with any Taxing Authority, (b)
make itself available to the other party and its representatives to provide
explanations of documents and materials and such other information as the
requesting party or its representatives may reasonably request in connection
with any of the matters described in clause (a) above, and (c) reasonably
cooperate in connection with any such matter, and the requesting party shall
reimburse the other party for any reasonable third-party costs and expenses
incurred pursuant to this Section 5.03.

shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of
New York, without giving effect to the principles of conflicts of law thereof.

 



 

 **Section 6.05** **_Severability_**. If any term or other provision of this
Agreement is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced by any law or
public policy, all other terms and provisions of this Agreement shall

possible.

 



 

 **Section 6.06** **_Successors; Assignment; Amendments; Waivers_**.

 



 

(a) The Shareholders Representative may not assign this Agreement to any
person; _provided_ , _however_ , that the Shareholders Representative may
assign this Agreement to any of its Affiliates, permitted successors or
replacements under the Transaction Agreement, as long as such transferee has
executed and delivered, or, in connection with such transfer, executes and
delivers, a joinder to this Agreement, in form and substance reasonably
satisfactory to the Company agreeing to be bound by all provisions of this
Agreement and acknowledging specifically the last sentence of Section 6.06(c).

 



 

(b) No Shareholder may transfer this Agreement or its rights to ITR Payments
under this Agreement; _provided_ , that any Shareholder may transfer this
Agreement and its rights to ITR Payments under this Agreement to its direct or
indirect owners or other Affiliates or, with the prior written consent of the
Shareholders Representative (which may be granted or withheld in the sole
discretion of the Shareholders Representative), to other Shareholders or
their direct or indirect owners or other Affiliates.

 



 

(c) The Company may not assign this Agreement to any person.

 



 

(d) No provision of this Agreement may be amended unless such amendment is

whom the waiver is to be effective.

 



 

(e) All of the terms and provisions of this Agreement shall be binding upon,
shall inure to the benefit of and shall be enforceable by the parties hereto
and their respective

representatives. The Company shall require and cause any direct or indirect
successor (whether by purchase, merger, consolidation or otherwise) to all or

manner and to the same extent that the Company would be required to perform if
no such succession had taken place.

 



 

 **Section 6.07** **_Titles and Subtitles_**. The titles of the sections and
subsections of this Agreement are for convenience of reference only and are
not to be considered in construing this Agreement.

 



 

 **Section 6.08** **_Resolution of Disputes_**.

 



 

(a) Any and all disputes which cannot be settled amicably, including any
ancillary claims of any party, arising out of, relating to or in connection
with the validity, negotiation, execution, interpretation, performance or non-
performance of this Agreement (including the validity, scope and
enforceability of this arbitration provision) shall be finally settled by
arbitration conducted by a single arbitrator in accordance with the CPR Rules
for Non-Administered Arbitration then in effect (the " _Rules_ "). The place
of arbitration shall be New York, New York. The parties shall jointly select a
single arbitrator who shall have the authority to hold hearings and to render
a decision in accordance with the Rules. If the parties to the dispute fail to
agree on the selection of an arbitrator within thirty (30) calendar days of
the receipt of the request for arbitration, the arbitrator shall be selected
by the CPR. The arbitrator shall be a former judge. The arbitration shall be
governed by the Federal Arbitration Act, 9 U.S.C. Section 1, et seq., and
judgment on the award may be entered by any court having jurisdiction thereof.

 



 

Performance under this Agreement shall continue if reasonably possible during
any arbitration proceedings.

 



 

(b) Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph (a), either party may bring an
action or special proceeding in a court of competent jurisdiction in
accordance with Section 6.08(c) solely for the purpose of compelling a party

 **Section 6.09** **_Reconciliation_**. Notwithstanding the provisions of
Section 6.08, in the event that the Company and the Shareholders
Representative are unable to resolve a disagreement with respect to the
matters governed by this Agreement within the relevant period designated in
this Agreement (" _Reconciliation Dispute_ "), the Reconciliation Dispute
shall be submitted for determination to a nationally recognized expert (the "
_Expert_ ") in the particular area of disagreement mutually acceptable to both
parties. The Expert shall be a partner in a nationally recognized accounting
firm or a law firm (other than the Advisory Firm), and the Expert shall not,
and the firm that employs the Expert shall not, have any material relationship
with the Company or any Shareholders Representative or other actual or
potential conflict of interest. If the parties are unable to agree on an
Expert within fifteen (15) days of receipt by the respondent(s) of written
notice of a Reconciliation Dispute, the Expert shall be appointed by the
International Chamber of Commerce Centre for Expertise. The Expert shall
resolve any matter relating to the Early Termination Schedule or an amendment
thereto within thirty (30) calendar days and shall resolve any matter relating
to a Tax Benefit Schedule or an amendment thereto within fifteen (15) calendar
days or as soon thereafter as is reasonably practicable, in each case after
the matter has been submitted to the Expert for resolution. Notwithstanding
the preceding sentence, if the matter is not resolved before any payment that
is the subject of a disagreement is due or any Tax Return reflecting the
subject of a disagreement is due, such payment shall be made on the date
prescribed by this Agreement and such Tax Return may be filed as prepared by
the Company, subject to adjustment or amendment upon resolution. The costs
and expenses relating to the engagement of such Expert or amending any Tax
Return shall be borne by the Company, except as provided in the next sentence.
Each of the Company and the Shareholders Representative shall bear its own
costs and expenses of such proceeding. Any dispute as to whether a dispute is
a Reconciliation Dispute within the meaning of this Section 6.09 shall be
decided by the Expert. The Expert shall finally determine any Reconciliation
Dispute and the determinations of the Expert pursuant to this Section 6.09
shall be binding on the Company and all Shareholders and may be entered and
enforced in any court having jurisdiction.

 



 

 **Section 6.10** **_Withholding_**. Notwithstanding any other provision of
this Agreement (but subject to Section 3.03(a)), the Company shall be entitled
to deduct and withhold, or cause

 



      
 

 



 

to be deducted or withheld, from any payment payable pursuant to this
Agreement such amounts as the Company is required to deduct and withhold with
respect to the making of such payment under any provision of U.S. federal,
state, local or non-U.S. Tax law. To the extent that amounts are so withheld,
such withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as
having been paid to the Shareholder in respect of whom such withholding was
made. Each Shareholder shall promptly provide the Company with any applicable
tax forms and certifications reasonably requested by the Company in connection
with determining whether any such deductions and withholdings are required
under any provision of U.S. federal state, local or non-U.S. tax law.

 



 

 **Section 6.11** **_Affiliated Corporations; Admission of the Company into a
Consolidated Group; Transfers of Corporate Assets_**. If the Company is or
becomes a member of an affiliated or consolidated group of corporations that
files a consolidated income tax return pursuant to Sections 1501 et seq. of
the Code or any corresponding provisions of state, local or non-U.S. law,
other than in a manner that gives rise to a Change in Control: (i) the
provisions of this Agreement relating to the Company shall be applied with
respect to the group as a whole; and (ii) Tax Benefit Payments shall be
computed with reference to the consolidated taxable income of the group as a
whole.

 



 

 **Section 6.12** **_Headings_**. The headings in this Agreement are for
convenience of reference only and shall not limit or otherwise affect the
meaning hereof.

 



 

 **Section 6.13** **_Certain Permitted Payment Deferral_**. For the avoidance
of doubt, no Tax Benefit Payment shall be required to be made by the Company
to the extent that the Company does not have available cash to make such
payment absent a distribution from other members of the U.S. Group or members
of the U.K. Group (as determined in good faith by the Board) and such other
U.S. Group members or U.K. Group members are prohibited, by the terms of then
outstanding indebtedness for borrowed money, from making such required
distributions to the Company; _provided_ , that the Company shall make any
such payment (or portion thereof) as soon as the Company has available cash to
make such payment or portion thereof (as determined in good faith by the
Board) or such distribution (or portion thereof) is no longer prohibited by
the terms of any such outstanding indebtedness. Any Tax Benefit Payment
deferred under this Section 6.13 shall accrue interest at the Agreed Rate,
from the date that such Tax Benefit Payment originally became due and payable
(without regard to this Section 6.13) though the actual payment date,
compounded annually, and such deferred amounts shall not be treated as late
payments or as a breach of any obligation under this Agreement.

 



 

 **Section 6.14** **_Obligations of Holdings_**. If requested by the Company,
Holdings shall promptly distribute to the Company any cash needed by the
Company to make any ITR Payment.

Registration_** "); _provided_ that no Holder (other than the Savanna New

_Savanna New Holder Exclusivity Period_** "). The Company shall, within ten
(10) days of the Companys receipt of the Demand Registration, notify, in
writing, all other Holders of Registrable Securities of such demand, and each
Holder of Registrable Securities who thereafter wishes to include all or a
portion of such Holders Registrable Securities in a Registration pursuant to
a Demand Registration (each such Holder that includes all or a portion of such

Holder_** ") shall so notify the Company, in writing, within five (5) days
after the receipt by the Holder of the notice from the Company; _provided_ ,
that during the Savanna New Holder Exclusivity Period, no Holder other than
the Savanna New Holder shall have the right to include any portion of such
Holders Registrable Securities in a Registration. Upon receipt by the Company
of any such written notification from a Requesting Holder(s) to the Company,
such Requesting Holder(s) shall be entitled to have their Registrable
Securities included in a Registration pursuant to a Demand Registration and
the Company shall effect, as soon

 



      
 

 



 

thereafter as practicable, but not more than forty five (45) days immediately
after the Companys receipt of the Demand Registration, the Registration of
all Registrable Securities requested by the Demanding Holders and Requesting
Holders pursuant to such Demand Registration. Under no circumstances shall the
Company be obligated to effect more than (x) an aggregate of three (3)
Registrations pursuant to a Demand Registration by the Existing Holders under
this _subsection 2.1.1_ with respect to any or all Registrable Securities held
by such Existing Holders and (y) an aggregate of three (3) Registrations
pursuant to a Demand Registration by the New Holders under this _subsection
2.1.1_ with respect to any or all Registrable Securities held by such New
Holders; _provided_ , _however_ , that a Registration shall not be counted for
such purposes unless a Form S-1 or any similar long-form registration
statement that may be available at such time (" ** _Form S-1_**") has become
effective and all of the Registrable Securities requested by the Demanding
Holders and the Requesting Holders to be registered on behalf of the Demanding
Holders and the Requesting Holders in such Form S-1 Registration have been
sold, in accordance with _Section 3.1_. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the
Company shall not be required to give effect to a Demand Registration from a
Demanding Holder if the Company has registered Registrable Securities pursuant
to a Demand Registration from such Demanding Holder (except if such Demanding
Holder is the Savanna New Holder) in the preceding one-hundred and fifty (150)
days.

 



 

2.1.2 _Effective Registration_. Notwithstanding the provisions of _subsection
2.1.1_ above or any other part of this Agreement, a Registration pursuant to a
Demand Registration shall not count as a Registration unless and until (i) the
Registration Statement filed with the Commission with respect to a
Registration pursuant to a Demand Registration has been declared effective by
the Commission and (ii) the Company has complied with all of its obligations
under this Agreement with respect thereto; _provided_ , _further_ , that if,
after such Registration Statement has been declared effective, an offering of
Registrable Securities in a Registration pursuant to a Demand Registration is
subsequently interfered with by any stop order or injunction of the
Commission, federal or state court or any other governmental agency the
Registration Statement with respect to such Registration shall be deemed not
to have been declared effective, unless and until, (i) such stop order or
injunction is removed, rescinded or otherwise terminated, and (ii) a majority-
in-interest of the Demanding Holders initiating such Demand Registration
thereafter affirmatively elect to continue with such Registration and
accordingly notify the Company in writing, but in no event later than five (5)
days, of such election; _provided_ , _further_ , that the Company shall not be
obligated or required to file another Registration Statement until the
Registration Statement that has been previously filed with respect to a
Registration pursuant to a Demand Registration becomes effective or is
subsequently terminated.

 



 

2.1.3 _Underwritten Offering_. Subject to the provisions of _subsection 2.1.5_
and _Section 2.4_ hereof, if a majority-in-interest of the Demanding Holders
so advise the Company as part of their Demand Registration that the offering
of the Registrable Securities pursuant to such Demand Registration shall be in

applicable, the " ** _Maximum Number of Securities_** "), then the Company
shall include in such Underwritten Offering, as follows: (i) first, the
Registrable Securities of the Demanding Holders and, if the Demanding Holders
are Existing Holders, the Requesting Holders that are Existing Holders (if
any) or, if the Demanding Holders are New Holders, the Requesting Holders that

statement that may be available at such time (" ** _Form S-3_**"). Within

request for a Registration on Form S-3, the Company shall register all or such
portion of such Holders Registrable Securities as are specified in such
written request, together with all or such portion of Registrable Securities
of any other Holder or Holders joining in such request as are specified in the
written notification given by such Holder or Holders; _provided_ , _however_ ,
that the Company shall not be obligated to effect any such Registration

offering; or (ii) the Holders of Registrable Securities, together with the
Holders of any other equity securities of the Company entitled to inclusion in
such Registration, propose to sell the Registrable Securities and such other
equity securities (if any) at any aggregate price to the public of less than
$5,000,000.

 



 

2.4 _Restrictions on Registration Rights_. If (A) during the period starting
with the date sixty (60) days prior to the Companys good faith estimate of
the date of the filing of, and ending on a date one hundred and twenty (120)

provided that the Company has delivered written notice to the Holders prior to
receipt of a Demand Registration pursuant to _subsection 2.1.1_ and it
continues to actively employ, in good faith, all reasonable efforts to cause
the applicable Registration Statement to become effective; (B) the Holders
have requested an Underwritten Offering and the Company and the Holders are
unable to obtain the commitment of underwriters to firmly underwrite the
offer; or (C) in the good faith judgment of the Board such Registration would
be seriously detrimental to the Company and the Board concludes as a result
that it is essential to defer the filing of such Registration Statement at
such time, then in each case the Company shall furnish to such Holders a
certificate signed by the Chairman of the Board stating that in the good faith
judgment of the Board it would be seriously detrimental to the Company for
such Registration Statement to be filed in the near future and that it is
therefore essential to defer the filing of such Registration Statement. In
such event, the Company shall have the right to defer such filing for a period
of not more than thirty (30) days; _provided_ , _however_ , that the Company
shall not defer its obligation in this manner more than once in any 12-month
period. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement,
no Registration shall be effected or permitted and no Registration Statement
shall become effective, with respect to any Registrable Securities held by any
applicable Holders, until after the expiration of the Founder Lock-up Period,
the Private Placement Lock-up Period, the New Holder Lock-Up Period, the
Savanna New Holder Three-Month Lock-Up Period or the Savanna New Holder Six-
Month Lock-Up Period, as applicable; _provided_ , _however_ , that this shall
not prevent any Holder from making a Demand Registration or other Registration
hereunder prior to the expiration of such lock-up such that such Registration
Statement is only effective on or after the expiration of the Founder Lock-up
Period, the Private Placement Lock-up Period, the New Holder Lock-Up Period,
the Savanna New Holder Three-Month Lock-Up Period or the Savanna New Holder
Six-Month Lock-Up Period.

soon as practicable after the time of such notice), or until it is advised in
writing by the Company that the use of the Prospectus may be resumed (any such
period, a " ** _Suspension Period_** "). If the filing, initial effectiveness
or continued use of a (including in connection with any Underwritten Offering)
Registration Statement in respect of any Registration at any time would
require the Company to make an Adverse Disclosure or would require the
inclusion in such Registration Statement of financial statements that are
unavailable to the Company for reasons beyond the Companys control, the
Company may, upon giving prompt written notice of such action to the Holders,
delay the filing or initial effectiveness of, or suspend use of (including in
connection with any Underwritten Offering), such Registration Statement for
the shortest period of time, but in no event more than thirty (30) days,
determined in good faith by the Company to be necessary for such purpose (any
such period, a " ** _Blackout Period_** ") and in no event shall (i) the
Company deliver notice of a Blackout Period to the Holders more than two times
in any calendar year (or more than once in a six month period) or (ii)
Blackout Periods be in effect for an aggregate of forty-five (45) days or more
in any calendar year. In the event the Company exercises its rights under the
preceding sentence, the Holders agree to suspend, immediately upon their
receipt of the notice referred to above, their use of the Prospectus relating
to any Registration in connection with any sale or offer to sell Registrable
Securities. The Company shall immediately notify the Holders of the expiration
of any period during which it exercised its rights under this _Section 3.4_.

 



 

3.5 _Reporting Obligations_. As long as any Holder shall own Registrable
Securities, the Company, at all times while it shall be a reporting company
under the Exchange Act, covenants to file timely (or obtain extensions in
respect thereof and file within the applicable grace period) all reports
required to be filed by the Company after the date hereof pursuant to Sections
13(a) or 15(d) of the Exchange Act and to promptly furnish the Holders with
true and complete copies of all such filings (the delivery of which will be
satisfied by the Companys filing of such reports on the Commissions EDGAR
system). The Company further covenants that it shall take such further action
as any Holder may reasonably request, all to the extent required from time to
time to enable such Holder to sell shares of Class A Common Stock held by such
Holder without registration under the Securities Act within the limitation of
the exemptions provided by Rule 144 promulgated under the Securities Act (or
any successor rule promulgated by the Commission), including providing any
legal opinions. Upon the request of any Holder, the Company shall deliver to
such Holder a written certification of a duly authorized officer as to whether
it has complied with such requirements.

 



 

3.6 _Transfer Restrictions_.

 



 

3.6.1 During the New Holder Lock-Up Period, the Savanna New Holder Three-Month
Lock-Up Period or the Savanna New Holder Six-Month Lock-Up Period, as
applicable, no New Holder shall offer, sell, contract to sell, pledge, grant
any option to purchase, make any short sale or otherwise dispose of or
distribute (" ** _Transfer_** ") any shares of Class A Common Stock, any New
Holder Warrants or shares of Class A Common Stock

 



      
 

 



 

issued with respect thereto or any other options or warrants to purchase any
shares of Class A Common Stock or any securities convertible into, exercisable
for, exchangeable for or that represent the right to receive shares of Class A
Common Stock, whether now owned or hereinafter acquired, that is owned
directly by such New Holder (including securities held as a custodian) or with
respect to which such New Holder has beneficial ownership within the rules and
regulations of the Commission (collectively, the " ** _Restricted Shares_**
"); _provided_ , that, for the avoidance of doubt, the foregoing restrictions
shall only apply to (i) the Savanna New Holder Three-Month Lock-Up Restricted
Shares during the Savanna New Holder Three-Month Lock-Up Period and (ii) the
Savanna New Holder Six-Month Lock-Up Restricted Shares during the Savanna New
Holder Six-Month Lock-Up Period. The foregoing restriction is expressly agreed
to preclude each New Holder from engaging in any hedging or other transaction
which is designed to or which reasonably could be expected to lead to or
result in a sale or disposition of the Restricted Shares even if such
Restricted Shares would be disposed of by someone other than such New Holder.
Such prohibited hedging or other transactions include any short sale or any
purchase, sale or grant of any right (including any put or call option) with
respect to any of the Restricted Shares of the applicable New Holder or with
respect to any security that includes, relates to, or derives any significant
part of its value from such Restricted Shares.

 



 

3.6.2 Each New Holder hereby represents and warrants that it now has, and,
except as contemplated by this _subsection 3.6.2_ , for the duration of the
New Holder Lock-Up Period, the Savanna New Holder Three-Month Lock-Up Period
or the Savanna New Holder Six-Month Lock-Up Period, as applicable, will have,
good and marketable title to its Restricted Shares, free and clear of all
liens, encumbrances, and claims that could impact the ability of such New
Holder to comply with the foregoing restrictions. Each New Holder agrees and
consents to the entry of stop transfer instructions with the Companys
transfer agent and registrar against the transfer of any Restricted Shares
during the New Holder Lock-Up Period, the Savanna New Holder Three-Month Lock-
Up Period or the Savanna New Holder Six-Month Lock-Up Period, as applicable,
except in compliance with the foregoing restrictions.

Transfer Restricted Shares, Founder Stock or Private Placement Warrants
(including shares of Class A Common Stock issued in exchange thereof) prior to
the expiration of the applicable lock-up period to (a) an Affiliate of such
Holder or, in the case of a Holder who is a natural person, such Holders
Family Group, (b) in the case of an entity, to its direct or indirect
beneficial owners in accordance with their pro rata ownership share in such

reasonably satisfactory to the Company whereby such transferee shall agree to
be bound by the terms of this Agreement and shall thereupon be deemed an

 **ARTICLE IV** ** 
INDEMNIFICATION AND CONTRIBUTION**

 



 

4.1 _Indemnification_.

 



 

4.1.1 The Company agrees to indemnify, to the extent permitted by law, each
Holder of Registrable Securities, their affiliates and their respective
officers, directors, employees and partners and each person who is a
"controlling person" such Holder (within the meaning of the Securities Act)
against, and pay and reimburse such persons for all losses, claims, damages,
liabilities and expenses (including attorneys fees) caused by any untrue or
alleged untrue statement of material fact contained in any Registration
Statement, Prospectus or preliminary Prospectus or any amendment thereof or
supplement thereto or any omission or alleged omission of a material fact
required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not
misleading, except insofar as the same are caused by or contained in any
information furnished in writing to the Company by such Holder expressly for
use therein and the Company will pay and reimburse any Holder and each such
affiliate, director, officer, employee, partner and controlling person for any
legal or any other expenses actually and reasonably incurred by them in
connection with investigating, defending or settling any such loss, claim,
liability, action or proceeding. The Company shall indemnify the Underwriters,
their officers and directors and each person who controls such Underwriters
(within the meaning of the Securities Act) to the same extent as provided in
the foregoing with respect to the indemnification of the Holder or as is
reasonable and customary in an underwritten offering.

 



      
 

 



 

4.1.2 In connection with any Registration Statement in which a Holder of
Registrable Securities is participating, such Holder shall furnish to the
Company in writing such information and affidavits as the Company reasonably
requests for use in connection with any such Registration Statement or
Prospectus and, to the extent permitted by law, shall indemnify the Company,
its directors and officers and agents and each person who controls the Company
(within the meaning of the Securities Act) against any losses, claims,
damages, liabilities and expenses (including without limitation reasonable
attorneys fees) resulting from any untrue statement of material fact
contained in the Registration Statement, Prospectus or preliminary Prospectus
or any amendment thereof or supplement thereto or any omission of a material
fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein
not misleading, but only to the extent that such untrue statement or omission
is contained in any information or affidavit so furnished in writing by such
Holder expressly for use therein; _provided_ , _however_ , that the obligation
to indemnify shall be several, not joint and several, among such Holders of
Registrable Securities, and the liability of each such Holder of Registrable
Securities shall be in proportion to and limited to the net proceeds received
by such Holder from the sale of Registrable Securities pursuant to such
Registration Statement. The Holders of Registrable Securities shall indemnify
the Underwriters, their officers, directors and each person who controls such
Underwriters (within the meaning of the Securities Act) to the same extent as
provided in the foregoing with respect to indemnification of the Company.

 



 

4.1.3 Any person entitled to indemnification herein shall (i) give prompt
written notice to the indemnifying party of any claim with respect to which it
seeks indemnification (provided that the failure to give prompt notice shall
not impair any persons right to indemnification hereunder to the extent such
failure has not materially prejudiced the indemnifying party) and (ii) unless
in such indemnified partys reasonable judgment a conflict of interest between
such indemnified and indemnifying parties may exist with respect to such
claim, permit such indemnifying party to assume the defense of such claim with
counsel reasonably satisfactory to the indemnified party. If such defense is
assumed, the indemnifying party shall not be subject to any liability for any
settlement made by the indemnified party without its consent (but such consent
shall not be unreasonably withheld). An indemnifying party who is not entitled
to, or elects not to, assume the defense of a claim shall not be obligated to
pay the fees and expenses of more than one counsel for all parties indemnified
by such indemnifying party with respect to such claim, unless in the
reasonable judgment of any indemnified party a conflict of interest may exist
between such indemnified party and any other of such indemnified parties with
respect to such claim. No indemnifying party shall, without the consent of the
indemnified party, consent to the entry of any judgment or enter into any
settlement unless (i) such settlement is to be settled in all respects by the
payment of money (and such money is so paid by the indemnifying party pursuant
to the terms of such settlement) (ii) such settlement includes as an
unconditional term thereof the giving by the claimant or plaintiff to such
indemnified party of a release from all liability in respect to such claim or
litigation and (iii) such settlement does not include an admission of fault by
such indemnified party.

 



 

4.1.4 The indemnification provided for under this Agreement shall remain in
full force and effect regardless of any investigation made by or on behalf of
the indemnified party or any officer, director or controlling person of such
indemnified party and shall survive the transfer of securities. The Company
and each Holder of Registrable Securities participating in an offering also
agrees to make such provisions as are reasonably requested by any indemnified
party for contribution to such party in the event the Companys or such
Holders indemnification is unavailable for any reason.

 



 

4.1.5 If the indemnification provided under _Section 4.1_ hereof from the
indemnifying party is unavailable or insufficient to hold harmless an
indemnified party in respect of any losses, claims, damages, liabilities and
expenses referred to herein, then the indemnifying party, in lieu of
indemnifying the indemnified party, shall contribute to the amount paid or
payable by the indemnified party as a result of such losses, claims, damages,
liabilities and expenses in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the
relative fault of the indemnifying party and the indemnified party, as well as
any other relevant equitable considerations. The relative fault of the
indemnifying party and indemnified party shall be determined by reference to,
among other things, whether any action in question, including any untrue or
alleged untrue statement of a material fact or omission or alleged omission to
state a material fact, was made by, or relates to information supplied by,
such indemnifying party or indemnified party, and the indemnifying partys and
indemnified partys relative intent, knowledge, access to information and
opportunity to correct or prevent such action; _provided_ , _however_ , that
the liability of any Holder under this _subsection 4.1.5_ shall be limited to
the amount of the net proceeds received by such Holder in such offering giving
rise to such liability. The amount paid or payable by a party as a result of
the losses or other liabilities referred to above shall be deemed

 



      
 

 



 

to include, subject to the limitations set forth in _subsections 4.1.1_ ,
_4.1.2_ and _4.1.3_ above, any legal or other fees, charges or expenses
reasonably incurred by such party in connection with any investigation or
proceeding. The parties hereto agree that it would not be just and equitable
if contribution pursuant to this _subsection 4.1.5_ were determined by pro
rata allocation or by any other method of allocation, which does not take
account of the equitable considerations referred to in this _subsection
4.1.5_. No person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning
of Section 11(f) of the Securities Act) shall be entitled to contribution
pursuant to this _subsection 4.1.5_ from any person who was not guilty of such
fraudulent misrepresentation.

5.4 _Governing Law; Venue_. NOTWITHSTANDING THE PLACE WHERE THIS AGREEMENT MAY
BE EXECUTED BY ANY OF THE PARTIES HERETO, THE PARTIES EXPRESSLY AGREE THAT
THIS AGREEMENT SHALL BE GOVERNED BY AND CONSTRUED UNDER THE LAWS OF THE STATE
OF NEW YORK AS APPLIED TO AGREEMENTS AMONG NEW YORK RESIDENTS ENTERED INTO AND
TO BE PERFORMED ENTIRELY WITHIN NEW YORK, WITHOUT REGARD TO THE CONFLICT OF
LAW PROVISIONS OF SUCH JURISDICTION. ANY LEGAL SUIT, ACTION OR PROCEEDING
ARISING OUT OF OR BASED UPON THIS AGREEMENT OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED
HEREBY MAY BE INSTITUTED IN THE FEDERAL COURTS OF THE UNITED STATES OR THE
COURTS OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK IN EACH CASE LOCATED IN THE CITY OF NEW YORK,
AND EACH PARTY IRREVOCABLY SUBMITS TO THE EXCLUSIVE JURISDICTION OF SUCH
COURTS IN ANY SUCH SUIT, ACTION OR PROCEEDING.

 



 

5.5 _Amendments and Modifications_. Upon the written consent of (i) the
Company and (ii) Holders of at least a majority-in-interest of the Registrable
Securities held by the Holders at the time in question at the time in
question, compliance with any of the provisions, covenants and conditions set
forth in this Agreement may be waived, or any of such provisions, covenants or
conditions may be amended or modified; _provided_ , _however_ , that
notwithstanding the foregoing, any amendment hereto or waiver hereof that
adversely affects either the Existing Holders as a group, the New Holders as

the Registrable Securities held by such Existing Holders, a majority-in-
interest of the Registerable Securities held by such New Holders or the
Savanna New Holder, as applicable, at the time in question so affected,
_provided_ , _further_ , that notwithstanding the foregoing, any amendment

shall require the consent of the Holder so affected. No course of dealing
between any Holder or the Company and any other party hereto or any failure or
delay on the part of a Holder or the Company in exercising any rights or
remedies under this Agreement shall operate as a waiver of any rights or
remedies of any Holder or the Company. No single or partial exercise of any
rights or remedies under this Agreement by a party shall operate as a waiver
or preclude the exercise of any other rights or remedies hereunder or
thereunder by such party.

include such securities of the Company in any Registration filed by the
Company for the sale of securities for its own account or for the account of
any other person. Further, the Company represents and warrants that this
Agreement supersedes any other registration rights agreement or agreement with
similar terms and conditions and in the event of a conflict between any such
agreement or agreements and this Agreement, the terms of this Agreement shall
prevail. The Company agrees that it will not enter into, any agreement with
respect to its securities that violates or subordinates or is otherwise
inconsistent with the rights granted to the Holders of Registrable Securities
under this Agreement without the written consent of a majority-in-interest of
the Registrable Securities held by the Holders at the time in question. For
the term of this Agreement, the Company shall not grant to any Person the
right to require the Company to register any equity securities of the Company,
or any securities convertible or exchangeable into or exercisable for such
securities, without written consent of the majority-in-interest of the
Holders, unless such rights are explicitly made subordinate to all rights
granted hereunder.

 



 

5.7 _Term_. This Agreement shall terminate upon the earlier of (i) the tenth
anniversary of the date of this Agreement or (ii) the date as of which (A) all
of the Registrable Securities have been sold pursuant to a Registration

Section 4(a)(3) of the Securities Act and Rule 174 thereunder) or (B) the
Holders of all Registrable Securities are permitted to sell the Registrable
Securities under Rule 144 (or any similar provision) under the Securities Act
without limitation on the amount of securities sold or the manner of sale. The
provisions of _Section 3.5_ and _Article IV_ shall survive any termination.

 



 

5.8 _Interpretation_. The words " ** _include_** ," " ** _includes_** " and "
** _including_** " when used herein shall be deemed in each case to be
followed by the words " ** _without limitation_**." The word " ** _herein_** "
and similar references mean, except where a specific Section or Article
reference is expressly indicated, the entire Agreement rather than any
specific Section or Article. The table of contents and the headings contained
in this Agreement are for reference

this Agreement. Unless expressly indicated otherwise in this Agreement, all

FORM OF CERTIFICATE OF INCORPORATION

 



 

 **CERTIFICATE OF INCORPORATION 
OF**

 

 **AVISTA HEALTHCARE PUBLIC ACQUISITION CORP.**

 



 

I, the undersigned, for the purposes of incorporating and organizing a
corporation under the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware (the
"DGCL"), do execute this certificate of incorporation and do hereby certify as
follows:

 



 

 ** _ARTICLE I_**

 



 

1.1 _Name._ The name of the Corporation is:

 



 

Avista Healthcare Public Acquisition Corp.

 



 

 ** _ARTICLE II_**

 



 

2.1 _Address._ The address of the Corporations registered office in the
State of Delaware is 2711 Centerville Road, Suite 400, Wilmington, County of
New Castle, Delaware 19808. The name of its registered agent for service of
process in the State of Delaware at such address is Corporation Service
Company.

 



 

 ** _ARTICLE III_**

 



 

3.1 _Purpose._ The purpose of the Corporation is to engage in any lawful
act or activity for which corporations may be organized and incorporated under
the DGCL. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the Corporation
shall have all of the powers conferred on corporations by the DGCL and other
applicable law. The Corporation is being incorporated in connection with the
domestication of Avista Healthcare Public Acquisition Corp., a Cayman Islands
exempted company (" _Avista Healthcare Cayman_ "), as a Delaware corporation
(the " _Domestication_ "), and this Certificate of Incorporation is being
filed simultaneously with the Certificate of Corporate Domestication of Avista
Healthcare Cayman.

 



 

 ** _ARTICLE IV_**

 



 

4.1 _Authorized Shares_. The total number of shares of all classes of
capital stock, each with a par value of $0.0001 per share, which the
Corporation is authorized to issue is 221,000,000 shares, consisting of (a)
220,000,000 shares of common stock (" _Common Stock_ "), including (i)
200,000,000 shares of Class A Common Stock (" _Class A Common Stock_") and
(ii) 20,000,000 shares of Class B Common Stock (" _Class B Common Stock_");
and (b) 1,000,000 shares of preferred stock (" _Preferred Stock_ "). Upon the
effectiveness of the Domestication (the " _Effective Time_ "), any stock
certificate that, immediately prior to the Effective Time, represented
Original Class A Shares or Original Class B Shares will, from and after the
Effective Time, automatically and without the necessity of presenting the same
for exchange, represented an identical number of shares of Class A Common
Stock and Class B Common Stock of the Corporation. Notwithstanding anything to
the contrary contained herein, the rights and preferences of the Common Stock
shall at all times be subject to the rights and preferences of the Preferred
Stock as may be set forth in one or more certificates of designations filed
with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware from time to time in
accordance with the DGCL and

      
 

 



 

this Certificate. The number of authorized shares of Preferred Stock and
Common Stock may be increased or decreased (but not below the number of shares
thereof then outstanding) from time to time by the affirmative vote of the
holders of at least a majority of the voting power of the Corporations then
outstanding shares of stock entitled to vote thereon, voting together as a
single class, irrespective of the provisions of Section 242(b)(2) of the DGCL
(or any successor provision thereto), and no vote of the holders of any of the
Common Stock or the Preferred Stock voting separately as a class or series
shall be required therefor.

 



 

4.2 _Common Stock._ The Common Stock shall have the following powers,
designations, preferences and rights and qualifications, limitations and
restrictions:

 



 

(a) _Voting._ Each holder of record of shares of Common Stock shall be
entitled to vote at all meetings of the stockholders of the Corporation and
shall have one vote for each share of Common Stock held of record by such
holder of record as of the applicable record date on any matter that is
submitted to a vote of the stockholders of the Corporation; provided, however,
that to the fullest extent permitted by law, holders of Common Stock, as such,
shall have no voting power with respect to, and shall not be entitled to vote
on, any amendment to this Certificate (including any certificate of
designations relating to any series or class of Preferred Stock) that relates
solely to the terms of one or more outstanding series or class(es) of
Preferred Stock if the holders of such affected series or class(es) of
Preferred Stock are entitled, either separately or together with the holders
of one or more other such series or class(es), to vote thereon pursuant to
applicable law or this Certificate (including any certificate of designations
relating to any series or class of Preferred Stock); and provided further that
the Board of Directors may issue or grant shares of Common Stock that are
subject to vesting or forfeiture and that restrict or eliminate voting rights
with respect to such shares until any such vesting criteria is satisfied or
such forfeiture provisions lapse.

 



 

(b) _Dividends and Distributions._ Subject to the prior rights of all
classes or series of stock at the time outstanding having prior rights as to
dividends or other distributions, the holders of shares of Common Stock shall
be entitled to receive such dividends and other distributions in cash,
property, or stock as may be declared on the Common Stock by the Board of
Directors from time to time out of assets or funds of the Corporation legally
available therefor and shall share equally on a per share basis in all such
dividends and other distributions.

 



 

(c) _Liquidation, etc._ Subject to the prior rights of creditors of the
Corporation and the holders of all classes or series of stock at the time
outstanding having prior rights as to distributions upon liquidation,
dissolution or winding up of the Corporation, in the event of any liquidation,
dissolution or winding up of the Corporation, either voluntary or involuntary,
the holders of shares of Common Stock shall be entitled to receive their
ratable and proportionate share of the remaining assets of the Corporation.

 



 

(d) No holder of shares of Common Stock shall have cumulative voting rights.

 



 

(e) No holder of shares of Common Stock shall be entitled to preemptive or
subscription rights pursuant to this Certificate.

 



      
 

 



 

4.3 _Class B Common Stock_

 



 

(a) On the first business day following the consummation of the Business
Combination, the issued and outstanding shares of Class B Common Stock shall
automatically be converted into shares of Class A Common Stock on a one-for-
one basis; _provided_ , _however_ , in the case that additional shares of
Class A Common Stock or any other equity-linked securities are issued or
deemed issued in excess of the amount sold in the IPO and related to or in
connection with the consummation of the Business Combination, all issued and
outstanding shares of Class B Common Stock shall automatically convert into
shares of Class A Common Stock at a ratio for which:

 



 

(i) the numerator shall be equal to the sum of (A) 25% of all shares of Class
A Common Stock issued or issuable (upon the conversion or exercise of any
equity-linked securities or otherwise) by the Corporation, related to or in
connection with the consummation of the Business Combination (excluding any
securities issued or issuable to any seller in the Business Combination) plus
(B) the number of shares of Class B Common Stock issued and outstanding prior
to the consummation of the Business Combination; and

 



 

(ii) the denominator shall be the number of shares of Class B Common Stock
issued and outstanding prior to the closing of the Business Combination.

 



 

(b) The foregoing conversion ratio shall also be adjusted to account for any
subdivision (by share split, subdivision, exchange, share dividend, rights
issue, reclassification, recapitalization or otherwise) or combination (by
reverse share split, share consolidation, exchange, reclassification,
recapitalization or otherwise) or similar reclassification or recapitalization
of the issued and outstanding shares of Class A Common Stock into a greater or
lesser number of shares occurring after October 12, 2016 without a
proportionate and corresponding subdivision, combination or similar
reclassification or recapitalization of the outstanding shares of Class B
Common Stock.

 



 

(c) Each share of Class B Common Stock shall convert into its pro rata number
of shares of Class A Common Stock pursuant to this _Section 4.3_. The pro
rata share for each holder of shares of Class B Common Stock will be
determined as follows: each Share of Class B Common Stock shall convert into
such number of shares of Class A Common Stock as is equal to the product of 1
multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which shall be the total number of
shares of Class A Common Stock into which all of the issued and outstanding
shares of Class B Common Stock shall be converted pursuant to this Certificate
and the denominator of which shall be the total number of issued and
outstanding shares of Class B Common Stock at the time of conversion.

 



 

(d) At any time when there are no longer any shares of Class B Common Stock
outstanding, this Certificate automatically shall be deemed amended to delete
this _Section 4.3_ in its entirety.

 



 

(e) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this _Section 4.3_, in no
event may any Share of Class B Common Stock convert into shares of Class A
Common Stock at a ratio that is less than one-for-one.

 



      
 

 



 

4.4 _Preferred Stock_. The Board of Directors is hereby expressly authorized,
to the fullest extent as may now or hereafter be permitted by the DGCL, by
resolution or resolutions, at any time and from time to time, to provide for
the issuance of a share or shares of Preferred Stock in one or more series or
classes and to fix for each such series or class (i) the number of shares
constituting such series or class and the designation of such series or class,
(ii) the voting powers (if any), whether full or limited, of the shares of
such series or class, (iii) the powers, preferences, and relative,
participating, optional or other special rights of the shares of each such
series or class, and (iv) the qualifications, limitations, and restrictions
thereof, and to cause to be filed with the Secretary of State of the State of
Delaware a certificate of designation with respect thereto. Without limiting
the generality of the foregoing, to the fullest extent as may now or hereafter
be permitted by the DGCL, the authority of the Board of Directors with respect
to the Preferred Stock and any series or class thereof shall include, but not
be limited to, determination of the following:

 



 

(a) the number of shares constituting any series or class, which number the
Board of Directors may thereafter increase or decrease (but not below the
number of shares thereof then outstanding) and the distinctive designation of
that series or class;

 



 

(b) the dividend rate or rates on the shares of any series or class, the terms
and conditions upon which and the periods in respect of which dividends shall
be payable, whether dividends shall be cumulative and, if so, from which date
or dates, and the relative rights of priority, if any, of payment of dividends
on shares of that series or class;

 



 

(c) whether any series or class shall have voting rights, in addition to the

applicable law, the Corporation shall have the power to issue and sell all or
any part of any shares of any class of stock herein or hereafter authorized to

law. Subject to the requirements of applicable law, the Corporation shall
have the power to purchase any shares of any class of stock herein or
hereafter authorized from such persons, and for such consideration and for
such corporate purposes, as the Board of Directors shall from time to time, in
its discretion, determine, whether or not less consideration could be paid

otherwise permitted by law.

 



 

 ** _ARTICLE V_**

 



 

5.1 _[RESERVED.]_

 



 

 ** _ARTICLE VI_**

 



 

6.1 _Powers of the Board._ The business and affairs of the Corporation shall
be managed by or under the direction of the Board of Directors. In addition
to the powers and authority expressly conferred upon them by applicable law or
by this Certificate (including any certificate of designations relating to any
series or class of Preferred Stock) or the Bylaws of the Corporation (the "
_Bylaws_ "), the Board of Directors is hereby empowered to exercise all such
powers and do all such acts and things as may be exercised or done by the
Corporation, except as otherwise specifically required by law or as otherwise
provided in this Certificate (including any certificate of designations
relating to any series or class of Preferred Stock).

 



 

6.2 _Number of Directors._ Upon the Effective Time, the total number of
directors constituting the entire Board of Directors shall be seven (7).
Thereafter, the total number of directors constituting the entire Board of
Directors shall be such number as may be fixed from time to time exclusively
by resolution adopted by the affirmative vote of at least a majority of the
directors then in office.

 



 

6.3 _Classification._ Subject to the terms of any one or more series or
classes of Preferred Stock, and effective upon the Effective Time, the
directors of the Corporation shall be divided into three classes designated
Class I, Class II and Class III. Each class shall consist, as nearly as may be
possible, of one-third of the total number of directors constituting the
entire Board of Directors. The Board of Directors may assign members of the
Board of Directors already in office to such classes as of the Effective Time.
No director shall be a member of more

 



      
 

 



 

than one class of directors. The term of office of the initial Class I
directors shall expire at the first annual meeting of the stockholders
following the Effective Time; the term of office of the initial Class II
directors shall expire at the second annual meeting of the stockholders
following the Effective Time; and the term of office of the initial Class III
directors shall expire at the third annual meeting of the stockholders
following the Effective Time. At each annual meeting of stockholders,
commencing with the first annual meeting of stockholders following the
Effective Time, successors to the class of directors whose term expires at
that annual meeting shall be elected to hold office until the third annual
meeting next succeeding his or her election and until his or her respective
successor shall have been duly elected and qualified. Directors shall be
elected by a plurality of the votes of the shares present in person or
represented by proxy at a meeting and voting for nominees in the election of
directors. If the number of directors is changed, any increase or decrease
shall be apportioned among the classes in such a manner as the Board of
Directors shall determine so as to maintain the number of directors in each
class as nearly equal as possible, but in no case will a decrease in the
number of directors shorten the term of any incumbent director.

 



 

6.4 _Removal of Directors._ Subject to the terms of any one or more series
or classes of Preferred Stock, any director or the entire Board of Directors
may be removed from office at any time, but only for cause and only by the
affirmative vote of the holders of at least a majority of the voting power of
the Corporations outstanding shares of stock entitled to vote generally in
the election of directors, voting together as a single class. For purposes of
this _Section 6.4_, "cause" shall mean, with respect to any director, (i) the
willful failure by such director to perform, or the gross negligence of such
director in performing, the duties of a director, (ii) the engaging by such
director in willful or serious misconduct that is injurious to the Corporation
or (iii) the conviction of such director of, or the entering by such director
of a plea of _nolo contendere_ to, a crime that constitutes a felony.

 



 

6.5 _Term._ A director shall hold office until the annual meeting for the year
in which his or her term expires and until his or her successor shall be
elected and shall qualify, subject, however, to prior death, resignation,
retirement or removal from office. A director may resign at any time upon
written notice to the Corporation.

 



 

6.6 _Vacancies._ Subject to the terms of any one or more series or classes
of Preferred Stock, any vacancies in the Board of Directors for any reason and
any newly created directorships resulting by reason of any increase in the
number of directors shall be filled only by the Board of Directors (and not by
the stockholders), acting by a majority of the remaining directors then in
office, even if less than a quorum, or by a sole remaining director, and any
directors so appointed shall hold office until the next election of the class
of directors to which such directors have been appointed and until their
successors are duly elected and qualified.

 



 

6.7 _Director Elections by Holders of Preferred Stock._ Notwithstanding the
foregoing, whenever the holders of any one or more series or classes of
Preferred Stock shall have the right, voting separately by series or class, to
elect one or more directors at an annual or special meeting of stockholders,
the election, filling of vacancies, removal of directors and other features of
such one or more directorships shall be governed by the terms of such one or
more series or classes of Preferred Stock to the extent permitted by law.

 



      
 

 



 

6.8 _Officers._ Except as otherwise expressly delegated by resolution of the
Board of Directors, the Board of Directors shall have the exclusive power and
authority to appoint and remove officers of the Corporation.

 



 

 ** _ARTICLE VII_**

 



 

7.1 _Elections of Directors._ Elections of directors need not be by written
ballot except and to the extent provided in the Bylaws of the Corporation.

 



 

7.2 _Advance Notice._ Advance notice of nominations for the election of
directors or proposals of other business to be considered by stockholders,
made other than by the Board of Directors or a duly authorized committee
thereof or any authorized officer of the Corporation to whom the Board of
Directors or such committee shall have delegated such authority, shall be
given in the manner provided in the Bylaws of the Corporation. Without
limiting the generality of the foregoing, the Bylaws may require that such
advance notice include such information as the Board of Directors may deem
appropriate or useful.

 



 

7.3 _No Stockholder Action by Consent._ Subject to the terms of any one or
more series or classes of Preferred Stock, any action required or permitted to
be taken by the stockholders of the Corporation must be effected by a duly
called annual or special meeting of such holders and may not be effected by
written consent of the stockholders.

 



 

7.4 _Postponement, Conduct and Adjournment of Meetings._ Any meeting of
stockholders may be postponed by action of the Board of Directors at any time
in advance of such meeting. The Board of Directors shall have the power to
adopt such rules and regulations for the conduct of the meetings and
management of the affairs of the Corporation as they may deem proper and the
power to adjourn any meeting of stockholders without a vote of the
stockholders, which powers may be delegated by the Board of Directors to the
Chairperson of such meeting in either such rules and regulations or pursuant
to the Bylaws of the Corporation.

 



 

7.5 _Special Meetings of Stockholders._ Subject to the terms of any one or
more series or classes of Preferred Stock, special meetings of the
stockholders of the Corporation, for any purpose or purposes, may be called at
any time, but only by or at the direction of a majority of the directors then
in office, the Chairperson of the Board or the Chief Executive Officer of the
Corporation, except as otherwise provided in the Corporations Bylaws.

 



 

 ** _ARTICLE VIII_**

 



 

8.1 _Limited Liability of Directors._ To the fullest extent permitted by
the DGCL, as the same exists or as may hereafter be amended, no director of
the Corporation shall have any personal liability to the Corporation or any of
its stockholders for monetary damages for any breach of fiduciary duty as a
director. If the DGCL is amended hereafter to permit the further elimination
or limitation of the liability of directors, then the liability of a director
of the Corporation shall be eliminated or limited to the fullest extent
permitted by the DGCL, as so amended, without further action by the
Corporation. Any alteration, amendment, addition to or repeal of this
_Section 8.1_, or adoption of any provision of this Certificate (including
any certificate of designations relating to any series or class of Preferred
Stock) inconsistent with this _Section 8.1_, shall not reduce, eliminate or
adversely affect any right or protection of a director of

 



      
 

 



 

the Corporation existing at the time of such alteration, amendment, addition
to, repeal or adoption with respect to acts or omissions occurring prior to
such alteration, amendment, addition to, repeal or adoption.

 



 

8.2 _Indemnification and Advancement._ The Corporation shall indemnify,
advance expenses to and hold harmless, to the fullest extent permitted by
applicable law as it presently exists or may hereafter be amended, any person
(Indemnitee) who was or is made or is threatened to be made a party or is
otherwise involved in any threatened, pending or completed action, suit,
arbitration, mediation, alternate dispute resolution mechanism, investigation,
inquiry, administrative hearing or any other actual, threatened or completed
proceeding, whether brought by or in the right of the Corporation or otherwise
and whether of a civil (including intentional or unintentional tort claims),
criminal, administrative or investigative (formal or informal) nature,
including appeal therefrom, in which Indemnitee was, is, will or might be
involved as a party, potential party, non-party witness or otherwise by reason
of the fact that Indemnitee is or was a director, officer, employee or agent
of the Corporation, by reason of any action (or failure to act) taken by him
or her of any action (or failure to act) on his or her part while acting as a
director, officer, employee or agent of the Corporation, or by reason of the
fact that Indemnitee is or was serving at the request of the Corporation as a
director, officer, trustee, general partner, managing member, fiduciary,
employee or agent of any other Enterprise, in each case whether or not serving
in such capacity at the time any liability or expense is incurred for which
indemnification, reimbursement, or advancement of expenses can be provided
under this Section 7.2. " _Enterprise_ " means the Corporation and any other
corporation, constituent corporation (including any constituent of a
constituent) absorbed in a consolidation or merger to which the Corporation
(or any of their wholly owned subsidiaries) is a party, limited liability
company, partnership, joint venture, trust, employee benefit plan or other
enterprise, of which Indemnitee is or was serving at the request of the
Corporation as a director, officer, trustee, general partner, managing member,
fiduciary, employee or agent.

 



 

8.3 _Nonexclusivity of Rights; Sponsors Directors._

 



 

(a) The rights conferred on any Indemnitee by this _Article VII_ shall not be
exclusive of any other rights which such Indemnitee may have or hereafter
acquire under any statute, provision of this Certificate of Incorporation, the
Bylaws, any agreement, or pursuant to any vote of stockholders or
disinterested directors or otherwise.

 



 

(b) The Corporation hereby acknowledges that the directors that are partners
or employees of the Sponsors (" _Sponsors Directors_ ") have certain rights to
indemnification, advancement of expenses and/or insurance provided by the
Sponsors and certain affiliates that, directly or indirectly, (i) are
controlled by, (ii) control or (iii) are under common control with, the
Sponsors (collectively, the " _Fund Indemnitors_ "). The Corporation hereby
agrees (i) that it is the indemnitor of first resort ( _i.e._ , its
obligations to the Sponsors Directors are primary and any obligation of the
Fund Indemnitors to advance expenses or to provide indemnification for the
same expenses or liabilities incurred by the Sponsors Directors are
secondary), (ii) that it shall be required to advance the full amount of
expenses incurred by the Sponsors Directors and shall be liable for the full
amount of all expenses, judgments, penalties, fines and amounts paid in
settlement to the extent legally permitted and as required by the terms of
this paragraph and the bylaws of the Corporation from time to time (or any
other agreement between the Corporation

 



      
 

 



 

and the Sponsors Directors), without regard to any rights the Sponsors
Directors may have against the Fund Indemnitors, and (iii) that it irrevocably
waives, relinquishes and releases the Fund Indemnitors from any and all claims
against the Fund Indemnitors for contribution, subrogation or any other
recovery of any kind in respect thereof. The Corporation further agrees that
no advancement or payment by the Fund Indemnitors on behalf of the Sponsors
Directors with respect to any claim for which the Sponsors Directors have
sought indemnification from the Corporation shall affect the foregoing and the
Fund Indemnitors shall have a right of contribution and/or to be subrogated to
the extent of such advancement or payment to all of the rights of recovery of
the Sponsors Directors against the Corporation. The Corporation and the
Sponsors Directors agree that the Fund Indemnitors are express third party
beneficiaries of the terms of this paragraph.

 



 

8.4 _Amendment or Repeal_. Any repeal or modification of the foregoing
provisions of this _Article VIII_ shall not adversely affect any right or
protection hereunder of any Indemnitee in respect of any act or omission
occurring prior to the time of such repeal or modification.

 



 

8.5 _Other Indemnification and Prepayment of Expenses_. This _Article VIII_
shall not limit the right of the Corporation, to the extent and in the manner
permitted by law, to indemnify and to advance expenses to persons other than
Indemnitees when and as authorized by appropriate corporate action.

 



 

8.6 _Change in Rights._ Neither any amendment nor repeal of this _Article
VIII_, nor the adoption of any provision of this Certificate inconsistent with
this _Article VIII_, shall eliminate or reduce the effect of this _Article
VIII_ in respect of any acts or omissions occurring prior to such alteration,
amendment, addition to, repeal or adoption.

 



 

 ** _ARTICLE IX_**

 



 

9.1 _Delaware._ Meetings of stockholders may be held within or without the
State of Delaware, as the Bylaws may provide. The books of the Corporation
may be kept (subject to any provision contained in the DGCL) outside the State
of Delaware at such place or places as may be designated from time to time by
the Board of Directors or in the Bylaws of the Corporation.

 



 

 ** _ARTICLE X_**

 



 

10.1 _Amendments to Bylaws._ In furtherance and not in limitation of the
powers conferred upon it by the laws of the State of Delaware, the Board of
Directors is expressly authorized and empowered to make, alter, amend, add to
or repeal any and all Bylaws of the Corporation by a majority of the directors
then in office. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this
Certificate (including any certificate of designations relating to any series
or class of Preferred Stock), the majority in voting power of the then-
outstanding shares of stock of the Corporation entitled to vote thereon,
voting together as a single class, shall be required for the stockholders to
make, alter, amend, add to or repeal any or all Bylaws of the Corporation or
to adopt any provision inconsistent therewith.

 



       
 

 



 

 ** _ARTICLE XI_**

 



 

11.1 _Section 203 of the DGCL._ The Corporation shall not be governed by
Section 203 of the DGCL (" _Section 203_"), and the restrictions contained in
Section 203 shall not apply to the Corporation.

 



 

11.2 _Corporate Opportunities._ To the fullest extent permitted by Section
122(17) of the DGCL and except as may be otherwise expressly agreed in writing
by the Corporation and any of the Sponsors, the Corporation, on behalf of
itself and its subsidiaries, renounces any interest or expectancy of the
Corporation and its subsidiaries in, or in being offered an opportunity to
participate in, business opportunities, which are from time to time presented
to the Sponsors or any of their managers, officers, directors, agents,
stockholders, members, partners, affiliates and subsidiaries (other than the
Corporation and its subsidiaries), even if the opportunity is one that the
Corporation or its subsidiaries might reasonably be deemed to have pursued or
had the ability or desire to pursue if granted the opportunity to do so, and
no such person or entity shall be liable to the Corporation or any of its
subsidiaries for breach of any fiduciary or other duty, as a director or
officer or otherwise, by reason of the fact that such person or entity pursues
or acquires such business opportunity, directs such business opportunity to
another person or entity or fails to present such business opportunity, or
information regarding such business opportunity, to the Corporation or its
subsidiaries unless, in the case of any such person who is a director or
officer of the Corporation, such business opportunity is expressly offered to
such director or officer in writing solely in his or her capacity as a
director or officer of the Corporation. Neither the alteration, amendment,
addition to or repeal of this Article XI, nor the adoption of any provision of
this Certificate (including any certificate of designations relating to any
series or class of Preferred Stock) inconsistent with this Article XI, shall
eliminate or reduce the effect of this Article XI in respect of any business
opportunity first identified or any other matter occurring, or any cause of
action, suit or claim that, but for this Article XI, would accrue or arise,
prior to such alteration, amendment, addition, repeal or adoption.

 



 

11.3 _Amendments to Article XI_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in
this Certificate or the Bylaws of the Corporation, for as long as the Sponsors
and their affiliates collectively beneficially own shares of stock of the
Corporation representing at least 5% of the Corporations then outstanding
shares entitled to vote generally in the election of directors, this Article
XI shall not be amended, altered or revised, including by merger or otherwise,
without the Sponsors prior written consent.

 



 

 ** _ARTICLE XII_**

 



 

12.1 _Forum._ Unless the Corporation consents in writing in advance to the
selection of an alternative forum, the Court of Chancery of the State of
Delaware shall, to the fullest extent permitted by law, be the sole and
exclusive forum for (A) any derivative action or proceeding brought on behalf
of the Corporation, (B) any action asserting a claim of breach of a fiduciary
duty owed by, or any wrongdoing by, any director, officer or employee of the
Corporation to the Corporation or the Corporations stockholders, (C) any
action asserting a claim arising pursuant to any provision of the DGCL, this
Certificate (including as it may be amended from time to time), or the Bylaws,
(D) any action to interpret, apply, enforce or determine the validity of this
Certificate or the Bylaws, or (E) any action asserting a claim governed by the
internal affairs doctrine, except for, as to each of (A) through (E) above,
any claim as to which the Court of Chancery determines that there is an
indispensable party not subject to the personal jurisdiction

 



      
 

 



 

of the Court of Chancery (and the indispensable party does not consent to the
personal jurisdiction of the Court of Chancery within ten (10) days following
such determination). To the fullest extent permitted by law, any person or
entity purchasing or otherwise acquiring or holding any interest in shares of
capital stock of the Corporation shall be deemed to have notice of and
consented to the provisions of this Article XII.

 



 

 ** _ARTICLE XIII_**

 



 

13.1 _Amendment._ The Corporation reserves the right, at any time and from
time to time, to alter, amend, add to or repeal any provision contained in
this Certificate (including any certificate of designations relating to any
series or class of Preferred Stock) in any manner now or hereafter prescribed
by the laws of the State of Delaware, and all rights, preferences, privileges
and powers of any nature conferred upon stockholders, directors or any other
persons herein are granted subject to this reservation.

 



 

 ** _ARTICLE XIV_**

 



 

14.1 _Severability._ If any provision (or any part thereof) of this
Certificate shall be held to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable as applied
to any circumstance for any reason whatsoever: (i) the validity, legality and
enforceability of such provisions in any other circumstance and of the
remaining provisions of this Certificate including, without limitation, each
portion of any section of this Certificate containing any such provision held
to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable that is not itself held to be invalid,
illegal or unenforceable) shall not in any way be affected or impaired thereby
and (ii) to the fullest extent possible, the provisions of this Certificate
(including, without limitation, each such containing any such provision held
to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable) shall be construed so as to permit
the Corporation to protect its directors, officers, employees and agents from
personal liability in respect of their good faith service or for the benefit
of the Corporation to the fullest extent permitted by law.

 ** _STOCKHOLDERS_**

 



 

Section 1.01. _Annual Meetings_. The annual meeting of the stockholders of
Avista Healthcare Public Acquisition Corp. (the " _Corporation_ ") for the
election of directors and for the transaction of such other business as
properly may come before such meeting shall be held at such place, either
within or without the State of Delaware, or, within the sole discretion of the
Board of Directors of the Corporation (the " _Board of Directors_ " or "
_Board_ "), and subject to such guidelines and procedures as the Board of
Directors may adopt, by means of remote communication as authorized by the
General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware (the " _DGCL_ "), and at such
date and at such time as may be fixed from time to time by resolution of the
Board of Directors and set forth in the notice or waiver of notice of the
meeting.

 



 

Section 1.02. _Special Meetings_. Subject to the terms of any one or more
series or classes of Preferred Stock, special meetings of the stockholders of
the Corporation, for any purpose or purposes, may be called at any time, but
only by or at the direction of a majority of the directors then in office, the
Chairperson of the Board of Directors or the Chief Executive Officer of the
Corporation. The ability of stockholders to call a special meeting of
stockholders is specifically denied. Any such special meetings of the
stockholders shall be held at such places, within or without the State of
Delaware, or, within the sole discretion of the Board of Directors, and
subject to such guidelines and procedures as the Board of Directors may adopt,
by means of remote communication as authorized by the DGCL, as shall be
specified in the respective notices or waivers of notice thereof.

 



 

Section 1.03. _No Stockholder Action by Consent_. Any action required or
permitted to be taken by the stockholders of the Corporation must be effected
by a duly called annual or special meeting of such holders and may not be
effected by written consent of the stockholders.

 



 

Section 1.04. _Notice of Meetings; Waiver_.

 



 

(a) Unless otherwise prescribed by statute or the Certificate of Incorporation
of the Corporation (as it may be amended from time to time, the " _Certificate
of Incorporation_ "), the Secretary of the Corporation or any Assistant
Secretary shall cause written notice of the place, if any, date and hour of
each meeting of

      
 

 



 

the stockholders, and, in the case of a special meeting, the purpose or
purposes for which such meeting is called, and the means of remote
communication, if any, by which stockholders and proxyholders may be deemed to
be present in person and vote at such meeting, to be given personally by mail
or by electronic transmission, or as otherwise provided in these Bylaws, not
fewer than ten (10) nor more than sixty (60) days prior to the meeting, or in
the case of a meeting called for the purpose of acting upon a merger or
consolidation not fewer than twenty (20) nor more than sixty (60) days prior
to the meeting, to each stockholder of record entitled to vote at such
meeting. If such notice is mailed, it shall be deemed to have been given
personally to a stockholder when deposited in the United States mail, postage
prepaid, directed to the stockholder at his or her address as it appears on
the record of stockholders of the Corporation, or, if a stockholder shall have
filed with the Secretary of the Corporation a written request that notices to
such stockholder be mailed to some other address, then directed to such
stockholder at such other address. If such notice is delivered (rather than
mailed) to the stockholders address, the notice shall be deemed to be given
when delivered. Such further notice shall be given as may be required by law.

 



 

(b) A written waiver of any notice of any annual or special meeting signed by
the person entitled thereto, or a waiver by electronic transmission by the
person entitled to notice, shall be deemed equivalent to notice. Neither the
business to be transacted at, nor the purpose of, any annual or special
meeting of the stockholders need be specified in a written waiver of notice.
Attendance of a stockholder at a meeting of stockholders shall constitute a
waiver of notice of such meeting, except when the stockholder attends a
meeting for the express purpose of objecting, at the beginning of the meeting,
to the transaction of any business on the ground that the meeting is not
lawfully called or convened.

 



 

(c) For notice given by electronic transmission to a stockholder to be
effective, such stockholder must consent to the Corporations giving notice by
that particular form of electronic transmission. A stockholder may revoke
consent to receive notice by electronic transmission by written notice to the
Corporation. A stockholders consent to notice by electronic transmission is
automatically revoked if the Corporation is unable to deliver two consecutive
electronic transmission notices and such inability becomes known to the
Secretary of the Corporation, any Assistant Secretary, the transfer agent or
other person responsible for giving notice.

 



 

(d) Notices are deemed given (i) if by facsimile, when faxed to a number where
the stockholder has consented to receive notice; (ii) if by electronic mail,
when mailed electronically to an electronic mail address at which the
stockholder has consented to receive such notice; (iii) if by posting on an
electronic network (such as a website or chatroom) together with a separate
notice to the stockholder of such specific posting, upon the later to occur of
(A) such posting or (B) the giving of the separate notice of such posting; or
(iv) if by any other form of electronic communication, when directed to the
stockholder in the manner consented to by the stockholder.

 



      
 

 



 

(e) If a stockholder meeting is to be held by means of remote communication
and stockholders will take action at such meeting, the notice of such meeting
must: (i) specify the means of remote communication, if any, by which
stockholders and proxyholders may be deemed to be present and vote at such
meeting; and (ii) provide the information required to access the stockholder
list. A waiver of notice may be given by electronic transmission.

 



 

Section 1.05. _Quorum_. Except as otherwise required by law or by the
Certificate of Incorporation, at each meeting of stockholders the presence in
person or by proxy of the holders of record of a majority in voting power of
the shares entitled to vote at a meeting of stockholders shall constitute a
quorum for the transaction of business at such meeting; it being understood
that to the extent the Board of Directors issues or grants any shares that are
subject to vesting or forfeiture and restrict or eliminate voting rights with
respect to such shares until such vesting criteria is satisfied or such
forfeiture provisions lapse, any such unvested shares shall not be considered
to have the power to vote at a meeting of stockholders. Where a separate vote
by one or more classes or series is required, the presence in person or by
proxy of the holders of record of a majority in voting power of the shares
entitled to vote shall constitute a quorum entitled to take action with
respect to that vote on that matter. Shares of its own stock belonging to the
Corporation or to another corporation, if a majority of the shares entitled to
vote in the election of directors of such other corporation is held, directly
or indirectly, by the Corporation, shall neither be entitled to vote nor be
counted for quorum purposes; _provided_ , however, that the foregoing shall
not limit the right of the Corporation or any subsidiary of the Corporation to
vote stock, including, but not limited to, its own stock, held by it in a
fiduciary capacity.

 



 

Section 1.06. _Voting_.

 



 

(a) If, pursuant to Section 5.05 of these Bylaws, a record date has been
fixed, every holder of record of shares entitled to vote at a meeting of
stockholders shall, subject to the terms of any one or more series or classes
of Preferred Stock, be entitled to one (1) vote for each share outstanding in
his or her name on the books of the Corporation at the close of business on
such record date. If no record date has been fixed, then every holder of
record of shares entitled to vote at a meeting of stockholders shall, subject
to the terms of any one or more series or classes of Preferred Stock, be
entitled to one (1) vote for each share of stock standing in his or her name
on the books of the Corporation at the close of business on the day next
preceding the day on which notice of the meeting is given, or, if notice is
waived, at the close of business on the day next preceding the day on which
the meeting is held.

 



 

(b) Except as otherwise required by law, the Certificate of Incorporation or
these Bylaws (including Sections 2.12 and 8.02), (i) directors shall be
elected by a plurality of the votes of the shares present in person or
represented by proxy at a meeting and voting for nominees in the election of
directors and (ii) all other matters shall be decided by the affirmative vote
of a majority of the votes properly cast for or

 



      
 

 



 

against such matter, and, for the avoidance of doubt, neither abstentions nor
broker non-votes shall be counted as votes cast for or against such matter.

 



 

Section 1.07. _Voting by Ballot_. No vote of the stockholders on an election
of directors need be taken by written ballot or by electronic transmission
unless otherwise provided in the Certificate of Incorporation or required by
law. Any vote not required to be taken by ballot or by electronic transmission
may be conducted in any manner approved by the Board of Directors prior to the
meeting at which such vote is taken.

 



 

Section 1.08. _Postponement and Adjournment_. Any meeting of stockholders may
be postponed by action of the Board of Directors at any time in advance of
such meeting. If a quorum is not present at any meeting of the stockholders,
the Chairperson of such meeting shall have the power to adjourn the meeting
without a vote of the stockholders. Notice of any adjourned meeting of the
stockholders of the Corporation need not be given if the place, if any, date
and hour thereof are announced at the meeting at which the adjournment is
taken, _provided_ , however, that if the adjournment is for more than thirty
(30) days, or if after the adjournment a new record date for the adjourned
meeting is fixed pursuant to Section 5.05 of these Bylaws, a notice of the
adjourned meeting, conforming to the requirements of Section 1.04 of these
Bylaws, shall be given to each stockholder of record entitled to vote at such
meeting. At any adjourned meeting at which a quorum is present, any business
may be transacted that might have been transacted on the original date of the
meeting.

 



 

Section 1.09. _Proxies_. Any stockholder entitled to vote at any meeting of
the stockholders may authorize another person or persons to vote at any such
meeting and express such vote on behalf of him or her by proxy. A stockholder
may authorize a valid proxy by executing a written instrument signed by such
stockholder, or by causing his or her signature to be affixed to such writing
by any reasonable means including, but not limited to, by facsimile signature,
or by transmitting or authorizing the transmission of a telegram, cablegram or
other means of electronic transmission to the person designated as the holder
of the proxy, a proxy solicitation firm or a like authorized agent. Such proxy
must be filed with the Secretary of the Corporation before or at the time of
the meeting at which such proxy will be voted. No such proxy shall be voted or
acted upon after the expiration of three (3) years from the date of such
proxy, unless such proxy provides for a longer period. A proxy shall be
irrevocable if it states that it is irrevocable and if, and only as long as,
it is coupled with an interest. A proxy may be made irrevocable regardless of
whether the interest with which it is coupled is an interest in the stock
itself or an interest in the Corporation generally. A stockholder may revoke
any proxy which is not irrevocable by attending the meeting and voting in
person or by filing with the Secretary of the Corporation either an instrument
in writing revoking the proxy or another duly executed proxy bearing a later
date. Proxies by telegram, cablegram, facsimile or other electronic
transmission must either set forth or be submitted with information from which
it can be determined that the telegram, cablegram, facsimile or other
electronic transmission was authorized by the stockholder. Any copy, facsimile
telecommunication or other reliable reproduction of a writing or transmission
created pursuant to this section may be substituted or used in lieu of the
original writing or

 



      
 

 



 

transmission for any and all purposes for which the original writing or
transmission could be used, _provided_ that such copy, facsimile
telecommunication or other reproduction shall be a complete reproduction of
the entire original writing or transmission.

 



 

Section 1.10. _Organization; Procedure_. At every meeting of stockholders, the
Chairperson of such meeting shall be the Chairperson of the Board or, if no
Chairperson of the Board has been elected or in the event of his or her
absence or disability, a Chairperson chosen by the Board of Directors. The
Secretary of the Corporation, or in the event of his or her absence or
disability, an Assistant Secretary, if any, or if there be no Assistant
Secretary, in the absence of the Secretary of the Corporation, an appointee of
the Chairperson of the meeting, shall act as Secretary of the meeting. The
order of business and all other matters of procedure at every meeting of
stockholders may be determined by the Chairperson of such meeting.

 



 

Section 1.11. _Business at Annual and Special Meetings_. No business may be
transacted at an annual or special meeting of stockholders other than business
that is:

 



 

(a) specified in a notice of meeting (or any supplement thereto) given by or
at the direction of the Board of Directors or a duly authorized committee
thereof,

 



 

(b) otherwise brought before the meeting by or at the direction of the Board
of Directors or a duly authorized committee thereof or any authorized officer
of the Corporation to whom the Board of Directors or such committee shall have
delegated such authority, or

 



 

(c) otherwise brought before the meeting by a "Noticing Stockholder" who
complies with the notice procedures set forth in Section 1.12 of these Bylaws.

 



 

A " _Noticing Stockholder_ " must be either a "Record Holder" or a "Nominee
Holder." A " _Record Holder_ " is a stockholder that holds of record stock of
the Corporation entitled to vote at the meeting on the business (including any
election of a director) to be appropriately conducted at the meeting. A "
_Nominee Holder_ " is a stockholder that holds such stock through a nominee or
"street name" holder of record and can demonstrate to the Corporation such
indirect ownership of such stock and such Nominee Holders entitlement to vote
such stock on such business. Clause (c) of this Section 1.11 shall be the
exclusive means for a Noticing Stockholder to make director nominations or
submit other business before a meeting of stockholders (other than proposals
brought under Rule 14a-8 under the Exchange Act and included in the
Corporations notice of meeting, which proposals are not governed by these
Bylaws). Notwithstanding anything in these Bylaws to the contrary, no business
shall be conducted at a stockholders meeting except in accordance with the
procedures set forth in Section 1.11 and Section 1.12 of these Bylaws.

 



 

Section 1.12. _Notice of Stockholder Business and Nominations_. In order for a
Noticing Stockholder to properly bring any item of business before a meeting
of stockholders, the Noticing Stockholder must give timely notice thereof in
writing to the

 



      
 

 



 

Secretary of the Corporation in compliance with the requirements of this
Section 1.12. This Section 1.12 shall constitute an "advance notice provision"
for annual meetings for purposes of Rule 14a-4(c)(1) under the Exchange Act.

 



 

(a) To be timely, a Noticing Stockholders notice shall be delivered to the
Secretary at the principal executive offices of the Corporation:

 



 

(i) in the case of an annual meeting of stockholders, not earlier than the
close of business on the one-hundred twentieth (120th) day and not later than
the close of business on the ninetieth (90th) day prior to the first
anniversary of the preceding years annual meeting; provided, however, that in
the event the date of the annual meeting is more than thirty (30) days before
or more than sixty (60) days after such anniversary date, notice by the
stockholder to be timely must be so delivered not earlier than the close of
business on the one-hundred twentieth (120th) day prior to the date of such
annual meeting and not later than the close of business on the later of the
ninetieth (90th) day prior to the date of such annual meeting or, if the first
public announcement of the date of such annual meeting is less than one
hundred (100) days prior to the date of such annual meeting, the tenth (10th)
day following the day on which public announcement of the date of such meeting
is first made by the Corporation;

 



 

(ii) in the case of a special meeting of stockholders called for the purpose
of electing directors, not earlier than the close of business on the one-
hundred twentieth (120th) day prior to such special meeting and not later than
the close of business on the later of the ninetieth (90th) day prior to such
special meeting or the tenth (10th) day following the date on which notice of
the date of the special meeting was mailed or public disclosure of the date of

(iii) in no event shall any adjournment or postponement of an annual or
special meeting, or the announcement thereof, commence a new time period for
the giving of a stockholders notice as described above; and

 



 

(iv) notwithstanding anything in Sections 1.12(a)(i) and (ii) to the contrary,
in the event that the number of directors to be elected to the Board of
Directors is increased and there has been no public announcement naming all of
the nominees for director or indicating the increase in the size of the Board
of Directors made by the Corporation at least ten (10) days before the last
day a Noticing Stockholder may deliver a notice of nomination in accordance
with Sections 1.12(a)(i) and (ii), a Noticing Stockholders notice required by
this bylaw shall also be considered timely, but only with respect to nominees
for any new positions created by such increase, if it shall be received by the
Secretary at the principal executive offices of the Corporation not later than
the close of business on the tenth (10th) day following the day on which such
public announcement is first made by the Corporation.

Stockholder Associated Person of the Noticing Stockholder shall in all events
be deemed to beneficially own any shares of any class or series of the
Corporation as to which such Holder or Stockholder Associated Person of the
Noticing Stockholder has a right to acquire beneficial ownership at any time
in the future) and the date such ownership was acquired;

 



 

(C) any option, warrant, convertible security, stock appreciation right, or
similar right with an exercise or conversion privilege or a settlement payment
or mechanism at a price related to any class or series of shares of the
Corporation or with a value derived in whole or in part from the price, value
or volatility of any class or series of shares of the Corporation, whether or
not the instrument or right shall be subject to settlement in the underlying
class or series of capital stock of the Corporation or otherwise (a "
_Derivative Instrument_ ") that is directly or indirectly owned beneficially
by the Holder or any Stockholder Associated Person of the Noticing Stockholder
and any other direct or indirect opportunity to profit or share in any profit
derived from any increase or decrease in the price, value or volatility of

Section 14 of the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations thereunder; and

 



 

(M) any other information as reasonably requested by the Corporation.

 



 

Such information shall be provided as of the date of the notice and shall be
supplemented by the Holder not later than ten (10) days after the record date
for the meeting to disclose such ownership as of the record date.

 



 

(ii) If the notice relates to any business other than a nomination of a
director or directors that the stockholder proposes to bring before the
meeting, the notice must set forth:

 



 

(A) a reasonably detailed description of the business desired to be brought

the nominees name, age, business and residence address and principal
occupation or employment and the class or series and number of shares of
capital stock of the Corporation that are owned beneficially or of record by
the nominee) that would be required to be disclosed in a proxy statement or
other filings required to be made in connection with solicitations of proxies
for election of directors in a contested election pursuant to Section 14 of
the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations thereunder (including such
persons written consent to being named in the proxy statement as a nominee
and to serving as a director if elected);

 



       
 

 



 

(C) a description of any agreements, arrangements and understandings between

affiliates and associates, or others acting in concert therewith, on the other
hand, including, without limitation all information that would be required to
be disclosed pursuant to Item 404 of Regulation S-K if the Holder making the
nomination or on whose behalf the nomination is made, if any, or any affiliate

"registrant" for purposes of Item 404 and the nominee were a director or
executive officer of such registrant.

 



 

(iv) with respect to each nominee for election or reelection to the Board of
Directors, the Noticing Stockholder shall include a completed and signed
questionnaire, representation, and agreement required by Section 1.13 of these
Bylaws. The Corporation may require any proposed nominee to furnish such other
information as may reasonably be required by the Corporation to determine the
eligibility of the proposed nominee to serve as an independent director of the
Corporation or that could be material to a reasonable stockholders
understanding of the independence, or lack thereof, of the nominee.

 



 

(c) For purposes of these Bylaws:

 



 

(i) " _public announcement_ " shall mean disclosure in a press release
reported by a national news service or in a document publicly filed by the
Corporation with the Securities and Exchange Commission pursuant to Section
13, 14, or 15(d) of the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations thereunder;

 



 

(ii) " _Stockholder Associated Person_ " means, with respect to any

beneficial owner of shares of stock of the Corporation owned of record or
beneficially by such stockholder (other than a stockholder that is a
depositary) and (C) any person controlling, controlled by or under common
control with any stockholder, or any Stockholder Associated Person identified
in clauses (A) or (B) above; and

 



 

(iii) " _Affiliate_ " and " _Associate_ " are defined by reference to Rule
12b-2 under the Exchange Act. An "affiliate" is any "person that directly, or
indirectly through one or more intermediaries, controls, or is controlled by,
or

 



      
 

 



 

is under common control with, the person specified." " _Control_ " is defined
as the "possession, direct or indirect, of the power to direct or cause the
direction of the management policies of a person, whether through the
ownership of voting securities, by contract, or otherwise." The term "
_associate_ " of a person means: (i) any corporation or organization (other
than the registrant or a majority-owned subsidiary of the registrant) of which
such person is an officer or partner or is, directly or indirectly, the
beneficial owner of ten (10) percent or more of any class of equity
securities, (ii) any trust or other estate in which such person has a
substantial beneficial interest or as to which such person serves as trustee
or in a similar fiduciary capacity, and (iii) any relative or spouse of such
person, or any relative of such spouse, who has the same home as such person
or who is a director or officer of the registrant or any of its parents or
subsidiaries.

 



 

(d) Only those persons who are nominated in accordance with the procedures set
forth in these Bylaws shall be eligible to serve as directors. Only such
business shall be conducted at a meeting of stockholders as shall have been
brought before the meeting in accordance with the procedures set forth in
these Bylaws, provided, however, that, once business has been properly brought
before the meeting in accordance with Section 1.12, nothing in this Section
1.12(d) shall be deemed to preclude discussion by any stockholder of such
business. If any information submitted pursuant to this Section 1.12 by any
stockholder proposing a nominee(s) for election as a director at a meeting of
stockholders is inaccurate in any material respect, such information shall be
deemed not to have been provided in accordance with Section 1.12. Except as
otherwise provided by law, the Certificate of Incorporation, or these Bylaws,
the Chairperson of the meeting shall have the power and duty to determine
whether a nomination or any business proposed to be brought before the meeting
was made or proposed, as the case may be, in compliance with the procedures
set forth in these Bylaws and, if he or she should determine that any proposed
nomination or business is not in compliance with these Bylaws, he or she shall
so declare to the meeting and any such nomination or business not properly
brought before the meeting shall be disregarded or not be transacted.

 



 

(e) Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of these Bylaws, a Noticing
Stockholder also shall comply with all applicable requirements of the Exchange
Act and the rules and regulations thereunder with respect to the matters set
forth in these Bylaws; provided, however, that any references in these Bylaws
to the Exchange Act or the rules thereunder are not intended to and shall not
limit the requirements applicable to nominations or proposals as to any other
business to be considered pursuant to Section 1.11 or Section 1.12 of these
Bylaws.

 



 

(f) Nothing in these Bylaws shall be deemed to (i) affect any rights of (A)
stockholders to request inclusion of proposals in the Corporations proxy
statement pursuant to Rule 14a-8 under the Exchange Act or (B) the holders of
any series or class of Preferred Stock, if any, if so provided under any
applicable certificate of designation for such Preferred Stock or in the
Certificate or Incorporation, or (ii) affect any rights of any holders of
common stock pursuant to a stockholders agreement with the Corporation

 



      
 

 



 

existing on the date on which these Bylaws were adopted or impose any
requirements, restrictions or limitations under Sections 1.11, 1.12 or 1.13 of
these Bylaws unless expressly imposed by any such stockholders agreement.

 



 

Section 1.13. _Submission of Questionnaire, Representation and Agreement_. To
be eligible to be a nominee for election or reelection as a director of the
Corporation by a Holder, a person must complete and deliver (in accordance
with the time periods prescribed for delivery of notice under Section 1.12 of
these Bylaws) to the Secretary at the principal executive offices of the
Corporation a written questionnaire providing the information requested about
the background and qualifications of such person and the background of any
other person or entity on whose behalf the nomination is being made and a
written representation and agreement (the questionnaire, representation, and
agreement to be in the form provided by the Secretary upon written request)
that such person:

 



 

(a) is not and will not become a party to:

 



 

(i) any agreement, arrangement or understanding with, and has not given any
commitment or assurance to, any person or entity as to how the person, if
elected as a director of the Corporation, will act or vote on any issue or
question (a " _Voting Commitment_ ") that has not been disclosed to the
Corporation, or

 



 

(ii) any Voting Commitment that could limit or interfere with the persons
ability to comply, if elected as a director of the Corporation, with the
persons fiduciary duties under applicable law,

 



 

(b) is not and will not become a party to any agreement, arrangement or
understanding with any person or entity other than the Corporation with
respect to any direct or indirect compensation, reimbursement or
indemnification in connection with service or action as a director that has
not been disclosed to the Corporation, and

 



 

(c) in the persons individual capacity and on behalf of any person or entity
on whose behalf the nomination is being made, would be in compliance, if
elected as a director of the Corporation, and will comply with all applicable
publicly disclosed corporate governance, conflict of interest, confidentiality
and stock ownership and trading policies and guidelines of the Corporation.

 



 

Section 1.14. _Inspectors of Elections_. Preceding any meeting of the
stockholders, the Board of Directors shall appoint one (1) or more persons to
act as "inspectors" of elections, and may designate one (1) or more alternate
inspectors. In the event no inspector or alternate is able to act, the
Chairperson of such meeting shall appoint one (1) or more inspectors to act at
the meeting. Each inspector, before entering upon the discharge of the duties
of an inspector, shall take and sign an oath faithfully to execute the duties
of inspector with strict impartiality and according to the best of his or her
ability. The inspector shall:

of these Bylaws, ballots and the regular books and records of the Corporation.
The inspector may consider other reliable information for the limited purpose
of reconciling proxies and ballots submitted by or on behalf of banks, brokers
or their nominees or a similar person which represent more votes than the
holder of a proxy is authorized by the record owner to cast or more votes than
the stockholder holds of record. If the inspector considers other reliable
information as outlined in this section, the inspector, at the time of his or
her certification pursuant to paragraph (f) of this section, shall specify the
precise information considered, the person or persons from whom the
information was obtained, when this information was obtained, the means by
which the information was obtained, and the basis for the inspectors belief
that such information is accurate and reliable; and

 



 

(i) do any other acts that may be proper to conduct the election or vote with
fairness to all stockholders.

 



 

Section 1.15. _Opening and Closing of Polls_. The date and time for the
opening and the closing of the polls for each matter to be voted upon at a
stockholder meeting shall be fixed by the Chairperson of the meeting and
announced at the meeting. The inspector shall be prohibited from accepting any
ballots, proxies or votes or any revocations thereof or changes thereto after
the closing of the polls, unless the Delaware Court of Chancery upon
application by a stockholder shall determine otherwise.

 



 

Section 1.16. _List of Stockholders Entitled to Vote_. The officer of the
Corporation who has charge of the stock ledger of the Corporation shall
prepare and

Section 5.01. _Certificates of Stock_. The Board of Directors may authorize
that some or all of the shares of any or all of the Corporations classes or
series of stock be evidenced by a certificate or certificates of stock. The
Board of Directors may also authorize the issue of some or all of the shares
of any or all of the Corporations classes or series of stock without
certificates. The rights and obligations of stockholders with the same class
and/or series of stock shall be identical whether or not their shares are
represented by certificates.

 



 

(a) _Shares with Certificates_. If the Board of Directors chooses to issue
shares of stock evidenced by a certificate or certificates, each individual
certificate shall include the following on its face: (i) the Corporations
name, (ii) the fact that the Corporation is organized under the laws of
Delaware, (iii) the name of the person to whom the certificate is issued, (iv)
the number of shares represented thereby, (v) the class of shares and the
designation of the series, if any, which the certificate represents, and (vi)
such other information as applicable law may require or as may be lawful. If
the Corporation is authorized to issue different classes of shares or
different series within a class, the designations, relative rights,
preferences and limitations determined for each series (and the authority of
the Board of Directors to determine variations for future series) shall be
summarized on the front or back of each certificate. Alternatively, each
certificate shall state on its front or back that the Corporation will furnish
the stockholder this information in writing, without charge, upon request.
Each certificate of stock issued by the Corporation shall be signed (either
manually or in facsimile) by any two officers of the Corporation. If the
person who signed a certificate no longer holds office when the certificate is
issued, the certificate is nonetheless valid.

 



      
 

 



 

(b) _Shares without Certificates_. If the Board of Directors chooses to issue
shares of stock without certificates, the Corporation, if required by the
Exchange Act, shall, within a reasonable time after the issue or transfer of
shares without certificates, send the stockholder a written notice containing
the information required to be set forth or stated on certificates pursuant to
the laws of the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware. The
Corporation may adopt a system of issuance, recordation and transfer of its
shares of stock by electronic or other means not involving the issuance of
certificates, provided the use of such system by the Corporation is permitted
in accordance with applicable law.

 



 

Section 5.02. _Signatures; Facsimile_. All signatures on the certificate
referred to in Section 5.01 of these Bylaws may be in facsimile, engraved or
printed form, to the extent permitted by law. In case any officer, transfer
agent or registrar who has signed, or whose facsimile, engraved or printed
signature has been placed upon a certificate, shall have ceased to be such
officer, transfer agent or registrar before such certificate is issued, it may
be issued by the Corporation with the same effect as if he or she were such
officer, transfer agent or registrar at the date of issue.

 



 

Section 5.03. _Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates_. Except as provided in
this Section 5.03, no new share certificates for shares shall be issued to
replace a previously issued certificate unless the latter is surrendered to
the Corporation and cancelled at the same time. The Board of Directors may
direct that a new certificate be issued in place of any certificate
theretofore issued by the Corporation alleged to have been lost, stolen or
destroyed, upon delivery to the Corporation of an affidavit of the owner or
owners of such certificate, setting forth such allegation. The Corporation may
require the owner of such lost, stolen or destroyed certificate, or his or her
legal representative, to give the Corporation a bond sufficient to indemnify
it against any claim that may be made against it on account of the alleged
loss, theft or destruction of any such certificate or the issuance of any such
new certificate.

 



 

Section 5.04. _Transfer of Stock_. Upon surrender to the Corporation or the
transfer agent of the Corporation of a certificate for shares, duly endorsed
or accompanied by appropriate evidence of succession, assignment or authority
to transfer, the Corporation shall issue a new certificate to the person
entitled thereto, cancel the old certificate and record the transaction upon
its books. Within a reasonable time after the transfer of uncertificated
stock, the Corporation shall send to the registered owner thereof a written
notice containing the information required to be set forth or stated on
certificates pursuant to the laws of the General Corporation Law of the State
of Delaware. Subject to the provisions of the Certificate of Incorporation and
these Bylaws, the Board of Directors may prescribe such additional rules and
regulations as it may deem appropriate relating to the issue, transfer and
registration of shares of the Corporation. No transfer of stock shall be valid
against the Corporation for any purpose until it shall have been entered in
the stock records of the Corporation by an entry showing the names of the
persons from and to whom it was transferred.

 



      
 

 



 

Section 5.05. _Record Date_. In order to determine the stockholders entitled
to notice of or to vote at any meeting of stockholders or any adjournment
thereof, the Board of Directors may fix, in advance, a record date, which
record date shall not precede the date on which the resolution fixing the
record date is adopted by the Board of Directors, and which shall not be more
than sixty (60) nor fewer than ten (10) days before the date of such meeting
(or less than twenty (20) days if a merger or consolidation is to be acted
upon at such a meeting). If no record date is fixed by the Board of Directors,
the record date for determining stockholders entitled to notice of or to vote
at a meeting of stockholders shall be at the close of business on the day next
preceding the day on which notice is given or, if notice is waived, at the
close of business on the day next preceding the day on which the meeting is
held. A determination of stockholders of record entitled to notice of or to
vote at a meeting of stockholders shall apply to any adjournment of the
meeting, _provided_ , however, that the Board of Directors may fix a new
record date for the adjourned meeting. In order that the Corporation may
determine the stockholders entitled to receive payment of any dividend or
other distribution or allotment of any rights of the stockholders entitled to
exercise any rights in respect of any change, conversion or exchange of stock,
or for the purpose of any other lawful action, the Board of Directors may fix
a record date, which record date shall not precede the date upon which the
resolution fixing the record date is adopted, and which record date shall be
not more than sixty (60) days prior to such action. If no record date is
fixed, the record date for determining stockholders for any such purpose shall
be at the close of business on the day on which the Board of Directors adopts
the resolution relating thereto.

 



 

Section 5.06. _Registered Stockholders_. Prior to due surrender of a

 **ARTICLE VI**

 



 

 ** _INDEMNIFICATION_**

 



 

Section 6.01. _Mandatory Indemnification and Advancement of Expenses_. The
Corporation shall indemnify and provide advancement to any Indemnitee to the
fullest

 



      
 

 



 

extent permitted by law, as such may be amended from time to time. The rights
to indemnification and advancement conferred in this Section shall be contract
rights. In furtherance of the foregoing indemnification and advancement
obligations, and without limiting the generality thereof:

 



 

(a) _Proceedings Other Than Proceedings by or in the Right of the
Corporation_. Any Indemnitee shall be entitled to the rights of
indemnification and advancement provided in this Section 6.01(a) if, by reason
of his or her Corporate Status (as defined below), Indemnitee is, or is
threatened to be made, a party to or participant in any Proceeding other than
a Proceeding by or in the right of the Corporation. Pursuant to this Section
6.01(a), any Indemnitee shall be indemnified against all Expenses, judgments,
penalties, fines and amounts paid in settlement actually and reasonably
incurred by him or her, or on his or her behalf, in connection with such
Proceeding or any claim, issue or matter therein, if Indemnitee acted in good
faith and in a manner Indemnitee reasonably believed to be in or not opposed
to the best interests of the Corporation, and with respect to any criminal
Proceeding, had no reasonable cause to believe Indemnitees conduct was
unlawful. The termination of any Proceeding by judgment, order, settlement,
conviction, or upon a plea of _nolo contendere_ or its equivalent, shall not,
of itself, create a presumption that Indemnitee did not act in good faith and
in a manner which Indemnitee reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to
the best interests of the Corporation, and, with respect to any criminal
action or proceeding, had reasonable cause to believe that Indemnitees
conduct was unlawful.

 



 

(b) _Proceedings by or in the Right of the Corporation_. Any Indemnitee shall
be entitled to the rights of indemnification and advancement provided in this
Section 6.01(b) if, by reason of his or her Corporate Status, Indemnitee is,
or is threatened to be made, a party to or participant in any Proceeding
brought by or in the right of the Corporation. Pursuant to this Section
6.01(b), any Indemnitee shall be indemnified against all Expenses actually and
reasonably incurred by Indemnitee, or on Indemnitees behalf, in connection
with such Proceeding if Indemnitee acted in good faith and in a manner
Indemnitee reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests
of the Corporation; _provided_ , _however_ , if applicable law so provides, no
indemnification against such Expenses shall be made in respect of any claim,
issue or matter in such Proceeding as to which Indemnitee shall have been
finally adjudged to be liable to the Corporation unless and to the extent that
the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware or the court in which such
Proceeding was brought shall determine that such indemnification may be made.

 



 

(c) The Corporation hereby acknowledges that Indemnitees may have certain
rights to indemnification, advancement of expenses and/or insurance provided
by sources other than the Corporation (" _Third Party Indemnitors_ "). The
Corporation hereby agrees (i) that it is the indemnitor of first resort (i.e.,
its obligations to the Indemnitees are primary and any obligation of the Third
Party Indemnitors to advance expenses or to provide indemnification for the
same expenses or liabilities incurred by the Indemnitees are secondary), (ii)
that it shall be required to advance the full amount of Expenses incurred by
the Indemnitees and shall be liable for the full amount of all Expenses,

 



      
 

 



 

judgments, penalties, fines and amounts paid in settlement to the extent
legally permitted and as required by the terms of this paragraph and the
Bylaws of the Corporation from time to time (or any other agreement between
the Corporation and the Indemnitees), without regard to any rights the
Indemnitees may have against the Third Party Indemnitors, and (iii) that it
irrevocably waives, relinquishes and releases the Third Party Indemnitors from
any and all claims against the Third Party Indemnitors for contribution,
subrogation or any other recovery of any kind in respect thereof. The
Corporation further agrees that no advancement or payment by the Third Party
Indemnitors on behalf of the Indemnitees with respect to any claim for which
the Indemnitees have sought indemnification from the Corporation shall affect
the foregoing and the Third Party Indemnitors shall have a right of
contribution and/or to be subrogated to the extent of such advancement or
payment to all of the rights of recovery of the Indemnitees against the
Corporation. The Corporation and the Indemnitees agree that the Third Party
Indemnitors are express third party beneficiaries of the terms of this
paragraph.

 



 

Section 6.02. _Indemnification for Expenses of a Party Who is Wholly or Partly
Successful_. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Article VI, to the
extent that any Indemnitee is, by reason of his or her Corporate Status, a
party to and is successful, on the merits or otherwise, in any Proceeding, he
or she shall be indemnified to the maximum extent permitted by law, as such
may be amended from time to time, against all Expenses actually and reasonably
incurred by him or her or on his or her behalf in connection therewith. If
such Indemnitee is not wholly successful in such Proceeding but is successful,
on the merits or otherwise, as to one or more but less than all claims, issues
or matters in such Proceeding, the Corporation shall indemnify Indemnitee
against all Expenses actually and reasonably incurred by him or her or on his
or her behalf in connection with each successfully resolved claim, issue or
matter. For purposes of this Section 6.02 and without limitation, the
termination of any claim, issue or matter in such a Proceeding by dismissal,
with or without prejudice, shall be deemed to be a successful result as to
such claim, issue or matter.

 



 

Section 6.03. _Employees and Agents_. This Section VI shall not limit the
right of the Corporation, to the extent and in the manner permitted by law, to
indemnify and to advance expenses to persons other than Indemnitees when and
as authorized by appropriate corporate action. Without limiting the generality
of the foregoing, the Corporation may, to the extent authorized from time to
time by the Board of Directors, provide rights to indemnification and
advancement of expenses to employees and agents of the Corporation.

 



 

Section 6.04. _Advancement of Expenses_. Notwithstanding any other provision
of this Article VI, the Corporation shall advance all Expenses incurred by or
on behalf of any Indemnitee in connection with any Proceeding by reason of
Indemnitees Corporate Status within thirty (30) days after the receipt by the
Corporation of a statement or statements from Indemnitee requesting such
advance or advances from time to time, whether prior to or after final
disposition of such Proceeding, and regardless of such Indemnitees ability to
repay any such amounts in the event of an ultimate determination that
Indemnitee is not entitled thereto. Such statement or statements shall
reasonably

 



      
 

 



 

evidence the Expenses incurred by Indemnitee and shall include or be preceded
or accompanied by a written undertaking by or on behalf of Indemnitee to repay
any Expenses advanced if it shall ultimately be determined that Indemnitee is
not entitled to be indemnified against such Expenses. Any advances and
undertakings to repay pursuant to this Section 6.04 shall be unsecured and
interest free.

 



 

Section 6.05. _Non-Exclusivity_. The rights to indemnification and to the
payment of Expenses incurred in defending a Proceeding in advance of the final
disposition of such Proceeding conferred in this Article VI shall not be
exclusive of any other rights which any person may have or hereafter acquire
under applicable law, the Certificate of Incorporation, these Bylaws, any
agreement, vote of stockholders, resolution of directors or otherwise. The
assertion or employment of any right or remedy in this Article VI, or
otherwise, shall not prevent the concurrent assertion or employment of any
other right or remedy.

 



 

Section 6.06. _Insurance_. The Corporation shall have the power to purchase
and maintain insurance, at its expense, to the fullest extent permitted by
law, as such may be amended from time to time. Without limiting the generality
of the foregoing, the Corporation shall have the power to purchase and
maintain insurance on behalf of any person who is or was or has agreed to
become a director, officer, employee or agent of the Corporation, or who is
serving, was serving, or has agreed to serve at the request of the Corporation
as a director, officer, trustee, general partner, managing member, fiduciary,
employee or agent of any other Enterprise, against any liability asserted
against him or her and incurred by him or her or on his or her behalf in such
capacity, or arising out of his or her status as such, whether or not the
Corporation would have the power to indemnify him or her against such
liability.

 



 

Section 6.07. _Exception to Rights of Indemnification and Advancement_.
Notwithstanding any provision in this Article VI, the Corporation shall not be
obligated by this Article VI to make any indemnity or advancement in
connection with any claim made against an Indemnitee:

 



 

(a) subject to Section 6.01(c), for which payment has actually been made to or
on behalf of such Indemnitee under any insurance policy or other indemnity
provision, except with respect to any excess beyond the amount paid under any
insurance policy or other indemnity provision;

 



 

(b) for an accounting of profits made from the purchase and sale (or sale and
purchase) by such Indemnitee of securities of the Corporation within the
meaning of Section 16(b) of the Exchange Act or similar provisions of state
statutory law or common law;

 



 

(c) for reimbursement to the Corporation of any bonus or other incentive-based
or equity based compensation or of any profits realized by Indemnitee from the
sale of securities of the Corporation in each case as required under the
Exchange Act; or

 



      
 

 



 

(d) in connection with any Proceeding (or any part of any Proceeding)
initiated by such Indemnitee, including any Proceeding (or any part of any
Proceeding) initiated by such Indemnitee against the Corporation or its
directors, officers, employees or other Indemnitees, unless (i) the
Corporation has joined in or, prior to such Proceedings initiation, the Board
of Directors authorized such Proceeding (or any part of such Proceeding), (ii)
the Corporation provides the indemnification or advancement, in its sole
discretion, pursuant to the powers vested in the Corporation under applicable
law, or (iii) the Proceeding is one to enforce such Indemnitees rights under
this Article VI, Article VII of the Certificate of Incorporation or any other
indemnification, advancement or exculpation rights to which Indemnitee may at
any time be entitled under applicable law or any agreement.

 



 

Section 6.08. _Definitions_. For purposes of this Article VI:

 



 

(a) " _Corporate Status_ " describes the status of an individual who is or was
or has agreed to become a director or officer of the Corporation or who is
serving, was serving, or has agreed to serve at the request of the Corporation
as a director, officer, trustee, general partner, managing member, fiduciary,
employee or agent of any other Enterprise.

 



 

(b) " _Enterprise_ " shall mean the Corporation and any other corporation,
constituent corporation (including any constituent of a constituent) absorbed
in a consolidation or merger to which the Corporation (or any of their wholly
owned subsidiaries) is a party, limited liability company, partnership, joint
venture, trust, employee benefit plan or other enterprise, of which Indemnitee
is or was serving at the request of the Corporation as a director, officer,
trustee, general partner, managing member, fiduciary, employee or agent.

 



 

(c) " _Expenses_ " shall include all direct and indirect costs, fees and
expenses of any type or nature whatsoever, including, without limitation, all
attorneys fees and costs, retainers, court costs, transcript costs, fees of
experts, witness fees, travel expenses, fees of private investigators and
professional advisors, duplicating costs, printing and binding costs,
telephone charges, postage, delivery service fees, fax transmission charges,
secretarial services, any federal, state, local or foreign taxes imposed on
Indemnitee as a result of the actual or deemed receipt of any payments under
this Article VI, ERISA excise taxes and penalties, and all other
disbursements, obligations or expenses in connection with prosecuting,
defending, preparing to prosecute or defend, investigating, being or preparing
to be a witness in, settlement or appeal of, or otherwise participating in, a
Proceeding, including, without limitation, reasonable compensation for time
spent by the Indemnitee for which he or she is not otherwise compensated by
the Corporation or any third party. Expenses also shall include Expenses
incurred in connection with any appeal resulting from any Proceeding,
including without limitation the principal, premium, security for, and other
costs relating to any cost bond, supersedeas bond, or other appeal bond or its
equivalent.

 



      
 

 



 

(d) " _Indemnitee_ " means any current or former director or officer of the
Corporation; and

 



 

(e) " _Proceeding_ " shall include any threatened, pending or completed
action, suit, arbitration, mediation, alternate dispute resolution mechanism,
investigation, inquiry, administrative hearing or any other actual, threatened
or completed proceeding, whether brought by or in the right of the Corporation
or otherwise and whether of a civil (including intentional or unintentional
tort claims), criminal, administrative or investigative (formal or informal)
nature, including appeal therefrom, in which Indemnitee was, is, will or might
be involved as a party, potential party, non-party witness or otherwise by
reason of the fact that Indemnitee is or was a director, officer, employee or
agent of the Corporation, by reason of any action (or failure to act) taken by
him or of any action (or failure to act) on his part while acting as a
director, officer, employee or agent of the Corporation, or by reason of the
fact that Indemnitee is or was serving at the request of the Corporation as a
director, officer, trustee, general partner, managing member, fiduciary,
employee or agent of any other Enterprise, in each case whether or not serving
in such capacity at the time any liability or expense is incurred for which
indemnification, reimbursement, or advancement of expenses can be provided
under this Article VI. If the Indemnitee believes in good faith that a given
situation may lead to or culminate in the institution of a Proceeding, this
shall be considered a Proceeding under this Article VI.

 



 

Section 6.09. _Right of Indemnitee to Bring Suit_. If a claim under this
Article VI is not paid in full by the Corporation within thirty (30) days
after a written claim has been received by the Corporation, Indemnitee may at
any time thereafter bring suit against the Corporation in the Court of
Chancery of the State of Delaware or any other court of competent jurisdiction
in the State of Delaware to recover the unpaid amount of the claim. In any
such action, the Corporation shall have the burden of proving that Indemnitee
was not entitled to the requested indemnification, advancement or payment of
Expenses. It shall be a defense to any such action (other than an action
brought to enforce a claim for Expenses incurred in defending any proceeding
in advance of its final disposition where the required undertaking, if any is
required, has been tendered to the Corporation) that Indemnitee has not met
the standards of conduct which make it permissible under these Bylaws, the
Certificate of Incorporation or the DGCL for the Corporation to indemnify
Indemnitee for the amount claimed. Neither the failure of the Corporation
(including its Board of Directors, independent legal counsel, or its
stockholders) to have made a determination prior to the commencement of such
action that indemnification or advancement is proper in the circumstances
because Indemnitee has met the applicable standard of conduct set forth in
these Bylaws, the Certificate of Incorporation or the DGCL, nor an actual
determination by the Corporation (including its Board of Directors,
independent legal counsel, or its stockholders) that Indemnitee has not met
such applicable standard of conduct, shall be a defense to the action or
create a presumption that Indemnitee has not met any applicable standard of
conduct. If successful, in whole or in part, Indemnitee shall also be entitled
to be paid the Expenses of prosecuting such action.

 



       
 

 



 

Section 6.10. _Survival of Indemnification and Advancement of Expenses_. The
indemnification and advancement of expenses provided by, or granted pursuant
to, this Article VI shall continue as to a person who has ceased to be a
director or officer and shall inure to the benefit of the heirs, executors and
administrators of such a person.

 



 

Section 6.11. _Change in Rights_. Neither any amendment nor repeal of this
Article VI, nor the adoption of any provision in these Bylaws inconsistent
with this Article VI, shall eliminate or reduce the effect of this Article VI
in respect of any acts or omissions occurring prior to such alteration,
amendment, addition to, repeal or adoption.
