---|--- 



   12.1 | Tax Indemnity 
---|--- 

The Seller agrees that, if at any time, the Company receives or suffers a Tax
Assessment, then the Seller must pay the Buyer, an amount equal to the Tax

     | (a) | 1 Business Day before the Tax Assessment Amount is due and

---|---|--- 
 



     | (d) | in the case of clause 12.3(b) an amount to the Seller equal

the Buyer must lodge (or procure the lodgement of) any Tax Return for the

Reviewer may also provide the Preparer with a Tax Dispute Notice within 2
Business Days (or 1 Business Day if the Relevant Return relates to GST) of
the last day on which the Preparer could have provided a Confirmation Notice
under clause 12.5(d) above. 
---|---|--- 



     | (f) | If the Reviewer does not provide a Tax Dispute Notice in
relation to a Relevant Return in accordance with clause 12.5(e) above, the

if the Relevant Return relates to GST), the parties agree to refer the dispute
to a Tax Expert in accordance with clause 12.6). 
---|---|--- 
 



     | (h) | The Buyer or Seller (as applicable) must, subject to clause
12.5(i) below, amend any Relevant Return which is the subject of a Tax Dispute
Notice in accordance with the Tax Experts decision prior to lodgement.  
---|---|--- 



     | (i) | If a Relevant Return is due for lodgement either: 
---|---|--- 



     | (i) | before the review process set out in clauses 12.5(c) to

---|---|--- 



     | (ii) | before the time the Tax Expert has made a decision in
accordance with clause 12.6, the Buyer must, if practicable, seek an extension
of time for lodgement from the relevant Government Agency. If the
Government Agency does not grant an extension of time before the Relevant
Return is due for lodgement, 
---|---|--- 

the Seller will determine (and the Buyer must procure that the necessary
actions are taken) to either:



     | (iii) | lodge the Relevant Return in the form determined by the
Seller notwithstanding the Tax Expert has not made a decision; or 
---|---|--- 



     | (iv) | delay lodgement of the Relevant Return until such time that
the review process has been completed to the satisfaction of the parties or
the Tax Expert has made a decision. 
---|---|--- 
 



     | (j) | If the Relevant Return is lodged in accordance with clause
12.5(i)(iii) above and, the completion of the review process or the Tax

procure that the Relevant Return is amended accordingly. 
---|---|--- 



     | (k) |

The parties agree to provide each other with all reasonable assistance and
access to records and documents (including all electronic records and

---|---|---|---|---|---|--- 
  (C) King and Wood Mallesons |  | Share Sale Agreement |  | 29 
  30379804_3 |  |  |  | or the Seller Group. Nothing in this clause 12.5(k) requires a party to
provide access to any information, documents or records if to do so would
result in the waiver of legal professional privilege.

     | (l) | Each party must pay its own costs in connection with this
clause. 
---|---|--- 



   12.6 | Tax Expert 
---|---

is to be referred to a Tax Expert in accordance with clause 12.5(g) in
relation to the preparation of a Relevant Return then the dispute is to be
decided by the Tax Expert in accordance with this clause. 
---|---|--- 



     | (b) | The Seller and the Buyer may make submissions to the Tax
Expert in relation to the dispute.

     | (d) | The Tax Expert must provide written notice of its decision
to the Seller and the Buyer and the decision of the Tax Expert is conclusive
and binding on the parties in the absence of manifest error.

Experts costs and expenses in relation to the dispute unless otherwise
determined by the Tax Expert. 
---|---|--- 
 



   12.7 | Pre-Completion Tax matters 
---|--- 



     | (a) | Except in relation to the preparation and lodgement of a
Pre-Completion Tax Return or a Straddle Return (to which clause 12.5 applies),
the parties agree that the Buyer must keep the Seller informed of any
disclosures made to any Government Agency which relate to any event, act,
matter or transaction or amount derived (or deemed to be derived) by the
Company or expenditure incurred by the Company before Completion ("Pre-
Completion Tax Event") and that other than in respect of income Tax, the
Buyers obligation under this clause exists for the period during which the
Buyer is able to make a Claim under the Tax Indemnity in accordance with the
time limits imposed by clause 14.9(a).  
---|---|--- 



     | (b) | The Buyer agrees that it will (and will procure that from
Completion, the Company will): 
---|---|--- 



     | (i) | not disclose any information to a Government Agency to the
extent to which it relates to a Pre-Completion Tax Event without the prior
written consent of the Seller (not to be unreasonably withheld), except as
required by law; 
---|---|--- 



     | (ii) | not file, or cause to be filed, any amended Tax Return for
the Company which relates to a Tax Period (or part thereof) ending on or
before Completion without the prior written consent of the Seller (not to
be unreasonably withheld); 
---|---|--- 



     | (iii) | promptly provide the Seller with copies of any
correspondence with, or material provided to or by, a Government Agency and
keep the Seller informed of any communications with any Government Agency in
relation to any Pre-Completion Tax Event; and

a Tax Period which commenced before Completion, then to the extent to which

---|---|--- 



     | (A) | the Buyer must allow the Seller, at its own expense, to
participate in any dealings with the Government Agency with respect to the
audit or investigation but only with respect to the period up to Completion;
and  
---|---|--- 



     | (B) | the Buyer must not enter into any settlement with respect to
the audit or investigation without the Sellers written consent but only with

If, as a result of an audit or investigation to which this clause 12.7(b)(iv)
applies, the Buyer notifies the Seller of a Claim in accordance with clause
14.1 or clause 14.2 then clause 14.4 will thereafter apply with respect to the
conduct of the audit or investigation and not this clause 12.7(b).
