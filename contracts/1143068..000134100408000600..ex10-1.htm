(b) In consideration for the sale, transfer and conveyance of the Membership
Interests, upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in
this Agreement, the Purchaser shall pay to the Seller at the Closing an
aggregate amount in cash equal to $300,000,000 plus or minus the difference,
if any, between the Estimated Working Capital and the Target Working Capital
(the "Purchase Price") by wire transfer of immediately available funds at the
time of the Closing to such account or accounts as the Seller specifies at
least three business days before the Closing Date.

 

 

(c) For purposes of this Agreement,

 

 

(i) "Closing Working Capital" shall mean the Working Capital as of 11:59
p.m. (Eastern time) on the Financial Closing Date.

 

 

(ii) "Estimated Working Capital" shall mean the Seller\'s good faith estimate
of the Working Capital as of the Financial Closing Date.

 

 

(iii) "Financial Closing Date" shall mean the last business day of the month
immediately preceding the month in which the Closing occurs.

 

 

(iv) "Target Working Capital" shall mean $120,313,707.29, the details of
which are more particularly described in Section 2.01(c)(v) of the Seller\'s
Disclosure Letter.

 

 

(v) "Working Capital" shall mean, with respect to the Company as of a
specified date, the current assets of the Company minus the current
liabilities, each as calculated in accordance with the policies and
procedures set out in Section 2.01(c)(v) of the Seller\'s Disclosure Letter

 


 

 

 

 

 

 

 

5  

 

 

 

 

 


 

(but excluding the specified items set out in Section 2.01(c)(v) of the
Seller\'s Disclosure Letter). The Working Capital calculation shall be
prepared in accordance with GAAP applied on a basis consistent with
past practice and consistent with the Company\'s Financial Statements, but
excluding the specified items set out in section 2.01(c)(v) of the Seller\'s
Disclosure Letter.

 

 

Section 2.02 Post Closing Adjustment

 

 

(a) As promptly as reasonably practicable, but no later than sixty (60) days
immediately following Closing, the Purchaser shall prepare and deliver to the
Seller an unaudited balance sheet of the Company (the "Closing
Balance Sheet") as of the Financial Closing Date, together with a
certificate, executed by the Purchaser\'s chief financial officer (or
equivalent), setting forth the Purchaser\'s calculation, including the
components thereof, of the Closing Working Capital (together, the
"Calculation").

 

 

(b) The Purchaser shall provide the Seller and its accountants with such
access to the applicable personnel, books, records, information, materials,
and data of the Company, as reasonably requested by the Seller, for the
purpose of the Seller verifying the calculations provided by the Purchaser in
the Closing Balance Sheet.

 

 

(c) The Seller will notify the Purchaser in writing if it has any objections
(which must be made in good faith) to the Calculation. The Seller will be
deemed to have accepted the Calculation, and the Calculation will be deemed
to be finalized, if the Seller does not give the Purchaser notice of its
objections within forty-five (45) days from the date of receipt of
the Calculation. A notice of objection must contain a statement
setting forth in reasonable detail the basis of the Seller\'s objections and
each amount in dispute.

 

 

(d) If the Seller makes good faith objections to the Calculation within the
period set forth in Section 2.02(c) above, the Purchaser and the Seller will
work expeditiously and in good faith to resolve the matters in dispute
within a period of twenty (20) days after the date the Purchaser receives
notice of the Seller\'s objections. If the Purchaser and the Seller cannot
resolve their dispute within such period, the dispute will be submitted for
determination to the firm of accountants first set forth in Section 2.02(d)
of the Purchaser\'s Disclosure Letter, or if such firm of accountants is not
available or willing to perform, to the firm of accountants next set forth in
Section 2.02(d) of the Purchaser\'s Disclosure Letter, or if neither
such firm of accountants is available or willing to act, to an independent
firm of chartered accountants or certified public accountants of
international standing or affiliation and qualified to make the determination
(which is not at such time otherwise retained by either the Seller or the
Purchaser or any of their respective Affiliates), mutually agreed to by the
Seller and the Purchaser, each acting reasonably. The determination of the
firm of accountants of the matters in dispute will be final and binding upon
the parties and will not be subject to appeal. The firm of accountants will
be deemed to be acting as experts and not as arbitrators. The procedure to be
followed by the parties with respect to the determination will be determined
by the firm of accountants in its sole discretion. Each party will provide
the firm of accountants access to all relevant books and records and to the
appropriate personnel to assist it in the determination of the final
Calculation.

 


 

 

 

 

 

 

 

6  

 

 

 

 

 


 

(e) The Seller and the Purchaser will each bear the fees and expenses of
their respective personnel or advisors in preparing or reviewing the
Calculation and, if applicable, their respective costs in presenting their
cases to the firm of accountants. The costs and expenses of the firm of
accountants will be borne equally by the Seller and the Purchaser.

 

 

(f) Once the Closing Working Capital is finally determined, either through
agreement of the parties or pursuant to Section 2.02(d), the Purchase Price
shall be increased or decreased, on a dollar-for-dollar basis, by the
difference, if any, between the Closing Working Capital and Estimated Working
Capital, as follows:

 

 

(i)   if the Closing Working Capital is greater than the Estimated Working
Capital, within five (5) business days of the date on which it is finally
determined, the Purchaser shall pay to the Seller an amount equal to such
difference; or

 

 

(ii)   if the Closing Working Capital is less than the Estimated Working
Capital, within five (5) business days of the date on which it is finally
determined, the Seller shall pay to the Purchaser an amount equal to the
Working Capital Adjustment.

 

 

(iii) Any payment due hereunder shall be paid via wire transfer to the
account(s) designated by the receiving party.

suitable for the uses for which they are used in the operation of the
business of such Persons.

subject to applicable confidentiality protections and consistent
with Requirements of Law, the Seller shall (and shall cause the Company
and its Subsidiary to): (a) provide the Purchaser and the Purchaser\'s
representatives with reasonable access during normal business hours, upon
reasonable notice to the General Counsel of the Seller (which,
unless contrary notice is provided to the Purchaser, shall be deemed to be
the General Counsel of Parent), to the Company\'s and its

 


 

 

 

 

 

 

 

30  

 

 

 

 

 


 

Subsidiary\'s assets and to all existing books, records, Tax Returns, work
papers and other documents and information relating to the Company and
its Subsidiary, whether held by the Company, its Subsidiary, the Seller or
the Parent; and (b) provide or make available to the Purchaser and
the Purchaser\'s representatives such copies of the existing books, records,
Tax Returns, work papers and other documents and information relating to the
Company and its Subsidiary, whether held by the Company, its Subsidiary, the
Seller or the Parent, as the Purchaser may reasonably request. In addition,
during the Pre-Closing Period, subject to applicable confidentiality
protections and consistent with Requirements of Law, the Seller shall (and
shall cause the Company and its Subsidiary to) assist Purchaser in gaining a
greater understanding of its operations to facilitate a transition to
integrated management with the Purchaser\'s operations post Closing,
including by providing (w) ongoing updates with respect to the Company\'s
commodity positions from and after January 1, 2008 as a result of putting in
place incremental retail and wholesale Contracts; (x) reasonable access to
the Company\'s supply personnel, operational data and pricing models; (y)
risk reports, prepared on a daily and monthly basis, showing the Company\'s
net open position and daily profit and loss change; and (z) monthly financial
statements prepared on a basis consistent with the Company\'s
historical practices. Without limiting the generality of any of the
foregoing, during the Pre-Closing Period and subject to applicable
confidentiality protections and consistent with Requirements of Law, the
Seller and the Purchaser shall promptly provide the other party with copies
of any notice, report or other document filed with or sent to any
Governmental Body on behalf of the Seller or the Purchaser, as applicable, in
connection with the transactions contemplated herein. The foregoing shall not
require the Seller to permit any inspection, or to disclose any information,
that could reasonably be expected to result in (i) the disclosure of any
trade secrets of third parties or the violation of any obligations of the
Seller, the Company or the Company\'s Subsidiary with respect
to confidentiality if the Seller shall have used reasonable efforts to obtain
the consent of such third party to such inspection or disclosure; (ii) the
waiver of any applicable attorney-client or work product privilege so long
as the Seller has taken reasonable steps to permit inspection of or
to disclose information described in this clause (ii) on a basis that does
not compromise the Seller\'s, the Company\'s or the Company\'s Subsidiary\'s
privilege with respect thereto; or (iii) the violation of any applicable
Requirements of Law. The parties shall seek in good faith appropriate
substitute disclosure arrangements under circumstances in which the
immediately preceding sentence applies. No investigation by the Purchaser
shall limit or otherwise affect any of the representations, warranties,
covenants or obligations of the Seller contained in this Agreement.

 

 

Section 6.03 No Solicitation. None of the Seller, the Company or the
Company\'s Subsidiary will, and each will ensure that its respective
representatives do not, directly or indirectly, solicit, initiate, encourage
(including by way of furnishing information or assistance) or take any other
action to facilitate, any submission of inquiries, proposals or offers from
any Person (other than the Purchaser or its representatives) relating to, and
will not participate in (other than with the Purchaser or its
representatives) any negotiations regarding, or furnish to any Person (other
than the Purchaser or its representatives) any information with respect to,
or otherwise cooperate in any way with, or assist or participate in,
facilitate or encourage, any effort or attempt with respect to any sale,
disposition, lease or other transfer, directly or indirectly, of the Company
or its Subsidiary (except (i) for the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement and (ii) with respect to routine sales of assets in the ordinary

 


 

 

 

 

 

 

 

31  

 

 

 

 

 


 

course of business consistent with past practice) (an
"Acquisition Transaction"). If any such inquiries, proposals or offers for
an Acquisition Transaction are received by the Seller, the Seller shall
promptly inform the Purchaser in writing of all relevant details with respect
to the foregoing.

 

 

Section 6.04 Confidentiality; Disclosure.

 

 

(a) The parties hereto acknowledge that the Purchaser and the Parent have
previously entered into a confidentiality agreement, dated as of November 30,
2007, as amended (the "Confidentiality Agreement"), which shall continue in
full force and effect in accordance with its terms.

 

 

(b) After the date hereof, neither the Seller, the Parent nor the Company
shall, and, until Closing, the Seller shall not permit the Company nor its
Subsidiary to terminate, amend, modify or waive any provision of any
confidentiality or standstill agreement in respect of the Company and its
Subsidiary to which it is a party. After the date hereof, the Parent and the
Company, jointly and severally, shall enforce to the fullest extent permitted
under applicable law, the provisions of any such agreement, including without
limitation, by taking reasonable steps to enforce specifically the terms and
provisions thereof in any court having jurisdiction. Immediately following
the date of execution of this Agreement, the Parent shall request that any
Person in receipt of confidential information shall either (i)
promptly redeliver to the Parent all such confidential information
(including but not limited to written and computer files) and any other
material containing or reflecting, or generated from, any information in such
confidential information (whether prepared by such Person, its representatives
or otherwise) or (ii) destroy all such confidential information (including
but not limited to written and computer files) and any other material
containing or reflecting, or generated from, any information in such
confidential information (whether prepared by such Person, its
representatives or otherwise) and certify in writing to the Parent by
an authorized officer of such Person supervising such destruction as to
such destruction, in each case, to the extent provided for in the
confidentiality or standstill agreement.

 

 

Section 6.05 Expenses. All fees and expenses incurred in connection with this
Agreement and the transactions contemplated herein shall be paid (or caused
to be paid) by the party incurring such expenses, whether or not such
transactions are consummated.

 

 

Section 6.06 Regulatory Approvals and Related Matters.

 

 

(a) In addition to and without limitation on the other provisions of this
Section 6.06, each party shall use reasonable best efforts to prepare and
file, as promptly as practicable after the date of this Agreement, all
necessary notices, reports and other documents required to be filed by such
party with any Governmental Body with respect to the
transactions contemplated herein. Without limiting the generality of
the foregoing, the parties shall, as promptly as practicable after the date
of this Agreement:

 

 

(i) prepare and file the notifications required under the Hart-Scott-Rodino
Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, as amended (the "HSR Act"),

 


 

 

 

 

 

 

 

32  

 

 

 

 

 


 

and any other Antitrust Laws (as defined in this Section 6.06(a)). The
parties shall use reasonable best efforts to respond as promptly as
practicable to: (i) any inquiries or requests (including any "second request"
for information) received from the Federal Trade Commission or the U.S.
Department of Justice ("FTC/DOJ"), or any other Governmental Body
for additional information or documentation; and (ii) any inquiries or
requests received from any state attorney general or other Governmental Body
in connection with antitrust or related matters. For purposes of this
Agreement, "Antitrust Law" shall mean the HSR Act and any other Requirements
of Law that are designed to prohibit, restrict or regulate actions having the
purpose or effect of monopolization or restraint of trade;

 

 

(ii)   prepare and file an application for the approval by the Federal
Energy Regulatory Commission under Section 203 of the Federal Power Act (the
"FERC Approval");

 

 

(iii)   prepare and file a joint voluntary notice in respect of the
transactions contemplated hereby under Exon-Florio; and

 

 

(iv)   prepare and file applications for all other regulatory approvals
listed on Section 6.06(a) of the Seller\'s Disclosure Letter.

 

 

(b) The parties each shall promptly supply each other with any information
that may be required in order to effectuate any filings or applications
pursuant to Section 6.06(a). Except where prohibited by
applicable Requirements of Law, and subject to the Confidentiality Agreement,
each party shall consult with the other parties prior to taking a position
with respect to any such filing, shall permit the other to review and discuss
in advance, and consider in good faith the views of the other in connection
with, any analyses, appearances, presentations, memoranda, briefs, white
papers, arguments, opinions and proposals before making or submitting any of
the foregoing to any Governmental Body by or on behalf of any party hereto in
connection with any investigations or proceedings in connection with this
Agreement or the transactions contemplated herein, coordinate with the other
parties in preparing and exchanging such information and promptly provide the
other parties (and their counsel) with copies of all filings, presentations
or submissions (and a summary of any oral presentations) made by such party
with any Governmental Body in connection with this Agreement or the
transactions contemplated herein; provided that with respect to any such
filing, presentation or submission, each party need not supply the other
parties (or their counsel) with copies (or, in case of oral presentations, a
summary) to the extent that any Requirements of Law applicable to such party
requires such party or its Affiliates to restrict or prohibit access to any
such properties or information or to the extent required by any existing
confidentiality or non-disclosure agreement. None of the parties shall
independently participate in any meeting, or engage in any
substantive conversation, with any Governmental Body in respect of any such
filings, investigation or other inquiry without previously informing each
other party of the meeting and, to the extent permitted by such Governmental
Body, the opportunity to attend and/or participate.

 


 

 

 

 

 

 

 

33  

 

 

 

 

 


 

(c) Each party will inform the other parties promptly upon the receipt of:
(x) any comments from any officials of any Governmental Body in connection
with any filings made pursuant hereto, and (y) any request by any officials
of any Governmental Body for amendments or supplements to any filings made
pursuant to, or information provided to comply in all material respects with,
any applicable Requirements of Law. Whenever any event occurs that is
required to be set forth in an amendment or supplement to any filing made
pursuant to Section 6.06(a), each party will promptly inform the other
parties of such occurrence and cooperate in filing with the applicable
Governmental Body such amendment or supplement.

 

 

(d) Each party shall use reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be
taken, all appropriate actions, do or cause to be done all things necessary,
proper or advisable, and execute and deliver such documents and other papers,
as may be required to carry out the provisions of this Agreement, to satisfy
the conditions to Closing and to consummate and make effective
the transactions contemplated herein and, without limiting the generality of
the foregoing, each party: (i) shall prepare and make all filings (if any)
and give all notices (if any) required to be made, pre- or post- Closing,
whether triggered by actions of the Purchaser or otherwise, and given by such
party in connection with the transactions contemplated herein; and (ii) shall
use reasonable best efforts to obtain each consent, clearance or approval (if
any) required to be obtained (pursuant to any applicable Requirements of Law
or Contract, or otherwise) by such party in connection with the transactions
contemplated herein, including, but not limited to: (A) entering into
negotiations with any applicable Governmental Body; (B) providing information
required by law or governmental regulation; and (C) substantially complying
with any "second request" or other requests for information pursuant to
Antitrust Law.

 

 

(e) The Purchaser and Seller shall cooperate with each other and use their
respective reasonable best efforts or cause their respective Affiliates
to use reasonable best efforts, with the other\'s cooperation, to negotiate
and obtain all waivers, permits, consents or sublicenses from any Person
(other than from a Governmental Body) and provide any notices necessary or
appropriate to consummate the transactions contemplated herein (each, a
"Third Party Consent"). If the parties are unable to obtain any such
Third Party Consent prior to the Closing, the Seller and the Purchaser shall
continue to use their reasonable best efforts and cause their respective
Affiliates to use their respective reasonable best efforts in cooperation
with the other party (i) to obtain such Third Party Consent or
(ii) cooperate in any arrangement acceptable to the Purchaser that is
reasonable, lawful and designed to provide such benefits to the Purchaser
(including, but not limited to the acquisition of a commercially reasonable
substitute contract for any Contract that has not been transferred with or to
the Company). Following the Closing, the costs of obtaining any Third Party
Consents that the parties were unable to obtain prior to the Closing will be
equally split between the Seller and the Purchaser.

 

 

(f) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Section 6.06
or elsewhere in this Agreement, if any administrative or judicial action or
proceeding is instituted (or threatened to be instituted) challenging any
transaction contemplated by this Agreement as violative of any Antitrust Law,
the parties shall use their reasonable best efforts to: (i) contest, resist
or resolve any such proceeding or action; and (ii) to have vacated, lifted,
reversed or overturned any injunction resulting from such proceeding or
action; provided, however, that neither party shall be required to enter into
any divestiture agreement to comply with its

 


 

 

 

 

 

 

 

34  

 

 

 

 

 


 

obligations hereunder, to the extent that any divestiture is reasonably
likely to have a Material Adverse Effect on the Business or a material
adverse effect on the business of the Purchaser and its Affiliates.

 

 

Section 6.07   Registered Agent. The Purchaser has appointed CT Corporation
System as its registered agent for service of process on such Person in the
State of Delaware.

 

 

Section 6.08 Employees.

 

 

(a) No later than the tenth business day prior to the Closing (as estimated
in good faith by the Purchaser), the Purchaser shall identify in writing to
the Seller which of the Company employees listed on Section 6.08(a) of the
Seller\'s Disclosure Letter (the "Senior Employees") it does not wish to
employ following Closing (the Senior Employees so identified, the
"Terminating Employees"). In addition, no later than the tenth business day
prior to the Closing (as estimated in good faith by the Purchaser), the
Purchaser shall identify in writing to the Seller which of the Senior
Employees it wishes to employ for a limited transition period (up to
180-days) immediately following Closing (the Senior Employees so identified,
the "Transition Employees" and, together with the Terminating Employees,
the "Specified Employees").

 

 

(b) Effective immediately prior to the Closing, the Seller shall cause the
Company to terminate the employment by the Company of each
Terminating Employee. In connection therewith, the Seller shall cause the
Company to pay to each such Terminating Employee all amounts due to
such Terminating Employee pursuant to any change in control or employment
agreements between the Company and the Terminating Employee and any
Company Benefit Plan in which the Terminating Employee participates
(including all amounts that have become due or will become due under any such
Company Benefit Plan as a result of the pending Closing)
("Terminating Employee Payments") and shall use its reasonable best efforts,
and shall cause the Company to use its reasonable best efforts, to obtain
(but without having to pay any increased consideration) a full and final
release of any and all current and future claims of each such Terminating
Employee against the Company or any of its Affiliates (a "Release") in a form
reasonably acceptable to the Purchaser. Effective no later than 180 days
following the Closing, the Purchaser shall cause the Company to terminate the
employment by the Company of each Transition Employee and the Purchaser
shall notify the Seller in writing when such terminations occur. In
connection therewith, the Purchaser shall cause the Company to pay to each
such Transition Employee all amounts due to such Transition Employee pursuant
to any change in control or employment agreements between the Company and the
Transition Employee as in effect immediately prior to the Closing and any
Company Benefit Plan in which the Transition Employee
participates immediately prior to Closing that have not otherwise been paid
at Closing pursuant to Section 6.08(e) of this Agreement
("Transition Employee Payments" and, together with the Terminating Employee
Payments, the "Termination Payments") and shall use its reasonable best
efforts, and shall cause the Company to use its reasonable best efforts, to
obtain (but without having to pay any increased consideration) a Release
from each such Transition Employee in a form reasonably acceptable to the
Seller.

 

 

(c) Immediately following Closing, each Employee (other than the Specified
Employees) (the "Continuing Employees") shall continue to be employed by
the Company.

 


 

 

 

 

 

 

 

35  

 

 

 

 

 


 

Each Continuing Employee shall be given credit for all purposes for such
person\'s service with the Company (or any other employer to the extent
credited by the Company) to the same extent recognized under the Company
Benefit Plans prior to the Closing Date for all purposes under any employee
benefit plans, programs, policies or arrangements maintained by the Purchaser
or its affiliates ("Purchaser Benefit Plans") in which Continuing
Employees participate following the Closing Date, except to the extent that
giving such service credit would result in the duplication of benefits for
the same period. The Purchaser shall, and shall cause its Affiliates to,
(i) waive all limitations as to preexisting conditions, exclusions and
waiting periods and service requirements with respect to participation and
coverage requirements applicable to the Continuing Employees under any
Purchaser Benefit Plan, other than limitations, waiting periods or service
requirements that are already in effect with respect to such persons and that
have not been satisfied as of the Closing under any Company Benefit Plan
immediately prior to the Closing and (ii) provide each Continuing Employee
with credit for any co-payments and deductibles paid prior to the Closing for
the calendar year in which the Closing occurs in satisfying any applicable
deductible or out-of-pocket requirements under any analogous Purchaser
Benefit Plan.

 

 

(d) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, the Purchaser
shall or shall cause the Company to provide each Continuing Employee (other
than Senior Employees) whose employment terminates in a manner entitling such
Continuing Employee to severance benefits during the two year period
following the Closing with severance benefits at levels comparable to the
terms of the Company\'s severance plan applicable to such Continuing
Employee immediately prior to the Closing.

 

 

(e) Effective immediately preceding the Closing, (i) the Seller shall cause
the Company to terminate all of the Company Benefit Plans sponsored by the
Company, other than (A) the Company Benefit Plans listed on
Section 6.08(e)(i) of the Seller\'s Disclosure Letter, and (B) unless
otherwise agreed to by the applicable Senior Employee, any change in control
or employment agreements between the Company and any of the Transition
Employees or Continuing Employees (together with the plans listed on Section
6.08(e)(i) of the Seller\'s Disclosure Letter, the "Continuing Plans"), and
(ii) the Seller shall, or shall cause the Company to accelerate the vesting
of any outstanding awards or benefits under the Company Benefit Plans (or
portions thereof) listed on Section 6.08(e)(ii) of the Seller\'s Disclosure
Letter (the "Accelerated Plans"). Immediately prior to Closing, the Seller
or its Affiliates shall, or shall cause the Company, to pay all accelerated
amounts and any other amounts then otherwise payable under the Accelerated
Plans (including all amounts that have become due or will become due
thereunder as a result of the Closing disregarding any Specified Employee\'s
termination of employment prior to the Closing in accordance with the
provisions of Section 6.08(a)) ("Company Plan Payments") to the extent such
payment does not result in an accelerated or additional tax under Section
409A of the Internal Revenue Code. To the extent any Company Plan Payment is
not paid immediately prior to the Closing, the Purchaser shall cause the
Company to pay any such payments in accordance with the terms of the
applicable Company Benefit Plan (without regard to any forfeiture provisions
contained in the applicable Company Benefit Plan).

 


 

 

 

 

 

 

 

36  

 

 

 

 

 


 

(f) The Purchaser agrees to cause the Company to assume and honor the
obligations under the Parent Nonqualified Deferred Compensation Plan with
respect to any Senior Employee who continues employment with the Company
as of Closing pursuant to the terms set forth in such plan and any existing
election made by the Senior Employee in accordance with the plan (including,
without limitation, existing elections relating to compensation earned after
the Closing). The Purchaser shall indemnify, defend and hold harmless the
Seller and its Affiliates from and against, and pay or reimburse the Seller
and its Affiliates for, any and all Losses relating to or arising from any
failure by the Company to honor its obligations set forth in this Section
6.08(f) of the Agreement. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary,
nothing contained herein shall obligate the Purchaser or the Company to
provide the Continuing Employees or the Transition Employees the opportunity
to make additional deferral elections after the Closing.

 

 

(g) Prior to Closing, the Seller or its Affiliates (other than the Company\'s
Subsidiary) shall contribute to the Company funds in an amount equal to the
sum of (i) the aggregate amount of all Company Plan Payments and all
Termination Payments (without duplication), (ii) the amount accrued as of the
Closing Date on the financial statements of the Company in respect of the
Parent Nonqualified Deferred Compensation Plan, (iii) except as set forth in
Section 6.08(g) of the Seller\'s Disclosure Letter, amounts accrued, payable
or that will become payable as a result of the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement under any Company Benefit Plan that relates to bonuses,
incentive compensation or deferred compensation (other than any Continuing
Plan and without duplication of amounts to be contributed under Subsections
(i) and (ii) above) and (iv) amounts payable by the Company, if
any, pursuant to Section 6.01(a)(i) of the Seller\'s Disclosure Letter
(collectively, the "Contributed Funds"), in each case regardless of whether
such payments are to be made prior to or following Closing; provided,
however, that contributions in respect of amounts payable after Closing shall
be made on an after-tax basis and, provided further, that contributions in
respect of Transition Employees shall not exceed amounts that would have been
contributed had such employee been designated as a Terminating Employee.

 

 

(h) Except as provided in Section 6.08(a) with respect to
Transition Employees, for a period of two years following the Closing Date,
neither the Purchaser, the Company, nor any of their respective Affiliates
shall employ any of the Specified Employees unless (i) the Purchaser or one
of its Affiliates notifies the Seller when it intends to employ any
Specified Employee and (ii) the Purchaser or one of its Affiliates reimburses
the Seller for any Termination Payments contributed to the Company by the
Seller in respect of such Specified Employee that would not have been paid to
such Specified Employee absent the employee\'s identification as a
Specified Employee. The Seller shall be responsible for providing or
discharging any and all notifications, benefits and liabilities to employees
and governmental authorities required by the Worker Adjustment and Retraining
Notification Act of 1988 or any similar applicable state or local law
requiring notice to employees in the event of a closing or layoff (the
"WARN Act") before the Closing.

 

 

(i) With effect from the Closing, the Seller shall indemnify, defend and hold
harmless the Purchaser and its Affiliates (including the Company) from and
against, and pay or reimburse the Purchaser and such Affiliates for, any and
all Losses as incurred (including Losses

 


 

 

 

 

 

 

 

37  

 

 

 

 

 


 

incurred indirectly by the Purchaser and such Affiliates resulting from the
failure of the Seller or its Affiliates to contribute all or any of the
Contributed Funds to the Company as required by this Agreement) relating
to or arising from any Company Benefit Plan pursuant to which a Termination
Payment or a Company Plan Payment was required, to the extent that there are
not Contributed Funds (as increased to reflect any tax benefits to be
received by the Purchaser) made available at the Closing to satisfy the
obligations relating to such Losses. In addition, the Seller shall
indemnify, defend, and hold harmless the Purchaser and its Affiliates
(including the Company) from and against, and pay or reimburse the Purchaser
and such Affiliates for, any and all Losses as incurred relating to or
arising from claims set forth on Section 6.08(i) of the Seller\'s Disclosure
Letter.

 

 

(j) With effect from the Closing, the Purchaser shall indemnify, defend and
hold harmless the Seller and its Affiliates from and against, and pay or
reimburse the Seller and its Affiliates for, any and all Losses as incurred
relating to or arising from the failure of the Purchaser to cause the Company
to use the Contributed Funds (as increased to reflect any tax benefits to be
received by the Purchaser) to satisfy the Company\'s obligations under any
Company Benefit Plan pursuant to which a Termination Payment or a Company
Plan Payment was required or relating to or arising from any failure by the
Company to honor its obligations under the Continuing Plans.

 

 

(k) Nothing contained in this Agreement shall give any third Person any right
to enforce the provisions of this Section 6.08 or be construed as an
amendment of any employee benefit plan.

 

 

Section 6.09   Termination of Certain Agreements

 

 

. Except as set forth on Section 6.09 of the Seller\'s Disclosure Letter or
in Section 6.08(e) of this Agreement, all agreements between the Seller or
any Affiliate of the Seller (other than the Company and its Subsidiary), on
the one hand, and the Company or the Subsidiary, on the other hand, shall be
terminated as of the Closing, and all obligations and liabilities thereunder
shall be satisfied on the Closing in accordance with the terms of such
agreements, other than any agreements relating to the indemnification of
current directors, managers, members and/or officers of the Company or its
Subsidiary; provided that the Company shall not pay amounts in excess of
$100,000 in the aggregate in connection with the termination of
such agreements and shall not write off any material assets in connection
with the terms of such agreements.

 

 

Section 6.10   Risk Management.

 

 

(a) During the Pre-Closing Period, the Company will in all material respects
continue to follow the Risk Management Policy in respect of Seller
Significant Contracts and any new Seller Significant Contracts entered into
after the date hereof. In addition, the Company shall use its reasonable
efforts to keep the Purchaser apprised regarding material developments with
respect to a Seller Significant Contract that is subject to the Risk
Management Policy and generally in respect of significant activities subject
to the Risk Management Policy; provided, however, that notwithstanding
anything contained herein to the contrary, the Purchaser shall not be
entitled to direct or manage any decisions or activities of the Company.

 


 

 

 

 

 

 

 

38  

 

 

 

 

 


 

(b) During the Pre-Closing Period, the Company and its Subsidiary will use
commercially reasonable efforts to maintain in effect insurance policies for
the benefit of the Company and its Subsidiary consistent with those
in effect on the date hereof; provided that the Company and the Seller shall
use their commercially reasonable efforts in renewing any such policies to do
so on terms that will result in the Company receiving a reimbursement of its
premium attributable to any post-Closing period following the termination of
such policy.

 

 

Section 6.11 Release of Letters of Credit and Guarantees.

 

 

(a) Prior to the Closing, the Purchaser shall obtain and deliver to the
beneficiary of each Letter of Credit (as defined in this Section 6.11(a))
listed on Section 6.11(a) of the Seller\'s Disclosure Letter (as amended
in accordance with Section 6.11(c) below) a substitute letter of credit or
other form of security acceptable to the beneficiary to replace in all
respects such Letter of Credit, with each substitute letter of credit (or
other security) having a face amount of at least the remaining amount under
the Letter of Credit that it is intended to replace. Prior to the Closing,
and subject to the terms set forth in Section 6.11(d), the Purchaser shall
use its commercially reasonable efforts to obtain from the beneficiary of
each Letter of Credit listed on Section 6.11(a) of the Seller\'s Disclosure
Letter and deliver to the Seller a full and unconditional release of all of
the obligations of the Seller and its applicable Affiliates (other than the
Company or its Subsidiary) with respect to such Letter of Credit (which
release shall be reasonably acceptable to the Seller and may take the form of
a return to the Seller of each such Letter of Credit marked cancelled). In
the event the Purchaser has not, as of the Closing, obtained and delivered
releases with respect to each of the Letters of Credit listed on Section
6.11(a) of the Seller\'s Disclosure Letter in accordance with the
preceding sentence, (1) the Purchaser shall, subject to the terms set forth
in Section 6.11(d), use commercially reasonable efforts to do so following
the Closing and shall indemnify and hold harmless each of the Seller and its
Affiliates (other than the Company and its Subsidiary) from and against any
and all Losses incurred by the Seller or any of its Affiliates arising out of
or relating to such Letter(s) of Credit; (2) the Purchaser shall not permit
any of the Company or its Subsidiary or their Affiliates to (x) renew
or extend the term of, (y) increase the obligations under, or (z) transfer to
another third party, any written or oral contract, loan, agreement,
commitment, franchise, indenture, lease, purchase order, license, other
binding understanding or arrangement or other obligation for which the Seller
or any of its Affiliates is or would reasonably be expected to be liable
under such Letters of Credit; and (3) Purchaser shall pay the
Seller, quarterly, a fee, consistent with current practice, of 0.475% of the
principal amount of the Letters of Credit outstanding from time to time.
Nothing contained herein shall require the Seller to renew any Letter of
Credit following the Closing whether pursuant to an evergreen provision or
otherwise. For the purposes of this Agreement, "Letters of Credit" shall
mean, collectively, all letters of credit issued in connection with the
Business for which the Seller or any of its Affiliates (other than the
Company and its Subsidiary) is an applicant. The Letters of Credit, to the
extent existing as of the date hereof, are set forth in Section 6.11(a) of
the Seller\'s Disclosure Letter.

 

 

(b) Prior to the Closing, the Purchaser shall obtain and deliver to each
beneficiary of a Guarantee (as defined in this Section 6.11(b)) listed on
Section 6.11(b) of the Seller\'s Disclosure Letter a substitute guarantee or
other form of security acceptable to the beneficiary to replace in all
respects such Guarantee (provided that the Purchaser shall not be

 


 

 

 

 

 

 

 

39  

 

 

 

 

 


 

required to issue (or have issued on its behalf) any performance guarantees),
with each substitute guarantee (or other security) having terms and
conditions substantially similar to those contained in the Guarantee that it
is intended to replace. Prior to the Closing, and subject to the terms set
forth in Section 6.11(d), the Purchaser shall use its commercially reasonable
efforts to obtain from the beneficiary of each Guarantee listed on Section
6.11(b) of the Seller\'s Disclosure Letter and deliver to the Seller a full
and unconditional release of all of the obligations of the Seller and
its applicable Affiliates (other than the Company or its Subsidiary) with
respect to such Guarantee (which release shall be reasonably acceptable to
the Seller). In the event the Purchaser has not, as of the
Closing, delivered releases with respect to each of the Guarantees listed on
Section 6.11(b) of the Seller\'s Disclosure Letter in accordance with the
preceding sentence, (1) the Purchaser shall, subject to the terms set
forth in Section 6.11(d), use commercially reasonable efforts to do so
following the Closing and, in any event, shall indemnify and hold harmless
each of the Seller and its Affiliates (other than the Company or its
Subsidiary) from and against any and all Losses incurred by the Seller or any
of its Affiliates arising out of or relating to such Guarantees, (2) the
Purchaser shall not permit any of the Company or its Subsidiary or their
Affiliates to (x) renew or extend the term of, (y) increase the obligations
under, or (z) transfer to another third party, any written or oral contract,
loan, agreement, commitment, franchise, indenture, lease, purchase order,
license, other binding understanding or arrangement or other obligation for
which the Seller or any of its Affiliates is or would reasonably be expected
to be liable under such Guarantees, and (3) Purchaser shall pay the Seller,
quarterly, a fee, consistent with current practice, of 0.10% of the amount of
the obligations guaranteed. To the extent that the Seller or any of its
Affiliates has performance obligations under any Guarantee, the Purchaser
shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to (i) perform such obligations
on behalf of the Seller or its Affiliates if practicable, or (ii) otherwise
take such action as reasonably requested by the Seller so as to put the
Seller or its Affiliates in the same position as if the Purchaser, and not
the Seller or such Affiliates, had performed or was performing such
obligations. For the purposes of this Agreement, "Guarantees" shall mean,
collectively, those indemnities, performance bonds, surety bonds, performance
guaranties, other guaranty obligations, keepwells, net worth maintenance
agreements, reimbursement obligations, letters of comfort and other similar
arrangements to which the Seller or any of its Affiliates (other than the
Company and its Subsidiary) is a party or by which any of them are bound in
favor of, or for the benefit of, any of the Company or its Subsidiary or the
Business (other than the Letters of Credit). All Guarantees, to the extent
existing as of the date hereof, are set forth in Section 6.11(b) of
the Seller\'s Disclosure Letter.

 

 

(c) The Seller agrees that, with respect to Sections 6.11(a) and 6.11(b) of
the Seller\'s Disclosure Letter, the Seller shall have the continuing
obligation until the Closing to supplement or amend promptly such sections
of the Seller\'s Disclosure Letter with respect to any Letters of Credit or
Guarantees, as the case may be, which, if existing at the date of this
Agreement, would have been required to be set forth in Section 6.11(a) or
6.11(b), respectively, and to provide such supplements or amendments to the
Purchaser once per week.

 

 

(d) Notwithstanding anything contained in this Agreement (including this
Section 6.11) to the contrary, in no event shall the Purchaser be required to
cause the Company or any Subsidiary thereof to amend, modify or supplement
the terms and conditions set forth in any written or oral contract,
agreement, commitment, franchise, indenture, lease, purchase order,

 


 

 

 

 

 

 

 

40  

 

 

 

 

 


 

license or other binding understanding or arrangement that relates to any
Letter of Credit or any Guarantee. Except as expressly set forth in this
Agreement, and notwithstanding anything contained in this Agreement
(including this Section 6.11) to the contrary, none of the Purchaser, the
Seller, the Company or any of their respective Affiliates shall be obligated
to make any payments or otherwise pay any consideration to any third party to
obtain any applicable consent, waiver or approval.

 

 

Section 6.12 Allocation of Consideration.

 

 

(a) Within 45 business days after the Closing Date, the Purchaser shall
propose to the Seller an allocation of the Purchase Price, including
liabilities of the Company required to be taken into account for United
States federal income tax purposes (together, the "Consideration"), among the
assets of the Company pursuant to Section 1060 of the Code (the
"Preliminary Allocation"). Within 20 business days following the receipt of
the Preliminary Allocation, the Seller shall provide to the Purchaser either
(i) a written notice evidencing the Purchaser\'s consent to the
Preliminary Allocation or (ii) a written notice objecting to the Preliminary
Allocation, such notice to contain an explanation of the reasons for the
Seller\'s objections. Within 5 business days following receipt of the
Seller\'s objections, if any, to the Preliminary Allocation
(the "Allocation Resolution Period"), the Seller and the Purchaser
shall negotiate in good faith to resolve any differences regarding the
Preliminary Allocation (as so resolved, the "Final Allocation") for a period
of 30 days after the receipt of the Seller\'s objections.

 

 

(b) If the Seller and the Purchaser are unable to resolve any differences
with regard to the allocation of the Consideration with the
Allocation Resolution Period, then any disputed matters shall be finally and
conclusively determined in accordance with Section 1060 of the Code by an
independent nationally-recognized accounting firm (the
"Independent Accounting Firm") chosen by the Seller and the Purchaser.
Promptly, but not later than 15 business days after its acceptance of
appointment hereunder, the Independent Accounting Firm shall determine only
those matters in dispute and shall render a written report as to the disputed
matters and the resulting allocation of the Consideration, and such report of
the Independent Accounting Firm shall be final, conclusive and binding upon
the Seller and the Purchaser and deemed to be the Final Allocation. The
Independent Accounting Firm\'s fees and expenses incurred pursuant to this
Section 6.12(b) shall be borne equally by the Seller and the Purchaser.

 

 

(c) The Purchaser and the Company shall (A) be bound by the Final Allocation
for all income Tax purposes, (B) timely file all forms and Tax Returns
required to be filed in connection with the Final Allocation (including IRS
Form 8594 and any other forms or reports required to be filed pursuant
to Section 1060 of the Code or any comparable Requirements of Law (the
"Section 1060 Forms")), (C) prepare and file all Section 1060 Forms and Tax
Returns in a manner consistent with the Final Allocation and (D) take no
position inconsistent with the Final Allocation in any Section 1060 Form or
Tax Return, any audit or examination by, or any proceeding before, any taxing
authority or otherwise.

discharged in full and any and all security interests related

 


 

 

 

 

 

 

 

41  

 

 

 

 

 


 

thereto to be released. With regard to the Receivables Facility (as
defined in this Section 6.13(a)), the Seller shall use its reasonable best
efforts to have the Company coordinate with its lenders to obtain a waiver of
the 30 day advance notice provision therein and, thereby, facilitate a
satisfaction and discharge of such Receivables Facility immediately prior to
the Closing. If the Company is able to obtain the cooperation of
its lenders, the Seller shall cause the Receivables Facility to be repaid,
satisfied and discharged in full and any and all security interests related
thereto to be released as of, or immediately prior to, the Closing. If
the Company is not able to obtain the cooperation of its lenders, the Seller
shall cause the Company to have delivered to its lenders an irrevocable
notice of termination of the Receivables Facility immediately prior
to Closing. Any outstanding Letters of Credit issued under the Receivables
Facility shall be replaced in accordance with Section 6.11 prior to Closing.
To the extent such Letters of Credit are not replaced prior to Closing, the
Purchaser will provide, at Closing (or if termination of the applicable
facility is later, such termination date), cash, or if acceptable to the
lenders, a letter of credit, replacement guaranty or other credit
support reasonably acceptable to the lenders, sufficient to satisfy any
deposit requirements under the Receivables Facility, the amount of which
shall be adjustable based on the amount of deposit exposure that exists from
time to time and as provided in such facility. For purposes of this
Agreement, "Revolver Facility" shall mean the $50,000,000 Revolving Credit
Facility Credit Agreement dated as of October 3, 2007 by and among Strategic
Energy, L.L.C., the Lenders party thereto and PNC Bank, National Association,

thereto, the LC Participants from time to time party thereto, and PNC Bank,

to time a party thereto, Strategic Energy, L.L.C., as Servicer, and Strategic

such term is defined in the Receivables Purchase Agreement). Amounts
outstanding, as of March 31, 2008, under the Revolver Facility and the
Receivables Facility, respectively, are set forth in Section 6.13 of the
Seller\'s Disclosure Letter.

 

 

Section 6.14 Books and Records. The Seller shall deliver all existing
financial, customer, employee, engineering, operating, accounting, tax,
contract, environmental, safety, legal, marketing and other data, files,
computer tapes and discs, documents, instruments, notes, papers, books and
records that relate to the ownership or operation of the Company and its
Subsidiary (the "Books and Records) in the possession of the Seller or any
of its Affiliates as soon as possible after the Closing, but in any event
no later than fifteen days after the Closing, provided that the Seller may

with (a) the preparation of financial statements of the Seller or the Parent
and (b) the preparation and filing of any tax returns.

to applicable confidentiality protections and consistent with Requirements of
Law, the Seller and the Purchaser shall, and the Seller shall cause the
Company to, cooperate on transition matters in order to facilitate the
transition of the Company from the ownership of the Seller to the ownership
of the Purchaser, including to provide reasonable access to their employees.

 

 

Section 6.17 Amendment of Company LLC Agreement. On or prior to Closing,
the Seller and the Purchaser shall, and the Seller shall cause the Company
to, cooperate to execute an amendment and restatement of the Company LLC
Agreement, which shall become effective upon Closing, to reflect the
Purchaser as the sole member and the owner of record of all of the
outstanding Membership Interests in the Company and remove each reference to
the Series SEL Voting Interest in CE (or its holders) in the Company LLC
Agreement.

 

 

Section 6.18   Amendment of Disclosure Letter. The Seller agrees that,
with respect to the representations and warranties of the Seller contained in
this Agreement, the Seller shall have the continuing obligation until the
Closing to supplement or amend the Seller\'s Disclosure Letter with respect
to any matter hereafter arising or discovered which, if existing or known at
the date of this Agreement, would have been required to be set forth or
described in the Seller\'s Disclosure Letter; provided that, other than
Sections 6.11(a) and (b) of the Seller\'s Disclosure Letter, the Seller\'s
Disclosure Letter shall be deemed to include only that information contained
therein on the date hereof and shall be deemed to exclude all information
contained in any supplement or amendment hereto. The Seller shall deliver

(a) mutual written consent of the Seller and the Purchaser;

 

 

(b) either the Seller or the Purchaser, upon written notice given to such

which is the four month anniversary of the date hereof (the "Outside Date");
provided, however, that if the Seller or the Purchaser determine that

the Outside Date may be extended by the Seller or the Purchaser (provided

45  

 

 

 

 

 


 

Seller has failed, or to the Purchaser if the Purchaser has failed, to
perform in all material respects their/its obligations (as applicable) under

failure of the Closing to occur on or before the Outside Date;

 

 

(c) either the Seller or the Purchaser, if any Governmental Body shall have
issued an order, decree or ruling or taken any other action (which order,
decree, ruling or other action the parties hereto shall use commercially

agreement contained herein), at any time if there shall have been a material
breach of any of the representations, warranties, agreements or covenants set
forth in this Agreement on the part of the Purchaser or on the part of the

TAX MATTERS

 

 



 

 

Section 9.01 Tax Indemnity.

 

 

(a) Notwithstanding any other provision in this Agreement to the contrary,
the Seller shall be liable for, will pay, will defend, and will indemnify and
hold the Purchaser Indemnified Parties harmless against any and all (i) Taxes
imposed on the Seller or Parent; (ii) Taxes imposed on or payable with
respect to either the Company, its Subsidiary or their respective
businesses, operations, property, or assets that relate to, arise out of or
are attributable to any Tax period (or portion thereof) ending on or prior to
the Financial Closing Date (the "Pre-Financial Closing Period"), except to
the extent such Taxes are included in the calculation of Closing Working
Capital; (iii) Taxes of a Person other than the Company or its Subsidiary for
which the Company may be liable (A) under Section 1.1502-6 of the Treasury
Regulations (or any similar provision of state, local, or non- U.S. Tax Law)
as a result of being a member of or included in any group which files or has
filed a Tax Return on a consolidated, combined, group or unitary basis for a
taxable period ending on or before the Closing Date, (B) as a transferee or
(C) as a successor; (iv) except as provided in Section 9.01(b), Taxes
resulting from or attributable to the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement; (v) Losses relating to, arising out of, or resulting from
the breach of any covenants or agreements relating to Tax matters set forth
in this Agreement (determined without regard to any matters set forth in the

relating to the review, investigation, remediation, settlement, contest,
adjudication and analysis of any matter relating to the Taxes and Losses
described in clauses (i) - (iv) (collectively clauses (i) - (vi), "Excluded

such period ending as of and including the Financial Closing Date shall be
computed in accordance with Section 9.01(c).

 

 

(b) Anything herein to the contrary notwithstanding, each of the Purchaser
and the Seller will be responsible for one-half of any and all Transfer Taxes
that may be imposed with respect to the sale of the equity interest in the
Company to the Purchaser pursuant to this Agreement, regardless of the Person
liable for such Transfer Taxes under applicable Law. The Seller and the
Purchaser will use commercially reasonable efforts to minimize the amount of
such transfer Taxes and shall cooperate in timely making all filings,
returns, reports and forms as may be required to comply with the provisions
of such Tax Laws.

 

 

(c) For purposes of Section 9.01, in the case of Taxes that are payable with
respect to a Straddle Period, the portion of any such Tax that is allocable

(i)  in the case of Taxes (other than Taxes imposed on the Seller) that are
either (x) based upon or related to income or receipts or (y) imposed in
connection with any sale or other transfer or assignment of property (real or
personal, tangible or intangible), deemed equal to the

 


 

 

 

 

 

 

 

47  

 

 

 

 

 


 

amount which would be payable if the taxable year ended on and included the
Financial Closing Date; and

 

 

(ii)   in the case of Taxes imposed on a periodic basis, or otherwise
measured by the level of any item, deemed to be the amount of such Taxes for
the entire period (or, in the case of such Taxes determined on an arrears
basis, the amount of such Taxes for the immediately preceding period),
multiplied by a fraction the numerator of which is the number of calendar
days in the period ending on and including the Financial Closing Date and
the denominator of which is the number of calendar days in the
entire period.

 

 

(d) Except as otherwise provided, payment by a party of any amount due under
this Section 9.01 will be made within 10 days following written notice from
the other party that payment of such amount is due.

cause the Company to prepare and file all other Tax Returns of or that
include the Company and its Subsidiary in a timely manner. At least 15 days
prior to the Closing Date, the Seller shall provide written notice to the
Purchaser of any Tax Return that the Purchaser is required to file (or cause
to be filed) within 60 days of the Closing Date pursuant to this Section
9.02(a).

 

 

(b) With respect to any Tax Return required to be filed (or caused to be
filed) by (1) the Company pursuant to Section 9.02(a) on or prior to the
Closing Date, or (2) the Purchaser pursuant to Section 9.02(a) which includes
a payment of Tax that is an Excluded Tax Liability (the party required
to file such Tax Return, the "Filing Party"), the Filing Party shall
provide to the other party a copy of such completed Tax Return or in the case
of a Consolidated Tax Return, a pro forma Tax Return that includes the
Company (prepared on a separate company basis) and with respect to Tax
Returns described in clause (2) herein a statement certifying and setting
forth the calculation of the amount of Tax shown on any such Tax Return that
is payable by the Seller at least 60 days prior to the due date of such Tax
Return. Such other party shall have the right to review and comment on any
such Tax Return and statement prior to the filing of such Tax Return. To the
extent there is any dispute between the parties with respect to any such Tax
Return the parties will use reasonable efforts to settle such disputes for a
period of 20 days after the other party has notified the Filing Party in
writing of its objections (such notification to contain
sufficient specificity so as to allow the Filing Party to understand the
nature and basis of such objection). To the extent any such disputes cannot
be resolved such disputed items shall be presented to the Independent
Accounting Firm to settle such disputed items. The decision of such
Independent Accounting Firm shall be final and binding on the parties except
to the extent of a final determination by a Tax authority or court that is
contrary thereto. The cost of such Independent Accounting Firm shall be shared
equally by the Purchaser and the Seller.

due and payable in the manner prescribed by applicable law all Taxes properly
shown on a Tax Return that the other party is required to file (or cause to
be filed) pursuant to the terms of this Section 9.02. In any case where a
party is required to pay an amount of Tax which includes an amount that is

the amount of such Tax to the other party no later than 10 days prior to the
date when the other party is required to pay such Tax.

 

 

Section 9.03 Cooperation. The Seller and the Purchaser shall reasonably
cooperate, and shall cause their respective Affiliates, officers, employees,
agents, auditors and representatives reasonably to cooperate, with respect to
all Tax matters relating to the Company including with respect to preparing
and filing all Tax Returns or conducting the defense of any Tax Claim,
including maintaining and making available to each other (subject to Section
9.01, at the cost of the requesting party) all records necessary in
connection with Taxes and in resolving all disputes and audits with respect
to all taxable periods relating to Taxes.

 

 

Section 9.04 Tax Sharing Agreements. Any Tax sharing or Tax allocation
agreement entered into by the Company and any power of attorney granted by
the Seller or the Company prior to the Closing Date with respect to Tax
matters shall be terminated as of the Closing Date and will have no further
effect thereafter (whether the current year, a future year, or a past year).

 

 

Section 9.05   Tax Contests.

 

 

(a) If any Tax authority asserts or proposes to assess an amount of Tax that
is an Excluded Tax Liability, then the party hereto first receiving notice of
such claim promptly will provide written notice thereof to the other party
hereto (such notice to include a copy of any correspondence, report, or other
material provided by the relevant Governmental Body and such notice to provide
a full and specific description of the matter in controversy, the tax years
which are in question, the amount of the assessment (proposed or otherwise)
and any other information or detail that is relevant to such claim);
provided, however, that the failure of such party to give such prompt notice
will not relieve the other party of any of its obligations under this
Article IX, except to the extent that the other party is materially
prejudiced thereby.

 

 

(b) The Seller will have the right to control, at its own expense, any audit,
examination, contest, litigation or other proceeding by or against any
Governmental Body relating to Taxes (a "Tax Proceeding") that solely involves
an Excluded Tax Liability. With respect to a Tax Proceeding relating to a
potential adjustment for which Seller or one of its Affiliates on the one
hand, and Purchaser or the Company on the other hand, could be liable, (i)
each party may participate in the Tax Proceeding, and (ii) the Tax Proceeding
shall be controlled by that party which would bear the burden of the greater
portion of the sum of the adjustment and any corresponding adjustments that
may reasonably be anticipated for future Tax periods to arise from such Tax
Proceeding. All other Tax Proceedings shall be controlled by the Purchaser.

 

 

(c) None of the Seller, the Company and the Purchaser shall enter into
any compromise or agree to settle any claim pursuant to any Tax Proceeding
which would adversely

 


 

 

 

 

 

 

 

49  

 

 

 

 

 


 

affect the other party without the written consent of the other party, which
consent may not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed.

 

 

Section 9.06   Miscellaneous.

 

 

(a) The Purchaser and the Seller agree that for all income and franchise Tax
purposes, the Purchaser\'s acquisition of the interest in the Company shall
be treated as an acquisition by the Purchaser of the assets of the Company
and as an assumption by the Purchaser of the liabilities of the Company and
neither the Purchaser nor the Seller (or any Affiliate thereof) shall take
any position that is contrary or inconsistent thereto.

 

 

(b) The parties agree that all payments made pursuant to this Agreement shall
be treated for Tax purposes as an adjustment to the Purchase Price.

 

 

(c) All covenants set forth in this Article IX shall survive the Closing Date
for a period of 6 months after the expiration of all relevant statute of
limitations.

"Great Plains Group" ), agrees that for a period of sixty calendar months
beginning at the Closing, no member of the Great Plains Group will offer, or
participate through ownership in offering competitive energy supply services
to retail customers within the continental United States; provided, that, the
foregoing restriction shall not prohibit any member of the Great Plains Group
(now or hereafter existing) from engaging in any business activity in the
states of Kansas or Missouri.

 

 

(b) The Seller, for itself and on behalf of its Affiliates, acknowledges and
agree that the restrictions set forth in this Section 10.01 are reasonably
designed to protect the Purchaser\'s substantial investment and
are reasonable with respect to duration, geographical area and scope.

defend and hold harmless the Purchaser and its Affiliates from and against,
and pay or reimburse the Purchaser and its Affiliates for, any and all Losses
as incurred (including Losses incurred indirectly by the Purchaser resulting
from the failure of the Seller to contribute funds to the Company as required
by this Agreement), relating to or arising from:

 

 

(a) the breach or inaccuracy of any of the representations or warranties of
the Seller, the Company or its Subsidiary contained in this Agreement (other
than those contained in

 


 

 

 

 

 

 

 

50  

 

 

 

 

 


 

Section 5.12) or in any agreement or document delivered pursuant hereto or in
connection herewith, or arising out of the consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby;

 

 

(b) the failure to comply with any covenants or agreements of the Seller,
the Company or its Subsidiary contained in this Agreement, or in

herewith, or arising out of the consummation of the transactions contemplated
hereby, other than with respect to matters subject to indemnification
pursuant to Section 6.08(which shall be governed by such Section);

 

 

(c) any of the matters set forth on Section 5.14 of the Seller\'s Disclosure
Letter or, to the extent that the Purchaser shall have given notice of
such matters prior to the date which is the eighteenth month anniversary of
the Closing, that should have been set forth in Section 5.14 of the
Seller\'s Disclosure Letter in order to make the representations and
warranties in Section 5.14 in this Agreement true and correct; and

 

 

(d) any funds advanced by the Company pursuant to the Contracts required to
be set forth in the Seller\'s Disclosure Letter pursuant to
Section 5.11(i)(3) of this Agreement becoming Uncollectible on or prior to
the date that is eighteen (18) months after the date of this Agreement. For
the purposes of this clause (d), (1) advanced funds shall be deemed
"Uncollectible" if (A) the Person obligated to repay such advanced funds to
the Company has taken any Bankruptcy Action (as defined below), or (B) the
advanced funds are more than 90 days past due, and (2) the term
"Bankruptcy Action" means, with respect to any Person: (A) an admission
in writing by such Person of its inability to pay its debts generally or a
general assignment by such Person for the benefit of creditors; or (B) the
filing of any petition by such Person seeking to adjudicate it bankrupt or
insolvent, or seeking for itself any liquidation, winding up, reorganization,
arrangement, adjustment, protection, relief, or composition of such Person or
its debts under any applicable law relating to bankruptcy, insolvency or
reorganization or relief of debtors, or seeking, consenting to,
or acquiescing in the entry of an order for relief or the appointment of
a receiver, trustee, custodian or other similar official for such Person or
for any substantial part of its property or the filing of an answer or
other pleading admitting or failing to contest the allegations of a petition
filed against it in any proceeding of the foregoing nature; it being
understood that the Purchaser will (1) cause the Company to use its
reasonable efforts to collect such funds in accordance with its normal
collection practices, including exercising any rights to offset commissions
which the Person obligated to repay such advanced funds to the Company may be
due from time to time in accordance with its agreements with the Company, and
(2) reimburse the Seller for any amounts paid to the Purchaser hereunder to
the extent that the Company is able to collect from such Person or offset
against commissions due.

 

 

Section 11.02 Indemnification by the Purchaser

 

 

. The Purchaser shall indemnify, defend and hold harmless the Seller from any
against, and pay or reimburse the Seller for, any and all Losses as incurred,
relating to or arising from:

 

 

(a) the breach or inaccuracy of any of the representations or warranties of
the Purchaser contained in this Agreement or in any agreement or document
delivered pursuant hereto or in connection herewith, or arising out of the
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby; or

 


 

 

 

 

 

 

 

51  

 

 

 

 

 


 



 

 

(b) the failure to comply with any covenants or agreements of the Purchaser
contained in this Agreement or in any agreement or document delivered

governed by such Section).

 

 

Section 11.03 Limitations on Indemnity.

 

 

(a) The Seller shall not be liable under Section 11.01 with respect to the
matters set forth in clause (a) thereof, unless and until the aggregate
amount of Losses with respect to such matters exceeds $2,500,000, at which
time the Seller shall be liable for Losses in excess of $2,500,000, and the
Seller\'s aggregate maximum liability under Section 11.01 with respect to the
matters set forth in clause (a) thereof, will never exceed 50% of the
Purchase Price. The limitations contained in this Section 11.03(a) shall not
limit the liability of the Seller with respect to its indemnification
obligations in respect of any Losses resulting from a breach or inaccuracy of
the representations and warranties set forth in Sections 5.01, 5.02, 5.03,
5.06 and 5.12, or any Losses relating to Taxes, regardless of whether such
Losses are subject to indemnification pursuant to Section 9.01.

 

 

(b) The Purchaser shall not be liable under Section 11.02 with respect to
the matters set forth in clause (a) thereof, unless and until the aggregate
amount of Losses with respect to such matters exceeds $2,500,000, at which
time the Purchaser shall be liable for Losses in excess of $2,500,000, and
the Purchaser\'s aggregate maximum liability under Section 11.02 with respect
to the matters set forth in clause (b) thereof, will never exceed 50% of the

limit the liability of the Purchaser with respect to its indemnification
obligations in respect of any Losses resulting from a breach or inaccuracy of

Section 11.04 Procedures for Indemnification.

 

 

(a) In the event that any claim is asserted against any party hereto, or any
party hereto is made a party defendant in any action or proceeding, and such
claim, action or proceeding involves a matter which is the subject of this
indemnification, then such party (an "Indemnified Party") shall give prompt
written notice to the other party hereto (the "Indemnifying Party") of such
claim, action or proceeding, and such Indemnifying Party shall have the
right to join in the defense of said claim, action or proceeding at such
Indemnifying Party\'s own cost and expense and, if the Indemnifying Party
agrees in writing to be bound by and to promptly pay the full amount of any
final judgment from which no further appeal may be taken (subject to the
provisions of Section 11.03, to the extent applicable), then at the option of
the Indemnifying Party, such Indemnifying Party may take over the defense of
such claim, action or proceeding with counsel reasonably satisfactory to
the Indemnified Party, except that, in such case, the Indemnified Party shall
have the right to join in the defense of said claim, action or proceeding at
its own cost and expense. The Indemnified Party may not settle
any proceeding without the consent of the Indemnifying Party, not to be
unreasonably withheld.

 


 

 

 

 

 

 

 

52  

 

 

 

 

 


 

(b) Any indemnity payments shall be deemed to be an adjustment of the
Purchase Price.

 

 

(c) The provisions of this Section 11.04 shall not apply to matters governed
by Section 11.05.

 

 

Section 11.05 Seller Action Litigation Procedures and Support.

 

 

(a) Following the Closing Date, Seller and the Purchaser (on behalf of the
Company and their respective Subsidiaries) shall promptly notify and confer
with each other with respect to any and all matters subject
to indemnification pursuant to Section 11.01(c) (each, a "Seller Action").

 

 

(b) Except as set forth in this Section 11.05, Seller shall not be required
to indemnify the Purchaser in connection with any claim for indemnification
arising out of or relating to any Seller Action unless and until
the aggregate amount of all such claims by the Purchaser for Seller Actions
exceeds $7,500,000 (the "Deductible"), in which event the Purchaser shall
be entitled to recover such Losses arising out of or relating to such
matters, but only to the extent that the aggregate amount of such Losses
exceeds the Deductible.

 

 

(c) For any Seller Action, if any, that Seller reasonably determines may
result in liability exceeding the Deductible (after taking into account any
other Seller Actions), Seller shall have the right, at its option, to
assume the defense of any such Seller Action with its own legal counsel
reasonably satisfactory to the Purchaser, provided that the Seller agrees in
writing to be bound by and to promptly pay the full amount of any final
judgment from which no further appeal may be taken (subject to the provisions
of Section 11.03(a)). In addition, once the Deductible has been exhausted by
payment (and/or based upon outstanding judgments will be exhausted), Seller
shall have the sole and exclusive authority and control over the
investigation, commencement, prosecution, defense, management, conduct,
appeal, and other rights in connection with all matters whatsoever
(including, as applicable, litigation strategy and choice of legal counsel
and other professionals) in connection with such Seller Action. If the Seller
elects to assume the defense of such Seller Action as aforesaid, then:

 

 

(i)   in connection with the management, defense and disposition of such
Seller Action, each of the Purchaser, the Company and their respective
Subsidiaries shall use their reasonable best efforts to cooperate as
reasonably requested by Seller and make readily available to and afford to
Seller, its employees, authorized legal counsel, accountants, and other
designated representatives reasonable access to their officers,
directors, employees, accountants, financial advisors, legal counsel, agents,
properties and Books and Records, subject to appropriate and reasonable
confidentiality agreements (provided that the terms of any such agreement do
not restrict actions to be taken in connection with the defense of any Seller
Action), to the extent reasonably related to such Seller Action. Without
limiting the generality of the foregoing, each of the Purchaser, the Company
and their respective Subsidiaries shall use their reasonable best

 


 

 

 

 

 

 

 

53  

 

 

 

 

 


 

efforts to make available their officers, directors, employees, accountants,
financial advisors, legal counsel and agents for fact finding, consultation
and interviews, and as witnesses to the extent that any such Person may
reasonably be required in connection with any Seller Action. Access to such
Persons shall be granted for reasonable periods of time during normal
business hours or as otherwise mutually agreed. The provision of access and
other services pursuant to this Section 11.05(c)(i) shall be at no additional
cost or expense of the Seller, other than for reasonable out-of-pocket
expense. To the extent requested, the Seller shall provide its reasonable
cooperation to the Purchaser in connection with any efforts by the Purchaser
to seek a confidentiality order with regard to any information that it deems
to be confidential.

 

 

(ii)   none of the Purchaser, the Company or their Subsidiaries shall admit
any liability with respect to such Seller Action;

 

 

(iii)   Seller may, without consent of the Purchaser, the Company or their
respective Subsidiaries, compromise or settle such Seller Action or consent
to entry of judgment with respect thereto that requires solely money damages
paid by the Seller, and which includes as an unconditional term thereof the
release by the claimant or the plaintiff of the Purchaser, the Company, or
their Subsidiaries, as appropriate, from all liability in connection with
such Seller Action. Any other disposition by Seller of such Seller Action
shall be subject to the consent of the Purchaser, which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld or delayed;

 

 

(iv) notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement,
Seller shall not be required to pay or otherwise indemnify the Purchaser
against any attorneys\' fees incurred by the Purchaser in connection with
such Seller Action following the Seller\'s election to assume the
defense thereof, unless (A) the Seller fails to defend diligently the action
or proceeding within twenty days after receiving notice of such failure from
the Purchaser; (B) the Purchaser reasonably shall have concluded (upon advice
of its legal counsel) that there may be one or more legal defenses available
to the Purchaser that are not available to the Seller; or (C) the Purchaser
reasonably shall have concluded (upon advice of its legal counsel) that, with
respect to such Seller Action, the Purchaser and the Seller may have
different, conflicting, or adverse legal positions or interests.

 

 

(d) If the Seller elects not to assume the defense of any Seller Action prior
to such claims exceeding the Deductible, then the Purchaser shall proceed
diligently to defend such Seller Action with the assistance of legal
counsel reasonably satisfactory to the Seller, provided, however, that the
Purchaser shall not settle, adjust or compromise such Seller Action, or admit
any liability with respect to such Seller Action, without the prior written
consent of the Seller, such consent not to be unreasonably withheld or
delayed. In any event, the Purchaser shall use

 


 

 

 

 

 

 

 

54  

 

 

 

 

 


 

its reasonable best efforts to have its counsel keep the Seller apprised of
material developments and, to the extent requested by Seller, to consult and
reasonably cooperate with any counsel of Seller.

 

 

(e) Following the Closing, the Purchaser shall use its reasonable best
efforts to cause the Company to retain all records reasonably necessary to
defend the Seller Actions.

 

 

(f) In the event of any good faith dispute as to whether any matter is a
Seller Action, Seller may, but shall not be obligated to,
commence investigation, prosecution, management, conduct, appeal or defense
of such matter pending resolution of such dispute. In the event that
the Seller so commences and it is determined that such matter is not a
Seller Action, the Seller shall have the right to cease the investigation,
prosecution, management, conduct, appeal or defense of such matter and the
Seller and Purchaser shall cooperate to transfer the control thereof to
the Purchaser or the Company, as applicable. In such event, the Purchaser or
the Company, as applicable, shall promptly reimburse the Seller for
all reasonable out-of-pocket costs, fees and other expenses incurred to
such date in connection with the investigation, prosecution, management,
conduct, appeal or defense of such matter.

 

 

(g) The Purchaser shall, and shall cause the Company to, cooperate with the
Seller (if so requested by the Seller) with respect to any Seller Action for
which the Seller will be defending, in having the Seller (or one of its
Affiliates) substituted as the named party, the costs of obtaining such
substitution to be borne by the Seller. Absent a substitution, the Company
shall cooperate and assist as is reasonably needed (to the extent requested)
in satisfying any procedural requirements in connection with any such Seller
Action which is being defended by the Seller, including by filing papers on
the Seller\'s behalf.

 

 

(h) None of the Purchaser, the Company or their respective Subsidiaries
shall intentionally take any action or omit to take any action for the
purpose of interfering with or adversely affecting the rights and powers
of the Seller pursuant to this Section 11.05.

or obligations hereunder may be assigned or delegated by such party without
the prior written consent of the other parties, and any attempted assignment
or delegation of this Agreement or any of such rights or obligations by any

release the assignor from its obligations hereunder.

 

 

Section 12.05 Specific Performance. The parties hereto agree that
irreparable damage would occur in the event that any of the provisions of

Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions hereof in any
court of the United States or any state having jurisdiction, this being in

AND CONSTRUED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE LAWS OF THE STATE OF DELAWARE, WITHOUT

shall not be superseded and shall remain in full force and effect in
accordance with its terms. This Agreement may be executed by facsimile and
in counterparts, each of which shall be deemed to

 


 

 

 

 

 

 

 

56  

 

 

 

 

 


 

be an original and shall be binding on the party who executed the same, but
all of which together shall constitute one and the same instrument.

 

 

Section 12.08 Severability. If any provision of this Agreement shall be held
to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable, the validity, legality and
enforceability of the remaining provisions shall not in any way be affected
or impaired thereby. If for any reason any term or provision containing
a restriction set forth herein is held to cover an area or to be for a length
of time which is unreasonable, or in any other way is construed to be too
broad or to any extent invalid, such term or provision shall not
be determined to be null, void and of no effect, but to the extent the same
is or would be valid or enforceable under applicable law, any court of
competent jurisdiction shall construe and interpret or reform this Agreement
to provide for a restriction having the maximum enforceable area, time period
and other provisions (not greater than those contained herein) as shall be
valid and enforceable under applicable laws.

 

 

Section 12.09 Waiver. At any time prior to the Closing, the parties
hereto may (i) extend the time for the performance of any of the obligations
or other acts of the other parties hereto, (ii) waive any inaccuracies in

set forth in a written instrument signed on behalf of such party. Except as
otherwise expressly provided herein, no failure on the part of any party to
exercise, and no delay in exercising, any right, power or remedy hereunder,
or otherwise available in respect hereof at law or in equity, shall operate
as a waiver thereof, nor shall any single or partial exercise of such right,
power or remedy by such party preclude any other or further exercise thereof,
or the exercise of any other right, power or remedy.

 

 

Section 12.10 Survival. All of the representations and warranties contained
in this Agreement or in any certificate delivered pursuant to this Agreement
shall survive beyond the Closing. Notwithstanding the preceding sentence,

warranty of the other party contained herein later than eighteen months after

5.19 shall survive until six months after the statute of limitations with
respect to the matters addressed therein has expired (including all waivers
or extensions thereof), the representations in Sections 4.01, 4.02, 4.03,
5.01, 5.02, 5.03 and 5.06 shall survive indefinitely; and provided that any
claims made or asserted by a party within the applicable time period
prescribed above shall survive such expiration until such claim is finally
resolved and all obligations with respect thereto are fully satisfied. All
statements contained in any certificate delivered by or on behalf of any
party hereto in connection with this Agreement or the consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereunder shall constitute and have the same force
and effect as the representations and warranties of such party as set forth
herein as if it had been incorporated into this Agreement as a
representation, warranty and agreement by such party. Each covenant and
agreement herein shall survive until the date that is one year after the last
date that a Person is required to take any action or refrain from taking any
action under such section.

the matter disclosed and its relationship to the particular provision of this
Agreement corresponding to such other section of the letter is reasonably

press release or make any such public statement prior to such consultation,
except as may be required by applicable law, regulation, court order or by

securities exchange. The Seller and the Purchaser shall use reasonable
efforts to agree on the description of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement contained in the initial press releases to be issued by the parties

PURCHASER GUARANTEE

 

 

THIS GUARANTEE (this "Guarantee") is made and given as of April 1st, 2008 by
Centrica plc, a public limited company organized under the laws of England
and Wales ("Guarantor"), in favor of Custom Energy Holdings, L.L.C., a
Delaware limited liability company ("Seller").

 

 

R E C I T A L S

 

 

A. Pursuant to the Purchase Agreement (the "Purchase Agreement"), dated as of
April 1st, 2008, by and among the Seller, Great Plains Energy Incorporated
(solely for the purposes set forth therein) and Direct Energy Services, LLC
(the "Purchaser"), the Seller has agreed to sell the Seller's ownership of
one hundred percent (100%) of the membership interests in Strategic Energy,
L.L.C., a Delaware limited liability company (the "Company"), to the
Purchaser.

 

 

B. The Guarantor owns, indirectly, 100% of the membership interests of
the Purchaser.

 

 

C. In order to induce the Seller to enter into the Purchase Agreement, the
Guarantor has agreed to guarantee the Purchaser's obligations under the
Purchase Agreement, as more fully set forth below.

 

 

D. Capitalized terms used herein and not otherwise defined shall have the
meanings ascribed to such terms in the Purchase Agreement.

 

 

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing and for other good and
valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which consideration is
hereby acknowledged, the Guarantor does hereby covenant and agree with the
Seller for the benefit of the Seller as follows:

 

 

1. Guarantee of Obligations. To induce the Purchaser to enter into the Purchase Agreement, the Guarantor (as primary obligor and not as surety only) irrevocably, absolutely and unconditionally:

 

 

(a) guarantees to the Seller, on the terms and subject to the conditions of
this Guarantee, the prompt performance of all obligations of the Purchaser
under the Purchase Agreement, including all sums and liabilities which now
are or at any other time shall be due, owing or incurred by the Purchaser to
the Seller in respect of the Purchaser\'s obligations under the Purchase
Agreement (collectively, the "Purchaser's Guaranteed Obligations") strictly
in accordance with their terms and regardless of any Requirements of Law
affecting any such terms or the rights of the Seller with respect thereto;
and

 

 

(b) undertakes that if any amount guaranteed by this Guarantee is not
recoverable on the basis of a guarantee for any reason it will (as a separate
and independent stipulation) pay the Seller on demand whatever amount or
amounts shall equal what it would

 


 

 

 

 

 

 

 

65  

 

 

 

 

 


 

have been liable to pay but for such irrecoverability and shall indemnify the
Seller against all Losses suffered or incurred by the Seller in connection
with such irrecoverability.

 

 

2. Nature of Guarantee.

 

 

(a) The Guarantor hereby waives any requirement that the Seller exhaust any
right or take any action against, or provide any notice to, the Purchaser or
any other person or entity before proceeding hereunder.

 

 

(b) This is a continuing guarantee and the Guarantor's undertakings under
this Guarantee shall remain in full force and effect until final performance
in full of its obligations under this Guarantee notwithstanding any
intermediate payment or performance or the invalidity or unenforceability in
whole or in part of any of the Purchaser's Guaranteed Obligations or any
other event.

 

 

(c) This Guarantee is in addition to and is not in any way prejudiced by any
other security now or in the future held by or on behalf of the Seller.

 

 

(d) The Guarantor shall not by virtue of any payment or performance by it
under the terms of this Guarantee (except to the extent such rights would
have been available to the Purchaser had it paid or performed directly):

 

 

(i) be subrogated to any rights, security or monies held, received or
receivable by the Seller or be entitled to assert against any Person owing
any obligation to the Seller in connection with the Purchase Agreement any
right of contribution or indemnity in respect of any payment made or monies
received on account of the Guarantor's liability under this Guarantee; or

 

 

(ii) receive, claim or have the benefit of any payment, distribution or
security from or on account of any Person owing any obligation to the Seller
in connection with the Purchase Agreement, or exercise any right of set-off
against such Person, and the Guarantor shall hold in trust for, and
immediately on demand pay or transfer to, the Seller any payment or
distribution or benefit of security received by it contrary to this
Guarantee.

 

 

3. Discharge of Guarantee.

 

 

(a) This Guarantee and any undertakings contained herein shall be discharged
by the full performance by the Guarantor of its obligations under this
Guarantee, but otherwise shall not be discharged or affected by any act,
omission, matter or thing that, but for this provision, might operate to
release or otherwise exonerate the Guarantor from those obligations in whole
or in part including:

 


 

 

 

 

 

 

 

66  

 

 

 

 

 


 

(i) the granting of time, or any waiver or other indulgence (including any
extension, renewal, acceptance, forbearance or release in respect of any of
the Purchaser's Guaranteed Obligations);

 

 

(ii) the taking, variation, compromise, renewal or release of or refusal or
neglect to perform or enforce any rights, remedies or securities against the
Purchaser or any other Person;

 

 

(iii) any modification, variation or addition to the terms of any of the
Purchaser's Guaranteed Obligations or of any other document or security;

 

 

(iv) any irregularity, defect or informality in the terms of any of the
Purchaser's Guaranteed Obligations or any other document or security or any
legal limitation, disability, incapacity or want of authority of any Person;

 

 

(v) any transfer or assignment of any rights or obligations by any party,
whether or not they relate to the Purchaser's Guaranteed Obligations;

 

 

(vi) any corporate reorganization, reconstruction, amalgamation,
dissolution, liquidation, merger, acquisition of or by or other alteration in
the corporate existence or structure of any party, or the non-existence of
the Purchaser; or

 

 

(vii) any composition or similar arrangement by any party or any
other Person.

 

 

(b) Where any discharge (whether in respect of any of the Purchaser's
Guaranteed Obligations or otherwise) is made in whole or in part or any
arrangement is made on the faith of any payment, security or other
disposition which is avoided or must be restored for any reason, the
liability of the Guarantor under this Agreement shall continue as if the
discharge or arrangement had not been made.

 

 

4. Representations, Warranties and Covenants of Guarantor. The Guarantor hereby represents and warrants to the Seller, that, as of the date hereof and at all times during the effectiveness of this Guarantee:

 

 

(a) The Guarantor is a public limited company organized under the laws of
England and Wales and possesses the capacity to sue and be sued in its own
name and has the power to carry on its business and to own its property and
other assets.

under this Guarantee and to carry out the transactions contemplated hereby,
and all necessary corporate, shareholder and other action will have been

67  

 

 

 

 

 


 

(c) The obligations of the Guarantor under this Guarantee constitute its
legal, valid and binding obligations and are in full force and effect in
accordance with their terms.

 

 

(d) The execution, delivery and performance by the Guarantor of this

any court or Governmental Body having jurisdiction over the Guarantor; (y)
conflict with, or result in any breach of any of the terms of, or constitute
a default under, any agreement or other instrument to which the Guarantor is
a party or any license or other authorization to which the Guarantor is
subject or by which the Guarantor or any of its property is bound; or (z)
contravene or conflict with the provisions of the Guarantor's organizational
documents.

 

 

5. Registered Agent. The Guarantor has appointed CT Corporation System (and any successor thereto) as its registered agent for service of process on such Person in the State of Delaware. The Purchaser will not change such appointment while this Guarantee is in effect without the consent of the Seller.

 

 

6. Amendments; Waivers. Neither this Guarantee nor any provision hereof may be amended, modified, waived, discharged (except by performance of the Purchaser's Guaranteed Obligations) or terminated except by an instrument in writing duly signed by or on behalf of the Seller and the Guarantor. No failure or delay on the part of the Seller in exercising any right, power or remedy may be, or may be deemed to be, a waiver thereof; nor may any single or partial exercise of any right, power or remedy preclude any other or further exercise thereof or exercise of any other right, power or remedy hereunder.

 

 

7. Notices.
