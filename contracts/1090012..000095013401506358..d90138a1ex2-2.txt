         in the making of the Offer, the term "Devon" as used herein shall
         include such subsidiary, other than in Article 5 where the term "Devon"
         shall not include such subsidiary, but Devon shall continue to be
         liable to Anderson, as principal obligor, for such subsidiary's
         obligations hereunder and for any default by such subsidiary in the
         performance of its obligations hereunder.

(c)      The Offer shall expire at the Initial Expiry Time, except that the
         Offer may be extended, at the sole discretion of Devon, if the
         conditions thereto set forth in Schedule A hereto are not satisfied on
         the date and time at which the Offer expires and if Devon determines,
         acting reasonably, that there is a reasonable prospect that the
         conditions of the Offer may not be satisfied prior to the Expiry Time.
         In addition, in the event that any appropriate regulatory approval is
         not obtained prior to the time the Offer is scheduled to terminate,
         unless such approval has been denied, Devon agrees that it will extend
         the Offer for a period of not less than 10 days past the Initial Expiry
         Time pending receipt of such approval, provided that Devon shall not be
         required to extend the Offer past December 31, 2001 or such later date
         as may be mutually agreed in writing by Anderson and Devon.

         Subject to the satisfaction or waiver of the conditions set forth in
         Schedule A hereto, Devon shall within three days accept for payment and
         pay for all Anderson Shares validly tendered (and not properly
         withdrawn) pursuant to the Offer. Each of Devon and Anderson shall use
         all commercially reasonable efforts to consummate the Offer, subject to
         the terms and conditions thereof.

(d)      It is agreed that Devon may, in its sole discretion, waive any term or
         condition of the Offer for its benefit provided that if Devon takes up
         and pays for any Anderson Shares it shall acquire not less than the
         Minimum Required Shares. Devon agrees that it shall not amend any term
         or condition of



<PAGE>   11
                                       7



         the Offer (which for greater certainty, does not include waiving, in
         whole or part, a condition of the Offer) in a manner that is materially
         adverse to the holders of Anderson Shares without the prior written
         consent of Anderson other than to: (i) comply with Section 2.1(c); (ii)
         extend the Offer, if, at the initial or extended date on which the
         Offer is scheduled to terminate, any of the conditions to the Offer
         shall not be satisfied or waived by Devon, until such time as such
         conditions are satisfied or waived by Devon; (iii) extend the Offer for
         any period required by any rule, regulation, interpretation or position
         of the Securities Authorities applicable to the Offer or any period
         required by applicable law; or (iv) comply with the legal obligations
         of Devon with respect to any amendment, modification or change of the
         Offer.

         Notwithstanding and without limiting the foregoing, Devon may at any
         time following the Initial Expiry Time, reduce the Minimum Condition to
         a percentage greater than 50% and shall, subject to the conditions of
         the Offer being satisfied or waived, take up and pay for all Anderson
         Shares validly deposited to the Offer, provided that, after Devon
         reduces the Minimum Condition, Devon extends the Offer by a 10 day
         period and agrees to extend the Offer for not less than two additional
         successive 10 day periods if, upon the expiry of any extension, the
         Minimum Condition has not been satisfied. Any agreement of Devon
         referred to in the foregoing sentence shall continue after the
         Effective Time until such agreement shall have been performed or this
         Agreement is terminated.

         Devon shall provide a draft of any proposed amendment, modification or
change to the Offer to Anderson.

(e)      Devon will instruct the depositary under the Offer to advise Anderson
         from time to time, not less frequently than every five Business Days
         until the day immediately prior to the Expiry Time and thereafter on an
         hourly basis, if requested by Anderson and in such manner as Anderson
         may reasonably request, as to the number of Anderson Shares that have
         been tendered (and not withdrawn) under the Offer.

(f)      Devon's obligation to make the Offer as set forth in Section 2.1(a) is
         conditional upon the execution and delivery to Devon, concurrently with
         the execution of this Agreement, of a pre-tender agreement in the form
         or substantially in the form of the agreement attached hereto as
         Schedule B by each of the Chief Executive Officer, Chief Operating
         Officer and Chief Financial Officer of Anderson. Anderson will use its
         reasonable commercial efforts to cause each of the directors and
         officers of Anderson (other than the Chief Executive Officer, Chief
         Financial Officer and Chief Operating Officer of Anderson) to execute
         and deliver to Devon, as soon as reasonably practical, a pre-tender
         agreement in the form or substantially in the form of the agreement
         attached hereto as Schedule B. The directors' circular shall reflect
         the execution and delivery by the Chief Executive Officer, Chief
         Financial Officer, Chief Operating Officer of Anderson and, to the
         extent applicable, the other directors and officers of Anderson the
         pre-tender agreements referred to in this Section 2.1(f).

(g)      Notwithstanding any of the other terms of this Agreement, Devon shall
         not be required to make the Offer if, on or before the date Devon would
         otherwise be required to make the Offer under the terms of this
         Agreement:

         (i)      any of the representations or warranties of Anderson contained
                  herein shall not be true and correct in all material respects
                  or Anderson shall not have complied in all material respects
                  with each of its covenants set out herein; or



<PAGE>   12
                                       8



         (ii)     the Board of Directors of Anderson shall have withdrawn its
                  positive recommendation of the Offer; or

         (iii)    a Material Adverse Change shall have occurred, or a person
                  shall have commenced or threatened to bring a bona fide action
                  for injunctive relief against the performance of this
                  Agreement or the completion of the Offer, or another event
                  shall have occurred or circumstances shall exist which would
                  make it impossible or impractical to satisfy one or more of
                  the conditions of the Offer set forth in Schedule A hereto.

         The foregoing conditions are for the sole benefit of Devon and may be
waived by Devon at any time.

2.2 ANDERSON DIRECTORS' CIRCULAR

(a)      Anderson hereby consents to the Offer as set forth in Section 2.1 and
         confirms that its Board of Directors has unanimously approved the Offer
         and this Agreement, has determined that the Offer is fair, from a
         financial point of view, to the holders of Anderson Shares and has
         resolved to unanimously recommend acceptance of the Offer by the
         holders of Anderson Shares, subject to Section 8.3. Anderson shall
         prepare and make available for mailing with the Offer, in both the
         English and French languages, sufficient copies of a directors'
         circular prepared in accordance with Securities Laws. The directors'
         circular will set forth (among other things) the recommendation of the
         Board of Directors of Anderson as described above. Anderson shall
         provide Devon with a draft copy of the directors' circular prior to its
         finalization for Devon's review and comment.

(b)      Anderson represents that the Board of Directors of Anderson has been
         advised that the directors of Anderson intend to tender all their
         Anderson Shares under the Offer.

(c)      Anderson represents that it has obtained advice from BMO Nesbitt Burns
         Inc. that the consideration to be offered to Anderson's shareholders
         pursuant to the Offer is fair to holders of Anderson Shares from a
         financial point of view and that such financial advisor will provide an
         opinion to such effect on or before September 7, 2001. The fairness
         opinion will be attached to or referred to in the directors' circular
         referred to in Section 2.2(a).

2.3 OFFER DOCUMENTS

(a)      Devon shall file or cause to be filed with the appropriate Securities
         Authorities an Offer to Purchase and Take-over Bid Circular and the
         related Letter of Transmittal and Notice of Guaranteed Delivery
         pursuant to which the Offer will be made (collectively, the "Offer
         Documents"). The Offer Documents, when filed with the Securities
         Authorities and when mailed to holders of Anderson Shares, shall
         contain (or shall be amended in a timely manner to contain) all
         information which is required to be included therein in accordance with
         the Act and any applicable Canadian provincial securities laws, United
         States securities laws, the "blue sky" or securities laws of the states
         of the United States and any other applicable law (collectively, the
         "Securities Laws").

(b)      Anderson agrees to provide such assistance as Devon or its agents may
         reasonably request in connection with communicating the Offer and any
         amendments and supplements thereto to the holders of the Anderson
         Shares and to such other persons as are entitled to receive the Offer
         under Securities Laws, including providing lists and updated or
         supplemental lists of the shareholders of Anderson and of the holders
         of Anderson Options and other securities convertible into or
         exchangeable for Anderson Shares and mailing labels with respect to all
         such holders of securities



<PAGE>   13
                                       9



         as soon as possible after the date of this Agreement but in any event
         no later than the close of business in Calgary on September 6, 2001 and
         updates or supplements thereto from time to time as may be requested by
         Devon.

2.4 OUTSTANDING STOCK OPTIONS

(a)      Subject to the receipt of any necessary regulatory approvals, persons
         holding options pursuant to the Stock Option Plan who may do so under
         Securities Laws and in accordance with the Stock Option Plan shall be
         entitled to exercise all of their options and tender all Anderson
         Shares issued in connection therewith under the Offer. The Anderson
         Board of Directors shall not, prior to completion of the Offer, grant
         additional options pursuant to the Stock Option Plan. It is agreed by
         Devon that all Anderson Options which have been tendered to Anderson
         for exercise, conditional on Devon taking up Anderson Shares under the
         Offer ("Conditional Option Exercise"), shall be deemed to have been
         exercised concurrently with the take-up of Anderson Shares by Devon.
         Furthermore, Devon shall accept as validly tendered under the Offer as
         of the Take-up Date all Anderson Shares which are to be issued pursuant
         to the Conditional Option Exercise, provided that the holders of such
         options indicate that such shares are tendered pursuant to the Offer
         and provided that such holder agrees to surrender their remaining
         unexercised options to Anderson for cancellation for no consideration
         effective immediately after the Take-up Date.

(b)      Anderson and Devon agree that to the extent holders of Anderson Options
         do not exercise such Anderson Options and tender the Anderson Shares
         they receive upon such exercise, Anderson may agree with all remaining
         holders of Anderson Options that, in lieu of such persons exercising
         their Anderson Options, Anderson will pay to such persons the
         difference between the exercise price of their Anderson Options and the
         purchase price for the Anderson Shares under the Offer immediately
         after the Expiry Time of the Offer in exchange for the termination of
         their Anderson Options and provided that such holders agree to
         surrender their remaining unexercised options to Anderson for
         cancellation for no consideration effective immediately after the
         Take-up Date.

(c)      Devon and Anderson acknowledge and agree that, pursuant to the Stock
         Option Plan, all outstanding and unvested Anderson Options shall
         immediately vest at the Effective Time.

2.5 RIGHTS PLAN

(a)      Anderson represents to Devon that its Board of Directors has
         irrevocably resolved to waive the application of the Rights Plan to the
         Offer immediately prior to the Expiry Time and to any other actions
         taken by Devon in furtherance of acquiring all of the Anderson Shares
         and covenants to Devon to take all action necessary pursuant to the
         Rights Plan to effect such waiver no earlier than the Expiry Time, and
         to ensure that the Separation Time (as defined in the Rights Plan) does
         not occur.

(b)      Anderson covenants and agrees with Devon and represents to Devon that
         its Board of Directors has resolved not to waive the application of the
         Rights Plan or to redeem any of the outstanding Rights or take any
         other action which would limit the application of the Rights Plan to
         any transaction other than a Take-over Proposal that expires no sooner
         than the Initial Expiry Time.

2.6 EMPLOYEE OBLIGATIONS AND OTHER EMPLOYMENT OBLIGATIONS

(a)      Devon shall honor or cause Anderson to honor all Employee Obligations
         and all other employment obligations referred to in this Section 2.6.
         Devon acknowledges that Anderson shall hold the benefits of this
         Section 2.6 in trust for the benefit of the officers and employees of
         Anderson.

(b)      Anderson shall terminate the Anderson Employee Profit Sharing Plan
         subject to and coincident with the take-up of Anderson Shares by Devon
         under the Offer on the Take-up Date and shall make whatever
         arrangements may be necessary to permit the participants in such plan
         to tender the Anderson Shares to be allocated to them on termination of
         such plan under the Offer.

(c)      Subject to and following the take-up of Anderson Shares by Devon under
         the Offer on the Take-up Date, Devon covenants and agrees that,
         effective upon the termination of the Anderson Employee Profit Sharing
         Plan pursuant to Section 2.6(b) and up to and including the date (the
         "Rollover Date") which is the earlier of (i) the date that such
         participant is covered under Devon's employee profit sharing plan and
         (ii) December 31, 2001, Devon shall cause Anderson to make all
         necessary arrangements so that all participants in such plan prior to
         the Take-up Date shall continue to have the same payroll amounts
         withheld by Anderson. On the Rollover Date, Devon shall cause Anderson
         to pay all such accumulated contributions to such participants together
         with an amount equal to (i) in the case of participants who continue to
         be employed by Anderson on the Rollover Date, the actual contributions
         made by such participants up to and including the Rollover Date and
         (ii) in the case of participants who are terminated on or prior to the
         Rollover Date, the maximum amount such participants could have
         contributed under the Anderson Employee Profit Sharing Plan up to and
         including the Rollover Date had they not been terminated, provided,
         however, where a participant has been terminated for just cause,
         Anderson shall only be required to pay an amount equal to such
         participant's actual contributions.

(d)      On or prior to the earlier of: (i) the take-up of Anderson Shares by
         Devon under the Offer on the Take-up Date; and (ii) December 15, 2001,
         Anderson shall have the right to allocate and pay out to employees of
         Anderson bonus amounts in the aggregate amount of up to $9 million
         constituting the bonus amounts determined by Anderson to have been
         earned prior to such date by such employees under Anderson's customary
         year end bonus practices as in effect at the date of this Agreement
         (the "Anderson Year End Bonus Arrangements").

(e)      Anderson shall terminate the Anderson Share Appreciation Rights Plan
         subject to and coincident with the take-up of Anderson Shares by Devon
         under the Offer on the Take-up Date and Anderson shall make whatever
         arrangements may be necessary to permit the participants in such plan
         to exercise all of their "Rights" (as defined in the Anderson Share
         Appreciation Rights Plan) and to receive an appreciation amount for
         each such "Right" on the Take-up Date. For purposes of the foregoing
         and notwithstanding the definition of "Appreciation Amount" contained
         in the Anderson Share Appreciation Rights Plan, the appreciation amount
         in respect of each "Right" so exercised shall be equal to the
         difference obtained by subtracting the Base Value of the "Right" (as
         determined in accordance with the terms of the Anderson Share
         Appreciation Rights Plan) from the greater of: (i) the closing price
         for the Anderson Shares on The Toronto Stock Exchange as determined in
         accordance with the terms of the Anderson Share Appreciation Rights
         Plan; and (ii) the consideration offered by Devon for Anderson Shares
         under the Offer.

(f)      On or prior to the take-up of Anderson Shares by Devon under the Offer
         on the Take-up Date, Anderson shall have the right to pay to those
         individuals listed in Schedule E hereto the amounts listed therein
         which have been determined by Anderson to be due and owing to such
         individuals in



<PAGE>   15
                                       11



         lieu of stock options promised and not delivered to such individuals in
         connection with employment offers.

(g)      Subject to and following the take-up of Anderson Shares by Devon under
         the Offer on the Take-up Date, Devon covenants and agrees to cause
         Anderson to continue to apply Anderson's customary practices related to
         the payment of accrued vacation pay on termination of employment as in
         effect at the date of this Agreement.

(h)      Subject to and following the take-up of Anderson Shares by Devon under
         the Offer on the Take-up Date, Devon covenants and agrees to cause
         Anderson to apply Anderson's current practices related to severance and
         termination payments payable to its employees as described in Schedule
         F hereto until at least December 31, 2001.

(i)      Devon acknowledges that Anderson has granted deferred bonuses to
         eligible employees of Anderson pursuant to the Anderson Deferred Bonus
         Plan in an aggregate amount of not more than $700,000, 50% of which is
         payable on the first anniversary date of the award with the balance
         payable on the second anniversary date. Devon further acknowledges that
         in order to be entitled to receive payment under such plan, an employee
         must be employed at the time of payment except that an employee
         terminated without cause is entitled to be paid all deferred bonus
         amounts on the date of termination. Subject to and following the
         take-up of Anderson Shares by Devon under the Offer on the Take-up
         Date, Devon covenants and agrees to cause Anderson to pay the
         aforementioned deferred bonuses in accordance with the foregoing terms.

(j)      Subject to and following the take-up of Anderson Shares by Devon under
         the Offer on the Take-up Date, Devon covenants and agrees to:

         (i)      cause Anderson to continue the Anderson Group RRSP Plan until
                  at least December 31, 2001; and

         (ii)     cause Anderson to pay to employees terminated for any reason
                  except just cause all amounts accrued in connection with such
                  plan to the date of termination of employment.

                           PUBLICITY AND SOLICITATION

3.1 PUBLICITY

(a)      Each of Devon and Anderson shall advise, consult and cooperate with the

         directors, officers, employees or agents to issue any press release or
         other written statement to the press with respect to this Agreement or
         the transactions contemplated hereby. Devon and Anderson shall not
         issue any such press release or make any such public statement prior to
         such consultation, except as may be required by applicable law or by
         obligations pursuant to any listing agreement with a stock exchange and
         only after using its best efforts to consult the other party taking
         into account the time constraints to which it is subject as a result of
         such law or obligation.

(b)      Anderson and Devon agree that a joint press release substantially in
         the form of Schedule C shall be issued immediately following the

                 TRANSACTIONS FOLLOWING COMPLETION OF THE OFFER

4.1 SECOND STAGE TRANSACTION

                  If Devon takes up and pays for Anderson Shares pursuant to the
terms of the Offer, and thereby acquires at least the Minimum Required Shares,
Devon agrees to use all commercially reasonable efforts to acquire, and Anderson
agrees to use all commercially reasonable efforts to assist Devon in acquiring,
the balance of the Anderson Shares by way of a statutory arrangement,
amalgamation, merger, reorganization, consolidation, recapitalization or other
type of acquisition transaction or transactions ("Second Stage Transaction")
carried out for consideration per Anderson Share not less than the consideration
paid pursuant to the Offer (it being understood that Devon shall be under no
obligation to pay more than that amount). Nothing herein shall be construed to
prevent Devon from acquiring, directly or indirectly, additional Anderson Shares
in the open market or in privately negotiated transactions, in another take-over
bid, tender or exchange offer, or otherwise in accordance with Securities Laws
(including by way of compulsory acquisition) following completion of the Offer.

4.2 INFORMATION CIRCULAR, ETC.

                  Without limiting Section 4.1, Anderson agrees that if Devon is
required to effect a Second Stage Transaction which requires approval of
Anderson's shareholders in a meeting of Anderson's shareholders, Anderson shall
take all action necessary in accordance with Securities Laws, other applicable
Canadian laws, the Anderson Governing Documents and the requirements of The
Toronto Stock Exchange, the New York Stock Exchange or any other regulatory
authority having jurisdiction to duly call, give notice of, convene and hold a
meeting of its shareholders as promptly as practicable to consider and vote upon
the action proposed by Devon. In the event of such a meeting or meetings,
Anderson shall use all commercially reasonable efforts to mail to its
shareholders an Information Circular with respect to the meeting of Anderson's
shareholders. The term "Information Circular" shall mean such proxy or other
required informational statement or circular, as the case may be, and all
related materials at the time required to be mailed to Anderson's shareholders
and all amendments or supplements thereto, if any. Devon and Anderson each shall
use all commercially reasonable efforts to obtain and furnish the information
required to be included in any Information Circular. The information provided
and to be provided by Devon and Anderson for use in the Information Circular, on
both the date the Information Circular is first mailed to Anderson's
shareholders and on the date any such meeting is held, shall not contain any
untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact required to
be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein, in light of the
circumstances under which they are made, not misleading and will comply in all
material respects with all applicable requirements of law. Devon and Anderson
each agree to correct promptly any such information provided by it for use in
any Information Circular which shall have become false or misleading.

         representation) will not contain any untrue statement of a material

7.2 PROVISION OF INFORMATION

(a)      Immediately upon acceptance of this Agreement, Anderson shall provide

         confidentiality restrictions pursuant to the Confidentiality Agreement,
         to enable Devon to quickly and efficiently integrate the business and

         permit:

         (i)      Devon and its representatives to have reasonable access to
                  Anderson's premises, field operations, records, computer

                  of Anderson to ensure there is compliance with Section 7.1

It is acknowledged that the purpose of this clause is to permit Devon to be in a
position to expeditiously integrate the business and operations of Anderson with
that of Devon immediately upon but not prior to, the Effective Time without
causing any unreasonable disruptions to Anderson's business or operations prior
to the Effective Time.

                              COVENANTS OF ANDERSON

8.1 NOTICE OF MATERIAL CHANGE

                  From the date hereof until the termination of this Agreement,
Anderson shall promptly notify Devon in writing of:

(a)      any material change (actual, anticipated, contemplated or, to the
         knowledge of Anderson, threatened, financial or otherwise) in the
         business, affairs, operations, assets, liabilities (contingent or
         otherwise) or capital of Anderson and its subsidiaries considered as a
         whole;

(b)      any change in any representation or warranty set forth in Article 6
         which change is or may be of such a nature as to render any such
         representation or warranty misleading or untrue in a material respect;
         or

(c)      any material fact in respect of Anderson which arises and which would
         have been required to be stated herein had the fact arisen on or prior
         to the date of this Agreement.

                  Anderson shall in good faith discuss with Devon any change in
circumstances (actual, anticipated, contemplated or, to the knowledge of
Anderson, threatened, financial or otherwise) which is of such a nature that
there may be a reasonable question as to whether notice need to be given to
Devon pursuant to this section.

8.2 NON-COMPLETION FEE

                  If at any time after the execution of this Agreement (and
provided there is no material breach or non-performance by Devon of a material
provision of this Agreement in any respect):

(a)      the Board of Directors of Anderson has withdrawn or, in any manner
         adverse to Devon, redefined, modified or changed any of its
         recommendations or determinations referred to in Section 2.2, or shall
         have resolved to do so;

(b)      any bona fide Take-over Proposal for the Anderson Shares is publicly
         announced or commenced, and the Board of Directors of Anderson shall
         have failed to publicly reaffirm and maintain its recommendation of the
         Offer to Anderson's shareholders within 10 days after the public
         announcement or commencement of any such Take-over Proposal;

(c)      the Board of Directors of Anderson shall have recommended that
         Anderson's shareholders deposit their Anderson Shares under, vote in
         favour of, or otherwise accept, a Take-over Proposal;



<PAGE>   28
                                       24



(d)      Anderson shall have entered into any agreement with any person with
         respect to a Take-over Proposal prior to the Expiry Time of the Offer,
         excluding a confidentiality agreement entered into in compliance with
         Section 8.3; or

(e)      a Take-over Proposal is publicly announced, proposed, offered or made
         to Anderson's shareholders or to Anderson prior to the Expiry Time of
         the Offer and such Take-over Proposal has been completed,

                  Anderson shall upon the occurrence of any such event and in
any event within one Business Day pay to Devon the amount of $210 million. Such
payment shall be made in immediately available funds to an account designated by
Devon. On the date of the earliest of any of the events specified in Sections
8.2(a) to (e), Anderson shall be deemed to hold such amount in trust for Devon.
In the event that a Take-over Proposal is publicly announced, proposed, offered
or made to holders of Anderson Shares as contemplated by Section 8.2(e),
Anderson agrees to deliver to Devon, at least 3 Business Days prior to the
scheduled expiry of such Take-over Proposal, an irrevocable letter of credit, in
form satisfactory to Devon, acting reasonably, drawable within one Business Day
after Devon shall have delivered to the issuing party a written certificate
confirming the occurrence of an event specified in Section 8.2(e) or such other
form of security as is satisfactory to Devon, acting reasonably.

                  Any payment pursuant to Section 8.2 shall be without prejudice
to the rights or remedies available to Devon upon the breach of any provision of
this Agreement provided that Anderson shall only be obligated to only one
payment pursuant to this Section 8.2.

8.3 NO SOLICITATION

                  Anderson shall immediately cease and cause to be terminated
any existing solicitation, initiation, encouragement, activity, discussion or
negotiation with any parties conducted heretofore by Anderson, any of its
subsidiaries or their officers, directors, employees, financial advisors,
representatives and agents ("Representatives") with respect to a Take-over
Proposal (as defined herein) whether or not initiated by Anderson and in
connection therewith, Anderson shall not release any third party from any
confidentiality or standstill agreement to which Anderson and such third party
is a party or amend any of the foregoing and shall exercise all rights to
require the return of information regarding Anderson. From and after the date
hereof, Anderson and its subsidiaries will not, and will not authorize or permit
any of their Representatives to, directly or indirectly, solicit, initiate or
encourage (including by way of furnishing information) or participate in or take
any other action to facilitate any inquiries or the making of any proposal which
constitutes or may reasonably be expected to lead to a Take-over Proposal from
any person, or engage in any discussion, negotiations or inquiries relating
thereto or accept any Take-over Proposal; provided, however, that Anderson may:
(i) engage in discussions or negotiations with a third party who (without any
solicitation, initiation or encouragement, directly or indirectly, by Anderson,
any of its subsidiaries or the Representatives after the date hereof) seeks to
initiate such discussions or negotiations and may furnish such third party
information concerning Anderson and its business, properties and assets which
has previously been provided to Devon if, and only to the extent that: (A) the
third party has first made a bona fide written Take-over Proposal that is
financially superior to the Offer and has demonstrated that such proposal
constitutes a commercially feasible transaction which could be carried out
within a time frame that is reasonable in the circumstances and that the funds
or other consideration necessary for the Take-over Proposal are available or
reasonably likely to be available (as determined in good faith in each case by
Anderson's Board of Directors after receiving the advice of its financial
advisors) (a "Superior Proposal") and Anderson's Board of Directors has
concluded in good faith, after considering applicable law and receiving the
advice of outside counsel that such action is required by the Anderson Board of
Directors to comply with fiduciary duties under applicable law; (B) prior to
furnishing



<PAGE>   29
                                       25



such information to or entering into discussions or negotiations with such
person or entity, Anderson provides immediate notice orally and in writing to
Devon specifying the identity of such person or entity and that it is furnishing
information to or entering into discussions or negotiations with such person or
entity in respect to a Superior Proposal, receives from such person or entity an
executed confidentiality agreement having confidentiality and standstill terms
substantially similar to those contained in the Confidentiality Agreement
executed by Devon, and immediately provides Devon with a complete copy of such
Superior Proposal and any amendments thereto and confirming in writing the
determination of Anderson's board that the Take-over Proposal if completed would
constitute a Superior Proposal; (C) Anderson provides immediate notice to Devon
at such time as it or such person or entity terminates any such discussions or
negotiations; and (D) Anderson immediately provides to Devon any information
provided to any such person or entity whether or not previously made available
to Devon; (ii) comply with applicable Securities Laws relating to the provision
of directors' circulars, and make appropriate disclosure with respect thereto to
Anderson's shareholders; and (iii) accept, recommend, approve or implement a
Superior Proposal from a third party, but only (in the case of this clause
(iii)) if prior to such acceptance, recommendation, approval or implementation,
Anderson's Board of Directors shall have concluded in good faith, after
considering provisions of applicable law and after giving effect to all
proposals to adjust the terms and conditions of this Agreement and the Offer
which may be offered by Devon during the 2 Business Days notice period set forth
below and after receiving the advice of outside counsel, that such action is
required by the Anderson Board of Directors to comply with fiduciary duties
under applicable law and Anderson terminates this Agreement in accordance with
Sections 8.2 and 11.1(f) and concurrently therewith has paid the fees payable
thereunder. Anderson shall give Devon orally and in writing at least 2 Business
Days advance notice of any decision by the Board of Anderson to accept,
recommend, approve or implement a Superior Proposal which notice shall identify
the party making the Superior Proposal and shall provide a true and complete
copy thereof and any amendments thereto. In addition Anderson shall, and shall
cause its respective financial and legal advisors to, negotiate in good faith
with Devon to make such adjustments in the terms and conditions of this
Agreement and the Offer as would enable Anderson to proceed with the Offer as
amended rather than the Superior Proposal. In the event Devon proposes to amend
this Agreement and the Offer to provide substantially equivalent or superior
value to that provided under the Superior Proposal within the 2 Business Day
time period specified above, then Anderson shall not enter into any agreement
regarding the Superior Proposal.

8.4 ANDERSON BOARD OF DIRECTORS

                  The Board of Directors of Anderson immediately following the
acquisition by Devon of more than 50% of the outstanding Anderson Shares
pursuant to the Offer shall be reconstituted through resignations of all
existing Anderson directors and the appointment of Devon nominees in their
stead. Anderson shall, in accordance with the foregoing and subject to the
provisions of the Act, assist Devon to secure the resignations of all Anderson
directors to be effective at such time as may be required by Devon and to use
its best efforts to cause the election of the Devon nominees to fill the
vacancies so created in order to effect the foregoing without the necessity of a
shareholder meeting.

8.5 STRUCTURE OF TRANSACTION

                  Anderson shall, to the extent reasonable, cooperate with Devon
in structuring the acquisition by Devon of Anderson in a tax efficient manner,
including without limitation, by completing to the satisfaction of Devon, acting
reasonably, a possible internal corporate reorganization of Anderson involving
the transfer of certain assets to one or more partnerships and/or the transfer
of certain assets or unincorporated business divisions to separate wholly-owned
Canadian subsidiary corporations.

proxy statement of Devon and any registration statement filed by Devon with the
United States Securities and Exchange Commission, and amendments thereto, as
required under applicable law. Such financial statements shall be prepared in

the use of, reconciliations of such financial statements to generally accepted
accounting principles in the United States, prepared in accordance with Item 18
of Form 20-F under the United States Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as
amended. If required by applicable law, such financial statements shall be
audited by Anderson's auditors. Anderson shall request that its auditors, to the
extent required under applicable law, provide their consent to the use of their
report and the use of their name in connection with any disclosure by Devon of
such financial statements. Devon agrees to reimburse Anderson for its reasonable
third party expenses in connection with complying with this Section 8.6.

11.1 TERMINATION

                  This Agreement, other than the provisions set forth in
Sections 8.2, 11.2 and 12.6, may be terminated by written notice promptly given
to the other party hereto, at any time prior to the time Devon first takes up
and pays for Anderson Shares:

(a)      by mutual agreement by Devon and Anderson; or

(b)      by Anderson, if Devon has not mailed the Offer Documents to holders of
         Anderson Shares on or before 12:00 midnight (Calgary time) on September
         12, 2001; or

                                       28



(d)      by either Devon or Anderson, if Devon has not taken up and paid for the
         Anderson Shares deposited under the Offer on or before the date which
         is 90 days, or if a Take-over Proposal is publicly announced, proposed,
         offered or made to Anderson's shareholders, 180 days, following the day
         of mailing of the Offer Documents; or

(e)      by either Devon or Anderson, if the Offer terminates or expires at the
         Expiry Time without Devon taking up and paying for any of the Anderson
         Shares as a result of the failure of any condition to the Offer to be
         satisfied or waived unless the failure of such condition shall be due
         to the failure of the party seeking to terminate this Agreement to
         perform the obligations required to be performed by it under this
         Agreement; or

(f)      by either Devon or Anderson, if the fee referred to in Section 8.2
         becomes payable and payment is made or is immediately available to
         Devon; or

(g)      by either Devon or Anderson, if there has been a misrepresentation,
         breach or nonperformance by the other party of any representation,
         warranty or covenant contained in this Agreement which would have or
         would be reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on the
         party seeking to terminate, provided the breaching party has been given
         notice of and 3 Business Days to cure any such misrepresentation,
         breach or non-performance.

11.2 EFFECT OF TERMINATION

                  In the event of the termination of this Agreement as provided
in Section 11.1, this Agreement shall forthwith have no further force or effect
and there shall be no obligation on the part of Devon or Anderson hereunder
except as set forth in Sections 8.2 (provided that the right of payment (in the
case of Section 8.2(e), being the public announcement or commencement of such
Take-over Proposal) arose prior to the termination of this Agreement), 8.6
(insofar as it relates to the reimbursement of expenses) and 12.6 and this
Section 11.2, which provisions shall survive the termination of this Agreement.
Nothing herein shall relieve any party from liability for any breach of this
Agreement.

11.3 AMENDMENT

                  This Agreement may be amended by mutual agreement between the
parties hereto. This Agreement may not be amended except by an instrument in
writing signed by the appropriate officers on behalf of each of the parties

12.2 MISCELLANEOUS

                  This Agreement: (i) except for the Confidentiality Agreement,
constitutes the entire agreement and supersedes all other prior agreements and
understandings, both written and oral, between the parties, with respect to the
subject matter hereof; and (ii) shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit
of the parties hereto and their respective successors and assigns. The parties
hereto shall be entitled to rely upon delivery of an executed facsimile copy of
the Agreement, and such facsimile copy shall be legally



<PAGE>   34
                                       30



effective to create a valid and binding agreement among the parties hereto. The
parties hereto agree that irreparable damage would occur in the event that any
of the provisions of this Agreement were not performed in accordance with their
specific terms or were otherwise breached. It is accordingly agreed that the
parties shall be entitled to an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of
this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions hereof in
any court of the Province of Alberta having jurisdiction, this being in addition
to any other remedy to which they are entitled at law or in equity.

12.3 DIRECTORS' AND OFFICERS' INSURANCE

                  Devon agrees that, if it acquires the Minimum Required Shares
under the Offer, it shall cause Anderson or any successor of Anderson to
maintain Anderson's current director and officer liability insurance coverage,
or obtain "run on" director and officer liability insurance or coverage under
Devon's director and officer liability insurance policy (all on terms not less
favourable than those under Anderson's current director and officer liability
insurance coverage) for the current and former directors and officers of
Anderson and its subsidiaries covering claims made prior to or within 6 years
following the Effective Time. Devon's obligation hereunder shall be limited to
purchasing such insurance as is available at a cost of not more than 250% of the
current annual premiums for director and officer liability insurance paid by
Anderson.

12.4 INDEMNITIES

                  Devon agrees that, if it acquires the Minimum Required Shares
under the Offer, it shall cause each of Anderson and its subsidiaries to fulfill
its obligations pursuant to indemnities provided or available to past and
present officers and directors of Anderson and its subsidiaries pursuant to the
provisions of the articles, bylaws or similar constating documents of Anderson
and its subsidiaries, applicable corporate legislation and any written indemnity
agreements between any of Anderson or its subsidiaries and its past and present
directors and officers in the forms provided to Devon; provided that this
Section 12.4 shall not restrict or prohibit Devon from dissolving Anderson,
reorganizing the capital of Anderson, amalgamating Anderson with one or more
corporations, transferring all or substantially all of the assets of Anderson to
another entity, causing Anderson to assume the liabilities of another entity or
otherwise reorganizing or restructuring Anderson or its business (a
"Reorganization"). Devon covenants that it shall, upon such Reorganization,
cause any successor of Anderson to assume Anderson's obligations under such
indemnities. Devon further covenants that it shall ensure that Anderson and any
successor of Anderson shall have the necessary financial resources (whether
through its net assets or otherwise) to satisfy aggregate indemnification
liability of $250 million. In the event that Anderson or any successor of
Anderson is required to make any payment under such indemnities, the $250
million referred to in the preceding sentence shall be reduced by the amount so
paid provided that the foregoing shall not affect the obligations of Anderson or
such successor under such indemnities.

12.5 ASSIGNMENT

                  Except as expressly permitted by the terms hereof, neither
this Agreement nor any of the rights, interests or obligations hereunder shall
be assigned by any of the parties hereto without the prior written consent of
the other parties. Devon may assign all or any part of its rights or obligations
under this Agreement to a direct or indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of Devon,
provided that if such assignment takes place, Devon shall continue to be liable
to Anderson for any default in performance by the assignee.

expenses incurred in connection with this Agreement and the transactions
contemplated hereby shall be paid by the party incurring such cost or expense,
whether or not the Offer is consummated.

12.7 CONFIDENTIALITY AGREEMENT

                  With respect to the Offer, including market purchases
permitted under Applicable Law, Anderson hereby consents to the Offer and Devon
is hereby released from any of the restrictions set forth in Section 9 of the
Confidentiality Agreement. The parties further agree that this Agreement
constitutes a "Definitive Agreement" as that term is defined in the
Confidentiality Agreement.

12.8 SURVIVAL OF REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES

                  The representations and warranties of Devon and Anderson
contained in this Agreement shall not survive the completion of the Offer and
shall expire and be terminated at the earlier of the Effective Time and the date
on which this Agreement is terminated in accordance with its terms.

12.9 SEVERABILITY

                  Whenever possible, each provision of this Agreement shall be
interpreted in such manner as to be effective and valid under applicable law.
Any provision of this Agreement that is invalid or unenforceable in any
jurisdiction shall be ineffective to the extent of such invalidity or
unenforceability without invalidating or rendering unenforceable the remaining
provisions hereof, and any such invalidity or unenforceability in any
jurisdiction shall not invalidate or render unenforceable such provision in any
other jurisdiction.

                           indirectly, a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Offeror
                           or affecting an amalgamation or merger of Anderson's

(d)      there shall not exist any prohibition at law against the Offeror making
         the Offer or taking up and paying for all of the Anderson Shares under

         respect, any of its covenants or other obligations under the Agreement,

         misrepresentation, breach or non-performance and has failed to cure any
         such misrepresentation, breach or non-performance;

(f)      Devon shall have determined in its reasonable judgment that there does
         not exist and has not occurred any Material Adverse Change; and

(g)      the Offeror shall have determined in its sole judgment that, on terms
         satisfactory to the Offeror that: (i) the Board of Directors of
         Anderson shall not have waived the application of the Rights Plan to
         the purchase of securities by any third party prior to the Expiry Date
         of the Offer (ii) a cease trading order or an injunction shall not have
         been issued that has the effect of prohibiting or preventing the
         exercise of the Rights or the issue of common shares of Anderson upon
         the exercise of the Rights in relation to any offer that expires prior
         to the Expiry Date and such cease trading order or injunction shall be
         in full force and effect; (iii) a court of competent jurisdiction shall
         not have ordered that the Rights are illegal, of no force or effect or
         may not be exercised in relation to any offer which expires prior to
         the Expiry Date; (iv) the Rights and the Rights Plan shall not
         otherwise have been held unexercisable or unenforceable in relation to
         any offer which expires prior to the Expiry Date; or (v) the Rights
         Plan does not makes it inadvisable for the Offeror to proceed with the
         Offer and/or with taking up and paying for all of the Anderson Shares
         under the Offer, a compulsory acquisition and any Second Stage
         Transaction.

                          FORM OF PRE-TENDER AGREEMENT

                                 August 31, 2001

Dear Sir:

RE: OFFER BY DEVON TO PURCHASE ALL OF THE ANDERSON SHARES

         Reference is made to the Pre-Acquisition Agreement dated August 31,
2001 (the "Pre-Acquisition Agreement") between Devon and Anderson pursuant to
which Devon has agreed to make an offer to purchase all of the issued and
outstanding Anderson Shares. Unless otherwise defined herein, all capitalized
terms referred to herein shall have the meanings attributed thereto in the
Pre-Acquisition Agreement.

         We understand that you (the "Selling Shareholder") or your affiliates
beneficially own, directly or indirectly, or exercise control or direction over,
the number of Anderson Shares set forth in your acceptance at the end of this
letter agreement.

         Any references in this letter agreement to Anderson Shares owned by the
Selling Shareholder shall mean such number of Anderson Shares and, where the
context requires, shall include all Anderson Shares issued to the Selling
Shareholder after the date hereof pursuant to the exercise of Anderson Options.

         This letter agreement sets out the terms and conditions upon which the
Selling Shareholder has agreed, among other things, to support the Offer and to
deposit under the Offer, or cause to be deposited under the Offer, all of the
Anderson Shares (including Anderson Shares issuable upon the exercise of
Anderson Options) held by the Selling Shareholder that are, or will be,
beneficially owned or controlled by the Selling Shareholder.

1. COVENANTS OF SELLING SHAREHOLDER

         By the acceptance of this letter agreement, the Selling Shareholder
hereby agrees, subject to the terms of paragraph 3 of this letter agreement,
from the date hereof until the earlier of the termination of this letter
agreement and the Expiry Time:

(a)      not to sell, assign, convey or otherwise dispose of any of the Anderson
         Shares owned by such Selling Shareholder and not to permit any
         affiliate of such Selling Shareholder to sell, assign, convey or
         otherwise dispose of any of the Anderson Shares owned by it;

(b)      unconditionally and irrevocably to accept and to cause any affiliate of
         such Selling Shareholder to unconditionally and irrevocably accept the
         Offer made by Devon by depositing the Anderson Shares presently owned
         or hereafter acquired (including any Anderson Shares hereafter acquired
         pursuant to the exercise of any options to purchase Anderson Shares) by
         such Selling Shareholder or affiliate prior to the Expiry Time and in
         accordance with the terms and conditions of the Offer;

(c)      to sell or surrender for cancellation to Anderson pursuant to Section
         2.4(b) or exercise all options held by the Selling Shareholder to
         acquire Anderson Shares (the "Options") to deposit or cause to be
         deposited any Anderson Shares hereafter acquired by the Selling
         Shareholder pursuant



<PAGE>   40
                                       2


         to the exercise of Options, and to forthwith surrender all remaining
         Options to Anderson for no additional consideration immediately
         following the Effective Time;

(d)      not to exercise any statutory or other rights of withdrawal with
         respect to any Anderson Shares owned by such Selling Shareholder or any
         affiliate of such Selling Shareholder once deposited pursuant to the
