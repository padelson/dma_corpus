Business Day (excluding Friday as a Business Day for this purpose) following
the satisfaction or, to the extent permitted by applicable Law, waiver of the

deliver to the Registrar of Companies of the State of Israel (the " _Companies
Registrar_ ") a notice of the contemplated Merger and the proposed date of the

Closing Date. The Merger shall become effective upon the issuance by the

_Effective Time_ ").

 



 

Section 1.4 _Effects of the Merger_. The Merger shall have the effects set
forth in this Agreement and in the relevant provisions of the ICL. Without
limiting the generality of the foregoing, and subject thereto, at the

Merger Sub shall be merged with and into the Company, the separate corporate
existence of Merger Sub shall cease and the Company shall continue as the
Surviving Company, (b) all the properties, rights, privileges, powers and
franchises of the Company and Merger Sub shall vest in the Surviving Company,
(c) all debts, liabilities and duties of the Company and Merger Sub shall
become the debts, liabilities and duties of the Surviving Company, (d) all the
rights, privileges, immunities, powers and franchises of the Company (as the

the ICL, (e) the Companies Registrar shall transfer the Registries of Liens
(as such term is defined in Section 181 of the Companies Ordinance, 5743-1983
of the State of Israel) of the Company and Merger Sub to the Registry of Liens
of the Surviving Company, and (f) the Surviving Company shall be regarded as
the Company or Merger Sub in any legal proceeding to which the Company or
Merger Sub are a party.

 



 

Section 1.5 _Articles of Association of the Company_. At the Effective Time,
the articles of association of the Company, as in effect immediately prior to
the Effective Time, shall be the articles of association of the Surviving
Company, until duly amended as provided therein and by applicable Law.

 



 

Section 1.6 _Directors_. The parties shall take all actions necessary so that
the directors of Merger Sub at the Effective Time shall, from and after the
Effective Time, be appointed and serve as the directors of the Surviving
Company until the earlier of their resignation or removal or until their
respective successors are duly elected and qualified, as the case may be, in
accordance with the Surviving Companys articles of association.

 



 

Section 1.7 _Officers_. At the Effective Time, the officers of Merger Sub
immediately before the Effective Time shall be the officers of the Surviving
Company, until the earlier of their resignation or removal or until their

 **ARTICLE II** ** 
EFFECT ON THE SHARE CAPITAL OF THE CONSTITUENT CORPORATIONS; EXCHANGE OF
CERTIFICATES**

 



 

Section 2.1 _Conversion of Share Capital_. At the Effective Time, by virtue of
the Merger and without any action on the part of the Company, Parent, Merger
Sub or the holders of any share capital or equity interests of the Company,
Parent or Merger Sub:

 



 

(a) Each ordinary share, par value one Israel Agora (NIS 0.01) per share, of
the Company (such shares, collectively, the " _Shares_ ") issued and
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than any Excluded
Shares) shall thereupon be converted

 



      
 

 



 

automatically into and shall thereafter represent the right to receive: (i)
$4.46 in cash, subject to reduction of any Tax required to be withheld under
applicable Tax Law, without interest (such consideration, as it may from time
to time be amended in accordance with this Agreement, the " _Cash
Consideration_ "), plus (ii) one contractual contingent value right (each, a "
_CVR_ "), which shall represent the right to receive a contingent payment in
cash upon the achievement of a specific milestone, at the time and subject to
the terms and conditions of the CVR Agreement, subject to reduction of any Tax
required to be withheld under applicable Tax Law, without interest (the " _CVR
Consideration_ " and together with the Cash Consideration, " _Merger
Consideration_ "), upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in
this Agreement. As of the Effective Time, without any further action by any
Person, all Shares shall be owned by Parent free and clear of any Liens and
shall be registered as such in Parents name in the shareholders registry of
the Surviving Company.

 



 

(b) Each Share held in the treasury of the Company or owned by Parent or any
direct or indirect wholly-owned Subsidiary of the Company or of Parent
immediately prior to the Effective Time, if any (collectively, " _Excluded
Shares_ "), shall automatically be cancelled and shall cease to exist, and no
consideration shall be delivered in exchange therefor.

 



 

(c) Each ordinary share, par value one Israel Agora (NIS 0.01) per share, of
Merger Sub issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time
shall be automatically and without further action cancelled and shall cease to
exist, and no cash or other consideration shall be delivered in exchange
therefor.

 



 

(d) If at any time during the period between the date of this Agreement and
the Effective Time, any change in the outstanding ordinary shares of the
Company, or securities convertible into or exchangeable into or exercisable
for ordinary shares of the Company, shall occur as a result of any
reclassification, recapitalization, share split (including a reverse share
split) or subdivision or combination, exchange or readjustment of shares, or
any share dividend or share distribution with a record date during such period
(excluding, in each case, normal quarterly cash dividends), merger or other
similar transaction, the Merger Consideration shall be equitably adjusted so
as to provide Parent and the holder of Shares the same economic effect as
contemplated by this Agreement prior to such event; _provided_ , that nothing
in this _Section 2.1(d)_ shall be construed to permit the Company to take any
action with respect to its securities that is prohibited by the terms of this
Agreement.

 



 

(e) From and after the Effective Time, each holder of a Certificate or
Uncertificated Shares theretofore representing any Shares shall cease to have
any rights with respect thereto, except the right to receive the Merger
Consideration payable therefor upon the surrender thereof in accordance with
the provisions of _Section 2.3_. The Merger Consideration paid in accordance
with the terms of this _Article II_ shall be deemed to have been paid in full
satisfaction of all rights existing prior to the Effective Time pertaining to
such Shares.

 



      
 

 



 

Section 2.2 _Treatment of Options, Restricted Share Units and Warrants_.

 



 

(a) _Treatment of Company Options and Restricted Share Units_.

 



 

(i) At the Effective Time, each option (each, a " _Company Option_ ") to
purchase Shares granted under the Amended and Restated 2009 Stock Plan, the
2013 Stock Incentive Subplan and any other share option, share purchase or
equity compensation plan, arrangement or agreement of the Company (the "
_Company Share Plans_ ") that is then outstanding and unexercised, whether or
not vested, and which has an exercise price per Share that is less than the
Cash Consideration (each, an " _In the Money Option_ "), shall be cancelled
and converted into the right to receive (A) an amount in cash equal to (1) the
excess, if any, of (x) the Cash Consideration over (y) the exercise price
payable per Share under such Company Option, multiplied by (2) the total
number of Shares subject to such In the Money Option immediately prior to the
Effective Time (without regard to vesting) and (B) a number of CVRs equal to
the total number of Shares subject to such In the Money Option immediately
prior to the Effective Time (without regard to vesting).

 



 

(ii) At the Effective Time, each Company Option other than an In the Money
Option that is then outstanding and unexercised, whether or not vested (each,
an " _Out of the Money Option_ "), shall be cancelled and converted into the
right to receive a cash payment from Parent with respect to each Share subject
to the Out of the Money Option upon the Milestone Payment Date, if any, equal
to the amount by which the sum of (A) the Cash Consideration and (B) the
amount per CVR in cash to be paid at the Milestone Payment Date under the CVR
Agreement exceeds the exercise price payable per Share under such Out of the
Money Option (to the extent such sum exceeds such exercise price, such Out of
the Money Option shall be referred to as a " _Positive Option_ "). Promptly
following the Effective Time, Parent shall cause the Company to acknowledge
the foregoing obligations in writing to each holder of Positive Options.
Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, any Out of the Money Options
with an exercise price payable per Share equal to or greater than $7.09 shall
be cancelled at the Effective Time without any consideration payable therefor.

 



 

(iii) Notwithstanding anything in _Section 2.2(a)(i)_ to the contrary, if (X)
pursuant to the terms of the CVR Agreement, the Milestone Payment Date occurs
following the fifth anniversary of the change in ownership or effective
control of the Company for the purposes of Treas. Reg. Section 1.409A-3(i)(5)
and (Y) receipt of a payment by the holder of a CVR granted pursuant to
_Section 2.2(a)(i)_ (a " _Section 2.2(a)(i) Option Holder_") after such
fifth anniversary will result in the Section 2.2(a)(i) Option Holder being
subject to taxation under Section 409A of the Code with respect to the cash
payment made to such Section 2.2(a)(i) Option Holder pursuant to _Section
2.2(a)(i)(A)_ above (a " _Post 5th Anniversary Payment_ "), (I) the Post 5th
Anniversary Payment shall not be paid to the Section 2.2(a)(i) Option Holder
and (II) the Post 5th Anniversary Payment shall be reallocated pro rata to
holders of CVRs other than Section 2.2(a)(i) Option Holders in a manner that
will not result in taxation under Section 409A of the Code with respect to the
cash payments made pursuant to _Section 2.2(a)(i)(A)_.

 



 

(iv) At the Effective Time, each restricted share unit (each, a " _Restricted
Share Unit_ ") granted under the Company Share Plans that is then outstanding,
whether or not vested, shall be cancelled and converted into the right to
receive (A) an amount in cash equal to (1) the Cash Consideration, multiplied
by (2) the total number of Shares subject to such Restricted Share Unit
(without regard to vesting) and (B) a number of CVRs equal to the total number
of Shares subject to such Restricted Share Unit (without regard to vesting).

 



      
 

 



 

(v) As soon as reasonably practicable after the Effective Time (but no later
than the second payroll date after the Effective Time) and as soon as
practicable following the Milestone Payment Date, if any, Parent shall cause
the Surviving Company or its Affiliate to, and the Surviving Company or its
Affiliate, as applicable, shall, pay the portion of the aggregate
consideration payable as of such date pursuant to _Section 2.2(a)(i)(A)_ with
respect to In the Money Options, including any consideration payable pursuant
to CVRs, _Section 2.2(a)(ii)_ with respect to Out of the Money Options, and
_Section 2.2(a)(iv)_ with respect to Restricted Share Units, in all cases,
net of any Tax required to be withheld under applicable Tax Law withholdings,
through, to the extent applicable, the Surviving Companys or its Affiliates
payroll (subject to any Tax required to be withheld under applicable Tax Law)
to the holders of Restricted Share Units and to the holders of Company Options
(or in the case of any payments pursuant to _Section 2.2(a)(i), Section
2.2(a)(ii) or Section 2.2(a)(iv)_ which are subject to Tax pursuant to
Sections 102(b)(2) and 102(b)(3) of the Ordinance (together the " _102 Company
Options_ "), payment shall be made through the trustee appointed by the
Company to serve as trustee of the Company Share Plans and the awards granted
thereunder pursuant to Section 102 of the Ordinance (the " _102 Trustee_ ")
subject to the provisions of Section 102 of the Ordinance and any Tax ruling
received from the ITA regarding such 102 Company Options including the Option
Tax Ruling); _provided_ , _however_ , that to the extent there is not a Tax
withholding obligation with respect to a Company Option or a Restricted Share
Unit, the consideration payable pursuant to _Section 2.2(a)(i)_ or _Section
2.2(a)(iv)_, as applicable, payable with respect to such Company Options shall
be paid in the manner described in _Section 2.3_ through the Payment Fund
rather than this _Section 2.2(a)(v)_.

 



 

(vi) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall deliver all required
notices (which notices shall be subject to Parents reasonable approval) to
each holder of Company Options or Restricted Share Units setting forth each
holders rights pursuant to the respective Company Share Plan, stating that
such Company Options or Restricted Share Units shall be treated in the manner
set forth in this _Section 2.2(a)_.

 



 

(vii) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall take all actions
(including obtaining any necessary determinations and/or resolutions of the
Company Board of Directors or a committee thereof) that it determines to be
appropriate or necessary to (A) immediately prior to the Effective Time,
accelerate the vesting and exercisability of each unexpired and unexercised
Company Option then outstanding so that each such Company Option shall be
fully vested and exercisable prior to the Effective Time, (B) immediately
prior to the Effective Time, accelerate the vesting of each Restricted Share
Unit then outstanding so that each such Restricted Share Unit shall be fully
vested prior to the Effective Time, (C) ensure that each of the Company Share
Plans shall terminate and all rights under any provision of any other employee
incentive or benefit plan, program or arrangement or any non-employee director
plan maintained by the Company providing for the issuance or grant of any
other interest in respect of the share capital of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries shall be cancelled, (D) cause, as of the Effective Time, each
Restricted Share Unit and each unexpired and unexercised Company Option then
outstanding as of immediately prior to the Effective Time, whether vested or
unvested (and each plan, if any, under which any Company Option may be granted
except, with respect to any such plan, as otherwise agreed by Parent) to be
cancelled, terminated and extinguished, subject to the rights to payment
pursuant to this _Section 2.2(a)_ and (E) ensure that no holder of a Company
Option, Restricted Share Unit or any participant in any Company

 



      
 

 



 

Share Plan or any other arrangements maintained by the Company shall have any
rights to acquire, or other rights in respect of, the share capital of the
Company, the Surviving Company or any of their Subsidiaries, except the right
to receive the payment contemplated by this _Section 2.2(a)_ in cancellation
and settlement thereof.

 



 

(b) _Treatment of Company Warrants_. At the Effective Time, and subject to
_Section 2.4_, each outstanding, unexpired and unexercised warrant to
purchase Shares (each, as amended prior to the date hereof and in relation to
the Merger, a " _Company Warrant_ "), whether or not then vested, shall be
cancelled and converted into the right to receive an amount in cash equal to
(i) the Specified Corporate Reorganization Warrant Consideration (as defined
in the applicable Company Warrant), multiplied by (2) the total number of
Shares subject to such Company Warrant immediately prior to the Effective
Time.

 



 

Section 2.3 _Exchange and Payment_.

 



 

(a) Prior to the Effective Time (but in no event later than three Business
Days prior to the Closing Date), Parent shall select a U.S. bank or trust
company reasonably acceptable to the Company (which may use a local Israeli
sub-paying agent) to act as the paying agent for the Merger (the " _Paying
Agent_ ") and, in connection therewith, shall enter into an agreement with the
Paying Agent in form reasonably satisfactory to the Company and Parent.

 



 

(b) Immediately after the Effective Time, Parent shall deposit (or cause to be
deposited) with the Paying Agent, for payment to the holders of Shares (other
than the Excluded Shares) pursuant to the provisions of this _Article II_, an
amount of cash sufficient to pay the aggregate Cash Consideration in
accordance with _Section 2.1(a)_ and _Section 2.2 _(such cash amount being
referred to herein as the " _Payment Fund_ ") (it being understood and agreed,
for the avoidance of doubt, that Parent shall not be required to deposit any
funds related to any CVR with the Rights Agent unless and until such deposit
is required pursuant to the terms of the CVR Agreement). Except as otherwise
provided in this Agreement, the Payment Fund shall not be used for any purpose
other than to fund payments due pursuant to this _Article II_.

 



 

(c) Promptly following the Effective Time, Parent and the Surviving Company
shall cause the Paying Agent to mail to each holder of record (as of
immediately prior to the Effective Time) of (i) a certificate or certificates
(the " _Certificates_ ") that immediately prior to the Effective Time
represented outstanding Shares or (ii) uncertificated Shares (the "
_Uncertificated Shares_ "), in each case, whose shares were converted into the
right to receive the Merger Consideration, (A) a form of letter of transmittal
(which shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and
title to the Certificates held by such Person shall pass, only upon proper
delivery of the Certificates to the Paying Agent, and which letter shall be in
customary form and contain such other provisions as Parent or the Paying Agent
may reasonably specify), (B) an appropriate declaration and/or Valid Tax
Certificate in which the beneficial owner of Shares provides certain
information necessary for Parent to reasonably determine whether any Tax
amounts need to be withheld from the Merger Consideration payable to such
beneficial owner pursuant to the terms of the Ordinance (in each case, subject
to the provisions of _Section 2.3_, _Section 2.4_ and _Section 5.17_), the
Code or any provision of state, local, Israeli or foreign Tax law, and (C)
instructions (including instructions from the Paying Agent) for use in
effecting the surrender of the Certificates and Uncertificated Shares in
exchange for the Merger

 



      
 

 



 

Consideration. Upon surrender of a Certificate (or affidavit of loss in lieu
thereof) for cancellation to the Paying Agent, together with such letter of
transmittal, duly completed and validly executed in accordance with the
instructions thereto, and such other documents as the Paying Agent or Parent
may reasonably require (including the declaration and/or Valid Tax
Certificate), the holder of such Certificate shall be entitled to receive in
exchange for the Shares formerly represented by such Certificate (other than
Excluded Shares) the Merger Consideration for each such Share (subject to
deduction of Tax required to be withheld under applicable Tax Law), and the
Certificate so surrendered shall forthwith be cancelled. In the case of a
book-entry transfer of Uncertificated Shares (other than Excluded Shares),
upon receipt of such letter of transmittal duly completed and validly executed
in accordance with the instructions thereto, and such other documents as the
Paying Agent or Parent may reasonably require (including the declaration
and/or Valid Tax Certificate), the holders of such Uncertificated Shares shall
be entitled to receive in exchange therefor the Merger Consideration for each
such Share (subject to deduction of any Tax required to be withheld under
applicable Tax Law), and the transferred Uncertificated Shares so surrendered
shall forthwith be canceled. The Paying Agent shall accept such Certificates
and transferred Uncertificated Shares upon compliance with such reasonable
terms and conditions as the Paying Agent may reasonably impose to effect an
orderly exchange thereof in accordance with normal exchange practices. No
interest shall be paid or accrued for the benefit of holders of the
Certificates and Uncertificated Shares on the Merger Consideration payable
upon the surrender of such Certificates and Uncertificated Shares pursuant to
this _Section 2.3(c)_. Payments and deliveries to be made under this
Agreement shall be made in U.S. dollars by check or wire transfer of
immediately available funds to such address or bank accounts as shall be set
forth in the letter of transmittal. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
in this _Section 2.3(c)_, any Merger Consideration received by the Paying
Agent in consideration for Shares issued as a result of the exercise or
vesting (as applicable) of 102 Company Options which are held by the 102
Trustee and are subject to Tax pursuant to Section 102(b)(2) and 102(b)(3) of
the Ordinance (the " _102 Shares_ "), shall be transferred to the 102 Trustee
subject to the provisions of Section 102 of the Ordinance and any Tax ruling
received from the Israeli Tax Authority (the " _ITA_ ") regarding such 102
Company Options including the Option Tax Ruling.

 



 

(d) Payment of the Merger Consideration is to be made to the Person in whose
name the surrendered Certificate or Uncertificated Share is registered
(subject to reduction for any Tax required to be withheld under applicable Tax
Law).

 



 

(e) Until surrendered as contemplated by this _Section 2.3_, each Certificate
or Uncertificated Share shall be deemed after the Effective Time to represent
only the right to receive the Merger Consideration payable in respect thereof
pursuant to this _Article II_, without any interest thereon.

 



 

(f) All cash paid upon the surrender for exchange of Certificates or
Uncertificated Shares in accordance with the terms of this _Article II_ shall
be deemed to have been paid in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to
the Shares formerly represented by such Certificates or Uncertificated Shares.
At the Effective Time, the shareholders registry of the Company shall be
closed and there shall be no further registration of transfers of the Shares
that were outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time. If, after the
Effective Time, Certificates are presented to the Surviving Company or the
Paying Agent for transfer or transfer

 



      
 

 



 

is sought for Uncertificated Shares, such Certificates or Uncertificated
Shares shall be cancelled and exchanged as provided in this _Article II_.

 



 

(g) The Paying Agent shall invest any cash included in the Payment Fund as
directed by Parent, on a daily basis. Any interest or other income resulting
from such investments shall be paid to Parent, upon demand.

 



 

(h) Any portion of the Payment Fund (and any interest or other income earned
thereon) that remains undistributed to the holders of Certificates or
Uncertificated Shares six months after the Effective Time shall be delivered
to the Surviving Company, upon demand, and any remaining holders of
Certificates or Uncertificated Shares (except to the extent representing
Excluded Shares) shall thereafter look only to the Surviving Company as
general creditors thereof for payment of the Merger Consideration (subject to
abandoned property, escheat or other similar laws), without interest.

 



 

(i) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement, none
of Parent, the Surviving Company, the Paying Agent or any other Person shall
be liable to any Person in respect of any portion of the Payment Fund properly
delivered to a public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property,
escheat or similar Law. If any Certificates or Uncertificated Shares shall not
have been exchanged prior to two (2) years after the Effective Time (or
immediately prior to such earlier date on which the related Merger
Consideration would otherwise escheat to or become the property of any
Governmental Entity), any such Merger Consideration in respect thereof shall,
to the extent permitted by applicable Law, become the property of the
Surviving Company, free and clear of all claims or interest of any Person
previously entitled thereto.

 



 

(j) If any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the
making of an affidavit, in form and substance reasonably acceptable to Parent,
of that fact by the Person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or
destroyed and, if required by Parent or the Paying Agent, the posting by such
Person of a bond in such amount as Parent or the Paying Agent may determine is
reasonably necessary as indemnity against any claim that may be made against
it, any of its Affiliates or the Surviving Company with respect to such
Certificate, the Paying Agent will deliver in exchange for such lost, stolen
or destroyed Certificate the Merger Consideration payable in respect thereof
pursuant to this Agreement.

 



 

Section 2.4 _Withholding Rights_.

 



 

(a) Parent, Parents Subsidiaries (including Merger Sub), the Surviving
Company, the Company, the Companys Subsidiaries, the Paying Agent, the 102
Trustee, the Rights Agent and anyone acting on their behalf shall each be
entitled to deduct and withhold, or cause to be deducted and withheld, from
any consideration payable or other payment (in each case, whether in cash or
in kind) made pursuant to this Agreement to any person who or that is either a
shareholder of the Company or holds Company Options, Restricted Share Units or
Company Warrants (a " _Holder_ ") or to any other Person such amounts as are
required to be deducted and withheld under the Withholding Tax Ruling, a Valid
Tax Certificate, the Interim Option Tax Ruling and the Option Tax Ruling, if
obtained, or under any other provision of applicable Tax Law (including, for
the avoidance of doubt, the Ordinance and the Internal

 



      
 

 



 

Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the " _Code_ ")) as reasonably determined by
Parent. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the preceding sentence and
subject to any other provision to the contrary in the Withholding Tax Ruling
with respect to any consideration payable (whether in cash or in kind)
pursuant to this Agreement to any Holder (other than any holder of Company
Options, Restricted Share Units or 102 Shares) such consideration shall be
retained by Parent, the Paying Agent or the Rights Agent (as the case may be)
for the benefit of each such payment recipient for a period of up to 180 days
from the applicable payment date or an earlier date required in writing by
such payment recipient or by the ITA (the " _Withholding Drop Date_ ") (during
which time no payor shall make any payments to any payment recipient and
withhold any amounts for Israeli Taxes from such payments deliverable pursuant
to this Agreement, except as provided below and during which time each such
payment recipient may obtain a Valid Tax Certificate). If a payment recipient
delivers, no later than three Business Days prior to the Withholding Drop Date
a Valid Tax Certificate to a payor, then the deduction and withholding of any
Israeli Taxes shall be made only in accordance with the provisions of such
Valid Tax Certificate and the balance of the payment that is not withheld
shall be paid to such payment recipient. If any payment recipient (i) does not
provide the payor with a Valid Tax Certificate by no later than three Business
Days before the Withholding Drop Date, or (ii) submits a written request with
the payor to release his portion of the payment prior to the Withholding Drop
Date and fails to submit a Valid Tax Certificate at or before such time, then
the amount to be withheld from such payment recipient shall be calculated
according to the applicable withholding rate as prescribed under applicable
Tax Law, which amount shall be increased by the interest plus linkage
differences as defined in Section 159A of the Ordinance for the time period
between the fifteenth (15th) calendar day of the month following the month
during which the Closing occurs and the time the relevant payment is made.
Subject to any other provision in the Withholding Tax Ruling or any other
written instructions by the ITA, in the absence of a Valid Tax Certificate
which also covers the Holders portion of the CVR Consideration, the
applicable amount to be withheld from such Holder from any amount payable to
the Holder on the Closing Date will be calculated (as provided above) also on
such Holders portion of the CVR Consideration, and will be deducted, and
delivered to the ITA as provided above.

 



 

(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, and unless otherwise
determined in the Withholding Tax Ruling, the Option Tax Ruling, the Interim
Option Tax ruling or any Valid Tax Certificate, any payments made to holders
of Company Options, Restricted Share Units and 102 Shares will be subject to
deduction or withholding of Israeli Tax under the Ordinance on the fifteenth
(15th) day of the calendar month following the month during which the Closing
occurs, unless prior to such date (i) with respect to 102 Company Options, the
Company Options subject to Tax pursuant to section 3(i) of the Ordinance and
102 Shares, the Option Tax Ruling (or the Interim Option Tax Ruling) shall
have been obtained providing for no withholding, (ii) with respect to non-
Israeli resident holders of Company Options or Restricted Share Units, who
were granted their awards in consideration solely for work or services
performed outside of Israel for the Companys non-Israeli resident
subsidiaries, a validly executed declaration in the form attached hereto as
Schedule 2.4(b) shall have been provided to Parent regarding their non-Israeli
residence and confirmation that they were granted such awards in consideration
solely for work or services performed outside of Israel; and (iii) with
respect to all other Company Options or Restricted Share Units, a Valid Tax
Certificate shall have been provided.

 



       
 

 



 

(c) Unless otherwise determined in the Withholding Tax Ruling, any withholding
made in New Israeli Shekels with respect to payments made hereunder in dollars
shall be calculated based on the US dollars to NIS exchange rate at the time
the relevant payment is made (but in any event not lower than the US dollars
to NIS exchange rate on the Closing Date). Any currency conversion commissions
will be borne by the applicable payment recipient and deducted from payments
to be made to such payment recipient.

 



 

(d) To the extent amounts are so deducted or withheld and paid over to the
appropriate Governmental Entity, the withheld amounts shall be treated for all
purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the Person in respect of
which such deduction and withholding was made. If a payor so deducts or
withholds amounts, the payor shall furnish in a timely manner the Person in
respect of which such deduction or withholding was made with documents
evidencing such deduction of withholding.

 



 

 **ARTICLE III** ** 
REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF THE COMPANY**

 



 

Except as and to the extent disclosed in the Company SEC Documents filed with
the SEC since December 31, 2016 and publicly available at least two calendar
days prior to the date of this Agreement (other than any disclosures set forth
in any risk factor section, in any section relating to forward looking
statements and any other disclosures included therein to the extent they are
predictive, cautionary or forward-looking in nature) or as set forth in the
corresponding section or subsection of the disclosure letter delivered by the
Company to Parent immediately prior to the execution of this Agreement (the "
_Company Disclosure Letter_ ") (it being agreed that the disclosure of any
information in a particular section or subsection of the Company Disclosure
Letter shall be deemed disclosure of such information with respect to any
other section or subsection of this Agreement to which the relevance of such
information is readily apparent on its face), the Company represents and
warrants to Parent and Merger Sub as follows:

 



 

Section 3.1 _Organization, Standing and Power_.

 



 

(a) Each of the Company and its Subsidiaries (i) is an entity duly organized,
validly existing and in good standing (with respect to jurisdictions that
recognize such concept) under the Laws of the jurisdiction of its
organization, (ii) has all requisite corporate or similar power and authority
to own, lease and operate its properties and to carry on its business as now
being conducted and (iii) is duly qualified or licensed to do business and is
in good standing (with respect to jurisdictions that recognize such concept)
in each jurisdiction in which the nature of its business or the ownership,
leasing or operation of its properties makes such qualification or licensing
necessary, except in the case of clause (iii), where the failure to be so
qualified or licensed or in good standing, individually or in the aggregate,
has not had and would not reasonably be expected to have, a Material Adverse
Effect.

 



 

(b) The Company has previously delivered to Parent true and complete copies of
the Companys articles of association (the " _Company s Articles of
Association_") and certificate of incorporation and bylaws (or comparable
organizational documents) of each of its Subsidiaries, in each case as amended
to the date of this Agreement, and each as so delivered is in full force and
effect. The Company is not in violation of any provision of the Companys

 



      
 

 



 

Articles of Association. None of the Companys Subsidiaries are in violation
of any provision of their certificate of incorporation or bylaws (or
comparable organizational documents). The Company has made available to Parent
true and complete copies of the minutes (or, in the case of draft minutes, the
most recent drafts thereof as of the date of this Agreement) of all meetings
of the Companys shareholders, the Company Board and each committee of the
Company Board held since January 1, 2015.

 



 

Section 3.2 _Share Capital_.

 



 

(a) The registered (authorized) share capital of the Company consists of NIS
50,000 divided into 50,000,000 Shares, NIS 0.01 per share. At the close of
business on April 26, 2018 (the " _Measurement Date_ "), (i) 26,582,910 Shares
(excluding treasury shares) were issued and outstanding, (ii) no Shares were
held by the Company in its treasury (dormant shares), (iii) there were
outstanding Company Options to purchase 1,924,934 Shares and (iv) there were
outstanding Company Warrants to purchase 7,718,025 Shares. All outstanding
share capital, other voting securities and equity interests of the Company
are, and all shares reserved for issuance will be, when issued, duly
authorized, validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable and not subject to
any preemptive rights and not subject to or issued in violation of any
purchase option, call option, right of first refusal, preemptive right,
subscription right or any similar right under any provision of the ICL, the
Companys Articles of Association or any Contract to which the Company is a
party or is otherwise bound. No share capital or equity interests of the
Company are owned by any Subsidiary of the Company. All outstanding share
capital and other voting securities or equity interests of each Subsidiary of
the Company have been duly authorized and validly issued, are fully paid,
nonassessable and not subject to any preemptive rights. All outstanding share
capital, other voting securities and equity interests of each such Subsidiary
are owned, directly or indirectly, by the Company, free and clear of all
pledges, claims, liens, charges, options, rights of first refusal,
encumbrances and security interests of any kind or nature whatsoever
(including any limitation on voting, sale, transfer or other disposition or
exercise of any other attribute of ownership) (collectively, " _Liens_ ").
Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has outstanding any bonds,
debentures, notes or other obligations having the right to vote (or
convertible into, or exchangeable or exercisable for, securities having the
right to vote) with the shareholders of the Company or such Subsidiary on any
matter. Except as set forth above in this _Section 3.2(a)_ and except for
changes since the close of business on the Measurement Date resulting from the
exercise of Company Options or Company Warrants described in _Section
3.2(b)_, there are no outstanding (A) share capital or other voting securities
or equity interests of the Company, (B) securities of the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries convertible into or exchangeable or exercisable for share
capital of the Company or other voting securities or equity interests of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries, (C) share appreciation rights, "phantom"
share rights, performance units, interests in or rights to the ownership or
earnings of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or other equity equivalent
or equity-based awards or rights, (D) subscriptions, options, warrants, calls,
commitments, Contracts or other rights to acquire from the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries, or obligations of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to
issue, any share capital of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, voting
securities, equity interests or securities convertible into or exchangeable or
exercisable for share capital or other voting securities or equity interests
of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or rights or interests described in
the preceding clause (C) or (E) obligations of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries to repurchase, redeem or otherwise acquire any such

 



      
 

 



 

securities or to issue, grant, deliver or sell, or cause to be issued,
granted, delivered or sold, any such securities. There are no shareholder
agreements, voting trusts or other agreements or understandings to which the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries is a party with respect to the holding,
voting, registration, redemption, repurchase or disposition of, or that
restrict the transfer of, any share capital or other voting securities or
equity interests of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries.

 



 

(b) Section 3.2(b) of the Company Disclosure Letter sets forth a true and
complete list of all holders, as of the close of business on the Measurement
Date, of outstanding Company Warrants, Company Options and other similar
rights to purchase or receive Shares or similar rights granted under the
Company Share Plans or otherwise (collectively, " _Company Share Awards_ "),
indicating as applicable, with respect to each Company Share Award then
outstanding, the type of award granted, the number of Shares subject to such
Company Share Award, the name of the plan under which such Company Share Award
was granted (if any), the date of grant, exercise or purchase price, vesting
schedule, payment schedule (if different from the vesting schedule) and
expiration thereof, and where applicable, whether each such Company Option is
a 102 Company Option or Company Option subject to Tax pursuant to section 3(i)
of the Ordinance and for 102 Company Options the date of deposit with the 102
Trustee (both with respect to the deposit of the board resolution and the
deposit of the option agreement). Each Company Option intended to qualify as
an "incentive stock option" under Section 422 of the Code so qualifies and the
exercise price of each other Company Option is no less than the fair market
value of a Share as determined on the date of grant of such Company Option, as
determined pursuant to Section 409A of the Code. The Company has made
available to Parent true and complete copies of all agreements relating to the
Company Warrants to which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is a party or
of which the Company has actual knowledge as of the date of this Agreement.
The Company has made available to Parent true and complete copies of all
Company Share Plans and the forms of all share option agreements evidencing
outstanding Company Options. All Company Options can be involuntarily
cancelled without the award holders consent upon the consummation of the
Merger (including any options cancelled hereunder with respect to which no
payment will be made).

 



 

(c) Section 3.2(c) of the Company Disclosure Letter sets forth a true and
complete list of all holders of 102 Shares, including the date of grant of the
102 Company Options out of which the 102 Shares were exercised and the date on
which such 102 Company Option were deposited with the 102 Trustee (both with
respect to the deposit of the board resolution and the deposit of the option
agreement) and the date of deposit of the 102 Shares with the 102 Trustee.

 



 

Section 3.3 _Subsidiaries_. Section 3.3 of the Company Disclosure Letter sets
forth a true and complete list of each Subsidiary of the Company, including
its jurisdiction of incorporation or formation, its shareholders, and, if
applicable, the individuals who comprise the board of directors or comparable
body. All of the outstanding share capital of, or other equity or voting
interests in, each Subsidiary of the Company (i) have been duly authorized,
validly issued and are fully paid and nonassessable and (ii) are wholly owned
by the Company, free and clear of all Liens (other than Liens under applicable
securities Laws) and free of any other restriction (including any restriction
on the right to vote, sell or otherwise dispose of such share capital or other
equity or voting interests) that would prevent the operation by the Surviving
Company of

 



      
 

 



 

such Subsidiarys business as presently conducted. Except for the share
capital of, or other equity or voting interests in, its Subsidiaries, the
Company does not own, directly or indirectly, any equity, membership interest,
partnership interest, joint venture interest, or other equity or voting
interest in, or any interest convertible into, exercisable or exchangeable for
any of the foregoing, nor is it under any obligation to form or participate
in, provide funds to, make any loan to, or capital contribution or other
investment in, any Person.

 



 

Section 3.4 _Authority_.

 



 

(a) The Company has all necessary corporate power and authority to execute and
deliver this Agreement and each Ancillary Agreement and to perform its
obligations hereunder and thereunder. The execution, delivery and performance
of this Agreement and each Ancillary Agreement by the Company and the
consummation by the Company of the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated hereby have been duly authorized by all necessary corporate
action on the part of the Company and no other corporate proceedings on the
part of the Company are necessary to approve this Agreement and each Ancillary
Agreement or to consummate the Merger and the other transactions contemplated
hereby, subject, in the case of the consummation of the Merger, to (i) the
approval and adoption of this Agreement and each Ancillary Agreement by the

Shareholders Meeting and (ii) either (A) the approval and adoption of this
Agreement and each Ancillary Agreement at the Company Shareholders Meeting by

number of Disinterested Voting Shares that are voted against the Agreement and
each Ancillary Agreement at the Company Shareholders Meeting does not exceed
two percent of the aggregate voting rights in the Company (the " _Company
Shareholders Approval_ "). For purposes of this Agreement, a " _Disinterested
Voting Share_ " is an outstanding Share that is held by a Person that does not
have a Personal Interest in the Agreement or any Ancillary Agreement. This
Agreement and each Ancillary Agreement have been duly executed and delivered
by the Company and, assuming the due authorization, execution and delivery by
Parent and Merger Sub, constitutes a valid and binding obligation of the
Company, enforceable against the Company in accordance with its terms (except
to the extent that enforceability may be limited by applicable bankruptcy,
insolvency, moratorium, reorganization or similar Laws affecting the
enforcement of creditors rights generally or by general principles of
equity).

 



 

(b) The Company Board, at a meeting duly called and held in compliance with
the requirements of the ICL and the Companys Articles of Association at which
all directors of the Company were present, duly and unanimously adopted
resolutions (i) determining that the terms of this Agreement, the Ancillary
Agreements, the Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby are fair
to and in the best interests of the Companys shareholders, and that,
considering the financial position of the merging companies, no reasonable
concern exists that the Surviving Company will be unable to fulfill the
obligations of the Company to its creditors when they become due, (ii)
approving and declaring advisable this Agreement and the transactions
contemplated hereby, including the Merger, (iii) directing that this Agreement
be submitted to the shareholders of the Company for adoption and (iv)
resolving to recommend that the Companys shareholders vote in favor of the
adoption of this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby, including
the Merger, and to include such Company

 



      
 

 



 

Board recommendation in the Proxy Statement for the approval of this Agreement
and the transactions contemplated hereby, which resolutions have not been
subsequently rescinded, modified or withdrawn in any way, except as may be
permitted by _Section 5.2_.

 



 

(c) The Company Shareholders Approval is the only vote of the holders of any
class or series of the Companys share capital or other securities required in
connection with the consummation of the Merger. No vote of the holders of any
class or series of the Companys share capital or other securities is required
in connection with the consummation of any of the transactions contemplated
hereby to be consummated by the Company other than the Merger.

 



 

Section 3.5 _No Conflict; Consents and Approvals_.

 



 

(a) The execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement and each
Ancillary Agreement by the Company does not, and the consummation of the
Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby and compliance by the
Company with the provisions hereof will not, conflict with, or result in any
violation or breach of, or default (with or without notice or lapse of time,
or both) under, or give rise to a right of, or result in, termination,
cancellation, modification or acceleration of any obligation or to the loss of
a material benefit under, or result in the creation of any Lien in or upon any
of the properties, assets or rights of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
under, or give rise to any increased, additional, accelerated or guaranteed
rights or entitlements under, or require any consent, waiver or approval of
any Person pursuant to, any provision of (i) the Articles of Association or
the certificate of incorporation or bylaws (or similar organizational
documents) of any Subsidiary of the Company, (ii) any bond, debenture, note,
mortgage, indenture, guarantee, license, lease, purchase or sale order or
other contract, or any other commitment, agreement, instrument intended to be
legally binding, obligation, undertaking, permit, concession or franchise,
whether oral or written (each, including all amendments thereto, a "
_Contract_ ") to which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is a party or by
which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or any of their respective
properties or assets may be bound or (iii) subject to the governmental filings
and other matters referred to in _Section 3.5(b)_, any federal, state, local
or foreign law (including common law), statute, ordinance, rule, code,
regulation, order, judgment, injunction, decree or other legally enforceable
requirement (" _Law_ ") or any rule or regulation of the Nasdaq Global Select
Market (" _NASDAQ_ ") applicable to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or
by which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or any of their respective
properties or assets may be bound, except in the case of clauses (ii) and
(iii), as would not be material to the Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as
a whole.

 



 

(b) No consent, clearance, approval, order or authorization of, or
registration, declaration, filing with or notice to, any Governmental Entity
(any of the foregoing being referred to herein as an " _Approval_ ") is
required by or with respect to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries in
connection with the execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement and
each Ancillary Agreement by the Company or the consummation by the Company of
the Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby or compliance with
the provisions hereof, except for (i) the filing of the pre-merger

Registrar and all such other notices or filings required under the ICL with
respect to the Merger including the issuance of the Certificate of Merger by
the Companies Registrar, (iv) any filings and approvals required under the
rules and regulations of NASDAQ, (v) the filing of a written notice to the
Israel Innovation Authority (previously, the Office of Chief Scientist, or
OCS) of the Israeli Ministry of Economy (previously, the Ministry of Industry
Trade and Labor) (the " _IIA_ " and the " _IIA Notice_ ", respectively)
regarding the change in ownership of the Company effected as a result of the
Merger, required to be submitted to the IIA in connection with the Merger in
accordance with the Israeli Encouragement of Industrial Research and
Development Law, 1984 (the " _R andD Law_") and (vi) such other consents,
approvals, orders, authorizations, registrations, declarations, filings or
notices the failure of which to be obtained or made, individually or in the
aggregate, is not, and would not reasonably be expected to be material to the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries.

 



 

Section 3.6 _SEC Reports; Financial Statements_.

 



 

(a) The Company has filed with or furnished to the Securities and Exchange
Commission (the " _SEC_ ") on a timely basis true and complete copies of all
forms, reports, schedules, statements and other documents required to be filed
with or furnished to the SEC by the Company since January 1, 2016 (all such
documents, together with all exhibits and schedules to the foregoing materials
and all information incorporated therein by reference, the " _Company SEC
Documents_ "). As of their respective filing dates (or, if amended or
superseded by a filing prior to the date of this Agreement, then on the date
of such filing), the Company SEC Documents complied in all material respects
with the applicable requirements of the Securities Act, the Exchange Act and
the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (the " _Sarbanes-Oxley Act_ "), as the case may
be, including, in each case, the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder,
and none of the Company SEC Documents contained any untrue statement of a
material fact or omitted to state a material fact required to be stated
therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of the
circumstances under which they were made, not misleading.

 



 

(b) The financial statements (including the related notes and schedules
thereto) included (or incorporated by reference) in the Company SEC Documents
(i) have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting
principles in the United States (" _GAAP_ ") (except, in the case of unaudited
statements, as permitted by Form 10-Q of the SEC) applied on a consistent
basis during the periods involved (except as may be indicated in the notes
thereto), (ii) comply as to form in all material respects with applicable
accounting requirements and the published rules and regulations of the SEC
with respect thereto and (iii) fairly present in all material respects the
consolidated financial position of the Company and its Subsidiaries as of the
dates thereof and their respective consolidated results of operations and cash
flows for the periods then ended (subject, in the case of unaudited
statements, to normal and recurring year-end audit adjustments that were not,
or are not expected to be, individually or in the aggregate, material in
amount), all in accordance with GAAP and the applicable rules and regulations
promulgated by the SEC. Since January 1, 2016, the Company has not made any
change in the accounting practices or policies applied in the preparation of
its financial statements, except as required by GAAP, SEC rule or policy or
applicable Law.

 



      
 

 



 

(c) The Company has established and maintains disclosure controls and
procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange
Act). Such disclosure controls and procedures are designed to ensure that
information relating to the Company, including its consolidated Subsidiaries,
required to be disclosed in the Companys periodic and current reports under
the Exchange Act, is made known to the Companys chief executive officer and
its chief financial officer by others within those entities to allow timely
decisions regarding required disclosures as required under the Exchange Act.
The chief executive officer and chief financial officer of the Company have
evaluated the effectiveness of the Companys disclosure controls and
procedures and, to the extent required by applicable Law, presented in any
applicable Company SEC Document that is a report on Form 10-K or Form 10-Q, or
any amendment thereto, its conclusions about the effectiveness of the
disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by such
report or amendment based on such evaluation.

 



 

(d) The Company and its Subsidiaries have established and maintain a system of
internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and
15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) which is effective in providing reasonable
assurance regarding the reliability of the Companys financial reporting and
the preparation of the Companys financial statements for external purposes in
accordance with GAAP. The Company has disclosed, based on its most recent
evaluation of the Companys internal control over financial reporting prior to
the date hereof, to the Companys auditors and audit committee (i) any
significant deficiencies and material weaknesses in the design or operation of
the Companys internal control over financial reporting which are reasonably
likely to adversely affect the Companys ability to record, process, summarize
and report financial information and (ii) any fraud, whether or not material,
that involves management or other employees who have a significant role in the
Companys internal control over financial reporting.

 



 

(e) Since January 1, 2016, neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries
nor, to the knowledge of the Company, any director, officer, employee,
auditor, accountant or representative of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries has received or otherwise had or obtained knowledge of any
material complaint, allegation, assertion or claim, whether written or oral,
regarding the accounting or auditing practices, procedures, methodologies or
methods of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or their respective internal
accounting controls, including any material complaint, allegation, assertion
or claim that the Company or any of its Subsidiaries has engaged in
questionable accounting or auditing practices.

 



 

(f) As of the date of this Agreement, there are no outstanding or unresolved
comments in the comment letters received from the SEC staff with respect to
the Company SEC Documents. To the knowledge of the Company, none of the
Company SEC Documents is subject to ongoing review or outstanding SEC comment
or investigation.

 



 

(g) Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries is a party to, or has any
commitment to become a party to, any joint venture, off balance sheet
partnership or any similar Contract (including any Contract or arrangement
relating to any transaction or relationship between or among the Company and
any of its Subsidiaries, on the one hand, and any unconsolidated Affiliate,
including any structured finance, special purpose or limited purpose entity or
Person, on the other hand, or any "off balance sheet arrangements" (as defined
in

 



      
 

 



 

Item 303(a) of Regulation S-K under the Exchange Act)), where the result,
purpose or intended effect of such Contract is to avoid disclosure of any
material transaction involving, or material liabilities of, the Company or any
of its Subsidiaries in the Companys or such Subsidiarys published financial
statements or other Company SEC Documents.

 



 

(h) The Company is in compliance in all material respects with (i) the
provisions of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and (ii) the rules and regulations of
NASDAQ, in each case, that are applicable to the Company.

 



 

(i) No Subsidiary of the Company is required to file any form, report,
schedule, statement or other document with the SEC.

 



 

Section 3.7 _No Undisclosed Liabilities_. Neither the Company nor any of its
Subsidiaries has any liabilities or obligations of any nature, whether
accrued, absolute, contingent or otherwise, known or unknown, whether due or
to become due, in each case, that are required to be recorded or reflected on
a balance sheet under GAAP, except (a) to the extent accrued or reserved
against in the audited consolidated balance sheet of the Company and its
Subsidiaries as of December 31, 2017 included in the Annual Report on Form
10-K filed by the Company with the SEC on March 30, 2017 (without giving
effect to any amendment thereto filed on or after the date hereof) (the "
_Annual Report"_ ), (b) for liabilities and obligations incurred in the
ordinary course of business consistent with past practice since December 31,
2017 (none of which is a liability resulting from breach of contract, breach

Section 5.2 _No Solicitation; Recommendation of the Merger_.

 



 

(a) The Company shall not, and shall not permit or authorize any of its
Subsidiaries or any director, officer, employee, investment banker, financial
advisor, attorney, accountant or other advisor, agent or representative
(collectively, " _Representatives_ ") of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries, directly or indirectly, to (i) solicit, initiate, endorse or
knowingly encourage or knowingly facilitate any inquiry, proposal or offer
with respect to, or the making or completion of, any Acquisition Proposal, or
any inquiry, proposal or offer that is reasonably likely to lead to any
Acquisition Proposal, (ii) enter into, continue or otherwise participate in
any discussions or negotiations regarding, or furnish to any Person any
information or data with respect to any Acquisition Proposal (except to
disclose the existence of this Section 5.2 and this Agreement in response to
an unsolicited communication) or (iii) resolve, agree or propose to do any of
the foregoing. The Company shall, and shall cause each of its Subsidiaries and
the Representatives of the Company and its Subsidiaries to, (A) immediately
cease and cause to be terminated all existing discussions and negotiations
with any Person conducted heretofore with respect to any Acquisition Proposal
or potential Acquisition Proposal and immediately terminate all physical and
electronic data room access previously granted to any such Person, (B) request
the prompt return or destruction of all confidential information previously
furnished with respect to any Acquisition Proposal or potential Acquisition
Proposal, and (C) not terminate, waive, amend, release or modify any provision
of any confidentiality or standstill agreement to which it or any of its
Affiliates or Representatives is a party with respect to any Acquisition
Proposal or potential Acquisition Proposal, provided, that (1) the Company
hereby waives any "dont ask" or similar provision in any confidentiality
agreement that could preclude a Person from seeking a waiver and (2) the
Company shall be permitted to grant waivers of any such standstill agreement,
but solely to the extent that the Company Board has determined in good faith,
after consultation with its outside counsel, that failure to take such action
would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties to the shareholders of the
Company under applicable Law (subject to Section 8.7). Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary herein, if at any time following the date of this
Agreement and prior to obtaining the Company Shareholders Approval, the
Company receives a written Acquisition Proposal that the Company Board
believes in good faith to be bona fide and such Acquisition Proposal did not
result from a breach of this _Section 5.2_, then (1) the Company and its
Representatives may contact the Person (or group of Persons) making such
Acquisition Proposal solely to clarify the terms and conditions thereof and
(2) if the Company Board determines in good faith (after consultation with
outside counsel and its financial advisor) that such Acquisition Proposal
constitutes or would reasonably be expected to lead to a Superior Proposal and
the Company Board determines in good faith (after consultation with outside
counsel) that the failure to take the actions referred to in clause (x) or (y)
below would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties to the shareholders of
the Company under applicable Law (subject to Section 8.7), then the Company
may also (x) furnish information with respect to the Company and its
Subsidiaries to the Person making such Acquisition Proposal pursuant to a
customary confidentiality agreement containing terms substantially similar to,
and no less favorable to the Company than, those set forth in the
Confidentiality Agreement (an " _Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement_ ");
_provided_ , that (I) the Company shall provide Parent a non-redacted copy of
each confidentiality agreement the Company has executed in accordance with
this _Section 5.2_ and (II) that any non-public information provided to any
such Person shall have been previously provided to Parent or shall be provided
to Parent prior to or concurrently with the time it is provided to such
Person, and

 



      
 

 



 

(y) participate in discussions or negotiations with the Person making such
Acquisition Proposal regarding such Acquisition Proposal.

 



 

(b) Neither the Company Board nor any committee thereof shall:

 



 

(i) (A) withdraw (or modify or qualify in any manner adverse to Parent or
Merger Sub) the recommendation or declaration of advisability by the Company
Board or any such committee of this Agreement, the Merger or any of the other
transactions contemplated hereby, (B) recommend or otherwise declare advisable
the approval by the Company shareholders of any Acquisition Proposal, or (C)
resolve, agree or propose to take any such actions (each such action set forth
in this _Section 5.2(b)(i)_ being referred to herein as an " _Adverse
Recommendation Change_ "); or

 



 

(ii) cause or permit the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to enter into any
letter of intent, memorandum of understanding, agreement in principle,
acquisition agreement, merger agreement, option agreement, joint venture
agreement, partnership agreement or other Contract, except for an Acceptable
Confidentiality Agreement (each, an " _Alternative Acquisition Agreement_ "),
in each case constituting or related to, or which is intended to or is
reasonably likely to lead to, any Acquisition Proposal, or resolve, agree or
propose to take any such actions.

 



 

(c) Notwithstanding the foregoing, at any time prior to obtaining the Company
Shareholders Approval, the Company Board may, if the Company Board determines
in good faith (after consultation with outside counsel) that the failure to do
so would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties to the shareholders of the
Company under applicable Law (subject to Section 8.7), taking into account all
adjustments to the terms of this Agreement that may be offered by Parent
pursuant to this _Section 5.2_, (x) make an Adverse Recommendation Change in
response to a Superior Proposal or (y) solely in response to a Superior
Proposal received after the date hereof that was unsolicited and did not
otherwise result from a breach of this _Section 5.2_, cause the Company to
terminate this Agreement in accordance with _Section 7.1(d)(ii)_ and
concurrently enter into a binding Alternative Acquisition Agreement with
respect to such Superior Proposal; _provided_ , _however_ , that the Company
may not make an Adverse Recommendation Change in response to a Superior
Proposal or terminate this Agreement pursuant to _Section 7.1(d)(ii)_ unless:

 



 

(i) the Company notifies Parent in writing at least five (5) Business Days
before taking such action of its intention to do so, and specifies the reasons
therefor, including the terms and conditions of, and the identity of the
Person making, such Superior Proposal, and contemporaneously furnishes a copy
(if any) of the proposed Alternative Acquisition Agreement and any other
relevant material transaction documents (it being understood and agreed that
any amendment to the financial terms or any other material term of such
Superior Proposal shall require a new written notice by the Company to Parent
pursuant to this _Section 5.2(c)(i)_, provided that the notice period with
respect to any such amended Superior Proposal shall be reduced to three (3)
Business Days); and

 



 

(ii) if Parent makes a proposal during such five (5) Business Day period to
adjust the terms and conditions of this Agreement, the Company Board, after
taking

 



      
 

 



 

into consideration the adjusted terms and conditions of this Agreement as
proposed by Parent, continues to determine in good faith (after consultation
with outside counsel and its financial advisor) that such Superior Proposal
continues to be a Superior Proposal and that the failure to make an Adverse
Recommendation Change or terminate this Agreement, as applicable, would be
inconsistent with its fiduciary duties to the shareholders of the Company
under applicable Law (subject to Section 8.7).

 



 

(iii) During the five Business Day period prior to its effecting an Adverse
Recommendation Change or terminating this Agreement as referred to above, the
Company shall, and shall cause its financial and legal advisors to, negotiate
with Parent in good faith (to the extent Parent seeks to negotiate) regarding
any revisions to the terms of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
proposed by Parent. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein,
neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries shall enter into any
Alternative Acquisition Agreement unless concurrently with such execution this
Agreement has been terminated in accordance with its terms (including the
payment of the Company Termination Fee pursuant to _Section 7.3(b)_, if
applicable).

 



 

(d) Other than in connection with an Acquisition Proposal, the Company Board
may make an Adverse Recommendation Change in response to a Change in
Circumstance, if and only if: (i) the Company Board determines in good faith,
after consultation with the Companys outside legal counsel and its financial
advisor, that the failure to do so would be inconsistent with the fiduciary
duties to the shareholders of the Company under applicable Law (subject to
Section 8.7); (ii) the Company shall have notified Parent at least five
business days prior to making any such Adverse Recommendation Change (a "
_Determination Notice_ "); and (iii) (A) the Company shall have specified the
Change in Circumstance in reasonable detail, (B) the Company shall have given
Parent the five business days after the Determination Notice to propose
revisions to the terms of this Agreement or make another proposal so that such
Change in Circumstance would no longer necessitate an Adverse Recommendation
Change, and shall have negotiated in good faith with Parent with respect to
such proposed revisions or other proposal, if any, and (C) after considering
the results of such negotiations and giving effect to the proposals made by
Parent, if any, after consultation with outside legal counsel and its
financial advisor, the Company Board shall have determined, in good faith,
that the failure to make the Adverse Recommendation Change in response to such
Change in Circumstance would be inconsistent with the fiduciary duties to the
shareholders of the Company under applicable Law (subject to Section 8.7). For
the avoidance of doubt, the provisions of this _Section 5.2(d)_ shall also
apply to any material change to the facts and circumstances relating to such
Change in Circumstance following the delivery of a Determination Notice with
respect thereto and shall require the delivery of a new Determination Notice
by the Company to Parent hereunder and compliance by the Company with the
requirements of the first sentence this _Section 5.2(d)_, except in such case
that the references to five business days shall be deemed to be three (3)
business days.

 



 

(e) In addition to the obligations of the Company set forth in _Section
5.2(a)_ and _Section 5.2(b)_, the Company promptly (and in any event within
forty-eight (48) hours of receipt) shall advise Parent in writing in the event
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or Representatives receives (i) any
indication by any Person that it is considering making an Acquisition
Proposal, (ii) any inquiry or request for information, discussion or
negotiation that is

 



      
 

 



 

related to or that contemplates an Acquisition Proposal, or (iii) any proposal
or offer that is or is reasonably likely to lead to an Acquisition Proposal,
in each case together with a description of the material terms and conditions
of and facts surrounding any such indication, inquiry, request, proposal or
offer, the identity of the Person making any such indication, inquiry,
request, proposal or offer, and a copy of any written proposal, offer or draft
agreement provided by such Person. The Company shall keep Parent informed
(orally and in writing) in all material respects on a timely basis of the
status and details (including, within forty-eight (48) hours after the
occurrence of any amendment, modification, development, discussion or
negotiation) of any such Acquisition Proposal, request, inquiry, proposal or
offer, including furnishing copies of any written inquiries, correspondence
and draft documentation, and written summaries of any material oral inquiries
or discussions. Without limiting any of the foregoing, the Company shall
promptly (and in any event within twenty-four (24) hours) notify Parent orally
and in writing if it determines to begin providing information or to engage in
discussions or negotiations concerning an Acquisition Proposal pursuant to
this _Section 5.2_ and shall in no event begin providing such information or
engaging in such discussions or negotiations prior to providing such notice.

 



 

(f) The Company shall not, and shall cause its Subsidiaries not to, enter into
any confidentiality agreement with any Person subsequent to the date of this
Agreement that would restrict the Companys ability to comply with any of the
terms of this _Section 5.2_.

 



 

(g) Nothing in this Agreement shall prohibit the Company Board from: (i)
taking and disclosing to the Companys shareholders a position contemplated by
Rule 14e-2(a) under the Exchange Act (or any communication under Israeli law
with substantially similar content) or a position contemplated by Section 329
of the ICL, or complying with the provisions of Rule 14d-9 or Item 1012(a) of
Regulation M-A promulgated under the Exchange Act; (ii) making any disclosure
to the shareholders of the Company that is required by applicable Law or (iii)
making any "stop, look and listen" communication pursuant to Rule 14d-9(f)
promulgated under the Exchange Act; provided, however, that any such
disclosure pursuant to the foregoing clauses "(i)" and "(ii)" (other than a
"stop, look and listen" communication or similar communication of the type
contemplated by Section 14d9(f) under the Exchange Act) shall be deemed to be
an Adverse Recommendation Change (including for purposes of _Section
7.1(c)(ii)_) unless the Company Board expressly reaffirms its recommendation
to the Companys shareholders in favor of the approval of this Agreement and
the Merger in such disclosure.

 



 

(h) For purposes of this Agreement:

 



 

(i) " _Acquisition Proposal_ " means any proposal or offer with respect to any
direct or indirect acquisition or purchase, in one transaction or a series of
related transactions, and whether through any merger, reorganization,
consolidation, tender offer, self-tender, exchange offer, share acquisition,

recapitalization, liquidation, dissolution, joint venture or otherwise, of (A)
assets or businesses of the Company and its Subsidiaries that generate fifteen
percent (15%) or more of the net revenues or net income (for the twelve- (12-)
month period ending on the last day of the Companys most recently completed
fiscal quarter) or that represent fifteen percent (15%) or more of the total
assets (based on fair market value) of the Company and its Subsidiaries, taken
as a whole, immediately prior to such transaction, or (B) fifteen percent
(15%) or more of any class of share capital, other equity securities or voting
power of the Company or any of its

 



      
 

 



 

Subsidiaries or any resulting parent company of the Company, in each case
other than the Merger and other transactions contemplated by this Agreement;
and

 



 

(ii) _"Change in Circumstance_ " means any material event or development or
material change in circumstances with respect to the Company that was not
known or reasonably foreseeable to the Company Board as of or prior to the
date of this Agreement and that becomes known to the Company Board prior to
the date the Company Shareholders Approval is obtained, and does not relate to
(A) any Acquisition Proposal or (B) any fluctuation in the market price or
trading volume of Shares, in and of itself; provided that the parties hereto
acknowledge that any rulings regarding applications submitted in connection
with any requests for a Permit from the FDA or other Governmental Entities
relating to the Pharmaceutical Products, including new drug applications, that
were made or will be made prior to Closing are reasonably foreseeable to the
Company Board as of the date of this Agreement and shall not constitute a
Change in Circumstance for purposes of this Agreement.

 



 

(iii) " _Superior Proposal_ " means any unsolicited bona fide written
Acquisition Proposal that the Company Board determines in good faith (after
consultation with outside counsel and its financial advisor), taking into
account all legal, financial, regulatory and other aspects of the proposal and
the Person making the proposal, is (A) more favorable to the shareholders of
the Company (in their capacity as such) from a financial point of view than
the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement
(including any adjustment to the terms and conditions proposed by Parent in
response to such proposal) and (B) reasonably likely of being completed on the
terms proposed; _provided_ , that, for purposes of this definition of
"Superior Proposal," references in the term "Acquisition Proposal" to "fifteen

as required by the Exchange Act and (ii) in consultation with Parent, set a
preliminary record date for the Company Shareholders Meeting in accordance

its staff with respect thereto, shall respond promptly to any such comments
made by the SEC or its staff with respect to the Proxy Statement, and shall

shareholders at the earliest practicable date. If at any time prior to
obtaining the Company Shareholders Approval, any information relating to the
Merger, the Company, Parent, Merger Sub or any of their respective Affiliates,
directors or officers should be discovered by the Company or Parent, or any
development should occur, that, in either case, should be set forth in an
amendment or supplement to the Proxy Statement so that such document would not
contain any misstatement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact
necessary to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under
which they were

 



      
 

 



 

made, not misleading, the party that discovers such information shall promptly
notify the other parties hereto and the Company shall promptly file with the
SEC an appropriate amendment or supplement describing such information and, to
the extent required by applicable Law, disseminate such amendment or
supplement to the shareholders of the Company. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
prior to filing or mailing the Proxy Statement (or any amendment or supplement
thereto) or responding to any comments of the SEC with respect thereto, the
Company shall give Parent, Merger Sub and their counsel a reasonable
opportunity to review and comment on such document or response and shall give
due consideration to all reasonable additions, deletions or changes suggested
thereto by Parent, Merger Sub and their counsel.

 



 

(b) As promptly as practicable after the Proxy Statement is cleared by the SEC
for mailing to the Companys shareholders, the Company shall duly call, give
notice of (with the proxy card ( _Ktav Hatzbaa_ ) required under the ICL and
the regulations promulgated thereunder), set the record date for, convene and
hold a special meeting of its shareholders in accordance with the applicable
provisions of the ICL and the Companys Articles of Association (the "
_Company Shareholders Meeting_ ") solely for the purpose of obtaining the
Company Shareholders Approval and, if applicable, the advisory vote required
by Rule 14a-21(c) under the Exchange Act in connection therewith. The Company
shall comply with the notice requirements applicable to the Company in respect
of the Company Shareholders Meeting pursuant to the ICL and the regulations
promulgated thereunder and the Companys Articles of Association. The Company
may postpone or adjourn the Company Shareholders Meeting solely (i) with the
consent of Parent; (ii) (A) due to the absence of a quorum or (B) if the
Company has not received proxies representing a sufficient number of Shares
for the Company Shareholders Approval, whether or not a quorum is present, to
solicit additional proxies; or (iii) to allow reasonable additional time for
the filing and mailing of any supplemental or amended disclosure which the
Company Board has determined in good faith after consultation with outside
legal counsel is necessary under applicable Law and for such supplemental or
amended disclosure to be disseminated and reviewed by the Companys
shareholders prior to the Company Shareholders Meeting; _provided_ , that the
Company may not postpone or adjourn the Company Shareholders Meeting more than
a total of two times pursuant to clause (ii)(A) and/or clause (ii)(B) of this
Section. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company shall, at the request of
Parent, to the extent permitted by Law, adjourn the Company Shareholders
Meeting to a date specified by Parent for the absence of a quorum or if the
Company has not received proxies representing a sufficient number of Shares
for the Company Shareholders Approval; _provided_ that the Company shall not
be required to adjourn the Company Shareholders Meeting more than two times
pursuant to this sentence, and no such adjournment pursuant to this sentence
shall be required to be for a period exceeding fifteen (15) days. To the
extent required, the Company shall set a new record date in accordance with
the applicable provisions of the ICL and Companys Articles of Association.
Except in the case of an Adverse Recommendation Change specifically permitted
by _Section 5.2(b)_, the Company, through the Company Board, shall (i)
recommend to its shareholders that they adopt this Agreement and the
transactions contemplated hereby, (ii) include such recommendation in the
Proxy Statement and (iii) publicly reaffirm such recommendation within three
Business Days after a request to do so by Parent or Merger Sub _provided_
that, unless an Acquisition Proposal shall have been publicly disclosed,
Parent may only make such request once every thirty days. Without limiting the
generality of the foregoing, the Company agrees that (x) except in the event
of an Adverse Recommendation Change specifically permitted by _Section
5.2(b)_, the Company shall use its commercially

 



       
 

 



 

reasonable efforts to solicit proxies to obtain the Company Shareholders
Approval and (y) its obligations pursuant to this _Section 5.2(b)_ shall not
be affected by the commencement, public proposal, public disclosure or
communication to the Company or any other Person of any Acquisition Proposal
or the occurrence of any Adverse Recommendation Change. In the event that
Parent, Merger Sub or any Person listed in Section 320(c) of the ICL casts any
votes in respect of the Merger, Parent shall disclose to the Company its
interest in the Shares so voted.

promptly as practicable following the date hereof, the Company and Merger Sub,
as applicable, shall take the following actions within the timeframes set
forth herein; _provided_ , _however_ , that any such actions or the timeframe
for taking such action shall be subject to any amendment in the applicable
provisions of the ICL and the regulations promulgated thereunder (and in case
of an amendment thereto, such amendment shall automatically apply so as to
amend this _Section 5.4(a)_ accordingly): (i) cause a merger proposal (in the
Hebrew language) in a form reasonably acceptable to the parties hereto (the "
_Merger Proposal_ ") to be executed in accordance with Section 316 of the ICL,
(ii) deliver the Merger Proposal, signed by an authorized director of each of
Merger Sub and Company (which signature shall be certified by an attorney at
law), to the Companies Registrar within three days from the calling of the
Company Shareholders Meeting, (iii) cause a copy of the Merger Proposal to be
delivered to its secured creditors, if any, no later than three days after the
date on which the Merger Proposal is delivered to the Companies Registrar,
(iv) promptly after the Company shall have complied with the preceding
sentence and with clauses (A) and (B) of _Section 5.4(a)(v)_, but in any
event no more than three days following the date on which such notice was sent
to the creditors, the Company and Merger Sub shall inform the Companies
Registrar, in accordance with Section 317(b) of the ICL, that notice was given
to their respective creditors, if any, under Section 318 of the ICL (and
regulations promulgated thereunder), (v) each of the Company and, if
applicable, Merger Sub, shall: (A) publish a notice to its creditors, stating
that a Merger Proposal was submitted to the Companies Registrar and that the
creditors may review the Merger Proposal at the office of the Companies
Registrar, the Companys registered office or Merger Subs registered offices,
as applicable, and at such other locations as the Company or Merger Sub, as
applicable, may determine, in (I) two daily Hebrew newspapers, on the day that
the Merger Proposal is submitted to the Companies Registrar, and (II) in a
popular newspaper in New York within three business days after the date on
which the Merger Proposal is delivered to the Companies Registrar; (B) within
four business days from the date of submitting the Merger Proposal to the
Companies Registrar, send a notice by registered mail to all of the
"Substantial Creditors" (as such term is defined in the regulations
promulgated under the ICL) that the Company or Merger Sub, as applicable, is
aware of, in which it shall state that a Merger Proposal was submitted to the
Companies Registrar and that the creditors may review the Merger Proposal at
such additional locations, if such locations were determined in the notice
referred to in the immediately preceding clause (A); and (C) send to the
Companys "employees committee" ( _Va ad Ovdim_) (if any) or display in a
prominent place at the Companys premises a copy of the notice published in a
daily Hebrew newspaper (as referred to in clause (A)(I) of this _Section
5.4(a)(v)_), no later than three business days following the day on which the
Merger Proposal was submitted to the Companies Registrar, (vi) not later than
three days after the date on which the Company Shareholders Approval is
received, the Company shall

 



      
 

 



 

(in accordance with Section 317(b) of ICL and the regulations thereunder)
inform the Companies Registrar of such approval in accordance with the
customary practice of the Companies Registrar, (vii) within thirty days from
the date on which the notice to the Companys creditors was published in two
daily Israeli newspapers published in Hebrew, the Company shall submit notice
to the Companies Registrar notifying that no claim were filed against the
Merger to Court, and (viii) the Company and Merger Sub shall submit notice to
the Companies Registrar notifying it that all the conditions precedent to the
Merger have been satisfied and request, following coordination between each
other, that the Companies Registrar declare the Merger effective and issue the
Certificate of Merger upon such date as the Company and Merger Sub shall
advise the Companies Registrar, provided that such date is not earlier than
thirty days from the date of the shareholder meetings in each of the Company
and Merger Sub and not earlier than fifty days from the date on which the
Merger Proposal was submitted to the Companies Registrar, pursuant to Section
323 of the ICL. For the avoidance of doubt, and notwithstanding any provision
of this Agreement to the contrary, it is the intention of the parties that the
Merger shall be declared effective and the Certificate of Merger shall be
issued on the Closing Date, as a condition to the Closing taking place. For
purposes of this _Section 5.4(a)_, "business day" shall have the meaning set
forth in the Israeli Companies Regulations (Merger) 5760-2000 promulgated
under the ICL.

 



 

(b) The sole shareholder of Merger Sub has approved the Merger subject to the
satisfaction or waiver (to the extent permitted hereunder) of all the
conditions to Closing (other than those that by their nature may only be
satisfied or waived at Closing). No later than three days after the date of
such approval, Merger Sub shall (in accordance with Section 317(b) of the ICL
and the regulations thereunder) inform the Companies Registrar of such

Parent, Merger Sub and their respective Representatives reasonable access
during normal business hours, during the period prior to the Effective Time or
the termination of this Agreement in accordance with its terms, to all their
respective properties, assets, books, contracts, commitments, personnel and
records and, during such period, the Company shall, and shall cause each of
its Subsidiaries to, furnish promptly to Parent: (a) a copy of each material

consolidated financial statements of the Company and its Subsidiaries, if and
to the extent prepared in the ordinary course of business consistent with past

and personnel as Parent or Merger Sub may reasonably request (including Tax
Returns filed and those in preparation and the work papers of its auditors);
_provided_ , _however_ , that the foregoing shall not require the Company to
disclose any information to the extent such disclosure would (x) contravene
applicable Law, the fiduciary duties of the Company Board or any binding
agreement entered into prior to the date of this Agreement (including any
confidentiality agreement to which the Company or its Subsidiary is a party)
(provided that the Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to
communicate the applicable information to Parent in a way that would not
violate the applicable Law, fiduciary duty or agreement) or (y) give rise to a
material risk of waiving any attorney-client privilege, work product doctrine
or other applicable privilege applicable to such

 



      
 

 



 

documents or information, in which case the parties shall execute a standard
joint defense agreement so as to permit Parent to have access to such
information. All such information shall be held confidential in accordance
with the terms of the Confidentiality Agreement. Subject to compliance with
applicable Law, from the date hereof until the earlier of the termination of
this Agreement and the Effective Time, the Company shall confer from time to
time as reasonably requested by Parent with Parent or its Representatives to
discuss any material changes or developments in the operational matters of the
Company and the general status of the ongoing operations of the Company. No
investigation pursuant to this _Section 5.5_ or information provided, made
available or delivered to Parent pursuant to this Agreement shall affect any
of the representations, warranties, covenants, rights or remedies, or the
conditions to the obligations of, the parties hereunder.

 



 

(b) Not less than five (5) Business Days prior to the Closing, the Company
will deliver to Parent the Companys good faith estimate of (i) Cash, (ii) the

(c) The Company promptly (and in any event within forty-eight (48) hours of
obtaining such knowledge) shall advise Parent in writing in the event that any
key employee or officer of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries notifies or
expresses to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries of its intent to terminate
his employment relationship with such entity following the consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby, except as set forth on Schedule 3.13(e) of
the Company Disclosure Letter.

 



 

Section 5.6 _Commercially Reasonable Efforts; Merger Proposal; Certificate of
Merger_.

 



 

(a) Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement,
each of the parties agrees to use commercially reasonable efforts to take, or
cause to be taken, all actions that are necessary, proper or advisable to
consummate and make effective, in the most expeditious manner practicable, the
Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including
using commercially reasonable efforts to accomplish the following: (i) cause

that neither Parent nor Merger Sub shall be required to grant any additional
consideration to any third party or incur any additional costs in order to
obtain any such consent, waiver, authorization or approval from any
Governmental Entity, except, in each case, for reasonable out-of-pocket
expenses to the extent incurred in performing the actions to be taken under
this _Section 5.6_ and for filing fees payable to Governmental Entities, and
(iv) execute and deliver any additional instruments necessary to consummate
the transactions contemplated hereby and fully to carry out the purposes of
this Agreement, provided, however, that neither the Company nor any of its
Subsidiaries shall (x) make any offer, acceptance or counter-offer to or
otherwise engage in negotiations or discussion with any

 



      
 

 



 

Governmental Entity with respect to any proposed settlement, timing of the
Closing Date, consent decree, commitment or remedy, or, in the event of
litigation, discovery, admissibility of evidence, timing or scheduling, (y)
commit to the payment of any fee, penalty or other consideration or (z) make
any other concession, waiver or amendment under any Contract in connection
with obtaining any consent, in each case, without the prior written consent of
Parent.

 



 

(b) Without limiting the generality of _Section 5.6(a)_, each of Parent and
Merger Sub shall, and shall cause their respective Affiliates to, if
applicable, on the one hand, and the Company, on the other hand, file with the
applicable Governmental Entity the notifications required under the HSR Act
(which filings shall request early termination of the waiting period under the
HSR Act) or other Antitrust Laws with respect to the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement, in each case as soon as reasonably practicable after the
date of this Agreement, but in no event later than fifteen Business Days
following the execution and delivery of this Agreement. Parent shall pay all
filing fees, application fees or other fees of the applicable Governmental
Entity associated with the HSR Act filing and any filings under other
Antitrust Laws. Each of the parties shall furnish promptly to the Federal
Trade Commission (the " _FTC_ "), the Antitrust Division of the United States
Department of Justice (the " _Antitrust Division_ ") and any other requesting
Governmental Entity any additional information requested pursuant to the HSR
Act or other Antitrust Laws in connection with such filings. Parent and its
Affiliates shall exercise reasonable best efforts to (i) obtain termination or
expiration of the waiting period under the HSR Act and (ii) prevent the entry
in any Action brought by a Governmental Entity or any other Person that would
prohibit, make unlawful or delay the consummation of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, including exercising reasonable best efforts
and responding promptly to requests for documents or information by any
Governmental Entity in connection with the foregoing. In connection therewith,
if any Action is instituted (or threatened to be instituted) challenging any
transactions contemplated by this Agreement as in violation of the HSR Act or
any Antitrust Law, the Company and its Affiliates shall use their reasonable
best efforts to provide full and effective support to Parent and Merger Sub to
contest and resist any such Action, including to prevent the entry in any
Action brought by an Governmental Entity which would prohibit, make unlawful
or delay the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.
The parties will notify each other promptly of any oral communication with,
and provide copies of written communications with, any Governmental Entity in
connection with any filings made pursuant to this _Section 5.6(b)_. Each of
the parties shall cooperate reasonably with the other parties in connection
with any such filing (including, to the extent permitted by applicable Law,
providing copies of all such documents to the non-filing parties prior to
filing and considering all reasonable additions, deletions or changes
suggested in connection therewith) and in connection with resolving any
investigation or other inquiry of the FTC, the Antitrust Division or any other
Governmental Entity under any Antitrust Laws with respect to any such filing.
No party hereto shall independently participate in any meeting,
teleconference, or other written or oral communication with any Governmental
Entity in respect of any such filing, investigation or other inquiry without
giving the other parties prior notice of the meeting and, to the extent
permitted by such Governmental Entity, the opportunity to attend and/or
participate. To the extent permitted by applicable Laws, and subject to all
applicable privileges (including the attorney client privilege), each of the
parties shall consult and cooperate reasonably with the other parties, and
shall consider in good faith the views of each other, in connection with any
analyses, appearances, presentations, memoranda, briefs, arguments, opinions
and proposals made or submitted by or on behalf of any party hereto in

 



      
 

 



 

connection with proceedings under or relating to the HSR Act or other
Antitrust Laws. Each of the parties may, as it deems advisable and necessary,
reasonably designate any competitively sensitive material provided to the
other Parties under this _Section 5.6(b)_ as "outside counsel only." Such
materials and the information contained therein shall be given only to the
outside legal counsel of the recipient and will not be disclosed by such
outside legal counsel to employees, officers, or directors of the recipient,
unless express written permission is obtained in advance from the source of
the materials.

 



 

(c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement and
in this _Section 5.6_, nothing in this Agreement shall require Parent, the
Surviving Company or any other subsidiary of Parent to agree or propose to (i)
sell, hold separate, license or otherwise dispose of any assets or conduct
their business in a specified manner, (ii) permit or agree to the sale,
holding separate, licensing or other disposition of, any assets of Parent, the
Surviving Company or any other subsidiary of Parent or the Company, or (iii)
take or refrain from taking, or agree to their Subsidiaries or Affiliates
taking or refraining from taking, any action or suffer to exist any condition,
limitation, restriction or requirement with any other actions, conditions,
limitations, restrictions or requirements that could reasonably be expected to
result in a material impairment of the benefits that Parent and Merger Sub
reasonably expect to derive from the consummation of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, (iv) provide any capital contribution,
guarantee, indemnity or other financial support to any Person, (v) limit
dividends or distributions by any Person, or (vi) limit the exercise of voting
power under equity securities of any Person, whether as a condition to
obtaining any approval from, or to avoid potential litigation or
administrative action by, a Governmental Entity or any other Person or for any
other reason.

 



 

Section 5.7 _Takeover Laws_. The Company and the Company Board shall (a) take
no action to cause any "moratorium," "fair price," "business combination,"
"control share acquisition" or similar provision of any state anti-takeover
Law (collectively, " _Takeover Laws_ ") to become applicable to this
Agreement, the Merger or any of the other transactions contemplated hereby and
(b) if any Takeover Law is or becomes applicable to this Agreement, the Merger
or any of the other transactions contemplated hereby, take all action
necessary to ensure that the Merger and the other transactions contemplated
hereby may be consummated as promptly as practicable on the terms contemplated
by this Agreement and otherwise to minimize the effect of such Takeover Law
with respect to this Agreement, the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated hereby.

 



 

Section 5.8 _Notification of Certain Matters_. The Company and Parent shall
promptly notify each other of (a) any notice or other communication received
by such party from any Governmental Entity in connection with the Merger or
the other transactions contemplated hereby or from any Person alleging that
the consent of such Person is or may be required in connection with the
transactions contemplated hereby, (b) any other notice or communication from
any Governmental Entity in connection with the transactions contemplated
hereby, (c) any Action commenced or, to such partys knowledge, threatened
against, relating to or involving or otherwise affecting such party or any of
its Subsidiaries which relate to the transactions contemplated hereby or (d)
any change, condition or event (i) that renders or would reasonably be
expected to render any representation or warranty of such party set forth in
this Agreement to be untrue or inaccurate in any material respect, or (ii)
that results or would reasonably be

 



      
 

 



 

expected to result in any failure of such party to comply with or satisfy in
any material respect any covenant, condition or agreement (including any
condition set forth in _Article VI_) to be complied with or satisfied
hereunder; _provided_ , _however_ , that with respect to any such change,
condition or event described in the foregoing clause (d)(i) that would not
result in the failure of a condition set forth in _Article VI_, the
applicable partys obligation to notify the other party "promptly" shall be
deemed satisfied if such notification is delivered within seven days of such
party becoming aware of the applicable change condition or event; _provided_ ,
_further_ , that no such notification shall affect any of the representations,
warranties, covenants, rights or remedies, or the conditions to the
obligations of, the parties hereunder; and _provided_ , _further_ , that an
unintentional failure to provide such notification shall not constitute a
breach of a covenant for purposes of the closing conditions set forth in
_Article VI_.

 



 

Section 5.9 _Indemnification, Exculpation and Insurance_.

 



 

(a) Parent agrees that all rights to indemnification, advancement of expenses

to the Effective Time now existing in favor of the current or former directors
or officers of the Company (each, an " _Indemnified Person_ ") acting in such
capacities as provided in the Companys Articles of Association and any
indemnification or other agreements of the Company as in effect on the date of
this Agreement (to the extent that copies have been made available to Parent
prior to the date of this Agreement) (collectively " _Existing Indemnification
Obligations_ ") shall be assumed by the Surviving Company in the Merger,
without further action, at the Effective Time, and shall survive the Merger

_provided_ , that such obligations shall be subject to any limitation imposed
from time to time under applicable Law. Parent shall cause the Surviving
Company to comply with the Existing Indemnification Obligations.

to, obtain and fully pay for, at no expense to the individual insureds
thereunder, non-cancellable "tail" insurance policies with claims periods of
at least seven years from and after the Effective Time from insurance carriers
with the same or better claims-paying ability ratings as the Companys
insurance carriers with respect to directors and officers liability
insurance policies and fiduciary liability insurance policies in place
immediately prior to the Effective Time (collectively, "DandO Insurance") for
the persons who are covered by the Companys existing DandO Insurance, with

the insured individuals as the Companys existing DandO Insurance with respect
to matters existing or occurring at or prior to the Effective Time (including
in connection with this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby);
provided, however, that the Company shall not pay, or the Surviving Company
shall not be required to pay, as the case may be, for such "tail" extended

fiscal year, which amount the Company hereby represents is as set forth in
Section 5.9(b) of the Company Disclosure Letter.

 



 

(c) The provisions of this _Section 5.9_ shall survive consummation of the
Merger, shall be binding upon the successors and assigns of Parent and the

and are intended to be for the benefit of, and shall be enforceable by, each
Indemnified Person, his or her heirs and his or her legal representatives.

release or other public statements with respect to this Agreement, the Merger
and the other transactions contemplated hereby and shall not issue any such
press release or make any public announcement prior to such consultation and
review, except: (i) as may be required by applicable Law, court process or by
obligations pursuant to any listing agreement with any national securities
exchange or national securities quotation system; (ii) that the foregoing
shall not apply to: (1) any press release or public statement made in response

Company shall cooperate, including by making changes to the form of CVR
Agreement attached hereto as _Exhibit A_ ( _provided_ , that such revisions

necessary to ensure that the CVRs are not subject to registration under the
Securities Act, the Exchange Act or any applicable state securities or "blue
sky" laws.

 



 

Section 5.17 _Tax Rulings_.

 



 

(a) As soon as practicable after the date of this Agreement the Company shall
instruct its Israeli counsel, advisors and/or accountants to prepare and file
with the ITA, in full coordination with Parents advisors, an application for
a ruling (which shall be confirmed by Parents advisors prior to its
submission) confirming that: (i) Parent and anyone on its behalf shall be
exempt from withholding tax in relation to payments made under this Agreement
to the 102 Trustee in relation to any 102 Company Options, 3(i) Company
Options and 102 Shares; (ii) the payment of any Merger Consideration upon the
cancellation of 102 Company Options or purchase of 102 Shares with respect to
which the requisite period has not passed, will not constitute a violation of
the requirements of Section 102 of the Ordinance as long as such consideration
is deposited with the 102 Trustee; (iii) that the CVR Consideration will be
subject to tax only upon payment to the holders of 102 Company Options and 102
Shares (which ruling may be subject to customary conditions regularly
associated with such a ruling and which may include additional issues which
are raised by the ITA in light of the factual background of the ruling
request) (the " _Option Tax Ruling_ "). The Company shall include in the
request for the Option Tax Ruling a request to exempt Parent, the Surviving
Company, the Paying Agent and their respective agents from any withholding
obligation with respect to the transfer of the portion of the 102 Company
Options and 102 Shares in the Merger Consideration to the 102 Trustee. Each of
the Company and Parent shall cause its respective Israeli counsel, advisors
and accountants to coordinate all activities, and to cooperate with each
other, with respect to the preparation and filing of such application and with
respect to any written or oral submission that may be necessary, proper or
advisable in order to obtain the Option Tax Ruling. Subject to the terms and
conditions hereof, the Company shall use reasonable best efforts to promptly
take, or cause to be taken, all action and to do, or cause to be done, all
things necessary under applicable Law to obtain the Option Tax Ruling, as
promptly as practicable. To avoid doubt, the final text of the Option Tax
Ruling or the Interim Option Tax Ruling, if required shall be subject to the
prior written confirmation of Parent or its counsel, which consent shall not
unreasonably be

 



      
 

 



 

withheld, conditioned or delayed. If the Option Tax Ruling is not granted
prior to the Closing, the Company shall seek to obtain prior to the Closing an
interim Tax ruling confirming, among other things, that Parent and any Person
acting on its behalf (including the Paying Agent) shall be exempt from Israeli
withholding tax in relation to any payments made with respect to any Company
Options or Shares to the Paying Agent and/or the 102 Trustee in connection
with the Merger (the " _Interim Option Tax Ruling_ "). To the extent that
prior to the Closing an Interim Option Tax Ruling shall have been obtained,
then all references herein to the Option Tax Ruling shall be deemed to refer
to such Interim Option Tax Ruling, until such time that a final definitive
Option Tax Ruling is obtained.

 



 

(b) As soon as practicable following the date of this Agreement, Parent shall
instruct its Israeli counsel, advisors and accountants to, in coordination
with the Company and its Israeli counsel, advisors and accountants, prepare
and file with the ITA an application for a ruling that (i) with respect to
holders of Shares and Company Warrants that are non-Israeli residents (as
defined in the Ordinance or as will be determined by the ITA), (A) exempting
Parent, the Paying Agent, the Surviving Company and their respective agents
from any obligation to withhold Israeli Tax at the source from any
consideration payable or otherwise deliverable pursuant to this Agreement,
including the Merger Consideration, or clarifying that no such obligation
exists, or (B) clearly instructing Parent, the Paying Agent, the Surviving
Company and their respective agents on how such withholding at the source is
to be executed, and in particular, with respect to the classes or categories
of holders of the Shares and Company Warrants from which Israeli Tax is to be
withheld (if any), the rate or rates of Tax withholding to be applied and how
to identify any such non-Israeli residents; and (ii) with respect to holders
of Shares and Company Warrants that are Israeli residents (as defined in the
Ordinance or as will be determined by the ITA) (other than the 102 Shares) (x)
exempting Parent, the Paying Agent, the Surviving Company and their respective
agents from any obligation to withhold Israeli Tax at the source from any
consideration payable or otherwise deliverable pursuant to this Agreement,
including the Merger Consideration, or clarifying that no such obligation
exists, or (y) clearly instructing Parent, the Paying Agent, the Surviving
Company and their respective agents on how such withholding at the source is
to be executed, and in particular, with respect to the classes or categories
of holders of the Shares and Company Warrants from which Tax is to be withheld
(if any), the rate or rates of withholding to be applied (the " _Withholding
Tax Ruling_ ").

 



 

(c) Without limiting the generality of _Section 5.6_, each of the Company and
Parent shall cause their respective Israeli counsel, advisors and accountants
to cooperate with each other, with respect to the preparation and filing of
such application. The final text of the Interim Option Tax Ruling, the Option
Tax Ruling and the Withholding Tax Ruling shall be subject to the prior
written confirmation of Parent or its counsel, which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed. The Company and its
Representatives shall not make any application to, or conduct any negotiation
with, the ITA with respect to matters relating to the Interim Option Tax
Ruling (if required), the Option Tax Ruling and the Withholding Tax Ruling
without prior coordination with Parent or its Representatives, and will enable
Parents Representatives to participate in all discussions and meetings with
the ITA relating thereto. To the extent that Parents Representatives elect
not to participate in any such meeting or discussion, the Companys
Representatives shall provide Parents Representatives a report of the
discussions and/or meetings held with the ITA. Subject to the terms and
conditions hereof, the Company shall use commercially reasonable efforts to
promptly take, or cause to be

 



      
 

 



 

taken, all action and to do, or cause to be done, all things necessary, proper
or advisable under applicable Laws to obtain the Interim Option Tax Ruling,
the Option Tax Ruling (if required) and the Withholding Tax Ruling, as
promptly as practicable.

 



 

Section 5.18 _Employee Matters_.

 



 

(a) Each employee who is an employee of the Company or a Subsidiary
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be referred to as a "
_Continuing Employee_ ". During the period beginning as of the Effective Time
and ending no earlier than the first (1st) anniversary of the Effective Time
(the " _Benefit Period_ "), Parent shall provide each Continuing Employee with
(i) at least the same level of base wages or base salary, as applicable, and
cash bonus opportunity, in each case as provided to the Continuing Employee
immediately prior to the Effective Time and (ii) employee benefits that are
substantially similar in the aggregate to the employee benefits that are
provided to similarly situated employees of Parent who are located in the same
country.

 



 

(b) Parent shall, and shall cause its Affiliates to, grant all Continuing
Employees credit for any service to the Company and its Affiliates earned
prior to the Closing for purposes of eligibility, vesting and determination of
the level of benefits, vacation and paid time off accrual and severance
benefit determinations, under any benefit or compensation plan, program,
agreement or arrangement in which a Continuing Employee participates that may
be established or maintained by Parent or its Affiliates on or after the
Effective Time (the " _New Plans_ "); provided, however, that such service
credit shall not be recognized to the extent that it would result in a
duplication of benefits for the same period of time. In addition, Parent
shall, and shall cause its Affiliates to, use commercially reasonable efforts
to cause (i) to be waived all pre-existing condition exclusions and actively-
at-work requirements and similar limitations, eligibility waiting periods and
evidence of insurability requirements under any New Plans to the extent waived
with respect to or satisfied by a Continuing Employee (or covered dependent
thereof) under any Company benefit plan as of the Effective Time and (ii) any
deductible, co-insurance and covered out-of-pocket expenses paid on or before
the Closing by any Continuing Employee (or covered dependent thereof) to be
taken into account for purposes of satisfying the corresponding deductible,
coinsurance and maximum out-of-pocket provisions after the Effective Time
under any applicable New Plan in the same plan year in which the Closing
occurs.

 



 

(c) Nothing contained herein, express or implied, (x) is intended to confer
upon any Continuing Employee any right to continued employment for any period
or continued receipt of any specific employee benefit, or shall constitute an
amendment to or any other modification of any benefit plan, (y) shall alter or
limit Parents or the Companys or their Affiliates ability to amend, modify
or terminate any particular benefit plan, program, agreement or arrangement or
shall constitute an amendment of any such benefit plan, program, agreement or
arrangement, or (z) is intended to confer upon any individual (including
employees, retirees or dependents or beneficiaries of employees or retirees)
any right as a third party beneficiary of this Agreement.

 **ARTICLE VII** ** 
TERMINATION, AMENDMENT AND WAIVER**

 



 

Section 7.1 _Termination_. This Agreement may be terminated and the Merger may
be abandoned at any time prior to the Effective Time, whether before or after
the Company Shareholders Approval has been obtained (with any termination by
Parent also being an effective termination by Merger Sub):

 



 

(a) by mutual written consent of Parent and the Company;

 



 

(b) by either Parent or the Company:

 



 

(i) if the Merger shall not have been consummated on or before August 31, 2018
(the " _Initial Outside Date_ "); _provided_ , that (A) the Initial Outside
Date may be extended by mutual written consent of Parent and the Company up to
two times, each time for a period of time not to exceed 90 days and (B) if on
the Initial Outside Date, the condition set forth in _Section 6.2(f)_ is not
satisfied but all of the other conditions to Closing are satisfied (other than
those conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied at the Closing),
then either Parent or the Company may, at their option exercisable by
delivering written notice to the other party prior to the Initial Outside
Date, extend the Initial Outside Date until the date that is 90 days after the
Initial Outside Date (the Initial Outside Date as may be extended in
accordance with the foregoing clauses (A) or (B), the " _Outside Date_ "),
_provided further_ , that the right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to
this _Section 7.1(b)(i)_ shall not be available to any party whose failure to
fulfill in any material respect any of its obligations under this Agreement
has been the primary cause of, or the primary factor that resulted in, the
failure of the Merger to be consummated by the Outside Date;

 



 

(ii) if any court of competent jurisdiction or other Governmental Entity shall
have issued a judgment, order, injunction, rule or decree, or taken any other
action permanently restraining, permanently enjoining or otherwise permanently
prohibiting any of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and such
judgment, order, injunction, rule, decree or other action shall have become
final and non-appealable or any Governmental Entity shall have finally and
non-appealable declined to grant any of the approvals of any Governmental
Entity the receipt of which is necessary to satisfy the condition set forth in
_Section 6.1(c)_; _provided_ , that the party seeking to terminate this
Agreement pursuant to this _Section 7.1(b)(ii)_ shall have used its
reasonable best efforts to contest, appeal and remove such judgment, order,
injunction, rule, decree, ruling or other action in accordance with _Section
5.6_, and the right to terminate this Agreement under this Section 7.1(b)(ii)
shall not be available to a party if the

 



      
 

 



 

issuance of such judgment, order, injunction, rule, decree, ruling or other
action was primarily due to the failure of such party to perform in any
material respects any of its obligations under this Agreement;

 



 

(iii) if the Company Shareholders Approval shall not have been obtained at the
Company Shareholders Meeting duly convened therefor or at any adjournment or
postponement thereof at which a vote on the adoption of this Agreement was
taken; _provided_ that a party shall not be permitted to terminate this
Agreement pursuant to this Section 7.1(b)(iii) if the failure to obtain the
Company Shareholder Approval is attributable to a failure on the part of such
party to perform in any material respect any covenant or obligation in this
Agreement required to be performed by such party; or

 



 

(iv) if the FTC or the U.S. Department of Justice issues a request for
additional information or documentary material under 15 U.S.C. Section 18a(e)
in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement;

 



 

(c) by Parent:

 



 

(i) if the Company shall have breached or failed to perform any of its
representations, warranties, covenants or agreements set forth in this
Agreement (other than with respect to a breach of _Section 5.2_ or _Section
5.3(b)_, as to which _Section 7.1(c)(ii)(D)_ will apply), or if any
representation or warranty of the Company shall have become untrue, in each
case, which breach or failure to perform or to be true, either individually or
in the aggregate, if occurring or continuing at the Effective Time (A) would
result in the failure of any of the conditions set forth in _Section 6.1_ or
_Section 6.2_ and (B) cannot be or has not been cured by the earlier of (1)
the Outside Date and (2) thirty (30) days after the giving of written notice
to the Company of such breach or failure; _provided_ , that Parent shall not
have the right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this _Section
7.1(c)(i)_ if Parent or Merger Sub is then in material breach of any of its
covenants or agreements set forth in this Agreement; or

 



 

(ii) if (A) an Adverse Recommendation Change shall have occurred, (B) the
Company shall, within ten (10) Business Days of a tender or exchange offer
relating to securities of the Company having been commenced, fail to publicly
recommend against such tender or exchange offer, (C) the Company shall have

Business Days after the date any Acquisition Proposal or any material
modification thereto is first commenced, publicly announced, distributed or
disseminated to the Companys shareholders upon a written request to do so by
Parent, or (D) the Company shall have willfully and materially breached any of
its obligations set forth in _Section 5.2_ or _Section 5.3(b)_, or (E) the
Company or the Company Board (or any committee thereof) shall have formally
resolved or publicly authorized to take any of the foregoing actions;

 



 

(d) by the Company:

 



 

(i) if Parent or Merger Sub shall have breached or failed to perform any of
its representations, warranties, covenants or agreements set forth in this
Agreement, or if any representation or warranty of Parent or Merger Sub shall
have become untrue, which breach

 



      
 

 



 

or failure to perform or to be true, either individually or in the aggregate,
if occurring or continuing at the Effective Time (A) would result in the
failure of any of the conditions set forth in _Section 6.1_ or _Section 6.3_
and (B) cannot be or has not been cured by the earlier of (1) the Outside Date
and (2) thirty (30) days after the giving of written notice to Parent of such
breach or failure; _provided_ , that the Company shall not have the right to
terminate this Agreement pursuant to this _Section 7.1(d)(i)_ if it is then
in material breach of any of its covenants or agreements set forth in this
Agreement; or

 



 

(ii) at any time prior to obtaining the Company Shareholders Approval, in
order to accept a Superior Proposal in accordance with _Section 5.2(b)_;
_provided_ , that the Company shall have (A) simultaneously with such
termination entered into the associated Alternative Acquisition Agreement, (B)
not willfully breached in any material respect any of the provisions of
_Section 5.2(b)_, and (C) paid any amounts due pursuant to _Section 7.3(b)_.

 



 

The party desiring to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this _Section 7.1_
(other than pursuant to _Section 7.1(a)_) shall give notice of such
termination to the other party.

 



 

Section 7.2 _Effect of Termination_. Any proper and valid termination of this
Agreement pursuant to _Section 7.1_ shall be effective immediately upon the
delivery of written notice by the terminating party to the other party or
parties hereto (or in the case of termination pursuant to _Section 7.1(a)_,
upon delivery of the written consent executed by both Parent and the Company),
as applicable. In the event of the termination of this Agreement pursuant to
_Section 7.1_, this Agreement shall be of no further force or effect without
liability of any party or parties hereto, as applicable (or any director,
officer, employee, affiliate, agent or other representative of such party or
parties) to the other party or parties hereto, as applicable, except (a) for
the terms of this _Section 7.2_, _Section 7.3_ and _Article VIII_, each of
which shall survive the termination of this Agreement, and (b) nothing in this
Agreement shall relieve any party or parties hereto, as applicable, from
liability for any fraud or any material and willful breach of any
representation, warranty, covenant, obligation or other provision of this
Agreement, in which case the non-breaching party shall be entitled to all
rights and remedies available at law or in equity, subject to the provisions
of Section 7.3(c) below. For purposes of this Agreement, "willful breach"
shall mean any intentional act or intentional failure to act by any person and
for the avoidance of doubt with the actual knowledge that the taking of such
act or the failure to take such act would cause a breach of this Agreement. In
addition to the foregoing, no termination of this Agreement shall affect the
obligations of the parties hereto set forth in the Confidentiality Agreement,
all of which obligations shall survive termination of this Agreement in
accordance with their terms.

 



 

Section 7.3 _Fees and Expenses_.

 



 

(a) Except as otherwise provided in this _Section 7.3_, all fees and expenses
incurred in connection with this Agreement, the Merger and the other
transactions contemplated hereby shall be paid by the party incurring such
fees or expenses, whether or not the Merger is consummated.

 



      
 

 



 

(b) In the event that:

 



 

(i) all of the following are met: (A) an Acquisition Proposal (whether or not
conditional) is made directly to the Companys shareholders or is otherwise
publicly disclosed and in each case not withdrawn prior to termination of this
Agreement, (B) this Agreement is terminated by the Company or Parent pursuant
to _Section 7.1(b)(i)_ (i.e., the Merger is not consummated by the Outside
Date) or _Section 7.1(b)(iii)_ (i.e., the Company Shareholders Approval is
not obtained at the Company Shareholders Meeting) or by Parent pursuant to
_Section 7.1(c)(i)_ (i.e., breach of representations, warranties, covenants
or agreements by the Company), and (C) within twelve (12) months after the
date of such termination, the Company enters into an agreement in respect of
any Acquisition Proposal, or recommends and submits an Acquisition Proposal to
its shareholders for adoption, and in each case a transaction in respect of
any Acquisition Proposal is consummated, which, in each case, need not be the
same Acquisition Proposal that was made, disclosed or communicated prior to
termination hereof ( _provided_ , that for purposes of this clause (C), each
reference to "fifteen percent (15%)" in the definition of "Acquisition
Proposal" shall be deemed to be a reference to "50%");

 



 

(ii) this Agreement is terminated by Parent pursuant to _Section 7.1(c)(ii)_;
or

 



 

(iii) this Agreement is terminated by the Company pursuant to _Section
7.1(d)(ii)_ (i.e., the Company accepts a Superior Proposal);

 



 

then, in any such event, the Company shall pay to Parent a fee of $4,500,000
(the " _Company Termination Fee_ "), it being understood that in no event
shall the Company be required to pay the Company Termination Fee on more than
one occasion.

 



 

(c) Payment of the Company Termination Fee shall be made by wire transfer of
same day funds to the accounts designated by Parent (i) concurrently with the
consummation of any transaction contemplated by an Acquisition Proposal, in
the case of a Company Termination Fee payable pursuant to _Section
7.3(b)(i),_ (ii) as promptly as reasonably practicable after termination (and,
in any event, within two Business Days thereof), in the case of termination by
Parent pursuant to _Section 7.1(c)(ii)_, or (iii) simultaneously with, and as
a condition to the effectiveness of, termination, in the case of a termination
by the Company pursuant to _Section 7.1(d)(ii)_. In the event that Parent
shall receive the Company Termination Fee, the receipt of the Company
Termination Fee shall be deemed to be liquidated damages for any and all
losses or damages suffered or incurred by Parent, Merger Sub, any of their
respective Affiliates or any other Person in connection with this Agreement
(and the termination hereof), the transactions contemplated hereby (and the
abandonment thereof) or any matter forming the basis for such termination, and
none of Parent, Merger Sub, any of their respective Affiliates (collectively,
" _Parent Related Parties_ ") or any other Person shall be entitled to bring
or maintain any claim, action or proceeding against the Company or any of its
Affiliates arising out of or in connection with this Agreement, the Merger or
any of the other transactions contemplated herein or any matters forming the
basis for such termination; _provided, however,_ that nothing in this _Section
7.3(c)_ shall limit the rights of Parent or Merger Sub under _Section 8.10_ (
_Specific Performance_ ) or relieve the Company from any liability or damage
resulting from a material and willful breach of any of its representations,
warranties, covenants or agreements set forth in this Agreement or fraud.

 



      
 

 



 

(d) The Company acknowledges that the agreements contained in this _Section
7.3_ are an integral part of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement,
and that, without these agreements, Parent and Merger Sub would not enter into
this Agreement. Accordingly, if the Company fails promptly to pay any amounts
due pursuant to this _Section 7.3_, and, in order to obtain such payment,
Parent commences a suit that results in a judgment against the Company for the
amounts set forth in this _Section 7.3_, the Company shall pay to Parent its
costs and expenses (including reasonable attorneys fees and expenses) in
connection with such suit, together with interest on the amounts due pursuant
to this _Section 7.3_ from the date such payment was required to be made
until the date of payment at the prime lending rate as published in The Wall
Street Journal in effect on the date such payment was required to be made.

 



 

Section 7.4 _Amendment or Supplement_. This Agreement may be amended, modified
or supplemented by the parties by action taken or authorized by their
respective boards of directors at any time prior to the Effective Time,
whether before or after the Company Shareholders Approval has been obtained;
_provided_ , _however_ , that after the Company Shareholders Approval has been
obtained, no amendment shall be made that pursuant to applicable Law requires
further approval or adoption by the shareholders of the Company without such
further approval or adoption. This Agreement may not be amended, modified or
supplemented in any manner, whether by course of conduct or otherwise, except
by an instrument in writing specifically designated as an amendment hereto,
signed on behalf of each of the parties in interest at the time of the
amendment.

 



 

Section 7.5 _Extension of Time; Waiver_. At any time prior to the Effective
Time, the parties (or any of them) may, by action taken or authorized by their
respective boards of directors, to the extent permitted by applicable Law, (a)
extend the time for the performance of any of the obligations or acts of the
other parties, (b) waive any inaccuracies in the representations and
warranties of the other parties set forth in this Agreement or any document
delivered pursuant hereto or (c) subject to applicable Law, waive compliance
with any of the agreements or conditions of the other parties contained
herein; _provided_ , _however_ , that after the Company Shareholders Approval
has been obtained, no waiver may be made that pursuant to applicable Law
requires further approval or adoption by the shareholders of the Company
without such further approval or adoption. Any agreement on the part of a
party to any such waiver shall be valid only if set forth in a written
instrument executed and delivered by a duly authorized officer on behalf of
such party. No failure or delay of any party in exercising any right or remedy
hereunder shall operate as a waiver thereof, nor shall any single or partial
exercise of any such right or power, or any abandonment or discontinuance of
steps to enforce such right or power, or any course of conduct, preclude any
other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right or power.
The rights and remedies of the parties hereunder are cumulative and are not
exclusive of any rights or remedies which they would otherwise have hereunder.

unenforceable in any respect under any applicable Law or rule in any
jurisdiction, such invalidity, illegality or unenforceability shall not affect
any other provision or portion of any provision in such jurisdiction, and this

the Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby are not affected in
any manner materially adverse to any party and such reformation is sufficient
to carry out the overall intentions of the parties as evidenced hereby.

Companys shareholders and holders of In the Money Options (as defined in the

Agreement) the right to receive a contingent cash payment as hereinafter
described; and

 



 

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing and the consummation of the
transactions referred to above, Parent and Rights Agent agree, for the equal
and proportionate benefit of all Holders (as hereinafter defined), as follows:

 



 

 **ARTICLE I**

possession, directly or indirectly, of the power to direct or cause the

and its Affiliates typically devote to product candidates or products owned or
controlled by them of similar potential at a similar stage in their
development or product life, taking into account their safety, tolerability,
efficacy, approved labeling, their proprietary position and profitability
(including pricing and reimbursement status), the competitiveness of

of regulatory approval, and other relevant technical, commercial, legal,
scientific and/or medical factors. For the avoidance of doubt, "Commercially

Reasonable Efforts" does not require Parent to disadvantage any currently
available competing products (including without limitation Remodulin®, Tyvaso®
or Orenitram®) or products currently under development or which may in the

regulatory entity or body, department, commission, board, agency or
instrumentality, university, and any arbitrator, court, tribunal or judicial
body of competent jurisdiction, any stock exchange or similar self-regulatory
organization, in each case whether federal, state, county, provincial and
whether local or foreign.

Register at the applicable time.

 **ARTICLE II**

 



 

 ** _CONTINGENT VALUE RIGHTS_**

 



 

Section 2.1 _CVRs_. The CVRs represent the rights of Holders (granted to the
initial Holders pursuant to the Merger Agreement) to receive a contingent cash
payment pursuant to this Agreement. As provided in the Merger Agreement, each
Holder shall be entitled to one CVR for (i) each Share (as defined in the
Merger Agreement) (other than any Excluded Share (as defined in the Merger
Agreement)) issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (as
defined in the Merger Agreement) that is converted into the right to receive
the Merger Consideration pursuant to the Merger Agreement, (ii) each Share
underlying an In the Money Option that is outstanding and unexercised
immediately prior to the Effective Time that is converted into the right to
receive a cash payment pursuant to _Section 2.2(a)(i)_ of the Merger
Agreement; and (iii) each Share underlying a Restricted Share Unit that is
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time that is converted into the
right to receive a cash payment pursuant to _Section 2.2(a)(iv) _of the
Merger Agreement.

 



 

Section 2.2 _Nontransferable_. The CVRs may not be sold, assigned,
transferred, pledged, encumbered or in any other manner transferred or
disposed of, in whole or in part, other than through a Permitted Transfer. Any
attempted sale, assignment, transfer, pledge, encumbrance or disposition of
CVRs, in whole or in part, in violation of this _Section 2.2_ shall be void
_ab initio_ and of no effect.

 



 

Section 2.3 _No Certificate; Registration; Registration of Transfer; Change of
Address_.

 



 

(a) The CVRs will not be evidenced by a certificate or other instrument.

 



 

(b) The Rights Agent will keep a register (the " _CVR Register_ ") for the
purpose of registering CVRs and Permitted Transfers thereof.

 



 

(c) The CVRs issued in consideration for 102 Company Options or 102 Shares
shall be registered in the name of the 102 Trustee (as defined in the Merger
Agreement) in the CVR Register for the benefit of the applicable beneficial
Holder.

 



      
 

 



 

(d) Subject to the restrictions on transferability set forth in _Section
2.2_, every request made to transfer a CVR must be in writing and accompanied
by a written instrument of transfer in form reasonably satisfactory to the
Rights Agent pursuant to its guidelines, duly executed by the Holder thereof,
the Holders attorney duly authorized in writing, the Holders personal
representative or the Holders survivor, and setting forth in reasonable
detail the circumstances relating to the transfer. Upon receipt of such
written notice, the Rights Agent will, subject to its reasonable determination
that the transfer instrument is in proper form and the transfer otherwise
complies with the other terms and conditions of this Agreement (including the
provisions of _Section 2.2_), register the transfer of the CVRs in the CVR
Register. Parent and the Rights Agent may require payment of a sum sufficient
to cover any stamp or other Tax or governmental charge that is imposed in
connection with any such registration of transfer. The Rights Agent shall have
no duty or obligation to take any action under any section of this Agreement
that requires the payment by a Holder of a CVR of applicable Taxes or charges
unless and until the Rights Agent is reasonably satisfied that all such Taxes
or charges have been paid. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary,
and subject to any other provision in the Withholding Tax Ruling, the Option
Tax Ruling, the Interim Option Tax Ruling, any Valid Tax Certificate (as such
terms are defined in the Merger Agreement) or any other written instructions
provided by the Israel Tax Authority (the "ITA"), no transfer of a CVR under
this Agreement shall be permitted and/or effected, unless Parent and the
Rights Agent are satisfied that any and all Israeli Tax withholding
obligations under Israeli Tax laws, if any, have been met. All duly
transferred CVRs registered in the CVR Register will be the valid obligations
of Parent and will entitle the transferee to the same benefits and rights
under this Agreement as those held immediately prior to the transfer by the
transferor. No transfer of a CVR will be valid until registered in the CVR
Register in accordance with this Agreement. For the avoidance of doubt, the
provisions of Section 2.4(f) below shall be applicable to the Milestone
Payment Amount payable to any Permitted Transferee.

 



 

(e) A Holder may make a written request to the Rights Agent to change such
Holders address of record in the CVR Register. The written request must be
duly executed by the Holder. Upon receipt of such written notice, the Rights
Agent will promptly record the change of address in the CVR Register.

 



 

Section 2.4 _Payment Procedures; Notices_.

 



 

(a) If the Milestone is achieved on or prior to the fifth anniversary of the
Effective Time, then on a date that is within 20 Business Days after such
achievement (the " _Milestone Payment Date_ "), Parent shall deliver to the
Rights Agent (i) written notice indicating that the Milestone has been
achieved (the " _Milestone Notice_ ") and an Officers Certificate certifying
the date of such achievement and that the Holders are entitled to receive the
Milestone Payment (the " _Milestone Achievement Certificate_ "), (ii) any
letter of instruction reasonably required by the Rights Agent and (iii) the
amount of the payment required by _Section 4.2_.

 



 

(b) If the Milestone is not achieved on or prior to the fifth anniversary of
the Effective Time, then on or before the date that is 20 Business Days after
such date, Parent shall deliver to the Rights Agent written notice indicating
that the Milestone was not achieved (the " _Milestone Failure Notice_ ") and
an Officers Certificate certifying the same.

 



      
 

 



 

(c) The Rights Agent will promptly, and in any event within ten (10) Business
Days of receipt of the Milestone Notice as well as any letter of instruction
reasonably required by the Rights Agent, send each Holder at its registered
address a copy of the Milestone Notice and, subject to _Section 2.4(f)_, pay
the applicable Milestone Payment Amount (subject to any Tax required to be
withheld under any Valid Tax Certificate (including, but not limited to, the
Withholding Tax Ruling, the Interim Option Tax Ruling and the Option Tax
Ruling, if obtained), or under applicable Tax law pursuant to _Section
2.4(e)_ or _Section 2.4(f)_) to each of the Holders by check mailed to the
address of each Holder as reflected in the CVR Register as of the close of
business on the date of the Milestone Notice or, in the case of Holders that
are due CVR payments in excess of $100,000 and who have provided the Rights
Agent with wire transfer instructions, by wire transfer of immediately
available funds to such account. Notwithstanding the foregoing, (i) Milestone
Payment Amounts payable pursuant to CVRs issued in consideration for In the
Money Options and Restricted Share Units shall be paid in accordance with
_Section 2.2(a)(i)_ and _Section_ 2.2(a)(iv) of the Merger Agreement,
respectively and (ii) Milestone Payment Amounts payable pursuant to CVRs
issued in consideration for 102 Shares shall be payable by wire transfer to
the 102 Trustee. The Rights Agent will promptly, and in any event within ten
(10) Business Days of receipt of the Milestone Failure Notice, send each
Holder at its registered address a copy of such Milestone Failure Notice.

 



 

(d) Except to the extent any portion of a Milestone Payment is required to be
treated as imputed interest pursuant to applicable tax law, and subject to any
other provision in the Withholding Tax Ruling or any other written
instructions provided by the ITA, the parties hereto intend to treat Milestone
Payments for all Tax purposes as additional consideration for the Shares, In
the Money Company Options and Restricted Share Units pursuant to the Merger
Agreement. Parent and the Company shall report imputed interest on the CVRs as
required by applicable law.

 



 

(e) Subject to _Section 2.4(f)_ below, Parent or its Affiliate shall be
entitled to deduct and withhold, or cause the Rights Agent to deduct and
withhold, from any Milestone Payment Amount or any other amounts otherwise
payable pursuant to this Agreement, such amounts as are required to be
deducted and withheld therefrom under the Withholding Tax Ruling, a Valid Tax
Certificate, the Interim Option Tax Ruling and the Option Tax Ruling, if
obtained, or under any other provision of applicable Tax law (including, for
the avoidance of doubt, the Ordinance and the Code) as reasonably determined
by Parent. Any such withholding may be made, or caused to be made, by Parent
by making payments with respect to Holders who received CVRs in consideration
for In the Money Options and Restricted Share Units through the Companys or
its Affiliates payroll system or any successor payroll system; _provided_ ,
that with respect to 102 Company Options and 102 Shares, payments shall be
made solely to the 102 Trustee. Israeli Tax withholding with respect to
Milestone Payment Amounts with respect to Holders who received CVRs in
consideration for 102 Shares, In the Money Company Options (including for
avoidance of doubt, 102 Company Options) or Restricted Share Units shall be
withheld in accordance with Section 2.4(b) of the Merger Agreement. Prior to
making any such Tax withholdings or causing any such Tax withholdings to be
made with respect to any Holder, other than ordinary course payroll
withholding and reporting on any Milestone Payment Amount, Parent shall
instruct the Rights Agent to solicit IRS Form W-9s or W-8s, or any other
appropriate forms or information, from Holders in order to provide a
reasonable opportunity for the Holder to timely provide any necessary Tax
forms (including an IRS Form W-9 or an applicable IRS Form W-8) in order to
avoid or reduce such withholding, and such Milestone Payment may be reasonably
delayed in

 



      
 

 



 

order to gather such necessary Tax forms. Parent, its Affiliates and the
Rights Agent may assume all such forms in its possession or provided by any
Holder are valid under applicable law until subsequently notified by such
Holder. Parent or its Affiliate shall, or shall cause the Rights Agent to,
take all action that may be necessary to ensure that any amounts withheld in
respect of Taxes are promptly remitted to the appropriate Governmental Entity.
To the extent any amounts are so deducted and withheld and properly remitted
to the appropriate Governmental Entity, such amounts shall be treated for all
purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the person in respect of
whom such deduction and withholding was made, and as required by applicable
law, Parent shall, in a timely manner, deliver (or shall cause the Rights
Agent to deliver) to the person to whom such amounts would otherwise have been
paid an original IRS Form 1099 or other reasonably acceptable documents
evidencing of such withholding.

 



 

(f) Notwithstanding the provisions of _Section 2.4(e)_ above, and subject to
any other provision to the contrary in the Withholding Tax Ruling, with
respect to Israeli Taxes, any Milestone Payment Amount payable to a Holder
(other than Milestone Payment Amounts payable with respect to CVRs issued in
consideration for Company Options, Restricted Share Units or 102 Shares) shall
be retained by the Rights Agent (or a Person acting on its behalf) for the
benefit of each such Holder for a period of one hundred and eighty (180) days
from the Milestone Payment Date or an earlier date required in writing by such
Holder or by the ITA, (the " _CVR Withholding Drop Date_ ") (during which time
no payments to such Holder shall be made and no amounts for Israeli Taxes
shall be withheld from the payments deliverable pursuant to this Agreement,
except as provided below and during which time each Holder may obtain a Valid
Tax Certificate). If any such Holder delivers, no later than three Business
Days prior to the CVR Withholding Drop Date, a Valid Tax Certificate to Parent
and the Rights Agent, then the deduction and withholding of any Israeli Taxes,
if any, shall be made only in accordance with the provisions of such Valid Tax
Certificate and the balance of the payment that is not withheld shall be paid
to such Holder, subject to any non-Israeli withholding which is applicable to
the payment (if any). If any such Holder (i) does not provide the Parent and
the Rights Agent with a Valid Tax Certificate by no later than three Business
Days before the CVR Withholding Drop Date, or (ii) submits a written request
to release his portion of the consideration prior to the CVR Withholding Drop
Date and fails to submit a Valid Tax Certificate at or before such time, then
the amount to be withheld from such Holders portion of the consideration
shall be calculated according to the applicable withholding rate as prescribed
under applicable Tax law, as reasonably determined by Parent, which amount
shall be increased by the interest plus linkage differences as defined in
Section 159A of the Ordinance (as defined in the Merger Agreement) for the
time period between the fifteenth (15th) calendar day of the month following
the month during which the Closing (as defined in the Merger Agreement) occurs
and the time the relevant payment is made. Any withholding made in New Israeli
Shekels with respect to payments made hereunder in dollars shall be calculated
based on US dollars to NIS exchange rate at the time the relevant payment is
made (but in any event not lower than the US dollars to NIS exchange rate on
the Closing Date (as defined in the Merger Agreement)) and any currency
conversion commissions will be borne by the applicable payment recipient and
deducted from payments to be made to such payment recipient.

 



 

(g) Any portion of any Milestone Payment Amount that remains undistributed to
a Holder six (6) months after the date of the delivery of the Milestone Notice
will be delivered by the Rights Agent to Parent, upon demand, and any Holder
will thereafter look only to Parent for payment of

 



      
 

 



 

such Milestone Payment Amount, without interest, but such Holder will have no
greater rights against Parent than those accorded to general unsecured
creditors of Parent under applicable law.

 



 

(h) Neither Parent nor the Rights Agent will be liable to any person in
respect of any Milestone Payment Amount delivered to a public official
pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar law. If,
despite Parents and/or the Rights Agents commercially reasonable efforts to
deliver a Milestone Payment Amount to the applicable Holder, such Milestone
Payment Amount has not been paid prior to two years after the applicable
Milestone Payment Date (or immediately prior to such earlier date on which
such Milestone Payment Amount would otherwise escheat to or become the
property of any Governmental Entity), any such Milestone Payment Amount will,
to the extent permitted by applicable law, become the property of Parent, free
and clear of all claims or interest of any person previously entitled thereto.
In addition to and not in limitation of any other indemnity obligation herein,
Parent agrees to indemnify and hold harmless Rights Agent with respect to any
liability, penalty, cost or expense Rights Agent may incur or be subject to in
connection with transferring such property to Parent.

 



 

(i) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, in accordance
with _Section 2.2(a)(iii)_ of the Merger Agreement, if (i) the Milestone
Payment Date occurs following the fifth anniversary of the change in ownership
or effective control of the Company for the purposes of Treas. Reg. Section
1.409A-3(i)(5) and (ii) receipt of a Post 5th Anniversary Payment by one or
more Section 2.2(a)(i) Option Holders will result in such Section 2.2(a)(i)
Option Holders being subject to taxation under Section 409A of the Code with
respect to the cash payment made to such Section 2.2(a)(i) Option Holders
pursuant to _Section 2.2(a)(i)(A)_ of the Merger Agreement, as applicable,
(A) the Post 5th Anniversary Payment shall not be paid to such Section
2.2(a)(i) Option Holders and (B) the Post 5th Anniversary Payment shall
instead be paid pro rata to Holders other than such Section 2.2(a)(i) Option
Holders.

 



 

Section 2.5 _No Voting, Dividends or Interest; No Equity or Ownership Interest
in Parent_.

 



 

(a) The CVRs will not have any voting or dividend rights, and interest will
not accrue on any amounts payable on the CVRs to any Holder.

 



 

(b) The CVRs will not represent any equity or ownership interest in Parent,
any constituent company to the Merger or any of their respective Affiliates.

 



 

Section 2.6 _Ability to Abandon CVR_. A Holder may at any time, at such
Holders option, abandon all of such Holders remaining rights in a CVR by
transferring such CVR to Parent or any of its Affiliates without consideration
therefor. Nothing in this Agreement shall prohibit Parent or any of its
Affiliates from offering to acquire or acquiring any CVRs for consideration
from the Holders, in private transactions or otherwise, in its sole
discretion. Any CVRs acquired by Parent or any of its Affiliates shall be
automatically deemed extinguished and no longer outstanding for purposes of
the definition of Acting Holders and _Article V_.

Section 3.1 _Certain Duties and Responsibilities_. The Rights Agent will not

signed or presented by the proper party or parties;

 



 

(b) whenever the Rights Agent will deem it desirable that a matter be proved
or established prior to taking, suffering or omitting any action hereunder,
the Rights Agent may rely upon an Officers Certificate, which certificate
shall be full authorization and protection to the Rights Agent, and the Rights
Agent shall, in the absence of bad faith, gross negligence or willful
misconduct on its part, incur no liability and be held harmless by Parent for
or in respect of any action taken, suffered or omitted to be taken by it under
the provisions of this Agreement in reliance upon such certificate;

 



 

(c) the Rights Agent may engage and consult with counsel of its selection and

(d) the permissive rights of the Rights Agent to do things enumerated in this
Agreement will not be construed as a duty;

premises;

 



 

(f) the Rights Agent shall not be liable for or by reason of, and shall be

recitals contained in this Agreement or be required to verify the same, but
all such statements and recitals are and shall be deemed to have been made by
Parent only;

 



 

(g) the Rights Agent will have no liability and shall be held harmless by
Parent in respect of the validity of this Agreement or the execution and
delivery hereof (except the due execution and delivery hereof by the Rights
Agent and the enforceability of this Agreement against the Rights Agent
assuming the due execution and delivery hereof by Parent); nor shall it be
responsible for any breach by Parent of any covenant or condition contained in
this Agreement;

 



 

(h) Parent agrees to indemnify Rights Agent for, and hold Rights Agent
harmless against, any loss, liability, claim, demands, suits or expense
arising out of or in connection with Rights Agents duties under this
Agreement, including the reasonable costs and expenses of defending Rights
Agent against any claims, charges, demands, suits or loss, unless such loss
(i) has been

 



      
 

 



 

determined by a court of competent jurisdiction to be a result of Rights
Agents gross negligence, bad faith or willful or intentional misconduct; or
(ii) is a result of the Rights Agent not adhering to the provisions of the
Withholding Tax Ruling, written instructions provided by the ITA or otherwise
with respect to any Tax withholding made or not made by the Rights Agent (or
anyone on its behalf);

 



 

(i) Parent agrees (i) to pay the fees and expenses of the Rights Agent in

and Parent on or prior to the date hereof and (ii) to reimburse the Rights

expenses paid or incurred by it in connection with the administration by the
Rights Agent of its duties hereunder;

 



 

(j) no provision of this Agreement shall require the Rights Agent to expend or
risk its own funds or otherwise incur any financial liability in the
performance of any of its duties hereunder or in the exercise of its rights if
there shall be reasonable grounds for believing that repayment of such funds
or adequate indemnification against such risk or liability is not reasonably
assured to it;

 



 

(l) the Rights Agent shall not be deemed to have knowledge of any event of
which it was supposed to receive notice thereof hereunder, and the Rights
Agent shall be fully protected and shall incur no liability for failing to
take action in connection therewith, unless and until it has received such
notice in writing;

 



 

(m) the Rights Agent and any shareholder, affiliate, director, officer or
employee of the Rights Agent may buy, sell or deal in any securities of Parent
or the Surviving Corporation (as defined in the Merger Agreement) or become

Section 3.3 _Resignation and Removal; Appointment of Successor_.

 



 

(a) Rights Agent may resign at any time by giving written notice thereof to
Parent specifying a date when such resignation will take effect, which notice
will be sent at least sixty (60) days prior to the date so specified but in no
event will such resignation become effective until a successor Rights Agent
has been appointed. Parent has the right to remove Rights Agent at any time by
specifying a date when such removal will take effect but no such removal will
become effective until a successor Rights Agent has been appointed. Notice of
such removal will be given by Parent to Rights Agent, which notice will be
sent at least sixty (60) days prior to the date so specified.

 



 

(b) If the Rights Agent provides notice of its intent to resign, is removed
pursuant to _Section 3.3(a)_ or becomes incapable of acting, subject to the
provisions of the Withholding Tax Ruling and the need to obtain the consent of
the ITA, Parent will as soon as is reasonably possible appoint a qualified
successor Rights Agent. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if Parent shall fail to
make such appointment within a period of 60 days after giving notice of such
removal or after it has been notified in writing of such resignation or
incapacity by the resigning or incapacitated Rights Agent, then the incumbent
Rights Agent may apply to any court of competent jurisdiction for the
appointment of a new Rights Agent. The successor Rights Agent so appointed
will, forthwith upon its acceptance of such appointment in accordance with
_Section 3.4_, become the successor Rights Agent.

 



 

(c) Parent will give notice of each resignation and each removal of a Rights
Agent and each appointment of a successor Rights Agent by mailing written
notice of such event by first-class mail to the Holders as their names and
addresses appear in the CVR Register. Each notice will include the name and
address of the successor Rights Agent. If Parent fails to send such notice
within ten (10) days after acceptance of appointment by a successor Rights
Agent in accordance with _Section 3.4_, the successor Rights Agent will cause
the notice to be mailed at the expense of Parent.

Agent appointed pursuant to _Section 3.3(b)_ hereunder will execute,
acknowledge and deliver to Parent and to the retiring Rights Agent an
instrument accepting such appointment and a counterpart of this Agreement, and
thereupon such successor Rights Agent, without any further act, deed or
conveyance, will become vested with all the rights, powers, trusts and duties
of the retiring Rights Agent. On request of Parent or the successor Rights
Agent, the retiring Rights Agent will execute and deliver an instrument
transferring to the successor Rights Agent all the rights, powers and trusts

 **ARTICLE IV**

 



 

 ** _COVENANTS_**

 



 

Section 4.1 _List of Holders_. Parent will furnish or cause to be furnished to
the Rights Agent in such form as Parent receives from the Companys transfer
agent (or other agent performing similar services for the Company), the names
and addresses of the Holders within thirty (30) Business Days of the Effective
Time. The CVRs shall, in the case of the holders of Shares, be

 



      
 

 



 

registered in the names and addresses of the holder as set forth in the
applicable letter of transmittal accompanying the Shares surrendered by the
holder thereof in connection with the Merger pursuant to the Merger Agreement
and in a denomination equal to the number of Shares so surrendered, and in the
case of In the Money Options and Restricted Share Units, be registered in the
name and address of the holder set forth in the books and records of the
Company at the Effective Time and in a denomination computed in accordance
with the terms of the Merger Agreement.

 



 

Section 4.2 _Payment of Milestone Payment Amounts_. If the Milestone has been
achieved in accordance with this Agreement, Parent will, promptly following
the delivery of the Milestone Notice to the Rights Agent, (a) deposit with the
Rights Agent, for payment to the Holders of CVRs issued in consideration for
Shares in accordance with _Section 2.4_, the aggregate amount necessary to
pay the Milestone Payment Amount to each such Holder and (b) pay, or cause to
be paid, the Milestone Payment Amounts payable pursuant to CVRs issued in
consideration for In the Money Options and Restricted Share Units in
accordance with _Section 2.2(a)(i)_ and _Section 2.2(a)(iv)_, as the case
may be, of the Merger Agreement. For the avoidance of doubt, the Milestone
Payment Amounts shall be paid only one time, in respect of the first
achievement (if any) of Milestone.

 



 

Section 4.3 _Efforts_. Commencing upon the Closing, Parent shall use, and
shall cause each applicable other Selling Entity to use, Commercially
Reasonable Efforts to achieve the Milestone. Without limiting the foregoing,
neither Parent nor any of its Affiliates shall act in bad faith for the
purpose of avoiding achievement of the Milestone or the payment of the
Milestone Payment Amounts.

 



 

Section 4.4 _Tax Reporting_. The Rights Agent shall comply with all applicable
Laws (as defined in the Merger Agreement) and shall comply with the provisions
set forth in the Withholding Tax Ruling, a Valid Tax Certificate and any other
written instructions provided by the ITA, including as the foregoing relate to
Tax reporting and withholding with respect to the Milestone Payments made
pursuant to this Agreement, other than any payroll reporting requirements with
respect to the Milestone Payment made under _Section 2.4._

 



 

Section 4.5. _Further Assurances_. Parent agrees that it will perform,
execute, acknowledge and deliver or cause to be performed, executed,
acknowledged and delivered, all such further and other acts, instruments and
assurances as may reasonably be required by the Rights Agent for the carrying
out or performing by the Rights Agent of the provisions of this Agreement.

 



 

Section 4.6. _Reports_. Within 30 days after receipt of the first FDA Approval
for the Product, Parent shall provide written notice thereof to the Rights
Agent. Following receipt of the first FDA Approval for the Product and until
delivery of notice of achievement of the Milestone to the Rights Agent, Parent
shall provide to the Rights Agent, on a semi-annual basis as described below,
a written report, certified as true and correct by an officer of Parent,
setting forth the number of Initial Treatment Visits performed during such
half-year, as reported to Parent and other Selling Entities by or on behalf of
specialty pharmacies, hub providers and/or other service providers in the
chain of distribution for the Product in the United States (each, an " _Update
Report_ "), which report shall be accompanied by true and complete copies of
reports delivered by or on behalf of such specialty pharmacies, hub providers
and/or other service providers to Parent

 



      
 

 



 

or any other Selling Entity; _provided_ , that Parent shall not be required to
disclose in any Update Report any personally identifiable information or
Protected Health Information (as defined in the Health Insurance Portability
and Accountability Act of 1996) with respect to any specific patient. All
information contained in any Update Report shall be subject to _Section 4.8_
of this Agreement. Update Reports shall be provided to the Rights Agent as
follows: (a) an Update Report covering the first half of a calendar year shall
be provided within thirty days of the date Parent files a Quarterly Report on
Form 10-Q with the Securities and Exchange Commission for the quarter ending
June 30 of such calendar year and (b) an Update Report covering the second
half of a calendar year shall be provided within thirty days of the date
Parent files an Annual Report on Form 10-K with the Securities and Exchange
Commission for such calendar year.

 



 

Section 4.7. _Audits_.

 



 

(a) Upon the written request of the Acting Holders provided to Parent not less
than thirty (30) days in advance (such request not to be made prior to receipt
of FDA Approval of the Product or more than once in any twelve (12) month
period), Parent shall permit, and shall cause its controlled Affiliates to
permit, an independent certified public accounting firm of nationally
recognized standing designated in writing either (i) jointly by the Acting
Holders and Parent, or (ii) if such parties fail to make a designation,
jointly by an independent public accounting firm selected by Parent and an
independent public accounting firm selected by the Acting Holders, (the "
_Independent Accountant_ ") to have access during normal business hours to
such of the records of Parent, the Company, the Surviving Company or such
other Affiliates of Parent as may be reasonably necessary to verify the
accuracy of the statements set forth in the Update Reports and to determine
whether and when the Milestone has been achieved (an " _Audit_ "). Parent
shall, and shall cause its controlled Affiliates to, furnish to the
Independent Accountant such access, work papers and other documents and
information reasonably necessary for the Independent Accountants evaluation
of the occurrence of the Milestone; _provided_ , that Parent may, and may
cause its controlled Affiliates to, redact documents and information not
relevant for such evaluation. The Independent Accountant shall disclose to
Parent and the Acting Holders any matters directly related to its findings and
shall disclose whether it has determined that any statements set forth in any
Update Report are incorrect.

 



 

(b) If the Independent Accountant concludes that the Milestone was achieved,
Parent shall pay to the Rights Agent (for further distribution to the Holders)
or to each Holder as set forth in _Article 2_, the applicable Milestone
Payment Amount, plus interest on such Milestone Payment Amount at the "prime
rate" as published in the Wall Street Journal or similar reputable data source
from time to time calculated from when the Milestone Payment Amount should
have been paid (if Parent had given notice of achievement of the Milestone
following its actual achievement, as determined by the Independent Accountant,
at the time required pursuant to the terms of this Agreement), as applicable,
to the date of actual payment. The decision of the Independent Accountant
shall be final, conclusive and binding on Parent and the Holders, shall be
non-appealable and shall not be subject to further review. The fees charged by
the Independent Accountant shall be paid by the Acting Holders; _provided_ ,
however, that if the Independent Accountant concludes that the Milestone was
achieved and the Milestone Payment Amounts properly due were not paid to the
Holders, the fees charged by such Independent Accountant shall be paid by
Parent.

 



      
 

 



 

(c) Each Person seeking to receive information from Parent in connection with
a review pursuant to this _Section 4.7_ shall enter into a confidentiality
agreement with Parent and/or its applicable controlled Affiliate satisfactory
to Parent obligating such party to retain all such information disclosed to
such party in confidence pursuant to such confidentiality agreement.

 



 

Section 4.8 _Confidentiality_. The Rights Agent agrees with Parent that during
the term of this Agreement and for three (3) years after the Termination Date,
the Rights Agent will not disclose any of the information contained in the
Update Reports (the " _Confidential Information_ ") to any other Person and
shall use the Confidential Information only as required in connection with the
performance of its obligations under this Agreement and the enforcement of its
rights under this Agreement; _provided_ , that the Confidential Information
will not include any information that is or becomes generally available to the
public other than as a result (directly or indirectly) of the breach of this
_Section 4.8_ by the Rights Agent or its attorneys or agents; _provided,
further,_ that nothing in this _Section 4.8_ will restrict the Rights Agent
from (i) using Confidential Information, or disclosing Confidential
Information to any Holder, to the extent reasonably necessary in connection
with enforcing the Rights Agents rights or the Holders rights, or defending
any claims against the Rights Agent or any Holder, arising from, pertaining to
or relating to the Merger Agreement, this Agreement, any letter of transmittal
delivered by or on behalf of Parent (including by the Paying Agent) pursuant
to _Section 2.3(c)_ of the Merger Agreement, or any certificate or document
delivered pursuant to any of the foregoing, (ii) disclosing Confidential
Information if required by any court order or applicable law so long as the
Rights Agent, to the extent permitted by law, provides Parent with prompt
notice of such requirements prior to making any disclosure so that Parent may
seek an appropriate protective order, _provided_ , that the Rights Agent shall
disclose only that portion of the Confidential Information that the Rights
Agents counsel advises is legally required to be disclosed and, if requested
by Parent, the Rights Agent shall cooperate with Parent, at Parents expense,
to obtain an appropriate protective order or other reliable assurance that
confidential treatment will be accorded the Confidential Information disclosed
by the Rights Agent or (iii) disclosing Confidential Information to the Rights
Agents attorneys or agents, on a need to know basis, _provided_ that such
agents shall have agreed in advance of such disclosure to be bound by
confidentiality obligations no less restrictive than those set forth in this
_Section 4.8_.

Section 6.2 _Notice to Holders_. Where this Agreement provides for notice to
Holders, such notice will be sufficiently given (unless otherwise herein
expressly provided) if in writing and mailed, first-class postage prepaid, to
each Holder affected by such event, at the Holders address as it appears in
the CVR Register, not later than the latest date, and not earlier than the
earliest date, if any, prescribed for the giving of such notice. In any case
where notice to Holders is given by mail, neither the failure to mail such
notice, nor any defect in any notice so mailed, to any particular Holder will
affect the sufficiency of such notice with respect to other Holders. Where
this Agreement provides for notice in any manner, such notice may be waived in
writing by the Person entitled to receive such notice, either before or after
the event, and such waiver shall be the equivalent of such notice. Waivers of
notice by Holders shall be filed with the Rights Agent, but such filing shall
not be a condition precedent to the validity of any action taken in reliance
upon such waiver. In case it shall be impracticable to mail notice to the
Holders of any event as

 



      
 

 



 

required by any provision of this Agreement, then any method of giving such

sufficient giving of such notice.

 



 

Section 6.3 _Successors and Assigns_.

 



 

(a) This Agreement will be binding upon, inure to the benefit of and be
enforceable by Parents successors and assigns, and this Agreement shall not
restrict Parents, any assignees or any of their respective successors

of its assets to any Person or otherwise directly or indirectly transfer or
convey the Product to any Person. Either (i) each of Parents successors,
assigns or transferees of all or substantially all of Parents assets or the
Product shall expressly assume by an instrument, supplemental hereto, executed
and delivered to the Rights Agent, the due and punctual payment of the
Milestone Payment and the due and punctual performance and observance of all
of the covenants and obligations of this Agreement to be performed or observed
by Parent or (ii) Parent shall agree to remain subject to its obligations
hereunder, including payment of the Milestone Payment.

 



 

(b) Any Parent successor or assignee permitted hereunder may thereafter assign
any or all of its rights, interests and obligations hereunder in the same
manner as Parent pursuant to this _Section 6.3_.

 



 

(c) The Rights Agent may not assign this Agreement without Parents written
consent. Any attempted assignment of this Agreement or any such rights in
violation of this _Section 6.3_ shall be void and of no effect.

 



 

Section 6.4 _Benefits of Agreement_. Nothing in this Agreement, express or
implied, is intended to or shall confer upon any Person other than the parties
and their respective successors and permitted assigns any legal or equitable
right, benefit or remedy of any nature under or by reason of this Agreement.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Holders and the Holders successors and
assigns pursuant to a Permitted Transfer are intended third-party
beneficiaries of this Agreement. The rights of Holders and their successors
and assigns pursuant to Permitted Transfers are limited to those expressly
provided in this Agreement. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained
herein, any Holder or Holders successor or assign pursuant to a Permitted
Transfer may agree to renounce, in whole or in part, its rights under this
Agreement by written notice to the Rights Agent and Parent, which notice, if
given, shall be irrevocable.

of Delaware, without regard to the laws of any other jurisdiction that might
be applied because of the conflicts of laws principles of the State of

(b) Each of the parties irrevocably agrees that any legal action or proceeding
arising out of or relating to this Agreement brought by any party or its
Affiliates against any other party or its Affiliates shall be brought and
determined in the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware, _provided_ ,
that if jurisdiction is not then available in the Court of Chancery of the
State of Delaware, then any such legal action or proceeding may be brought in
any federal court located

 



      
 

 



 

in the State of Delaware or any other Delaware state court. Each of the
parties hereby irrevocably submits to the jurisdiction of the aforesaid courts
for itself and with respect to its property, generally and unconditionally,

competent jurisdiction to enforce any judgment, decree or award rendered by
any such court in Delaware as described herein. Each of the parties further
agrees that notice as provided herein shall constitute sufficient service of
process and the parties further waive any argument that such service is
insufficient. Each of the parties hereby irrevocably and unconditionally
waives, and agrees not to assert, by way of motion or as a defense,
counterclaim or otherwise, in any action or proceeding arising out of or
relating to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby, (i) any
claim that it is not personally subject to the jurisdiction of the courts in
Delaware as described herein for any reason, (ii) that it or its property is
exempt or immune from jurisdiction of any such court or from any legal process

Section 6.6 _Severability_. Whenever possible, each provision or portion of
any provision of this Agreement shall be interpreted in such manner as to be
effective and valid under applicable law, but if any provision or portion of
any provision of this Agreement is held to be invalid, illegal or
unenforceable in any respect under any applicable law or rule in any
jurisdiction, such invalidity, illegality or unenforceability shall not affect
any other provision or portion of any provision in such jurisdiction, and this
Agreement shall be reformed, construed and enforced in such jurisdiction as if
such invalid, illegal or unenforceable provision or portion of any provision
had never been contained herein so long as the economic or legal substance of
the transactions contemplated hereby are not affected in any manner materially
adverse to any party.

 



 

Section 6.7 _Counterparts and Signature_. This Agreement may be executed in
two or more counterparts, all of which shall be considered one and the same
instrument and shall become effective when one or more counterparts have been
signed by each of the parties and delivered to the other party.

force or effect, and the parties hereto shall have no liability hereunder, at

Date, this Agreement shall not terminate until such Milestone Payment Amounts
have been paid in full in accordance with the terms of this Agreement;
_provided further,_ that no

 



      
 

 



 

termination of this Agreement shall be deemed to affect the rights of the
parties to bring suit in the case of a material breach occurring prior to such
Termination Date.

 



 

Section 6.9 _Entire Agreement_. This Agreement and the Merger Agreement
constitute the entire agreement, and supersede all prior written agreements,
arrangements, communications and understandings and all prior and
contemporaneous oral agreements, arrangements, communications and
understandings among the parties with respect to the subject matter hereof and
