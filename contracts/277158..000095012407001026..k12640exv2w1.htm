 AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF SHARE EXCHANGE (this " _Agreement_ ") dated as of February 22, 2007, among Cap Rock Holding Corporation, a Delaware corporation (" _Cap Rock Holding_ "), Semco Holding Corporation, a Delaware corporation (" _Parent_ "), and SEMCO Energy, Inc., a Michigan corporation (the " _Company_ "). 

  

 WHEREAS the Board of Directors of the Company (the " _Company Board_ ") has adopted resolutions that approve the plan of share exchange set forth in this Agreement, whereby (i) each issued and outstanding share of common stock, par value $1 per share, of the Company (the " _Company Common Stock_ ") shall be transferred to Parent in exchange for the right to receive $8.15 in cash per share (the " _Common Stock Exchange Price_ "), and (ii) each issued and outstanding share of 5.00% Series B Convertible Cumulative Preferred Stock, par value $1 per share, of the Company (the " _Series B Preferred Stock_") shall be transferred to Parent in exchange for the right to receive the Preferred Stock Exchange Price (as defined in Section 9.03), in each case on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement (collectively, the " _Exchange_ "); 

   

 WHEREAS the Company Board has adopted resolutions that recommend that this Agreement and the Exchange be approved by the holders of the Company Common Stock; 

   

 WHEREAS Cap Rock Holding holds all the outstanding capital stock of Parent and Cap Rock Energy Corporation, a Texas corporation and a regulated public utility; and 

   

 WHEREAS Cap Rock Holding, Parent and the Company desire to make certain representations, warranties, covenants and agreements in connection with, and also to prescribe various conditions to, the Exchange. 

   

 NOW, THEREFORE, the parties hereto agree as follows: 

   

ARTICLE I 

   

 _The Exchange_   

  

 SECTION 1.01. _The Exchange._ On the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement, and in accordance with the Business Corporation Act of the State of Michigan (the " _BCA_ "), at the Effective Time (as defined in Section 1.03), (i) Parent and the Company shall effect the Exchange and (ii) the Company shall become a wholly owned subsidiary of Parent. 

   

 SECTION 1.02. _Closing._ The closing (the " _Closing_ ") of the Exchange shall take place at the offices of Cravath, Swaine and Moore LLP, 825 Eighth Avenue, New York, New York 10019 at 10:00 a.m. on the second business day following the  ##### 

 

  

2      

satisfaction (or, to the extent permitted by Law (as defined in Section 3.06),
waiver by all parties) of the conditions set forth in Section 7.01, or, if on
such day any condition set forth in Section 7.02 or 7.03 has not been
satisfied (or, to the extent permitted by Law, waived by the party or parties
entitled to the benefits thereof), as soon as practicable after all the
conditions set forth in Article VII have been satisfied (or, to the extent
permitted by Law, waived by the parties entitled to the benefits thereof), or
at such other place, time and date as shall be agreed in writing between
Parent and the Company. The date on which the Closing occurs is referred to
in this Agreement as the " _Closing Date_ ". 

   

 SECTION 1.03. _Effective Time._ Prior to the Closing, Parent and the Company shall prepare, and on the Closing Date or as soon as practicable thereafter the Company shall file with the Department of Labor and Economic Growth of the State of Michigan, a certificate of share exchange (the " _Certificate of Exchange_ ") executed in accordance with Section 707 of the BCA and shall prepare and make all other filings or recordings required under the BCA, including any filing appropriate under Section 707 of the BCA. The Exchange shall become effective at such time as such Department of Labor and Economic Growth endorses the Certificate of Exchange, as set forth in Section 131 of the BCA, or at such other time as Parent and the Company shall agree and as shall be applicable in accordance with Section 131 of the BCA (the time the Exchange becomes effective being the " _Effective Time_ "). 

   

 SECTION 1.04. _Effects._ The Exchange shall have the effects set forth in Section 724(2) of the BCA and this Agreement. 

   

ARTICLE II 

   

 _Effect on the Capital Stock of the Company; Exchange of Certificates_   

  

 SECTION 2.01. _Effect on Capital Stock._ At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Exchange and without any action on the part of the holder of any shares of Company Common Stock or Series B Preferred Stock: 

   

 (a) _Exchange of Company Common Stock and Series B Preferred Stock._ (1) At the Effective Time (i) each issued and outstanding share of Company Common Stock (other than any such shares owned by Parent) shall be transferred by operation of Law to Parent in exchange for the right to receive the Common Stock Exchange Price, and (ii) each issued and outstanding share of Series B Preferred Stock (other than any such shares owned by Parent) shall be transferred by operation of Law to Parent in exchange for the right to receive the Preferred Stock Exchange Price. 

   

 (2) The cash payable upon the transfer of shares of Company Common Stock and Series B Preferred Stock pursuant to this Section 2.01(a) is referred to collectively as the " _Exchange Consideration_ ". As of the Effective Time, each holder of a certificate representing any such shares of Company Common Stock or Series B Preferred Stock shall cease to have any rights with respect thereto except the right to receive the Exchange Consideration upon surrender of such certificate in accordance with Section 2.02, without interest. Each owner of a beneficial interest in any such share of  ##### 

 

 

3    

Company Common Stock or Series B Preferred Stock shall cease to have any
rights against the Company with respect to such share of Company Common Stock
or Series B Preferred Stock, as the case may be. 

   

 (b) _Parent Shares._ Immediately following the Effective Time, the Company shall issue to Parent (i) a certificate evidencing all issued and outstanding shares of Company Common Stock (other than any such shares owned at the Effective Time by Parent), and (ii) a certificate evidencing all issued and outstanding shares of Series B Preferred Stock (other than any such shares owned at the Effective Time by Parent). 

   

 SECTION 2.02. _Exchange of Certificates._ (a) _Paying Agent._ Prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall select a bank or trust company that is reasonably acceptable to the Company to act as paying agent (the " _Paying Agent_ ") for the payment of the Exchange Consideration upon surrender of certificates representing Company Common Stock and certificates representing Series B Preferred Stock. Cap Rock Holding agrees to cause Parent to provide, and Parent shall provide, to the Paying Agent at or as soon as practicable after the Effective Time all cash necessary to pay the Exchange Consideration pursuant to Section 2.01(a) (such cash being hereinafter referred to as the " _Exchange Fund_ "). 

   

 (b) _Exchange Procedure._ As soon as reasonably practicable after the Effective Time, the Paying Agent shall mail to each holder of record of a certificate or certificates that immediately prior to the Effective Time represented outstanding shares of Company Common Stock or Series B Preferred Stock whose shares were transferred to Parent for the Exchange Consideration pursuant to Section 2.01(a) (the " _Certificates_ "), (i) a letter of transmittal (which shall specify that delivery of the Exchange Consideration shall be effected only upon delivery of the Certificates to the Paying Agent and shall be in such form and have such other provisions as Parent may reasonably specify) and (ii) instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the Certificates in exchange for Exchange Consideration. Upon surrender of a Certificate to the Paying Agent, together with such letter of transmittal, duly executed, and such other documents as may reasonably be required by the Paying Agent, the holder of such Certificate shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor the amount of cash for which the shares of Company Common Stock or Series B Preferred Stock, as the case may be, theretofore represented by such Certificate were transferred pursuant to Section 2.01(a), and the Certificate so surrendered shall forthwith be canceled. In the event of a transfer of ownership of Company Common Stock or Series B Preferred Stock prior to the Effective Time that is not registered in the transfer records of the Company, payment may be made to a person other than the person in whose name the Certificate so surrendered is registered, if such Certificate shall be properly endorsed or otherwise be in proper form for transfer and the person requesting such payment shall pay any transfer or other taxes required by reason of the payment to a person other than the registered holder of such Certificate or establish to the satisfaction of Parent that such tax has been paid or is not applicable. Until surrendered as contemplated by this Section 2.02, each Certificate shall be deemed at any time after the Effective Time to represent only the right to receive upon such surrender the amount of cash, without interest, for which the shares of Company  ##### 

 

 

4 

  

Common Stock or Series B Preferred Stock, as the case may be, theretofore
represented by such Certificate have been transferred pursuant to Section
2.01(a). No interest shall be paid or accrue on the cash payable upon
surrender of any Certificate. If any Certificate has been lost, stolen or
destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the person in
whose name the Certificate is registered on the Companys books, and, if
required by Parent, the posting by such person of a bond in such reasonable
amount as Parent may direct as indemnity against any claim that may be
made against it with respect to such Certificate, Parent shall cause the
Paying Agent to issue in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed
Certificate the Exchange Consideration deliverable in respect thereof
pursuant to this Agreement. 

   

 (c) _No Further Ownership Rights._ The Exchange Consideration paid in accordance with the terms of this Article II upon the transfer of any shares of Company Common Stock or any shares of Series B Preferred Stock shall be deemed to have been paid in full satisfaction of all rights of the former legal and beneficial holders thereof pertaining to such shares of Company Common Stock or Series B Preferred Stock, as the case may be, _subject_ , _however_ , to the Companys obligation to pay any dividends or make any other distributions with a record date prior to the Effective Time that may have been declared or made by the Company on such shares in accordance with the terms of this Agreement or prior to the date of this Agreement and which remain unpaid at the Effective Time, and after the Effective Time there shall be no registration of transfers on the stock transfer books of the Company of the right to the Exchange Consideration represented by the Certificates. If, after the Effective Time, any Certificates are presented to the Company or the Paying Agent for any reason, they shall be canceled and exchanged as provided in this Article II. 

   

 (d) _Termination of Exchange Fund._ Any portion of the Exchange Fund that remains undistributed to the holders of Company Common Stock and Series B Preferred Stock for nine months after the Effective Time, together with any gains thereon, may be delivered to Parent, upon demand, and any holder of Certificates who has not theretofore complied with this Article II shall thereafter look only to Parent for payment of its claim for Exchange Consideration. 

   

 (e) _No Liability._ None of Parent, the Company or the Paying Agent shall be liable to any person in respect of any cash from the Exchange Fund delivered to a public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar Law. If any Certificate has not been surrendered prior to such date on which Exchange Consideration in respect of such Certificate would otherwise become abandoned property or escheat to or become the property of any Governmental Entity (as defined in Section 3.06)), any such cash, dividends or distributions in respect of such Certificate shall, to the extent permitted by applicable Law, become the property of Parent, free and clear of all claims or interest of any person previously entitled thereto. 

   

 (f) _Investment of Exchange Fund._ The Paying Agent shall invest any cash included in the Exchange Fund, as directed by Parent; _provided_ , _however_ , that such investments shall be in obligations of or guaranteed by the United  ##### 

 

 

5 

  

States of America or any agency or instrumentality thereof and backed by the
full faith and credit of the United States of America, in commercial paper
obligations rated A-1 or P-1 or better by Moodys Investors Service, Inc. or
Standard and Poors Corporation, respectively, or in certificates of deposit,
bank repurchase agreements, money market accounts or bankers acceptances of
commercial banks with capital exceeding $1 billion (based on the most recent
financial statements of such bank which are then publicly available). Any
interest and other income resulting from such investments shall be paid to
Parent, and any losses shall be the sole risk of Parent. 

   

 (g) _Withholding Rights._ Parent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the consideration otherwise payable to any holder of Company Common Stock or Series B Preferred Stock pursuant to this Agreement, unless proof of eligibility of exemption therefrom reasonably satisfactory to Parent or the Paying Agent, as applicable, is provided to Parent or the Paying Agent, such amounts as may be required to be deducted and withheld with respect to the making of such payment under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the " _Code_ "), or under any provision of state, local or foreign tax Law. The Paying Agent or Parent shall provide to the holders of such securities written notice of the amounts so deducted or withheld. 

   

 SECTION 2.03. _Section 16 Matters._ Prior to the Effective Time, the Company may take all such reasonable steps as may be permitted through resolutions of the Company Board to cause the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including any dispositions of equity securities (including derivative securities) of the Company by each individual who is at the Effective Time subject to the reporting requirements of Section 16(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the " _Exchange Act_ "), with respect to the Company, to be exempt under Rule 16b-3 promulgated under the Exchange Act. 

   

ARTICLE III 

   

 _Representations and Warranties of the Company_   

  

 Except as set forth in the disclosure letter delivered to Parent by the Company on or prior to the date of this Agreement (the " _Company Disclosure Letter_ "), and subject to Section 8.06, the Company represents and warrants to Parent that: 

   

 SECTION 3.01. _Organization, Standing and Power._ Each of the Company and each of its direct and indirect subsidiaries (the " _Company Subsidiaries_ ") is duly organized, validly existing and in good standing under the laws of the jurisdiction in which it is organized and has full corporate power and authority and possesses all governmental franchises, licenses, permits, authorizations and approvals necessary to enable it to own, lease or otherwise hold its properties and assets and to conduct its businesses as presently conducted, other than such franchises, licenses, permits, authorizations and approvals the lack of which, individually or in the aggregate, has not had and is not reasonably likely to have a Company Material Adverse Effect (as defined in Section 9.03). The Company and each Company Subsidiary is duly qualified to do business in each jurisdiction where the nature of its business or its ownership or leasing  ##### 

 

 

6 

  

of its properties makes such qualification necessary or the failure to so
qualify has had or is reasonably likely to have, individually or in the
aggregate, a Company Material Adverse Effect. The Company has made available
to Parent true and complete copies of (i) the articles of incorporation of
the Company, as amended to the date of this Agreement (as so amended, the "
_Company Charter_ "), (ii) the By-laws of the Company, as amended to the date
of this Agreement (as so amended, the " _Company By-laws_ "), (iii) the
comparable charter and organizational documents of each Company Subsidiary,
in each case as amended through the date of this Agreement, and (iv) all
written consents and the minutes of all meetings of the shareholders, the
Board of Directors and each committee thereof of the Company and each Company
Subsidiary from January 1, 2004 to the date of this Agreement, other than any
portions of committee or Company Board minutes discussing Cap Rock Holding,

Each Company Benefit Plan and Company Benefit Agreement has been administered in all material respects in accordance with its terms and is in compliance in all material respects with ERISA, the Code and all other applicable Laws. Each of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries is in compliance in all material respects with ERISA, the Code and all Laws applicable to the Company Benefit Plans and Company Benefit Agreements.

Last Call, the Company shall, and shall cause its Representatives to, cease

 (f) Nothing contained in this Section 5.02 shall prohibit the Company from making any required disclosure to the Companys shareholders if, in the good faith judgment of the Company Board, after consultation with outside counsel, failure so to disclose would be inconsistent with its obligations under applicable Law. 

   

 (g) For purposes of this Agreement: 

    

 " _Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement_ " means a confidentiality agreement that: (i) provides that any recipient of non-public information of the Company shall return all non-public information and destroy all analyses, compilations, forecasts, studies and other documents in such recipients possession, to the extent they contain, reflect or are based upon any such non-public information, as soon as practicable but not later than two days following the later of (A) the end of any Extension Period applicable to such person as an Extension Party and (B) Last Call, and such destruction shall be certified in writing by an authorized officer of the counterparty to such confidentiality agreement; and (ii) without giving weight to the provision described in clause (i) of this definition, contains provisions that are no less favorable in the aggregate to the Company than those contained in the Confidentiality Agreement (as defined in Section 6.02); _provided_ ,  _however_ , that an Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement may include provisions that are less favorable in the aggregate to the Company than those contained in the Confidentiality Agreement, so long as the Company offers to amend the Confidentiality Agreement concurrently with execution of such Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement to include substantially similar provisions for the benefit of the parties thereto.

Transactions. 

   

 " _Superior Company Proposal_ " means any proposal made by a third party to acquire, directly or indirectly, 50% or more of the equity securities or 50% or more of the consolidated assets of the Company, pursuant to a tender or exchange offer, a merger, a consolidation, a share exchange, a liquidation or dissolution, a recapitalization, a sale of assets or otherwise, on terms which a majority of the disinterested members of the Company Board determines in good faith after consultation with outside counsel and the Companys independent financial advisors would be more favorable to the holders of the Company Common Stock than the Transactions, taking into account all the terms and conditions of such proposal and this Agreement (including any proposal by Parent to amend the terms of the Transactions).

similar statute or regulation is or becomes applicable to any Transaction to
which it is a party or this Agreement, (ii) if any state takeover statute or
similar statute or regulation becomes applicable to this Agreement, the
Company and the Company Board shall take all commercially reasonable
action necessary to ensure that the Exchange and the other Transactions to
which the Company or any Company Subsidiary is a party may be consummated as
promptly as practicable on the terms contemplated by this Agreement and
otherwise to minimize the effect of such statute or regulation on the
Exchange and the other Transactions to which the Company or any Company
Subsidiary is a party and (iii) the Company shall reasonably cooperate with
Parent in the arrangements for obtaining the Financing and conducting the
Debt Tender Offers as required by Sections 6.11 and 6.12. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, the Company and its Representatives shall not be prohibited under
this Section 6.03(a) from taking any action permitted by Section 5.02. 

   

 (b) The Company shall give prompt notice to Parent, and Parent shall give prompt notice to the Company, of (i) any representation or warranty made by it contained in this Agreement that is qualified as to materiality becoming untrue or inaccurate in any respect or any such representation or warranty that is not so qualified becoming untrue or inaccurate in any material respect, in either case that would cause the conditions to closing in Section 7.02(a) or 7.03 not to be satisfied, or (ii) the failure by it to comply with or satisfy in any material respect any covenant, condition or agreement to be complied with or satisfied by it under this Agreement;  _provided_ , _however_ , that no such notification shall affect the representations, warranties, covenants or agreements of the parties or the conditions to the obligations of the parties under this Agreement.  #####

 (d) Nothing in this Section 6.03 shall require Parent to consent to any action or omission by the Company or any Company Subsidiary that would be inconsistent with Section 5.01 absent such consent.

accordance with Section 2.01(a), subject to any applicable withholding
pursuant to Section 2.02(g);

 (vi) subject to Sections 6.04(i), (ii), (iii), (iv) and (v), each provision in each Company Benefit Plan and Company Benefit Agreement providing for the issuance, transfer or grant of any shares of Company Common Stock or any stock options, restricted shares, restricted stock units, performance share units or any other interests in respect of any capital stock (including any "phantom" stock or stock appreciation rights) of the Company shall be deleted prior to the Effective Time, and the Company shall ensure that, following the Effective Time, there shall be no rights to acquire shares of Company Common Stock, stock options, restricted shares, restricted stock units, performance share units or any other interests in respect of any capital stock (including any "phantom" stock or stock appreciation rights) of the Company. 

  

 SECTION 6.05. _Employee Matters._ (a) For the period from the Effective Time through the second anniversary thereof, Parent will provide or cause the Company or the Company Subsidiaries to provide to employees of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries who remain in the employment of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries after the Effective Time (the " _Continuing Employees_ ") compensation and employee benefits that are at least substantially comparable in the aggregate (including taking into account the value of any stock-based compensation plans) to the employee benefits provided to the employees of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries immediately prior to the Effective Time; _provided_ , _however_ , that none of Parent, the Company or the Company Subsidiaries or any of Parents other subsidiaries shall have any obligation to issue or adopt any plans or arrangements providing for the issuance of,  ##### 

 

 

41   

shares of capital stock, warrants, options, stock appreciation rights or other
rights in respect of any shares of capital stock of any entity or any
securities convertible or exchangeable into such shares. In addition, for the
period from the Effective Time through the second anniversary thereof, Parent
will cause the Company to maintain the Companys headquarters in Port
Huron, Michigan. 

   

 (b) From and after the Effective Time, Parent shall, and shall cause the Company and the Company Subsidiaries to, honor in accordance with their respective terms, all the severance and termination agreements and collective bargaining agreements (as in effect on the date of this Agreement and in accordance with their terms in effect on the date of this Agreement) of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries disclosed in the Company Disclosure Letter. 

   

 (c) The service of each Continuing Employee prior to the Effective Time shall be treated as service with Parent or any of its subsidiaries (other than the Company and the Company Subsidiaries) for purposes of each employee benefit plan of Parent or any of its subsidiaries (other than the Company and the Company Subsidiaries) in which such Continuing Employee is eligible to participate after the Effective Time, including for purposes of eligibility, vesting, benefit levels and accruals, including eligibility to commence an early retirement benefit (but not for purposes of benefit accrual under any defined benefit pension plans); _provided_ ,  _however_ , that such service shall not be recognized to the extent that such recognition would result in any duplication of benefits. 

   

 (d) With respect to any welfare plan maintained by Parent or its subsidiaries (other than the Company and the Company Subsidiaries) in which Continuing Employees are eligible to participate after the Effective Time, Parent shall, and shall cause its subsidiaries to, (i) waive all limitations as to preexisting conditions and exclusions with respect to participation and coverage requirements applicable to such Continuing Employees to the extent such conditions and exclusions were satisfied or did not apply to such Continuing Employees under the welfare plans of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries prior to the Effective Time and (ii) provide each Continuing Employee with credit for any co-payments and deductibles paid prior to the Effective Time in satisfying any analogous deductible or out-of-pocket requirements to the extent applicable under any such plan. 

   

 (e) The Company shall adopt such resolutions or take such other actions as may be required to amend the 2004 Supplemental Executive Retirement Plan and all supplemental retirement plan agreements (collectively, the " _SERP_ s") immediately prior to the Effective Time to provide that no funding shall be required in connection with the execution and delivery of this Agreement, the consummation of the Exchange and the other Transactions and compliance with the terms of this Agreement; _provided_ , _however_ , that the Company shall not be required to amend any SERP with respect to any beneficiary unless Parent obtains, and provides the Company with, a written consent to such amendment signed by such beneficiary prior to the date that is five days prior to Effective Time. Parent shall not seek any such written consents or negotiate or otherwise agree to the terms of any other post-Closing employment or compensation arrangements  ##### 

 

 

42 

with any employees of the Company or any Company Subsidiary until the later
of: (i) Last Call, and (ii) the end of any Extension Period. 

   

 (f) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, the parties acknowledge that with respect to matters addressed in this Agreement involving the wages, hours and terms and conditions of the employment of certain employees, the Company and the Company Subsidiaries have the obligation under Law to bargain in good faith with the collective bargaining representatives of such employees. 

   

 (g) The provisions of this Section 6.05 are included for the sole benefit of the parties to this Agreement and are not intended to confer upon any person other than the parties (including any employees, former employees, participants in the Company Benefit Plans or Company Benefit Agreements or any beneficiaries thereof) any rights or remedies. No provision of the Agreement is (A) intended, nor shall be considered to be, an amendment to any Company Benefit Plan or Company Benefit Agreement; or (B) intended to cause a right or obligation which is enforceable by a participant or beneficiary of a Company Benefit Plan or Company Benefit Agreement to a specific level of compensation or to a specific benefit. For the avoidance of doubt, any amendment to a Company Benefit Plan or Company Benefit Agreement shall occur only in accordance with their terms and shall be pursuant to actions taken which are independent of the consummation of this Agreement or any continuing obligations hereunder. 

   

 SECTION 6.06. _Indemnification._ (a) Cap Rock Holding and Parent agree that all rights to indemnification for acts or omissions occurring at or prior to the Effective Time, including the Exchange and the Transactions, now existing in favor of the current or former directors, officers, employees and agents of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries as provided in their respective articles of incorporation or By-laws, or pursuant to any other indemnification agreements in effect on the date of this Agreement (the " _Existing Indemnification Obligations_ ") shall survive the Exchange and shall continue in full force and effect in accordance with their terms. Cap Rock Holding and Parent agree to cause the Company to perform in a timely manner its obligations with respect thereto. 

   

 (b) Cap Rock Holding and Parent shall cause to be maintained for a period of not less than six years from the Effective Time the Companys current directors and officers insurance and indemnification policy to the extent that it provides coverage for events occurring at or prior to the Effective Time (the " _D andO Insurance_") for all persons who are covered by such policy as of the date of this Agreement, provided, however, that in no event shall Parent be required to expend pursuant to this Section 6.06 more than an amount per year in excess of 250% of the last annual premium paid prior to the date of this Agreement (such 250% amount, the " _Maximum Premium_ "). In the event that, but for the proviso to the immediately preceding sentence, the Company would be required to expend more than the Maximum Premium, Cap Rock Holding and Parent shall cause the Company to obtain the maximum amount of such insurance obtainable by payment of annual premiums equal to the Maximum Premium. If the existing DandO Insurance expires, is terminated or is canceled during such six-year period, Cap Rock  ##### 

 

 

43 

Holding and Parent shall use reasonable efforts to cause to be obtained as
much DandO Insurance as can be obtained for the remainder of such period for an
annualized premium not in excess of the Maximum Premium, on terms and
conditions no less advantageous than the existing DandO Insurance. The Company
represents to Parent that the Maximum Premium is $2,221,535. In lieu of Parent
causing the Company to maintain the policies described above, the Company may
elect to purchase immediately prior to the Effective Time a six-year "tail"
pre-paid policy on terms and conditions not less favorable than the current
DandO Insurance, such policy to be effective as of the Effective Time. 

   

 SECTION 6.07. _Fees and Expenses_. (a) Except as provided below and in Sections 6.11 and 6.12, all fees and expenses incurred in connection with the Exchange and the other Transactions shall be paid by the party incurring such fees or expenses, whether or not the Exchange is consummated. 

   

 (b) The Company shall pay to Parent a fee of $15,500,000 if: (i) Parent or the Company terminates this Agreement pursuant to Section 8.01(b)(iii) or 8.01(c) and in either such case (A) prior to such termination a Company Takeover Proposal by a third party has been publicly announced or otherwise become publicly known or a third party has publicly announced an intention (whether or not conditional) to make a Company Takeover Proposal and (B) the Company consummates or enters into an agreement to consummate a Company Takeover Proposal with such third party within 270 days of the termination of this Agreement; (ii) Parent terminates this Agreement pursuant to Section 8.01(e) and the Company consummates or enters into an agreement to consummate a Company Takeover Proposal within 270 days of the termination of this Agreement; (iii) the Company terminates this Agreement pursuant to Section 8.01(f) at any time after Last Call to enter into an agreement to implement a Superior Company Proposal not made by an Extension Party; or (iv) the Company terminates this Agreement pursuant to Section 8.01(f) to enter into an agreement to implement a Superior Company Proposal made by an Extension Party and such termination is effective after the end of the relevant Extension Period, _provided_ that if Parent submits a revised proposal under Section 8.01(f)(iv) in response to the Companys notice under Section 8.01(f)(iii) within 48 hours before the end of the relevant Extension Period, the relevant Extension Period shall be deemed extended for purposes of this clause (iv) until 11:59 p.m. (New York City time) on the second business day following the day on which Parent submits such revised proposal. Any fee due under this Section 6.07(b) shall be paid by wire transfer of same-day funds on the date of execution of such agreement or, if earlier, consummation of such transactions. If the Company complies with its obligations under this Section 6.07(b) and Section 6.07(d), such compliance shall constitute Parents sole remedy against the Company and any former, current or future director, officer, employee, agent, general or limited partner, manager, member, stockholder, affiliate or assignee of the Company or any former, current or future director, officer, employee, agent, general or limited partner, manager, member, stockholder, affiliate or assignee of any of the foregoing for any breach or alleged breach of this Agreement by the Company prior to the date this Agreement was terminated. 

   

 (c) The Company shall pay to Parent a fee of $7,000,000 if (i) the Company terminates this Agreement pursuant to Section 8.01(f) prior to Last Call, or (ii)  ##### 

 

 

44 

  

if the Company terminates this Agreement pursuant to Section 8.01(f) after
Last Call to enter into an agreement to implement a Superior Company Proposal
made by an Extension Party and such termination is effective before the end
of the relevant Extension Period, _provided_ that if Parent submits a revised
proposal under Section 8.01(f)(iv) in response to the Companys notice under
Section 8.01(f)(iii) within 48 hours before the end of the relevant Extension
Period, the relevant Extension Period shall be deemed extended for purposes
of this clause (ii) until 11:59 p.m. (New York City time) on the second
business day following the day on which Parent submits such revised proposal.
Any fee due under this Section 6.07(c) shall be paid by wire transfer
of same-day funds prior to the termination of this Agreement pursuant to
Section 8.01(f). If the Company complies with its obligations under this
Section 6.07(c) and Section 6.07(d), such compliance shall constitute
Parents sole remedy against the Company and any former, current or future
director, officer, employee, agent, general or limited partner, manager,
member, stockholder, affiliate or assignee of the Company or any former,
current or future director, officer, employee, agent, general or limited
partner, manager, member, stockholder, affiliate or assignee of any of the
foregoing for any breach or alleged breach of this Agreement by the
Company prior to the date this Agreement was terminated. 

   

 (d) The Company shall reimburse Parent for its reasonable out-of-pocket expenses actually incurred in connection with this Agreement, the Exchange and the other Transactions if this Agreement is terminated pursuant to Section 8.01(c). In addition, the Company shall reimburse Parent for up to $3,000,000 (provided such amount shall be $2,000,000 if the Company has paid the fee described in Section 6.07(b)) of its out-of-pocket expenses actually incurred in connection with this Agreement, the Exchange and the other Transactions if this Agreement is terminated: (i) by either Parent or the Company pursuant to Section 8.01(b)(iii) if prior to such termination either (A) the Company Board has taken, or failed to take, any action and as a result thereof Parent is entitled to terminate this Agreement under Section 8.01(e) or (B) a Company Takeover Proposal has been publicly announced or otherwise become publicly known or a third party has publicly announced an intention (whether or not conditional) to make a Company Takeover Proposal; (ii) by Parent pursuant to Section 8.01(e); or (iii) by the Company pursuant to Section 8.01(f). If this Agreement is terminated by the Company pursuant to Section 8.01(b)(iii) or 8.01(f), such reimbursement shall be paid by wire transfer of same-day funds prior to the termination of this Agreement by the Company. If this Agreement is terminated by Parent pursuant to Section 8.01(c), 8.01(b)(iii) or 8.01(e), such reimbursement shall be paid by wire transfer of same-day funds within three business days after demand therefor. 

   

 (e) Cap Rock Holding shall, or shall cause Parent to, reimburse the Company for its reasonable out-of-pocket expenses actually incurred in connection with this Agreement, the Exchange and the other Transactions if this Agreement is terminated pursuant to (i) Section 8.01(b)(iv)(B), 8.01(b)(iv)(C)(3) or 8.01(d), or (ii) Section 8.01(b)(i), if, in the case of this clause (ii), all conditions to the Exchange have been satisfied other than the proviso to the first sentence of Section 7.01(d) and clause (iii) of the second sentence of Section 7.01(d), and Section 7.02(c)(ii)(C).  ##### 

 

 

45    

 (f) In the event that this Agreement is terminated pursuant Section 8.01(d), Cap Rock Holding shall, or shall cause Parent to, promptly pay $11,250,000 (the " _Parent Fee_ ") to the Company. The parties agree that the Parent Fee is intended to compromise any dispute over the damage that the Company would suffer as a result of such a termination, that it is a reasonable measure of the damage the Company would actually suffer and is in no respect whatsoever a penalty. Payment of the Parent Fee is in lieu of damages to which the Company would be entitled as a result of Parent or Cap Rock Holdings breach of this Agreement and, to the extent paid and except as set forth in Sections 6.07(e), 6.11 and 6.12 is the Companys sole and exclusive remedy for a breach of this Agreement by Parent or Cap Rock Holding and will fully, unconditionally and irrevocably release Parent and Cap Rock Holding and any former, current or future director, officer, employee, agent, general or limited partner, manager, member, stockholder, affiliate or assignee of Parent or Cap Rock Holding or any former, current or future director, officer, employee, agent, general or limited partner, manager, member, stockholder, affiliate or assignee of any of the foregoing from any and all liability to the Company (and any other Person claiming by, through or on behalf of the Company by way of subrogation or otherwise) in connection with such breach. The parties acknowledge that the agreement contained in this Section 6.07(f) is an integral part of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and that without this agreement the parties would not have entered into this Agreement. 

   

 SECTION 6.08. _Public Announcements._ Parent, on the one hand, and the Company, on the other hand, shall consult with each other before issuing, and provide each other the opportunity to review and comment upon, any press release or other public statements with respect to the Exchange and the other Transactions and shall not issue any such press release or make any such public statement prior to such consultation, except as may be required by applicable Law, court process or by obligations pursuant to any listing agreement with any national securities exchange. 

   

 SECTION 6.09. _Transfer Taxes._ All stock transfer, real estate transfer, documentary, stamp, recording and other similar Taxes (including interest, penalties and additions to any such Taxes) (" _Transfer Taxes_ ") incurred in connection with the Transactions shall be paid by the party incurring such expenses, and the Company shall cooperate with Parent in preparing, executing and filing any Tax Returns with respect to such Transfer Taxes. 

   

 SECTION 6.10. _Shareholder and Noteholder Litigation._ The Company shall give Parent the opportunity to participate in the defense or settlement of any shareholder litigation or litigation by the holders of the Notes against the Company and its directors relating to any Transaction; _provided_ , _however_ , that no such settlement shall be agreed to without Parents consent, which shall not be unreasonably withheld. 

   

 SECTION 6.11. _Debt Tender Offers._ As soon as reasonably practicable, the Company shall, at the request of Parent, commence offers to purchase and related consent solicitations with respect to all the outstanding aggregate principal amount of the Companys 7.75% Senior Notes due 2013 (the " _2013 Notes_ ") and the Companys 7-1/8% Senior Notes due 2008 (the " _2008 Notes_ ", and together with the 2013 Notes, the " _Notes_ ")  ##### 

 

 

46 

on such terms and conditions as are requested by, and pursuant to
documentation reasonably satisfactory in form and substance to, Parent
(including the related consent solicitations, collectively, the " _Debt
Tender Offers_ ") and Parent shall assist the Company in
connection therewith. Promptly following receipt of the requisite consents
pursuant to the consent solicitation, the Company shall execute supplemental
indentures to (i) the Indenture, dated as of May 15, 2003, between the
Company and Fifth Third Bank, as trustee (the " _2013 Notes Indenture_ ") and
(ii) the Indenture, dated as of May 21, 2003, between the Company and
Fifth Third Bank, as trustee (the " _2008 Notes Indenture_ " and, together
with the 2013 Notes Indenture, the " _Indentures_ "), reflecting the
amendments to such Indentures consented to in the Debt Tender Offers, which
supplemental indentures shall be in form and substance
reasonably satisfactory to Parent and shall become operative prior to the
Effective Time subject to occurrence of the Effective Time and shall cause
the trustees under the Indentures to promptly enter into such supplemental
indentures, as applicable. The Company shall provide, and shall cause
its Representatives to provide, reasonable cooperation requested by Parent in
connection with the Debt Tender Offers. The closing of the Debt Tender Offers
shall be conditioned on (i) the occurrence of the Closing, (ii) the Financing
having been obtained, and (iii) such other conditions as are requested by
Parent, and the parties shall, unless requested otherwise by Parent, cause the
Debt Tender Offers to close on the Closing Date. The Company shall waive any
condition of the Debt Tender Offers, and make any change, amendment or
modification to the terms and conditions of the Debt Tender Offers (including
extensions thereof), as may be requested by Parent (other than a waiver or
modification of the condition that the Debt Tender Offers be conditioned on
the occurrence of the Closing), and will not, without the prior written
consent of Parent, waive any condition to the Debt Tender Offers or make any
change, amendment or modification to the terms and conditions of the Debt
Tender Offers (including any extension thereof). Parent and Cap Rock Holding
shall advance or reimburse (at the Companys discretion), or cause its
affiliates to advance or reimburse, the Company for its reasonable out-of-
pocket fees and expenses incurred or reasonably expected to be incurred
pursuant to this Section 6.11. The Debt Tender Offers and other actions taken
in connection therewith shall be conducted in accordance with the terms of
the applicable Indentures and all applicable rules and resolutions of the SEC
and other applicable Law. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained
in this Agreement, prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall not be
required to take any action that could obligate the Company to repurchase any
Notes or incur any additional obligations to the holders of the Notes prior to
the consummation of the Debt Tender Offers. The closing of the Debt Tender
Offers shall not be a condition to the Closing. 

   

 SECTION 6.12. _Financing._ (a) The Company shall, and shall cause the Company Subsidiaries and its and their Representatives to, cooperate as reasonably requested by Cap Rock Holding and Parent and take such actions as Cap Rock Holding and Parent may reasonably request in connection with the procurement and consummation of the transactions contemplated by the Debt Commitment Letter and other incurrences of debt by Cap Rock Holding in connection with the Exchange (collectively, the " _Financing_ ") and the repayment of existing indebtedness of, and release of Liens on the assets and property of, the Company and the Company Subsidiaries, which cooperation shall include provision of such information regarding the Company  #####

Closing Date), review and consultation with respect to the preparation of all
agreements, offering memoranda and other documentation (including review
of schedules for completeness) required in connection with the Financing,
attendance and participation at meetings by telephone and in person with
respect to syndication and marketing as reasonably requested, and execution

their officers, attorneys and accountants of agreements, customary
certificates, legal opinions or other documents and instruments relating to
borrowings by the Company concurrent with the Effective Time, guarantees, the
pledge of collateral and other matters ancillary to the Financing as may
be reasonably requested by Parent in connection with the Financing;
_provided_ , _however_ , that no obligation of the Company or any Company
Subsidiary under any such agreement, certificate, document or instrument will
be effective until the Effective Time and none of the Company or any Company
Subsidiary will be required to pay any commitment or other similar fee or
incur any other liability, other than out-of-pocket expenses incidental to
such cooperation to be reimbursed by Parent, in connection with the Financing
prior to the Effective Time. Parent shall reimburse, or cause its affiliates
to reimburse, the Company for its reasonable out-of-pocket fees and
expenses incurred pursuant to this Section 6.12. To the extent not provided
prior to the date of this Agreement, the Company shall deliver to Cap Rock
Holding, within five business days of such data being available to the
Companys management, monthly financial data generated by the
Companys internal accounting systems for use by senior and financial
management for any fiscal month ending after the date of the most recently
ended fiscal quarter of the Company for which financial statements are
publicly available and on or prior to 30 days before the Closing Date. The
closing of the Financing shall not be a condition to the Closing. 

   

 (b) In the event the Equity Commitment Letter is terminated prior to the Closing, Parent and Cap Rock Holding shall promptly obtain a renewal of, or a substitute for, the Equity Commitment Letter on terms and conditions comparable in all material respects to the terms and conditions contemplated in the Equity Commitment Letter or on more favorable terms to Parent and Cap Rock Holding. In the event any portion of the equity to be provided under the Equity Commitment Letter becomes unavailable on terms and conditions comparable in all material respects to the terms and conditions contemplated in the Equity Commitment Letter, each of Parent and Cap Rock Holding shall arrange to obtain any such portion from alternative sources on comparable or more favorable terms to Parent and Cap Rock Holding. Parent and Cap Rock Holding shall give the Company prompt notice upon becoming aware of any breach by any party of the Equity Commitment Letter or any purported termination of the Equity Commitment Letter. Parent and Cap Rock Holding shall not permit any material amendment or modification to be made to, or any waiver of any provision or remedy under, the Equity Commitment Letter if such amendment, modification, waiver or remedy reduces the aggregate amount of the equity to be provided under the Equity Commitment Letter or is adverse to the interests of the Company in any other respect.  #####

The Company shall terminate the DRP by no later than the earlier of 45 calendar days following the date of the Company Shareholder Approval and five days prior to Closing.

 (d) by the Company, if Parent or Cap Rock Holding breaches or fails to perform in any material respect any of its representations, warranties or covenants contained in this Agreement, which breach or failure to perform (i) would cause any of the conditions set forth in Section 7.03 not to be satisfied and (ii) cannot be or has not been cured within 30 days after the giving of written notice to Parent of such breach; _provided_ that such time period shall be extended an additional 30 days if Parent or Cap Rock Holding has made good faith diligent efforts to cure such breach or failure to perform within such initial 30 day period; 

   

 (e) by Parent: 

    

 (i) if the Company Board withdraws or modifies, in a manner adverse to Parent, or proposes publicly to withdraw or modify, in a manner adverse to Parent, its approval or recommendation of this Agreement or the Exchange, fails to recommend to the holders of the Company Common Stock that they give the Company Shareholder Approval or approves or recommends, or proposes to approve or recommend, any Company Takeover Proposal; or 

   

 (ii) if the Company Board fails to reaffirm publicly and unconditionally its recommendation to the holders of the Company Common Stock that they give the Company Shareholder Approval within 20 business days of Parents written request to do so (which request may be made at any time after Last Call following public disclosure of a Company Takeover Proposal), which public reaffirmation must also include the unconditional rejection of such Company Takeover Proposal; or 

  

 (f) by the Company, only if (i) the Company Board has received a Superior Company Proposal, (ii) in light of such Superior Company Proposal, a  ##### 

 

 

52     

majority of the disinterested members of the Company Board has determined in
good faith after consultation with the Companys outside counsel, that it is
necessary for the Company Board to withdraw or modify, in a manner adverse to
Parent, its approval of this Agreement and the Transactions in order to be
consistent with its fiduciary duties under applicable Law, (iii) the
Company has notified Parent in writing of the determinations described in
(ii) above, (iv) at least five days following receipt by Parent of the notice
referred to in clause (iii) above, and taking into account any revised

 SECTION 8.02. _Effect of Termination._ In the event of termination of this Agreement by either the Company or Parent as provided in Section 8.01, this Agreement shall forthwith become void and have no effect, without any liability or obligation on the part of Parent or the Company, other than Section 3.23, Section 4.05, the last sentence of Section 6.02, Section 6.07, Parents obligation to reimburse the Company for its reasonable out-of-pocket expenses under Sections 6.11 and 6.12, this Section 8.02 and Article IX, which provisions shall survive such termination, and except to the extent that such termination results from the breach by a party of any representation, warranty or covenant set forth in this Agreement. 

   

 SECTION 8.03. _Amendment._ This Agreement may be amended by the parties at any time before or after receipt of the Company Shareholder Approval; _provided_ , _however_ , that (i) after receipt of the Company Shareholder Approval, there shall be made no amendment that by Law requires further approval by the shareholders of the Company without the further approval of such shareholders, (ii) no amendment shall be made to this Agreement after the Effective Time and (iii) except as provided above, no amendment of this Agreement by the Company shall require the approval of the shareholders of the Company.

Any agreement on the part of a party to any such  ##### 

 

 

53   

extension or waiver shall be valid only if set forth in an instrument in
writing signed on behalf of such party. The failure of any party to this
Agreement to assert any of its rights under this Agreement or otherwise shall
not constitute a waiver of such rights. 

   

 SECTION 8.05. _Procedure for Termination, Amendment, Extension or Waiver._ A termination of this Agreement pursuant to Section 8.01, an amendment of this Agreement pursuant to Section 8.03 or an extension or waiver pursuant to Section 8.04 shall, in order to be effective, require in the case of Parent or the Company, action by its Board of Directors or the duly authorized designee of its Board of Directors, and in the case of Cap Rock Holding, action by an executive manager. Termination of this Agreement prior to the Effective Time shall not require the approval of the shareholders of the Company. 

   

 SECTION 8.06. _Certain Disclosure Matters._ (a) Each disclosure of the Company set forth in the Company Disclosure Letter shall limit a representation or warranty of the Company only to the extent such disclosure specifically references the particular representation or warranty it is intended to qualify or it is reasonably apparent on the face of such disclosure that it qualifies such particular representation or warranty. 

   

 (b) For purposes of determining whether the Company has disclosed, or whether Parent has, information that is or may be inconsistent with any representation and warranty of the Company in this Agreement, the Company may not rely on information that is included in any document furnished to (but not filed with) the SEC.
