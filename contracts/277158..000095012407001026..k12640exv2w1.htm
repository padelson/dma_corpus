hereinafter referred to as the &#147;<U>Exchange Fund</U>&#148;).
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) <U>Exchange Procedure.</U> As soon as reasonably practicable after the Effective Time,
the Paying Agent shall mail to each holder of record of a certificate or certificates that
immediately prior to the Effective Time represented outstanding shares of Company Common Stock or
Series&nbsp;B Preferred Stock whose shares were transferred to Parent for the Exchange Consideration
pursuant to Section&nbsp;2.01(a) (the &#147;<U>Certificates</U>&#148;), (i)&nbsp;a letter of transmittal (which shall
specify that delivery of the Exchange Consideration shall be effected only upon delivery of the
Certificates to the Paying Agent and shall be in such form and have such other provisions as Parent
may reasonably specify) and (ii)&nbsp;instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the
Certificates in exchange for Exchange Consideration. Upon surrender of a Certificate to the Paying
Agent, together with such letter of transmittal, duly executed, and such other documents as may
reasonably be required by the Paying Agent, the holder of such Certificate shall be entitled to
receive in exchange therefor the amount of cash for which the shares of Company Common Stock or
Series&nbsp;B Preferred Stock, as the case may be, theretofore represented by such Certificate were
transferred pursuant to Section&nbsp;2.01(a), and the Certificate so surrendered shall forthwith be

reason of the payment to a person other than the registered holder of such Certificate or establish
to the satisfaction of Parent that such tax has been paid or is not applicable. Until surrendered
as contemplated by this Section&nbsp;2.02, each Certificate shall be deemed at any time after the

undistributed to the holders of Company Common Stock and Series&nbsp;B Preferred Stock for nine months
after the Effective Time, together with any gains thereon, may be delivered to Parent, upon demand,
and any holder of Certificates who has not theretofore complied with this Article&nbsp;II shall
thereafter look only to Parent for payment of its claim for Exchange Consideration.

any person in respect of any cash from the Exchange Fund delivered to a public official pursuant to
any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar Law. If any Certificate has not been
surrendered prior to such date on which Exchange Consideration in respect of such Certificate would
otherwise become abandoned property or escheat to or become the property of any Governmental Entity
(as defined in Section&nbsp;3.06)), any such cash, dividends or distributions in respect of such
Certificate shall, to the extent permitted by applicable Law, become the property of Parent, free
