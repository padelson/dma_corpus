ARTICLE 1

Sellers will sell, assign, transfer, convey and deliver unto US Buyer, and US

hundred and ninety-four thousand and two hundred and twenty-five and 00/100
Dollars ($334,494,225.00), as adjusted pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 1.2_ and
_Section_ __ _ 1.3_ (the " _Cash Purchase Price_ ") and (b) five million
(5,000,000) shares of Buyer Parent Common Stock (the " _Share Purchase Price_
" and, together with the Cash Purchase Price, the " _Purchase Price_ "). The
Share Purchase Price and the Cash Purchase Price shall be apportioned among
the Sellers in accordance with _Schedule_ __ _ 1.1_. The number of shares of
Buyer Parent Common Stock constituting the Share Purchase Price shall be
proportionately adjusted to reflect any stock split, combination of shares,
stock dividend or other similar event affecting the Buyer Parent Common Stock
occurring after the date of this Agreement and prior to the Effective Time.

 

SECTION 1.2 _Cash Purchase Price Adjustments_.

 

1.2.1. _Adjustments to Cash Purchase Price_. The Cash Purchase Price shall be
adjusted in the manner provided in this Section 1.2. The Cash Purchase Price
shall be:

(a) increased by the amount, if any, by which the Closing Date Net Working
Capital exceeds the Net Working Capital Target,

(b) decreased by the amount, if any, by which the Net Working Capital Target
exceeds the Closing Date Net Working Capital,

(c) increased by the Closing Date Cash on Hand,

 

(d) decreased by the Closing Date Indebtedness, and

 

(e) decreased by the Closing Date Transaction Expenses.

 



2

    

1.2.2. _Estimate Statement_. At least five (5) Business Days prior to the
Closing, Seller Representative shall provide Buyers with a written statement
(the " _Estimate Statement_ ") setting forth, in reasonable detail, Seller
Representatives good faith written estimate of (a) the Closing Date Net
Working Capital, (b) the Closing Date Cash on Hand, (c) the Closing Date
Indebtedness and (d) the Closing Date Transaction Expenses. The Closing Date
Indebtedness and the Closing Date Transaction Expenses in the
Estimate Statement and the Flow of Funds shall be based on amounts set forth
in the Indebtedness Payoff Letters and Transaction Expense Payoff Letters or,
to the extent an Indebtedness Payoff Letter or Transaction Expense Payoff
Letter has not been provided, a good faith estimate by Seller Representative
of such amount, in each case subject to final determination pursuant to this
_Section 1.2_. If Buyers have any questions or disagreements regarding the
Estimate Statement, Buyers shall contact Seller Representative at least one
(1) Business Day prior to the Closing, and in such case Seller Representative
and Buyers shall in good faith attempt to resolve any disagreements. If Seller
Representative and Buyers agree on changes to the Estimate Statement based on
such discussions, then the Estimate Statement shall, for purposes of the
Estimated Cash Purchase Price (and components thereof) at Closing, be based on
such changes. If Seller Representative and Buyers do not agree on changes to
the Estimate Statement, then the amounts in Seller Representatives Estimate
Statement shall apply for purposes of the Estimated Cash Purchase Price (and
components thereof) at Closing. In either such case, the amounts in
the Estimate Statement shall be subject to final determination pursuant to
_Section 1.2_.

1.2.3. _Closing Statement_. Within ninety (90) calendar days following the
Closing Date, Buyers shall prepare and deliver to Seller Representative a
closing statement setting forth Buyers calculation of (a) the Closing Date
Net Working Capital, (b) the Closing Date Cash on Hand, (c) the Closing Date
Indebtedness, (d) the Closing Date Transaction Expenses and (e) the Net
Adjustment Amount, in each case, with reasonable supporting detail and
documentation (the " _Closing Statement_ "). Buyers shall (i) provide Seller
Representative and his Representatives with reasonable access (during normal
business hours upon reasonable advance notice to Buyers, under the supervision
of Buyer Parents personnel and in such a manner as not to unreasonably
interfere with the conduct of the Business) to the books, records, work
papers, and other documents pertaining to or used in connection with
preparation of the Closing Statement that are in Buyer Parents or any of its
Affiliates possession or control as are reasonably necessary and appropriate
for the Seller Representative to assess, confirm or object to the calculations
in the Closing Statement, and provide Seller Representative with copies
thereof reasonably requested by Seller Representative, and (ii) provide Seller
Representative and his Representatives with reasonable access to
Representatives of Buyers responsible for and knowledgeable about
the information used in, and the preparation or calculation of, the Closing
Statement, as reasonably requested by Seller Representative with reasonable
advance notice, so that Seller Representative and his Representatives may make
reasonable inquiries of Representatives of Buyers.

1.2.4. _Sellers Objection_. If Seller Representative, acting in good faith,
disagrees with any part of the calculations or determinations set forth in
the Closing Statement (the " _Disputed Items_ "), Seller Representative shall,
within thirty (30) calendar days after Seller Representatives receipt of
the Closing Statement (" _Objection Date_ "), provide Buyers with

 



3

    

 written notice of such disagreement by setting forth in reasonable detail
Seller Representatives Disputed Items and proposed changes, and, the basis
for such disagreement with respect to the calculations or determinations set
forth in the Closing Statement, together with reasonable additional
information and supporting documentation thereof as is reasonably appropriate
to support Seller Representatives calculations and analysis (an " _Objection
Notice_ "). If a proper Objection Notice is timely delivered to Buyers on or
before the Objection Date, then Buyers and Seller Representative shall
negotiate in good faith to resolve their disagreements with respect to any
Disputed Items in such Objection Notice. If Buyers and Seller Representative
are unable to resolve all such disagreements within fourteen (14) calendar
days after Buyers receipt of a proper Objection Notice, either Buyers or
Seller Representative may thereafter submit such remaining Disputed Items (but
no others) to the San Antonio, Texas office of KPMG, or such other nationally
recognized certified public independent accounting firm as is acceptable to
Buyers and Seller Representative (the " _Accounting Firm_ "). The undisputed
portion of the Closing Statement, if any, will be final and binding on all
Parties for all purposes of this Agreement. Any matters set forth in the
Closing Statement that are not included as Disputed Items in a timely
delivered Objection Notice shall be deemed accepted by the Seller
Representative and shall be final and binding on all Parties for all purposes
of this Agreement, and (i) the failure by the Seller Representative to
provide an Objection Notice by the Objection Date or (ii) the delivery by
Seller Representative to Buyers before the Objection Date of a written notice
stating that the Seller Representative has elected not to deliver
an Objection Notice, will constitute a full and complete acceptance of the
Closing Statement as determined by Buyers and such Closing Statement shall be
final and binding on all Parties for all purposes of this Agreement.

 

1.2.5. _Accounting Firm Procedures_. Buyers and Seller Representative shall
use commercially reasonable efforts to cause the Accounting Firm to resolve
all remaining Disputed Items (but no others) as soon as practicable, but in
any event shall direct the Accounting Firm to render a written determination
within forty-five (45) calendar days after its engagement and considering the
respective positions as to each remaining Disputed Item in accordance with the
terms of this _Section 1.2.5_. Each of Seller Representative and Buyers shall
have the right to provide the Accounting Firm and the other Party with a
statement of their respective positions as to the amount for each Disputed
Item within ten (10) Business Days after the date the remaining Disputed Items
are submitted to the Accounting Firm; _provided_ , that if a Party fails to
deliver such statement within such ten (10) Business Day period, such Party
shall be deemed to have accepted and taken the other Partys position as to
the amount of each remaining Disputed Item. The Accounting Firm shall consider
only those Disputed Items and amounts (and any statement and substantiating
documentation from Buyers or Seller Representative in connection therewith)
that are identified as the items in dispute. For the avoidance of doubt, the
Parties shall not disclose, directly or indirectly, any communications among
the Parties with respect to the negotiation or settlement of any Disputed
Items to the Accounting Firm. In resolving any Disputed Item, the Parties will
direct the Accounting Firm not to assign a value to any item greater than the
greatest value for such item claimed by either Party or less than the smallest
value for such item claimed by either Party. The Accounting Firms
determination of the Disputed Items shall be made based solely on the
statements and substantiating documentation submitted by Buyers and Seller
Representative ( _i.e_., not on

 



4

    

 an independent review), the applicable provisions and definitions set forth
herein, and an analysis that is consistent with and in accordance with the
methodologies and principles contemplated herein. If at any time Seller
Representative and Buyers resolve any Disputed Items, then notwithstanding the
preceding provisions of this _Section 1.2.5_, the Accounting Firms
involvement promptly shall be discontinued as to such Disputed Items and the
Closing Statement shall be revised, if necessary, to reflect such resolution
and thereupon shall be final and binding on the Parties for all purposes of
this Agreement. The Parties shall make readily available to the Accounting
Firm all relevant books, records, work papers, and other documents relating to
the Disputed Items and all other items reasonably requested by the Accounting
Firm in connection with resolving the disagreement regarding the Disputed
Items. The determination of the Accounting Firm shall be final and binding
upon all Parties as an arbitral award, and shall not be subject to appeal or
further review absent manifest error.

 

1.2.6. _Accounting Firm Expenses_. The costs and expenses of the Accounting
Firm incurred in connection with any payment under this _Section 1.2_ shall
be borne by Buyers, on the one hand, and Seller Representative (on behalf of
Sellers), on the other hand, based upon the percentage that the portion of the
contested amount not awarded to each Party bears to the amount actually
contested by such Party. For example, if Buyers claim the Closing Date Net
Working Capital is $1,000 _less_ than the amount determined by Seller
Representative, and Seller Representative contests only $500 of the
amount claimed by Buyers, and if the Accounting Firm ultimately resolves the
dispute by awarding Buyers $300 of the $500 contested, then the costs and
expenses of the Accounting Firm attributable to such item will be allocated
60% ( _i.e_., 300 ÷ 500) to Seller Representative (on behalf of Sellers) and
40% ( _i.e_., 200 ÷ 500) to Buyers.

1.2.7.  _Net Adjustment Amount_. Within five (5) Business Days after the
items set forth in the Closing Statement are finally determined pursuant to
this _Section 1.2_, and subject to _Section 1.2.8_:

 

(a) If the Net Adjustment Amount is positive, Buyers shall, and Buyer Parent
shall cause Buyers to, deliver to Seller Representative (on behalf of
Sellers) such Net Adjustment Amount; and

(b) If the Net Adjustment Amount is negative, Seller Representative (on
behalf of Sellers) shall deliver to Buyers cash in an amount equal to the
absolute value of the Net Adjustment Amount. In such event, Buyers and Seller
Representative will deliver joint written instructions to the Escrow
Agent instructing the Escrow Agent to pay to Buyers from the Indemnification
Escrow Account cash in an amount equal to the absolute value of the Net
Adjustment Amount; _provided_ , that if the distributable amounts in the
Indemnification Escrow Account are insufficient to pay the entire Net
Adjustment Amount, Sellers shall pay such excess amount from other sources.

 

1.2.8. _Payment of Net Adjustment Amount_. All payments of the Net Adjustment
Amount, if any, shall be made pursuant to  _Section 1.2.7_ by wire transfer
of immediately available funds to the account or accounts designated by Buyers
or Seller Representative, as the case may be, within five (5) Business Days
after the final determination thereof.

1.2.9. _Closing and Post-Closing Bonuses_. Buyer Parent shall, and shall
cause the Companies to, pay all cash bonuses payable in connection with the
Closing (the " _Closing Bonuses_ ") and payable subject to satisfying certain
vesting requirements post-Closing (the " _Post-Closing Bonuses_ ", and each
Post-Closing Bonus or Closing Bonus, a " _Bonus_ ") in the amounts equal to
the "Closing Bonus Amount" (with respect to a Closing Bonus) and "Post-Closing
Bonus Amount" (with respect to a Post-Closing Bonus) when and as owed, in
each case as, and under the terms, set forth on the "Closing and Post-Closing
Bonus Schedule" (a copy of which is attached to the Bonus Letter, the "
_Bonus Schedule_ "); _provided_ ; that if any Bonus is not paid when and as
owed as set forth in the Bonus Schedule or is cancelled prior to payment, then
Buyer Parent shall promptly pay to Seller Representative, on behalf
of Sellers, an amount equal to the "Net Closing Bonus Obligation" (with
respect to a Closing Bonus) or "Net Post-Closing Bonus Obligation" (with
respect to a Post-Closing Bonus), as applicable, set forth for such Bonus on
the Bonus Schedule.

SECTION 1.3 _Earnout_. Upon the terms and subject to the conditions of this
_Section 1.3_, Buyers shall pay (or cause to be paid) to Sellers the dollar
amount, if any, that becomes payable in accordance with the provisions of this
_Section_ _ 1.3_. Any amounts due pursuant to this _Section_ _ _ _1.3_ shall
be calculated based on the results of a complete, applicable Earnout Period,
and in no event shall the results or operations of any interim period cause
the vesting or accrual of any amounts hereunder:

 

1.3.1. For each Earnout Period, Sellers shall be entitled to receive a payment
from Buyers in an aggregate amount in cash (each, an " _E-Set Earnout
Payment_") equal to sixty percent (60%) of the EBIT generated by or
attributable to the E-Set Business for each calendar year (each such calendar
year, an " _Earnout Period_ ") beginning on January 1, 2019 and ending on
December 31, 2025, inclusive (the " _Earnout Term_ "); _provided_ that, for
the avoidance of doubt, in the event that the EBIT generated by or
attributable to the E-Set Business for any Earnout Period is less than or
equal to zero, Buyers, Buyer Parent and the Companies shall have no obligation
to make any E-Set Earnout Payment for such Earnout Period. Sellers acknowledge
and agree that the amount of any E-Set Earnout Payment is speculative, Buyers
have provided no assurance that any particular amount or level of any E-Set
Earnout Payment will be payable to Sellers and Buyers have not promised or
projected the amount or payment of any E-Set Earnout Payment.

1.3.2. For the Earnout Period beginning January 1, 2019 and ending December
31, 2019 (the " _Sales Earnout Period_ "), if there are Completed Sales of
(i) at or fewer than 18,000 units of Dissolvable Plugs, Sellers shall not be
entitled to receive any payment from Buyers under this  _Section_ _ _ _1.3.2_
, or (ii) at or more than 18,001 units of Dissolvable Plugs, Sellers shall be
entitled to receive a payment from Buyers in cash equal to the lesser of (x)
$25,000,000 and (y) the product of (A) $25,000,000 and (B) the quotient of
(1) the difference between such number of units of Dissolvable Plugs sold in
Completed Sales and 18,000 and (2) 9,200 (any such payment, the " _Sales
Earnout Payment_ "). For example, if there were Completed Sales of 25,820
Dissolvable Plugs in Sales Earnout Period, Sellers

 



6

    

 shall be entitled to receive a payment from Buyers of $21,250,000 in cash
[$25,000,000*(7,820/9,200)]. Sellers acknowledge and agree that the amount of
any Sales Earnout Payment is speculative, Buyers have provided no assurance
that any particular amount or level of any Sales Earnout Payment will be
payable to Sellers and Buyers have not promised or projected the amount or
payment of any Sales Earnout Payment. For the avoidance of doubt, in no event
shall the Sales Earnout Payment exceed $25,000,000.

 

1.3.3. (i) No later than ninety (90) calendar days after the completion of any
Earnout Period, Buyers and Buyer Parent shall prepare and deliver to Seller
Representative a written statement setting forth Buyers calculation of the
Earnout EBIT for such Earnout Period with reasonable supporting detail and
documentation and (ii) no later than thirty (30) calendar days after the
completion of the Sales Earnout Period, Buyers and Buyer Parent shall prepare
and deliver to Seller Representative a written statement setting forth Buyers
calculation of the Completed Sales for the Sales Earnout Period with
reasonable supporting detail and documentation (each such statement described
in the foregoing _clauses_ _(i)_ and _(ii)_ , an " _Earnout Statement_ ").
Earnout EBIT and any related financial calculations under this _Section_ _
1.3.3_ shall be made in accordance with the methodologies and principles set
forth on _Exhibit E_ and, in the case of both EBIT and Completed Sales,
otherwise in accordance with GAAP. Buyers shall (i) provide Seller
Representative and his Representatives with reasonable access (during normal
business hours upon reasonable advance notice to Buyers, under the supervision
of the Companies personnel and in such a manner as not to unreasonably
interfere with the conduct of the Business) to the books, records, work
papers, and other documents pertaining to or used in connection with
preparation of the Earnout Statement that are in Buyers, Buyer Parents,
or Companys possession or control (including the possession or control of
any Representative of the Company, Buyers, or Buyer Parent) for the purpose of
confirming, reviewing, assessing, and, if applicable, objecting to the
calculations in the Earnout Statement, and provide Seller Representative with
copies thereof reasonably requested by Seller Representative, and (ii) provide
Seller Representative and his Representatives with reasonable access to
Representatives of Buyers responsible for and knowledgeable about the
information used in, and the preparation or calculation of, any Earnout
Statement, as reasonably requested by Seller Representative with reasonable
advance notice, so that Seller Representative and his Representatives may
make reasonable inquiries of Representatives of Buyers.

1.3.4. If Seller Representative, acting in good faith, disagrees with any
part of the calculations or determinations of the Earnout EBIT or Completed
Sales set forth in an Earnout Statement (the " _Earnout Disputed Items_ "),
Seller Representative shall, within thirty (30) calendar days after Seller
Representatives receipt of such Earnout Statement (the " _Earnout Objection
Date_ "), provide Buyers with written notice of such disagreement by setting
forth in reasonable detail Seller Representatives Earnout Disputed Items and
proposed changes, and, the basis for such disagreement with respect to the
calculations or determinations set forth in such Earnout Statement, together
with reasonable additional information and supporting documentation thereof
as is reasonably appropriate to support Seller Representatives calculations
and analysis (an " _Earnout Objection Notice_ "). If a proper Earnout
Objection Notice is timely delivered to Buyers on or before the applicable
Earnout Objection Date, then Buyers and Seller Representative shall negotiate
in good faith to resolve their disagreements with respect to any Earnout
Disputed Items in such Earnout 

 



7

    

 Objection Notice. If Buyers and Seller Representative are unable to resolve
all such disagreements within fourteen (14) calendar days after Buyers
receipt of an Earnout Objection Notice, either Buyers or Seller
Representative may thereafter submit such remaining Earnout Disputed Items
(but no others) to the Accounting Firm. The undisputed portion of such Earnout
Statement, if any, will be final and binding on all Parties for all purposes
of this Agreement. Any matters set forth in the applicable Earnout Statement
that are not included as Earnout Disputed Items in a timely delivered and
proper Earnout Objection Notice shall be deemed accepted by Seller
Representative and shall be final and binding on all Parties for all purposes
of this Agreement, and (i) the failure by Seller Representative to provide an
Earnout Objection Notice by the applicable Earnout Objection Date or (ii) the
delivery by Seller Representative to Buyers before such Earnout Objection
Date of a written notice stating that Seller Representative has elected not to
deliver an Earnout Objection Notice, will constitute a full and complete
acceptance of such Earnout Statement as determined by Buyers and such Earnout
Statement shall be final and binding on all Parties for all purposes of this
Agreement.

 

1.3.5. Buyers and Seller Representative shall use commercially reasonable
efforts to cause the Accounting Firm to resolve all remaining Earnout
Disputed Items (but no others) with respect to any Earnout Period as soon as
practicable, but in any event shall direct the Accounting Firm to render a
written determination within forty-five (45) calendar days after
its engagement and considering the respective positions as to each remaining
Earnout Disputed Item in accordance with the terms of this _Section_ _
1.3.5_. Each of Seller Representative and Buyers shall have the right to
provide the Accounting Firm and the other Party with a statement of its
position as to the amount for each Earnout Disputed Item within ten (10)
Business Days after the date the remaining Earnout Disputed Items are
submitted to the Accounting Firm;  _provided_ , that if a Party fails to
deliver such statement within such ten (10) Business Day period, such Party
shall be deemed to have accepted and taken the other Partys position as to
the amount of each remaining Earnout Disputed Item. The Accounting Firm shall
consider only those Earnout Disputed Items and amounts (and any statement and
substantiating documentation from Buyers or Seller Representative in
connection therewith) that are identified as the items in dispute. For the
avoidance of doubt, the Parties shall not disclose, directly or indirectly,
any communications among the Parties with respect to the negotiation or
settlement of any Earnout Disputed Items to the Accounting Firm. In resolving
any Earnout Disputed Item, the Parties will direct the Accounting Firm not to
assign a value to any item greater than the greatest value for such item
claimed by either Party or less than the smallest value for such item claimed
by either Party. The Accounting Firms determination of any Earnout Disputed
Items shall be made based solely on the statements and substantiating
documentation submitted by Buyers and Seller Representative ( _i.e_., not on
an independent review), the applicable provisions and definitions set forth
herein, and an analysis that is consistent with and in accordance with the
methodologies and principles contemplated herein. If at any time Seller
Representative and Buyers resolve any Earnout Disputed Items, then
notwithstanding the preceding provisions of this _Section_ _ 1.3.5_, the
Accounting Firms involvement promptly shall be discontinued as to such
Earnout Disputed Items and the applicable Earnout Statement shall be revised,
if necessary, to reflect such resolution and thereupon shall be final and
binding for all purposes of this Agreement and such Earnout Period. The
Parties shall make readily available to the Accounting Firm all relevant
books, records, work papers, and other

 



8

    

 documents relating to any Earnout Disputed Items and all other items
reasonably requested by the Accounting Firm in connection with resolving the
disagreement regarding any Earnout Disputed Items. The determination of the
Accounting Firm with respect to any Earnout Disputed Items shall be final and
binding upon all Parties as an arbitral award, and shall not be subject to
appeal or further review absent manifest error.

 

1.3.6. The costs and expenses of the Accounting Firm incurred in connection
with any engagement under this  _Section_ _ 1.3_ shall be borne by Buyers,
on the one hand, and Seller Representative (on behalf of Sellers), on the
other hand, based upon the percentage that the portion of the contested amount
not awarded to each Party bears to the amount actually contested by such
Party. For example, if Seller Representative claims an Earnout Payment is
$1,000 _more_ than the amount determined by Buyers, and Buyers contest only
$500 of the amount claimed by Seller Representative, and if the Accounting
Firm ultimately resolves the dispute by awarding Seller Representative $300 of
the $500 contested, then the costs and expenses of the Accounting Firm
attributable to such item will be allocated 60% ( _i.e_ _._ , 300 ÷ 500) to
Buyers and 40% ( _i.e._ , 200 ÷ 500) to Seller Representative (on behalf of
Sellers).

1.3.7. When an Earnout Statement becomes final and binding in accordance with
_Section_ _ 1.3.4_ and _Section_ _ 1.3.5_, if there is an Earnout Payment
owing to Sellers with respect thereto, then, subject to  _Section_ _ 7.8.1_,
no later than five (5) Business Days of such Earnout Statement becoming final
and binding, Buyers shall pay such Earnout Payment by wire transfer of
immediately available funds to Sellers addressed to such account or accounts
designated by Seller Representative. In addition, if a proper Earnout
Objection Notice has been timely delivered pursuant to _Section_ _ 1.3.4_
with respect to any Earnout Period, the portion of the applicable Earnout
Payment (if any) set forth in the applicable Earnout Statement that is not in
dispute shall be paid within twenty (20) Business Days after the date on which
such Earnout Statement is delivered in accordance with  _Section_ _ 1.3.3_;
_provided_ , _however_ , that Buyers and Buyer Parent shall have no obligation
to pay any portion of such Earnout Payment (if any) that is in dispute until
five (5) Business Days after the date that such Earnout Statement becomes
final and binding in accordance with _Section_ _ 1.3.5_.

1.3.8. Until the end of the Earnout Term (with respect to the E-Set Business)
and Sales Earnout Period (with respect to the Dissolvable Plugs Business),
Buyers and Buyer Parent agree, except as otherwise provided herein
or consented to in writing by Seller Representative, to make all decisions
with respect to the operation of the E-Set Business and the Dissolvable Plugs
Business, respectively, in good faith, and not to take any actions or omit to
take any actions (A) for the primary purpose of, or (B) that would without a
good faith business reason unrelated to the results described in the following
clauses (i) and (ii) reasonably be expected to result in, in each case (i)
thwarting or inhibiting the achievement of an Earnout Payment or (ii) reducing
the Earnout EBIT or number of Completed Sales or the amount of an Earnout
Payment. Subject to the provisions of this  _Section_ _ 1.3.8_ and _Section_
_ 1.3.9_, Sellers acknowledge and agree that, (a) after the Closing, Buyers
and their Affiliates shall have the right to operate the Companies and the
Business, including the E-Set Business and the Dissolvable Plugs Business, in
any manner they believe to be prudent and to make any and all decisions with
respect to the

 



9

    

 Companies and the Business, including the E-Set Business and the Dissolvable
Plugs Business (but with regard to the E-Set Business and the Dissolvable
Plugs Business only to the extent consistent with clauses (i) and (ii) of the
preceding sentence and _Section 1.3.9_), in their sole discretion, (b)
Buyers, Buyer Parent and their respective Affiliates are not obligated to
operate the Companies or the Business, including the E-Set Business and the
Dissolvable Plugs Business, or to take any actions or refrain from taking any
actions, in order to achieve payment of any Earnout Payment or to maximize any
Earnout Payment (and Buyers and Buyer Parent have not promised nor projected
any particular amount or level of any Earnout Payment), (c) subject to
_Sections 1.3.12_ and _1.3.13_ , Buyers, Buyer Parent or their respective
Affiliates are not prohibited from engaging in any business, opportunity,
acquisition, entry into a joint venture, investment or otherwise
cooperating with other Persons, including Persons that may have interests
adverse to or otherwise compete, directly or indirectly, with the Companies or
Sellers (d) Buyers, Buyer Parent or their respective Affiliates are not
prohibited from discontinuing sales of, or reducing efforts to sell, any
product if Buyers determine, in good faith, that after giving effect to all
allocable costs and expenses such product line is no longer profitable (but
with regard to the E-Set Business and the Dissolvable Plugs Business only to
the extent consistent with clauses (i) and (ii) of the preceding sentence and
_Section 1.3.9_), (e) Buyers, Buyer Parent or their respective Affiliates
are not prohibited from liquidating, disposing of or otherwise distributing
any Company or all or any portion of its products, goods or assets (but with
regard to the E-Set Business and the Dissolvable Plugs Business only to the
extent consistent with clauses (i) and (ii) of the preceding sentence and
_Sections 1.3.9_, _1.3.12_ and _1.3.13_ ) and (f) the Parties intend for the
express provisions of this Section 1.3 to govern their relationship with
respect to the subject matter of this _Section 1.3_, which shall be a binding
contractual relationship, and no implied or other duty or obligation
(including any fiduciary duty or obligation or similar duty or obligation)
will apply to such relationship (and all such duties and obligations are
hereby expressly disclaimed and which will not give Sellers any dividend
rights, voting rights, liquidation rights, preemptive rights, or other rights
common to holders of equity securities or voting securities); _provided_ ,
_however_ , that nothing contained herein shall release a violation of the
implied contractual covenant of good faith and fair dealing. Until the end of
the Earnout Term and the final determination of the Earnout Statement with
respect to such Earnout Term (with respect to the E-Set Business) and the
Sales Earnout Period (with respect to the Dissolvable Plugs Business), except
as consented to in writing by Seller Representative, Buyers and Buyer Parent
(or their respective successors) shall, and shall cause the Companies (or
their respective successors) to, maintain adequate records of the E-Set
Business and the Dissolvable Plugs Business, on a stand-alone basis in
accordance with sound business practices, and such other records necessary or
advisable to allow for the calculation of each Earnout Payment, to enable the
Parties to calculate each Earnout Payment.

1.3.9. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in  _Section 1.3.8_, without
the written consent of Seller Representative (which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed) Buyers and Buyer Parent shall,
and shall cause the Companies to:

 

(a) cause to be expended or incurred at least $10,000,000 of capital
expenditures, as calculated in accordance with GAAP (and, for clarity, none
of which may

 



10

    

 be captured in the definition of Net Working Capital or Indebtedness for
purposes of any adjustment to the Purchase Price pursuant to _Section 1.2_),
for the purchase of tools to be used in the E-Set Business (including tools
manufactured by third parties utilizing the Companies Intellectual Property
Assets related to the E-Set Business) during the period from the Closing Date
to June 30, 2019, inclusive of such dates;

(b) prior to December 31, 2019, take commercially reasonable steps to
allocate no less than ten (10) employees who will devote all or substantially

the E-Set Business, including employees to serve in the following
positions/roles (or functional equivalents): Design Engineer, Project/Product
Sales Manager, Technical Advisors, eSet Product Technicians, eSet Field
Advisors, Product Developer, Buyer and Project/Product Cost Accountant;

(c) not dispose of any significant portion of the assets of the E-Set
Business or the Dissolvable Plugs Business, other than (1) sales of inventory
in the ordinary course of business of the Companies, (2) through dispositions
of worn-out, obsolete, excess or immaterial equipment or (3) in accordance
with _Sections 1.3.12_ or _1.3.13_ ; or

 

(d) not sell or rent products in the E-Set Business to (i) Buyer Parent or any
of its Affiliates, in each case, except on pricing terms applicable to the
E-Set Business which are no less favorable to the E-Set Business than would be
expected in an arms-length transaction, or (ii) to third parties in
combination with other products or services outside of the E-Set Business, in
each case, except on pricing terms applicable to the E-Set Business which are
no less favorable to the E-Set Business than would be expected in an arms-
length transaction involving only the sale or rental of products in the E-Set
Business.

1.3.10. During the Earnout Term (with respect to the E-Set Business) and Sales
Earnout Period (with respect to the Dissolvable Plugs Business), a joint
management committee (which shall be constituted of (i) Seller Representative
and one other of the Fraziers and (ii) two members of senior management
appointed by Buyers) (the " _Joint Management Committee_ ") shall meet at
least once every three months to (1) review the financial and operational
performance of the E-Set Business and the Dissolvable Plugs Business, (2)
discuss prospects, plans, budgets and other matters affecting the Earnout
Payments and the E-Set Business and the Dissolvable Plugs Business, as
applicable, and (3) if advisable, consult regarding the actions listed in
_Sections 1.3.8_ and _1.3.9_. For the sake of clarity, the Joint Management
Committee shall be consultative in nature and shall have no independent
authority. Buyers and Buyer Parent shall not be required to consult with or
obtain approval of the Joint Management Committee before taking or omitting
from taking any particular action; provided that Buyers and Buyer Parent
shall act in good faith to keep the members of the Joint Management Committee
reasonably informed at such meetings as to the actions, operations and
financial performance of the E-Set Business and the Dissolvable Plugs
Business and shall prepare and maintain minutes of the meetings of the Joint
Management Committee.

 

1.3.11. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, (i) Buyers
shall not be liable with respect to any claims (" _Capped Operational
Requirements Claims_ ")

 



11

    

 for Losses based upon, arising out of, with respect to or by reason of a
breach, other than any intentional or willful breach, by Buyer or Buyer Parent
of _Section 1.3.9_ in excess of a cap of $20,000,000 in the aggregate (the "
_Operational Requirements Cap_ ") and (ii) any claim for Losses based upon,
arising out of, with respect to or by reason of a breach, including any
intentional or willful breach, by Buyer or Buyer Parent or _Section 1.3.8_
or _Section 1.3.9_ (whether or not Capped Operational Requirements Claims)
must be asserted in good faith with reasonable specificity (to the extent
known as such time) and in writing by notice from Seller Representative to
Buyer Parent within two (2) year of such time as Seller Representative or
another member of the Fraziers became aware, or should have been reasonably
aware, of such breach or the basis therefor, otherwise after such time such
claims shall be barred and Buyer and Buyer Parent shall not have any further
obligation with respect thereto (aside from any such claims made in good faith
with reasonable specificity prior to the expiration of such survival
period which shall survive until finally resolved). For the avoidance of
doubt, any claims by Sellers relating to Losses arising under _Sections 1.3.1_
or _1.3.2_ that are not Capped Operational Requirement Claims shall not be
subject to the Operational Requirements Cap.

1.3.12. In connection with the consummation of any Change of Control Event or
any sale, transfer or other disposition, directly or indirectly (including by
operation of law or by the direct or indirect sale, exchange, or transfer of
equity interests in any subsidiary holding the E-Set Business the result of
which a Person other than Buyers, Buyer Parent or any of their respective
Affiliates owns or controls fifty percent (50%) or more of the voting
securities of any Person holding the E-Set Business) of all or substantially
all of the assets of the E-Set Business prior to the end of the Earnout Term,
Buyers shall be required, as a condition precedent to the consummation of such
transaction, except as otherwise consented to in writing by Seller
Representative, to cause the acquiring, continuing or surviving entity
immediately following such transaction to affirmatively assume the obligations
under this _Section 1.3_ relating to the E-Set Business.

1.3.13. In connection with the consummation of any Change of Control Event or
any sale, transfer or other disposition, directly or indirectly (including by

respective Affiliates owns or controls fifty percent (50%) or more of the
voting securities of any Person holding the Dissolvable Plugs Business) of all
or substantially all of the assets of the Dissolvable Plugs Business prior to
the end of the Sales Earnout Period, Buyers shall be required, as a condition
precedent to the consummation of such transaction, except as otherwise
consented to in writing by Seller Representative, to cause the acquiring,
continuing or surviving entity immediately following such transaction to
affirmatively assume the obligations under this _Section 1.3_ relating to the
Dissolvable Plugs Business.

 

1.3.14. All amounts paid pursuant to this _Section 1.3_ shall be deemed to be
adjustments to the Purchase Price for U.S. federal income Tax purposes,
except as otherwise required by applicable Law. For the avoidance of doubt,
all amounts paid pursuant to this _Section 1.3_ directly attributable to the
business of MOTC or other activities or operations of the Companies in Canada

12

    

 Canada Buyers purchase of the MOTC Shares and all other amounts paid

US Buyers purchase of the LP Interests and GP Securities.

SECTION 1.4 _Withholding_. Buyers are entitled to deduct and withhold from any
amounts payable pursuant to this Agreement any withholding of Taxes or other
amounts required under the Code or other applicable Law. To the extent that
any such amounts are so deducted or withheld, such amounts will be treated for
all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the Person in respect
of which such deduction and withholding was made. Except in the case of
amounts subject to withholding as a result of (x) any payment being treated as
compensation to the recipient or (y) a failure to deliver the certificates
contemplated by _Section 2.2.1_ _(c)_ , prior to deducting and withholding
any amounts pursuant to this _Section 1.4_, Buyers shall use commercially
reasonable efforts to notify the payee no later than ten (10) days prior to
payment thereof of any amounts that Buyers, or any other applicable
withholding agent on behalf of Buyers, intend to deduct or withhold from any
payments hereunder and provide the payee with reasonable support for
the basis on which Buyers, or other applicable withholding agent on behalf of
Buyers, intends to deduct or withhold under applicable Law. The Parties shall
cooperate with each other, as and to the extent reasonably requested by the
other Party, to minimize or eliminate any potential deductions and
withholdings that Buyers, or other applicable withholding agent on behalf of
Buyers, may believe it is required to make under applicable Law.

if an individual, has all necessary capacity, power and authority, to enter

_Section_ _ 5.10_ shall be limited to the amount of any liability or damage
that remains after deducting therefrom any insurance proceeds and any
indemnity, contribution or other similar payment received, reasonably expected
to be received by the Company Indemnified Party in respect of any such claim (
_plus_ (x) any reasonable out-of-pocket costs of collection or other
associated expenses in connection with asserting and collecting on such claim
and (y) any increases in premiums as a direct result of such claim) and (ii)
the Company Indemnified Parties shall not be entitled to indemnification,
advancement of expenses, exculpation or other limitations of liability with
respect to any Losses for which any Seller is required to indemnify any Buyer
Indemnified Party pursuant to _Section_ _ 7.2.1_. The Company Indemnified

insurance policies or indemnity, contribution or other similar agreements for
any Losses prior to seeking indemnification under this in this _Section_ _
5.10_.

SECTION 5.11 _Tax Matters_.

5.11.1. _Tax Treatment_. The Parties each hereby acknowledge and agree that,
pursuant to IRS Revenue Ruling 99-6, 1999-1 C.B. 432, the sale and purchase
of the LP Interests and GP Securities will constitute, (i) from Sellers
perspective, a purchase and sale of the LP Interests and the interests in
MOTI owned by the General Partner in accordance with Code Section 741, and
(ii) from US Buyers perspective, a purchase and sale of the assets of MOTI
(pursuant to Situation 2 of Revenue Ruling 99-6) for U.S. federal income Tax
purposes, including for purposes of Code Sections 1012 and 1060. The Parties
each further acknowledge and agree that they will file all Tax Returns in
accordance with this  _Section_ _ 5.11.1_, and will not make any
inconsistent statement or take any inconsistent position on any Tax Return, in
any refund claim, or during the course of any Tax Proceeding, except as
otherwise required pursuant to a "determination" within the meaning of
Section 1313(a) of the Code. Each Party will notify the other if it receives
notice that the Internal Revenue Service (or any other taxing authority)
proposes a treatment that is different from the treatment contemplated in
this _Section_ _ 5.11.1_; _provided_ , _however_ , that the Parties
acknowledge and agree that (x) nothing contained herein shall prevent any
Party from settling any proposed deficiency or adjustment by any Taxing
Authority based upon or arising out of the treatment of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, and (y) no Party or any of its Affiliates will
be obligated to litigate any challenge to the treatment contemplated in this
_Section 5.11.1_ by any Taxing Authority.

5.11.2. _Purchase Price Allocation_. The Purchase Price (and the amount of
any liability or other items required to be treated as purchase price for U.S.
federal income tax purposes) shall be allocated among the Assets as follows
for U.S. federal income tax purposes:

 

(a) Within ninety (90) calendar days after the final determination of the
Closing Statement pursuant to  _Section 1.2_, Buyers shall prepare and
deliver to the Seller Representative a proposed allocation of the portion of
the Purchase Price allocated to MOTI and the General Partner in accordance
with _Schedule 1.1_ (and the amount of any liability or other items required
to be treated as purchase price for U.S. federal income tax purposes) among
the Assets of MOTI and the General Partner (the " _Proposed Allocation_ ").
The Proposed Allocation shall be prepared in accordance with Code Section
1060 and the Treasury Regulations thereunder. Buyers shall provide the Seller
Representative with copies of such backup documentation and work papers
supporting the Proposed Allocation as the Seller Representative may
reasonably request.

(b) Within thirty (30) calendar days after delivery of the
Proposed Allocation, the Seller Representative will notify Buyers in writing
of any objections to the Proposed Allocation by setting forth in reasonable
detail the basis for any such objections (and any alternative allocation), and
including reasonable documentation supporting such objections (" _Allocation
Objection Notice_ "). If the Seller Representative either fails to provide an
Allocation Objection Notice to Buyers within such 30-day period, or provides
Buyers written notice of the Seller Representatives approval of the Proposed
Allocation within such 30-day period, the Seller Representative shall be
conclusively treated as having approved of the Proposed Allocation in
its entirety, and the Proposed Allocation thereafter shall be final and
binding on both Buyers and Sellers. In the event the Seller Representative
timely provides the Allocation Objection Notice to Buyers, Buyers and the
Seller Representative shall then use commercially reasonable efforts to
resolve their disagreements and agree upon a mutually acceptable allocation.
If Buyers and the Seller Representative are unable to agree upon a mutually
acceptable allocation within twenty (20) calendar days of Buyers receipt of
the Allocation Objection Notice, either Buyers or the Seller Representative
may thereafter refer the remaining disagreements under the Allocation
Objection Notice to the Accounting Firm for resolution in accordance with the
procedures set forth in _Section_ _ 1.2.5_ (and _Section 1.2.6_ with respect
to payment of the Accounting Firms fees and expenses), ___mutatis mutandis_
__; _provided_ , _however_ , that the Accounting Firm shall (A) make its
determination of the appropriate allocation based solely on substantiating
documentation submitted by Buyers and the Seller Representative ( _i.e._ , not
based on an independent review), and an analysis that is consistent with and
in accordance with the methodologies and principles contemplated in this
_Section 5.11.2_, and (B) be entitled to (i) review the books and records of
the Companies, and (ii) obtain such appraisals of any Assets as the
Accounting Firm determines is reasonably necessary for purposes of making its
determination hereunder.

 

(c) The Proposed Allocation as accepted or as finally agreed or determined
pursuant to this _Section 5.11.2_ will be the " _Final Allocation_ ". The
Parties will file all Tax Returns and related forms (including IRS Form 8594)
in accordance with the Final Allocation, and will not make any inconsistent
statement or take any inconsistent 

 



46

    

 position on any Tax Return or during the course of any Tax Proceeding,
except as otherwise required pursuant to a "determination" within the meaning
of Code Section 1313(a) (or the corresponding provision of any other
applicable Tax law). Each Party will notify the other if it receives notice
that the IRS proposes any allocation that is different from the Final
Allocation; _provided_ , _however_ , that neither Sellers, Buyers, nor any of
their respective Affiliates will be obligated to litigate any challenge to the
Final Allocation by the IRS (or any other Taxing Authority). The Parties
acknowledge and agree that (i) Buyers cost for the Assets may differ from
the total amount allocated under this _Section 5.11.2_ to reflect the
inclusion in the total cost of items (for example, capitalized acquisition
costs) not included in the amount so allocated, and (ii) the amount
realized by Sellers may differ from the total amount allocated under this
_Section 5.11.2_ to reflect transaction costs that reduce the amount realized
for federal income tax purposes.

 

(d) Buyers and Sellers shall allocate and report any adjustments to the
Purchase Price in accordance with Treasury Regulations Section 1.1060-1(e),
and any allocations made as a result of such adjustments shall become part of
the allocation contemplated in this _Section 5.11.2_. In the event that any
adjustment is required to be made to the allocation contemplated in this
_Section 5.11.2_ as a result of any adjustment to the Purchase Price pursuant
to this Agreement, Buyers shall prepare and deliver, or cause to be prepared
and delivered, to the Seller Representative, a revised allocation of the
Purchase Price reflecting such adjustment. Such revised allocation shall be
subject to the requirements of this _Section 5.11.2_ (including the review
and dispute resolution procedures set forth in subsection (b)), ___mutatis
mutandis_. __

5.11.3. _Tax Returns_. The preparation and filing of all Tax Returns by or on
behalf of any Company after the Closing shall be governed by the following
provisions:

(a) Seller Representative shall prepare, or cause to be prepared, and file,
or caused to be filed, all Tax Returns of the Companies that are filed on or
before the Closing Date. Seller Representative also shall prepare, or cause to
be prepared, and file, or caused to be filed, all Pass-Through Tax Returns of
the Companies for all Pre-Closing Tax Periods.

 

(b) Except as provided in _Section 5.11.3(a)_, Buyers shall prepare, or cause
to be prepared, and timely file, or caused to be filed, all Tax Returns of
the Companies for all Pre-Closing Tax Periods and Straddle Periods that are
filed or required to be filed after the Closing Date.

 

(c) Any Tax Returns prepared in accordance with this _Section 5.11.3_ shall
be prepared in a manner consistent with prior Tax Returns of the Companies
except as otherwise required by Law; provided, that the Parties agree to
allocate the deductions for the payments of the Closing Bonus Amounts to a
Pre-Closing Tax Period or the pre-Closing portion of any Straddle Period of
MOTI to the extent permitted by applicable Law. Reasonably in advance of
filing any such Tax Return, but no later than thirty (30) calendar days prior
to the due date (including extensions thereof) (the " _Due Date_ ") for the
filing of any such Tax Returns, the Party responsible for preparing such Tax
Return (the " _Preparing Party_ ") shall submit, or cause to be submitted, to
the other Party (the " _Reviewing Party_ ")

 



47

    

 for review, comment, and approval (such approval not to be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned, or delayed) a draft of such Tax Return. The Preparing
Party shall provide the Reviewing Party with copies of all backup
documentation and work papers supporting the preparation of such draft Tax
Returns as such Reviewing Party may reasonably request. The Reviewing Party
shall have twenty (20) calendar days following the date of delivery of the
draft Tax Return to notify the Preparing Party in writing of either (A) any
objection to such draft Tax Return or (B) Reviewing Partys approval of the
draft Tax Return. If the Reviewing Party fails to provide written notice
to the Preparing Party within such twenty (20) calendar day time period, the
Reviewing Party shall be conclusively treated as having approved of such Tax
Return for all purposes hereunder. In the event the Reviewing Party timely
notifies the Preparing Party of any objection with respect to a draft Tax
Return (" _Tax Objection Notice_ "), the Preparing Party shall consider in
good faith the Reviewing Partys comments to such draft Tax Return. The
Parties shall attempt in good faith to resolve all disputed items and
amounts. If the Parties are unable to resolve any disagreement within thirty
(30) calendar days of the Preparing Partys receipt of the Tax Objection
Notice, the unresolved disputes shall be referred to the Accounting Firm for
resolution in accordance with _Section 5.11.3(d)_; _provided_ , _however_ ,
that in the event that any disputed items cannot be resolved by the Due Date
for filing the applicable Tax Return, the applicable Tax Return shall be
filed by such Due Date reflecting Preparing Partys position with respect to
such disputed items and shall, if necessary, be amended promptly after
resolution of the dispute to reflect such resolution. The Preparing Party
shall deliver to the Reviewing Party a complete and accurate copy of each such
Tax Return prepared and filed pursuant to this _Section 5.11.3_ within
fifteen (15) calendar days of filing. For the avoidance of doubt, the Seller
Representative shall act on behalf of the Sellers with respect to any matters
(including all rights and obligations) governed by this _Section 5.11.3(c)_.

 

(d) Buyers and Seller Representative shall use commercially reasonable efforts
to cause the Accounting Firm to resolve all remaining disagreements
identified in any Tax Objection Notice as soon as practicable, but in any
event shall direct the Accounting Firm to render a written determination
within sixty (60) calendar days after its retention. The Accounting
Firm shall consider only those items and amounts (and any substantiating
documentation from Buyers and Seller Representative in connection therewith)
that are identified as the items in dispute. In resolving such disputed item,
the Parties will direct the Accounting Firm not to assign a value to any item
greater than the greatest value for such item claimed by either Party or less
than the smallest value for such item claimed by either Party. The Accounting
Firms determination of the disputed items shall be made based solely on
substantiating documentation submitted by Buyers and Seller Representative
(i.e., not on independent review), the applicable definitions set forth
herein, and an analysis that is consistent with and in accordance with the
methodologies and principles contemplated herein. The determination of the
Accounting Firm shall be final and binding upon Buyers and Sellers, and shall
not be subject to appeal or further review absent manifest error. The Parties
shall promptly comply with all reasonable requests by the Accounting Firm for
information, books, records and similar items. The costs and expenses of the
Accounting Firm shall be borne by Buyers, on the one hand, and Seller
Representative (on behalf of Sellers), on the other hand, based upon the
percentage that the portion of the contested amount not awarded to each Party
bears to the amount actually contested by such Party. For example, if Buyers
claim an deduction is $1,000 less than the

 



48

    

 amount determined by Seller Representative, and Seller Representative
contests only $500 of the amount claimed by Buyers, and if the Accounting Firm
ultimately resolves the dispute by awarding Buyers $300 of the $500
contested, then the costs and expenses of the Accounting Firm attributable to
such item will be allocated 60% ( _i.e._ , 300 ÷ 500) to Seller Representative
(on behalf of Sellers) and 40% ( _i.e._ , 200 ÷ 500) to Buyers.

(e) Sellers shall timely pay or cause to be paid to the appropriate Taxing
Authority an amount equal to the total liability for Taxes shown to be due
and payable on any Tax Return to be filed pursuant to _Section 5.11.3(a)_.
Buyers shall timely pay or cause to be paid to the appropriate Taxing
Authority an amount equal to the total liability for Taxes shown to be due
and payable on any Tax Return to be filed pursuant to _Section 5.11.3(b)_. In
connection with the filing of any such Tax Return by Buyers, Sellers shall pay
to Buyers an amount equal to the portion of the total liability for Taxes
shown to be due and payable on the Tax Return that constitutes Seller Taxes
within seven (7) calendar days after receiving notice from Buyers that payment
of such Taxes has either been made or will be made by Buyers or a Company
(but in no event any sooner than five (5) Business Days prior to the Due Date
for such Tax Return, except as Seller Representative otherwise decides in his
sole discretion).

 

(f) Unless otherwise required by applicable Law, Seller Representative will
not file or cause to be filed any amended Tax Returns for the Companies for
any Pre-Closing Tax Period or Straddle Period without the prior written
consent of Buyers, which consent will not be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned, or delayed. Unless otherwise required by applicable Law, Buyers
will not file or cause or allow to be filed any amended Tax Returns for the
Companies for any Pre-Closing Tax Period or Straddle Period if such action
could result in the increase of any Tax liability for the Sellers or result
in an indemnification claim against Sellers pursuant to _Section 7.2.1_
without the prior written consent of Seller Representative, which consent will
not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned, or delayed.

5.11.4. _Transfer Taxes_. All Transfer Taxes shall be borne by Buyers. Except
as otherwise required by Law, Buyers shall, at their own expense, timely
prepare and file or cause to be timely prepared and filed any Tax Return or
other documentation with respect to Transfer Taxes, and pay or cause to be
paid the full amount of all Transfer Taxes due with respect thereto.

5.11.5. _Cooperation_. With respect to all Pre-Closing Tax Periods and
Straddle Periods, until expiration of the statutes of limitation (including,
to the extent notified by Seller Representative or Buyers, any extensions
thereof) applicable thereto, each of Sellers and Buyers will, and will cause
each of its Affiliates to, provide the other with such assistance, cooperation
and information as may reasonably be requested by any of them in connection
with the preparation of any Tax Return, determining a liability for Taxes or
a right to a refund of Taxes, or contesting any Tax Proceeding, but only with
respect to Tax Returns or Taxes imposed upon or related to the Companies, the
Assets, or the Business. Such cooperation and information shall include
providing copies of relevant Tax Returns or portions thereof, together with
accompanying schedules, related work papers and documents relating to rulings
or other determinations by any Taxing Authority. Each of 

 



49

    

 Sellers and Buyers shall, and shall cause each of their Affiliates to, make
their respective Representatives and agents available on a basis mutually
convenient to the other Party to provide explanations of any documents or
information provided hereunder. Each of Sellers and Buyers shall retain all
Tax Returns, schedules and work papers, records and other documents in its
possession relating to Tax matters of the Assets or the Business for all Tax
periods beginning on or before the Closing Date until the expiration of the
statute of limitations of the Tax periods to which such Tax Returns and other
documents relate (and, to the extent notified by Seller Representative or
Buyers, any extensions thereof); _provided_ , _however_ , that all such
foregoing items shall be retained for a minimum of six (6) years from the
respective dates on which Tax Returns are filed for all Pre-Closing Tax
Periods and Straddle Periods. Notwithstanding anything in the Agreement to the
contrary, in case of any conflict between this _Section 5.11.5_ and _Section
5.13_ with respect to any Tax matters, this _Section 5.11.5_ shall govern
with respect to such Tax matters.

5.11.6.  _Refunds and Credits_. Any refund of Taxes received by Buyers or any
Company (or any of their respective Affiliates), and any amounts credited
against Taxes to which Buyers or any Company (or any of their respective
Affiliates) would otherwise be required pay, after the Closing Date shall be
solely for the account of (a) Sellers to the extent constituting or arising
from Seller Taxes (and neither Buyers nor any of their Affiliates at such
time, including any Company, shall have any interest therein); provided, that
the amount of any such refund or credit that is for the account of Sellers
shall be reduced by any reasonable costs and expenses (including Taxes)
actually paid or incurred by Buyers or any Company (or any of
their respective Affiliates) in connection with obtaining such refund or
credit, and (b) solely for the account of Buyers to the extent constituting or
arising from Taxes other than Seller Taxes (and no Seller nor any of their
Affiliates at such time shall have any interest therein). For the avoidance
of doubt, the provisions of this _Section 5.11.6_ shall not apply to any
amount that (x) was taken into account for purposes of determining Final Net
Working Capital or (y) arises as the result of a carryback of a loss or other
Tax benefit from a Tax period (or portion thereof) beginning on or after the
Closing Date.

 

5.11.7. _Wage Reporting_. To the extent applicable, Buyers will use, and will
cause its Affiliates (including, from and after the Effective Time, each
Company) to use, the Alternative Procedure set forth in Revenue Procedure
2004-53 with respect to wage reporting for wages paid during calendar year
2018.

 

5.11.8. _Tax Proceedings_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this
Agreement, all Tax Proceedings relating to a Pass-Through Income Tax Matter
with respect to any Pre-Closing Tax Period shall be controlled by Sellers;
_provided_ , _however_ , that Buyers shall be kept reasonably informed with
respect to such Tax Proceeding and no such Tax Proceeding that could result
in any Tax liability for Buyers or any Company shall be settled without the
prior written consent of Buyers, such consent not to be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned, or delayed. All other Tax Proceedings shall be controlled by
Buyers; _provided_ , _however_ , that with respect to any Tax Proceeding
relating to (i) a Pass-Through Income Tax Matter with respect to any Straddle
Period or (ii) any other Taxes for which Sellers may have an indemnity
obligation pursuant to _Section 7.3.1_, Buyers shall (A) keep the Seller
Representative reasonably informed with respect to such Tax

 



50

    

 Proceeding, (B) provide the Seller Representative with copies of all
correspondence, notices, and other written material received from, or provided
by Buyers to, any Taxing Authority with respect to such Tax Proceeding, (C)
provide the Seller Representative with a copy of all written submissions
proposed to be made to a Taxing Authority in connection with such Tax
Proceeding reasonably in advance of submission, and consider in good faith
any reasonable comments from the Seller Representative with respect to such
submissions prior to filing, (D) allow the Seller Representative to designate
a representative to participate in any meetings or telephone conferences
with any Taxing Authority, and (E) not settle any such Tax Proceeding that
could result in any Tax liability, or indemnification obligation hereunder,
for Sellers without the prior written consent of the Seller Representative,
such consent not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned, or delayed.
Notwithstanding anything in the Agreement to the contrary, in case of any
conflict between this _Section 5.11.8_ and _Section 7.7_ with respect to any
Tax Proceedings, this  _Section 5.11.8_ shall govern with respect to such
Tax Proceeding.

SECTION 5.12 _Further Assurances_. Following the Closing, each of the Parties
shall, and shall cause their respective Affiliates to, execute and deliver
such additional documents, instruments, conveyances and assurances and take
such further actions as may be reasonably required to carry out
the provisions hereof and give effect to the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement and the other Transaction Documents. The Parties will cooperate
on the preparation and delivery of the notices set forth on _Section 3.5_ of
the Seller Disclosure Schedules promptly after the date hereof. Prior to the
Closing, the Seller Representative and Buyers each shall give prompt notice to
the other of any development or combination of developments that, individually
or in the aggregate, is reasonably likely to prevent, materially delay or
materially impair its ability to consummate the transactions contemplated by
any of the Transaction Documents. Without limiting the foregoing, (i) Seller
Representative shall give notice to Buyers as promptly as reasonably
practicable upon becoming aware of any fact, change, condition, event,
occurrence or non-occurrence that if it occurred or was continuing as of the
Closing Date would result in a failure of a condition set forth in _Section
6.1_ or _6.2_ or the institution of, or the threat of institution of, any
actions, suits, claims, investigations or other legal proceedings against any
of Sellers or the Companies relating to the Transaction Documents or the
transactions contemplated hereby or thereby and (ii) Buyers shall give notice
to Seller Representative as promptly as reasonably practicable upon becoming
aware of any fact, change, condition, event, occurrence or non-occurrence
that if it occurred or was continuing as of the Closing Date would result in a
failure of a condition set forth in _Section 6.1_ or _6.3_ or the institution
of, or the threat of institution of, any actions, suits, claims,
investigations or other legal proceedings against Buyers relating to the
Transaction Documents or the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby.

 

SECTION 5.13 _Documents and Information_. After the Effective Time, Buyers
shall, until the seventh (7th) anniversary of the Closing Date, and subject to
reasonable and appropriate document retention policies, use commercially
reasonable efforts to retain all material books and records pertaining to the
portion of the Business conducted by the Companies delivered to the possession
of Buyers and the Companies on the Closing Date and make the same available
for inspection and copying by Seller Representative (or, alternatively, at a
Seller Representatives request, delivered in electronic form to the extent
reasonably available) at Sellers expense during normal business hours of the
applicable Company, upon reasonable request and upon reasonable advance
notice, under supervision of the Companies personnel and in such manner as
not to

 



51

    

 interfere with the conduct of the Business. Each Seller acknowledges and
agrees that from and after the Effective Time, Buyers will be entitled to the
originals of all books and records of the Companies and that the Sellers will
promptly deliver to Buyers such originals of all books and records and will
cooperate with Buyers in the preparation and/or audit of historical
financial statements for the Business for such periods as may be reasonably
requested by Buyers; provided, however, that Seller may remove from the
Companies facilities and Computer Systems (a) all information prepared by the
Companies, Sellers or their representatives or advisors to the extent
relating to, and any bids received from others in connection with, any sales
process involving a sale of the Companies, the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement and all information and analysis (including financial
analysis) prepared in furtherance of such process or bids and (b) all books
and records of the Sellers or their Affiliates, to the extent not relating to
the Companies or their Assets or operations (collectively, the " _Excluded
Information_ ").

SECTION 5.14 _Attorney Conflicts and Privilege Matters_.

 

5.14.1. _Right to Represent; Waiver of Conflict_. Buyers (for and on behalf of
themselves and, with respect to the post-Closing period, each Company) and
Buyer Parent each hereby agrees that, notwithstanding any current or prior
representation of Sellers, the Companies, or any of their respective
Affiliates by Porter Hedges LLP ("PH"), PH is hereby allowed to represent
each Seller or any of their Affiliates in any matters and disputes (or any
other matters) that relate in any manner to this Agreement or any of the
transactions contemplated hereby, including any disputes or matters adverse
to Buyers, Buyer Parent, any Company, or any of their respective Affiliates,
and regardless of whether such dispute or matter is one with respect to which
PH may have previously advised Sellers or the Companies or that is in
existence on the date hereof or may arise in the future. Buyers (for and on
behalf of themselves and, with respect to the post-Closing period, each
Company) and Buyer Parent each hereby waives any claim they have or may have
that PH has a conflict of interest or is otherwise prohibited from engaging
in any such representation.

5.14.2. _Seller Representative Holds Privilege_. From and after the Effective
Time, (a) Seller Representative shall be the sole holder of (with the sole
power and authority to claim and enforce, including on behalf of any Company)
the attorney-client privilege regarding any communications associated with
the engagement of PH by Sellers and Companies related in any manner to this
Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated hereby, and neither Buyers,
Buyer Parent, any Company, any of their Affiliates, nor any of their
respective officers, directors, or other representatives shall be a holder
thereof (and shall have no power to claim or enforce any right with respect
thereto); provided, however, that the Companies shall also, along with Seller
Representative, hold such attorney-client privilege with regard to any
action, suit, claim or other legal proceeding made or brought by a third party
(with the power and authority to claim and enforce such attorney-client
privilege), (b) to the extent that files of PH in respect of such engagement
constitute property of any Company as the client, only Seller Representative,
and none of Buyers, Buyer Parent, any Company, their Affiliates, nor their
representative officers, directors, or other representatives, shall hold such
property rights, and (c) PH shall have no duty whatsoever to reveal or
disclose any such attorney-client communications or files to Buyers, Buyer
Parent, any Company, their Affiliates, or their representative officers,
directors, or other representatives.

 



52

    

5.14.3. _Covenant Not to Assert_. Buyers (for and on behalf of themselves
and, with respect to the post-Closing period, each Company) and Buyer Parent
each hereby agrees that Buyers and Buyer Parent shall not assert and, from and
after the Effective Time, Buyers and Buyer Parent will cause each Company
and their respective representatives and Affiliates to refrain from
asserting, any claim against PH in respect of legal services provided to any
Company by PH with respect to the Transaction Documents or any transactions
contemplated thereby.

 

5.14.4. _No Continuing Relationship_. From and after the Effective Time, the
Companies will no longer have any attorney-client relationship with PH unless
PH is specifically engaged in writing by a Company to represent the Company
after the Closing Date and either the representation involves no conflict of
interest with respect to any Seller or the applicable Seller consents in
writing to such engagement. Any such representation will not affect the rights
and benefits provided in this _Section 5.14_.

 

5.14.5. _This Section Irrevocable_. The rights, benefits, and waivers granted
under this _Section 5.14_ are irrevocable, and no term or condition hereof
may be amended, waived or modified without the prior written consent of PH.

SECTION 5.15  _Seller Representative_.

5.15.1. _Appointment and Authority_. Each Seller hereby irrevocably appoints
the Seller Representative as such Seller Representative, attorney-in-fact and

act, consent or instruction from the Seller Representative hereunder
shall constitute a decision, act, consent or instruction of all Sellers and
shall be final, binding and conclusive upon each Seller, and Buyers may rely
upon any such decision, act, consent or instruction the Seller Representative
as being the decision, act, consent or instruction of each and every Seller.
Buyers shall be relieved from any liability to any Person for any acts done by
them in accordance with, pursuant to or in reliance on any such decision, act,
consent or instruction of the Seller Representative.

5.15.4. _No Liability_. The Seller Representative will not be liable to any
Seller for any action taken by the Seller Representative in subjective good
faith pursuant to this _Section 5.15_, and each Seller will indemnify (but
only to the extent of the Sellers pro rata share of any liability) the Seller
Representative from any Losses arising out of its serving

 as the Seller Representative hereunder. The Seller Representative is serving
in that capacity solely for purposes of administrative convenience, and is not
personally liable in such capacity for any of the indemnification obligations
to be funded by the Sellers and each of the Indemnified Parties agrees that it
will not look to the personal assets of the Seller Representative, acting in
such capacity, for the satisfaction of any obligations under this Agreement
or otherwise related to the transactions contemplated hereby, including
obligations to be funded by the Sellers.

 

5.15.5. _Access to Information_. Prior to the Closing, the Seller
Representative shall have reasonable access to information about Company and

confidentially).

 

5.15.6. _Indemnification_. Sellers shall, jointly and severally, indemnify the
Seller Representative for, and will hold the Seller Representative harmless
against, any loss, liability or expense incurred without willful misconduct or
bad faith on the part of the Seller Representative, arising out of or in
connection with the Seller Representatives carrying out its duties under
this Agreement or any other Transaction Document, including the costs and
expenses of successfully defending the Seller Representative against any claim
of liability with respect thereto. The Seller Representative may consult
with counsel or advisors of his own choice and will have full and complete
authorization and protection for any action taken or suffered by him in good
faith and in accordance with the opinion of such counsel. Further in this
regard, for the avoidance of doubt, the Seller Representative shall have the
authority, in his sole and absolute discretion, to incur out-of-pocket fees,
costs and expenses in connection with the performance of its duties
hereunder, including reasonable fees and expenses of legal counsel,
accountants, investment bankers or other advisors, and to the advancement or

THE INDEMNIFICATION OBLIGATIONS PROVIDED IN THIS _SECTION 5.15_ ARE INTENDED
TO BE ENFORCEABLE AGAINST SELLERS IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE EXPRESS TERMS AND
SCOPE HEREOF NOTWITHSTANDING THE EXPRESS NEGLIGENCE OR ANY OTHER SIMILAR RULE
OF TEXAS, OR ANY OTHER STATE, THAT WOULD PROHIBIT OR OTHERWISE LIMIT
INDEMNIFICATION OBLIGATIONS BECAUSE OF THE SIMPLE NEGLIGENCE (WHETHER SOLE,
CONCURRENT, ACTIVE OR PASSIVE) OR OTHER FAULT OR STRICT LIABILITY OF ANY OF
THE SELLER REPRESENTATIVE. ACCORDINGLY THE INDEMNIFICATION PROVIDED HEREUNDER
SHALL APPLY TO MATTERS THAT ARISE OUT OF THE NEGLIGENCE, STRICT LIABILITY, OR
OTHER FAULT OR RESPONSIBILITY BY THE SELLER REPRESENTATIVE; _PROVIDED_ ,
_HOWEVER_ , THAT THE INDEMNIFICATION PROVIDED HEREUNDER SHALL NOT APPLY TO
MATTERS ARISING OUT OF THE GROSS NEGLIGENCE, WILLFUL MISCONDUCT, OR WILLFUL
BREACH OF THIS AGREEMENT BY THE SELLER REPRESENTATIVE. THE PARTIES AGREE THAT
THIS PROVISION IS "CONSPICUOUS" FOR PURPOSES OF TEXAS AND ALL OTHER STATE
LAWS.

will be effective upon the later of the date indicated in the notice or the
date such notice is received by Buyers.

 

SECTION 5.16 _Buyer Parent Guaranty_. Buyer Parent hereby, unconditionally and
irrevocably, guarantees (this " _Buyer Parent Guaranty_ "), by way of an

Buyers to Sellers under or arising out of this Agreement and the other
Transaction Documents; and (ii) the due and punctual payment of all amounts
due and payable by Buyers to Sellers under or arising out of this Agreement
and the other Transaction Documents after the date hereof, when and as the

Transaction Documents (the " _Guaranteed Obligations_ "). Buyer Parent
guarantees as principal obligor and not as surety the prompt performance and
payment of all Guaranteed Obligations, this being a guarantee of payment and
not a guarantee of collection. This Buyer Parent Guaranty is not contingent
upon the pursuit by Sellers of any rights or remedies against Buyers, such
pursuit being hereby waived by Buyer Parent. The obligations, covenants,
agreements and duties of Buyer Parent hereunder shall not be released,
affected or impaired in any way by the voluntary or involuntary liquidation,
sale or disposition of any assets of Buyers, or the merger or consolidation of
Buyers with any other Person. This Buyer Parent Guaranty shall be binding upon
all successors and assigns of Buyer Parent. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary in this Agreement, this Buyer Parent Guaranty shall automatically
terminate, solely as to the Guaranteed Obligations arising under or relating
to _Section 1.3_ with respect to the E-Set Earnout Payments and E-Set
Business and operation thereof and/or Sales Earnout Payments and Dissolvable

Buyer or Buyer Parent if such acquiring, continuing or surviving entity and,
if applicable, the ultimate controlling operating company parent (which shall
not need to include, for clarity, a private equity or other investment fund
or sponsor) of such entity, affirmatively assumes the obligations of Buyers
under _Section 1.3_ with respect to the E-Set Earnout Payments and E-Set
Business and operation thereof and/or Sales Earnout Payments and Dissolvable
Plugs Business and operation thereof (as applicable), in a signed undertaking
delivered to Seller Representative.

5.20.3. To the extent that any part of this _Section 5.20_ may be invalid,
illegal or unenforceable for any reason, it is intended that such part shall
be enforceable to the extent that a court of competent jurisdiction shall
determine that such part, if more limited in scope, would have been
enforceable, such part shall be deemed to have been so written and the

61

    

 intended to comply with all applicable Laws. Each Restricted Party

breach or threatened breach of any of the provisions of this _Section 5.20_,

remedies available to it under this Agreement, at law or in equity, for any

the applicable terms of this _Section 5.20_. The Restricted Parties
acknowledge that the geographic scope and duration of the applicable covenants
contained in this  _Section 5.20_ are the result of arms length bargaining
and are fair and reasonable in light of (i) the nature and wide geographic
scope of the operations of the Business (as applicable), (ii) the Restricted
Parties level of control over, contact with, and association with the
goodwill of, the Business (as applicable) in all jurisdictions in which it is
conducted, (iii) the fact that the Business (as applicable) is conducted by
the Companies throughout the US Restricted Area and Canada Restricted Area
(as applicable), and (iv) the consideration that Sellers (as applicable) are
receiving in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
and the amount of goodwill for which Buyers are paying (as applicable). It is
the desire and intent of the Parties that the provisions of this Agreement be
enforced to the fullest extent permitted under applicable Law, whether now or
hereafter in effect and therefore, to the extent permitted by applicable Law,
the parties waive any provision of applicable Law that would render any
provision of this _Section 5.20_ invalid or unenforceable.

 

5.20.7. Warren Frazier acknowledges and agrees that he is associated with the
goodwill of MOTC and that Warren Fraziers agreement to the applicable
restrictions in this _Section 5.20.2_ is a material inducement for Canada
Buyer and Buyer Parent to enter into this Agreement. The parties intend that
the conditions set forth in subsection 56.4(7) of the  __Income Tax Act
__(Canada) (the " _Tax Act_ ") (and the equivalent provisions of any
applicable provincial Tax legislation) have been met such that subsection
56.4(5) of the Tax Act (and the equivalent provisions of any applicable
provincial Tax legislation) applies to any "restrictive covenants" (as defined
in subsection 56.4(1) of the Tax Act) granted by Warrant Frazier pursuant to
this Section 5.20.2 (the " _Warren Restrictive Covenants_ "). For greater
certainty, the parties hereto agree and acknowledge that: (i) for the purposes
of the Tax Act, no part of the consideration payable to Warrant Frazier under
this Agreement is allocable to, and no proceeds are receivable by Warrant
Frazier for granting, the Warren Restrictive Covenants, (ii) the Warren
Restrictive Covenants are integral to the Agreement and have been granted to
maintain or preserve the fair market value of the MOTC Shares and (iii) the
Warren Restrictive Covenants meet the requirements specified in clause
56.4(7)(b)(ii)(B) of the Tax Act.

through (ii) of this  _Section 5.23.2_; or (iv) intentionally publicly
disclose any intention, plan or arrangement inconsistent with any provisions
of this _Section 5.23.2_; _provided_ , _however_ , that, for the avoidance of
doubt, nothing in this _Section 5.23.2_ will limit (A) any Sellers or any
Fraziers (or their respective Affiliates or Representatives) ability to
transfer or vote its Buyer Parent Common Stock, including to vote for, vote
against or abstain from voting, in their sole and absolute discretion, on any
proposal submitted to stockholders, including with respect to any
extraordinary transaction involving Buyer Parent or any of its subsidiaries or
any of their securities or assets, but without limiting the obligations set
forth in clauses (i)-(iv) above, (B) the ability of any Seller or any Frazier
(or their respective Affiliates or Representatives) to assert or protect their

breach or threatened breach of any of the provisions of this _Section 5.23_,
US Buyer or Canada Buyer, as applicable, and Buyer Parent shall be entitled to
immediate injunctive relief, as any such breach would cause US Buyer or
Canada Buyer, as applicable, and Buyer Parent irreparable injury for which
they would have no adequate remedy at law. Nothing herein shall be construed
so as to prohibit Buyers and Buyer Parent from pursuing or realizing any other
remedies available to it under this Agreement, at law or in equity, for any
such breach or threatened breach.

reimburse the Companies, Buyer Parent and their Affiliates for any third
party, out-of-pocket costs incurred by such Company, Buyer Parent or Affiliate

not include compensation and benefits paid by such Company, Buyer Parent or
Affiliate to the Designate Employees.

specificity prior to expiration of such time period).

 

7.3.5. _Post-Closing Events_. No Buyer Indemnified Party shall be entitled to
recover under this _Article 7_ with respect to any Losses (a) arising solely

be limited to the amount of any liability or damage that remains after
deducting therefrom any insurance proceeds and any indemnity, contribution or
other similar payment received or reasonably expected to be received by the
Indemnified Party in respect of any such claim (plus (i) any reasonable out-
of-pocket costs of collection or other associated reasonable out-of-pocket
expenses in connection with asserting and collecting on such claim and (ii)
any increases in premiums as a direct result of such claim for one year

indemnity, contribution or other similar agreements for any Losses prior to
seeking indemnification under this Agreement.

7.5.2. [ _Reserved_.]

 

7.5.3. _No Punitive, Exemplary or Certain Other Damages_. Notwithstanding any
other provision of this Agreement, no Indemnified Party shall be entitled to
any special, consequential (other than diminution in value to the extent such

remote, speculative, indirect, punitive damages or exemplary damages suffered
by an Indemnified Party except for any such damages which are the reasonable
and foreseeable result of the breach or actually paid or payable to a third
party pursuant to any claim made by such third party.

 

7.5.4. _Duty to Mitigate_. Each Indemnified Party shall use, and cause its
Affiliates to use, commercially reasonable efforts to mitigate any Loss upon

extent necessary to remedy the breach that gives rise to such Loss.
Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, no Indemnified Party shall be
entitled to be compensated for any matter which was accounted for in the final
determination of the Net Adjustment Amount or be compensated more than once
for the same claim under this _Article 7_.

7.5.5. [ _Reserved_.]

 

7.5.6. [ _Reserved_.]

 

7.5.7. _Subrogation_. The Indemnifying Party shall be subrogated to the rights
of the Indemnified Party in respect of any insurance (other than self-

is an Affiliate of any Party) relating to any indemnified Losses to the extent
of any indemnification payments made hereunder, and the Indemnified Party
shall provide all reasonably requested assistance to the Indemnifying Party in
respect of such subrogation, including executing any instrument reasonably
necessary to evidence such subrogation rights.

 



70

    

SECTION 7.6 _Indemnification Procedures  Direct Claims_.

 

7.6.1. _Notice of Claim_. Any claim for indemnification hereunder against any
Indemnifying Party by an Indemnified Party on account of a Loss that does not
result from a Third Party Claim (a " _Direct Claim_ ") shall be asserted
promptly after the Indemnified Party becomes aware of such claim by written
notice thereof to the Indemnifying Party;  _provided_ , _however_ , that the
failure to give such prompt written notice shall not relieve the Indemnifying
Party of its indemnification obligations hereunder except to the extent that
the Indemnifying Party suffers actual and material loss or prejudice as a
result of such failure. Such notice by the Indemnified Party shall (i)
describe the nature and basis for the Direct Claim in reasonable detail, (ii)
indicate the amount or estimated amount, if reasonably practicable, of the
Loss that has been or may be sustained by the Indemnified Party, (iii)
identify each provision of this Agreement under which the claim is made, (iv)
include copies of all material written evidence and correspondence thereof or
with respect thereto, (v) describe all claims, and the status of such claims,
if any, for insurance coverage as contemplated in _Section 7.5.1_ and (vi)
describe what actions, if any, the Indemnified Party has taken to mitigate
any asserted Loss as contemplated in _Section 7.5.4_. The Indemnified Party
shall provide to the Indemnifying Party copies of any documentation supporting
the Direct Claim that is in the Indemnified Partys possession promptly
following the delivery of the foregoing notice (or coming into possession of
such documentation following delivery of the foregoing notice).

 

7.6.2. _Procedure for Resolution of Claim_. The Indemnifying Party shall have
twenty (20) Business Days after its receipt of such notice to respond in
writing to such Direct Claim. During such twenty (20) Business Day period, the
Indemnified Party shall allow the Indemnifying Party and its professional
advisors to investigate the matter or circumstance alleged to give rise to
the Direct Claim, and whether and to what extent any amount is payable in
respect of the Direct Claim. The Indemnified Party shall assist the
Indemnifying Partys investigation by giving such information and
assistance (including access to the Indemnified Partys premises and
personnel and the right to examine and copy any accounts, documents or
records) as the Indemnifying Party or any of its professional advisors may
reasonably request. If the Indemnified Party fails to provide such foregoing
assistance, the Indemnified Party hereby acknowledges and agrees that the
Indemnified Party shall not be entitled to admit the testimony of any
personnel to whom such access was not given or the information reflected in
any account, document, or record to which access for examination was not
provided as evidence in any mediation, arbitration, hearing, trial or other
proceeding with respect to the Direct Claim. If the Indemnifying Party timely
responds, the Indemnified Party and Indemnifying Party shall proceed in good
faith to negotiate a resolution of such dispute and, if not resolved after
such twenty (20) Business Day period (or such longer period as mutually
agreed) through negotiations, the Indemnified Party shall be free to pursue
such remedies as may be available, subject to the provisions of this
Agreement. If the Indemnifying Party does not so respond within such twenty
(20) Business Day period, the Indemnifying Party shall be deemed to have
rejected such claim, in which case the Indemnified Party shall be free to
pursue such remedies as may be available to the Indemnified Party on the terms
and subject to the provisions of this Agreement.

 



71

    

SECTION 7.7 _Indemnification Procedures  Third Party Claims_.

 

7.7.1. _Notice of Claims_. Any Indemnified Party wishing to assert a right to
indemnification under this Agreement against an Indemnifying Party with
respect to any action, suit, claim or other legal proceeding made or brought
against such Indemnified Party by any Person who is neither a Party, an
Affiliate of a Party, nor a Representative of any of the foregoing (a "
_Third Party Claim_ ") shall give the Indemnifying Party written notice
thereof promptly after receiving notice of the assertion or commencement of
the Third Party Claim; _provided_ , _however_ , that the failure to give
such prompt written notice shall not relieve the Indemnifying Party of its
indemnification obligations hereunder except to the extent that the
Indemnifying Party can demonstrate actual material loss or prejudice as a
result of such failure. Such notice by the Indemnified Party shall (i)
describe the nature and basis for the Third Party Claim in reasonable detail,
(ii) indicate the amount or estimated amount, if reasonably practicable, of
the Loss that has been or may be sustained by the Indemnified Party, (iii)
identify each provision of this Agreement under which the claim of right to
indemnification is made, (iv) include copies of all material written evidence
and correspondence thereof or with respect thereto, (v) describe all claims,
and the status of such claims, if any, for insurance coverage as contemplated
in _Section_ _ 7.5.1_, and (vi) describe what actions, if any, the
Indemnified Party has taken to mitigate any asserted Loss as contemplated in
_Section_ _ 7.5.4_. The Indemnified Party shall provide to the Indemnifying
Party copies of any documentation supporting the Third Party Claim that is in
the Indemnified Partys possession (including with respect to any Tax
matters, copies of any notices or correspondence received by the Indemnified
Party from, or sent by the Indemnified Party to, any Taxing Authority)
promptly following the delivery of the foregoing notice (or coming into
possession of such documentation following delivery of the foregoing notice).
For the avoidance of doubt, this _Section_ _ 7.7.1_ shall apply with respect
to any Third Party Claim related to Taxes.

 

7.7.2. _Control of Third Party Claim Defense_. The Indemnifying Party shall
have the right to assume and control the defense of any Third Party Claim at
the Indemnifying Partys expense, and with counsel of the Indemnifying Partys
own choosing, by giving written notice to the Indemnified Party promptly after
receipt by the Indemnifying Party of the notice contemplated in _Section
7.7.1_ that it is assuming such defense and that it believes, in good faith,
that if the facts alleged in such Third Party Claim were determined to be
correct, it could reasonably be expected have an obligation to indemnify the
Indemnified Party with respect to all or part of such Third Party Claim;
_provided_ , _however_ , that any Third Party Claim relating to Taxes shall be
governed exclusively by _Section 5.11.8_. In the event that the Indemnifying
Party assumes the defense of any Third Party Claim, subject to _Section
7.7.3_, the Indemnifying Party shall have the right to take such action as it
deems necessary or appropriate to avoid, dispute, defend, appeal, make
counterclaims pertaining to, pay, settle, or compromise the Third Party Claim,
including in the name and on behalf of the Indemnified Party. The Indemnified
Party shall have the right, at its own cost and expense, to participate in
the defense of any Third Party Claim with counsel selected by it subject to
the Indemnifying Partys right to control the defense

 



72

    

 thereof. If the Indemnifying Party elects not to assume and control the
defense of a Third Party Claim (including by failing to notify the Indemnified
Party in writing of its election to defend as provided in this _Section
7.7.2_), the Indemnified Party may, subject to _Section 7.7.3_, take such
action as it deems necessary or appropriate to avoid, dispute, defend, appeal,
make counterclaims pertaining to, pay, settle, or compromise such Third Party
Claim, and seek indemnification for any and all Losses based upon, arising
from or relating to such Third Party Claim; _provided_ , _however_ , that the
Indemnifying Party shall have the right to participate in the defense of the
Third Party Claim with counsel of its own choosing and at Indemnifying Partys
sole expense, subject to the Indemnified Partys right to control the defense
thereof. Sellers and Buyers shall cooperate with each other in all reasonable
respects in connection with the defense of any Third Party Claim, including
making available (subject to the provisions of _Section_ _ 5.4_) records
relating to such Third Party Claim and furnishing, without expense (other
than reimbursement of actual out-of-pocket expenses) to the defending party,
management employees of the non-defending party as may be reasonably
necessary for the preparation of the defense of such Third Party Claim.
Notwithstanding anything in this _Section 7.7.2_ to the contrary: (i) Buyers
shall in all cases be entitled to control the defense of a Third Party Claim
if Buyers reasonably believe such Third Party Claim could result in Losses
which, taken together with other then outstanding claims by Buyers under this
Agreement, could exceed the remaining potential damages payable by the
Sellers under this Agreement or the amount that Buyers reasonably believe
they will be able to collect from the Sellers under this Agreement; and (ii)
the Indemnified Party shall in all cases be entitled to control the defense of
a Third Party Claim if the Indemnifying Party fails to diligently prosecute
such Third Party Claim or the Indemnified Partys outside counsel will have
reasonably concluded and advised in writing (with a copy to the Indemnifying
Party) that (A) such Third Party Claim could adversely affect in any material
respect the Indemnified Party or its Affiliates other than as a result of
money damages or if injunctive or other non-monetary relief has been sought
against the Indemnified Party or its Affiliates, (B) the Third Party Claim
relates to or arises in connection with any criminal proceeding against the
Indemnified Party, (C) a conflict or potential conflict exists between the
Indemnified Party and the Indemnifying Party (other than as a result of a
claim for indemnification hereunder), or (D) such defense involves defenses of
the Indemnified Party that are inconsistent with those available to the
Indemnifying Party;  __ _provided_ __, that the Indemnifying Party shall have
the right, at its own expense, to participate with the Indemnified Party in
the defense of any such Third Party Claim.

 

7.7.3. _Settlement of Third Party Claims_. Notwithstanding any other provision
of this Agreement to the contrary, neither the Indemnifying Party nor the
Indemnified Party will settle or compromise any Third Party Claim without the
prior written consent of the other ( _i.e._ , either the Indemnified Party or
Indemnifying Party, as appropriate), which consent shall not be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned, or delayed, except under circumstances in which the
settlement or compromise includes an unqualified release of all liability
associated with the Third Party Claim. If the Indemnified Party fails to
consent within seven (7) Business Days after receiving notice from the
Indemnifying Party of the Indemnifying Partys desire to accept a firm offer
to settle a Third Party Claim without leading to liability or the creation of
a financial or other obligation on the part of the Indemnified Party, the
maximum liability of the Indemnifying Party as to such Third Party

 



73

    

 Claim shall not exceed the amount of such settlement offer. The Indemnified
Party may thereafter assume and continue the defense of such Third Party Claim
at the Indemnified Partys sole cost and expense, by prompt written notice to

SECTION 7.8 _Payment_.

 

7.8.1. All amounts for which indemnification is provided under _Article 7_
will be paid in cash in immediately available funds upon (i) agreement of
Buyers and Seller Representative with respect to the amount thereof or (ii) a
final, binding and non-appealable judgment of a court of competent
jurisdiction concerning same; provided however, that with respect to any
indemnification payment which a Buyer Indemnified Party shall be entitled
under _Article_ _ 7_, such payment shall first be recovered from the
Indemnification Escrow Account and, after exhaustion thereof, then from, as
selected by Seller Representative, either or a combination of (A) the delivery
of shares of Buyer Parent Common Stock with a per share value equal to the
closing price per share for Buyer Parent Common Stock on the New York Stock
Exchange on the date of such delivery; _provided_ , that Sellers and Seller
Representative shall use commercially reasonable efforts to cooperate with the
delivery and surrender of such shares of Buyer Parent Common Stock to Buyer
Parent (including the execution and delivery of necessary certificates,
instructions, stock powers and documents) or (B) cash from other sources,
including, at the election of such Buyer Indemnified Party, by offset
from any Earnout Payment that would otherwise be due and payable in
accordance with this Agreement in an amount equal to any such indemnification
payment; _provided_ , that if the amount of any such Earnout Payment is not
sufficient to provide a full recovery for such indemnification payment, then
Sellers shall pay the amount of such indemnification payment that remains
outstanding after such Buyer Indemnified Party exercises such offset right
with respect to such indemnification payment.

 

7.8.2. One (1) month after the Survival Period Expiration Date, the Escrow
Agent shall release any remaining funds in the Indemnification Escrow Account
pursuant to a joint instruction delivered pursuant to the terms of the
Indemnification Escrow Agreement (to the extent not utilized to pay Buyer
Indemnified Parties for any indemnification claim) to Seller Representative
(on behalf of Sellers) in accordance with the Indemnification Escrow
Agreement, except that the Escrow Agent shall retain an amount (up to the
total amount then held by the Escrow Agent) equal to the amount of claims
for indemnification under this _Article 7_ asserted prior to such date but
not yet resolved (the " _Unresolved Claims_ "). The Indemnification Escrow
Amount retained for Unresolved Claims shall be released by the Escrow Agent

favor of Buyers) upon their resolution in accordance with this _Article 7_ and
the Indemnification Escrow Agreement.

 



74

    

7.8.3. Sellers and Buyers agree to treat any indemnity payment
made, including from the Indemnification Escrow Amount, pursuant to this

the maximum extent permitted by applicable Law.

shall be no recovery for any Losses by the Buyer Indemnified Parties under

the determination of the final Net Adjustment Amount pursuant to _Section
1.2_.

in this Agreement are contractual in nature only and subject to the sole and
exclusive remedies set forth herein. No Person is asserting the truth of any

warranties contained in this Agreement or any other Transaction Document that

continue to be effective until the expiration of the Shelf
Effectiveness Period.

SECTION 2.2 _Effective Registration and Expenses_. A registration will not
count as the Demand Request until the Shelf Registration Statement has become

case the Company will be deemed to have fulfilled its obligations set forth in
_Section_ __ _ 2.1_ unless (a) the Holders pay all Registration Expenses in
connection with such withdrawn registration, (b) during the registration
process material adverse information regarding the Company is disclosed that
was not known by the Holders at the time the Demand Request was made, or (c)

Statement is not effective or otherwise not available for the offer or sale
of Registrable Securities for at least 18 months between February 1, 2019 and

additional Underwritten Shelf Takedown Demand and (b) if the total number of
Registrable Securities to be sold or otherwise distributed in any such
Underwritten Offering by the Participating Holders is cutback (pursuant to
_Section_ __ _ 2.5_) to less than 50% of the Registrable Securities
requested for distribution by the Participating Holders, then such
Underwritten Offering shall not be counted for purposes of the Majority
Holders right to two Underwritten Shelf Takedown Demands.

Underwriter(s) advise the Requesting Holders that in their opinion the
inclusion of all securities requested to be included in the Underwritten Shelf
Takedown (whether by the Company, any other Person, the Requesting Holders or
the other Holders) may materially and adversely affect the price or success of
the offering (a " _Material Adverse Effect_ "), then all such securities to
be included in such Underwritten Shelf Takedown shall be limited to the

Requesting Holders, the other Holders who properly requested to include their
securities in such Underwritten Shelf Takedown pursuant to this Agreement and

ARTICLE 3

 

PIGGYBACK RIGHTS

SECTION 3.1 _Piggyback Offerings_.

3.1.1. If the Shelf Registration Statement has not yet been filed and declared
effective or if the Shelf Registration Statement is not then effective, if
the Company proposes to file a registration statement under the Securities Act
to permit the sale or resale of any shares of Common Stock for its own account
or for the account of any holder of Common Stock in an Underwritten Offering
(other than a registration statement on Form S-4 or Form S-8 or any substitute
form that may be adopted by the SEC or any registration statement filed in
connection with an exchange offer or offering of securities solely to the
Companys existing security holders or under an employee benefit plan and only
on a form that would permit the registration of Registrable Securities) (a "
_Piggyback Registration Statement_ "), then the Company shall as soon as
practicable give written notice of such proposed filing to the Holders (but in
no event less than five Business Days before the anticipated filing date of
such registration statement), and such notice shall offer each Holder the
opportunity to register and sell in such Underwritten Offering such number of

 



6

    

 Registrable Securities as each such Holder may request; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that the Company shall not be required to provide such notice or
make such offer to the Holders if the Company has been advised by the
managing Underwriter(s) that the inclusion of any Registrable Securities may
have a Material Adverse Effect. Each Holder agrees that the fact that such a
notice has been delivered shall constitute confidential information, and each
Holder agrees not to disclose that such notice has been delivered or effect
any public sale or distribution of Common Stock until the earlier of (a) the
date and time on which the registration statement prepared in connection with
such notice has been filed with the SEC and (b) 20 days after the date of such
notice. Subject to _Section_ __ _ 3.2_, the Company shall include in each
such Piggyback Registration Statement and related Underwritten Offering all
Registrable Securities requested by the Holders to be included therein by
written notice to the Company within 10 days after the Companys notice
referred to above was given (in accordance with  _Section_ __ _ 10.3_)
(except that (i) if the managing Underwriter(s) determine that marketing
factors require a shorter time period and the Holders are so informed in the
applicable written notice, the Holders written request for inclusion must be
made within five days and (ii) in the case of an "overnight" offering or a
"bought deal," the Holders written request for inclusion must be made within
one Business Day); _provided_ ,  _however_ , that the Company may at any time
withdraw or cease proceeding with any such registration prior to effectiveness
of such registration whether or not any Holder has elected to include any
Registrable Securities in such registration. Each Holder shall be permitted
to withdraw all or part of such Holders Registrable Securities from a
Piggyback Registration Statement at any time prior to the effective date
thereof.

 

3.1.2. On and after the date on which the Shelf Registration Statement has
been declared effective, if the Company or any holder of Common Stock
proposes to sell any shares of Common Stock in an Underwritten Offering and
the Shelf Registration Statement is then effective, then the Company shall
promptly give written notice of such proposed offering to the Holders,
and such notice shall offer each Holder the opportunity to sell its
Registrable Securities in such offering as each such Holder may request (a "
_Piggyback Offering_ "). Each Holder agrees that the fact that such a notice
has been delivered shall constitute confidential information, and such Holder
agrees not to disclose that such notice has been delivered or effect any
public sale or distribution of Common Stock until the earlier of (a) the date
and time on which the registration statement or prospectus supplement
prepared in connection with such notice has been filed with the SEC and (b) 20
days after the date of such notice. Subject to _Section_ __ _ 3.2_, the
Company shall include in each such Piggyback Offering all Registrable
Securities requested to be included therein by written notice to the Company
within 10 days after the Companys notice referred to above was given (in
accordance with _Section_ __ _ 10.3_) (except that (i) if the managing
Underwriter(s) determine that marketing factors require a shorter time period
and the Holders are so informed in the applicable written notice, the Holders
written request for inclusion must be made within five days and (ii) in the
case of an "overnight" offering or a "bought deal," the Holders written
request for inclusion must be made within one Business Day); _provided_ ,
_however_ , that the Company may at any time withdraw or cease proceeding
with any such offering prior to the launch of such offering whether or not any
Holder has elected to include any Registrable Securities in such offering.
Each Holder shall be permitted to withdraw all or part of such Holders
Registrable Securities from a Piggyback Offering at any time prior to the
launch of such offering.

 



7

    

SECTION 3.2 _Selection of Underwriters_. The Company shall select the
investment banking firm(s) to act as the managing Underwriter(s) in
connection with an Underwritten Offering pursuant to a Piggyback Registration
Statement or a Piggyback Offering if it is initiated as a primary Underwritten
Offering on behalf of the Company. The Company shall use commercially
reasonable efforts to cause the managing Underwriter(s) of a proposed
Underwritten Offering to permit the Registrable Securities requested to be
included in the offering to be included on the same terms and conditions as
any similar securities included therein. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the
Company shall not be required to include any Holders Registrable Securities
in such offering unless such Holder complies with the provisions of 
_Section_ __ _ 8.1_.

SECTION 3.3 _Priority in Underwritten Piggyback Offerings_. If the managing
Underwriter(s) of a proposed an Underwritten Offering pursuant to a Piggyback
Registration Statement or a Piggyback Offering advise the Company that in
their opinion the inclusion of all securities requested to be included in such
offering (whether by the Company, any other Person or the Holders) may cause
a Material Adverse Effect, then all such securities to be included in such
offering shall be limited to the securities that the managing Underwriter(s)
believe can be sold without a Material Adverse Effect and shall be allocated
as follows:

(a) if such offering was initiated by the Company to sell or otherwise
distribute securities for its own account, then (i) first to the Company,
(ii) second, to the extent that any additional securities can, in the opinion
of such managing Underwriter(s), be sold without a Material Adverse Effect,
pro rata among the Holders who properly requested to include their securities
in such offering pursuant to this Agreement and the SCF Holders and Affiliates
of the Company who properly requested to include their securities in such
offering pursuant to the Stockholders Agreement (based on the number of
shares of Common Stock held at such time by such Persons that are "Registrable
Securities" under this Agreement or the Stockholders Agreement), and (iii)
third, to the extent that any additional securities can, in the opinion of
such managing Underwriter(s), be sold without a Material Adverse Effect, to
the Companys stockholders who properly requested to include their securities
in such offering pursuant to an agreement, other than this Agreement or the
Stockholders Agreement, with the Company that provides for registration rights
in accordance with the terms of such registration rights agreement;

 

(b) if such offering was initiated by an SCF Holder pursuant to the
Stockholders Agreement, then (i) first, pro rata among the SCF Holders who
initiated such offering and the other SCF Holders and Affiliates of the
Company who properly requested to include their securities in such offering
pursuant to the Stockholders Agreement and the Holders who properly requested
to include their securities in such offering pursuant to this Agreement
(based on the number of shares of Common Stock held at such time by such
Persons that are "Registrable Securities" under this Agreement or the
Stockholders Agreement), (ii) second, to the extent that any additional
securities can, in the opinion of such managing Underwriter(s), be sold

to an agreement, other than this Agreement or the Stockholders Agreement, with
the Company that provides for registration rights in accordance with the terms
of such registration rights agreement, and (iii) third, to the extent that
any additional securities can, in the opinion of such managing Underwriter(s),
be sold without a Material Adverse Effect, to the Company; and

 



8

Agreement, with the Company that provides for registration rights, then (i)
first, among the Companys stockholders who initiated such offering or

rights agreement, (ii) second, pro rata among the Holders who properly
requested to include their securities in such offering pursuant to this

DEFERRALS AND SUSPENSIONS

 

SECTION 4.1 _Deferral of Filing_. The Company may defer the filing (but not
the preparation) of the Shelf Registration Statement if (a) at the time the
Company receives the Demand Request, (i) the Company or any of its
subsidiaries are engaged in confidential negotiations or other confidential
business activities, disclosure of which would be required in
such registration statement (but would not be required if such registration
statement were not filed) and the Board determines in good faith that such
disclosure would be materially detrimental to the Company or (ii) the Company
has experienced some other material non-public event or is in possession of
material non-public information concerning the Company, and the Board
determines in good faith that such disclosure would be materially detrimental
to the Company, until a date not later than 60 days after the Required Filing
Date or (b) prior to receiving such Demand Request, the Board had determined
to effect an Underwritten Offering of the Companys equity securities for the
Companys account and the Company had taken substantial steps (including, but
not limited to, selecting or entering into a letter of intent with the
managing Underwriter(s) for such offering) and is proceeding with reasonable
diligence to effect such offering, until a date not later than the end of the
lock-up period referred to in the underwriting agreement relating to such
Underwritten Offering. A deferral of the filing of the Shelf Registration
Statement pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 4.1_ shall be lifted, and the Shelf
Registration Statement shall be filed as soon as reasonably practicable, if,
in the case of a deferral pursuant to clause (a) of the preceding sentence,
the negotiations or other activities are disclosed or terminated, or in the
case of a deferral pursuant to clause (b) of the preceding sentence, the
proposed Underwritten Offering for the Companys account is abandoned. In
order to defer the filing of the Shelf Registration Statement pursuant to this
_Section_ __ _ 4.1_, the Company shall promptly, upon determining to seek
such deferral, deliver to each Holder a certificate signed by the Chief
Executive Officer of the Company stating that the Company is deferring such
filing pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 4.1_ and the basis therefor in
reasonable detail. Within 20 days after receiving such certificate, the
Majority Holders may withdraw the Demand Request by giving written notice to
the Company, but following such withdrawal, the Holders shall be prohibited
from making a Demand Request until the end of the deferral period
as contemplated by

 



9

    

 this _Section_ __ _ 4.1_. If withdrawn, the Demand Request shall be deemed
not to have been made for all purposes of this Agreement. The Company may
defer the filing of the Shelf Registration Statement pursuant to this
_Section_ __ _ 4.1_ only two times during any 12-month period.

 

SECTION 4.2 _Use, and Suspension of Use, of Shelf Registration Statement_. The
Company shall be entitled to suspend for a reasonable period of time (but not
more than 60 consecutive days and not more than 120 days in any 12-month
period) the offer or sale of Registrable Securities pursuant to the Shelf
Registration Statement by any Holder if (a) a "road show" is not then in
progress with respect to a proposed offering of Registrable Securities by such
Holder pursuant to such registration statement and such Holder has not
executed an underwriting agreement with respect to a pending sale of
Registrable Securities pursuant to such registration statement and (b)(i) the
Company or any of its subsidiaries are engaged in confidential negotiations or
other confidential business activities, disclosure of which would be required
if such registration statement were used (but would not be required if such

the Company has experienced some other material non-public event or is in
possession of material non-public information concerning the Company, and the
Board determines in good faith that such disclosure would be materially
detrimental to the Company. In order to suspend the use of the Shelf

Securities to be registered thereunder in accordance with the intended method
of distribution thereof, and use commercially reasonable efforts and proceed
diligently and in good faith to cause such filed registration statement to

to the Company selected by the Majority Holders, copies of all such documents

such counsel; _provided further_ , the Company shall not file the Shelf
Registration Statement or any amendments or supplements thereto if the
Majority Holders or their counsel reasonably object on a timely basis; 

---|---|--- 
 



     | (b) |

prepare and file with the SEC such amendments and supplements to the Shelf
Registration Statement and the prospectus used in connection therewith as may
be necessary to keep the Shelf Registration Statement effective pursuant to
_Section_ __ _ 2_ for the Shelf Effectiveness Period and comply with the
provisions of the Securities  

---|---|--- 
 



10

         |  Act with respect to the disposition of all Registrable
Securities covered by the Shelf Registration Statement during such period in
accordance with the intended method of disposition set forth in the Shelf
Registration Statement; _provided, however,_ that a Holder that has been
included on the Shelf Registration Statement may request that such Holders
Registrable Securities be removed from the Shelf Registration Statement,
in which event the Company shall promptly either withdraw the Shelf
Registration Statement or file a post-effective amendment to the Shelf
Registration Statement removing such Registrable Securities; 
---|--- 
 



     | (c) |

furnish to each Holder such number of copies of the Shelf Registration
Statement, each amendment and supplement thereto (in each case including all
exhibits thereto), the prospectus included therein (including each preliminary
prospectus) and such other documents as such Holder may reasonably request in
order to facilitate the disposition of the Registrable Securities owned by
such Holder; 

---|---|--- 



     | (d) |

notify the Holders promptly, and (if requested by any such Holder) confirm
such notice in writing, (i) when a prospectus or any prospectus supplement or
post-effective amendment has been filed, and, with respect to the Shelf
Registration Statement or any post-effective amendment thereto, when the same
has become effective under the Securities Act and each applicable state law,
(ii) of any request by the SEC or any other federal or state governmental
authority for amendments or supplements to the Shelf Registration Statement or
related prospectus or for additional information, (iii) of the issuance by
the SEC of any stop order suspending the effectiveness of the Shelf
Registration Statement or the initiation of any proceedings for that purpose,
(iv) if at any time the representations or warranties of the Company or any
of its subsidiaries contained in any agreement (including any underwriting
agreement) contemplated by _Section_ __ _ 5.1(i)_ cease to be true and
correct in any material respect, (v) of the receipt by the Company of any
notification with respect to the suspension of the qualification or exemption
from qualification of any of the Registrable Securities for sale in any
jurisdiction or the initiation or threatening of any proceeding for such
purpose, (vi) of the happening of any event that makes any statement made in
the Shelf Registration Statement or related prospectus or any document
incorporated or deemed to be incorporated therein by reference untrue in any
material respect or that requires the making of any changes in such
registration statement, prospectus or documents so that, in the case of the
Shelf Registration Statement, it will not contain any untrue statement of a
material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated
therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, and that
in the case of the prospectus, it will not contain any untrue statement of a
material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be
stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein, in light of the
circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, and (vii) of the
Companys reasonable determination that a post-effective amendment to the
Shelf Registration Statement would be appropriate; 

---|---|--- 



     | (e) |

use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain the withdrawal of any order
suspending the effectiveness of the Shelf Registration Statement, or the
lifting of any suspension of the qualification (or exemption from
qualification) of any of the Registrable Securities for sale in any
jurisdiction, at the earliest practicable moment; 

---|---|--- 
 



11

         | (f) |

in connection with any Underwritten Offering, cooperate with the Holders and
the managing Underwriter(s) to facilitate the timely preparation and delivery
of certificates representing Registrable Securities to be sold, which
certificates shall not bear any restrictive legends and shall be in a form
eligible for deposit with The Depositary Trust Company;  

---|---|--- 



     | (g) |

in connection with any Underwritten Offering, use commercially reasonable
efforts to register or qualify such Registrable Securities as promptly as
practicable under such other securities or blue sky laws of such jurisdictions
as any Holder or managing Underwriter(s) reasonably (in light of the intended
plan of distribution) requests and do any and all other acts and things that
may be reasonably necessary or advisable to enable such Holder or managing
Underwriter(s) to consummate the disposition in such jurisdictions of the
Registrable Securities owned by such Holder; _provided_ that the Company will
not be required to (i) qualify generally to do business in any jurisdiction
where it would not otherwise be required to qualify but for this _Section_ __
_ 5.1(g)_, (ii) subject itself to taxation in any such jurisdiction, or
(iii) consent to general service of process in any such jurisdiction; 

---|---|--- 



     | (h) |

required of the Company to enable the Holders thereof to consummate the
disposition of such Registrable Securities;  

---|---|--- 



     | (i) |

in connection with any Underwritten Offering, enter into customary agreements
(including an underwriting agreement in customary form with customary
indemnification provisions) and take such other actions as are reasonably
required or advisable in order to expedite or facilitate the disposition of
such Registrable Securities, including providing reasonable availability of
appropriate members of senior management of the Company to provide customary
due diligence assistance in connection with any offering and to participate in
customary "road show" presentations in connection with any Underwritten
Offerings in substantially the same manner as they would in an Underwritten
Offering by the Company of its Common Stock for its own account, after taking
into account the reasonable business requirements of the Company
in determining the scheduling and duration of any road show; 

---|---|--- 



     | (j) |

in connection with any Underwritten Offering, make available for inspection by
any Holder, any Underwriter participating in any disposition pursuant to the
Shelf Registration Statement and any attorney, accountant or other
professional retained by any such Holder or Underwriter (collectively, the "
_Inspectors_ ") all financial and other records, pertinent corporate
documents and properties of the Company (collectively, the " _Records_ ") as
shall be reasonably necessary to enable them to exercise their due diligence
responsibility, and cause the Companys officers, 

---|---|--- 
 



12

         |  directors and employees to supply all information reasonably
requested by any such Inspectors in connection with the Shelf Registration
Statement. Each Holder agrees that information obtained by it as a result of
such inspections shall be deemed confidential and shall not be used by it as
the basis for any market transactions in the securities of the Company or its
Affiliates unless and until such is made generally available to the
public (other than by such Holder). Each Holder further agrees that it will,
as soon as practicable upon learning that disclosure of such Records is sought
in a court of competent jurisdiction, give notice to the Company and allow the
Company at its expense to undertake appropriate action to prevent disclosure
of the Records deemed confidential; 
---|--- 



     | (k) |

in connection with any Underwritten Offering, use commercially reasonable
efforts to obtain a comfort letter or comfort letters from the Companys
independent public accountants in customary form and covering such matters of
the type customarily covered by comfort letters as the managing Underwriter(s)
reasonably request; 

---|---|--- 
 



     | (l) |

otherwise use commercially reasonable efforts to comply with all applicable
rules and regulations of the SEC, and make available to its security holders,
as soon as reasonably practicable, an earnings statement covering a period of
12 months, beginning within three months after the effective date of the Shelf
Registration Statement, which earnings statement shall satisfy the provisions
of Section 11(a) of the Securities Act; 

---|---|--- 



     | (m) |

use commercially reasonable efforts to cause all Registrable Securities to be
listed on each securities exchange on which similar securities issued by the
Company are then listed or quoted on any inter-dealer quotation system on
which similar securities issued by the Company are then quoted; 

---|---|--- 
 



     | (n) |

if any event contemplated by _Section_ __ _ 5.1(c)(vi)_ shall occur, as
promptly as practicable prepare a supplement or amendment or post-effective
amendment to the Shelf Registration Statement or the related prospectus or any
document incorporated therein by reference or promptly file any other required
document so that, as thereafter delivered to the purchasers of the
Registrable Securities, the prospectus will not contain an untrue statement of
a material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated
therein or necessary to make the statements therein, in light of the
circumstances under which they were made, not misleading; 

---|---|--- 



     | (o) |

in connection with any Underwritten Offering, cooperate and assist in any
filing required to be made with FINRA and in the performance of any due
diligence investigation by any Underwriter, including any "qualified
independent underwriter," or any Holder; and 

---|---|--- 



      | (p) |

upon request and subject to appropriate confidentiality obligations, furnish
to a Holder copies of any and all transmittal letters or other correspondence
with the SEC or any other governmental authority having jurisdiction over the
Holders offering of Registrable Securities, in each case relating to an
offering by the Holder of Registrable Shares, unless confidential treatment
of such correspondence has been requested of the SEC; _provided_ that the
Company may excise any information contained therein that would constitute
material non-public information. 

---|---|--- 
 



13

    

Notwithstanding anything contained herein to the contrary, the Company hereby
agrees that the Shelf Registration Statement shall contain all language
(including on the prospectus cover page, the principal stockholders chart and
the plan of distribution) as may be reasonably requested by a Holder. The
Company may require, by written request, each Holder to promptly furnish in
writing to the Company such information regarding the distribution of the
Registrable Securities as it may from time to time reasonably request and such
other information as may be legally required in connection with such
registration. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, the Company
shall have the right to exclude from any offering the Registrable Securities
of any Holder who does not comply with the provisions of the
immediately preceding sentence.

Each Holder agrees that, upon receipt of any notice from the Company of the
happening of any event of the kind described in _Section_ __ _ 5.1(d)(vi)_,
such Holder will forthwith discontinue disposition of Registrable Securities
pursuant to the Shelf Registration Statement until such Holders receipt of
the copies of the supplemented or amended prospectus contemplated by
_Section_ __ _ 5.1(n)_, and, if so directed by the Company, such Holder will
deliver to the Company all copies, other than permanent file copies, then in
such Holders possession, of the most recent prospectus covering such
Registrable Securities at the time of receipt of such notice.

ARTICLE 7

 

INDEMNIFICATION; CONTRIBUTION

 

SECTION 7.1 _Indemnification by the Company_. The Company agrees to indemnify
and hold harmless each Holder, each Person, if any, who Controls such Holder
within the meaning of Section 15 of the Securities Act or Section 20 of the
Exchange Act, and the officers, directors, agents, general and limited
partners, and employees of each Holder and each such Controlling Person from
and against any and all losses, claims, damages, liabilities (joint or
several) and expenses (including reasonable costs of investigation and
attorneys fees) arising out of or based upon any untrue statement or alleged
untrue statement of a material fact contained in any registration statement
or prospectus relating to the Registrable Securities or in any amendment or
supplement thereto or in any preliminary prospectus, or arising out of or
based upon any omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact
required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not
misleading, except insofar as such losses, claims, damages, liabilities or
expenses arise out of, or are based upon and in conformity with, any such
untrue statement or omission or allegation thereof based upon information
furnished in writing to the Company by such Holder or on such Holders behalf
expressly for use therein. The Company also agrees to indemnify
any Underwriters of the Registrable Securities, their officers and directors
and each Person who Controls such Underwriters on substantially the same basis
as that of the indemnification of the Holders provided in this  _Section_ __
_ 7.1_.

SECTION 7.2 _Indemnification by Holder_. Each Holder agrees to indemnify and
hold harmless each other Holder, the Company, each Person, if any, who
Controls the Company within the meaning of either Section 15 of the Securities
Act or Section 20 of the Exchange Act and the

 



15

    

 officers, directors, agents and employees of each other Holder, the Company
and each such Controlling Person to the same extent as the foregoing indemnity
from the Company to such Holder, but only with respect to information
furnished in writing by such Holder or on such Holders behalf expressly for
use in any registration statement or prospectus relating to the Registrable
Securities. The liability of any Holder under this  _Section_ __ _ 7.2_
shall be limited to the aggregate cash and property received by such Holder
pursuant to the sale of Registrable Securities covered by such registration
statement or prospectus.

 

SECTION 7.3 _Conduct of Indemnification Proceedings_. If any action or
proceeding (including any governmental investigation) shall be brought or
asserted against any Person entitled to indemnification under _Section_ __ _
7.1_ or _7.2_ (an " _Indemnified Party_ ") in respect of which indemnity may
be sought from any Person who has agreed to provide such indemnification
under _Section_ __ _ 7.1_ or _7.2_ (an " _Indemnifying Party_ "), the
Indemnified Party shall give prompt written notice to the Indemnifying Party
and the Indemnifying Party shall assume the defense thereof, including the
employment of counsel reasonably satisfactory to such Indemnified Party, and
shall assume the payment of all reasonable expenses of such defense. Such
Indemnified Party shall have the right to employ separate counsel in any such
action or proceeding and to participate in the defense thereof, but the fees
and expenses of such counsel shall be at the expense of such Indemnified Party
unless (a) the Indemnifying Party has agreed to pay such fees and expenses,
(b) the Indemnifying Party fails promptly to assume the defense of such action
or proceeding or fails to employ counsel reasonably satisfactory to such
Indemnified Party, or (c) the named parties to any such action or proceeding
(including any impleaded parties) include both such Indemnified Party and
Indemnifying Party (or an Affiliate of the Indemnifying Party), and such
Indemnified Party shall have been advised by counsel that there may be one or
more legal defenses available to the Indemnified Party that are different
from or additional to those available to the Indemnifying Party, or there is a
conflict of interest on the part of counsel employed by the Indemnifying Party
to represent such Indemnified Party (in which case, if such Indemnified Party
notifies the Indemnifying Party in writing that it elects to employ separate
counsel at the expense of the Indemnifying Party, the Indemnifying Party shall
not have the right to assume the defense of such action or proceeding on
behalf of such Indemnified Party). Notwithstanding the foregoing, the
Indemnifying Party shall not, in connection with any such action or proceeding
or separate but substantially similar related actions or proceedings in the
same jurisdiction arising out of the same general allegations or
circumstances, be liable at any time for the fees and expenses of more than
one separate firm of attorneys (together in each case with appropriate local
counsel). The Indemnifying Party shall not be liable for any settlement of
any such action or proceeding effected without its written consent (which
consent will not be unreasonably withheld), but if settled with its written
consent, or if there be a final judgment for the plaintiff in any such action
or proceeding, the Indemnifying Party shall indemnify and hold harmless such
Indemnified Party from and against any loss or liability (to the extent stated
above) by reason of such settlement or judgment. The Indemnifying Party shall
not consent to entry of any judgment or enter into any settlement that does
not include as an unconditional term thereof the giving by the claimant or
plaintiff to such Indemnified Party of a release, in form and substance
reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnified Party, from all liability in
respect of such action or proceeding for which such Indemnified Party would be
entitled to indemnification hereunder.

 



16

    

SECTION 7.4 _Contribution_. If the indemnification provided for in  _Section_
__ _ 7.1_ or _7.2_ is unavailable to the Indemnified Parties in respect of
any losses, claims, damages, liabilities or judgments referred to herein, then
each such Indemnifying Party, in lieu of indemnifying such Indemnified
Parties, shall contribute to the amount paid or payable by such Indemnified
Parties as a result of such losses, claims, damages, liabilities and judgments
as between the Company on the one hand and each Holder on the other, in
such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative fault of the
Company and of each Holder in connection with the statements or omissions that
resulted in such losses, claims, damages, liabilities or judgments, as well as
any other relevant equitable considerations. The relative fault of the
Company on the one hand and of each Holder on the other shall be determined by
reference to, among other things, whether the untrue or alleged untrue
statement of a material fact or the omission or alleged omission to state a
material fact relates to information supplied by such Person, and such
Persons relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to
correct or prevent such statement or omission.

 

The Company and the Holders agree that it would not be just and equitable if
contribution pursuant to this  _Section_ __ _ 7.4_ were determined by any
method of allocation that does not take into account the equitable
considerations referred to in the immediately preceding paragraph. The amount
paid or payable by an Indemnified Party as a result of the losses, claims,
damages, liabilities or judgments referred to in the immediately preceding
paragraph shall be deemed to include, subject to the limitations set forth
above, any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by such Indemnified
Party in connection with investigating or defending any such action or claim.
Notwithstanding the provisions of this _Section_ __ _ 7.4_, no Holder shall
be required to contribute any amount in excess of the amount by which the
total price at which the Registrable Securities of such Holder were offered to
the public (less any underwriting discounts or commissions) exceeds the amount
of any damages that such Holder has otherwise been required to pay by reason
of such untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission.
No Person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of
Section 11(f) of the Securities Act) shall be entitled to contribution from
any Person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation.

ARTICLE 8

 

PARTICIPATION IN UNDERWRITTEN OFFERINGS

 

SECTION 8.1 _Participation in Underwritten Offerings_. No Holder may
participate in any Underwritten Offerings hereunder unless such Holder (a)
agrees to sell such Holders Registrable Securities on the basis provided in
any underwriting arrangements approved by the Person entitled hereunder to
approve such arrangements and (b) completes and executes all questionnaires,
powers of attorney, custody agreements, indemnities, underwriting agreements
and other documents reasonably required under the terms of such underwriting
arrangements and this Agreement; _provided_ that any obligation of
such Holder to indemnify any Person pursuant to any such underwriting
agreements shall be several, not joint and several, among such Holders selling
Registrable Shares, and such liability shall be limited to the proceeds (after
deducting underwriting commissions and discounts but before deducting any
other expenses) received by such Holder from the sale of his, her or its
Registrable Shares pursuant to such Underwritten Offering.

 

ARTICLE 9

TRANSFERS OF REGISTRATION RIGHTS

SECTION 9.1 _Transfers of Registration Rights_. The provisions hereof will
inure to the benefit of, and be binding upon, the successors and assigns of
each of the Parties, except as

 



17

    

 otherwise provided herein; _provided, however_ , that the registration
rights granted hereby may be transferred only (a) by operation of law or (b)
with the express prior written consent of the Company, _provided_ that any
such transferee shall not be entitled to the rights provided in this Agreement
unless such transferee of registration rights hereunder agrees to be bound by
the terms and conditions hereof and executes and delivers to the Company an
acknowledgment and agreement to such effect. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary contained in this _Section_ __ _ 9.1_, any Holder may elect to
transfer all or a portion of its Registrable Securities to any third party
without assigning its rights hereunder with respect thereto; _provided_ , that
in any such event all rights under this Agreement with respect to the
Registrable Securities so transferred shall cease and terminate. References
to a Party in this Agreement shall be deemed to include any such transferee or
assignee permitted by this _Section_ __ _ 9.1_.
