shares of Acquiror Stock or Company Stock will be appropriately adjusted to
provide to the Company Stockholders and the Acquiror Stockholders the same
economic effect as contemplated by this Agreement prior to such event;
_provided_ , _however_ , that this _Section 1.04_ shall not be construed to

connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, such amounts
that any such Person is required to deduct and withhold with respect to any of
the deliveries and payments contemplated by this Agreement under the Code or
any applicable provision of state, local or foreign Tax Law; _provided_
, however, that (a) at least five (5) Business Days before making any such
deduction or withholding, such withholding party gives notice to the

withholding (which notice shall include the basis of the proposed deduction
or withholding), and (b) such withholding party shall use its commercially
reasonable efforts to cooperate with the recipient of such payment to obtain
reduction of or relief from such deduction or withholding to the
extent permitted by applicable Law. To the extent that Acquiror, Merger Sub,
the Company, the Sponsor or any of their respective Affiliates withholds such
amounts with respect to any Person and properly remits such withheld amounts
to the applicable Governmental Authority, such withheld amounts shall be
treated as having been paid to or on behalf of such Person.

converted into an option or warrant, as applicable, to purchase a number of
shares of Acquiror Common Stock (each such option, an " _Exchanged Option_ "
and each such warrant, an " _Exchanged Warrant_ ") equal to the product
(rounded down to the nearest whole number) of (x) the number of shares of
Company Common Stock subject to such Company Option or Company Warrant
immediately prior to the Effective Time _multiplied_ by (y) the Exchange
Ratio, at an exercise price per share (rounded up to the nearest whole cent)
equal to (A) the exercise price per share of such Company Option or
Company Warrant immediately prior to the Effective Time _divided_ by (B) the
Exchange Ratio; _provided_ , _that_ , that the exercise price and the number
of shares of Acquiror Common Stock purchasable pursuant to the Exchanged
Options shall be determined in a manner consistent with the requirements of
Section 409A of the Code; _provided_ , _further_ , that in the case of any
Exchanged Option to which Section 422 of the Code applies, the exercise price
and the number of shares of the Surviving Company stock purchasable pursuant
to such option shall be determined in accordance with the foregoing, subject
to such adjustments as are necessary in order to satisfy the requirements of
Section 424(a) of the Code. Except as specifically provided above,
following the Effective Time, each Exchanged Option and Exchanged Warrant
shall continue to be governed by the same terms and conditions (including
vesting and exercisability terms) as were applicable to the corresponding
former Company Option or Company Warrant, as applicable, immediately prior to
the Effective Time. At or prior to the Effective Time, the parties and their
boards, as applicable, shall adopt any resolutions and take any actions that
are necessary to effectuate the treatment of the Company Options and
Company Warrants pursuant to this _Section 3.06_. Between the date of this
Agreement and the Closing Date, the Company will use commercially reasonable
efforts to obtain written confirmation from each holder of Company Warrants
that such holder will acknowledge and accept the treatment of the Company

expire upon the Effective Time in accordance with the terms of the
Company Warrants.

Allocation Schedule reflecting the portion of such Merger Consideration
allocable to each Person listed thereon. The Closing Date Company Certificate
shall be prepared in accordance with GAAP and using the accounting methods,
practices and procedures used to prepare the Financial Statements.

  



  

(b)  Acquiror and its Representatives shall have a reasonable
opportunity to review and to discuss with the Company and its Representatives
the Closing Date Company Certificate, and the Company and its Representatives
shall reasonably assist Acquiror and its Representatives in their review of
the Closing Date Company Certificate. The Company shall consider in good faith
any comments or objections to any amounts set forth on the Closing Date
Company Certificate notified to it by Acquiror prior to the Closing and if,
prior to the Closing, the Company and Acquiror agree to make any modification
to the Closing Date Company Certificate, then the Closing Date Company
Certificate as so modified shall be deemed to be the Closing Date Company
Certificate for purposes of calculating the Merger Consideration.

  



  

3.09   _Appraisal Rights_.

  



  

(a)  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this
Agreement, shares of Company Stock that are issued and
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time and held by a holder who
has not voted in favor of adoption of this Agreement or consented thereto in
writing and is entitled to demand and properly demands an appraisal of such
shares in accordance with, and who complies in all respects with, Section 262
of the DGCL or Chapter 13 of the CGCL by reason of Section 2115 of the CGCL
(any such shares being referred to as " _Dissenting Shares_ "), shall not be
converted into or represent the right to receive Per Share Merger
Consideration in accordance with _Section 3.01_ , and the holders thereof
shall be entitled only to such rights as are granted by Section 262 of the
DGCL or Chapter 13 of the CGCL to a holder of Dissenting Shares, as
applicable. At the Effective Time, the Dissenting Shares shall no longer be
outstanding and shall automatically be canceled and shall cease to exist.

  



  

   

22

 



    



  

(b)  If any Dissenting Shares shall lose their status as such
(through failure to perfect, waiver by the holder, withdrawal or otherwise,
or if a court of competent jurisdiction determines that the holder is not
entitled to the relief provided by Section 262 of the DGCL or Chapter 13 of
the CGCL), then, as of the later of the Effective Time or the date of loss of
such status, such shares shall be treated as if they had automatically been
converted into, and have become exchangeable for, the right to receive the
Per Share Merger Consideration in accordance with _Section 3.01_ , without
interest thereon, upon surrender of each Certificate representing such
shares.

  



  

(c)  The Company shall give Acquiror prompt notice of (i) any
written demand for appraisal pursuant to the DGCL or the CGCL received by the
Company prior to the Effective Time, or any other demand, notice or instrument
delivered to the Company prior to the Effective Time pursuant to the CGCL
that relates to such demand, and (ii) any withdrawal of any such demand.
Acquiror shall have a reasonable opportunity to participate in negotiations
and Actions with respect to any such demand for appraisal. The Company shall

have, individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect.

  



  

4.02   _Subsidiaries_.

  



  

(a)  The Subsidiaries of the Company as of the date hereof are

necessary to adopt this Agreement and approve the Transactions.

  



  

4.04   _No Conflict_. Subject to the receipt of the consents,
approvals, authorizations and other requirements set forth in _Section 4.05_
or on _Schedule 4.05_ , the execution, delivery and performance of this

interests or assets of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, except (in the
case of _clauses (b)_ , _(c)_ or _(d)_ above) for such violations, conflicts,
breaches or defaults which would not, individually or in the aggregate, (i) be
material to the Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, or (ii)
materially adversely affect the ability of the Company to perform or comply
with on a timely basis any material obligation under this Agreement or to

5.06   _Financial Ability; Trust Account_.

  



  

(a)  As of June 30, 2020, there was at least $234,150,964.57
invested in a trust account at Deutsche Bank Trust Company Americas (the "
_Trust Account_ "), maintained by American Stock Transfer and Trust Company,
LLC, a New York limited liability trust company, acting as trustee (the "
_Trustee_ "), pursuant to the Investment Management Trust Agreement, dated
February 7, 2019, by and between Acquiror and the Trustee (the " _Trust
Agreement_ "). Prior to the Closing, none of the funds held in the Trust
Account may be released except in accordance with the Trust Agreement, the
Acquiror Organizational Documents and Acquiror's final prospectus dated
February 11, 2019. Amounts in the Trust Account are invested in United
States Government securities or in money market funds meeting certain
conditions under Rule 2a-7 promulgated under the Investment Company Act of
1940, as amended. Acquiror has performed all material obligations required to
be performed by it to date under, and is not in material default or breach
under or materially delinquent in performance or any other respect (claimed or
actual) in connection with, the Trust Agreement, and no event has occurred
that, with or without notice or lapse of time or both, would constitute such
a default or breach thereunder. As of the date hereof, there are no claims or
proceedings pending with respect to the Trust Account. Since February 7, 2019
through the date hereof, Acquiror has not released any money from the Trust
Account (other than interest income earned on the principal held in the Trust
Account as permitted by the Trust Agreement). As of the Effective Time, the
obligations of Acquiror to dissolve or liquidate pursuant to the Acquiror
Organizational Documents shall terminate, and as of the Effective Time,
Acquiror shall have no obligation whatsoever pursuant to the Acquiror
Organizational Documents to dissolve and liquidate the assets of Acquiror by
reason of the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby. To
Acquiror's knowledge, as of the date hereof, following the Effective Time, no
Acquiror Stockholder shall be entitled to receive any amount from the Trust
Account except to the extent such Acquiror Stockholder is a Redeeming
Stockholder. There are no separate Contracts, side letters or other
arrangements or understandings (whether written or unwritten, express or
implied) that would cause the description of the Trust Agreement in the SEC
Reports to be inaccurate or that would entitle any Person (other than a
shareholder of Acquiror holding Acquiror Pre-Transaction Common Stock
originally sold in Acquiror's initial public offering who shall have
elected to redeem their shares of Acquiror Pre-Transaction Common Stock
pursuant to the Acquiror Organizational Documents and the underwriters of
Acquiror's initial public offering with respect to deferred underwriting
commissions) to any portion of the proceeds in the Trust Account.

  



  

   

46

 



    



  

(b)  As of the date hereof, assuming the accuracy of the
representations and warranties of the Company contained herein and the
compliance by the Company with its obligations hereunder, neither Acquiror nor
Merger Sub has any reason to believe that any of the conditions to the use of
funds in the Trust Account will not be satisfied or funds available in the
Trust Account will not be available to Acquiror and Merger Sub on the Closing
Date.

  



  

(c)  As of the date hereof, neither Acquiror nor Merger Sub
has, or has any present intention, agreement, arrangement or understanding to
enter into or incur, any obligations with respect to or under any
Indebtedness.

(a)  Acquiror has filed in a timely manner all required

other documents required to be filed by it with the SEC since February 7,
2019 (collectively, as they have been amended since the time of their filing
and including all exhibits thereto, the " _SEC Reports_ "). None of the SEC
Reports, as of their respective dates (or, if amended or superseded by a
filing prior to the date of this Agreement or the Closing Date, then on
the date of such filing), contained any untrue statement of a material fact
or omitted to state a material fact required to be stated therein or
necessary in order to make the statements made therein, in light of the
circumstances under which they were made, not misleading. The audited

each case, the notes and schedules thereto) included in the SEC Reports
complied as to form in all material respects with the published rules and
regulations of the SEC with respect thereto, were prepared in accordance with
GAAP applied on a consistent basis during the periods involved (except as may
be indicated therein or in the notes thereto and except with respect to
unaudited statements as permitted by Form 10-Q of the SEC) and fairly present

disclosure controls and procedures are designed to ensure that material
information relating to Acquiror is made known to Acquiror's principal
executive officer and its principal financial officer, particularly during the
periods in which the periodic reports required under the Exchange Act are
being prepared. To the knowledge of Acquiror, such disclosure controls and

for external purposes in accordance with GAAP.

  



  

(d)  There are no outstanding loans or other extensions of
credit made by Acquiror to any executive officer (as defined in Rule 3b-7
under the Exchange Act) or director of Acquiror. Acquiror has not taken any
action prohibited by Section 402 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act.

  



  

(e)  Neither Acquiror (including any employee thereof) nor
Acquiror's independent auditors has identified or been made aware of (i) any
significant deficiency or material weakness in the system of internal
accounting controls utilized by Acquiror, (ii) any fraud, whether or not
material, that involves Acquiror's management or other employees who have a
role in the preparation of financial statements or the internal accounting
controls utilized by Acquiror or (iii) any claim or allegation regarding
any of the foregoing.

Sub or to which Acquiror or Merger Sub is a party that has or would

Acquiror or Merger Sub or the conduct of business by Acquiror or Merger Sub as
currently conducted or as contemplated to be conducted as of the
Closing, other than such effects, individually or in the aggregate, which

obligations (i) reflected or reserved for on Acquiror's consolidated balance
sheet for the year ended December 31, 2019 as reported on Form 10-K
or disclosed in the notes thereto (other than any such liabilities not
reflected, reserved or disclosed as are not and would not be, in the

Indebtedness.

give Acquiror prompt written notice of any action taken or not taken by the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries or of any development regarding the

Company, that would cause the Proxy Statement/Prospectus to contain an untrue
statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact necessary in
order to make the statements, in light of the circumstances under which they
were made, not misleading; _provided_ that if any such action shall be taken
or fail to be taken or such development shall otherwise occur, Acquiror and

liabilities incurred in connection with any Action, whether civil, criminal,
administrative or investigative, arising out of or pertaining to matters

not less favorable than the terms of such current insurance coverage, except
that in no event shall Acquiror be required to pay an annual premium for such
insurance in excess of three hundred percent (300%) of the aggregate
annual premium payable by the Company for such insurance policy for the year
ended December 31, 2019; _provided_ , _however_ , that (i) Acquiror or the

directors' and officers' liability insurance by obtaining a six (6)-year
"tail" policy containing terms not materially less favorable than the
terms of such current insurance coverage with respect to claims existing or
occurring at or prior to the Effective Time and (ii) if any claim is
asserted or made within such six (6)-year period, any insurance required to

and cash incentive compensation opportunities, in each case, that are no less
favorable than the base salary or base wage rate and cash incentive
compensation opportunities provided to such Covered Employee
immediately prior to the Effective Time and (ii) other compensation and
employee benefits (excluding equity compensation and long-term incentives)
that are, in the aggregate, no less favorable than those provided to such
Covered Employee immediately prior to the Effective Time. Without limiting
the immediately preceding sentence, Acquiror shall cause the Surviving Company
(or its Subsidiaries, as appropriate) to provide to each Covered Employee
whose employment is terminated during the Continuation Period with
severance benefits equal to the severance benefits for which such Covered
Employee was eligible immediately prior to the Closing under the applicable
written Company Benefit Plan, if any, that is listed in _Schedule 4.13(a)_ ,
determined (A) without taking into account any reduction after the Closing in
compensation paid to such Covered Employee and (B) taking into account
each Covered Employee's service with the Company and its Subsidiaries (and
any predecessor entities) and, after the Closing, Acquiror and its
Affiliates.

  



  

   

65

 



    



  

(b)   As of the Effective Time and thereafter, Acquiror shall,
and shall cause the Surviving Company to, (i) ensure that no eligibility
waiting periods, actively-at-work requirements or pre-existing condition

under the applicable health and welfare benefits plan of Acquiror or any of
its Affiliates (except to the extent applicable under Company Benefit Plans
immediately prior to the Effective Time), (ii) waive any and all evidence of
insurability requirements with respect to the Covered Employees to the extent
such evidence of insurability requirements were not applicable to the Covered
Employees under the Company Benefit Plans immediately prior to the Effective
Time, (iii) credit each Covered Employee with all deductible payments, out-
of-pocket or other co-payments paid by such employee under the
Company Benefit Plans prior to the Closing Date during the year in which the
Closing occurs for the purpose of determining the extent to which any such
employee has satisfied his or her deductible and whether he or she has reached
the out-of-pocket maximum under any health benefit plan of Acquiror or any of
its Affiliates and (iv) recognize all service of each Covered Employee
with the Company and its Subsidiaries for all purposes in any employee
benefit plan of Acquiror and its Affiliates in which such Covered Employee is
eligible to participate to the same extent that such service was taken into
account under the Company Benefit Plans prior to the Effective Time;
_provided_ that the foregoing service recognition shall not apply to the
extent it would result in duplication of benefits for the same period of
services.

  



  

(c)  Parent shall, or shall cause the Surviving Company to,
assume, honor and fulfill all of the Company Benefit Plans in accordance with
their terms as in effect immediately prior to the Closing Date, as such
Company Benefit Plans may be modified or terminated from time to time in
accordance with their terms or with the consent of the applicant
participant(s) therein.

remedies (with respect to the matters provided for in this _Section 7.11_ )
under or by reason of any provision of this Agreement, including any rights
to continued employment or service with Acquiror, the Surviving Company or any
of their Subsidiaries. Notwithstanding anything in this _Section 7.11_ to the
contrary, nothing contained herein, whether express or implied, shall be
treated as an amendment or other modification of any Company Benefit Plan
maintained by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, or any employee benefit
plan maintained by Acquiror or any of its Subsidiaries or, on or after the
Effective Time, the Surviving Company or any of its Subsidiaries, or shall
limit the right of Acquiror to amend, terminate or otherwise modify any

Surviving Company to adopt or continue any specific employee benefit plans or
to continue the employment of any specific person.

Common Stock pursuant to this Agreement and the other agreements contemplated
hereby by any person owning securities of the Company who is expected to
become a director or officer (as defined under Rule 16a-1(f) under the
Exchange Act) of the Surviving Company following the Closing shall be an
exempt transaction for purposes of Section 16(b) of the Exchange Act pursuant

8.02   _Preparation of Form S-4 and Proxy Statement/Prospectus;

which will be included therein as a prospectus and which will be used as a

Company shall furnish all information concerning it as may reasonably be
requested by the other party in connection with such actions and the
preparation of the Form S-4 and the Proxy Statement/Prospectus. Promptly
after the Form S-4 is declared effective under the Securities Act, Acquiror

(b)  Each of Acquiror and the Company shall cooperate and
mutually agree upon (such agreement not to be unreasonably withheld or
delayed) any response to comments of the SEC or its staff with respect to the
Form S-4 or Proxy Statement/Prospectus and any amendment to the Form S-4 or
Proxy Statement filed in response thereto. If either Acquiror or the Company
becomes aware that any information contained in the Form S-4 or Proxy
Statement/Prospectus shall have become false or misleading in any material
respect or that the Form S-4 or Proxy Statement/Prospectus is required to be
amended in order to comply with applicable Law, then (i) such party shall

pursuant to applicable Law and subject to the terms and conditions of this
Agreement and the Acquiror Organizational Documents. Each of the Company and

receives from the SEC or its staff with respect to the Form S-4 or Proxy
Statement/Prospectus promptly after the receipt of such comments and shall
give the other party a reasonable opportunity to review and comment on any
proposed written or oral responses to such comments prior to responding to
the SEC or its staff. Each of Acquiror and the Company shall use reasonable
best efforts to cause the Form S-4 and the Proxy Statement/Prospectus to
comply with the rules and regulations promulgated by the SEC, to have the
Form S-4 declared effective as promptly as practicable after it is filed with
the SEC and to keep the Form S-4 effective through the Closing in order to
permit the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby.

  



  

   

68

 



    



  

(c)  Acquiror shall file the Proxy Statement on Schedule 14A in

action related thereto, with respect to (i) the approval of the Acquiror AandR
Certificate of Incorporation (the " _Amendment Proposal_ "), (ii) the
adoption and approval of this Agreement and the Merger (the " _Transaction

(the " _Director Election Proposal_ "), (iv) the approval of the LTIP

in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby (together with the
Amendment Proposal, the Transaction Proposal, the Director Election Proposal,
the Equity Plan Proposal and the Issuance Proposal, collectively, the  "
_Proposals_ "). Without the prior written consent of the Company, the
Proposals shall be the only matters (other than procedural matters) that
Acquiror shall propose to be acted on by Acquiror Stockholders at the Acquiror
Meeting.

  



  

(d)   The Company shall solicit the Requisite Company Approval
via written consent as soon as practicable after the Form S-4 is declared
effective under the Securities Act. In connection therewith, the Company
shall use reasonable best efforts to, as promptly as practicable: (i)
establish the record date for determining the Company Stockholders entitled
to provide such written consent; (ii) cause the Proxy Statement/Prospectus to
be disseminated to the Company Stockholders in compliance with applicable Law,
including the DGCL; and (iii) solicit written consents from the Company
Stockholders to give the Requisite Company Approval. The Company will provide
Acquiror with copies of all stockholder consents it receives within one (1)
Business Day of receipt. If the Requisite Company Approval is obtained, then
promptly following the receipt of the required written consents, the Company
will prepare and deliver to its stockholders who have not consented the
notice required by Section 228(e) of the DGCL and deliver to the stockholders
entitled thereto the notice required by Section 262(d)(2) of the DGCL. Unless
this Agreement has been terminated in accordance with its terms, the
Company's obligation to solicit written consents from the Company Stockholders
to give the Requisite Company Approval in accordance with this _Section
8.02(d)_ shall not be limited or otherwise affected by any development,
including the making, commencement, disclosure, announcement or submission of
any Acquisition Proposal or Superior Proposal, or by any Change in Company
Board Recommendation.

  



  

(e)  Acquiror shall use reasonable best efforts to, as promptly
as practicable (and in any event, within seven (7) Business Days after the
SEC Clearance Date), (i) cause the Proxy Statement/Prospectus to be
disseminated to Acquiror Stockholders in compliance with applicable Law, (ii)
establish the record date for, duly call, give notice of, convene and hold
the Acquiror Meeting in accordance with the DGCL for a date no later than

from the holders of Acquiror Stock to vote in favor of each of the Proposals.
Acquiror shall, through the Acquiror Board, recommend to Acquiror
Stockholders that they approve the Proposals and shall include such
recommendation in the Proxy Statement/Prospectus. Notwithstanding the
foregoing provisions of this _Section 8.02(e)_ , if on a date for which the
Acquiror Meeting is scheduled, Acquiror has not received proxies representing
a sufficient number of shares of Acquiror Stock to obtain the Acquiror
Stockholder Approval, whether or not a quorum is present, Acquiror shall have
the right to make one or more successive postponements or adjournments of the
Acquiror Meeting, _provided_ that the Acquiror Meeting (x) is not postponed
or adjourned to a date that is more than forty-five (45) days after the date
for which the Acquiror Meeting was originally scheduled (excluding any
adjournments or postponements required by applicable Law) and (y) is held no
later than three (3) Business Days prior to the Termination Date.

discussions or negotiations with, or enter into any agreement with, or
encourage, or provide information to, any Person (other than Acquiror, Merger
Sub and/or any of their Affiliates) concerning any Acquisition Transaction.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, the Company
may (i) seek to clarify and understand the terms and conditions of any _bona
fide_ , unsolicited written Acquisition Proposal made by any person or group
after the date hereof that did not result from a material breach of this
Agreement to determine whether such Acquisition Proposal constitutes or would
reasonably be likely to lead to a Superior Proposal, if consummated, if the
Company Board (A) shall have determined in good faith, after consultation
with its outside legal counsel and financial advisor, that such Acquisition
Proposal constitutes or would reasonably be expected to constitute or lead to
a Superior Proposal and (B) shall have determined in good faith, after
consultation with its outside legal counsel, that the failure to do so would
be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under applicable Law and (ii)
inform any person or group making any _bona fide_ , unsolicited
written Acquisition Proposal of the provisions of this _Section 8.03_. The
Company shall, and shall cause its Affiliates and Representatives to,
immediately cease any and all existing discussions or negotiations with any
Person conducted prior to the date hereof with respect to, or which is
reasonably likely to give rise to or result in, an Acquisition Transaction.

  



  

(b)  In addition to the obligations set forth in _Section
8.03(a)_ , the Company shall as promptly as practicable (and in any event
within twenty-four (24) hours) notify Acquiror of the receipt of any
Acquisition Proposal. Such notice to Acquiror shall indicate the material
terms and conditions of such Acquisition Proposal, including copies of any
written Acquisition Proposal (provided, that such notice need not include the
identity (or other identifying information) of the person making the
Acquisition Proposal). The Company shall thereafter keep Acquiror reasonably
informed as promptly as practicable (and in any event within twenty-four (24)
hours) of any material developments affecting the terms and conditions of any
such Acquisition Proposal.

  



  

(c)  Except as set forth in _Section 8.03(d)_ , neither the
Company Board nor any committee thereof shall: (i) fail to include the
Company Board Recommendation in the Proxy Statement/Prospectus when
disseminated to the Company Stockholders (and at all times thereafter prior
to receipt of the Company Stockholder Approval); (ii) withhold, withdraw,
amend, qualify or modify or publicly propose to withhold, withdraw, amend,
qualify or modify, in each case in a manner adverse to Acquiror or
Merger Sub, the Company Board Recommendation; (iii) adopt, approve, recommend
or declare advisable any Acquisition Proposal (other than those relating to
the Merger); or (iv) resolve, agree or publicly propose to take any such
actions (each such foregoing action or failure to act in clauses (i) through
(iv) being referred to herein as a " _Change in Company Board Recommendation_
").

  



  

   

70

 



    



  

(d)  Notwithstanding any provision of _Section 8.03(c)_ , at any
time prior to the receipt of the Company Stockholder Approval, but not after,
the Company Board may: (i) make a Change in Company Board Recommendation in
connection with a Company Intervening Event if the Company Board determines
in good faith, after consultation with its outside legal counsel, that failure
to do so would be inconsistent with its fiduciary obligations under
applicable Law; provided that if the Company Intervening Event relates to the
receipt of a _bona fide_ , unsolicited written Acquisition Proposal that did
not result from a material breach of this Agreement, the Company Board also
determines in good faith, after consultation with its financial advisor and
outside legal counsel, that such Acquisition Proposal constitutes a Superior
Proposal; _provided_ , _further_ , that prior to making any such Change in
Company Board Recommendation, (A) the Company shall provide Acquiror with
written notice of its intention to take such action at least three (3)
Business Days in advance of taking such action, specifying the reasons for the
Company Board's intention (it being understood that any material development
with respect to a Company Intervening Event shall require a new notice), (B)
the Company shall and shall direct its Representatives to negotiate in good
faith with Acquiror during such three (3) Business Day period, to the extent
Acquiror wishes to negotiate, to enable Acquiror to propose revisions or
modifications to the terms of this Agreement such that it would permit the
Company Board not to make a Change in Company Board Recommendation pursuant
to this _Section 8.03(d)_ and (C) at the end of such three (3) Business Day
period, the Company Board shall consider in good faith any revisions or
modifications to the terms of this Agreement proposed in writing by Acquiror,
and determine in good faith, after consultation with its outside legal
counsel and taking into account such revisions or modifications, whether the
Company Board's failure to make a Change in Company Board Recommendation
would continue to be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under applicable
Law; provided that if the Change in Company Board Recommendation relates to
the receipt of a _bona fide_ , unsolicited written Acquisition Proposal that
did not result from a material breach of this Agreement, the Company Board
also determines in good faith, after consultation with its financial advisor
and outside legal counsel, that such Acquisition Proposal continues to
constitute a Superior Proposal after taking into account such revisions and
modifications to this Agreement by the Acquiror. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, the Company's obligation to solicit written consents from the
Company Stockholders to give the Requisite Company Approval in accordance with
_Section 8.02(d)_ shall not be limited or otherwise affected by any Change
in Company Board Recommendation.

  



  

8.04   _Acquiror Exclusivity_.

  



  

(a)  During the Interim Period, neither Acquiror nor Merger Sub
shall take, nor shall they permit any of their respective Affiliates or

enter into any agreement with, or encourage, respond, provide information to
or commence due diligence with respect to, any Person (other than the Company
and/or any of its Affiliates), concerning, relating to or which is
intended to give rise to or result in, any offer, inquiry, proposal or
indication of interest, whether written or oral, relating to any Business
Combination other than with the Company, the Company Stockholders and their
respective Affiliates and Representatives (a " _Business Combination
Proposal_ "). Each of Acquiror and Merger Sub shall, and each shall cause its
respective Affiliates and Representatives to, immediately cease any and all
existing discussions or negotiations with any Person conducted prior to the
date hereof with respect to a Business Combination Proposal.

  



  

   

71

 



    



  

(b)  Except as set forth in _Section 8.04(c)_ , neither the

Acquiror Board Recommendation in the Proxy Statement/Prospectus when
disseminated to the Acquiror Stockholders (and at all times thereafter prior
to receipt of the Acquiror Stockholder Approval); (ii) withhold, withdraw,
amend, qualify or modify or publicly propose to withhold, withdraw, amend,
qualify or modify, in each case in a manner adverse to the Company, the
Acquiror Board Recommendation; or (iii) resolve, agree or publicly propose to
take any such actions (each such foregoing action or failure to act in
clauses (i) through (iii) being referred to herein as a " _Change in Acquiror
Board Recommendation_ ").

  



  

(c)  Notwithstanding any provision of _Section 8.04(b)_ , at any
time prior to the receipt of the Acquiror Stockholder Approval, but not
after, the Acquiror Board may: (i) make a Change in Acquiror Board
Recommendation in connection with an Acquiror Intervening Event if the
Acquiror Board determines in good faith, after consultation with its outside
legal counsel, that failure to do so would be inconsistent with its fiduciary
obligations under applicable Law; _provided_ , _however_ , that prior to
making such Change in Acquiror Board Recommendation, (A) Acquiror shall
provide the Company with written notice of its intention to take such action
at least three (3) Business Days in advance of taking such action, specifying
the reasons for the Acquiror Board's intention (it being understood that any
material development with respect to an Acquiror Intervening Event
shall require a new notice), (B) Acquiror shall and shall direct its
Representatives to negotiate in good faith with the Company during such three
(3) Business Day period, to the extent the Company wishes to negotiate, to
enable the Company to propose revisions or modifications to the terms of this
Agreement such that it would permit the Acquiror Board not to make a Change in
Acquiror Board Recommendation pursuant to this _Section 8.03(b)_ and (C) at
the end of such three (3) Business Day period, the Acquiror Board shall
consider in good faith any revisions or modifications to the terms of this
Agreement proposed in writing by the Company, and determine in good faith,
after consultation with its outside legal counsel and taking into account such
revisions or modifications, whether the Acquiror Board's failure to make a
Change in Acquiror Board Recommendation would continue to be
inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under applicable Law.

(d)  Nothing contained in this _Section 8.04_ shall prohibit
Acquiror or the Acquiror Board or any committee thereof from: (i) taking and
disclosing to the stockholders of Acquiror a position contemplated by Rule
14e-2(a) promulgated under the Exchange Act or making a statement

the Exchange Act (or any similar communication to shareholders in connection
with the making or amendment of a tender offer or exchange offer); (ii)

11.14   _Enforcement_. The parties hereto agree that irreparable damage,
for which monetary damages, even if available, would not be an adequate
remedy, would occur in the event that the parties hereto do not perform their
obligations under the provisions of this Agreement (including failing to take
such actions as are required of them hereunder to consummate this Agreement)
in accordance with its specified terms or otherwise breach such provisions.
The parties hereto acknowledge and agree that (a) each party hereto shall be
entitled to an injunction, specific performance, or other equitable relief to
prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and
provisions hereof, without proof of damages, prior to the valid termination
of this Agreement in accordance with _Section 10.01_ , this being in addition
to any other remedy to which they are entitled under this Agreement, and (b)
the right of specific enforcement is an integral part of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement and without that right, none of
the parties hereto would have entered into this Agreement. Each party hereto
agrees that it will not oppose the granting of specific performance and other
equitable relief on the basis that the other parties hereto have an adequate
remedy at Law or that an award of specific performance is not an appropriate
remedy for any reason at Law or equity. The parties hereto acknowledge and
agree that any party hereto seeking an injunction to prevent breaches of this
Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions of this
Agreement in accordance with this _Section 11.14_ shall not be required to

with respect to the specific obligations set forth herein with respect to
such party. Except to the extent a party hereto (and then only to the extent

investigation; (ii) the Company Representations constitute the sole and
exclusive representations and warranties of the Company in connection with the

all other representations and warranties of any kind or nature expressed or
implied (including (x) regarding the completeness or accuracy of, or any

the fullest extent permitted under applicable Law, any and all rights, Claims
and causes of action it may have against any other party hereto or their
respective Subsidiaries and any of their respective current or former
Affiliates or Representatives relating to the operation of any party hereto

statute, Law, ordinance, rule or regulation or otherwise. Each party hereto
acknowledges and agrees that it will not assert, institute or maintain any
Action, suit, Claim, investigation, or proceeding of any kind whatsoever,

imposed, that makes any claim contrary to the agreements and covenants set
forth in this _Section 11.17_. Notwithstanding anything herein to the
contrary, nothing in this _Section 11.17(b)_ shall preclude any party hereto
from seeking any remedy for Fraud. Each party hereto shall have the right to
