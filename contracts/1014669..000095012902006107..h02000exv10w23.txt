Seller Parties (including, for purposes of this Section 2.2(d), any

for the sale of the Purchased Assets, at the Closing, Purchaser shall (i)
assume the Assumed Liabilities and (ii) pay a purchase price equal to
US$375,000,000 (A) less the Good Faith Deposit, (B) less the Holdback Amount,
(C) less the Closing Delay Adjustment Amount, if any, and (D) as adjusted
pursuant to Section 2.10(a) hereof (collectively, the "PURCHASE PRICE"), to
Sellers (or to such Sellers or accounts (including accounts of lenders) as
are designated by Chemicals prior to the Closing, in such amounts thereof as
are specified by Chemicals prior to the      25   Closing). The
Purchase Price (including the payment of the Good Faith Deposit by the Escrow
Agent) shall be payable in cash in U.S. dollars by wire transfer
of immediately available funds to an account or accounts designated by
Chemicals to the Purchaser at least two (2) Business Days prior to the
Closing.   (b) Concurrently with the execution of this Agreement, the
Purchaser shall deposit with JP Morgan Chase Bank, as escrow agent (the
"ESCROW AGENT"), US$11,250,000 in immediately available funds (the "GOOD
FAITH Deposit"), which will satisfy the requirements for and function as
a good faith deposit of Purchaser and will be held in an escrow account
(the "ESCROW ACCOUNT") pending the Closing in accordance with the terms of an
escrow agreement (the "DEPOSIT ESCROW AGREEMENT"), a copy of which is
attached as Exhibit C hereto.   (c) In the event that (i) this Agreement
is terminated by Sellers (x) pursuant to Section 7.1(e) or (y) pursuant to
Section 7.1(b)(1) as of December 31, 2002, (ii) all of the conditions
contained in Article VI of this Agreement shall have been satisfied (other
than those conditions which, by their nature, can only be satisfied at
Closing), except that the condition set forth in Section 6.2(i) of this
Agreement shall not have been satisfied, and (iii) the conditions set forth
in Sections 6.1(a) and 6.1(b) are satisfied as of such date (except to the
extent that such conditions by their nature can only be satisfied at
Closing), then the Good Faith Deposit (excluding any interest accrued
thereon) will be released from the Escrow Account and paid to Chemicals.
Interest accrued on the Escrow Amount prior to the date of release shall be
retained by the Purchaser. In the event that this Agreement is terminated or
abandoned under any circumstance other than the circumstances set forth in
the first sentence of this Section 2.3(c), the Good Faith Deposit (and any
interest thereon) will be released from the Escrow Account and refunded to
the Purchaser, and none of the Seller Parties shall have any rights or
interests therein.   (d) The parties hereby agree that, subject to
the proviso hereto, the sole and exclusive remedy of the Seller Parties for
any breach of the representations, warranties, covenants and other agreements
of the Purchaser in this Agreement shall be payment of the Good Faith Deposit
to Chemicals and that the Good Faith Deposit will serve as liquidated damages
in respect of such breach by Purchaser of its representations,
warranties, covenants and other agreements hereunder; provided, however, that
if (i) this Agreement is terminated by Sellers pursuant to Section 7.1(e) and
(ii) such termination is effected by reason of a material breach by Purchaser
of its covenants and agreements contained herein, the Good Faith Deposit
shall not constitute liquidated damages hereunder and no such limitation on
the remedies available to the Seller Parties shall exist; provided, further,
that it is agreed and understood that the maximum liability of Purchaser in
respect of any such breach of a covenant or agreement by Purchaser shall be
limited to (A) the Good Faith Deposit plus (B) the lesser of (i) the excess
of (x) the amount of Damages of the Seller Parties, over (y) the Good Faith
Deposit and (ii) $16,875,000.   (e) In furtherance of mitigating the amount
of Damages payable to the Seller Parties and without limiting the obligation
of the Seller Parties to mitigate       26   pursuant to applicable
Law, the Sellers shall use commercially reasonable efforts to promote, market
and consummate a sale of the Business to the highest or best bidder available
under the circumstances as soon as is reasonably practicable following the
termination of this Agreement; including, without limitation, by contacting
and soliciting the interest of all parties (other than Purchaser) who
previously submitted a written indication of interest to acquire the Business
in the marketing and auction processes preceding or leading up the execution
of this Agreement.   Section 2.4 Canadian Withholding Tax. The provisions of
this Section 2.4 shall apply only in the event that Chemicals waives the
condition contained in Section 6.3(f) of this Agreement.   (a) The
Purchaser and the Sellers acknowledge that pursuant to Section 116 of the
Income Tax Act (Canada) the Purchaser must withhold and within 30 days of the
end of the month which includes the Closing Date (or such later time as
permitted in writing by the Minister of National Revenue) remit to the
Receiver General of Canada 25% of the amount, if any, by which the amount of
the Purchase Price allocable to the capital stock of each Non-U.S. Subsidiary
exceeds the certificate limit fixed in the certificate of compliance obtained
by the Sellers in respect of the sale of such stock for the purposes of
Section 116 of the Income Tax Act (Canada) (each, a "SECTION
116 CERTIFICATE"). If the Section 116 Certificate with respect to the
disposition of the capital stock of any such Non-U.S. Subsidiary by the
Sellers to the Purchaser with a certificate limit at least equal to the
amount of the Purchase Price allocable to such stock has not been provided to
the Purchaser by the Sellers on or before Closing, the Purchaser shall
withhold such amount (the "WITHHELD AMOUNT") which is equal to: (i) 25% of
the amount by which the amount of the Purchase Price allocable to such
Non-U.S. Subsidiary Stock exceeds the certificate limit of the Section 116
Certificate with respect thereto, if any, provided by the Sellers to the
Purchaser on or before Closing; or (ii) if the Section 116 Certificate is not
provided, 25% of the amount of the Purchase Price allocated to such stock in
respect of which a Section 116 Certificate has not been provided. The
Purchaser shall invest the Withheld Amount in interest-bearing instruments
selected by the Sellers and the Withheld Amount shall be released by the
Purchaser as follows:   (i) if the Section 116 Certificate in respect of
the disposition of the capital stock of any Non-U.S. Subsidiary is delivered
to the Purchaser before 12:00 p.m. (Calgary time) on the last Business Day of
the month following the month which includes the Closing Date or such later
day as permitted in writing by the Minister of National Revenue
(the "REMITTANCE DATE") and the certificate limit of such Section 116
Certificate is not less than the amount of the Purchase Price allocated to
such stock, then the Withheld Amount in respect of such stock shall be
released to the Sellers on account of the Purchase Price;   (ii) if the
Canada Customs and Revenue Agency (the "CCRA") indicates that payment of an
amount (the "TAX AMOUNT") which is not more than the Withheld Amount would
allow the CCRA to issue a Section 116 Certificate, meeting the criteria
described in this Section 2.4, in respect of the disposition of the capital
stock of any Non-U.S. Subsidiary, the Purchaser shall pay the Tax Amount to
the       27   CCRA from the Withheld Amount and, upon delivery of
the relevant Section 116 Certificate to the Purchaser, the amount by which
the Withheld Amount in respect of such stock exceeds the Tax Amount in
respect of that stock shall be released to the Sellers on account of the
Purchase Price; and   (iii) any funds held on account of the Withheld
Amount by the Purchaser which are not paid or payable pursuant to Sections
2.4(a)(i) and (ii) by 12:00 p.m. (Calgary time) on the Remittance Date shall
be remitted by the Purchaser to the CCRA pursuant to Section 116 of
the Income Tax Act (Canada).   All interest earned on the Withheld Amount
shall be paid to the Sellers, net of all applicable withholdings, which shall
be remitted by the Purchaser to the CCRA in accordance with Part XIII of the
Income Tax Act (Canada). For greater certainty, the Purchaser shall not be
liable for any amounts deducted or withheld from the Purchase Price pursuant
to this Section 2.4.   Section 2.5 Purchase Price Allocation. (a) As
promptly as practicable after the date of this Agreement, but in any event
within three (3) days after the date of this Agreement, Chemicals shall
prepare (with such reasonable assistance to be provided by Purchaser as
Chemicals may request) and provide to Purchaser an allocation (including the
allocation of purchase price report prepared by Deloitte and Touche LLP) of the
consideration paid for the Purchased Assets pursuant to this Agreement
(including, with limitation, the Assumed Liabilities and the Good Faith
Deposit) pursuant to Section 1060 of the Code and the Treasury regulations
promulgated thereunder (the "PRELIMINARY ALLOCATION"). Within 3 days
following such provision (the "3-DAY RESPONSE PERIOD"), Purchaser shall have
the right to propose changes in writing to the Preliminary Allocation,
provided that Chemicals shall have ultimate discretion to reject any such
proposals unless such rejection would be patently unreasonable. If Purchaser
shall raise any objections within the 3-Day Response Period, the Purchaser
and Chemicals shall negotiate in good faith and use their commercially
reasonable efforts to resolve such dispute as promptly as practicable, but in
no event later than November 20, 2002 (such allocation once finalized, the
"FINAL ALLOCATION").   The Sellers and the Purchaser shall (i) be bound by
the Final Allocation for all Tax purposes, (ii) timely file all forms
(including IRS Form 8594) and Tax Returns required to be filed in connection
with the Final Allocation, (iii) prepare and file all Tax Returns in a manner
consistent with the Final Allocation and (iv) take no position inconsistent
with the Final Allocation in any Tax Return, any audit or examination by, or
any proceeding before, any taxing authority or otherwise. In the event that
the Final Allocation is disputed by any taxing authority, the party receiving
notice of such dispute shall promptly notify and consult with the other party
and keep the other party apprised of material developments concerning
resolution of such dispute.   Section 2.6 Closing; Deliveries by the
Parties.   (a) Unless the parties mutually agree to extend,
the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (the
"CLOSING") will take place within       28   two (2) Business Days

VI hereof (other than those conditions which, by their nature, can only be

Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher and Flom LLP, 4 Times Square, New York, New

parties. The date on which the Closing occurs is referred to herein as the
"CLOSING DATE."   (b) At the Closing, the Seller Parties shall deliver or

or otherwise required in connection herewith or which Purchaser may otherwise
reasonably request.   (c) At the Closing, Purchaser shall deliver or

reasonably requested by and acceptable to Chemicals, which may be required by
applicable Law in order to establish an exemption from or a reduction of
Transfer Taxes or the proper payment of any applicable Transfer Taxes;  
(vi) the certificate of the Purchaser signed by an officer of the Purchaser
referred to in Section 6.3(c) hereof;   (vii) a duly executed Lease
Assignment Agreement; and   (viii) all other documents, instruments
and writings required to be delivered by the Purchaser at or prior to the
Closing pursuant to this Agreement or otherwise required in connection
herewith or which any Seller Party may otherwise reasonably request.   (d)
Required Documents. Except for the exhibits hereto, all documents to be
delivered by the Sellers or to be entered into by the Sellers and the
Purchaser necessary to carry out the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement or contemplated by the terms of this Agreement shall be in form and
substance reasonably satisfactory to the Purchaser and counsel to the
Purchaser and all documents to be delivered by the Purchaser necessary to
carry out the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or to be entered
into by the Sellers and the Purchaser necessary to carry out the transactions

Nonassignable Assets.   (a) Nothing in this Agreement nor the consummation
of the transactions contemplated hereby shall be construed as an attempt
or agreement to assign or transfer any Purchased Asset (including any
Assumed Contract) to Purchaser which by its terms or by Law is not assignable
or transferable without the consent of a third party or a Governmental Entity
or is cancelable by a third party in the event of an assignment or transfer
(a "NONASSIGNABLE ASSET"), unless and until such consent shall have been
obtained or unless such consent is not required by virtue of the Bankruptcy
Code.   (b) Sellers and Purchaser shall each use commercially reasonable
efforts to obtain as expeditiously as possible any consent that may be
required to the assignment or transfer of a Nonassignable Asset to
Purchaser; provided, however that Sellers shall not be required to remain
secondarily liable or to make any payment to obtain any such consent with
respect to any Nonassignable Asset.   (c) Unless and until any consent that
may be required is obtained, to the extent permitted by applicable Law and by
the terms of the applicable Nonassignable Asset, Chemicals and Purchaser will
cooperate and use commercially reasonable efforts to establish an arrangement
reasonably satisfactory to Purchaser and Chemicals under which Purchaser
would obtain the claims, rights and benefits and       30   assume
the corresponding liabilities and obligations under such Nonassignable Asset
(including by means of any subcontracting, sublicensing or
subleasing arrangement) or under which each Seller would enforce for the
benefit of Purchaser, with Purchaser assuming and agreeing to pay such
Seller\'s obligations, any and all claims, rights and benefits of such Seller
against a third party thereto; provided, that, in no event shall Purchaser or
any Seller Party be required to enter into any such arrangement with respect
to any Nonassignable Asset for which any such consent is a Required
Consent.   (d) Each Seller or the applicable Affiliate of such Seller shall
promptly pay over to Purchaser the net amount (after costs and taxes) of all
payments received by it in respect of all Nonassignable Assets, and Purchaser
shall promptly pay, perform or discharge, when due, any and all obligations
and liabilities arising thereunder and Purchaser shall indemnify and hold
harmless each Seller Indemnified Party from and against any and all
Claims, Liabilities and Losses that are imposed on, incurred by or asserted
against any Seller Indemnified Party arising out of, related to or resulting
from, directly or indirectly, the arrangements contemplated by this Section
2.7.   Section 2.8 No Licenses. Unless expressly provided for under this
Agreement or any Ancillary Agreement, no title, right or license of any kind
is granted to Purchaser pursuant to this Agreement with respect to
any Excluded Intellectual Property, either directly or indirectly, by
implication, by estoppel or otherwise.   Section 2.9 Adjustments to
Purchase Price.   (a) The Purchase Price shall be (i) increased on a dollar
for dollar basis by the excess, if any, of the Working Capital Amount over
the Budgeted Working Capital Amount and (ii) decreased on a dollar for dollar
basis by the excess, if any, of the Budgeted Working Capital Amount over the
Working Capital Amount (the "WORKING CAPITAL ADJUSTMENT").   (b) The
Purchase Price shall be (i) increased on a dollar for dollar basis by the
excess, if any, of the Capital Expenditure Amount over the Budgeted Capital
Expenditure Amount and (ii) decreased on a dollar for dollar basis by the
excess, if any, of the Budgeted Capital Expenditure Amount over the Capital
Expenditure Amount (the "CAPITAL EXPENDITURE ADJUSTMENT").  Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, (i) the Purchase Price
shall not be adjusted in accordance with the foregoing if the aggregate
amount of all such adjustments would be equal to or less than $1,000,000
(however, the provisions of Section 2.10 hereof shall continue to apply
(although no such adjustment shall be made to the extent that, after
the application of the provisions thereof, the aggregate amount of all
such adjustments would be equal to or less than $1,000,000)) and (ii) if
the aggregate amount of all such adjustments exceeds $1,000,000, an
adjustment shall be made without regard to such $1,000,000
threshold.      31    Section 2.10 Determination of Adjustments.  
(a) No later than the fifth Business Day prior to the Closing Date, the
Sellers shall prepare and deliver to the Purchaser an officer\'s certificate,
certifying as to (i) the estimated Working Capital Amount and (ii) the
estimated Capital Expenditure Amount (the "SELLERS STATEMENT
OF ADJUSTMENTS"), in each case as of the Closing Date, which certificate
shall be accompanied by a statement of such amounts prepared in good faith
from the books and records of the Business in accordance with GAAP and in a
manner consistent with the preparation of the Financial Statements. The
Purchase Price payable at the Closing shall be determined using the Sellers
Statement of Adjustments and the Seller\'s Statement of Adjustments shall
also stipulate the manner in which any adjustments to the Purchase Price are
to be allocated among the Purchased Assets.   (b) As soon as practicable,
but in any event within 60 days after the Closing Date, the Purchaser shall
cause to be prepared and delivered to the Sellers a statement (the "PURCHASER
STATEMENT OF ADJUSTMENTS") certifying as to the Purchaser\'s determination of
(i) the Working Capital Amount and (ii) the Capital Expenditure Amount, in
each case as of the Closing Date, each prepared in good faith from the books
and records of the Business in accordance with GAAP and in a manner
consistent with the preparation of the Financial Statements. The Purchaser
Statement of Adjustments shall stipulate the manner in which any adjustments
to the Purchase Price are to be allocated among the Purchased Assets and
shall certify the amount payable by the Sellers to the Purchaser, or by the
Purchaser to the Sellers, pursuant to Section 2.10(e).   (c) Upon receipt of
the Purchaser Statement of Adjustments, the Sellers shall have the right
during the succeeding 30-day period (the "REVIEW PERIOD") to examine the
Purchaser Statement of Adjustments, and all books and records used to prepare
the Purchaser Statement of Adjustments. If the Sellers object to the
Purchaser\'s determination of any of (i) the Working Capital Amount, (ii) the
Capital Expenditure Amount or (iii) Purchaser\'s allocation of adjustments to
the Purchased Assets, they shall so notify the Purchaser in writing (such
notice, a "DISAGREEMENT NOTICE") on or before the last day of the Review
Period, setting forth a specific description of the Sellers\' objection and
the amount of the adjustment to the Purchaser\'s determination of such
amounts and allocation which the Sellers believe should be made. If no
Disagreement Notice is delivered within the Review Period, the Purchaser
Statement of Adjustment shall be deemed to have been accepted by the parties
hereto. The Purchaser will, and will cause the Business to, provide
the Sellers full access (during normal business hours and upon reasonable
notice) to the books, ledgers, files, reports and operating records of the
Business and the then current employees of the Business, and will fully
cooperate in allowing Sellers to review the Purchaser Statement of
Adjustments. Any amounts and allocation that are not in dispute shall be paid
promptly (and prior to the resolution of any amounts that are in dispute) in
accordance with Section 2.10(e) and the last sentence of Section 2.10(f).  
(d) Dispute Resolution.      32    (i) In the event that a
Disagreement Notice is delivered in accordance with Section 2.9(c) and the
Disagreement Notice or the Purchase Statement of Adjustments provide for
aggregate adjustments in excess of $1,000,000, the Purchaser and the Sellers
shall attempt to resolve the objections set forth therein within 30 days of
receipt of such Disagreement Notice. The objections set forth in the
Disagreement Notice that are resolved by the Purchaser and the Sellers in
accordance with this Section 2.9(d)(i) shall collectively be referred to
herein as the "RESOLVED OBJECTIONS." The Purchaser Statement of Adjustments
shall be adjusted to reflect any Resolved Objections. Any amounts that
constitute Resolved Objections shall be paid promptly (and in any event no
later than three (3) Business Days following such resolution in accordance
with Section 2.10(e) and the last sentence of Section 2.10(f)).   (ii) If
the Purchaser and the Sellers are unable to resolve all the objections set
forth in the Disagreement Notice within such 30-day period and the
Disagreement Notice or Purchaser Statement of Adjustments provide for
aggregate adjustments in excess of $1,000,000, they shall jointly appoint
within five days of the end of such 30-day period a mutually agreeable
nationally recognized audit firm that has not been engaged by any of the
parties hereto (or their respective Affiliates) within a period of three
years prior to the date hereof (the "CPA FIRM"). If the Purchaser and Sellers
cannot agree on the appointment of a CPA Firm, then the CPA Firm shall be
drawn by lot from the names of an equal number of nationally recognized
audit firms submitted by the Purchaser and Chemicals hereto that have not
been engaged by any of the parties hereto (or their respective Affiliates)
within a period of three years prior to the date hereof. The CPA Firm, acting
as experts and not as arbitrators, shall review the objections set forth in
the Disagreement Notice that are not Resolved Objections (collectively, the
"DIFFERENCES"). The CPA Firm shall determine, only with respect to
Differences submitted to the CPA Firm, the (i) the Working Capital Amount,
(ii) the Capital Expenditure Amount and (iii) the allocation of adjustments
among the Purchased Assets, each prepared from the books and records of the
Business in accordance with GAAP and in a manner consistent with the
preparation of the Financial Statements. The CPA Firm shall be instructed to
make its determination within 15 days after its appointment. The Purchaser
and the Sellers shall each pay 50% of the fees and disbursements of the CPA
Firm. The Purchaser and the Sellers shall, and the Purchaser shall cause the
Business to, provide to the CPA Firm full cooperation. The CPA
Firm\'s resolution of the Differences shall be conclusive and binding upon
the parties, except in the case of manifest error. The Differences as
resolved by the CPA Firm in accordance with this Section 2.9(d)(ii) shall
collectively be referred to herein as the "CPA-DETERMINED DIFFERENCES."  
(e) The (i) the Working Capital Amount, (ii) the Capital Expenditure Amount
and (iii) the Unpaid Purchased Subsidiary Tax Amount, each as finally
determined in accordance with Section 2.10(c) and (d), shall be used to
recalculate the adjustment, if any, to the Purchase Price initially
made pursuant to Section 2.10(a).   (f) On or before the fifth day
following (or, if not a Business Day, on the next Business Day) the latest to
occur of (x) the 30th day following receipt by the Sellers of the Purchaser
Statement of Adjustments, (y) the resolution by the Purchaser       
33   and the Sellers of all objections set forth in the Disagreement
Notice, if any, and (z) the resolution by the CPA Firm of all Differences, if
any, the recalculation required by Section 2.10(e) shall be made and the
Purchaser shall pay to the Sellers the amount of any increase in the Purchase
Price beyond that received by the Sellers in the aggregate prior thereto, or
the Sellers shall return to the Purchaser the excess amount of the Purchase
Price received by the Sellers in the aggregate prior thereto (in either case,
a "PURCHASE PRICE ADJUSTMENT PAYMENT"). A Purchase Price Adjustment Payment
shall be made (i) in the case of a payment to the Purchaser, by the Seller
Parties by wire transfer of immediately available funds to a bank account or
accounts designated by the Purchaser and (ii) in the case of a payment to the
Sellers, by the Purchaser by wire transfer of immediately available funds to
a bank account or accounts designated by the Sellers.   (g) Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, (i) the Holdback Amount
shall be credited toward any Purchase Price Adjustment Payment payable to
Purchaser by Sellers hereunder, and Purchaser shall promptly return to
Sellers any portion of the Holdback Amount less the amount credited in
accordance with the foregoing and (ii) to the extent no Purchase Price
Adjustment Payment is payable by Sellers to Purchaser hereunder, the entire
Holdback Amount shall be delivered by Purchaser to Sellers. In addition, to
the extent any Purchase Price Adjustment Payment is payable by Purchaser to
Sellers hereunder, the entire Holdback Amount shall be delivered by Purchaser
to Sellers plus any such amounts payable by Purchaser hereunder, and if the
portion of the adjusted Purchase Price allocable to the capital stock of a
Non-U.S. Subsidiary exceeds the certificate limit fixed in the Section 116
Certificate in respect of the sale of such stock, the Purchaser shall be
entitled to withhold 25% of the difference. Any amount so withheld shall be
invested in interest-bearing instruments selected by the Sellers, and shall
be released to the Sellers if a Section 116 Certificate with a
revised certificate limit is delivered to the Purchaser before 12 p.m.
Calgary time on the last Business Day of the third month following the month
in which the amount was withheld, or otherwise shall be remitted to the CCRA.
All interest, less applicable withholding taxes, shall be released to the
Sellers at the same time as the withheld amount if so released or
remitted.   ARTICLE III   REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF SELLERS  
Except (i) as disclosed in the Seller Disclosure Schedule (each section of
which qualifies the correspondingly numbered representation and warranty or
covenant to the extent specified therein and such other representations and
warranties or covenants to the extent a matter in such section is disclosed
in such a way as to make its relevance to the information called for by such
other representation and warranty or covenant readily apparent), (ii) as
expressly permitted under this Agreement and except for actions required to
be taken under this Agreement and (iii) to the extent that any of the
following representations and warranties are or become untrue by virtue of
the actions taken in accordance with Section 6.5 of the Plan, the Sellers,

Purchased Subsidiary has received written notice, nor does it otherwise have
knowledge, that any party to any such Real Property Lease intends to cancel,
terminate, or refuse to renew such Real Property Lease or to exercise or
decline to exercise any option or right thereunder, except as has not had and

Seller Disclosure Schedule sets forth all material Intellectual Property
licenses, sublicenses and distributor agreements under which any Seller or
Purchased Subsidiary is a (i) licensor, or (ii) licensee, distributor, or
reseller.      46    (c) The Sellers or the Purchased
Subsidiaries exclusively own, or otherwise have the right to use pursuant to
a valid license, sublicense or other agreement all material Intellectual
Property used in the conduct of the Business as currently conducted
consistent with past practice, and have the right (subject to any such
license terms, if applicable) to use, make, have made, sell, offer to sell,
import, license, sublicense and otherwise exploit all such owned Intellectual
Property in the conduct of the Business as currently conducted consistent
with past practice. To the knowledge of the Sellers and the Purchased
Subsidiaries, all of the Sellers\' and Purchased Subsidiaries\' rights in the
material Intellectual Property owned by the Sellers or the Purchased
Subsidiaries and used in the Business as currently conducted consistent with
past practice are valid and enforceable. All of the registrations for
material Intellectual Property owned by the Sellers or the Purchased
Subsidiaries and used in the Business as currently conducted consistent with
past practice are valid, subsisting and unexpired.   (d) All of the material
Intellectual Property owned by the Sellers or the Purchased Subsidiaries and
used in the conduct of the Business as currently conducted consistent with
past practice is free of all Liens (other than Permitted Liens).   (e) To
the Knowledge of the Sellers and the Purchased Subsidiaries, none of the
material Intellectual Property owned by the Sellers or the Purchased
Subsidiaries and/or used in the Business or any of the products or services
developed, sold or licensed by the Sellers or the Purchased Subsidiaries
infringes or otherwise violates the Intellectual Property rights of any third
party, and none of the Sellers or the Purchased Subsidiaries has received
written notice of such a claim within the past twenty-four months. To the
Knowledge of the Sellers and the Purchased Subsidiaries, no third party
is infringing or otherwise violating any rights with respect to any
material Intellectual Property owned by the Sellers or the Purchased
Subsidiaries and used in the Business as currently conducted consistent with
past practice.   (f) The Sellers and the Purchased Subsidiaries have taken
all commercially reasonable steps to maintain the confidentiality of
their material trade secrets and to protect and maintain all other
material Intellectual Property owned by the Sellers and the Purchased
Subsidiaries and are prosecuting those patent applications which the Sellers
or Purchased Subsidiaries in their reasonable business judgment deem to be of
commercial or strategic value to the Business consistent with past
practice.   (g) Since November 1, 1992, each present or past employee,
officer or consultant of the Business, in each case who developed any part of
any material Intellectual Property that is or will be used or exploited by
the Sellers or the Purchased Subsidiaries has executed a valid
and enforceable invention assignment and confidentiality agreement (an
"INVENTION AGREEMENT") substantially in the form provided to Purchaser,
except where the failure to do so would not reasonably be expected to,
individually or in the aggregate, result in a Material Adverse Effect. To the
Knowledge of the Sellers and the Purchased Subsidiaries, no present or former
employee, consultant or contractor of any Seller or Purchased Subsidiary (x)
is in violation of any material term of any confidentiality agreement, patent
or invention disclosure agreement related to the Business under which such
person is bound (y) is obligated under any       47   fiduciary duty
or contract that would reasonably be likely to adversely affect any Seller\'s
or Purchased Subsidiary\'s rights to its Intellectual Property or (z) has
misappropriated any Intellectual Property of any other Person in the course
of the performance of his or her duties to the Sellers or
Purchased Subsidiaries, except, in each case, where such violation or
misappropriation would not reasonably be expected to result, individually in
the aggregate, in a Material Adverse Effect.   (h) The Sellers and the
Purchased Subsidiaries have made available to the Purchaser all material user
and operating manuals that are related to any material software currently
used in the Business and in their possession.   Section 3.17 Customers.

the ten (10) highest revenue generating customers from chemicals sales of the
Business for the September 30, 2002 billing run that together accounted for
approximately 65% of the gross revenues of chemicals sales of the Business
during the relevant billing period (the "TOP CUSTOMERS") and (b) the amount
for which each such customer was invoiced during such period. To the
knowledge of the Sellers and the Purchased Subsidiaries, except as set forth
in Section 3.17 of the Seller Disclosure Schedule, none of the Sellers nor
any Purchased Subsidiary has received any notice (written or oral) that since
September 30, 2002, any Top Customer of the Business (i) has ceased, or will

reduced or will reduce the purchase of the goods produced by the Business,
including, in each case, after the consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby.   Section 3.18 Warranties; Product
Claims.   (a) The products manufactured by the Sellers or the Purchased
Subsidiaries and sold to end user customers and, to the knowledge of the

the Sellers or the Purchased Subsidiaries and sold for use by original
equipment manufacturer customers or the products sold by the Sellers or the
Purchased Subsidiaries but manufactured by third parties, conform to design
in all material respects and comply in all material respects with all
applicable Laws. To the Sellers\' and the Purchased Subsidiaries\' knowledge,
there is no pending federal or state legislation, not otherwise applicable to
the Sellers\' industry, which if adopted or enacted would reasonably be
expected to result in a Material Adverse Effect as a result of the products
sold by the Sellers or the Purchased Subsidiaries.   (b) Section 3.18(b) of
the Seller Disclosure Schedule sets forth a summary of each material recall
(voluntary or involuntary) of products manufactured by the Sellers or the
Purchased Subsidiaries during the 3 year period prior to the date hereof,
describing in each case the nature of the problem giving rise to such recall,
the approximate number of products recalled and the aggregate costs incurred
by the Sellers for each such recall. Except as set forth in Section 3.18(b)
of the Seller Disclosure Schedule, during the 3 year period prior to the date
hereof, none of the Sellers have experienced any material return or any
material claim as a result of the ownership, possession or use of any product
manufactured, sold or delivered by the Sellers or the Purchased Subsidiaries
(a "WARRANTY CLAIM") with respect to products sold or services      
48   performed by the Sellers or the Purchased Subsidiaries, nor are there
any pending or, to the Sellers\' or the Purchased Subsidiaries\' knowledge,
threatened material return or Warranty Claims with respect to products sold
or services performed by the Sellers or the Purchased Subsidiaries for which
the Sellers or the Purchased Subsidiaries may have continuing liability or
obligations.   Section 3.19 Insurance. Except as has not had or would
not reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a
Material Adverse Effect, (i) the Sellers and the Purchased Subsidiaries (or
one or more members of the Holdings Group on behalf thereof) maintain, and
have maintained, without interruption, policies or binders of insurance

and general liability in amounts the Sellers and the Purchased Subsidiaries
(or one or more members of the Holdings Group on behalf thereof) reasonably
believe adequate for the Business, (ii) the Sellers and the Purchased
Subsidiaries have not received notice of termination or cancellation of any
such policy, (iii) the Sellers and the Purchased Subsidiaries (or one or more

all periods up to and including the Closing Date have been paid and (v) there
has been no lapse in coverage under such policies during any period for which

of the Sellers or Purchased Subsidiaries have any obligation for
retrospective premiums for any period prior to the Closing Date which has had
or would reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a
Material Adverse Effect. All such policies are in full force and effect and
will remain in full force and effect until the Closing Date (but not
thereafter). Except as set forth in Section 3.19 of the Seller Disclosure
Schedule, no insurer has put any Seller or Purchased Subsidiary on notice
that coverage may be denied with respect to any claim submitted to such
insurer by any Sellers or Purchased Subsidiary.   Section 3.20 Affiliate
Transactions. Except as set forth in Section 3.20 of the Seller Disclosure
Schedule, no director or officer nor, to the knowledge of Sellers and the
Purchased Subsidiaries, employee of the Sellers or the Purchased Subsidiaries

and the Purchased Subsidiaries, any spouse, child, sibling or parent of any
such director or officer) (a) owns, directly or indirectly, any material
interest in, or is an officer, director, employee or consultant of, any
Person which is, or is engaged in business as, a competitor, lessor, lessee,
supplier, distributor, sales agent or customer of, or lender to or borrower
from, any Seller or Purchased Subsidiary, (b) owns, directly or indirectly,
in whole or in part, any material tangible or intangible property that is
used in the operation of the Business or (c) receives any material payment or
other benefit from any Seller or Purchased Subsidiary, has any material cause
of action or other claim whatsoever against, or owes or has advanced any
material amount to, any Seller or Purchased Subsidiary, except for (i)

the Seller Disclosure Schedule, there are no strikes, work stoppages,

has any knowledge of any circumstances that may reasonably be expected to
give rise thereto) against the Sellers or Purchased Subsidiaries in respect
of the Purchased Assets (or the Canadian Assets) or the conduct of the
Business, the outcome of which would reasonably be expected to, individually
or in the aggregate, have a Material Adverse Effect.   (c) Except as set
forth in Section 3.21(c) of the Seller Disclosure Schedule, none of the
Sellers or Purchased Subsidiaries have received notice of any pending (and no
Seller or Purchased Subsidiary has any knowledge of any circumstances that
may reasonably be expected to give rise to) (i) proceedings under the
National Labor Relations Act or before the National Labor Relations Board,
(ii) proceedings under the Labor Relations Code of Alberta or such other
applicable provincial or federal legislation or any provincial or federal
labor relations board, (iii) grievances or arbitrations, or (iv)
organizational drives or unit clarification requests, in each case against or
affecting the Purchased Assets (or the Canadian Assets) or the conduct of the
Business and as to (i), (ii) and (iii), the outcome of which would reasonably
be expected to, individually or in the aggregate, have a Material Adverse
Effect.   ARTICLE IV   REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF PURCHASER

themselves or others, any confidential information or trade secrets of the
Business obtained by them prior to the Closing; provided, however, that this
provision shall not preclude the Seller Parties from use or disclosure of
information if (x) use or disclosure of such information shall be required by
applicable Law or (y) use or disclosure of such information is reasonably
required in connection with any bona fide Claim against or involving the

therein.   (f) The Seller Parties covenant and agree that upon the request
of Purchaser, the Seller Parties shall use commercially reasonable efforts to
provide Purchaser with the full benefit of any rights that any Seller Party
may have under any confidentiality agreement entered into in connection with
the sale of the Business. Without limiting the generality of the
foregoing, the Seller Parties shall assist Purchaser in bringing legal action
to enforce such rights, including instituting a claim in the name of one or
more Seller Parties. The reasonable out-of-pocket costs and expenses of the
Seller Parties incurred by the Seller Parties pursuant to this Section 5.2(f)
shall be paid by Purchaser.   Section 5.3 Bankruptcy Actions. (a) Within

Closing, for so long as such information is retained by Purchaser (which
shall be for a period of at least six years), Purchaser shall permit Holdings
or Chemicals and its authorized representatives to have reasonable access and
duplicating rights during normal business hours, upon reasonable prior notice
to Purchaser and without material disruption to its business, to the books,

to retain copies of any files, documents, instruments, papers, books and
records and any other written or recorded information to the extent it is
used both in the Business and in the business of the members of the
Holdings Group. Notwithstanding the foregoing, (A) Purchaser need not
disclose to Holdings or Chemicals any information which would violate
applicable Law, result in a breach of attorney-client privilege or similar
privilege or violate any confidentiality or nondisclosure agreement or
similar agreement or arrangement to which Purchaser is a party and (B)
Purchaser may redact such books and records that do not directly relate to
the Purchased Assets (or the Canadian Assets), Assumed Liabilities or the
Business   (b) Following the Closing, for so long as such information is
retained by Chemicals (which shall be for a period of at least six years),
Chemicals shall permit Purchaser and its authorized representatives to have
reasonable access during normal business hours, upon reasonable prior notice
to Chemicals and without material disruption to its business, to the Retained
Information to the extent such access may be reasonably required (i)
in connection with the preparation of Purchaser\'s accounting records or with
any audits, (ii) in connection with any Claim, (iii) in connection with
any regulatory filing or matter or (iv) in connection with any other valid

pocket costs and expenses incurred by Chemicals in connection with any such
request. Notwithstanding the foregoing, (A) Chemicals need not disclose to
Purchaser any information which would violate applicable Law, result in a

59   violate any confidentiality or nondisclosure agreement or similar
agreement or arrangement to which Chemicals or an Affiliate thereof is a
party and (B) Chemicals may redact such portions of the Retained Information
that do not directly relate to the Purchased Assets, the Assumed Liabilities
or the Business.   (c) Purchaser shall, and shall instruct its
employees to, at Chemicals\' request, cooperate with Chemicals and its
Affiliates as may be reasonably required in connection with the investigation
and defense of any Claim relating to the Business that is brought against
Chemicals or any of its Affiliates at any time after the Closing.   (d)
Chemicals and its Affiliates shall, and shall instruct its employees to, at
the Purchaser\'s request, cooperate with the Purchaser as may be reasonably
required in connection with the investigation and defense of any Claim
relating to the Business that is brought against the Purchaser at any time

Except as otherwise expressly set forth herein and subject to Section 5.5(c)
hereof, the Seller Parties and Purchaser shall use commercially reasonable
efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all appropriate action, and do, or
cause to be done, all things necessary, proper or advisable under applicable
Law or otherwise to consummate and make effective the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement as promptly as practicable, including to: (i)
obtain from Governmental Entities any Licenses required (A) to be obtained or
made by a Seller Party or Purchaser or any of their Affiliates to consummate
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or (B) to avoid any action or
proceeding by any Governmental Entity (including those in connection with the
HSR Act and antitrust and competition Laws of Canada or any other applicable
jurisdiction) in connection with the authorization, execution and delivery of
this Agreement and to permit the consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby to occur as promptly as practicable; and (ii) promptly
(and in any event no later than November 27, 2002) make all necessary
filings, and thereafter make any other required submissions, with respect to
this Agreement required under applicable Law and under the HSR Act and
antitrust and competition Laws of Canada or any other applicable
jurisdiction, in each case, to the extent required by applicable Law, and
provide all such information concerning such parties as may be necessary
or reasonably requested in connection with the foregoing. The Seller Parties
and Purchaser shall cooperate with each other in connection with the making
of all filings referenced in the preceding sentence, including providing
copies of all such documents to the non-filing party and its advisors prior
to filing and, if requested, to accept all reasonable additions, deletions or
changes suggested in connection therewith. Chemicals and Purchaser shall have
the right to review in advance, and, to the extent practicable, each shall
consult the other on, all the information relating to a Seller Party, a
Purchased Subsidiary or Purchaser, as the case may be, that appears in any
filing made with, or written materials submitted to, any third party or any
Governmental Entity in connection with the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement. Chemicals and Purchaser may, as each deems reasonably advisable
and necessary, designate any competitively sensitive information provided to
the other under this Section 5.5(a) as "outside counsel only."      
60   Such information shall be given only to outside counsel of the
recipient. In addition, Purchaser and the Seller Parties may redact any
information from such documents shared with the other party or its counsel
that is not pertinent to the subject matter of the filing or submission. Each
of the Seller Parties and Purchaser shall bear its own costs and expenses in
connection with its performance under this Section 5.5; except that Purchaser
and Chemicals shall each pay half of the fees in connection with any required
filings or submissions under the HSR Act or the Competition Act (Canada).  
(b) Without limiting Section 5.5(a), but subject to Section 5.5(c), Purchaser
and Seller Parties shall use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain, or to
cause to be obtained, any consent, substitution, approval or amendment
required to assign or transfer any Purchased Asset (including any Canadian
Asset, in the case of a "change of control" or similar provision) to
Purchaser or to novate all obligations and liabilities that constitute
Assumed Liabilities or to obtain in writing the unconditional release of the
Seller Parties and their Affiliates with respect to Assumed Liabilities so
that, in any such case, Purchaser shall be solely responsible for the
Assumed Liabilities.   (c) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to
the contrary (including paragraphs (a) and (b) of this Section 5.5), (i)
neither the Seller Parties nor their Affiliates shall be required to remain
liable or secondarily liable or to pay any consideration to any Person or to
reimburse Purchaser for any costs or expenses of Purchaser incurred in
connection with its compliance with paragraphs (a) and (b) of this Section
5.5, (ii) neither the Purchaser nor its Affiliates shall be required to
remain liable or secondarily liable or to pay any consideration to any Person
or to reimburse the Seller Parties for any costs or expenses of the Seller
Parties incurred in connection with their compliance with paragraphs (a) and
(b) of this Section 5.5 and (iii) neither Purchaser nor its Affiliates nor
the Seller Parties nor their Affiliates shall be required to commit to any
divestitures, licenses or hold separate or similar arrangements with respect
to its assets or conduct of its business arrangements (including as they may
exist after giving effect to the transactions contemplated hereby), whether
as a condition to obtaining any approval from a Governmental Entity or any
other Person or for any other reason.   Section 5.6 Further Assurances;
Financing. (a) Each party shall cooperate with the other parties, and execute
and deliver, or use commercially reasonable efforts to cause to be executed
and delivered, all such other instruments, including instruments of
conveyance, assignment and transfer, and to make all filings with and to
obtain all consents, approvals or authorizations of any Governmental Entity
or other regulatory authority or any other Person under any permit, agreement
or other instrument, and take all such other actions as such party may
reasonably be requested to take by another party hereto from time to time,
consistent with the terms of this Agreement, in order to effectuate the
provisions and purposes of this Agreement and the transactions contemplated
hereby or in order to facilitate any Canadian withholding tax refunds
available to Sterling Canada arising out of transactions occurring prior to
Closing and any other refunds or rebates of Taxes available to NRO or
its successor. The obligations of each of the Purchaser and the Seller
Parties pursuant to this Article V shall be subject to any orders entered or
approvals or authorizations granted by the Bankruptcy Court and the
Bankruptcy Code.      61    (b) Purchaser shall use commercially
reasonable efforts to obtain the proceeds of the Financing. Without limiting
the generality of the foregoing, if the Bank of Nova Scotia advises Purchaser
or Purchaser otherwise becomes aware that the proceeds of the Financing will
not be available pursuant to the Financing Letter, Purchaser shall use its
commercially reasonable efforts to obtain the proceeds of the Financing from
alternative financing sources; provided, however, that Purchaser shall not be
required to obtain such alternative financing on terms that are less
favorable (in the aggregate) than those set forth in the Financing Letter.
Further, Purchaser shall use commercially reasonable efforts to enter into
definitive financing agreements in respect of the Financing as soon as
reasonably practicable following the date of this Agreement.   Section 5.7
Tax Matters.   (a) Transfer Taxes. The Seller Parties and the Purchaser
will use commercially reasonable efforts and cooperate in good faith to
exempt the sale, conveyance, assignments, transfers and deliveries to be
made to the Purchaser hereunder from any sales, use, stamp duty,
transfer, documentary, registration, recording and other similar Taxes
(collectively, "TRANSFER TAXES") payable in connection with such sale,
conveyance, assignments, transfers and deliveries, to the extent provided by
Section 1146(c) of the Bankruptcy Code and other applicable Law. In the event
that any Transfer Taxes are assessed or are required to be paid with respect
to such sale, conveyance, assignments, transfers or deliveries, such Transfer
Taxes shall be borne and paid by the Seller Parties.   (b) Tax Cooperation.
After the Closing Date, Seller shall control, through counsel of its own
choosing, any claim for refund in relation to the NRO, including any related
administrative or judicial proceedings (the "NRO REFUND CLAIM"). After the
Closing Date, Purchaser shall control the conduct, through counsel of its own
choosing, of any audit, claim for refund, or administrative or judicial
proceeding involving any asserted Tax liability or refund (other than the NRO
Refund Claim) with respect to any of the Purchased Subsidiaries (any such
audit, claim for refund (other than the NRO Refund Claim), or proceeding
relating to an asserted Tax liability is referred to herein as a "CONTEST").
Purchaser and the Seller Parties agree to furnish or cause to be furnished to
each other, upon request, as promptly as practicable, such information and
assistance relating to the Business and the Purchased Assets (including the
Canadian Assets) (including providing access to books and records and
executing and delivering such powers of attorney as are necessary to carry
out the intent of this Section 5.7(b)) as is reasonably necessary for
the filing of all Tax Returns, the making of any election relating to Taxes,
the preparation for any audit by any taxing authority and the prosecution or
defense of any Contest or NRO Refund Claim. Any expenses incurred in
furnishing such information or assistance shall be borne by the party
requesting it. Any information obtained under this Section 5.7(b) shall be
kept confidential, except as may be otherwise necessary in connection with
the filing of Tax Returns or in the conduct of a Contest, NRO Refund Claim or
other Tax proceeding.   (c) Preparation of Tax Returns. The Sellers
shall prepare (or cause to be prepared) consistent with past practice (except
as required by applicable law or       62   regulations) all income
Tax Returns of the Purchased Subsidiaries that relate to periods ending on or
before the Closing Date which are to be filed after the Closing Date ("PRE-
CLOSING TAX RETURNS"). The Sellers shall permit the Purchaser to review and
comment upon the Pre-Closing Tax Returns prior to the filing. Purchaser shall
on a timely basis cause the Purchased Subsidiaries to execute and file the
Pre-Closing Tax Returns.   (d) Tax Refunds. If after the Closing any refunds
or rebates relating to the NRO Refund Claim and described on Section
2.1(b)(v) of the Seller Disclosure Schedule are issued by a Governmental
Entity to a Purchased Subsidiary, the Purchaser shall cause the amount of
such refund or rebate to be remitted to the Sellers.   Section 5.8
Publicity. Following the date hereof, until the Closing, or the date the
Agreement is terminated or abandoned pursuant to Article VII, neither the
Seller Parties nor the Purchaser, nor any of their respective Affiliates or
representatives, shall issue or cause the publication of any press release or
other public announcement with respect to this Agreement or the transactions
contemplated hereby without prior consultation with the other party (which
consent shall not be unreasonably withheld).   Section 5.9 Use of Holdings
Group Trademarks and Logos. The parties agree that during the period from the
Closing Date until one year after the Closing Date (the "SELL-OFF PERIOD"),
Purchaser shall be entitled to continue to use the name "Sterling" and any
trade names, trademarks, service marks, slogans and identifying logos and
designs employing the word "Sterling" or any confusingly similar variation
thereof (collectively, "HOLDINGS GROUP TRADEMARKS AND LOGOS") solely to the
extent that such Holdings Group Trademarks and Logos are contained, as of the
Closing Date, on any Inventory, packaging, business cards, schedules,
stationery, displays, signs, promotional materials, manuals, forms and other
material used in the Business, without any obligation on the part of
Purchaser to pay royalties or similar fees to the Seller Parties. Purchaser
agrees that immediately upon termination of the Sell-off Period, Purchaser
shall cease and desist from all further use of the Holdings Group Trademarks
and Logos and adopt new trade names, trademarks, service marks, slogans and
identifying logos and designs related thereto which are not confusingly
similar to or dilutive of the Holdings Group Trademarks and Logos. Purchaser
shall not use the Holdings Group Trademarks and Logos in any manner that
might tarnish, disparage or reflect adversely on Holdings, Chemicals, any of
their Affiliates or the Holdings Group Trademarks and Logos.
Nothing contained in this Agreement shall prevent Purchaser in any way from
using the name "Sterling" when describing the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement.   Section 5.10 Contacts with Suppliers, Customers and
Other Parties. Without the prior written consent of Chemicals, prior to the
Closing, Purchaser shall not, and shall cause its Representatives (as defined
in the Confidentiality Agreement) not to, contact any suppliers to, or
customers of, the Business, any employees of the Seller Parties or their
Affiliates, counterparties (other than the Seller Parties) to any Contracts
or any Governmental Entity (other than in connection with any filings made
under the HSR Act or the Competition Act (Canada) or in connection with other
consents, approvals or waivers required to be obtained by Purchaser from
Governmental Entities in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby
or as required by applicable Law) in       63   connection with or
pertaining to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.   Section
5.11 Employee Matters.   (a) Prior to the Closing Date, Purchaser shall,
or shall cause an Affiliate of Purchaser to, make an offer of employment
effective as of the Closing Date (the "EMPLOYMENT OFFER") to each employee of
Sellers (other than those set forth on Section 5.11 of the Seller Disclosure
Schedule), including those on sick leave, vacation, other authorized leaves
of absences or short-term disability (the "OFFERED EMPLOYEES") on terms and
conditions that are in the aggregate no less favorable than those provided by
the Sellers on the date hereof. Offered Employees who accept such offer of
employment shall be referred to herein as "TRANSFERRED EMPLOYEES."   (b)
Effective as of the Closing Date, and except with respect to any Seller

described in Section 5.11(d), the Transferred Employees and employees of each
Purchased Subsidiary who are employed by Purchaser or an affiliate of
Purchaser immediately following the Closing Date (together with
the Transferred Employees, the "BUSINESS EMPLOYEES") shall cease to accrue
benefits under the Seller Benefit Plans and shall commence participation in
employee benefit plans and arrangements of Purchaser or an Affiliate of
Purchaser. Purchaser shall, or cause an Affiliate of Purchaser to, recognize
and give full credit for all service by each Business Employee for purposes
of eligibility and vesting under any employee benefit plans or arrangements
of Purchaser or its Affiliates for such Business Employees\' service with the
Sellers and/or Purchased Subsidiaries to the same extent recognized by the
Sellers and/or the Purchased Subsidiaries immediately prior to the Closing
Date, except to the extent such credit would result in the duplication of
benefits. Purchaser shall have no obligation to establish any employee
benefit plan or arrangement and, except as set forth in the preceding
sentence, Purchaser shall have full discretion in determining the terms and
conditions of any such plan or arrangement that is established.   (c)
Purchaser shall, or cause an Affiliate of Purchaser to, (i) waive all pre-
existing condition limitations and waiting periods with respect to Business
Employees to the extent such limitations and waiting periods have been
satisfied under analogous Seller Benefit Plans and (ii) provide each Business
Employee with credit for any co-payments and deductibles paid during any plan
year in progress as of the Closing Date in satisfying any applicable
deductible or out-of-pocket requirements under any analogous welfare plans
that such employees are eligible to participate in after the Closing
Date.   (d) Purchaser shall, or cause an Affiliate of Purchaser to, assume
and agree to perform all liabilities, obligations and responsibilities under
the Third Amended and Restated Key Employee Protection Plan and the Second
Amended and Restated Severance Pay Plan maintained by Holdings and Chemicals
with respect to each Business Employee who is a participant under any such
plan. Purchaser shall communicate such assumption to each affected Business
Employee.      64    (e) Following the Closing Date, Purchaser shall,
or cause an Affiliate of Purchaser to, credit each Business Employee with
the number of his or her unused and accrued vacation days outstanding as of
the Closing Date in accordance with the terms of the applicable vacation
policy of the Seller or the Purchased Subsidiary prior to the Closing Date
and shall not cause any forfeiture of any such vacation days (including by
"cashing out" such vacation days)   (f) Purchaser and Sellers shall, to the
extent possible, (i) treat Purchaser or an Affiliate of Purchaser as a
"successor employer" and the applicable Seller as a "predecessor," within the
meaning of Sections 3121(a)(1) and 3306(b)(1) of the Code, with respect to
Transferred Employees to be employed by Purchaser or an Affiliate of
Purchaser for purposes of taxes imposed under the United States Federal
Unemployment Tax Act or the United States Federal Insurance Contributions
Act, and (ii) cooperate with each other to avoid the filing of more than one
IRS Form W-2 with respect to each such Transferred Employee for the calendar
year in which the Closing Date occurs.   (g) With respect to any and all
employees of the Purchased Subsidiaries who are represented by any labor
union, Sections 5.11(a)-(f) hereof shall not apply (except to the extent
required under an applicable collective bargaining agreement or Law) and
Purchaser shall honor or cause to be honored those collective bargaining
agreements set forth in Section 5.11(g) of the Seller Disclosure Schedule to
the extent required by Law.   (h) Purchaser shall indemnify and hold
harmless the Seller Indemnified Parties from and against any and all Claims,
Liabilities and Losses that are imposed on, incurred by or asserted against
any Seller Indemnified Party arising out of, related to or resulting from,
directly or indirectly, any suit or claim of violation brought against any of
the Seller Indemnified Parties under any Law, including the WARN Act or
COBRA, which relates to actions taken or omissions by the Purchaser or any of
its Affiliates on or after the Closing Date with regard to the employment,
discharge or layoff of any Business Employee.   (i) Purchaser shall be
responsible for, and shall indemnify and hold harmless the Seller Indemnified
Parties from and against, any and all Claims, Liabilities and Losses that are
imposed on, incurred by or asserted against any Seller Indemnified Party
arising out of, related to or resulting from, directly or indirectly, any
employee benefit plans or arrangements sponsored or maintained by Purchaser
and/or its Affiliates on and after the Closing Date for Business
Employees.   (j) For immigration and visa purposes, Purchaser will be the
successor in interest to any and all pending (whether pending with
the Immigration and Naturalization Service ("INS") or the Department of Labor)
or approved visa petitions, including any and all labor condition and
certification applications, made by Sellers with respect to the employees set
forth on Section 5.11(j) of the Seller Disclosure Schedule (the "ALIEN
EMPLOYEES") and Purchaser will adopt and accept all representations made by
Sellers in any of these petitions and applications. Additionally, Purchaser
agrees to       65   take all necessary steps (or cause the steps
necessary to be taken) in accordance with U.S. immigration laws on behalf of
the Alien Employees, including petitioning the INS, so as to ensure that
their employment continues without interruption immediately following the
Closing and that they have continued, valid U.S. visa status in connection
with such employment with the Purchaser.   (k) The Sellers shall, and shall
cause each ERISA Affiliate to, cause each Seller Benefit Plan (other than any
such plan in which employees of a Purchased Subsidiary participate) that is
an "employee pension benefit plan" (as defined in Section 3(2) of ERISA),
whether or not subject to ERISA, in which any Transferred Employee is a
participant to be amended to provide that all Transferred Employees fully
vest in all benefits accrued under such Seller Benefit Plan as of the Closing
Date.   Section 5.12 Certain Shareholder Agreements. The Sellers shall take
all necessary action to cause the shareholder agreements described on Section
5.12 of the Seller Disclosure Schedule between certain Sellers and certain of
the Purchased Subsidiaries to be terminated, with such termination to be
effective as of the Closing.   Section 5.13 Transition Services Agreement.
Promptly after the execution of this Agreement, the parties shall negotiate
in good faith the terms and conditions of the Transition Services Agreement,
the term of which shall be for a reasonable period of time following the
Closing (not to exceed 180 days, or such other period as may be agreed upon
between Chemicals and Purchaser). The services available to the Purchaser
under the Transition Services Agreement shall be those services which are
mutually agreed upon prior to the Closing to effect an orderly transition of
the Business. The services under the Transition Services Agreement shall be
provided to Purchaser at the Sellers\' cost, including an appropriate
overhead allocation and setup costs. From and after the date of this
Agreement, the Sellers will cooperate with Purchaser to enable Purchaser to
understand the Sellers\' provision of the services to be provided under the
Transition Services Agreement to enable the Purchaser to make appropriate
arrangements for the provision of such services other than under
the Transition Services Agreement. The Holdings Group shall have no
liability whatsoever to Purchaser for any error, act or omission in
connection with the Services to be rendered by the Holdings Group to
Purchaser hereunder unless any such error, act or omission is attributable to
the Holdings Group\'s willful misconduct or gross negligence.   Section

parties hereto shall take all necessary actions and execute all necessary
documents in furtherance thereof.      66    Section 5.16 Cure of
Defaults. Subject to the prior approval of the Bankruptcy Court, the Seller
Parties shall, on or prior to the Closing, cure any and all defaults and
breaches under and satisfy (or, with respect to any Assumed Liability or
obligation that cannot be rendered non-contingent and liquidated prior to the
Closing Date, make effective provision satisfactory to the Purchaser and the
Bankruptcy Court for satisfaction from funds of the Sellers) any liability or
obligation arising from or relating to pre-Closing periods under the Assumed
Contracts and the Valdosta Lease so that such Assumed Contracts and the
Valdosta Lease may be assumed by the Sellers and assigned to the Purchaser in
accordance with the provisions of Section 365 of the Bankruptcy Code and this
Agreement. Each Seller agrees that it will promptly take such actions as are
reasonably necessary to obtain the Sale Order or another order of the
Bankruptcy Court, in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to
Purchaser and otherwise consistent with this Agreement, which shall provide
for the assumption of and assignment to the Purchaser of the Assumed
Contracts and the Valdosta Lease and the payment of all Cure Costs by the
Seller Parties.   Section 5.17 Certain Litigations. The Sellers shall use

Canadian Facilities and any Liabilities of the Purchased Subsidiaries
pursuant to the DIP Facility and (b) release the Purchased Assets (and the
Canadian Assets) of any and all Liens arising in connection therewith.

notice to Purchaser, and Purchaser shall give prompt notice to the Sellers,
of the occurrence, or non-occurrence, of any event the occurrence, or non-
occurrence, of which could reasonably be expected, individually or in
the aggregate (a) to cause any representation or warranty of such party
contained in this Agreement to be untrue or inaccurate in any material
respect if made as of any time at or prior to the Closing Date and (b) to
result in any material failure of such party to comply with or satisfy any
covenant, condition or agreement to be complied with or satisfied hereunder;
provided, however, that the delivery of any notice pursuant to this Section
5.19 shall not limit or otherwise affect the remedies available hereunder to
any of the parties sending or receiving such notice.   Section 5.20 No
Solicitation.   (a) From the date hereof until the termination hereof, and
except as expressly permitted by the following provisions of this Section
5.20, Chemicals will not, nor will it permit any of its Affiliates to, nor
will it authorize or permit any officer, director or employee of Chemicals or
any of its Affiliates or any investment banker,       67   attorney,

negotiations with, any Person that makes an unsolicited bona fide written
Acquisition Proposal (such Person, a "POTENTIAL ACQUIRER") if (A) Chemicals\'
Board of Directors, after consultation with its outside legal counsel,
determines in good faith that such action is legally required for Chemicals\'
Board of Directors to comply with its duties under the Bankruptcy Code or
their fiduciary duties under applicable Law, (B) Chemicals\' Board
of Directors determines in good faith that such Acquisition Proposal, based
upon such matters as it deems relevant including applicable legal, regulatory
and other relevant aspects of the Acquisition Proposal and after consultation
with its financial advisor, would, or would reasonably be expected to lead to
a transaction which would reasonably be expected to be consummated and,
if consummated, result in a transaction more favorable to Chemicals from
a financial point of view than the Acquisition, (C) as promptly as
reasonably practicable (and in any event no later than twenty four (24) hours
of receipt), Chemicals notifies Purchaser of (1) the receipt of such

made such Acquisition Proposal (x) for nonpublic information relating to any
Seller Party or any Purchased Asset (including the Canadian Assets) and / or
(y) for access to the properties, books or records of any Seller Party or
Purchased Subsidiary and (2) that Chemicals or any Seller Party intends to
engage in negotiations with, or to provide information to such Potential
Acquirer, (D) Chemicals receives from such Potential Acquirer an executed
confidentiality agreement that is no more favorable to such Person than the
Confidentiality Agreement, and (E) Chemicals furnishes or makes available to
Purchaser the same information provided to such Person (to the extent not
previously furnished or made available). Without limiting the foregoing, the
Seller Parties agree that any breach of the restrictions set forth in this
Section 5.20 by any Affiliate of Chemicals or any of their respective
Representatives shall be deemed to be a breach by Chemicals of this Section
5.20.   (b) Immediately after the execution and delivery of this Agreement,
Chemicals will, and will cause its Affiliates and Representatives to, cease
and terminate any existing activities, discussions or negotiations with any
parties conducted heretofore with respect to any possible Acquisition
Proposal.      68    ARTICLE VI   CONDITIONS   Section 6.1

results in the withholding of such Required Consent, and (ii) the party
seeking to terminate this        73   Agreement pursuant to this

and conditions set forth herein, are not approved by the Bankruptcy Court;
provided, however, that if the Sale Order is entered by the Bankruptcy Court

the Termination Fee shall not give the Purchaser a right to terminate this
Agreement pursuant to this Section 7.1(h); or   (i) by Purchaser, on or
prior to December 2, 2002, if the Audited Financial Statements shall, in the
reasonable judgment of Purchaser, present a material and adverse change in

shall have the meaning ascribed thereto in the Purchase Agreement (as defined
below).   WITNESSETH:   WHEREAS, the parties hereto are entering into this
Deposit Escrow Agreement pursuant to the Asset and Stock Purchase Agreement,
dated as of the date hereof (the "PURCHASE AGREEMENT"), among Chemicals,
Sterling Canada, Inc., a Delaware corporation, Sterling Pulp Chemicals US,
Inc., a Delaware corporation, Sterling Pulp Chemicals, Inc., a Georgia
corporation, Sterling Chemicals Acquisitions, Inc., a Delaware corporation,
and Purchaser, a copy of which has been provided to the Escrow Agent; and  
WHEREAS, this Deposit Escrow Agreement is designed to implement the
provisions of Section 2.3 of the Purchase Agreement pursuant to which the
Good Faith Deposit (in an amount equal to $US11,250,000.00 in immediately
available funds) is being deposited with the Escrow Agent to be distributed
to Chemicals or returned to Purchaser, in each case with any interest thereon
accruing and to be payable to Purchaser, as provided in the Purchase
Agreement;   NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the mutual
agreements herein contained, the parties hereto hereby agree as follows:  
1. APPOINTMENT OF ESCROW AGENT. Chemicals and Purchaser hereby appoint the
Escrow Agent to act as escrow agent hereunder and the Escrow Agent agrees to
act as such, pursuant to the terms hereinafter set forth herein.   2.
DEPOSIT OF ESCROW FUND. On the date hereof, in accordance with Section 2.3(b)
of the Purchase Agreement, Purchaser is delivering to the Escrow Agent by
wire transfer the Good Faith Deposit, in U.S. dollars (such sum, the "ESCROW
AMOUNT"), to an account specified by the Escrow Agent and the Escrow Agent is
accepting such sum for deposit in escrow pursuant to the provisions of this
Deposit Escrow Agreement. All interest in respect of the Escrow Amount shall
be invested and maintained by the Escrow Agent in the same manner as
the Escrow Amount (the "INTEREST AMOUNT") and be subject to the terms hereof.
The Interest Amount and the Escrow Amount are collectively referred to herein
as the "ESCROW FUND."   3. ESCROW ACCOUNT. Escrow Agent shall invest and
reinvest the Escrow Fund in the JPMorgan Chase Cash Escrow Product as shown
on Exhibit C hereto, unless otherwise instructed in writing by Chemicals and
Purchaser. Such written instructions, if any, referred to in the foregoing
sentence shall specify the type and      identity of the investments to
be purchased and/or sold and shall also include the name of the broker-
dealer, if any, which Chemicals and Purchaser direct the Escrow Agent to use
in respect of such investment, any particular settlement procedures required,
if any (which settlement procedures shall be consistent with industry
standards and practices), and such other information as Escrow Agent may
require. Escrow Agent shall not be liable for failure to invest or reinvest
funds absent sufficient written direction. Unless Escrow Agent is otherwise
directed in such written instructions, Escrow Agent may use a broker-dealer
of its own selection, including a broker-dealer owned by or affiliated with
Escrow Agent or any of its affiliates. The Escrow Agent or any of its
affiliates may receive compensation with respect to any investment directed
hereunder. It is expressly agreed and understood by the parties hereto that
Escrow Agent shall not in any way whatsoever be liable for losses on
any investments, including, but not limited to, losses from market risks due
to premature liquidation or resulting from other actions taken pursuant to
this Deposit Escrow Agreement.  Receipt, investment and reinvestment of the
Escrow Fund shall be confirmed by Escrow Agent as soon as practicable by
account statement, and any discrepancies in any such account statement shall
be noted by Chemicals or Purchaser to Escrow Agent within 30 calendar days
after receipt thereof. Failure to inform Escrow Agent in writing of any
discrepancies in any such account statement within said 30-day period shall
conclusively be deemed confirmation of such account statement in its
entirety. For purposes of this paragraph, (a) each account statement shall be
deemed to have been received by the party to whom directed on the earlier to
occur of (i) actual receipt thereof and (ii) five "Business
Days" (hereinafter defined) after the deposit thereof in the United States

Purchaser shall bear in full all federal, state and local taxes based upon or

can comply with reporting obligations imposed under any laws relating to such
taxes. Upon execution of this Escrow Agreement, Chemicals shall provide
Escrow Agent with its taxpayer identification number documented by an
appropriate Form W-9 and Purchaser shall provide Escrow Agent with a
Certificate of Foreign Status of Beneficial Owner for Untied States Tax
Withholding on Form W-8BEN.   5. RIGHTS TO ESCROW FUND. The Escrow Amount
shall be for the exclusive benefit of Purchaser and Chemicals and their
respective successors and permitted assigns, and no other Person shall have
any right, title or interest therein, except as otherwise contemplated herein
or by the Purchase Agreement. The Escrow Amount shall not be property of
Chemicals or Purchaser unless and until released to Chemicals or Purchaser,
as the case may be, in accordance with the Purchase Agreement and Section 6
below. The Interest Amount shall be for the exclusive benefit of
Purchaser     2   and its successors and assigns and shall be released
to the Purchaser periodically, at Purchaser\'s request.   6. CLAIMS,
PROCEDURES AND PAYMENT FROM ESCROW ACCOUNT. The Escrow Amount shall be held
and disposed of by the Escrow Agent for the benefit of Purchaser or
Chemicals, as the case may be, as follows:   (a) General.   (i) If the
transactions contemplated by the  Purchase Agreement are consummated, then
pursuant to Section 2.3  thereof, the Escrow Amount shall be credited to the
Purchase Price  thereunder and Chemicals shall deliver a letter (a "DIRECTION

Chemicals in writing pursuant to Section 2.3 of the Purchase Agreement)  an
amount, in immediately available funds, equal to the entire Escrow  Amount
and (B) to the Purchaser an amount, in immediately available  funds, equal to
the entire Interest Amount.   (ii) If (i) the Purchase Agreement is 
terminated by Sellers (x) pursuant to Section 7.1(e) of the Purchase 
Agreement or (y) pursuant to Section 7.1(b)(1) as of December 31, 2002,  (ii)
all of the conditions contained in Article VI of the Purchase  Agreement have

6.2(i) of the Purchase Agreement has not  been satisfied (as determined in
accordance with Section 1.2(q) of the  Purchase Agreement), and (iii) the
conditions set forth in Sections  6.1(a) and 6.1(b) of the Purchase Agreement
are satisfied as of the  date of such termination (except to the extent that
such conditions by  their nature can only be satisfied at Closing), then
Chemicals shall  deliver to the Escrow Agent (with a copy to Purchaser) a
Direction  Letter instructing the Escrow Agent to pay (A) to Chemicals, in 
accordance with Section 2.3(c) of the Purchase Agreement, an amount, in 
immediately available funds, equal to the entire Escrow Amount and (B)  to

Escrow  Agent to distribute the Escrow Amount and the Interest Amount in 
accordance with this Section 6(a) at a     4    specified time or times

(iii) may contain such other directions to  the Escrow Agent as may be
required by this Deposit Escrow Agreement,  reasonably requested by the
Escrow Agent or mutually agreeable in  writing to Chemicals and
Purchaser.   (b) Payment; Disputes.   (i) Subject to the following
provisions of  this Section 6(b) and the provisions of Section 9, Escrow
Agent shall,  within five (5) Business Days following the receipt by it of
a  Direction Letter, deliver as specified in such Direction Letter, an 
amount, in immediately available funds equal to all of the Escrow  Amount,
all of the Interest Amount or all of the Escrow Fund, as the  case may
be.   (ii) If the Purchaser or Chemicals, as the  case may be, shall, in
good faith, notify the Escrow Agent and  Chemicals in writing of any
objections or disputes with respect to the  instructions of the Direction
Letter within five (5) Business Days  following the Escrow Agent\'s receipt
of such Direction Letter pursuant  to Sections 6(a)(ii) or 6(a)(iii) hereof
(a "DISPUTED CLAIM"), then the  Escrow Agent shall instead set aside such
Direction Letter and not make  payment thereof until (a) the Purchaser and
Chemicals have agreed in  writing upon the terms of the Direction Letter and
shall have notified  the Escrow Agent of such an agreement in writing in a
joint Direction  Letter signed by both Chemicals and Purchaser, or (b) such
rights are  finally determined pursuant to the provisions of this Section
6(b) and  Section 9 of this Deposit Escrow Agreement as notified to the
Escrow  Agent (A) in writing by the Bankruptcy Court, (B) in a joint
Direction  Letter signed by both Chemicals and Purchaser or (C) in a
Direction  Letter signed by either Chemicals or Purchaser accompanied by a
copy of  a final order of the Bankruptcy Court.   (iii) Chemicals and
Purchaser shall use  commercially reasonable efforts to resolve promptly any
Disputed  Claims. If the parties are unable to resolve the Disputed Claim
within  five (5) Business Days after the date Purchaser or Chemicals, as
the  case may be, objects to the payment of the Disputed Claim, then such 
Disputed Claim shall be submitted to the exclusive jurisdiction of the 
Bankruptcy Court for resolution.   (iv) The Escrow Agent may conclusively
rely  on a final order of the Bankruptcy Court. The Bankruptcy Court shall 
have discretion to award expenses of such litigation or arbitration, 
including reasonable attorneys\' fees, to the prevailing party.   (v) During
the pendency of the Disputed  Claim, the Escrow Agent shall not make any
distributions of the Escrow  Amount, but may distribute the Interest Amount
to the Purchaser from  time to time at the request of the Purchaser.    
4    (vi) No later than two (2) Business Days  following the issuance of a
final order of the Bankruptcy Court  resolving the Disputed Claim, (a)
Chemicals and Purchaser shall deliver  a joint Direction Letter or (b) either
Chemicals or Purchaser shall  submit a Direction Letter accompanied by a copy
of such final order, in  either case, to the Escrow Agent requesting payment
of the Escrow  Amount in accordance with such final order, and the Escrow
Agent shall  (x) make payment out of the Escrow Amount in accordance with
such joint  Direction Letter or such Direction Letter accompanied by a copy
of such  final order, as the case may be and (y) pay the Interest Amount,
if  any, to the Purchaser.   (c) Other. In addition to the foregoing
procedure, the Escrow Agent may make payments from the Escrow Amount in
accordance with any final order of the Bankruptcy Court requiring the release
of all or a specified portion of the Escrow Amount at any time on and after
five (5) days following receipt by the Escrow Agent of a copy of such final
order from Chemicals, Purchaser or the Bankruptcy Court.   7. LIABILITY OF
ESCROW AGENT. The Escrow Agent shall not incur any liability to any party for
damages, losses or expenses for (a) any act or failure to act made or omitted
in good faith and without gross negligence or willful misconduct or (b) any
action taken or omitted in reliance upon any instrument that the Escrow Agent
shall in good faith believe to be genuine, nor will the Escrow Agent be
liable or responsible for forgeries, fraud, impersonations or determining the
scope of any representative authority. In addition, the Escrow Agent may
consult with legal counsel in connection with the Escrow Agent\'s duties
under this Deposit Escrow Agreement and shall be fully protected in any act
taken, suffered or permitted by it in good faith in accordance with the
advice of counsel. The Escrow Agent is not responsible for determining and
verifying the authority of any person acting or purporting to act on behalf

reimbursed, as the case may be, equally by Purchaser and Chemicals upon
presentation by the Escrow Agent of invoices or other documentation
evidencing the amounts of such expenses. In the event that the conditions of
this Deposit Escrow Agreement are not properly fulfilled, or if the Escrow
Agent renders any service not provided for in this Deposit Escrow Agreement,
or if the parties request a substantial modification of its terms, or if any
controversy arises, or if the Escrow Agent is made a party to, or intervenes
in, any litigation pertaining to this escrow or its subject matter, the
Escrow Agent shall be reasonably compensated for such extraordinary
service and reimbursed for all reasonable     5   costs, attorneys\'
fees and expenses of any firm occasioned by such default, delay, controversy
or litigation and the Escrow Agent shall have the right to retain all
documents and/or other things of value at any time held by the Escrow Agent
in this escrow until such compensation, fees, costs and expenses are paid.  
9. CONTROVERSIES. If any controversy arises relating to this Deposit Escrow
Agreement, or with any other party concerning the subject matter of this
Deposit Escrow Agreement, its terms or conditions, the Escrow Agent will not
be required to determine the controversy or to take any action regarding
it. Subject to Section 6 of this Deposit Escrow Agreement, if any such
controversy arises, the Escrow Agent may hold the Escrow Amount and may wait
until it is directed otherwise (i) by an order of the Bankruptcy Court, (ii)
in a joint Direction Letter from Chemicals and Purchaser or (iii) in a
Direction Letter signed by either Chemicals or Purchaser accompanied by a
copy of a final order of the Bankruptcy Court. In such event, the Escrow
Agent will not be liable for damages as long as the Escrow Agent acts in good
faith and without gross negligence or willful misconduct. The Escrow Agent is
authorized to deposit with the clerk of any court the Escrow Amount held
hereunder. Upon initiating an interpleader or declaratory judgment or any
other action seeking to determine the rights of the parties hereunder and

Section 6(a):   (a) In the event funds transfer instructions are given
(other than in writing at the time of execution of the Deposit
Escrow Agreement), whether in writing, by telefax, or otherwise, the Escrow
Agent is authorized to seek confirmation of such instructions by telephone
call-back to the person or person designated on Exhibit B hereto, and the
Escrow Agent may rely upon the confirmations of anyone purporting to be the
person or persons so designated. If the Escrow Agent is unable to contact any
of the authorized representatives identified in Exhibit B, the Escrow Agent
is hereby authorized to seek confirmation of such instructions by telephone
call-back to any one or more of Chemicals\' and Purchaser\'s executive
officers, ("Executive Officers"), which shall include the title of Chief
Financial Officer, as the Escrow Agent may select. Such "Executive Officer"

parties hereto to identify (i) the beneficiary, (ii) the beneficiary\'s bank,
or (iii) an intermediary bank. The Escrow Agent may apply any of the escrowed
funds for any payment order it executes using any such identifying number,

or an intermediary bank, designated.      10    IN WITNESS WHEREOF,

ESCROW PRODUCT   Financial transaction structures often require that the
trustee or escrow agent hold cash for various purposes, e.g. reserve or
collection accounts. Usually the escrow agent or trustee invests these funds
in AAA-rated money market funds or certain other investments having the
necessary liquidity, which are specified as permitted or eligible investments
in the governing documents, and which are specifically selected by the party
for whose benefit they are held.   JPMorgan offers a variation on these
investments: its own Cash Escrow Product. JPMorgan establishes a trust
account for each required account and agrees to pay a specified compensation
for its maintenance of the balance of funds involved. This permits instant,
seamless investment and liquidity without fees or expenses.  LIQUIDITY  
Funds are not held in a third party investment and are 100%
liquid.  SAFETY   The funds are maintained in a segregated trust account
on the corporate trust ledger, and as trust accounts they share the highest
priority in JPMorgan\'s assets (which exceed $715 billion). Also, there is no
operational risk of failed trades in respect of third-party
investments.  CONTROL  Trust accounts are under the direct supervision of
an administration officer assigned to the relationship. In addition, the
party benefiting from the account has the option to review the accounts
electronically.     C-1    EXHIBIT D   FORM OF ASSIGNMENT AND
