thereof had or may have had in respect of such Company Warrant.

 



-11- (e) _Company Options_. Each Company Option, whether vested or unvested, shall,
as of the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any further

applicable Tax Laws in accordance with _Section_ __ _ 2.8(e)_, in an amount
equal to the product of (i) the total number of shares of Company Common Stock
subject to such Company Option immediately prior to the Effective Time,
multiplied by (ii) the excess, if any, of (A) the Common Offer Price over (B)
the exercise price payable per share of Company Common Stock under such

cancelled and converted into the right to receive cash in an amount equal to
the Common Offer Price. Each holder of a Company Vested Restricted Stock
Award may tender such shares of Company Common Stock subject to such Company
Vested Restricted Stock Award pursuant to the Offer and any such shares of
Company Common Stock subject to such Company Vested Restricted Stock Award

virtue of the Merger and without any further action on the part of the holders
thereof, Parent, Acquisition Sub or the Company, be cancelled and converted
into the right to receive cash in an amount equal to the Common Offer Price.
In the event that a holder of a Company Unvested Restricted Stock Award that
is outstanding as of the Effective Time holds, in the aggregate, 2,000 or
more shares of Company Common Stock subject to Company Unvested Restricted
Stock Awards, then (x) 2,000 shares of Company Common Stock subject to such

Restricted Stock Award will be that number of Guarantor ADSs equal to the
product (rounded down to the nearest whole number) of (A) the number of shares
of Company Common Stock subject to the Converted Restricted Stock Award
immediately before the Effective Time and (B) the Exchange Ratio.

such holders become entitled under this _Article_ __ _ II_; and (ii) to the

Corporation, in obligations of or guaranteed by the United States of America
or obligations of an agency of the United States of America which are backed
by the full faith and credit of the United States of America (such cash amount

Preferred Stock (the "Uncertificated Shares"), in each case, whose shares
were converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration pursuant to
_Section_ __ _ 2.7_; and (B) of a Company Warrant converted into the right to
receive the Warrant Merger Consideration pursuant to  _Section_ __ _ 2.7_,

and/or (y) instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the Certificates
and Uncertificated Shares, as applicable, in exchange for the Merger
Consideration payable in respect thereof pursuant to the provisions of this 
_Article_ __ _ II_ (including instructions for providing to the Payment Agent
a properly executed IRS Form W-9 or appropriate IRS Form W-8).

 

(ii) Upon surrender of Certificates for cancellation to the Payment Agent or
to such other agent or agents as may be appointed by Parent, together with
such letter of transmittal, duly completed and validly executed in accordance

applicable withholding Taxes required to be withheld by applicable Tax Laws in
accordance with _Section_ __ _ 2.8(e)_) equal to the applicable
Merger Consideration for each share of Company Common Stock or Company Series
B Preferred Stock formerly represented by such Certificates that was converted
into the right to receive the Merger Consideration pursuant to  _Section_ __
_ 2.7_, and the Certificates so surrendered shall forthwith be canceled. Upon
receipt of an "agents message" by the Payment Agent (or such other evidence,
if any, of transfer as the Payment Agent may reasonably request) in the case
of a book-entry transfer of Uncertificated Shares, the holders of such
Uncertificated Shares shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor an
amount in cash (less any applicable withholding Taxes required to be withheld
by applicable Tax Laws in accordance with _Section_ __ _ 2.8(e)_) equal to
the applicable Merger Consideration for each share of Company Common Stock or
Company Series B Preferred Stock formerly represented by such holders
transferred Uncertificated Shares that was converted into the right to receive
the Merger Consideration pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 2.7_, and the transferred
Uncertificated Shares so surrendered shall forthwith be canceled.

(iii) Upon delivery of a letter of transmittal, duly completed and validly
executed in accordance with the instructions thereto, to the Payment Agent or
to such other agent or agents as may be appointed by Parent, the holders of
Company Warrants shall be entitled to receive in exchange for each Company
Warrant an amount in cash (less any applicable withholding Taxes payable in
respect thereof) equal to the Warrant Merger Consideration.

(iv) The Payment Agent shall accept such Certificates and transferred
Uncertificated Shares upon compliance with such reasonable terms and
conditions as the Payment Agent may impose to effect an orderly exchange
thereof in accordance with normal exchange practices. No interest shall be
paid or accrued for the benefit of holders of the Certificates and
Uncertificated Shares on the Merger Consideration payable upon the surrender
of such Certificates and Uncertificated Shares pursuant to this _Section_ __ _
2.8_.

 



-14- (v) Until so surrendered, (A) outstanding Certificates and Uncertificated
Shares shall be deemed from and after the Effective Time, to evidence only

(d) _Transfers of Ownership_. In the event that a transfer of ownership of
shares of Company Common Stock or Company Series B Preferred Stock or a
Company Warrant is not registered in the stock transfer books or ledger of the
Company, or if the Merger Consideration or Warrant Merger Consideration, as
applicable, is to be paid in a name other than that in which the
Certificates, Uncertificated Shares or Company Warrants, as applicable,
surrendered in exchange therefor are registered in the stock transfer books or
ledger of the Company, the Merger Consideration or Warrant Merger
Consideration, as applicable, may be paid to a Person other than the Person
in whose name the Certificate, Uncertificated Share or Company Warrant so
surrendered is registered in the stock transfer books or ledger of the Company
only if such Certificate, Uncertificated Share or Company Warrant is properly
endorsed and otherwise in proper form for surrender and transfer and the
Person requesting such payment has paid to Parent (or any agent designated by
Parent) any transfer Taxes required by reason of the payment of the
Merger Consideration or Warrant Merger Consideration, as applicable, to a
Person other than the registered holder of such Certificate, Uncertificated
Share or Company Warrant, as applicable, or established to the satisfaction of
Parent (or any agent designated by Parent) that such transfer Taxes have been
paid or are otherwise not payable.

(e) _Required Withholding_. Each of the Payment Agent, Parent and the
Surviving Corporation shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from any cash
amounts payable pursuant to this Agreement to any holder or former holder of
shares of Company Common Stock, Company Series B Preferred Stock, Company
Warrants, Company Options and Company Restricted Stock Awards such amounts as
are required to be deducted or withheld therefrom under applicable Tax Laws;
_provided_ , _however_ , if any withholding obligation may be avoided by
a payee providing information or documentation to the applicable payor, such
payor shall request such information from such payee and shall use
commercially reasonable efforts to avoid such withholding obligation. To the
extent that such amounts are so deducted, withheld and timely remitted to the
applicable Governmental Authority in accordance with applicable Tax Laws, such
amounts shall be treated for all purposes under this Agreement as having been
paid to the Person to whom such amounts would otherwise have been paid.

(f) _No Liability_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this
Agreement, none of the Payment Agent, Parent, the Surviving Corporation or
any other party hereto shall be liable to a holder of shares of Company Common
Stock or Company Series B Preferred Stock for any amount properly paid to a
public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or
similar Law. If any Certificates, Uncertificated Shares or Company Warrants
shall not have been exchanged prior to the date on which the related Merger
Consideration or Warrant Merger Consideration, as applicable, would escheat
to or become the property of any Governmental Authority, such Merger
Consideration shall, to the extent permitted by applicable Law, become the
property of the Surviving Corporation, free and clear of all claims or
interest of any Person previously entitled thereto.

(g) _Distribution of Exchange Fund to Parent_. Any portion of the Exchange
Fund that remains undistributed to the holders of the Certificates,
Uncertificated Shares or Company Warrants on the date that is twelve (12)
months after the Effective Time shall be delivered by the Payment Agent to
Parent upon demand, and any holders of shares of Company Common Stock or
Company Series B

 



-15-  Preferred Stock or Company Warrants that were issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the Merger who have not theretofore surrendered their
Certificates, Uncertificated Shares or Company Warrants, as applicable,
representing such shares of Company Common Stock, Company Series B Preferred
Stock or Company Warrants, as applicable, for exchange pursuant to the
provisions of this _Section_ __ _ 2.8_ shall thereafter look for payment of
the Merger Consideration or Warrant Merger Consideration, as applicable,
payable in respect of the shares of Company Common Stock, Company Series B
Preferred Stock or Company Warrants, as applicable, represented by
such Certificates, Uncertificated Shares or Company Warrants, as applicable,
solely to Parent (subject to abandoned property, escheat or other similar
laws), as general creditors thereof, for any claim to the applicable Merger
Consideration or Warrant Merger Consideration to which such holders may be
entitled pursuant to the provisions of this _Article_ __ _ II_.

2.9  _No Further Ownership Rights in Company_ _Common Stock, Company Series B
Preferred Stock or Company Warrants_. From and after the Effective Time, all
shares of Company Common Stock and Company Series B Preferred Stock and all
Company Warrants shall no longer be outstanding and shall automatically be
cancelled, retired and cease to exist, and each holder of a Certificate or
Uncertificated Share theretofore representing any shares of Company Capital
Stock, as applicable, or Company Warrant shall cease to have any rights with
respect thereto, except the right to receive the Merger Consideration or
Warrant Merger Consideration, as applicable, payable therefor upon the
surrender thereof in accordance with the provisions of _Section_ __ _ 2.8_.
The Merger Consideration or Warrant Merger Consideration, as applicable, paid
in accordance with the terms of this _Article_ __ _ II_ shall be deemed to
have been paid in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to such shares
of the Company Common Stock and Company Series B Preferred Stock and Company
Warrants, as applicable. From and after the Effective Time, there shall be no
further registration of transfers on the records of the Surviving Corporation
of shares of Company Common Stock or Company Series B Preferred Stock that
were issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time, other
than transfers to reflect, in accordance with customary
settlement procedures, trades effected prior to the Effective Time. If, after
the Effective Time, Certificates, Uncertificated Shares or Company Warrants
are presented to the Surviving Corporation for any reason, they shall be
canceled and exchanged as provided in this _Article_ __ _ II_.

2.10 _Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates_ __. In the event that
any Certificates shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, the Payment Agent
shall issue in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificates, upon
the making of an affidavit of that fact by the holder thereof, the Merger
Consideration payable in respect thereof pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 2.7_;
_provided_ that Parent may, in its reasonable discretion and as condition to
the payment of such Merger Consideration, require the owners of such lost,
stolen or destroyed Certificates to deliver a bond in such reasonable and
customary amount as it may reasonably direct as indemnity against any claim
that may be made against Parent, the Surviving Corporation or the Payment
Agent with respect to the Certificates alleged to have been lost, stolen or
destroyed.

2.11 _Necessary Further Actions_. If, at any time after the Effective Time,
any further action is necessary or desirable to carry out the purposes of
this Agreement and to vest the Surviving Corporation with full right, title
and possession to all Assets, property, rights, privileges, powers and
franchises of the Company and Acquisition Sub, the directors and officers of
the Surviving Corporation and Parent (in the name of Acquisition Sub) shall
take all such lawful and necessary action.

REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF THE COMPANY

 

Except (i) as disclosed in the letter delivered by the Company to Parent on
the date of this Agreement (the "Company Disclosure Letter"), or (ii) as
disclosed in any Company SEC Reports filed with or furnished to the SEC by the
Company and publicly available prior to the date of this Agreement (other than
disclosures contained or referenced therein under the captions "Risk Factors"
and any other disclosures contained or referenced therein of information,
factors or risks that are predictive, cautionary or forward-looking in
nature); provided, that in no event shall any disclosure in any Company SEC
Report qualify or limit the representations and warranties of the Company set

3.2_ (Corporate Power; Enforceability),  _Section_ __ _ 3.3_ (No Vote
Required), _Section_ __ _ 3.4_ (Non-Contravention), _Section_ __ _ 3.6_

organized, validly existing and in good standing under Delaware Law, and has
the requisite corporate power and authority to conduct its business as it is
presently being conducted and to own, lease or operate its properties and
Assets. The Company is duly qualified to do business and is in good standing
in each jurisdiction where the character of its properties owned or leased or
the nature of its activities make such qualification necessary (to the extent
the "good standing" concept is applicable in the case of any jurisdiction
outside the United States), except where the failure to be so qualified or in
good standing would not have a Company Material Adverse Effect. The Company
has made available to Parent a complete and accurate copy of the Companys
certification of incorporation and bylaws and the Certificate of Designation,
in each case as amended to the date of this Agreement. The Company is not in
violation of any provision of its certificate of incorporation, bylaws or the
Certificate of Designation.

 

3.2 _Corporate Power; Enforceability_. The Company has the requisite corporate
power and authority to execute and deliver this Agreement, to perform its
covenants and obligations hereunder and, assuming the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement are consummated in accordance with Section

execution and delivery by the Company of this Agreement, the performance by
the Company of its covenants and obligations hereunder and the consummation by
the Company of the transactions contemplated hereby have been duly authorized
by all necessary corporate action on the part of the Company, and no
additional corporate proceedings on the part of the Company are necessary to
authorize the execution and delivery by the Company of this Agreement, the
performance by the Company of its covenants and obligations hereunder or the
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby, assuming the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement are consummated in accordance with
Section 251(h) of the DGCL. This Agreement has been duly executed
and delivered by the Company and, assuming the due authorization, execution
and delivery by Parent and Acquisition Sub, constitutes a legal, valid and
binding obligation of the Company, enforceable against the Company in
accordance with its terms, except that such enforceability (a) may be limited
by applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium and other
similar Laws affecting or relating to creditors rights generally, and (b) is
subject to general principles of equity (the "Enforceability Limitations").

3.3 _No Vote Required_. The affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of
the outstanding shares of Company Capital Stock, voting together as a single-
class on an as-if converted to Company Common Stock basis is the only vote of
the holders of any class or series of Company Capital Stock that, absent
Section 251(h) of the DGCL, would have been necessary under applicable Law and
the Companys certificate of incorporation, bylaws and Certificate of
Designation to adopt this Agreement and consummate the Merger.

 



-17- 3.4 _Non-Contravention_. The execution and delivery by the Company of this
Agreement, the performance by the Company of its covenants and obligations
hereunder and the consummation by the Company of the transactions contemplated
hereby do not and will not (a) violate or conflict with any provision of the
certificate of incorporation or bylaws of the Company or the Certificate of
Designation, (b) subject to obtaining such Consents set forth in _Section_ __
_ 3.4_ of the Company Disclosure Letter, violate, conflict with, or result
in the breach of or constitute a default (or an event which with notice or
lapse of time or both would become a default) under, or result in the
termination of, or accelerate the performance required by, or result in
the loss of a benefit under, or result in a right of termination,
cancellation, amendment or acceleration under, or require any notice, consent,
waiver or payment of a penalty under, any Material Contract, (c) assuming the
Consents referred to in  _Section_ __ _ 3.5_ are obtained or made, violate
or conflict with any Law or Order applicable to the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries or by which any of their properties or Assets are bound, or (d)
result in the creation of any Lien (other than Permitted Liens) upon any of
the properties or Assets of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, except in
the case of each of clauses (b), (c) and (d) above, for such violations,
conflicts, defaults, terminations, accelerations or Liens which would not
have a Company Material Adverse Effect.

3.5 _Required Governmental Approvals_. No consent, approval, Order or
authorization of, filing or registration with, or notification to (any of the
foregoing being referred to herein as a "Consent"), any Governmental Authority
is required on the part of the Company or any Company Subsidiary in
connection with the execution and delivery by the Company of this Agreement,
the performance by the Company of its covenants and obligations hereunder and
the consummation by the Company of the transactions contemplated hereby,
except (a) the filing and recordation of the Certificate of Merger with the
Secretary of State of the State of Delaware and such filings with Governmental
Authorities to satisfy the applicable Laws of states in which the Company and
its Subsidiaries are qualified to do business, (b) such filings and approvals

required under, and compliance with any other applicable requirements of, the

contemplated by this Agreement, (v) approve, support, adopt or recommend any

or any of its Subsidiaries shall constitute a breach of this _Section_ __ _
5.2_ by the Company.

(c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this _Section_ __ _
5.2_ or elsewhere in this Agreement, if at any time on or after the date
hereof and prior to the Acceptance Time, any Person makes a _bona fide,_

breach of this _Section_ __ _ 5.2_ and that the Company Board determines in
good faith (after consultation with its financial advisor and outside legal
counsel) either constitutes or could reasonably be expected to lead to a
Superior Proposal, then the Company shall notify Parent in writing of such
determination promptly after the Company Board makes such determination (and
in any event within 24 hours after making such determination), and the
Company Board may, directly or indirectly through the Companys
Representatives, (i) participate or engage in discussions or negotiations with
such Person, (ii) furnish to such Person any non-public information relating
to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries and/or afford such Person access to
the business, properties, Assets, books, records or other non-public

in written form, in which case the Company shall give Parent a copy thereof)
and of the Companys intention to participate or engage in discussions or
negotiations with, or furnish non-public information to, such Person.

5.2_ or elsewhere in this Agreement, prior to the Acceptance Time, the

Person (other than Parent and Acquisition Sub) from, any "standstill" or
other similar agreement between the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, on the
one hand, and such Person, on the other, unless the Company Board determines
in good faith (after consultation with outside legal counsel) that the
failure to take such action would reasonably be expected to be inconsistent
with its fiduciary duties.

(e) In addition to the obligations of the Company set forth in _Section_ __ _
5.2(b)_, the Company shall promptly (and in any event within 24 hours) notify
Parent of the Companys or any of its Representatives receipt of (i) any

(i) has completed its review or investigation and determined it has unresolved
national security concerns and (ii) intends to send a report to the President
of the United States requesting the Presidents decision because it either
(A) recommends that the President act to suspend or prohibit the Merger, (B)
is unable to reach a decision on whether to recommend that the President
suspend or prohibit the Merger, or (C) requests that the President make a
determination with regard to the Merger (a "CFIUS Turndown"), Parent may
request a withdrawal of the notice filed with CFIUS in connection with the
CFIUS Clearance and neither Parent, Acquisition Sub nor the Company shall
have any further obligation to seek CFIUS Clearance.

 



-47- (c) Each of Parent and Acquisition Sub (and their respective Affiliates, if

promptly inform the other of any communication from any Governmental Authority
regarding any of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement in connection
with any filings or investigations with, by or before any Governmental
Authority relating to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby,
including any proceedings initiated by a private party. If any party hereto or
Affiliate thereof shall receive a request for additional information or
documentary material from any Governmental Authority with respect to the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement pursuant to the HSR Act or any
other applicable Laws with respect to which any such filings have been made,
then such party shall use its reasonable best efforts to make, or cause to be

period, a Second Request Notification indicating that Parent has elected not
to respond and comply with such Second Request shall be deemed delivered by
Parent and the Company may terminate this Agreement pursuant to _Section_ __ _
7.1(i)_. In connection with and without limiting the foregoing, to the

the applicable Governmental Authority, the parties hereto agree to (i) give

counsel for the other party with a reasonable advance opportunity to review

_Section_ __ _ 2.3(b)(i)_. Any such disclosures, rights to participate or
provisions of information by one party to the other may be made on an outside
counsel-only basis to the extent required under applicable Law or as
appropriate to protect confidential business information. Parent and
Acquisition Sub may redact or withhold any information or materials from the
other to the extent such information or materials are highly confidential.
The parties hereto shall take reasonable best efforts to share information
protected from disclosure under the attorney-client privilege, work product
doctrine, joint defense privilege or any other privilege pursuant to this
_Section_ __ _ 6.2_ in a manner so as to preserve the applicable privilege.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, it is understood and agreed that Parent shall,
on behalf of the parties and in consultation with the Company, control and
lead all communications and strategy relating to any investigation or other
inquiry that may

 



-48-  arise in connection with any Antitrust Laws matters addressed in this
_Section_ __ _ 6.2_, provided that, for the avoidance of doubt, the Company
shall not consent or agree to extend the waiting period under any Antitrust
Law or enter into any agreement with any Governmental Authority with respect
to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement without the prior written
consent of Parent.

 

(d) Each of Parent, Acquisition Sub and the Company shall cooperate with one
another to (i) promptly determine whether any filings not contemplated by
this _Section_ __ _ 6.2_ are required to be or should be made, and whether
any other consents, approvals, Permits or authorizations not contemplated by
this _Section_ __ _ 6.2_ are required to be or should be obtained, from any
Governmental Authority under any other applicable Law in connection with the
transactions contemplated hereby, and (ii) promptly make any filings, furnish
information required in connection therewith and seek to obtain timely any
such consents, Permits, authorizations, approvals or waivers that the parties
determine are required to be or should be made or obtained in connection with
the transactions contemplated hereby.

 

(e) For the avoidance of doubt, the obligations of Parent and Acquisition Sub
under this _Section_ __ _ 6.2_ shall not include any obligation on Parent or
Acquisition Sub to (i) hold separate, divest, lease, license, transfer,
dispose of or otherwise encumber, or cause a third party to purchase, any
assets, licenses, operations, rights, product lines and/or any business or
interest therein of Parent or the Company or any of their respective
Affiliates, or otherwise take or commit to take any action that limits
Parents or Acquisition Subs freedom of action with respect to, or its
ability to retain, the Company, or any material portion thereof, or any of
Parents other assets or business, or agree to any of the foregoing, (ii)
commence or participate in litigation in order to obtain any waivers, consents
or approvals of any Governmental Authority, lift any injunction, or otherwise
eliminate any legal bar to the consummation of the transactions contemplated
hereby or (iii) agree to any restrictions of any kind on, or modifications to,
any of Parents or its Affiliates business operations, as determined in
Parents sole reasonable discretion. The obligations of the Company under this
_Section_ __ _ 6.2_ shall not include any obligation on the Company to
commence or participate in litigation in order to obtain any waivers,
consents or approvals of any Governmental Authority, lift any injunction, or
otherwise eliminate any legal bar to the consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby.

 

6.3 _Company Board Recommendation_.

 

(a) Neither the Company Board nor any committee thereof shall (v) withhold,
withdraw, qualify, amend or modify in a manner adverse to Parent or
Acquisition Sub, or publicly propose to withhold, withdraw, qualify, amend or
modify in a manner adverse to Parent or Acquisition Sub, the Company Board
Recommendation, or fail to include the Company Board Recommendation in the
Schedule 14D-9, (w) approve, endorse or recommend, or publicly propose to

agreement, joint venture agreement, partnership agreement or other similar
agreement with respect to an Acquisition Proposal (other than an Acceptable
Confidentiality Agreement pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 5.2_) or (z) resolve to
take any action described in the foregoing clauses (v) through (y) (each of
clauses (v) through (z), a "Company Board Recommendation Change"); _provided_
, _however_ , that a "stop, look and listen" communication by the Company
Board to the Company Stockholders pursuant to Rule 14d-9(f) of the Exchange
Act, or any substantially similar communication, shall not be deemed to be a
Company Board Recommendation Change. Notwithstanding the foregoing or
anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement, at any time prior to the
Acceptance Time, the Company Board may effect a Company Board Recommendation
Change if the Company Board shall have determined in good faith
(after consultation with outside legal counsel) that the failure to effect a
Company Board Recommendation Change would reasonably be expected to be
inconsistent with its fiduciary duties, if and only if:

 



-49- (i) the Company shall have received a Superior Proposal that is first made
after the date hereof and did not result from a breach of _Section_ __ _
5.2_ or this _Section_ __ _ 6.3_, in which case the Company Board may effect
a Company Board Recommendation Change if and only if: (A) the Company
Board shall have determined in good faith (after consultation with outside
legal counsel) that the failure to enter into a definitive agreement relating
to such Superior Proposal would reasonably be expected to be inconsistent with
its fiduciary duties; (B) the Company shall have notified Parent in writing
of the Superior Proposal, including the material terms and conditions of, and
the identity of the Person making, such Superior Proposal and a copy of the
form of any related agreements (a "Superior Proposal Notice") (it being
agreed that the Superior Proposal Notice and any amendment or update to such
notice and the determination to so deliver such notice shall not constitute a
Company Board Recommendation Change for purposes of this Agreement); (C) if
requested by Parent, the Company shall have made its Representatives available
to discuss with Parents Representatives any proposed modifications to the
terms and conditions of this Agreement during the period beginning at 5:00
p.m. Central Time on the day of delivery by the Company to Parent of such
Superior Proposal Notice and ending at 5:00 p.m. Central Time on the fourth
(4th) Business Day following the day of such delivery so that the Acquisition
Proposal that is the subject of the foregoing notice is no longer a Superior
Proposal (it being understood and agreed that with respect to any amendment to
the financial terms or any other material amendment to any Acquisition
Proposal that is the subject of a previously delivered Superior Proposal
Notice, the Company shall have given Parent another notice based on such
Acquisition Proposal, as so amended (a "Proposal Amendment Notice"), and shall
have made its Representatives available to discuss with Parents
Representatives any proposed modifications to the terms and conditions of this
Agreement during the period beginning at 5:00 p.m. Central Time on the day of
delivery by the Company to Parent of such Proposal Amendment Notice and
ending at 5:00 p.m. Central Time on the third (3rd) Business Day following the
day of such delivery), and to the extent requested by Parent the Company shall
have negotiated, and shall have caused its Representatives to negotiate, with
Parent in good faith to make such adjustments to the terms and conditions of
this Agreement as would enable the Company Board to maintain the Company Board
Recommendation and not make a Company Board Recommendation Change; and (D) if
Parent shall have delivered to the Company during such four (4) Business Day
period (or three (3) Business Day period with respect to a Proposal Amendment
Notice, if applicable in accordance with clause (C) above) a written, binding
and irrevocable offer to modify the terms of this Agreement (which is set
forth in a definitive written amendment to this Agreement executed by Parent
and Acquisition Sub and delivered to the Company), the Company Board shall
have determined in good faith (after consultation with its financial advisor
and outside legal counsel), after considering the terms of such offer by
Parent, that the Superior Proposal giving rise to such Superior Proposal
Notice (or Proposal Amendment Notice) continues to be a Superior Proposal; or

(ii) there occurs an Intervening Event, in which case the Company Board may
effect a Company Board Recommendation Change if and only if: (A) the Company
Board shall have determined in good faith (after consultation with outside
legal counsel) that the failure to make a Company Board Recommendation Change
in light of such Intervening Event would reasonably be expected to be
inconsistent with its fiduciary duties; (B) the Company shall have notified
Parent in writing of such Intervening Event, including a reasonable
description of the facts underlying such Intervening Event (an "Intervening
Event Notice") (it being agreed that the Intervening Event Notice and any
amendment or update to such notice and the determination to so deliver such
notice, shall not constitute a Company Board Recommendation Change for
purposes of this Agreement); (C) if requested by Parent, the Company shall
have made its Representatives available to discuss with Parents
Representatives any proposed modifications to the terms and conditions of
this Agreement during the

 



-50-  period beginning at 5:00 p.m. Central Time on the day of delivery by the
Company to Parent of such Intervening Event Notice and ending at 5:00 p.m.
Central Time on the fourth (4th) Business Day following the day of such
delivery (it being understood and agreed that with respect to any material
change to the facts and circumstances relating to any Intervening Event that
is the subject of a previously delivered Intervening Event Notice,
the Company shall have given Parent another notice based on such Intervening
Event, and shall have made its Representatives available to discuss with
Parents Representatives any proposed modifications to the terms and
conditions of this Agreement during the period beginning at 5:00 p.m. Central
Time on the day of delivery by the Company to Parent of such new Intervening
Event Notice and ending at 5:00 p.m. Central Time on the third (3rd) Business
Day following the day of such delivery), and to the extent requested by
Parent, the Company shall have negotiated, and shall have caused its
Representatives to negotiate, with Parent in good faith to make such
adjustments to the terms and conditions of this Agreement as would enable
the company Board to maintain the Company Board Recommendation and not make a
Company Board Recommendation Change; and (D) if Parent shall have delivered to
the Company during such four (4) Business Day period (or three (3) Business
Day period with respect to a new Intervening Event Notice, if applicable in
accordance with clause (C) above) a written, binding and irrevocable offer to
modify the terms of this Agreement (which is set forth in a definitive written
amendment to this Agreement executed by Parent and Acquisition Sub and
delivered to the Company), the Company Board shall have determined in good
faith (after consultation with outside legal counsel), after considering the
terms of such offer by Parent, that the failure to make a Company Board
Recommendation Change in light of such Intervening Event would still
reasonably be expected to be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties.

 

(b) Nothing in this Agreement shall prohibit the Company Board from (i) taking
and disclosing to the Company Stockholders a position contemplated by Rule
14e-2(a) under the Exchange Act or complying with the provisions of Rule 14d-9
promulgated under the Exchange Act, and (ii) making any disclosure to the
Company Stockholders that the Company Board determines in good faith (after
consultation with its outside legal counsel) that the failure to make such
disclosure would reasonably be expected to be inconsistent with its
fiduciary duties; _provided_ that, in either such case, any such statement(s)
or disclosures made by the Company Board will be subject to the terms and
conditions of this Agreement, including the provisions of _Article_ __ _
VII_.

 

6.4 _Public Statements and Disclosure_. Neither the Company, on the one hand,
nor Parent and Acquisition Sub, on the other hand, shall issue any public
release or make any public announcement concerning this Agreement or the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement without the prior written consent
of the other (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned
or delayed), except as such release or announcement may be required by
applicable Law or the rules or regulations of any applicable United States
securities exchange or regulatory or Governmental Authority to which the
relevant party is subject or submits, wherever situated, in which case the
party required to make the release or announcement shall use its reasonable
best efforts to allow the other party or parties hereto reasonable time to
comment on such release or announcement in advance of such issuance (it being
understood that the final form and content of any such release or
announcement, as well as the timing of any such release or announcement, shall
be at the final discretion of the disclosing party); _provided_ , _ however_
, that the restrictions set forth in this _Section_ __ _ 6.4_ shall not apply
to any release or announcement made or proposed to be made by (a) the Company
pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 6.3(a)_ with respect to a Company Board
Recommendation Change or (b) Parent in connection with a response to the
issuance by the Company of any release or announcement of the type referred to
in clause (a). Parent and the Company agree that the press release announcing
the execution of this Agreement shall be a joint release of Parent and the
Company.

 



-51- 6.5 _Anti-Takeover Laws_. In the event that any state anti-takeover or other
similar Law is or becomes applicable to this Agreement, the Tender and
Support Agreements or any of the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby,
the Company, Parent and Acquisition Sub shall use their respective reasonable
best efforts to ensure that the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
may be consummated as promptly as practicable on the terms and subject to the
conditions set forth in this Agreement and otherwise to minimize the effect of
such Law on this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby.

6.6 _Access_. At all times during the period commencing with the execution and
delivery of this Agreement and continuing until the earlier to occur of the
termination of this Agreement in accordance with _Article_ __ _ VII_ and the
Effective Time, the Company shall afford Parent and its Representatives
reasonable access during normal business hours, upon reasonable notice, to
the properties, books and records and personnel of the Company and its
Subsidiaries, and shall furnish Parent with such financial, operating and
other data and information relating to the Company and its Subsidiaries as
Parent may reasonably request; _provided_ , _however_ , that the Company may
restrict or otherwise prohibit access to any documents or information to the
extent that the Company or its outside legal counsel reasonably determines
that (a) any applicable Law requires the Company to restrict or otherwise
prohibit access to such documents or information, or (b) access to such
documents or information would give rise to a material risk of waiving
any attorney-client privilege, work product doctrine or other applicable
privilege applicable to such documents or information; and _provided further_
, _however_ , that no information or knowledge obtained by Parent in any
investigation conducted pursuant to the access contemplated by this _Section_
__ _ 6.6_ shall affect or be deemed to modify any representation or warranty
of the Company set forth in this Agreement or otherwise impair the rights and
remedies available to Parent and Acquisition Sub hereunder. In the event that
the Company does not provide access or information in reliance on the
preceding sentence, it shall use its reasonable best efforts to communicate
the applicable information to Parent in a way that would not violate the
applicable Law or waive such a privilege. Any investigation conducted pursuant
to the access contemplated by this _Section_ __ _ 6.6_ shall be conducted in
a manner that does not unreasonably interfere with the conduct of the
business of the Company and its Subsidiaries or create a risk of damage or
destruction to any property or assets of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries. Any access to the properties of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries shall be subject to the terms and conditions of any applicable
Lease and the Companys reasonable security measures and insurance
requirements and shall not include the right to perform Phase 1 or Phase 2
environmental assessments or other invasive testing. The terms and conditions
of the Confidentiality Agreement shall apply to any information obtained by
Parent or any of its Representatives in connection with any investigation
conducted pursuant to the access contemplated by this _Section_ __ _ 6.6_.
Nothing in this _Section_ __ _ 6.6_ or elsewhere in this Agreement shall be
construed to require the Company, any of its Subsidiaries or any
Representatives of any of the foregoing to prepare any reports, analyses,
appraisals, opinions or other information.

6.7 _Section_ __ _ 16(b)_ _ Exemption_. The Company shall take all actions
reasonably necessary to cause the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
and any other dispositions of equity securities of the Company (including
derivative securities) in connection with the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement by each individual who is a director or officer of the Company
subject to the reporting requirements of Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act to
be exempt under Rule 16b-3 promulgated under the Exchange Act.

6.8 _Directors_ __ _and Officers_ __ _Indemnification and Insurance_.

(a) The Surviving Corporation shall (and Parent shall cause the
Surviving Corporation to) honor and fulfill in all respects the obligations
of the Company and its Subsidiaries under any and all (i) indemnification
agreements in effect as of the date hereof between the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries and any of their respective current or former directors and
officers and employees and any person who becomes a director or officer or
employee of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries prior to

 



-52-  the Effective Time (the "Indemnified Persons") set forth in _Section_ __ _

expense advancement and exculpation provisions in any certificate of
incorporate or bylaws or comparable organizational document of the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries in effect on the date of this Agreement. In addition,
during the period commencing at the Effective Time and ending on the sixth
(6th) anniversary of the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall (and
Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to) cause the certificates of
incorporation and bylaws (and other similar organizational documents) of the
Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries to contain provisions with respect
to indemnification, exculpation and the advancement of expenses that are at
least as favorable as the indemnification, exculpation and advancement of
expenses provisions contained in the certificates of incorporation and bylaws
(or other similar organizational documents) of the Company and its
Subsidiaries as of the date of this Agreement, and during such six-year
period, such provisions shall not be repealed, amended or otherwise modified
in any manner except as required by applicable Law.

 

(b) Without limiting the generality of the provisions of _Section_ __ _
6.8(a)_, during the period commencing at the Effective Time and ending on the
sixth (6th) anniversary of the Effective Time, to the fullest extent permitted
by applicable Law, the Surviving Corporation shall (and Parent shall cause the
Surviving Corporation to) indemnify and hold harmless each Indemnified Person
from and against any costs, fees and expenses (including reasonable attorneys
fees and investigation expenses), judgments, fines, losses, claims, damages,
liabilities and amounts paid in settlement in connection with any claim,
proceeding, investigation or inquiry, whether civil, criminal, administrative
or investigative, to the extent such claim, proceeding, investigation or
inquiry arises directly or indirectly out of, or pertains directly or
indirectly to (i) any action or omission or alleged action or omission in
such Indemnified Persons capacity as a director, officer, employee or agent
of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or other Affiliates (regardless of
whether such action or omission, or alleged action or omission, occurred
prior to, at or after the Effective Time), or (ii) any of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement; _provided_ , _however_ , that if, at any time
prior to the sixth (6th) anniversary of the Effective Time, any Indemnified
Person delivers to Parent a written notice asserting a claim for
indemnification under this _Section_ __ _ 6.8(b)_, then the claim asserted in
such notice shall survive the sixth (6th) anniversary of the Effective Time
until such time as such claim is fully and finally resolved. In addition,
during the period commencing at the Effective Time and ending on the sixth
(6th) anniversary of the Effective Time, to the fullest extent permitted by
applicable Law, the Surviving Corporation shall (and Parent shall cause the
Surviving Corporation to) advance, prior to the final disposition of any
claim, proceeding, investigation or inquiry for which indemnification may
be sought under this Agreement, promptly following request by an Indemnified
Person therefor, all costs, fees and expenses (including reasonable attorneys
fees and investigation expenses) incurred by such Indemnified Person in
connection with any such claim, proceeding, investigation or inquiry upon
receipt of an undertaking by such Indemnified Person to repay such advances if
it is ultimately decided in a final, non-appealable judgment by a court
of competent jurisdiction that such Indemnified Person is not entitled to
indemnification. In the event of any such claim, proceeding, investigation or
inquiry, (A) the Surviving Corporation shall have the right to control the
defense thereof after the Effective Time (it being understood that, by
electing to control the defense thereof, the Surviving Corporation will be
deemed to have waived any right to object to the Indemnified Persons
entitlement to indemnification hereunder with respect thereto), (B) each
Indemnified Person shall be entitled to retain his or her own legal counsel,
whether or not the Surviving Corporation shall elect to control the defense of
any such claim, proceeding, investigation or inquiry, (C) the Surviving
Corporation shall pay all reasonable fees and expenses of any legal counsel
retained by an Indemnified Person, promptly after statements therefor are
received, whether or not the Surviving Corporation shall elect to control the
defense of any such claim, proceeding, investigation or inquiry, and (D) no
Indemnified Person shall be liable for any settlement effected without his or
her prior express written consent. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
set forth in this _Section_ __ _ 6.8(b)_ or elsewhere in this Agreement,
neither the Surviving Corporation nor any of its Affiliates (including Parent)
shall settle or otherwise compromise or consent to the entry of any judgment
or otherwise seek termination with respect

 



-53-  to any claim, proceeding, investigation or inquiry for which indemnification
may be sought by an Indemnified Person under this Agreement unless such
settlement, compromise, consent or termination includes an unconditional
release of all Indemnified Persons from all liability arising out of such
claim, proceeding, investigation or inquiry.

 

(c) During the period commencing at the Effective Time and ending on the sixth
(6th) anniversary of the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall (and
Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to) maintain in effect directors
and officers liability insurance ("DandO Insurance") in respect of acts or
omissions occurring at or prior to the Effective Time, covering each Person
currently covered by the Companys directors and officers liability
insurance, on terms with respect to the coverage and amounts that are no less
favorable than those of such policy in effect on the date hereof; _provided_
, _however_ , that in satisfying its obligations under this _Section_ __ _
6.8(c)_, Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall not be obligated to pay
annual premiums in excess of two hundred and fifty percent (250%) of the
amount paid by the Company for coverage for its last full fiscal year prior to
the date hereof (such two hundred and fifty percent (250%) amount, the
"Maximum Annual Premium") (which premiums the Company represents and warrants
to be as set forth in _Section_ __ _ 6.8(c)_ of the Company Disclosure
Letter); _provided_ , _however_ , __ that, if the annual premiums of such
insurance coverage exceed such amount, the Surviving Corporation shall be
obligated to (and Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to) maintain a
policy that, in the Surviving Corporations good faith judgment, provides the
greatest coverage available for a cost not exceeding the Maximum Annual
Premium. Prior to the Effective Time, notwithstanding anything to the contrary
set forth in this Agreement, the Company may purchase a six-year "tail"
prepaid policy on the DandO Insurance; provided, however, that the amount paid
for such prepaid policy does not exceed the Maximum Annual Premium. In the
event that the Company elects to purchase such a "tail" policy prior to the
Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall (and Parent shall cause the
Surviving Corporation to) maintain such "tail" policy in full force and effect
and continue to honor their respective obligations thereunder, in lieu of all
other obligations of Parent and the Surviving Corporation under the first
sentence of this _Section_ __ _ 6.8(c)_ for so long as such "tail" policy
shall be maintained in full force and effect.

 

(d) If Parent or the Surviving Corporation or any of its successors or assigns
shall (i) consolidate with or merge into any other Person and shall not be
the continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation or
merger, or (ii) transfer all or substantially all of its properties and assets
to any Person, then, and in each such case, proper provisions shall be made
so that the successors and assigns of the Surviving Corporation shall assume
all of the obligations of Parent and the Surviving Corporation set forth in
this _Section_ __ _ 6.8_.

 

(e) The obligations set forth in this _Section_ __ _ 6.8_ shall not be
terminated, amended or otherwise modified in any manner that adversely
affects any Indemnified Person (or any other person who is a beneficiary under
the DandO Insurance or the "tail" policy referred to in _Section_ __ _ 6.8(c)_
(and their heirs and representatives)) without the prior written consent of
such affected Indemnified Person or other Person who is a beneficiary under
the DandO Insurance or the "tail" policy referred to in _Section_ __ _ 6.8(c)_
(and their heirs and representatives), unless required by applicable Law.
Each of the Indemnified Persons or other Persons who are beneficiaries under
the DandO Insurance or the "tail" policy referred to in _Section_ __ _ 6.8(c)_
(and their heirs and representatives) are intended to be third party
beneficiaries of this _Section_ __ _ 6.8_, with full rights of enforcement as
if a party thereto. The rights of the Indemnified Persons (and other Persons
who are beneficiaries under the DandO Insurance or the "tail" policy referred
to in _Section_ __ _ 6.8(c)_ (and their heirs and representatives)) under
this _Section_ __ _ 6.8_ shall be in addition to, and not in substitution
for, any other rights that such Persons may have under the certificates of
incorporation, bylaws or other equivalent organizational documents, any and
all indemnification agreements of or entered into by the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries, or applicable Law (whether at law or in equity).

 



-54- (f) The obligations and liability of Parent and the Surviving Corporation
under this  _Section_ __ _ 6.8_ shall be joint and several.

(g) Nothing in this Agreement is intended to, shall be construed to or shall
release, waive or impair any rights to directors and officers insurance
claims under any policy that is or has been in existence with respect to the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries for any of their respective directors,
officers or other employees, it being understood and agreed that the
indemnification provided for in this _Section_ __ _ 6.8_ is not prior to or
in substitution for any such claims under such policies.

 

6.9 _Employee Matters_.

(a) Unless Parent provides written notice to the Company that such 401(k)
plan(s) shall not be terminated no later than ten (10) Business Days prior to
the Acceptance Time, the Company Board or the board of directors of its
applicable Subsidiaries shall adopt resolutions terminating any and all
401(k) plans maintained by the Company or any such Subsidiary, in each case
effective as of the day immediately preceding the Closing Date (the "401(k)
Termination Date"). The Company shall provide Parent evidence that the 401(k)
plan(s) of the Company and its Subsidiaries have been terminated pursuant to
such resolutions. If the 401(k) plan(s) described in this section have been
terminated as of the 401(k) Termination Date, Parent shall permit Continuing
Employees to roll over their account balances (including loan notes) to a
401(k) plan of Parent or an Affiliate. From and after the Acceptance Time, the
Surviving Corporation shall (and Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation
to) honor all employment agreements, Employee Plans and compensation
arrangements in accordance with their terms as in effect immediately prior to
the Acceptance Time, _provided_ , _however_ , __ that nothing in this
sentence shall prohibit the Surviving Corporation or its Subsidiaries from
amending or terminating, or from causing the Surviving Corporation or its
Subsidiaries to amend or terminate, any such Employee Plans, arrangements or
agreements in accordance with their terms or if otherwise required by
applicable Law.

(b) For a period of at least one (1) year following the Effective
Time, Parent shall provide to, or cause to be provided to, each employee of
the Company and its Subsidiaries who is employed by Parent, the Surviving
Corporation or an Affiliate as of immediately prior to the Effective Time
(each, a "Continuing Employee") an annual base salary or an hourly wage rate,
as applicable, that is not less than that provided to such Continuing Employee
by the Company of its Subsidiaries immediately prior to the Effective Time.

 

(c) Parent, the Surviving Corporation and their respective Subsidiaries and
Affiliates shall treat, and shall cause each employee benefit plan, program,
arrangement, agreement, policy or commitment sponsored or maintained by
Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any of their respective Subsidiaries or
Affiliates following the Effective Time and in which any Continuing Employee
(or the spouse, domestic partner or any dependent of any Continuing Employee)
participates or is eligible to participate (each, a "Parent Benefit Plan") to
treat, for all purposes (including eligibility to participate, vesting and
level and accrual of benefits, other than accrual of benefits under any
"defined benefit plan," as defined in Section 3(35) of ERISA), all service
with the Company or any of its Subsidiaries (and predecessor employers to the
extent that the Company, its Subsidiary or any Employee Plan provides past
service credit) as service with Parent, the Surviving Corporation and their
respective Subsidiaries and Affiliates. Parent, the Surviving Corporation and
their respective Subsidiaries and Affiliates shall also cause each Parent
Benefit Plan that is a welfare benefit plan, within the meaning of Section
3(1) of ERISA, (i) to waive any and all eligibility waiting periods, actively-
at-work requirements, evidence of insurability requirements, pre-existing
condition limitations and other exclusions and limitations with respect to
the Continuing Employees and their spouses, domestic partners and dependents
to the extent waived, satisfied or not included under the corresponding
Employee Plan, and (ii) to recognize for each Continuing Employee for purposes
of applying annual deductible, co-payment and out-of-pocket

 



-55-  maximums under such Parent Benefit Plan any deductible, co-payment and out-
of-pocket expenses paid by the Continuing Employee and his or her spouse,
domestic partner and dependents under the corresponding Employee Plan during
the plan year of such Employee Plan in which occurs the later of the Closing
Date and the date on which the Continuing Employee begins participating in
such Parent Benefit Plan.

 

(d) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement, no
provision of this Agreement shall be deemed to (i) guarantee employment for
any period of time for, or preclude the ability of Parent, the Surviving
Corporation or their Subsidiaries to terminate, any Continuing Employee for
any reason, or (ii) subject to the limitations and requirements specifically
set forth in this _Section_ __ _ 6.9_, require Parent, the Surviving
Corporation or any of their Subsidiaries to continue any Employee Plan or
prevent the amendment, modification or termination thereof after the Effective
Time. No provision of this Agreement shall create any third party beneficiary
rights in any employee of the Company or any Company Subsidiary, any
beneficiary or dependents thereof, or any collective bargaining representative
thereof, with respect to the compensation, terms and conditions of employment
and benefits that may be provided to any employee of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries by Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any of their Affiliates
or under any benefit plan which any of them may maintain, or otherwise. No
provision of this Agreement shall operate as an amendment to any benefit plan
maintained by the Company or Parent or their respective Subsidiaries.

 

6.10 _Rule 14d-10 Matters_. The parties acknowledge that certain payments have
been made or are to be made and certain benefits have been granted or are to
be granted according to employment compensation, severance and other employee
benefit plans of the Company, including the Employee Plans (collectively, the
"Arrangements"), to certain Company Stockholders and holders of other Company
Securities (collectively, the "Covered Securityholders"). The Compensation
Committee of the Company Board (the "Company Compensation Committee") (A) at
a meeting to be held prior to the Acceptance Time, will duly adopt
resolutions approving as an "employment compensation, severance or other
employee benefit arrangement" within the meaning of Rule 14d-10(d)(1) under
the Exchange Act (an "Employment Compensation Arrangement") (1) each
Arrangement presented to the Company Compensation Committee on or prior to the
date of this Agreement, (2) the treatment of the Company Options and Company
Restricted Stock Awards, as applicable, in accordance with the terms set forth
in this Agreement, and (3) the terms of _Section_ __ _ 6.8_ and  _Section_
__ _ 6.9_, and (B) will take all other actions necessary to satisfy the
requirements of the non-exclusive safe harbor under Rule 14d-10(d)(2) under
the Exchange Act with respect to the foregoing arrangements. Each member of
the Company Compensation Committee is an "independent director" in accordance
with the requirements of Rule 14d-10(d)(2) under the Exchange Act.

6.11 _Obligations of Acquisition Sub_. Parent shall cause Acquisition Sub to
comply in all respects with each of the representations, warranties,
covenants, obligations, agreements and undertakings made or required to be
performed by Acquisition Sub in accordance with the terms of this Agreement,
the Offer, the Merger, and the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement. As a material inducement to the Companys willingness to enter into
this Agreement and perform its obligations hereunder, Parent hereby
unconditionally guarantees full performance and payment by Acquisition Sub of
each of the covenants, obligations and undertakings required to be performed
by Acquisition Sub under this Agreement and the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement, subject to all terms, conditions and limitations contained in
this Agreement, and hereby represents, acknowledges and agrees that any such
breach of any such representation and warranty or default in the performance
of any such covenant, obligation, agreement or undertaking of Acquisition Sub
shall also be deemed to be a breach or default of Parent, and the Company
shall have the right, exercisable in its sole discretion, to pursue any and
all available remedies it may have arising out of any such breach
or nonperformance directly against either or both of Parent and Acquisition
Sub in the first instance. The guarantee described in the preceding sentence
is a guarantee of payment and performance, and not of collection. As
applicable, references in this  _Section_ __ _ 6.11_ to "Acquisition Sub"
shall also include the Surviving Corporation following the Effective Time.

 



-56- 6.12 _Notification of Certain Matters_.

 

(a) At all times during the period commencing with the execution and delivery
of this Agreement and continuing until the earlier to occur of the
termination of this Agreement in accordance with _Article_ __ _ VII_ and the
Effective Time, the Company shall give prompt notice to Parent and Acquisition
Sub upon becoming aware (i) that any representation or warranty made by it in
this Agreement has become untrue or inaccurate in any material respect, or of
any failure of the Company to comply with or satisfy in any material respect
any covenant, condition or agreement to be complied with or satisfied by
it under this Agreement, in any such case if and only to the extent that such
untruth or inaccuracy, or such failure, would reasonably be expected to cause
any of the Offer Conditions set forth in _Sections (iii)(B) and (iii)(C)_ of
_Annex B_  to fail to be satisfied at the then scheduled expiration of the
Offer; _provided_ that no such notification in and of itself shall affect or
be deemed to modify any representation or warranty of the Company set forth in
this Agreement or the conditions to the obligations of Parent and Acquisition
Sub to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or the
remedies available to the parties hereunder, (ii) of any notice or other
communication received by the Company or any of its Affiliates from any
Governmental Authority in connection with the Offer, the Merger or the other

or the other transactions contemplated hereby, and (iii) any Legal Proceeding
commenced or threatened in writing against the Company, relating to or
involving the Offer, the Merger or the other transactions
contemplated hereby; _provided, however_ that the terms and conditions of the
Confidentiality Agreement shall apply to any information provided to Parent
pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 6.12(a)_.

Sub in this Agreement has become untrue or inaccurate in any material respect,
or of any failure of Parent or Acquisition Sub to comply with or satisfy in
any material respect any covenant, condition or agreement to be complied with
or satisfied by it under this Agreement, in any such case if and only to the
extent that such untruth or inaccuracy, or such failure, would reasonably be
expected to prevent or materially delay the consummation of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement (including the Offer and the Merger) or the
ability of Parent and Acquisition Sub to fully perform their respective
covenants and obligations under this Agreement; _provided_ , __ that no such
notification in and of itself shall affect or be deemed to modify any
representation or warranty of Parent or Acquisition Sub set forth in this
Agreement or the conditions to the obligations of the Company to consummate
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or the remedies available to
the parties hereunder, (ii) of any notice or other communication received by
Parent, Acquisition Sub or any of their respective Affiliates from any
Governmental Authority in connection with the Offer, the Merger or the
other transactions contemplated hereby or from any Person alleging that the
Consent of such Person is or may be required in connection with the Offer, the
Merger or the other transactions contemplated hereby, and (iii) any Legal
Proceeding commenced or threatened in writing against Parent or Acquisition
Sub, relating to or involving the Offer, the Merger or the other transactions
contemplated hereby; _provided, however_ that the terms and conditions of the
Confidentiality Agreement shall apply to any information provided to the
Company pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 6.12(b)_.

 



-57- 6.13 _Certain Litigation_. The Company shall promptly notify Parent in writing
of any litigation commenced after the date of this Agreement against the
Company or any of its directors (in their capacity as such) by any Company
Stockholders (on their own behalf or on behalf of the Company) relating to

reasonably informed regarding any such litigation. The Company shall give
Parent the opportunity to participate in (but not control) the defense or
settlement of any such stockholder litigation and shall consider Parents
views with respect to such stockholder litigation. The Company shall not
settle any such litigation without the prior written consent of Parent (which
shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed).

 

6.14 _Bridge Loan_. From and after the date of this Agreement, Parent and the
Company shall negotiate in good faith for the provision by Parent of loans to
the Company in an amount up to $500,000 per month, as may be reasonably
necessary to satisfy the Companys ongoing working capital requirements, such
loans to begin being made on the date that is ninety (90) days following the
date of this Agreement, except as prohibited by applicable Law, and otherwise
on commercially reasonable terms.

other party or parties hereto, as applicable, except (a) for the terms of this
_Section_ __ _ 7.2_, _Section_ __ _ 7.3_ and _Article_ __ _ VIII_, each of

_Section_ __ _ 7.1(b)_; (B) following the execution and delivery of this
Agreement and prior to the termination of this Agreement pursuant to

the termination of this Agreement pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 7.1(b)_, (1)
the Company enters into a definitive agreement in respect of any Acquisition
Proposal (which need not be the same Acquisition Proposal described in
clause (B) above) and the transactions contemplated by such Acquisition
Proposal are subsequently consummated or (2) the transactions contemplated by
any Acquisition Proposal (which need not be the same Acquisition Proposal
described in clause (B) above) are consummated.

(ii) In the event that this Agreement is terminated by the Company pursuant
to  _Section_ __ _ 7.1(e)_, the Company shall pay to Parent the Termination
Fee, by wire transfer of immediately available funds to an account or accounts
designated in writing by Parent, concurrently with the termination of
this Agreement as a condition to the effectiveness of such termination.

(iii) In the event that this Agreement is terminated by Parent pursuant to
_Section_ __ _ 7.1(f)_, the Company shall pay to Parent the Termination Fee,
by wire transfer of immediately available funds to an account or accounts
designated in writing by Parent, within two (2) Business Days after such
termination.

 



-60- (c) _Single Payment Only_. The parties hereto acknowledge and hereby agree
that in no event shall the Company be required to pay the Termination Fee on
more than one occasion, whether or not such termination fee may be payable
under more than one provision of this Agreement at the same or at different
times and the occurrence of different events.

(d) _Liquidated Damages_. Each of the Company, Parent and Acquisition Sub
acknowledges and agrees that (i) the agreements contained in this _Section_
__ _ 7.3_ are an integral part of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, (ii) the Termination Fee is not a penalty, but is liquidated
damages, in a reasonable amount that will compensate Parent in the
circumstances in which such fee is payable for the efforts and resources
expended and opportunities foregone while negotiating this Agreement and in
reliance on this Agreement and on the expectation of the consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby, which amount would otherwise be impossible
to calculate with precision, (iii) in the event that Parent shall receive the
Termination Fee, none of Parent, Acquisition Sub, any of their respective
Affiliates or any other Person shall be entitled to bring or maintain any
other claim, action or proceeding against the Company or any of its Affiliates
arising out of this Agreement, any of the transactions contemplated hereby or
any matters forming the basis of the termination of this Agreement triggering
the payment of such Termination Fee, provided that nothing in this _Section_
__ _ 7.3(d)_ shall relieve the Company from any liability or damages
resulting from any knowing and intentional breach of this Agreement prior to
such termination, in accordance with clause _(b)_ of _Section_ __ _ 7.2_,
and (iv) without these agreements, neither the Company nor Parent would have
entered into this Agreement; accordingly, if the Company fails to timely pay
any amount due pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 7.3_ and, in order to obtain
such payment, Parent commences a suit that results in a judgment against the
non-paying party for the payment of any amount set forth in this _Section_ __
_ 7.3_, the non-paying shall pay the other party its costs and expenses
in connection with such suit, together with interest on such amount at equal
to the prime rate as published in _The Wall Street Journal_ Eastern Edition,
in effect on the date such payment was required to be made, plus two percent
(2%), through the date such payment was actually received (calculated daily
on the basis of a year of 365 days and the actual number of days elapsed,
without compounding). The Termination Fee is non-refundable and shall not be
offset by or credited against any other payment.

7.4 _Amendment_. Subject to applicable Law and subject to the other provisions
of this Agreement, this Agreement may be amended by the parties hereto at any
time by execution of an instrument in writing signed on behalf of each of
Parent, Acquisition Sub and the Company; _provided_ , _however_ , that after
the Acceptance Time, no amendment shall be made to this Agreement that causes
the Merger Consideration to differ from the Common Offer Price or the
Preferred Offer Price, as applicable.

 

7.5 _Extension; Waiver_. At any time and from time to time prior to the
Effective Time, any party or parties hereto may, to the extent legally
allowed and except as otherwise set forth herein, (a) extend the time for the
performance of any of the obligations or other acts of the other party or
parties hereto, as applicable, (b) waive any inaccuracies in
the representations and warranties made to such party or parties hereto
contained herein or in any document delivered pursuant hereto and (c) waive
compliance with any of the agreements or conditions for the benefit of such
party or parties hereto contained herein. Any agreement on the part of a
party or parties hereto to any such extension or waiver shall be valid only if
set forth in an instrument in writing signed on behalf of such party or
parties, as applicable. Any delay in exercising any right under this
Agreement shall not constitute a waiver of such right, nor shall any single or
partial exercise of any such right, or any abandonment or discontinuance of
steps to enforce such right, or any course of conduct, preclude any other or
further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right.

8.5 _Assignment_. No party may assign either this Agreement or any of its
rights, interests, or obligations hereunder without the prior written consent
of the other parties, and any such assignment without such prior written
consent shall be null and void; provided that Parent or Acquisition Sub, upon
prior written notice to the Company, may assign, in its sole discretion, any
of or all its rights, interests and obligations under this Agreement to
Parent or to any direct or indirect wholly-owned Subsidiary of Parent,
provided such Subsidiary of Parent is a Delaware corporation and that such
assignment shall not impair, delay or prevent the consummation of the Merger
or otherwise materially impair the rights of the Company under this Agreement
or relieve Parent of any of its obligations under this Agreement. Subject to
the preceding sentence, this Agreement shall be binding upon and shall inure
to the benefit of the parties hereto and their respective successors and
permitted assigns.

 



-64- 8.6 _Confidentiality_. Parent, Acquisition Sub and the Company hereby
acknowledge that Parent and the Company have previously executed a Non-
Disclosure Agreement, made as of February 8, 2018 (as amended, the
"Confidentiality Agreement"), which will continue in full force and effect in
accordance with its terms.

8.7 _Entire Agreement_. This Agreement and the documents and instruments and
other agreements among the parties hereto as contemplated by or referred to
herein, including the Company Disclosure Letter, the Annexes hereto, the
Tender and Support Agreements and the Confidentiality Agreement, constitute
the entire agreement among the parties with respect to the subject matter
hereof and supersede all prior agreements and understandings, both written and
oral, among the parties with respect to the subject matter hereof; _provided_
, _however_ , the Confidentiality Agreement shall not be superseded, shall
survive any termination of this Agreement and shall continue in full force and
effect until the earlier to occur of (a) the Effective Time and (b) the date
on which the Confidentiality Agreement expires in accordance with its terms
or is validly terminated by the parties thereto.

8.8 _No Third Party Beneficiaries_. This Agreement is not intended to, and
shall not, expressly or impliedly, confer upon any Person (other than the
parties hereto) any rights or remedies hereunder, except (a) as set forth in
or contemplated by the terms and provisions of  _Section_ __ _ 6.8_, (b)
from and after the Acceptance Time, the rights of holders of shares of the
Company Capital Stock and other Company Securities to receive the
consideration pursuant to the Offer, as set forth in  _Article_ __ _ I_, (c)
from and after the Effective Time, the rights of holders of shares of the
Company Capital Stock and other Company Securities to receive the
consideration pursuant to the Merger, as set forth in  _Article_ __ _ II_,
and (d) this _Article_ __ _ VIII_ in respect of the Sections set forth under
the foregoing clauses (a) through (c); _provided, however_ , that only the
Company shall be entitled and have the right to pursue and recover damages in
the name of and on behalf of the Company Stockholders in the event of any
breach by Parent or Acquisition Sub of this Agreement prior to the Acceptance
Time.

 

8.9 _Severability_. In the event that any provision of this Agreement, or the
application thereof, becomes or is declared by a court of competent
jurisdiction to be illegal, void or unenforceable, the remainder of this
Agreement will continue in full force and effect and the application of such
provision to other persons or circumstances will be interpreted so as
reasonably to effect the intent of the parties hereto. The parties further
agree to replace such void or unenforceable provision of this Agreement with a
valid and enforceable provision that will achieve, to the extent possible, the
economic, business and other purposes of such void or unenforceable
provision.

8.10 _Remedies_.

 

(a) Subject to _Sections 7.3(b)_ through _(d)_ , and except as otherwise
provided herein, any and all remedies herein expressly conferred upon a party
will be deemed cumulative with and not exclusive of any other remedy conferred
hereby, or by Law or equity upon such party, and the exercise by a party of
any one remedy will not preclude the exercise of any other remedy.

 

(b) The parties hereto hereby agree that irreparable damage would occur in the
event that any provision of this Agreement were not performed in accordance
with its specific terms or were otherwise breached, and that money damages or
other legal remedies would not be an adequate remedy for any such damages.
Accordingly, the parties hereto acknowledge and hereby agree that in the event
of any breach or threatened breach by the Company, on the one hand, or Parent
or Acquisition Sub, on the other hand, of any of their respective covenants or
obligations set forth in this Agreement, the Company, on the one hand, and
Parent and Acquisition Sub, on the other hand, shall be entitled to an
injunction or injunctions to prevent or restrain breaches or threatened
breaches of this Agreement by the other (as applicable), and to specifically
enforce the terms and provisions of this Agreement to prevent breaches or

 



-65-  threatened breaches of, or to enforce compliance with, the covenants and
obligations of the other under this Agreement and to thereafter cause the
Merger and the transactions contemplated by this Agreement to be consummated.
The Company, on the one hand, and Parent and Acquisition Sub, on the other
hand hereby agree not to raise any objections to the availability of the
equitable remedy of specific performance to prevent or restrain breaches or
threatened breaches of this Agreement by such party (or parties), and to
specifically enforce the terms and provisions of this Agreement to prevent
breaches or threatened breaches of, or to enforce compliance with, the
covenants and obligations of such party (or parties) under this Agreement.
Any party seeking an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of this
Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions of this
Agreement shall not be required to provide any bond or other security in
connection with any such Order or injunction. The parties hereto further agree
that (x) by seeking the remedies provided for in this _Section_ __ _
8.10(b)_, a party shall not in any respect waive its right to seek any other
form of relief that may be available to a party under this Agreement
(including monetary damages) in the event that this Agreement has been
terminated or in the event that the remedies provided for in this  _Section_
__ _ 8.10(b)_ are not available or otherwise are not granted and (y) nothing
set forth in this _Section_ __ _ 8.10(b)_ shall require any party hereto to
institute any proceeding for (or limit any partys right to institute any
proceeding for) specific performance under this _Section_ __ _ 8.10(b)_ prior
or as a condition to exercising any termination right under _Article VII_ (and
pursuing damages after such termination), nor shall the commencement of any
Legal Proceeding pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 8.10(b)_ or anything set
forth in this _Section_ __ _ 8.10(b)_ restrict or limit any partys right to
terminate this Agreement in accordance with the terms of _Article VII_ or
pursue any other remedies under this Agreement that may be available then or
thereafter.

 

8.11 _Governing Law_. This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in
accordance with the Laws of the State of Delaware, regardless of the Laws
that might otherwise govern under applicable principles of conflicts of law
thereof.

8.12 _Consent to Jurisdiction_. Each of the parties hereto (a) irrevocably
consents to the service of the summons and complaint and any other process in
any action or proceeding relating to the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement for and on behalf of itself or any of its properties or assets, in
accordance with _Section_ __ _ 8.4_ or in such other manner as may be
permitted by applicable Law, and nothing in this _Section_ __ _ 8.12_ shall
affect the right of any party to serve legal process in any other manner
permitted by applicable Law; (b) irrevocably and unconditionally consents and
submits itself and its properties and assets in any action or proceeding to
the exclusive jurisdiction of the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware
(or, only if the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware declines to accept
or does not have jurisdiction over a particular matter, any federal or other
state court within the State of Delaware) in the event any dispute
or controversy arises out of this Agreement or the transactions contemplated
hereby, or for recognition and enforcement of any judgment in respect thereof;
(c) agrees that it will not attempt to deny or defeat such personal
jurisdiction by motion or other request for leave from any such court; (d)
agrees that any actions or proceedings arising in connection with this
Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby shall be brought, tried and
determined only in the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware (or, only
if the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware declines to accept or does
not have jurisdiction over a particular matter, any federal or other state
court within the State of Delaware); (e) waives any objection that it may now
or hereafter have to the venue of any such action or proceeding in any such
court or that such action or proceeding was brought in an inconvenient court
and agrees not to plead or claim the same; and (f) agrees that it will
not bring any action relating to this Agreement or the transactions
contemplated hereby or thereby in any court other than the aforesaid courts.
Each of Parent, Acquisition Sub and the Company agrees that a final judgment
in any action or proceeding in such courts as provided above shall be
conclusive and may be enforced in other jurisdictions by suit on the judgment
or in any other manner provided by applicable Law.

 



-66- 8.13 _WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL_. EACH OF PARENT, ACQUISITION SUB AND THE COMPANY
HEREBY IRREVOCABLY WAIVES ALL RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY ACTION,
PROCEEDING OR COUNTERCLAIM (WHETHER BASED ON CONTRACT, TORT OR OTHERWISE)
ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT OR THE ACTIONS OF PARENT,
ACQUISITION SUB OR THE COMPANY IN THE NEGOTIATION, ADMINISTRATION,
PERFORMANCE AND ENFORCEMENT HEREOF.

8.14 _Company Disclosure Letter Matters_.

 

(a) The information contained in this Agreement and in the Company Disclosure
Letter is disclosed solely for purposes of this Agreement, and no information
contained herein or therein will be deemed to be an admission by any party to
any third Person of any matter whatsoever, including (i) any violation of Law
or breach of Contract, or (ii) that such information is material or that such
information is required to be referred to or disclosed under this Agreement.

(b) The parties hereto agree that the disclosure set forth in any particular
section or subsection of the Company Disclosure Letter shall be deemed to be
an exception to (or, as applicable, a disclosure for purposes of) (i) the
representations and warranties (or covenants, as applicable) of the Company
that are set forth in the corresponding Section or subsection of this
Agreement, and (ii) any other representations and warranties (or covenants, as
applicable) of the Company that are set forth in this Agreement, but, in the
case of this clause (ii), only if the relevance of that disclosure as an
exception to (or a disclosure for purposes of) such other representations and
warranties (or covenants, as applicable) is reasonably apparent on the face of
such disclosure.

 

8.15 _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed in multiple counterparts,
all of which shall be considered one and the same agreement and shall become
effective when one or more counterparts have been signed by each of the
parties and delivered to the other party, including by email or facsimile, it
being understood that all parties need not sign the same counterpart.

 

8.16 _G_ _uarantee_.

 

(a) As a material inducement to the Companys willingness to enter into this
Agreement and perform its obligations hereunder, Guarantor hereby
unconditionally guarantees (the "Guarantee") full performance and payment by
Parent and Acquisition Sub of each of the covenants, obligations and
undertakings required to be performed by Parent or Acquisition Sub under
this Agreement and the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, subject
to all terms, conditions and limitations contained in this Agreement, and
hereby represents, acknowledges and agrees that any such breach of any such
representation and warranty or default in the performance of any such
covenant, obligation, agreement or undertaking of Parent or Acquisition Sub
shall also be deemed to be a breach or default of Guarantor, and the Company
shall have the right, exercisable in its sole discretion, to pursue any and
all available remedies it may have arising out of any such breach or
nonperformance directly against any or all of Guarantor, Parent and
Acquisition Sub in the first instance. The Guarantee is a guarantee of payment
and performance, and not of collection.

(b) Guarantor represents and warrants to the Company that (i) Guarantor is an
entity duly organized, validly existing and in good standing under the Laws
of the State of Israel, (ii) has all requisite corporate or similar power and
authority to execute and deliver this Agreement and to perform its obligations
hereunder, (iii) the execution and delivery of this Agreement and the
performance of the Guarantee by Guarantor have been duly authorized by all
necessary corporate or similar action on the part of Guarantor, and no
additional corporate or similar proceedings on the part of Guarantor are
necessary to authorize the execution and delivery of this Agreement or the
performance of the Guarantee by Guarantor

 



-67-  and (iv) the execution, delivery and performance by Guarantor of this
Agreement do not, and the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby
will not, violate, conflict with, or result in the breach of, any applicable
Law or agreement binding upon Guarantor, nor require Consent of any
Governmental Authority, except in each case as would not impact Guarantors
ability to perform or comply with its obligations hereunder in any material
respect. None of Guarantor, Parent or Acquisition Sub, nor any of their
Affiliates, nor any Representative of any of the foregoing, is making any
representation or warranty of any kind or nature whatsoever, written or oral,
express or implied, in connection with Guarantor or the Guarantee, except as
expressly set forth in this Section 8.16, and such Persons hereby expressly
disclaim any such other representations or warranties.

 

(c) The provisions of Section 7.3(a) and Article VIII will be deemed to be
applicable to this Section 8.16, and for the purposes of such provisions,
Guarantor shall be considered a "party."

provisions that require any counterparty thereto (and any of its
Representatives described therein) that receive material non-public
information of or with respect to the Company to keep such information
confidential; _provided_ that such confidentiality provisions are no less

Company Capital Stock (on an as-if converted to Company Common Stock
basis) outstanding after giving effect to the consummation of such purchase
or other acquisition, including pursuant to a tender offer or exchange offer
by any Person or "group" (as defined in or under Section 13(d) of the Exchange
Act) that, if consummated in accordance with its terms, would result in such
Person or "group" beneficially owning more than fifteen percent (15%) of the

Stock basis) outstanding after giving effect to the consummation of such
tender or exchange offer; (ii) any direct or indirect purchase or other

business combination, joint venture, recapitalization, reorganization or other
similar transaction involving the Company pursuant to which any Person or

representing more than fifteen percent (15%) of the shares of Company Capital

1914, the HSR Act, the Federal Trade Commission Act and all other Laws that
are designed or intended to prohibit, restrict or regulate actions having the
