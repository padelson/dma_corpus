customary for the conduct of the Target and its Subsidiaries&#146; business as currently conducted and,

losses and risks as are generally maintained by comparable businesses. All of the Insurance
Policies are in full force and effect and are valid, outstanding and enforceable, and all premiums
with respect thereto are currently paid and no basis exists for early termination of any of the
Insurance Policies on the part of the insurer thereunder, except where such failures to be in
effect would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Target
Material Adverse Effect. The coverage limits under the Insurance Policies have not been exhausted
or materially diminished. None of Target or its Subsidiaries have failed to give any notice or
present any claim under any such Insurance Policies in due and timely fashion, and there are no
outstanding unpaid claims under any such Insurance Policies. None of the Insurance Policies will
terminate or lapse (or be affected in any other materially adverse manner) by reason of any of the

reasonably be expected, individually or in the aggregate, to have a Target Material Adverse Effect.
No facts or circumstances exist which would relieve the insurer under any Insurance Policy of its
obligation to satisfy in full any valid claim of the Target or its Subsidiaries thereunder. Each
of Target and its Subsidiaries has complied with the material provisions of each Insurance Policy
under which it is the insured party, except where such failures to comply would not, individually

Target nor any of its Subsidiaries have received any notice of cancellation or non-renewal of any
Insurance Policy. Since January&nbsp;1, 2007, none of Target or its Subsidiaries have been refused any
insurance (including, without limitation, insurance against loss due to terrorist acts) with
respect to its assets, properties or businesses, nor has any coverage been limited by an insurance

Target or its Subsidiaries have carried insurance during the last three years. Since January&nbsp;1,
