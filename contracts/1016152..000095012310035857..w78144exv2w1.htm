ARTICLE I 

   

THE MERGER 

  

 SECTION 1.1 _The Merger_. On the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement, and in accordance with the Delaware General Corporation Law (" _DGCL_ "), Merger Sub shall be merged with and into Target at the Effective Time. At the Effective Time, the separate existence of Merger Sub shall cease and Target shall continue as the surviving company 

   ##### 

  

    

(the " _Surviving Company_ "). The Merger, the payment of the Merger
Consideration in connection with the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement are referred to herein as the "
_Transactions_." 

  

 SECTION 1.2 _Closing_. The closing of the Merger (the " _Closing_ ") shall take place at 10:00 a.m. (New York, New York time) on a date to be specified by the parties (the " _Closing Date_ "), which date shall be no later than the second Business Day after the satisfaction or waiver of the conditions set forth in Article VI (other than those conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied at the Closing, but subject to the satisfaction or waiver of those conditions at such time), at the offices of Akerman Senterfitt, One Southeast Third Avenue, Miami, Florida 33131, unless another time, date or place is agreed to in writing by the parties hereto. 

  

 SECTION 1.3 _Effective Time_. Subject to the provisions of this Agreement, as soon as practicable on the Closing Date the Surviving Company shall file with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware a certificate of merger, in substantially the form attached hereto as _Exhibit A_ , executed in accordance with the relevant provisions of the DGCL (the " _Certificate of Merger_ "). The Merger shall become effective upon the filing of the Certificate of Merger or at such later time as is agreed to by the parties hereto and specified in the Certificate of Merger (the time at which the Merger becomes effective is herein referred to as the " _Effective Time_ "). 

  

 SECTION 1.4 _Effects of the Merger_. The Merger shall have the effects set forth in the DGCL. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, and subject thereto, at the Effective Time, all the properties, rights, privileges, powers and franchises of Target and Merger Sub shall vest in the Surviving Company, and all debts, liabilities and duties of Target and Merger Sub shall become the debts, liabilities and duties of the Surviving Company.

 (b) The officers of Merger Sub immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be the officers of the Surviving Company until the earlier of their resignation or removal or until their respective successors are duly elected and qualified, as the case may be. 

    ##### 

  

     

ARTICLE II 

   

CONVERSION OF SECURITIES 

  

 SECTION 2.1 _Conversion of Securities_. At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of the holders of any securities of Merger Sub, Target or any other Person: 

  

 (a) _Equity of Merger Sub_. Each issued and outstanding share of common stock of Merger Sub shall be converted into and become one validly issued, fully paid and non-assessable share of common stock, par value $.001 per share, of the Surviving Company. 

   

 (b) _Cancellation of Treasury Shares and Parent-Owned Shares_. Any shares of Target Common Stock that are owned by Target as treasury stock and any shares of Target Common Stock owned by Parent or Merger Sub (collectively, " _Target Excluded Shares_ ") shall be automatically canceled and shall cease to exist and no consideration shall be delivered in exchange therefor. 

   

 (c) _Conversion of Common Stock_. Each share of Target Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (which, for purposes of this Section 2.1 and Section 2.2 (other than Section 2.2(d)), shall include shares of Target Common Stock that a person has elected prior to the Effective Time to purchase or receive pursuant to any Target Option or ESPP Right, but excluding shares to be canceled in accordance with Section 2.1(b)) shall be converted into the right to receive the following consideration (subject to adjustment in accordance with Section 2.1(h) and together with any cash in lieu of fractional shares of Parent Common Stock to be paid pursuant to Section 2.1(g) the " _Merger Consideration_ "): 

   

 (i) Each share of Target Common Stock with respect to which an election to receive stock consideration is properly made and not revoked pursuant to Section 2.1(d) (each, a " _Stock Election Share_ ") and each share of Target Common Stock as to which no election is made in accordance with Section 2(d) (each, a " _Non-Election Share_ ") shall be converted into the right to receive 1.30 (the " _Stock Election Exchange Ratio_ ") validly issued, fully paid and non-assessable shares of Parent Common Stock (the " _Per Share Stock Election Consideration_ "). 

  

 (ii) Subject to paragraphs (iii) and (iv) below, each share of Target Common Stock with respect to which an election to receive cash is properly made and not revoked pursuant to Section 2.1(d) (each, a " _Cash Election Share_ ") shall be converted into the right to receive an amount of cash (such amount, the " _Per Share Cash Election Consideration_ ") equal to the greater of (x) the "fair market value" (as defined below) of one validly issued, fully paid and non-assessable share of Parent Common Stock plus $6.00 or (y) the fair market value of 1.30 validly issued, fully paid and non-assessable shares of Parent Common Stock. 

  

 (iii) Notwithstanding the foregoing, no more than 20% of the shares of Target Common Stock are permitted to be Cash Election Shares. In the event elections are made to treat more than 20% of the shares of Target Common Stock outstanding immediately before the Effective Time as Cash Election Shares, the excess over 20% shall be treated for all purposes 

   ##### 

  

    

hereunder as Stock Election Shares (and not as Cash Election Shares) which
shall receive the Per Share Stock Election Consideration, such that only 20%
of the shares of Target Common Stock outstanding immediately before the
Effective Time are exchanged for the Per Share Cash Election Consideration. In
such event, a pro rata portion (rounded up to the nearest whole share) of
each holders shares of Target Common Stock with respect to which an election
was made to treat such shares as Cash Election Shares shall instead be
treated as Stock Election Shares such that the reduction in Cash
Election Shares is borne pro rata by each holder of Target Common Stock with
respect to which such election was made. 

  

 (iv) If paragraph (ii) above, after application of paragraph (iii) above, would otherwise result in more than $100,000,000 of cash being paid to holders of Cash Election Shares, then Parent may elect, in its sole and absolute discretion, to reduce the amount of cash paid to each holder of Cash Election Shares pro rata based on the number of Cash Election Shares held so that the total cash paid with respect to all Cash Election Shares is $100,000,000. If the Per Share Cash Election Consideration otherwise payable to any holder is reduced under this paragraph (iv), such holder shall be entitled to receive validly issued, fully paid and non-assessable shares of Parent Common Stock at a fair market value (defined below) equal to the amount of the reduction. 

  

 (v) For purposes of this Section 2.1(c), the "fair market value" of Parent Common Stock shall mean the average of the daily closing prices per share of Parent Common Stock for the ten consecutive trading days on which shares of Parent Common Stock are actually traded (as reported on the New York Stock Exchange) ending on the last trading day immediately preceding tenth business day preceding the Closing Date. 

  

 (d) _Election Procedures_. 

   

 (i) Not less than thirty (30) days prior to the anticipated Effective Time, an election form and other appropriate and customary transmittal materials (which shall specify that delivery of issued and outstanding Target Common Stock shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the certificates theretofore representing any such Target Common Stock (each, a " _Certificate_ ") or non-certificated shares represented by book entry (" _Book Entry Shares_ ") shall pass, only upon proper delivery of such Certificates or Book Entry Shares, respectively, to the Exchange Agent) in such form as Parent shall specify and as shall be reasonably acceptable to Target (the " _Election Form_ ") shall be mailed at such time as Target and Parent may agree (the " _Mailing Date_ ") to each holder of record of shares of Target Common Stock (including to holders of Target Options and ESPP Rights electing prior to the Effective Time to purchase or receive Target Common Stock), determined as of five (5) business days prior to the Mailing Date (the " _Election Form Record Date_"). 

  

 (ii) Each Election Form shall permit the holder (or the beneficial owner through appropriate and customary documentation and instructions), other than any holder of Target Excluded Shares, to specify (i) the number of shares of such holders Target Common Stock (including shares issuable pursuant to any Target Option or ESPP Right) with respect to which such holder elects to receive the Per Share Cash Election Consideration, (ii) the number of shares of such holders Target Common Stock with respect to which such holder elects to receive 

   ##### 

  

    

the Per Share Stock Election Consideration, or (iii) that such holder makes
no election with respect to such holders Target Common Stock. Any Target
Common Stock with respect to which the Exchange Agent has not received
an effective, properly completed Election Form on or before 5:00 p.m., New
York time, on the twentieth (20th) day following the Mailing Date (or such
other time and date as Target and Parent shall agree) (the " _Election
Deadline_ ") shall also be deemed to be Non-Election Shares. 

  

 (iii) Parent shall make available one or more Election Forms as may reasonably be requested from time to time by any persons who become holders (or beneficial owners) of Target Common Stock, between the Election Form Record Date and the close of business on the business day prior to the Election Deadline, and Target shall provide to the Exchange Agent all information reasonably necessary for it to perform as specified herein. 

  

 (iv) Any election shall have been properly made only if the Exchange Agent shall have received a properly completed Election Form by the Election Deadline. An Election Form shall be deemed properly completed only (i) if, in the case of issued and outstanding shares of Target Common Stock, accompanied by one or more Certificates (or customary affidavits), if applicable, and/or (ii) upon receipt of an "agents message" by the Exchange Agent or such other evidence of transfer of Book Entry Shares to the Exchange Agent as the Exchange Agent may reasonably request, collectively representing all shares of Target Common Stock covered by such Election Form, together with duly executed transmittal materials included in the Election Form. Any Election Form may be revoked or changed by the person submitting such Election Form, by written notice received by the Exchange Agent prior to the Election Deadline. In the event an Election Form is revoked prior to the Election Deadline, the shares of Target Common Stock represented by such Election Form shall become Non-Election Shares and, in the case of issued and outstanding shares of Target Common Stock, Parent shall cause the Certificates representing such shares of Target Common Stock or Book-Entry Shares to be promptly returned without charge to the person submitting the Election Form upon written request to that effect from the holder who submitted the Election Form, except to the extent (if any) a subsequent election is properly made with respect to any or all of such shares of Target Common Stock. Subject to the terms of this Agreement and of the Election Form, the Exchange Agent, in consultation with Parent and Target, shall have reasonable discretion to determine whether any election, revocation or change has been properly or timely made and to disregard immaterial defects in the Election Forms, and any good faith decisions of the Exchange Agent regarding such matters shall be binding and conclusive. None of Parent, Target or the Exchange Agent shall be under any obligation to notify any person of any defect in an Election Form. 

  

 (e) [reserved] 

   

 (f) _Effect of Conversion_. From and after the Effective Time, all of the Target Common Stock converted into the Merger Consideration pursuant to this Section 2.1, to the extent previously outstanding, shall no longer be outstanding and shall automatically be canceled and shall cease to exist, and each holder of a Certificate shall thereafter cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except the right to receive the Merger Consideration with respect thereto, in accordance with the applicable provisions of Section 2.2. 

    ##### 

  

     

 (g) _Fractional Shares_. No fraction of a share of Parent Common Stock will be issued by virtue of the Merger, but in lieu thereof each former holder of shares of Target Common Stock (including holders of ESPP Rights purchasing or receiving Target Common Stock) who would otherwise be entitled to a fraction of a share of Parent Common Stock (after aggregating all fractional shares of Parent Common Stock that otherwise would be received by such holder) shall, upon surrender of such holders Certificate(s) or Book Entry Shares, if applicable, receive from Parent an amount of cash in dollars (rounded to the nearest whole cent), without interest, less the amount of any withholding taxes with respect to such fractional shares as contemplated by Section 2.2(h), which are required to be withheld with respect thereto, equal to the product of (i) such fraction, multiplied by (ii) the closing sale price of one share of Parent Common Stock as quoted on the NYSE for the trading day that is one trading day prior to the Closing Date. 

   

 (h) _Stock Splits, Stock Dividends, Etc_. The Per Share Stock Election Consideration and the Per Share Cash Election Consideration shall be appropriately adjusted to reflect fully the effect of any stock split, reverse stock split, stock dividend (including any dividend or distribution of securities convertible into Parent Common Stock or Target Common Stock), reorganization, recapitalization, reclassification or other like change with respect to Parent Common Stock or Target Common Stock occurring on or after the date hereof and prior to the Effective Time. 

   

 SECTION 2.2 _Exchange of Shares_. 

  

 (a) _Exchange Fund_. Prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall appoint a commercial bank or trust company or such other party as is reasonably satisfactory to Target to act as exchange agent hereunder for the purpose of exchanging Certificates and Book Entry Shares for the Merger Consideration (the " _Exchange Agent_ "). Concurrently with the Effective Time, Parent shall deposit with the Exchange Agent, in trust for the benefit of holders of shares of Target Common Stock, the number of shares of Parent Common Stock that are issuable pursuant to Section 2.1 and an amount of cash representing the aggregate cash consideration payable pursuant to Section 2.1. Parent shall deposit such shares of Parent Common Stock with the Exchange Agent by delivering to the Exchange Agent certificates representing, or providing to the Exchange Agent an uncertificated book-entry for, such shares. In addition, Parent shall deposit with the Exchange Agent cash sufficient to make payments for the cash consideration pursuant to Section 2.1, payments in lieu of fractional shares pursuant to Section 2.1 and any dividends and other distributions pursuant to Section 2.2(c). Any cash and shares of Parent Common Stock deposited by Parent with the Exchange Agent shall hereinafter be referred to as the " _Exchange Fund._ " 

   

 (b) Promptly after the Effective Time, but in any event within ten (10) Business Days after the Effective Time, Parent shall cause the Exchange Agent to mail to each holder of record of one or more shares of Target Common Stock (and to any holder of Target Options and ESPP Rights electing prior to the Effective Time to purchase or receive Target Common Stock) as of the Effective Time (other than any holder which has previously and properly surrendered all of its Certificate(s) to the Exchange Agent in accordance with Section 2.1(d) (each, an " _Electing Stockholder_ ")): (i) a letter of transmittal (the " _Letter of Transmittal_ "), which shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to any the shares of 

    ##### 

  

    

Target Common Stock (that are issued and outstanding) shall pass, only upon
delivery of the corresponding Certificates (or customary affidavits) to the
Exchange Agent or receipt by the Exchange Agent of an "agents message" with
respect to Book Entry Shares, which letter shall be in customary form and have
such other provisions as Parent may reasonably specify, and (ii) instructions
for effecting the surrender of such Certificates or Book Entry Shares in
exchange for the Merger Consideration. Each holder of shares of Target Common
Stock (including any holder of Target Common Stock acquired pursuant to the
exercise of any Target Options or pursuant to ESPP Rights prior to the
Effective Time) that have been converted into a right to receive the Merger
Consideration, upon (i) with respect to any Electing Stockholder, completion
of the calculations required by Section 2.1(c) or (ii) with respect to any
holder that is not an Electing Stockholder, surrender of a Certificate
or Book Entry Shares to the Exchange Agent together with such Letter of
Transmittal, duly executed and completed in accordance with the instructions
thereto, and such other documents as may reasonably be required by the
Exchange Agent, will be entitled to receive in exchange therefor (i) one or
more shares of Parent Common Stock which shall be in uncertificated book-
entry form unless a physical certificate is requested and which shall
represent, in the aggregate, the whole number of shares that such holder has
the right to receive pursuant to Section 2.1(c) (after taking into account
all shares of Target Common Stock (including shares issuable pursuant to the
exercise prior to the Effective Time of any Target Option and ESPP Right then
held by such holder) and (ii) a check in the amount equal to any cash that
such holder has the right to receive pursuant to this Article II, consisting
of the cash consideration pursuant to Section 2.1(c), cash in lieu of any
fractional shares of Parent Common Stock to Section 2.1(g) and any dividends
and other distributions pursuant to Section 2.2(c). No interest will be paid
or will accrue on any cash payable pursuant to Section 2.1(c), Section 2.1(g)
or Section 2.2(c). 

   

 (c) _Distributions With Respect to Unexchanged Shares_. Whenever a dividend or other distribution is declared or made after the date hereof with respect to Parent Common Stock with a record date after the Effective Time, such declaration shall include a dividend or other distribution in respect of all shares of Parent Common Stock issuable pursuant to this Agreement. No dividends or other distributions declared or made after the date hereof with respect to shares of Parent Common Stock with a record date after the Effective Time will be paid to the holders of any unsurrendered Certificates or Book Entry Shares with respect to the Parent Common Stock represented thereby until the holders of record of such Certificates or such Book Entry Shares shall surrender such Certificates or such Book Entry Shares. Subject to applicable Laws, following surrender of any such Certificates or such Book Entry Shares, the Exchange Agent shall deliver to the record holders thereof, without interest, promptly after such surrender, the number of whole shares of Parent Common Stock issued in exchange therefore, cash payment if any issued in exchange therefor, cash payment in lieu of fractional shares to which such holder is entitled pursuant to Section 2.1(g), along with any such dividends or other distributions with a record date after the Effective Time and theretofore paid with respect to such whole shares of Parent Common Stock. 

   

 (d) _Transfer Books; No Further Ownership Rights in Target Common Stock_. The Merger Consideration paid in respect of Target Common Stock upon the surrender for exchange of Certificates in accordance with the terms of this Article II shall be deemed to have been paid in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to the Target Common Stock previously represented by such Certificates, including any rights to receive declared but unpaid dividends 

    ##### 

  

    

with a record date prior to the Effective Time, and at the Effective Time,
the share transfer books of Target shall be closed and thereafter there shall
be no further registration of transfers on the share transfer books of the
Surviving Company of Target Common Stock that were outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective Time. From and after the Effective Time, all shares of
Target Common Stock shall no longer be outstanding and shall automatically be
cancelled, retired and cease to exist, and the holders of Certificates that
evidenced ownership of Target Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to
the Effective Time shall cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except
as otherwise provided for herein or by applicable Law. 

   

 (e) _Transfers of Ownership_. In the event that a transfer of ownership of shares of Target Common Stock is not registered in the stock transfer books or ledger of Target, or if shares of Parent Common Stock are to be issued in a name other than that in which the Certificates surrendered in exchange therefor are registered, it will be a condition of the issuance thereof that the Certificates so surrendered are properly endorsed and otherwise in proper form for surrender and transfer and the Person requesting such payment has paid any transfer or other Taxes required by reason of the issuance of Parent Common Stock in any name other than that of the registered holder of the Certificates surrendered, or established to the reasonable satisfaction of Parent or the Surviving Company that such transfer or other Taxes have been paid or are otherwise not payable. 

   

 (f) _Termination of Exchange Fund_. Any portion of the Exchange Fund that remains undistributed to the holders of Target Common Stock for six (6) months after the Effective Time shall be delivered to Parent (or its designee), upon demand, and any holder of Target Common Stock who has not theretofore complied with this Article II shall thereafter look only to Parent or the Surviving Company for delivery or payment of the Merger Consideration and any dividends or other distributions payable in respect thereof pursuant to Section 2.2(c). 

   

 (g) _No Liability_. None of Parent, Merger Sub, Surviving Company or the Exchange Agent shall be liable to any Person in respect of any Merger Consideration from the Exchange Fund delivered to a public official to the extent required by any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar Law. If any Certificate has not been surrendered immediately prior to the date on which the Merger Consideration in respect of such Certificate would otherwise irrevocably escheat to or become the property of any Governmental Authority, any such Merger Consideration in respect of such Certificate shall, to the extent permitted by applicable Law, become the property of Parent, free and clear of all claims or interest of any Person previously entitled thereto. 

   

 (h) _Withholding Rights_. Parent, Surviving Company and the Exchange Agent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the consideration otherwise payable to any holder of Target Common Stock (including any holder of options or rights issued pursuant to the Target ESPP pursuant to which such holder may acquire Target Common Stock), pursuant to this Agreement such amounts as are required to be deducted and withheld with respect to the making of such payment under the Code, and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder, or under any other provision of applicable federal, state, local or foreign tax Law. To the extent that amounts are so withheld and paid over to the appropriate taxing authority by Parent, Surviving Company or the Exchange Agent, as applicable, such withheld amounts shall be treated for all 

    ##### 

  

    

purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to such holders in respect of
which such deduction and withholding was made by Parent, Surviving Company or
the Exchange Agent. 

   

 (i) _Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates_. In the event that any Certificates shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, the Exchange Agent shall issue in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificates, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the holder thereof, the cash, if any, and shares of Parent Common Stock issuable in respect thereof pursuant to Section 2.1(c), the cash in lieu of fractional shares payable in respect thereof pursuant to Section 2.1(g) and any dividends or distributions payable in respect thereof pursuant to Section 2.2(c); provided, however, that Parent may, in its discretion and as a condition precedent to the issuance thereof, require the owners of such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificates to deliver a bond in such reasonable sum as it may reasonably direct as indemnity against any claim that may be made against Parent, the Surviving Company or the Exchange Agent with respect to the Certificates alleged to have been lost, stolen or destroyed. 

   

 (j) _Further Action_. If, at any time after the Effective Time, any further action is necessary or desirable to carry out the purposes or intent of this Agreement and to vest the Surviving Corporation with full right, title and possession to all assets, property, rights, privileges, powers and franchises of Target and Merger Sub, the directors and officers of Target and Merger Sub shall have the authority to take all such lawful and necessary action. 

   

 SECTION 2.3 _Target Options, Restricted Stock and Employee Stock Purchase Plan_. 

  

 (a) As of the Effective Time, without any action on the part of the holders thereof, each option to purchase shares of Target Common Stock (a " _Target Option_ ") granted under any stock option or other equity incentive plan of Target (collectively, the " _Target Equity Plans_ ") which is outstanding and unexercised immediately following the Effective Time and which does not, by its terms, terminate on the Effective Time, whether vested or unvested shall cease to represent a right to purchase shares of Target Common Stock and shall be assumed by Parent. Each Target Option so assumed by Parent under this Agreement will continue to have, and be subject to, the same terms and conditions set forth in the applicable Target Option (including any applicable stock option agreement or other document evidencing such Target Option) immediately prior to the Effective Time (including any repurchase rights or vesting provisions), except that such Target Options will be exercisable (or will become exercisable in accordance with its terms) for that number of whole shares of Parent Common Stock equal to the product of the number of shares of Target Common Stock that were issuable upon exercise of such Target Option immediately prior to the Effective Time multiplied by the Stock Election Exchange Ratio, rounded down to the nearest whole number of shares of Parent Common Stock. The per share exercise price for the shares of Parent Common Stock issuable upon exercise of such assumed Target Option will be equal to the quotient determined by dividing the exercise price per share of Target Common Stock at which such Target Option was exercisable immediately prior to the Effective Time by the Stock Election Exchange Ratio, rounded up to the nearest whole cent; provided, that the exercise price and the number of shares of Parent Common Stock subject to such adjusted Target Option shall be determined in a manner consistent with the requirements of Section 409A of the Code. Each assumed Target Option shall be vested immediately following the Effective Time as to the same percentage of the total number of shares subject thereto as it was vested as to immediately prior to the Effective Time, except to 

    ##### 

  

    

the extent such Target Option by its terms in effect prior to the date
hereof provides for acceleration of vesting. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary in this Agreement, any Target Stock Option that must be exercised
prior to the Effective Time by its own terms or by the terms of the
applicable Target Equity Plan but which is not so exercised shall immediately
be terminated and cease to exist as of the Effective Time and any holder
thereof shall have no further rights in respect thereof. The conversion of
Target Options provided for in this Section 2.3(a), with respect to any
options which are intended to be "incentive stock options" (as defined
in Section 422 of the Code), shall be effected in a manner consistent with
Section 424(a) of the Code. 

   

 (b) Each share of Target Common Stock that is subject to transfer and/or forfeiture restrictions immediately prior to the Effective Time (collectively, the " _Target Restricted Stock_ ") shall, upon its conversion into the Merger Consideration pursuant to Section 2.1(c) hereof, except to the extent such Restricted Stock becomes fully vested pursuant to the terms of any Target Equity Plan, continue to be subject to the same restrictions. Upon such vesting or the lapsing of such restrictions, Parent shall be entitled to withhold such amounts as may be required to be withheld under the Code and any applicable state or local tax law with respect to such vesting or lapsing of restrictions. 

   

 (c) Target shall use its reasonable best efforts to take all actions necessary to provide that the following shall occur, at or immediately prior to the Effective Time (the " _Target ESPP-Related Events_ "): (i) each then outstanding option or right (" _ESPP Right_ ") to acquire Target Common Stock under Targets Employee Stock Purchase Plan (the " _Target ESPP_ ") shall automatically be exercised or deemed exercised, and (ii) in lieu of the shares of Target Common Stock otherwise issuable upon the exercise of each such option or right, the holder of such option or right shall have the right to elect to receive from Parent, following the Effective Time, either (A) the number of shares of Parent Common Stock or (B) cash, equal to the product of (x) the number of shares of Target Common Stock otherwise issuable upon such exercise or deemed exercise, and (y) either, as applicable (i) the Stock Election Exchange Ratio, or (ii) the Cash Election Exchange Ratio, except to the extent the holder of such option or right shall elect not to exercise the holders options and to withdraw the entire balance of the holders Target ESPP account prior to the Effective Time pursuant to the terms of the Target ESPP. Target shall use its reasonable best efforts to effectuate the Target ESPP-Related Events. Target shall use its reasonable best efforts to effectuate the Target ESPP-Related Events. Target (i) shall not permit the commencement of any new offering period under the Target ESPP following the date hereof, (ii) shall not permit any optionee or right holder to increase his or her rate of contributions under the Target ESPP following the date hereof, and (iii) shall terminate the Target ESPP as of the Effective Time. The Exchange Agent will administer the foregoing payments of the Parent Common Stock and cash from the Exchange Fund to the applicable Target ESPP participants on, or as soon as practicable following, the Effective Time. Such payments shall be made pursuant to instructions provided by Target and Parent. 

   

 (d) At the Effective Time, each Target Option, each Target Restricted Share, and each option or right issued by Target under the Target ESPP, shall cease to represent, or represent the right to purchase or acquire, any Target Common Stock, Target Preferred Stock or any other equity securities of the Target, Merger Sub, the Surviving Company or any of their 

    ##### 

  

    

respective assets due to its conversion into Parent Common Stock or Merger
Consideration, as applicable, pursuant to this Section 2.3.

execution and delivery of this Agreement by Target and the consummation by
Target of the Merger and the other Transactions to be performed or
consummated by Target, other than such other consents, approvals, filings,

    ##### 

  

     

 (c) Since January 1, 2007, the Target and its Subsidiaries have timely filed all regulatory reports, schedules, forms and registrations and other documents required to be filed with any Governmental Authority other than the SEC, including state securities administrators. As of their respective filing dates, all such reports, schedules, forms and registrations and other documents complied in all material respects with the requirements of applicable Law with respect to such items, and there is no unresolved violation or exception with respect to any such item alleged by any Governmental Authority, except for such unresolved violations or exceptions as would not reasonably be expected, individually or in the aggregate, to have a Target Material Adverse Effect. 

   

 (d) Neither Target nor any of its Subsidiaries has any liabilities of any nature (whether accrued, absolute, contingent or otherwise) which, if known, would be required to be reflected or reserved against on a consolidated balance sheet of Target prepared in accordance with GAAP, except liabilities (i) reflected or reserved against on the balance sheet of the Target and its Subsidiaries as of December 31, 2009 (the " _Target Balance Sheet Date_ ") (including the notes thereto) included in the Target SEC Documents, (ii) incurred after the Target Balance Sheet Date in the ordinary course of business consistent with past practice (as to both type and amount), (iii) as expressly contemplated by this Agreement or otherwise in connection with the Merger or (iv) as would not reasonably be expected, individually or in the aggregate, to have a Target Material Adverse Effect.

proper authorities to the extent due and payable, (vii) no written claim has
been made by any taxing authority in a jurisdiction where Target or any of
its Subsidiaries does not file tax returns that Target or any of
its Subsidiaries is or may be subject to taxation by that jurisdiction,
(viii) neither Target nor any of its Subsidiaries has made any payments, is
obligated to make any payments, or will become obligated under any contract

 (a) Each Employee Benefit Plan maintained, contributed to or required to be contributed to, or sponsored by, Target or any of its Subsidiaries or with respect to which Target or any of its Subsidiaries has any present or future liability (each, a " _Target Benefit Plan_ ") has 

   ##### 

  

 

been administered in all material respects in accordance with its terms.
Target, its Subsidiaries and all Target Benefit Plans are all in compliance

would reasonably be expected to adversely affect the qualification of such
Target Pension Plan. All contributions and premiums under or in connection
with Target Benefit Plans that are required to have been made as of the date

or otherwise except as may be required pursuant to any other applicable
law.

All Material Contracts to which Target or any of its Subsidiaries is a party,

Parent and each of its Subsidiaries hold all Permits necessary for the lawful conduct of their respective businesses, except where such failures to hold the same would not reasonably be expected, individually or in the aggregate, to have a Parent Material Adverse Effect. All Permits held by Parent and its Subsidiaries are valid and in full force and effect, no legal or administrative 

   ##### 

  

 

proceeding, claim, suit, action or investigation is pending or, to the
Knowledge of Parent, threatened, to suspend, cancel or revoke any such
Permit, and Parent and its Subsidiaries are in compliance with the terms of
all such Permits, except for such instances of non-compliance as would not
reasonably be expected, individually or in the aggregate, to have a Parent
Material Adverse Effect. The consummation of the Transactions will not result
in the violation of any Permit, except for such violations which would not
reasonably be expected, individually or in the aggregate, to have a Parent
Material Adverse Effect. 

   

 SECTION 4.10 _Tax Matters_. 

  

 Except as set forth on Schedule 4.10: (i) each of Parent and its Subsidiaries has timely filed, or has caused to be filed on its behalf (taking into account any extension of time within which to file), all Tax Returns required to be timely filed by it, and all such filed Tax Returns are correct and complete in all material respects, (ii) all Taxes (whether or not shown to be due on such Tax Returns) have been timely paid, (iii) no deficiency with respect to Taxes has been proposed, asserted or assessed against Parent or any of its Subsidiaries, which have not been fully paid or adequately reserved, (iv) no audit or other administrative or court proceedings are pending with any Governmental Authority with respect to Taxes of Parent or any of its Subsidiaries as to which written notice thereof has been received, (v) there is no currently effective agreement or other document extending, or having the effect of extending, the period of assessment or collection of any Taxes of Parent or its Subsidiaries nor has any request been made for any such extension, (vi) all Taxes that Parent or any of its Subsidiaries is (or was) required by Law to withhold or collect in connection with amounts paid or owing to any employee, independent contractor, creditor, stockholder or other third party have been duly withheld or collected, and have been timely paid over to the proper authorities to the extent due and payable, (vii) no written claim has been made by any taxing authority in a jurisdiction where Parent or any of its Subsidiaries does not file tax returns that Parent or any of its Subsidiaries is or may be subject to taxation by that jurisdiction, (viii) neither Parent nor any of its Subsidiaries has made any payments, is obligated to make any payments, or will become obligated under any contract entered into on or before the Closing Date to make any payments to employees, officers, independent contractors, or directors of Parent or any of its Subsidiaries, nor will any benefits accrue or rights vest with respect to such individuals, in each case that are contingent on (A) the Transactions or (B) a termination of such individuals employment or other service relationship with the Target or any of its Subsidiaries, in connection with the Transactions and (ix) none of Parent or any of its Subsidiaries has constituted either a "distributing corporation" or a "controlled corporation" as such terms are defined in Section 355 of the Code in a distribution of stock outside of the affiliated group of which Parent is the common parent qualifying or intended to qualify for tax-free treatment (in whole or in part) under Section 355(a) or 361 of the Code. 

  

 SECTION 4.11 _Employee Benefits_. 

  

 (a) Each Employee Benefit Plan maintained, contributed to or required to be contributed to, or sponsored by, Parent or any of its Subsidiaries or with respect to which Parent or any of its Subsidiaries has any present or future liability (each, a " _Parent Benefit Plan_ ") has been administered in all material respects in accordance with its terms. Parent, its Subsidiaries and all Parent Benefit Plans are all in compliance with the applicable provisions of ERISA, the Code and all other applicable Laws, except for any instances of noncompliance that would not 

   ##### 

  

 

reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Parent
Material Adverse Effect. All Parent Benefit Plans that are " _employee
pension plans_ " (as defined in Section 3(3) of ERISA) that are intended to
be tax qualified under Section 401(a) of the Code (each, a " _Parent Pension
Plan_ ") that is maintained, contributed to or required to be contributed
to by Parent or any of its Subsidiaries has received a favorable
determination or opinion letter from the IRS regarding such qualification and
to the Knowledge of Parent, no event has occurred since the date of the most
recent determination or opinion letter or application therefor relating to
any such Parent Pension Plan that would reasonably be expected to adversely
affect the qualification of such Parent Pension Plan. All contributions and
premiums under or in connection with Parent Benefit Plans that are required

set forth on Schedule 4.11(a), neither Parent nor any of its Subsidiaries has
incurred any current or projected liability in respect of post-employment or
post-retirement health, medical or life insurance benefits for current or
former employees of Parent or any of its Subsidiaries, except as required to
avoid an excise tax under Section 4980B of the Code or otherwise except as
may be required pursuant to any other applicable law. 

   

 (b) No Parent Benefit Plan exists that, as a result of the execution of this Agreement, stockholder approval of this Agreement, or the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (whether alone or in connection with any subsequent event(s)), will entitle any employee, consultant or director to (i) severance pay or any increase in severance pay upon any termination of employment after the date of this Agreement or (ii) accelerate the time of payment or vesting or result in any payment or funding (through a grantor trust or otherwise) of compensation or benefits under, increase the amount payable, or result in any other material obligation pursuant to, any of the Parent Benefit Plans. 

  

 SECTION 4.12 _Labor and Employment Matters_. 

  

 (a) Except as set forth on Schedule 4.12(a), and except as otherwise would not reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Parent Material Adverse Effect, Parent and each of its Subsidiaries are, and have been, in compliance with all applicable Laws respecting labor, employment, fair employment practices, terms and conditions of employment, occupational safety and health, civil rights, family and medical leaves and military leaves, and wages and hours. 

  

 (b) Neither Parent nor any of its Subsidiaries is in material breach under any Contract with a labor union or labor organization. Neither Parent nor any of its Subsidiaries is subject to any charge, demand, petition or representation proceeding seeking to compel, require or demand it to bargain with any labor union or labor organization nor is there pending or, to the Knowledge of Parent, threatened, any material labor strike, dispute, walkout, work stoppage, slow-down or lockout involving Parent or any of its Subsidiaries 

   ##### 

  

  

 SECTION 4.13 _Environmental Matters_. Except for those matters that would not reasonably be expected, individually or in the aggregate, to have a Parent Material Adverse Effect, (a) each of Parent and its Subsidiaries is in compliance with Environmental Laws, and has obtained and is in compliance with all necessary Permits that are required under Environmental Laws to operate the facilities, assets and business of the Parent and its Subsidiaries, (b) there are no Environmental Claims pending or, to the Knowledge of Parent, threatened against Parent or any of its Subsidiaries or any real property currently or formerly owned, operated or leased by Parent or any of its Subsidiaries or a predecessor in interest of any of the foregoing that are likely to result in Environmental Liabilities and (c) there has been no Release at any of the real property currently or formerly owned, operated or leased by the Parent or any of its Subsidiaries or a predecessor in interest of any of the foregoing, or, to the Knowledge of the Parent, at any disposal or treatment facility which has received or currently receives Hazardous Materials generated by the Parent or any of its Subsidiaries or any predecessor in interest of any of the foregoing. This Section 4.13 constitutes the sole and exclusive representation and warranty of Parent regarding environmental or, except as set forth in Section 4.12, occupational health and safety matters, or liabilities or obligations relating thereto, or compliance with Laws relating thereto.

 SECTION 4.15 _Stock Ownership_. As of the date hereof, none of Parent, Merger Sub or any of their " _affiliates_ " or " _associates_ " (as defined in Section 203 of the DGCL) beneficially own any Target Common Stock. Neither Parent nor Merger Sub, nor any of their "affiliates" or "associates" (as defined in Section 203 of the DGCL) has been an " _interested stockholder_ " of the Target at any time within three (3) years prior to the date of this Agreement, as those terms are used in Section 203 of the DGCL. 

  

 SECTION 4.16 _Information Supplied_. None of the information supplied or to be supplied by or on behalf of Parent for inclusion (or incorporation by reference) in the Registration Statement or the Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus (or any amendment thereof or supplement thereto) will, on the date it is filed and the date it is first mailed to Target Stockholders and Parent Shareholders and at the time of the Target Stockholders Meeting and the Parent Shareholders Meeting, contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they are made, not misleading. Parent will cause the Registration Statement and the Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus and all related filings with the SEC to comply as to form in all material respects with the requirements of the Securities Act and the Exchange Act, as applicable, and the rules and regulations thereunder applicable thereto as of the dates of such filings or mailings. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no representation is made by Parent with respect to statements made or incorporated by reference therein based on information supplied by Target for inclusion or incorporation by reference in the Registration Statement or the Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus. 

  

 SECTION 4.17 _Opinion of Financial Advisor_. The Board of Directors of Parent has received the separate opinions of Barclays Capital, Inc. and of Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner 

   ##### 

  

 

and Smith Incorporated (the " _Parent Financial Advisors_ "), to the effect
that, as of the date of such opinions and subject to the various assumptions
and qualifications set forth therein, the consideration to be paid by Parent
pursuant to this Agreement is fair to Parent from a financial point of
view. 

   

 SECTION 4.18 _Brokers and Other Advisors_. Except for the Parent Financial Advisors, the fees and expenses of which will be paid by Parent, no broker, investment banker, financial advisor or other Person is entitled to any brokers, finders, financial advisors or other similar fee or commission, or the reimbursement of expenses, in connection with the Merger based upon arrangements made by or on behalf of Parent or any of its Subsidiaries.

Notwithstanding anything contained in this Agreement to the contrary, each of Parent and Merger Sub acknowledges and agrees that (a) neither Target, its Subsidiaries nor any other Person is making any representations or warranties whatsoever, express or implied, beyond those expressly given by Target in Article III, and (b) none of Parent or Merger Sub has been induced by, or relied upon, any representations, warranties or statements (written or oral), whether express or implied, made by Target, its Subsidiaries or any other Person, that are not expressly set forth in Article III. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, each of Parent and Merger Sub acknowledges that no representations or warranties are made by Target or any Person, and none shall be implied, with respect to any projections, forecasts, estimates, budgets or prospects that may have been made available to Parent, Merger Sub or any of their respective Representatives.

Each of Parent and Target shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to respond as promptly as practicable to any comments of the SEC and will use its commercially reasonable efforts to cause the Registration Statement to be declared effective under the Securities Act as promptly as practicable after such filing and to keep the Registration Statement effective as long as is 

   ##### 

  

 

necessary to consummate the Merger and the transactions contemplated hereby.
Without limiting any other provision herein, the Joint Proxy
Statement/Prospectus and the Registration Statement will contain such
information and disclosure reasonably requested by either Parent or Target
so that the Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus and the Registration Statement
conform in form and substance to the requirements of the Exchange Act and the
Securities Act, as applicable. Parent and Target shall each use its
commercially reasonable efforts to cause the Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus
to be mailed to their respective stockholders as promptly as practicable
after the Registration Statement has been declared effective by the SEC. 

   

 (b) Each of Parent and Target shall promptly notify the other of the receipt of any comments from the SEC or its staff and of any request by the SEC or its staff for amendments or supplements to the Registration Statement or the Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus or for additional information and shall supply the other with copies of all correspondence between Parent or any of its representatives or Target or any of its representatives, on the one hand, and the SEC or its staff, on the other hand, with respect to the Registration Statement or the Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus. 

  

 (c) If at any time prior to the Effective Time there shall occur (i) any event with respect to Parent or any of its Subsidiaries, or with respect to other information supplied by Parent for inclusion in the Registration Statement or the Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus, or (ii) any event with respect to Target, or with respect to information supplied by Target for inclusion in the Registration Statement or the Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus, in either case, which event is required to be described in an amendment of or a supplement to the Registration Statement or the Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus, Parent or Target, as the case may be, will promptly inform the other of such occurrence and cooperate in filing with the SEC or its staff, and/or mailing to stockholders of Parent and/or Target, such amendment or supplement. Each of Parent and Target shall cooperate and provide the other (and its counsel) with a reasonable opportunity to review and comment on any amendment or supplement to the Registration Statement and Joint Prospect/Proxy Statement prior to filing such with the SEC, and will provide each other with a copy of all such filings made with the SEC. Neither Parent nor Target shall make any amendment to the Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus or the Registration Statement without the approval of the other party, which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed. 

  

 (d) As soon as reasonably practicable after the Registration Statement is declared effective by the SEC, Parent shall take all action necessary in accordance with Florida Law and its articles of incorporation and bylaws and the rules of the NYSE to call, give notice of, convene and hold a meeting of the Parent Shareholders (including any adjournments or postponements thereof, the " _Parent Shareholders Meeting_ ") for the purpose of seeking the Parent Shareholder Approval, and except as otherwise permitted by Section 5.4, Target shall take all action necessary in accordance with Delaware Law and its certificate of incorporation and bylaws and the rules of the NYSE to call, give notice of, convene and hold a meeting of the Target Stockholders (including any adjournments or postponements thereof, the " _Target Stockholders Meeting_ ") for the purpose of seeking the Target Stockholder Approval, each to be held as promptly as practicable. Each of Parent and Target will use its reasonable best efforts to hold their respective stockholders meetings on the same date. Each of Parent and, subject to Sections 5.4(c), Target will use its reasonable best efforts to solicit the Parent Shareholder 

   ##### 

  

 

Approval and the Target Stockholder Approval, as applicable, and will take all
other action necessary or advisable to secure the vote or consent of its
stockholders required by the rules of the NYSE and Florida or Delaware Law,
as applicable. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this
Agreement, Parent or Target, as the case may be, may adjourn or postpone
its stockholders meeting to the extent necessary (i) to ensure that any
necessary supplement or amendment to the Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus is
provided to its respective stockholders in advance of the vote on the Share
Issuance (in the case of Parent) or the adoption of this Agreement (in the
case of Target), or (ii) if as of the time for which the stockholders meeting
is originally scheduled (as set forth in the Joint Proxy
Statement/Prospectus) there are insufficient shares of capital stock
represented (either in person or by proxy) to constitute a quorum necessary
to conduct the business of such stockholders meeting. Each of Parent and
Target shall ensure that its respective stockholders meeting is called,
noticed, convened, held and conducted, and that all proxies solicited by it
in connection with its stockholders meeting are solicited in compliance with
Florida or Delaware Law, as applicable, its articles or certificate of

negotiations regarding, or furnish to any Person or provide any Person with
access to, any material non-public information with respect to, or knowingly
take any other action to facilitate any inquiries or the making of any
proposal that constitutes, or may reasonably be expected to lead to, an
Acquisition Proposal. Target shall promptly take the steps necessary to inform
its Representatives of the obligations undertaken in this Section 5.4(a) and
Target agrees that it shall be responsible for any breach of this Section
5.4(a) by such Representatives as if such Representatives were parties to
this Section 5.4(a). 

   

 (b) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, Target may, in response to a bona fide written Acquisition Proposal that was unsolicited and did not otherwise result from a breach of this Section 5.4 and that is received at any time prior to the receipt of the Target Stockholder Approval, and which the Board of Directors of Target determines, in good faith, after consultation with outside counsel and financial advisors and with such clarification from the Person making the Acquisition Proposal about terms and conditions as the Board of Directors of Target reasonably requests, is, or may reasonably be expected to lead to, a Superior Proposal, (A) furnish information with respect to Target and its Subsidiaries to the Person making such Acquisition Proposal and its Representatives pursuant to a customary confidentiality agreement not less restrictive of the other party than the Target Confidentiality Agreement (an " _Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement_ ") and (B) participate in discussions or negotiations with such Person and its Representatives regarding such prior Acquisition Proposal, but, in the case of each of clauses (A) and (B) above, only to the extent that, upon the advice of outside counsel to the Board of Directors of Target, the failure to do so would result in a breach of the fiduciary duties of the Board of Directors of Target to the Target Stockholders under applicable Law; provided, however, that Target shall give Parent at least 48 hours written notice of its intention to take any such action and provide to Parent, concurrently with the provision of any non-public information concerning Target or any Subsidiary thereof to the Person making such Acquisition Proposal or its Representatives, a list of such non-public information and copies of any such non-public information that was not previously provided to Parent. 

  

 (c) Prior to the final adjournment of the Target Stockholders Meeting, except as expressly permitted by this Section 5.4(c), neither the Board of Directors of Target nor any committee thereof shall (i) (x) fail to make, withdraw, modify or amend, or publicly propose or resolve to withhold, withdraw, modify or amend, in a manner adverse to Parent or Merger Sub, the Target Board Recommendation, (y) recommend, adopt, approve or submit to a vote of its stockholders, or publicly propose to recommend, adopt, approve or submit to a vote of its stockholders, any alternative Acquisition Proposal, including any Superior Proposal or (z) in the event a tender or exchange offer for Target Common Stock that would, if consummated in accordance with its terms, constitute an Acquisition Transaction is commenced by a Person unaffiliated with Parent, fail to, within ten (10) Business Days after the public announcement of the commencement of such Acquisition Proposal, issue a public statement (and file a Schedule 14D-9) reaffirming the Target Board Recommendation and recommending that the Target Stockholders reject such Acquisition Proposal and not tender any shares of Target Common Stock into such tender or exchange offer (any action described in clause (x), clause (y) or clause (z) immediately above being referred to herein as a " _Target Adverse Recommendation Change_ ") or (ii) enter into any merger agreement, letter of intent, agreement in principle, stock purchase agreement, asset purchase agreement or stock exchange agreement, option agreement or other agreement, in each case providing for or relating to an Acquisition Proposal (each, a " _Target_  

   ##### 

  

    

 _Acquisition Agreement_ ") other than an Acceptable Confidentiality
Agreement entered into in accordance with Section 5.4(b). Notwithstanding the
preceding sentence, if, and only if, at any time prior to the final
adjournment of the Target Stockholders Meeting (1) the Target receives a bona
fide written Acquisition Proposal that was unsolicited and did not otherwise
result from a breach of this Section 5.4, (2) such Acquisition Proposal is a
Superior Proposal and (3) the Board of Directors of Target determines in good
faith, after consultation with its outside legal counsel and financial
advisors, that the failure to take such actions would result in a breach of
the fiduciary duties of the Board of Directors of Target to Target
Stockholders under applicable Law, then, provided that (I) the Target has
provided Parent a least three (3) Business Days prior written notice of such
proposal (" _Superior Proposal Notice_ "), advising Parent therein that the
Board of Directors of Target has received a Superior Proposal that it intends
to accept, specifying therein the terms and conditions of such Superior
Proposal and identifying therein the Person making such Superior Proposal,
(II) for a period of not less than three (3) Business Days after Parents
receipt of such Superior Proposal Notice, Target has, if so requested by
Parent, negotiated in good faith with Parent to amend or modify this
Agreement so that the Superior Proposal no longer constitutes a Superior
Proposal and (III) the Target Board determines in good faith, after consulting
with outside legal counsel, that such Acquisition Proposal continues to
constitute a Superior Proposal after taking into account any adjustments made
by Parent during such period in the terms and conditions of this Agreement,
then subject to the procedures set forth in Section 5.4(f), the Target Board
may take any of the actions set forth in clause (i) or (ii) of the first
sentence of this Section 5.4(c) so long as the Target has terminated this
Agreement in accordance with Section 7.1(d)(1) or this Agreement is deemed,
as provided in Section 5.4(f), to have been terminated in accordance with
Section 7.1(c)(2)(x) and, except to the extent Parent is not entitled
thereto pursuant to Section 5.4(f), Target shall have paid all amounts due to
Parent pursuant to Section 7.3. 

  

 (d) In addition to the obligations of Target set forth in subsections (a) through (c) above, Target shall promptly advise Parent of any request for information or the submission or receipt of any Acquisition Proposal, or any inquiry with respect to or that could lead to any Acquisition Proposal, the material terms and conditions of such request, Acquisition Proposal or inquiry, and the identity of the Person making any such request, Acquisition Proposal or inquiry and the Targets response or responses thereto. Target shall keep Parent reasonably informed on a prompt and reasonably current basis as to the status and details (including amendments or proposed amendments) of any such request, Acquisition Proposal or inquiry, including by providing Parent with each draft of any proposed Target Acquisition Agreement. Target shall promptly provide to Parent copies of all written correspondence or other written material, including material in electronic written form, between Target and any Person making any such request, Acquisition Proposal or inquiry. Upon the execution of this Agreement, Target will immediately cease and cause to be terminated any existing activities, discussions or negotiations with any parties conducted heretofore with respect to any of the foregoing and will promptly request that all Persons provided confidential information concerning Target and its Subsidiaries pursuant to a confidentiality agreement return to Target all such confidential information, without keeping copies thereof (if permissible under such agreement), in accordance with such confidentiality agreement. 

  

 (e) Prior to the termination of this Agreement in accordance with Article VII, neither the Board of Directors of Parent nor any committee thereof shall withdraw or modify in a 

   ##### 

  

    

manner adverse to Target, either (x) the approval, recommendation or
declaration of advisability by such Board of Directors or any such committee
thereof of the Share Issuance or the other Transactions contemplated by this
Agreement or (y) the determination by such Board of Directors or any
such committee thereof that the Share Issuance is in the best interests of
the Parent Shareholders. 

  

 (f) Except as expressly set forth in this Section 5.4(f) (and notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained elsewhere in this Agreement), the obligation of Target to call, give notice of, convene and hold the Target Stockholders Meeting shall not be limited or otherwise affected by the commencement, disclosure, announcement or submission to it of any Acquisition Proposal or by any Target Adverse Recommendation Change. If the Target effects a Target Adverse Recommendation Change, Parent shall have the option, exercisable within ten (10) Business Days after such Target Adverse Recommendation Change, to cause the Board of Directors of the Target to submit this Agreement to its stockholders for the purpose of adopting this Agreement notwithstanding the Target Adverse Recommendation Change. If Parent exercises such option, it shall not be entitled to terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 7.1(c)(2)(x). If Parent does not exercise such option, this Agreement shall be deemed terminated pursuant to Section 7.1(c)(2)(x) upon the expiration of such ten (10) Business Day period. Nothing shall limit or otherwise affect the obligation of Parent to call, give notice of, convene and hold the Parent Shareholders Meeting. 

  

 (g) Nothing contained in this Section 5.4 (or elsewhere in the this Agreement) shall prohibit Parent or Target or their respective Board of Directors from taking and disclosing to the Parent Shareholders or Target Stockholders, as the case may be, a position with respect to a tender offer contemplated by Rule 14d-9 or Rule 14e-2(a) promulgated under the Exchange Act or from making any disclosure to the Target Stockholders if, in the good faith judgment of the Board of Directors of Target, after consultation with outside counsel and upon receipt of the advice thereof, failure to so disclose would be inconsistent with its obligations under applicable Law; provided, that the content of any such disclosure thereunder shall be governed by the terms of this Agreement. 

  

 (h) For purposes of this Agreement, the following terms shall have the meanings set for the below: 

  

 " _Acquisition Proposal_ " means a proposal or offer from, or indication of interest in making a proposal or offer by, any Person (other than Parent and its Subsidiaries, including Merger Sub), relating to (i) a merger, consolidation, dissolution, recapitalization or other business combination (whether in a single transaction or series of related transactions) involving Target or any of its Subsidiaries, in each case other than the Merger, provided, however, that nothing contained herein shall prohibit Target from consolidating, dissolving or combining any of its wholly owned Subsidiaries, (ii) the issuance by Target of over 20% of the Target Common Stock as consideration for the assets or securities of another Person, in each case other than the Merger, (iii) the acquisition in any manner, directly or indirectly, of over 20% of the Target Common Stock or consolidated total assets of Target or to which 20% of or more the Targets revenues or earnings on a consolidated basis are attributable, in each case other than the Merger, (iv) an acquisition or disposition the consummation of which would essentially prevent the consummation of the Merger, (v) any tender offer or exchange offer that, if consummated, would 

   ##### 

  

    

result in any " _Person_ " or " _group_ " of " _Persons_ " (as such terms are
used in Sections 13(d) and 14(d) of the Exchange Act) owning 20% or more of
any class of equity securities of Target or (vi) the payment of an
extraordinary dividend (whether in cash or other property) by Target. 

  

 " _Superior Proposal_ " means a proposal to acquire, directly or indirectly, for consideration consisting of cash, securities or a combination thereof, more than 50% of the Target Common Stock or all or substantially all of the assets of Target and its Subsidiaries on a consolidated basis, made by a third party, and which is otherwise on terms and conditions that the Board of Directors of Target determines in good faith (after consultation with outside counsel and outside financial advisors) to be more favorable to the Target Stockholders than the Merger and the other Transactions. 

  

 SECTION 5.5 _Reasonable Best Efforts_. Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, each of the parties hereto shall cooperate with the other parties and use (and shall cause their respective Subsidiaries to use) their respective reasonable best efforts promptly to take, or cause to be taken, all actions, and do, or cause to be done, all things, necessary, proper or advisable to (i) cause the conditions to Closing to be satisfied as promptly as practicable, (ii) obtain all approvals, consents, registrations, permits, authorizations and other confirmations from any third party to consummate the Merger and the other Transactions and (iii) consummate and make effective, in the most expeditious manner practicable, the Merger and the other Transactions. Without limitation of the preceding sentence, prior to the Effective Time, the Target shall (and the Target shall cause each of its Subsidiaries to) provide, and shall, subject to Section 5.17, use its commercially reasonable efforts to cause its Representatives to provide, all cooperation reasonably requested by Parent in connection with Parents arrangement of the financing necessary to effect the Merger. 

  

 SECTION 5.6 _HSR Act and other Governmental Approvals_. 

  

 (a) Without limitation of Section 5.5, each of the parties hereto shall use (and shall cause their respective Subsidiaries to use) their respective reasonable best efforts promptly and fully to (i) prepare and file all documentation to effect all necessary filings, notices, petitions, statements, registrations, submissions of information, applications and other documents (including any required filings under the HSR Act) and (ii) obtain all approvals, consents, registrations, permits, authorizations and other confirmations from any Governmental Authority necessary to consummate the Merger and the other Transactions. In furtherance and not in limitation of the foregoing, (A) each party hereto agrees, subject to Section 5.6(b), to (I) make the filing, if required of such party, pursuant to the HSR Act as promptly as practicable and in any event within ten (10) Business Days of the date hereof, (II) comply at the earliest practicable date with any request under the HSR Act or any other antitrust Law for additional information, documents or other materials received by such party from a Governmental Authority, (III) act in good faith and reasonably cooperate with the other parties in connection with any such registrations, declarations and filings (including, in the case of the Target, by accepting all reasonable additions, deletions or changes suggested by Parent in connection therewith) and in connection with resolving any investigation or other inquiry of any Governmental Authority under the HSR Act or any other antitrust Law with respect to any such registration, declaration and filing and (IV) use its reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all other actions consistent with this Section 5.6 necessary to cause the expiration or termination of the applicable 

   ##### 

  

    

waiting periods under the HSR Act or any other antitrust Law as soon as
practicable; and (B) Target and Parent shall each use its reasonable best
efforts to (I) take all action necessary to ensure that no state takeover
statute or similar Law is or becomes applicable to the Merger or any of
the other Transactions and (II) if any state takeover statute or similar Law
becomes applicable to the Merger or any of the other Transactions, take all
action necessary to ensure that the Merger and the other Transactions may be
consummated as promptly as practicable on the terms contemplated by this
Agreement and otherwise minimize the effect of such Law on the Merger or other
Transactions. 

  

 (b) Parent, Merger Sub and Target each shall consult with the other in connection with, and promptly supply the other with any information which may be required in order to effectuate, any filings or applications pursuant to Section 5.6(a) (collectively, " _Filings and Applications_ "), any analyses, appearances, presentations, memoranda, briefs, white papers, arguments, opinions and proposals (collectively, " _Briefings_ "), including in connection with any investigations or proceedings in connection with this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby (including under any antitrust or fair trade Law), and any material communication received or given in connection with any proceeding by a private party relating to the Merger. Except where prohibited or otherwise required by applicable Law, and subject to the terms of the Target Confidentiality Agreement and the Parent Confidentiality Agreement, Target shall not file or submit any Filings and Applications to any Governmental Authority by or on behalf of any party hereto or take a position with respect to any Briefing without the consent of Parent. In all events, Target shall take into account Parents good faith comments and recommendations with respect to any Filings and Applications or Briefings and reflect the same in such Filings and Applications or Briefings. Parent and Target each shall coordinate with the other in preparing and exchanging information, and shall promptly provide the other (and its counsel) with copies of all filings, presentations or submissions (and a summary of any oral communications) made by such party with any Governmental Authority in connection with this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby. It is acknowledged and agreed that Parent shall have, except where prohibited by applicable Law, responsibility for determining the strategy for dealing with the Federal Trade Commission, the Antitrust Division of the United States Department of Justice or any other Governmental Authority with responsibility for reviewing the Merger with respect to antitrust or competition issues. Subject to applicable Law, no party hereto shall independently participate in any substantive meeting, telephone call, or discussion with any Governmental Authority in respect of any such filings, applications, Briefings, investigation, proceeding or other inquiry without giving the other parties hereto prior notice of such meeting, telephone call or discussion and, to the extent permitted by such Governmental Authority, the opportunity to attend and participate. Target and Parent may, as each deems advisable and necessary, reasonably designate any competitively sensitive material provided to the other under this Section 5.6 as " _Antitrust Counsel Only Material_." Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Section 5.6, materials provided to the other party or its counsel may be redacted (y) to remove references concerning the valuation of Target and its Subsidiaries; and (z) as necessary to address reasonable attorney-client or other privilege or confidentiality concerns. 

  

 (c) Each of Parent, Merger Sub and Target will notify the other promptly upon the receipt of: (i) any communications from any officials of any Governmental Authority in connection with any filings made pursuant hereto, and (ii) any request by any officials of any 

   ##### 

  

    

Governmental Authority for amendments or supplements to any filings made
pursuant to, or information provided to comply in all material respects with,
any Law. Whenever any event occurs that is required to be set forth in an
amendment or supplement to any filing made pursuant to Section 5.6(a), Parent,
Merger Sub or Target, as the case may be, will promptly inform the other of
such occurrence and cooperate in filing with the applicable Governmental
Authority such amendment or supplement, all in accordance with the provisions
of Section 5.6(b). 

  

 (d) In furtherance and not in limitation of the covenants of the parties contained in this Section 5.6, each of the parties hereto shall use its reasonable best efforts to resolve such objections, if any, as may be asserted by a Governmental Authority or other Person with respect to the Merger. Without limiting any other provision hereof, Parent and Target shall each use its reasonable best efforts to avoid the entry of, or to have vacated or terminated, any decree, order or judgment that would restrain, prevent or delay the consummation of the Merger or the other Transactions, on or before the Outside Date. 

  

 (e) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement Parent shall not be obligated to defend through litigation on the merits any claim asserted in court by any third party under any antitrust, competition or trade regulation law in order to avoid entry of, or to have vacated or terminated, any decree, order or judgment (whether temporary, preliminary, or permanent) that would prevent or materially delay the Closing of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement). 

  

 (f) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, nothing contained in this Agreement shall be deemed to require Parent or Target or any Subsidiary or affiliate thereof to agree to or effect any prohibition, license, limitation, or other requirement that would prohibit or materially restrict, in Parents reasonable judgment, the ownership or operation by Target or any of its Subsidiaries, or by Parent or any of its Subsidiaries, of all or, in Parents reasonable judgment, any material portion of the business or assets of Target and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, or Parent and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, or compel Parent or any of its Subsidiaries to agree to or to dispose of or hold separate all or, in Parents reasonable judgment, any material portion of the business or assets of Target and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, or Parent and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole (together, the " _Burdensome Conditions_ "). 

  

 SECTION 5.7 _Press Releases_. Each of Parent and Merger Sub, on the one hand, and Target, on the other hand, shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to consult with each other before issuing, and, to the extent reasonably feasible, provide each other the opportunity to review and comment upon, any press release or other public statements with respect to the Merger and the other Transactions and shall not issue any such press release or make any such public statement prior to such consultation, except as may be required by applicable Law, court process or by obligations pursuant to any listing agreement with any national securities exchange. 

  

 SECTION 5.8 _Access to Information; Confidentiality_. (a) Subject to compliance with applicable Law, Target shall, and shall cause each of its Subsidiaries to, afford to Parent and its officers, employees, accountants, counsel, financial advisors and other representatives (collectively, the " _Parent Representatives_ "), reasonable access during normal business hours during the period prior to the Effective Time to all their respective properties, books, contracts, 

   ##### 

  

    

commitments, personnel and records and shall cause its and its Subsidiaries
outside counsel, accountants and financial advisors to cooperate with Parent

Subsidiaries and, during such period, shall, and shall cause each of its
Subsidiaries to, furnish promptly to Parent and the Parent Representatives (a)
a copy of each report, schedule, registration statement and other document
filed by it during such period pursuant to the requirements of applicable Law
(including federal and state securities laws) and (b) all other information
concerning its and its Subsidiaries business, properties and personnel as
Parent or any of the Parent Representatives may reasonably request, provided
that Target shall not have any obligation to deliver any such information to
the extent that Target determines, in it sole and absolution discretion, that
such information is of a competitive nature or sensitive to the operations of
Target or any of its Subsidiaries. All information provided pursuant to this
Section 5.8(a) shall be subject to the confidentiality agreement, dated April
1, 2010 between Target and Parent (the " _Confidentiality Agreement_ "). 

  

 (b) Subject to compliance with applicable Law, Parent shall, provide to Target and its officers, employees, accountants, counsel, financial advisors and other representatives (collectively, the " _Target Representatives_ "), such information concerning its and its Subsidiaries business, properties and personnel as Target or any of the Target Representatives may reasonably request; provided that Parent shall not have any obligation to deliver any such information to the extent that Parent determines, in it sole and absolution discretion, that such information is of a competitive nature or sensitive to the operations of Parent or any of its Subsidiaries. All information provided pursuant to this Section 5.8(b) shall be subject to the Confidentiality Agreement. 

  

 SECTION 5.9 _Notification of Certain Matters_. Target shall give prompt notice to Parent, and Parent shall give prompt notice to Target, of (a) any notice or other communication received by such party from any Governmental Authority in connection with the Merger and the other Transactions or from any Person alleging that the consent of such Person is or may be required in connection with the Merger and the other Transactions, if the subject matter of such communication or the failure of such party to obtain such consent could be material to Target, the Surviving Company or Parent, (b) any material actions, suits, claims, investigations or proceedings commenced or, to such partys Knowledge, threatened against, relating to or involving or otherwise affecting such party or any of its Subsidiaries which relate to the Merger and the other Transactions, (c) the occurrence, or non-occurrence, of any event the occurrence or non-occurrence of which would be reasonably likely to cause (i) any representation or warranty of such party contained in this Agreement to be untrue or inaccurate in any material respect, (ii) any covenant or agreement of such party contained in this Agreement not to be complied with or satisfied in any material respect, or (iii) any condition (to the extent set forth in Article VI) to the obligation of another party to effect the Merger and the satisfaction of which requires performance or nonperformance by such notifying party not to be satisfied, and (d) any failure of such party to comply with or satisfy in any material respect any covenant, condition or agreement to be complied with or satisfied by it hereunder; provided, however, that the delivery of any notice pursuant to this Section 5.9 shall not have any effect for the purpose of determining the satisfaction of conditions set forth in Article VI or otherwise limit or affect the remedies available hereunder to any party. Subject to applicable Law regarding the sharing of information, Target shall give prompt notice of and disclose to Parent any material actions taken by its Board of Directors, or any committees thereof, provided that Target shall not be required 

   ##### 

  

    

to provide notice and disclosure (i) with respect to any action that is

(except to the extent otherwise required by Section 5.4) or (ii) prior to the
execution of any joint defense agreement that is reasonably required by
Target, material information subject to the attorney-client privilege,

withheld pursuant to this clause (ii). 

  

 SECTION 5.10 _Indemnification and Insurance_. 

  

 (a) From and after the Effective Time, Parent shall, and shall cause the Surviving Company to (i) indemnify and hold harmless each individual who at the Effective Time is, or at any time prior to the Effective Time was, a member of the Board of Directors (or committee thereof) of Target or a Subsidiary of Target, or a director or officer of Target or a Subsidiary of Target (each, an " _Indemnitee_ " and, collectively, the " _Indemnitees_ ") with respect to all claims, liabilities, losses, damages, judgments, fines, penalties, costs (including amounts paid in settlement or compromise) and expenses (including fees and expenses of legal counsel) in connection with any claim, suit, action, proceeding or investigation (whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative), whenever asserted, based on or arising out of, in whole or in part, acts or omissions by an Indemnitee in the Indemnitees capacity as a member of the Board of Directors (or committee thereof) of Target or a Subsidiary of Target, or as a director, officer, employee or agent of Target or a Subsidiary of Target, or taken at the request of Target or a Subsidiary of Target (including in connection with serving at the request of Target or a Subsidiary of Target as a member of the Board of Directors (or committee thereof) or director, officer, employee or agent of another Person (including any employee benefit plan)), at, or at any time prior to, the Effective Time (including in connection with the Merger and the other Transactions), to the fullest extent permitted under applicable Law, and (ii) assume all obligations of Target and its Subsidiaries to the Indemnitees in respect of indemnification and exculpation from liabilities for acts or omissions occurring at or prior to the Effective Time as provided in (A) the organizational documents of Target and its Subsidiaries as currently in effect on the date of this Agreement and (B) the indemnification agreements listed on Schedule 5.10, which shall survive the Merger and the other Transactions and continue in full force and effect in accordance with their respective terms. Without limiting the foregoing, Parent, from and after the Effective Time, to the extent permitted by applicable Law, shall cause the organizational documents of the Surviving Company to contain provisions no less favorable in the aggregate to the Indemnitees with respect to limitation of liabilities of members of the Board of Directors (or committees thereof), directors, and officers and indemnification than are set forth as of the date of this Agreement in the organizational documents of Target, which provisions, to the extent permitted by Law, shall not be amended, repealed or otherwise modified in a manner that would adversely affect the rights thereunder of the Indemnitees. In addition, from and after the Effective Time, Parent shall, and shall cause the Surviving Company to, advance funds for any expenses (including fees and expenses of legal counsel) of any Indemnitee under this Section 5.10 (including in connection with enforcing the indemnity and other obligations provided for in this Section 5.10) in advance of the final disposition of any such claim, suit, action, proceeding or investigation, as incurred to the fullest extent permitted under applicable Law, provided that the person to whom expenses are advanced provides an undertaking to repay such advances to the extent it is ultimately determined that such person is not entitled to indemnification under this Section 5.10. 

   ##### 

  

  

 (b) The Surviving Company shall have the right, but not the obligation, to assume and control the defense of any litigation, claim or proceeding relating to any acts or omissions covered under this Section 5.10 (each, a " _Claim_ ") with counsel selected by the Surviving Company, which counsel shall be reasonably acceptable to the affected Indemnitee; provided, however, that an Indemnitee shall be permitted to participate in the defense of such Claim at its own expense. Each of Parent, the Surviving Company and the Indemnitee shall cooperate in the defense of any Claim and shall provide access to properties and individuals as reasonably requested and furnish or cause to be furnished records, information and testimony, and attend such conferences, discovery proceedings, hearings, trials or appeals, as may be reasonably requested in connection therewith. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if there is a conflict of interest between the Surviving Company and any Indemnitee with respect to the defense of any Claim (based on the written opinion of counsel to such Indemnitee, which opinion and counsel shall be reasonably acceptable to the Surviving Company), the Indemnitee shall be permitted to participate in, and control, the defense of such Claim, but only to the extent that it relates to the Indemnitee, with counsel selected by the Indemnitee, and Parent shall cause the Surviving Company to pay the reasonable fees and expenses of such counsel, as accrued and in advance of the final disposition of such Claim, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable Law; provided, however, that the Surviving Company shall not be obligated to pay the reasonable fees and expenses of more than one counsel (in addition to any necessary local counsel) for all Indemnitees in any single claim except to the extent that Indemnitees have conflicting interests in the outcome of such Claim. 

  

 (c) Prior to the Effective Time, Target shall purchase an extended reporting period endorsement or a "tail" policy covering acts or omissions occurring at or prior to the Effective Time with respect to those persons who are currently (and any additional persons who prior to the Effective Time become) covered by Targets current directors and officers liability insurance policy as of the date of this Agreement, which shall provide such directors and officers coverage for six (6) years following the Effective Time on terms with respect to such coverage, and in an aggregate amount, not less favorable to such individuals than those of such policy in effect on the date hereof; provided, however, that, if the aggregate cost for such insurance exceeds $2.0 million (the " _Premium Limit_ "), then, in lieu of the foregoing extended reporting period endorsement or "tail" policy, Target shall provide or cause to be provided an extended reporting period endorsement or "tail" policy for the applicable individuals with the best coverage as shall then be available for the Premium Limit; provided, further, however, that, subject to the limitation set forth in the immediately preceding proviso, at no time shall the aggregate amount of such coverage be less than the aggregate amount of the directors and officers liability insurance coverage then provided by Parent to its directors and officers. 

  

 (d) The provisions of this Section 5.10 are (i) intended to be for the benefit of, and shall be enforceable by, each Indemnitee, his or her heirs and his or her representatives and (ii) in addition to, and not in substitution for, any other rights to indemnification or contribution that any such Person may have by contract or otherwise. The obligations of Parent and the Surviving Company under this Section 5.10 shall not be terminated or modified in such a manner as to adversely affect the rights of any Indemnitee to whom this Section 5.10 applies unless (x) such termination or modification is required by applicable Law or (y) the affected Indemnitee shall have consented in writing to such termination or modification (it being expressly agreed 

   #####

   ##### 

  

    

or Target or their respective directors, officers and Affiliates in respect of

 (b) In the event of the termination of this Agreement pursuant to Section 7.1(b)(3) or Section 7.1(c)(1), Target shall reimburse Parent, by wire transfer of same-day funds, the reasonable and documented out-of-pocket fees and expenses (not to exceed $2 million) incurred by Parent, Merger Sub and their respective Affiliates in connection with this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby, within five (5) Business Days after the date of such termination (the " _Parent-Related Fees and Expenses_ "). In the event of the termination of this Agreement pursuant to Section 7.1(b)(4) or Section 7.1(d)(2), Parent shall reimburse Target, by wire transfer of same-day funds, the reasonable and documented out-of-pocket fees and expenses (not to exceed $2 million) incurred by Target and its respective Affiliates in connection with this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby, within five (5) Business Days after the date of such termination (the " _Target-Related Fees and Expenses_ "). 

  

 (c) (i) In the event of the termination of this Agreement pursuant to Sections 7.1(c)(2) or 7.1(d)(1) (except, with respect to Section 7.1(c)(2)(x), to the extent otherwise provided in Section 5.4(f)), Target shall pay Parent, by wire transfer of same-day funds, a termination fee of $12 million (the " _Target Termination Fee_ ") on the date of such termination, and reimburse Parent, by wire transfer of same-day funds, Parent-Related Fees and Expenses, within five (5) Business Days after the date of such termination. In the event of the termination of this Agreement pursuant to Sections 7.1(b)(1), 7.1(b)(3) or 7.1(c)(1), if any Acquisition Proposal which had been received by Target or publicly announced prior to such termination is consummated no later than the 12-month anniversary of the date of such termination, Target shall pay Parent, by wire transfer of same-day funds, the Target Termination Fee, on the date of the consummation of such Acquisition Proposal, and reimburse Parent, by wire transfer of same-day funds, Parent-Related Fees and Expenses, within five (5) Business Days after the date of such consummation. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, Parents receipt of the Target Termination Fee and/or the Parent-Related Fees and Expenses from Target pursuant to and on the terms and conditions provided for in this Section 7.3(c)(i) shall, subject to Section 8.8, be the sole and exclusive remedy of Parent against Target or any of its affiliates or any former, current or future stockholder, controlling person, director, officer, employee, agent or assignee of any of the foregoing for any loss suffered as a result of a termination of this Agreement as described above in this section 7.3(c)(i), and upon payment to Parent of the entire amount of such amounts, no former, current or future stockholder, controlling person, director, officer, employee, agent or assignee of Target or any of its affiliates shall have any further liability or obligation relating to or arising out of this Agreement or the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. For the avoidance of doubt, in the event of a termination of this Agreement as described above in this section 7.3(c)(i), under no circumstances will Parent be entitled to monetary damages in excess of the amount of the Termination Fee and/or the 

   ##### 

  

    

Parent-Related Fees and Expenses, as applicable, and in all other cases,
Parent and Merger Sub shall be free to pursue any and all remedies
under applicable law. Nothing contained herein shall limit Targets ability

Agreement by Parent or Merger Sub. 

  

 (ii) Nothing in this Agreement, including the preceding provisions of this Section 7.3(c), shall relieve any party from liability for fraud or a knowing and intentional breach of this Agreement. In the event of such fraud or a knowing and intentional breach, the damaged party, on its own behalf and for the benefit of its stockholders, shall be entitled to recover from any parties liable therefor, under any legal theory, all damages caused by such fraud or breach (including, without limitation, consequential damages and any damages measured on the basis of the benefit of the bargain intended to be conferred hereunder), and to obtain any and all other legal and equitable relief whatsoever, including specific performance, that may be available to such party at law or in equity, on its own behalf and for the benefit of its stockholders. 

  

 (iii) Each party hereto acknowledges that the amount of actual damages which would be incurred by Parent as a result of a termination of this Agreement pursuant to any of the circumstances set forth in Section 7.3(c)(i) would be difficult to ascertain and that the right of payment under this Section 7.3(c) constitutes a reasonable estimate of such damages. In the event that Parent receives full payment of the Target Termination Fee pursuant to Section 7.3(c)(i), the receipt of such payment shall be deemed to be liquidated damages for any and all losses or damages suffered or incurred by Parent, any of its Affiliates or any other person in connection with this Agreement (and the termination hereof), the transactions contemplated hereby (and the abandonment thereof) or any matter forming the basis for such termination, subject only to Section 7.3(c)(ii) and Section 8.8. 

  

 (d) The parties acknowledge that the agreements contained in this Section 7.3 are an integral part of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and that, without these agreements, the parties would not enter into this Agreement. Accordingly, if either of Target or Parent (the " _Obligated Party_ ") fails to timely pay any amount due to the other (the " _Other Party_ ") pursuant to this Section 7.3, and in order to obtain such payment, the Other Party commences a suit which results in a judgment against the Obligated Party for a payment set forth in this Section 7.3, the Obligated Party shall pay to the Other Party its reasonable costs and expenses (including reasonable attorneys fees and expenses) in connection with such suit (and in any suit to collect such costs and expenses), together with pre-judgment interest on the amount due at the prime rate of Citibank, N.A. in effect on the date any such payment was required to be made.
