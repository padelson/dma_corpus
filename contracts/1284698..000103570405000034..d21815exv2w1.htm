 3.4 _UGC Election Procedures; Proration_.   

 (a) Not less than three business days prior to the mailing of the Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus, LMI shall designate a bank or trust company to act as exchange agent hereunder (the " _Exchange Agent_ ") for the purpose of exchanging (x) certificates that immediately prior to the Effective Time represented shares of UGC Common Stock (the " _UGC Certificates_ ") and shares of UGC Common Stock represented by book-entry (" _UGC Book-Entry Shares_ ") and (y) certificates that immediately prior to the Effective Time represented shares of LMI Common Stock (the " _LMI Certificates_ " and, together with the UGC Certificates, the " _Certificates_ ") and shares of LMI Common Stock represented by book-entry (" _LMI Book-Entry Shares_ " and, together with UGC Book-Entry Shares, the " _Book-Entry Shares_ ").   

 (b) Each Person who, on or prior to the Election Time (as defined below), is a record holder of shares of UGC Common Stock (other than a holder of Excluded Shares and other than a Wholly-Owned Subsidiary of UGC) shall be entitled to specify the number of such holderÂ’s shares of UGC Common Stock (and, if such shares to which the election relates are represented by UGC Certificates, such particular shares) with respect to which such holder makes a Cash Election or Stock Election.   

 (c) HoldCo shall prepare and file as an exhibit to the Registration Statement a form of election (the " _Form of Election_ "). The Form of Election shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to any UGC Certificates shall pass, only upon proper delivery of the Form of Election and any UGC Certificates to the Exchange Agent. UGC shall mail the Form of Election with the Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus to all Persons who are record holders of shares of UGC Common Stock (other than holders of Excluded Shares) as of the record date for the UGC Special Meeting. The Form of Election shall be used by each record holder of shares of UGC Common Stock (other than holders of Excluded Shares), or, in the case of nominee record holders, the beneficial owner through proper instructions and documentation, who wishes to make a Cash Election or a Stock Election or a combination of both for any and all shares of UGC Common Stock held by such holder. UGC shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to make the Form of Election available to all Persons who become     ##### 

 

   

holders of shares of UGC Common Stock during the period between the record
date for the UGC Special Meeting and the date of the UGC Special
Meeting.    

 (d) Any holderÂ’s election shall have been properly made only if the Exchange Agent shall have received at its designated office, by 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on (i) the date of the later of the two Special Meetings or (ii) if the Closing Date is more than four business days following the later of the two Special Meetings, the second business day preceding the Closing Date (the " _Election Time_ "), a Form of Election properly completed and signed and accompanied by (i) certificates representing the shares of UGC Common Stock to which such Form of Election relates, duly endorsed in blank or otherwise in form acceptable for transfer on the books of UGC or (ii) in the case of UGC Book-Entry Shares, any additional documents required by the procedures set forth in the Form of Election. After a Cash Election or a Stock Election is validly made with respect to any shares of UGC Common Stock, no further registration of transfers of such shares shall be made on the stock transfer books of UGC unless and until such Cash Election or Stock Election is properly revoked. If the Closing Date is anticipated to be more than four business days following the later of the two Special Meetings, then as soon as reasonably practicable, but in no event later than 9:00 a.m., New York City time, on the business day immediately following the date of the later of the two Special Meetings, LMI and UGC shall so notify the holders of UGC Common Stock by issuing a release to the Dow Jones News Service specifying the anticipated Closing Date, which shall not be earlier than the fourth business day after the date of the release. Any Cash Election or Stock Election may be revoked with respect to all or a portion of the shares of UGC Common Stock subject thereto by the holder who submitted the applicable Form of Election by written notice received by the Exchange Agent prior to the Election Time. In addition, all Cash Elections and Stock Elections shall automatically be revoked if this Agreement is terminated in accordance with Article IX. If a Cash Election or Stock Election is properly revoked (x) the UGC Certificates representing such shares shall be returned to the record owner thereof or such other Person as such record owner shall have set forth in such ownerÂ’s Form of Election, and (y) all UGC Book-Entry Shares representing such shares shall be credited to such book-entry account as shall have been set forth in the Form of Election relating thereto.   

 (e) The determination of the Exchange Agent (or the joint determination of LMI and UGC, in the event that the Exchange Agent declines to make any such determination) shall be conclusive and binding as to whether or not Cash Elections, Stock Elections or revocations shall have been properly made or revoked pursuant to this Section 3.4 and as to when Cash Elections, Stock Elections and revocations were received by the Exchange Agent. The Exchange Agent (or LMI and UGC jointly, in the event that the Exchange Agent declines to make the following computation) shall also make all computations as to the proration contemplated by Section 3.4(f), and absent manifest error this computation shall be conclusive and binding. The Exchange Agent may, with the written agreement of each of LMI and    ##### 

  

 

UGC, make any rules as are consistent with this Section 3.4 for the
implementation of the Cash Elections and Stock Elections provided for in this
Agreement as shall be necessary or desirable to effect the Cash Elections and
Stock Elections in accordance with the terms of this Agreement.    

 (f) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, the number of shares of UGC Common Stock converted into the Cash Consideration may not exceed the UGC Share Threshold Number. If the aggregate number of shares of UGC Common Stock with respect to which the Cash Election is validly made and not validly revoked (the " _Total Cash Election Number_ ") exceeds the UGC Share Threshold Number, then (i) all shares of UGC Common Stock as to which a Stock Election or Deemed Stock Election is made shall be converted into and represent the right to receive, and will be exchangeable for, the Stock Consideration and (ii) the number of shares of UGC Common Stock as to which a Cash Election is validly made and not validly revoked by a UGC stockholder pursuant to Section 3.4 that shall be converted into and represent the right to receive, and will be exchangeable for, the Cash Consideration, shall be equal to the product (rounded down to the nearest whole number) obtained by multiplying (A) the number of shares of UGC Common Stock held by such stockholder as to which such stockholder has validly made and not validly revoked a Cash Election by (B) a fraction, the numerator of which is the UGC Share Threshold Number and the denominator of which is the Total Cash Election Number, with the remaining number of such stockholderÂ’s shares of UGC Common Stock as to which such stockholder has validly made and not validly revoked a Cash Election being converted into and representing the right to receive, and being exchangeable for, the Stock Consideration.   

 3.5 _Exchange of Certificates_.   

 (a) _Deposit of Merger Consideration_.   

 (i) Promptly after the Effective Time, HoldCo shall deposit with the Exchange Agent, for the benefit of the stockholders of LMI and UGC, (A) certificates or, at HoldCoÂ’s option, evidence of shares in book entry form, representing shares of HoldCo Stock in such denominations as the Exchange Agent may reasonably specify and (B) cash, in each case as are issuable or payable, respectively, pursuant to this Article III in respect of shares of UGC Common Stock or shares of LMI Stock, as applicable, for which Certificates or Book-Entry Shares have been properly delivered to the Exchange Agent and cash to be paid in lieu of fractional shares. Such certificates (or evidence of book-entry form, as the case may be) for shares of HoldCo Stock and such cash so deposited, together with any dividends or distributions with respect thereto, are hereinafter referred to as the " _Exchange Fund_ ".   

 (ii) The Exchange Agent shall invest any cash deposited with the Exchange Agent by HoldCo as directed by HoldCo, provided that no such investment or losses thereon shall affect the Cash Consideration payable to holders of shares of UGC    ##### 

  

 

Common Stock entitled to receive such consideration or cash in lieu of
fractional interests, and HoldCo and LMI shall promptly provide additional
funds to the Exchange Agent for the benefit of holders of shares of UGC Common
Stock entitled to receive such consideration in the net amount of any such
losses. Any interest or income produced by such investments shall not be
deemed part of the Exchange Fund and shall be payable to HoldCo or LMI, as
HoldCo directs.

Such letter of transmittal shall be in such form and have such other reasonable provisions as HoldCo may specify.   

 (ii) (x) Each former stockholder of UGC who properly made a Cash Election or Stock Election shall be entitled to receive in exchange for such stockholderÂ’s shares subject to the Cash Election or Stock Election: (A) the number of whole shares of HoldCo Series A Stock, if any, into which such holderÂ’s shares of UGC Common Stock represented by such holderÂ’s properly surrendered Certificates or Book-Entry Shares, as applicable, were converted in accordance with this Article III, and such Certificates or Book-Entry Shares so surrendered shall be forthwith cancelled, and (B) a check in an amount of U.S. dollars (after giving effect to any required withholdings pursuant to Section 3.5(g)) equal to (I) the aggregate amount of cash (including the Cash Consideration plus cash in lieu of fractional interests in shares of HoldCo Series A Stock to be paid pursuant to Section 3.5(d)), if any, into which such holderÂ’s shares of UGC Common Stock represented by such holderÂ’s properly surrendered Certificates or Book-Entry Shares, as applicable, were converted in accordance with this Article III, plus (II) any cash dividends or other distributions that such holder has the right to receive pursuant to Section 3.5(c); and (y) upon surrender by a Deemed Stock Election Holder to the Exchange Agent of a Certificate or Book-Entry Shares, as applicable, together with a letter of transmittal, duly completed and validly executed in accordance with the instructions thereto, and such other documents as may be required pursuant to such    ##### 

  

 

instructions, each Deemed Stock Election Holder shall be entitled to receive
in exchange therefor: (A) the number of whole shares of HoldCo Series
A Stock, if any, into which such holderÂ’s shares of UGC Common Stock
represented by such holderÂ’s properly surrendered Certificates or Book-Entry
Shares, as applicable, were converted in accordance with this Article III,
and such Certificates or Book-Entry Shares so surrendered shall be
forthwith cancelled, and (B) a check in an amount of U.S. dollars (after
giving effect to any required withholdings pursuant to Section 3.5(g)) equal
to (I) the amount of cash in lieu of fractional interests in shares of HoldCo
Series A Stock to be paid pursuant to Section 3.5(d), if any, into which such
holderÂ’s shares of UGC Common Stock represented by such holderÂ’s properly
surrendered Certificates or Book-Entry Shares, as applicable, were converted
in accordance with this Article III, plus (II) any cash dividends or other
distributions that such holder has the right to receive pursuant to Section
3.5(c).    

 (iii) Upon surrender by a Former LMI Holder to the Exchange Agent of a Certificate or Book-Entry Shares, as applicable, together with a letter of transmittal, duly completed and validly executed in accordance with the instructions thereto, and such other documents as may be required pursuant to such instructions, each Former LMI Holder shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor: (A) the number of whole shares of HoldCo Stock into which such holderÂ’s shares of LMI Stock represented by such holderÂ’s properly surrendered Certificates or Book-Entry Shares, as applicable, were converted in accordance with this Article III, and such Certificates or Book-Entry Shares so surrendered shall be forthwith cancelled, and (B) a check in an amount of U.S. dollars (after giving effect to any required withholdings pursuant to Section 3.5(g)) equal to any cash dividends or other distributions that such holder has the right to receive pursuant to Section 3.5(c).   

 (iv) If payment or issuance of the Merger Consideration is to be made to a Person other than the Person in whose name the surrendered Certificate is registered, it shall be a condition of payment or issuance that the Certificate so surrendered shall be properly endorsed or shall be otherwise in proper form for transfer and that the Person requesting such payment or issuance shall have paid to the Exchange Agent any transfer and other taxes required by reason of the payment or issuance of the Merger Consideration to a Person other than the registered holder of the Certificate surrendered or shall have established to the satisfaction of the Exchange Agent that such tax either has been paid or is not applicable. In the event that any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the holderÂ’s compliance with the replacement requirements established by the Exchange Agent, including, if necessary, the posting by the holder of a bond in customary amount as indemnity against any claim that may be made against it with respect to the Certificate, the Exchange Agent shall deliver in exchange for the lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate the applicable Merger Consideration payable in respect of the shares of UGC Common Stock or LMI Stock, as the case may be, represented by the Certificate pursuant to this Article III.    ##### 

  

  

 (v) No interest shall be paid or accrued for the benefit of holders of the Certificates or Book-Entry Shares on the Merger Consideration payable in respect of the Certificates or Book-Entry Shares. Until surrendered as contemplated hereby, each Certificate or Book-Entry Share shall, after the Effective Time, represent for all purposes only the right to receive upon such surrender the applicable Merger Consideration as contemplated by this Article III, the issuance or payment of which (including any cash in lieu of fractional shares) shall be deemed to be the satisfaction in full of all rights pertaining to shares of UGC Common Stock converted in the UGC Merger and shares of LMI Stock converted in the LMI Merger.   

 (vi) At the Effective Time, the stock transfer books of UGC and LMI shall be closed, and thereafter there shall be no further registration of transfers of shares of UGC Common Stock or LMI Stock, respectively, that were outstanding prior to the Effective Time. After the Effective Time, Certificates or Book-Entry Shares presented to UGC or LMI for transfer shall be canceled and exchanged for the consideration provided for, and in accordance with the procedures set forth, in this Article III.   

 (c) _Distributions With Respect to Unexchanged Shares_. No dividends or other distributions with respect to shares of HoldCo Stock issuable with respect to the shares of UGC Common Stock or LMI Stock shall be paid to the holder of any unsurrendered Certificates or Book-Entry Shares until those Certificates or Book-Entry Shares are surrendered as provided in this Article III. Upon surrender, there shall be issued and/or paid to the holder of the shares of HoldCo Stock issued in exchange therefor, without interest, (i) at the time of surrender, the dividends or other distributions payable with respect to those shares of HoldCo Stock with a record date on or after the date of the Effective Time and a payment date on or prior to the date of this surrender and not previously paid and (ii) at the appropriate payment date, the dividends or other distributions payable with respect to those shares of HoldCo Stock with a record date on or after the date of the Effective Time but with a payment date subsequent to surrender.   

 (d) _No Fractional Shares_. No certificates or scrip representing fractional shares of HoldCo Series A Stock shall be issued upon the surrender for exchange of Certificates or Book-Entry Shares evidencing UGC Common Stock, and such fractional share interests will not entitle the owner thereof to vote or to any rights of a stockholder of HoldCo. In lieu thereof, upon surrender of the applicable Certificates or Book-Entry Shares, HoldCo shall pay each holder of UGC Common Stock an amount in cash equal to the product obtained by multiplying (i) the fractional share interest to which such holder (after taking into account all shares of UGC Common Stock held at the Effective Time by such holder that have been converted into the Stock Consideration) would otherwise be entitled, by (ii) the closing price on the Nasdaq for a share of LMI Series A Stock on the last trading day immediately preceding the Effective Time.    ##### 

  

  

 (e) _Termination of Exchange Fund_. Any portion of the Exchange Fund that remains undistributed to the stockholders of UGC and LMI on the first anniversary of the Effective Time shall be delivered to HoldCo, upon demand by HoldCo, and any stockholders of UGC or LMI who have not theretofore complied with this Article III shall thereafter look only to HoldCo for payment of their claim for any part of the Merger Consideration, any cash in lieu of fractional shares of HoldCo Series A Stock and any dividends or distributions with respect to HoldCo Stock.   

 (f) _No Liability_. None of LMI, UGC or HoldCo shall be liable to any holder of shares of UGC Common Stock or LMI Stock for cash or shares of HoldCo Stock (or dividends or distributions with respect thereto) from the Exchange Fund delivered to a public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar law.   

 (g) _Withholding_. HoldCo and the Exchange Agent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the consideration otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement to any holder of shares of UGC Common Stock or shares of LMI Stock such amounts as it is required to deduct and withhold with respect to the making of such payment under the Code and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder, or any provision of state, local or foreign tax law. To the extent that amounts are so withheld by HoldCo or the Exchange Agent, such withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the holder of the shares of UGC Common Stock or shares of LMI Stock in respect of which such deduction and withholding was made by HoldCo or the Exchange Agent.

 (a) _LMI Stock Options_. Each of the then outstanding stock options, if any, to purchase shares of any series of LMI Common Stock (each, a " _LMI Option_ ") issued by LMI pursuant to any LMI Plan, and any non-plan options to acquire shares of any series of LMI Common Stock issued by LMI pursuant to an option agreement or otherwise issued by LMI, will, by virtue of the LMI Merger, and without any further action on the part of any holder thereof, be converted into an option (a " _Converted LMI Option_ ") to purchase a number of shares of the same series of HoldCo Common Stock equal to the number of shares of such series of LMI Common Stock subject to such LMI Option at the Effective Time, at an exercise price per share of the applicable series of HoldCo Common Stock equal to the exercise price per share of such LMI Option immediately prior to the Effective Time. The terms and conditions of each Converted LMI Option will otherwise remain as set forth in the LMI Option converted into such Converted LMI Option. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, the adjustment provided for in this Section 3.6(a) with respect to all options will be and is intended to be effected in a manner that is consistent with Section 424(a) of the Code and, to the extent applicable, QandA-18(d) of Notice 2005-1.    #####

The terms and conditions of each Converted LMI SAR will otherwise remain as set forth in the LMI SAR converted into such Converted LMI SAR. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, the adjustment provided for in this Section 3.6(b) with respect to all stock appreciation rights will be and is intended to be effected in a manner that is consistent with Section 424(a) of the Code and, to the extent applicable, QandA-18(d) of Notice 2005-1.   

 (c) _LMI Restricted Stock_. Each restricted share of LMI Common Stock (" _LMI Restricted Stock_ ") granted pursuant to any LMI Plan and each restricted share of LMI Common Stock issued pursuant to individual awards not granted pursuant to any LMI Plan will, by virtue of the LMI Merger, and without any further action on the part of any holder thereof, be converted into one restricted share of the same series of HoldCo Common Stock, and will remain subject to the same restrictions applicable to such restricted share of LMI Common Stock immediately prior to the Effective Time.   

 3.7 _UGC Stock Options, Stock Appreciation Rights and Restricted Stock_.   

 (a) _UGC Stock Options_. Each of the then outstanding stock options, if any, to purchase shares of UGC Common Stock (each, a " _UGC Option_ ") issued by UGC pursuant to any UGC Plan, and any non-plan options to acquire shares of UGC Common Stock set forth in Section 3.7 of the UGC Disclosure Letter issued by UGC pursuant to an option agreement or otherwise issued by UGC, will, by virtue of the UGC Merger, and without any further action on the part of any holder thereof, be converted into an option (a " _Converted UGC Option_ ") to purchase that number of shares of HoldCo Series A Stock determined by multiplying the number of shares of UGC Common Stock subject to such UGC Option at the Effective Time by the Exchange Ratio, at an exercise price per share of HoldCo Series A Stock equal to the exercise price per share of such UGC Option immediately prior to the Effective Time divided by the Exchange Ratio, rounded up to the nearest whole cent. If the foregoing calculation results in a Converted UGC Option being exercisable for a fraction of a share of HoldCo Series A Stock, then the number of shares of HoldCo Series A Stock subject to such option will be rounded down to the nearest whole number of shares, with no cash being payable for such fractional share. The terms and conditions of each Converted UGC Option will otherwise remain as set    ##### 

  

 

forth in the UGC Option converted into such onverted UGC Option.
Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, the adjustment provided
for in this Section 3.7(a) with respect to all options will be and is
intended to be effected in a manner that is consistent with Section 424(a) of
the Code and, to the extent applicable, QandA-18(d) of Notice 2005-1.

If the foregoing calculation results in a Converted UGC SAR being exercisable with respect to a fraction of a share of HoldCo Series A Stock, then the number of shares of HoldCo Series A Stock in respect of such stock appreciation right will be rounded down to the nearest whole number of shares, with no cash being payable for such fractional share. The terms and conditions of each Converted UGC SAR will otherwise remain as set forth in the UGC SAR converted into such Converted UGC SAR. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, the adjustment provided for in this Section 3.7(b) with respect to all stock appreciation rights will be and is intended to be effected in a manner that is consistent with Section 424(a) of the Code and, to the extent applicable, QandA-18(d) of Notice 2005-1.

 (d) As of the close of business on December 31, 2004, there were no options, warrants or other rights to acquire LMI Series A Stock (or securities convertible into or exercisable or exchangeable for LMI Series A Stock) from LMI, other than (i) the right of the holders of LMI Series B Stock to convert shares of LMI Series B Stock into LMI Series A Stock, pursuant to the LMI Charter, and (ii) options or other rights representing in the aggregate the right to purchase or otherwise acquire up to 1,761,123 shares of LMI Series A Stock (which excludes 1,498,154 options to acquire LMI Series B Stock that can be exercised for LMI Series A Stock, on a one-for-one basis, at the option of the holder) and 3,066,716 shares of LMI Series B Stock (which includes 1,498,154    #####

 6.4 _LMI Reports and Financial Statements_. LMI has filed on a timely basis all forms, reports and documents with the SEC required to be filed by it under the Securities Act or the Exchange Act since June 1, 2004 (collectively, together with the Form 10, dated May 28, 2004, filed by LMI and other than preliminary material, the " _LMI SEC Filings_ "). As of their respective dates, each of the LMI SEC Filings complied in all material respects with the applicable requirements of the Securities Act or the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations thereunder, and none of the LMI SEC Filings contained as of such date any untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading (except that no representation or warranty is made with respect to any information regarding UGC included in the LMI SEC Filings which was furnished by UGC expressly for use therein).

arose as a result of actions by UGC or any of its Subsidiaries.    

 6.5 _No Approvals or Notices Required; No Conflict with Instruments_. The execution and delivery by LMI of this Agreement do not, and the performance by LMI of its obligations hereunder and the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby will not:

 (iii) require on the part of LMI or any Subsidiary of LMI any Contract Consent or Contract Notice to any other Person (other than a Governmental Entity), whether under any License or other Contract or otherwise, except where the failure to obtain such Contract Consent or to give such Contract Notice will not, either individually or in the aggregate, have a LMI Material Adverse Effect or prevent or materially delay the consummation of the Mergers;   

 (iv) result in a Violation of any Contract to which LMI or any Subsidiary of LMI is a party, by which LMI or any Subsidiary of LMI or any of their respective assets or properties is bound or affected or pursuant to which LMI or any Subsidiary of LMI is entitled to any rights or benefits (including any Licenses), except for such Violations which would not, individually or in the aggregate, have a LMI Material Adverse Effect; or   

 (v) assuming adoption of this Agreement at the LMI Special Meeting by the requisite vote of LMIÂ’s stockholders, and assuming that the Government Consents and Governmental Filings specified in clause (ii) of this Section 6.5 are obtained, made and given, result in a Violation of, under or pursuant to any law, rule,    ##### 

  

 

regulation, order, judgment or decree applicable to LMI, any Subsidiary of

 6.7 _Registration Statement; Schedule 13E-3; Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus_. None of the information supplied or to be supplied by LMI in writing specifically for inclusion or incorporation by reference in, and which is included or incorporated by reference in, (i) the Registration Statement or the Schedule 13E-3 or any amendment or supplement thereto will, at the respective times such documents are filed, and, in the case of the Registration Statement or any amendment or supplement thereto, when the same becomes effective, at the time of the Special Meetings or at the Effective Time, contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, or (ii) the Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus or any other documents filed or to be filed with the SEC or any other Governmental Entity in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby, will, at the respective times such documents are filed and, in the case of the Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus or any amendment or     ##### 

 

   

supplement thereto, at the time of mailing to stockholders of UGC and LMI and
at the times of the Special Meetings, be false or misleading with respect to
any material fact, or omit to state any material fact necessary in order to
make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they
were made, not misleading or necessary to correct any statement in any
earlier communication. For this purpose, any such information included or
incorporated by reference in any such document relating to LMI will be deemed
to have been so supplied in writing specifically for inclusion or
incorporation therein if such document was available for review by LMI or its
counsel a reasonable time before such document was filed (but the foregoing
will not be the exclusive manner in which it may be established that such
information was so supplied). The Registration Statement, the Schedule 13E-3

will comply as to form in all material respects with the applicable
requirements of the Securities Act, the Exchange Act and the rules
and regulations promulgated thereunder.

From and after the Effective Time, the LMI Surviving Corporation will indemnify, defend and hold harmless the present and former directors and officers of LMI (when acting in such capacity) and any of its Subsidiaries, and any Person who is or was serving at the request of LMI as a director or officer of another Person (when acting in such capacity) (individually a " _LMI Indemnified Party_ " and, collectively, the " _LMI Indemnified Parties_ ") against all losses, claims, damages, costs, expenses (including fees and expenses of counsel properly retained by a LMI Indemnified Party under this Section 7.5), liabilities or judgments or amounts that are paid in settlement with the approval of the LMI Surviving Corporation (which approval will not be unreasonably withheld or delayed) of or in connection with any claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation based in whole or in part on or arising in whole or in part out of the fact that such Person was at any time prior to the Effective Time a director or officer of LMI, pertaining to any matter existing or occurring at or prior to the Effective Time and whether asserted or claimed prior to, at or after the Effective Time (" _LMI Indemnified Liabilities_ "), to the same extent such persons are indemnified or have the right to advancement of expenses as of the date hereof by LMI pursuant to the LMI Charter and LMIÂ’s Bylaws and indemnification agreements, if any, in existence on the date hereof with any directors, officers and employees of LMI and its Subsidiaries.   

 (c) _Survival of Existing Indemnification Rights_. The parties agree that all rights to indemnification, including provisions relating to advances of expenses incurred in defense of any action, suit or proceeding, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative (each, a " _Claim_ "), existing in favor of the Indemnified Parties as provided in the UGC Charter or UGCÂ’s Bylaws or LMI Charter or LMIÂ’s Bylaws or pursuant to other agreements, or certificates of incorporation or bylaws or    ##### 

  

 

similar documents of any of UGCÂ’s or LMIÂ’s Subsidiaries, as in effect as of
the date hereof, will survive the Mergers and will continue in full force and
effect for a period of not less than six years from the Effective Time;
_provided_ , _however_ , that all rights to indemnification in respect of any
Claim asserted, made or commenced within such period will continue until the
final disposition of such Claim.    

 (d) _Survival_. This Section 7.5 will survive the consummation of the Mergers. The provisions of this Section 7.5 are intended to be for the benefit of and will be enforceable by each of the UGC Indemnified Parties and the LMI Indemnified Parties, and their respective heirs and legal representatives, and will be binding on UGC Surviving Corporation and LMI Surviving Corporation, as applicable, and each of their respective successors and assigns.   

 7.6 _Notification of Certain Matters_. Between the date hereof and the Effective Time, each party will give prompt notice in writing to the other party of: (i) any information that indicates that any of its representations or warranties contained herein was not true and correct in any material respect as of the date hereof or will be untrue and incorrect in any material respect at and as of the Effective Time (except for changes permitted or contemplated by this Agreement), (ii) the occurrence or non-occurrence of any event which will result, or is reasonably likely to result, in the failure of any condition set forth in Article VIII, any covenant or agreement contained in this Agreement to be complied with or satisfied, (iii) any failure of UGC or LMI, as the case may be, to satisfy any condition or comply with, in any material respect, any covenant or agreement to be satisfied or complied with by it hereunder, (iv) any notice or other communication from any third party alleging that the consent of such third party is or may be required in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or that such transactions otherwise may violate the rights of or confer remedies upon such third party and (v) any notice of, or other communication relating to, any litigation referred to in Section 7.7 or any order or judgment entered or rendered therein; _provided_ , _however_ , that the delivery of any notice pursuant to this Section 7.6 will not limit or otherwise affect the remedies available hereunder to the party receiving such notice.   

 7.7 _Defense of Litigation_. Each of the parties agrees to vigorously defend against all actions, suits or proceedings in which such party is named as a defendant which seek to enjoin, restrain or prohibit the transactions contemplated hereby or seek damages with respect to such transactions. No party will settle any such action, suit or proceeding or fail to perfect on a timely basis any right to appeal any judgment rendered or order entered against such party therein without the written consent of the other parties (which consent will not be unreasonably withheld or delayed). Each of the parties further agrees to use commercially reasonable efforts to cause each of its Affiliates, directors and officers to vigorously defend any action, suit or proceeding in which such Affiliate, director or officer is named as a defendant and which seeks any such relief to comply with this Section to the same extent as if such Person were a party hereto.    ##### 

  

  

 7.8 _Actions by LMI_. Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, LMI shall cause shares of UGC Common Stock beneficially owned by it to be voted in favor of the adoption of this Agreement at the UGC Special Meeting.   

 7.9 _Section 16 Matters_. Assuming that UGC and LMI deliver to HoldCo the Section 16 Information (as defined below) reasonably in advance of the Effective Time, the Board of Directors of HoldCo, or a committee of Non-Employee Directors thereof (as such term is defined for purposes of Rule 16b-3(d) under the Exchange Act), shall reasonably promptly thereafter and in any event prior to the Effective Time adopt a resolution providing that the receipt by the Insiders (as defined below) of UGC and LMI of HoldCo Common Stock in exchange for shares of UGC Common Stock or shares of LMI Common Stock, as the case may be, or shares of HoldCo Common Stock upon exercise of stock option or stock appreciation rights or vesting of restricted stock, as the case may be, in each case pursuant to the transactions contemplated hereby and to the extent such securities are listed in the Section 16 Information provided by UGC and LMI to HoldCo prior to the Effective Times, are intended to be exempt from liability pursuant to Section 16(b) under the Exchange Act such that any such receipt shall be so exempt. " _Section 16 Information_" shall mean information accurate in all material respects regarding the Insiders of a Person, the number of shares of the capital stock held by each such Insider, and the number and description of options, stock appreciate rights, restricted shares and other stock-based awards held by each such Insider. " _Insiders_ ", with respect to a Person, shall mean those officers and directors of such Person who are subject to the reporting requirements of Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act and who are listed in the Section 16 Information.   

 7.10 _Tax Treatment of Transactions_. Each of the parties (a) shall use their commercially reasonable efforts to cause the LMI Merger to qualify as a reorganization within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code and, when viewed as a collective whole with the LMI Merger, the conversion of shares of UGC Common Stock into shares of HoldCo Series A Stock that is effected pursuant to the UGC Merger to qualify as an exchange within the meaning of Section 351 of the Code, (b) will not take any action, and will not permit any of its Controlled Affiliates to take any action, that would cause the LMI Merger not to qualify as a reorganization within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code or the conversion of shares of UGC Common Stock into shares of HoldCo Series A Stock that is effected pursuant to the UGC Merger not to qualify as an exchange within the meaning of Section 351 of the Code, and (c) will cooperate with the law firms that are to render the opinions referred to in Sections 8.1(e), 8.2(e) and 8.3(d) by providing appropriate certifications as to factual matters.   

 7.11 _State Takeover Laws_. If any "fair price," "business combination" or "control share acquisition" statute or other similar statute or regulation is or may become applicable to the Mergers, LMI and UGC shall each take such actions as are necessary so that the transactions contemplated by this Agreement may be consummated as promptly    ##### 

  

 

as practicable on the terms contemplated hereby and otherwise act to eliminate
or minimize the effects of any such statute or regulation on
the Mergers.    

 7.12 _Conduct of LMI_. LMI will not declare, make or pay any dividend or distribution on or in respect of its capital stock (other than in shares of LMI Common Stock) or take any action that would reasonably be expected to result in any of the conditions to the Mergers set forth in Article VIII not being fulfilled.

 8.1 _Conditions Precedent to the Obligations of Each Party_. The respective obligations of the parties to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement are subject to the satisfaction at or prior to the Effective Time of each of the following conditions, any or all of which (other than the conditions set forth in Sections 8.1(b) and 8.1(e), which shall be non-waivable), to the extent permitted by applicable law, may be waived by LMI, for itself, HoldCo, LMI Merger Sub and UGC Merger Sub (but not for UGC), or by UGC for itself (with the approval of the Special Committee) (but not for LMI, HoldCo, LMI Merger Sub or UGC Merger Sub):

 (d) _Absence of Injunctions_. No permanent or preliminary Injunction or restraining order or other order by any court or other Governmental Entity of competent jurisdiction, or other legal restraint or prohibition, preventing consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby as provided herein, or permitting such consummation only subject to any condition or restriction that has or would have a UGC Material Adverse Effect or a LMI Material Adverse Effect, will be in effect; and there shall not be any action taken, or any statute, rule, regulation or order (whether temporary, preliminary or permanent) enacted, entered or enforced which makes the consummation of the Mergers illegal or prevents or prohibits the Mergers.    ##### 

  

  

 (e) _Tax Opinion Relating to the Effect of the LMI Merger and the UGC Merger on the Distribution_. LMI and HoldCo shall have received the opinion of Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher and Flom LLP or another nationally recognized law firm reasonably acceptable to UGC (acting with the approval of the Special Committee), dated the Closing Date, to the effect that, for U.S. federal income tax purposes, provided that the Distribution would otherwise have qualified as a tax-free distribution under Section 355 of the Code to LMC and the LMC shareholders, the transactions contemplated by this Agreement should not cause the Distribution to fail to qualify as a tax-free distribution to LMC under Section 355(e) of the Code. In rendering such opinion, Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher and Flom LLP or such other alternate firm may require and rely upon (and may incorporate by reference) representations and covenants made in certificates provided by the parties hereto and upon such other documents and data as Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher and Flom LLP or such other alternate firm deems appropriate as a basis for such opinion.   

 (f) _Governmental Entity Approvals_. All authorizations, consents, orders or approvals of, or declarations or filings with, or expiration of waiting periods imposed by, any Governmental Entity, if any, necessary for the consummation of the Mergers shall have been filed, expired or been obtained, other than those that, individually or in the aggregate, the failure of which to be filed, expired or obtained would not be reasonably likely to have a UGC Material Adverse Effect or a LMI Material Adverse Effect.

 (a) _Accuracy of Representations and Warranties_. All representations and warranties of UGC contained in this Agreement will, if specifically qualified by reference to a UGC Material Adverse Effect, be true and correct and, if not so qualified, be true and correct except where the failure to be so true and correct would not have a UGC Material Adverse Effect, except for the representations and warranties set forth in Section 5.3, which will be true and correct in all material respects, in each case as of the date of this Agreement and (except to the extent such representations and warranties speak as of a specified earlier date) on and as of the Closing Date as though made on and as of the Closing Date, except for changes permitted or contemplated by this Agreement.    #####

 (d) _No Adverse Enactments_. There will not have been any action taken, or any statute, rule, regulation, order, judgment or decree proposed, enacted, promulgated, entered, issued, enforced or deemed applicable by any foreign or United States federal, state or local Governmental Entity that imposes or is reasonably likely to result in imposition of material limitations on the ability of HoldCo effectively to exercise full rights of ownership of shares of capital stock of the Surviving LMI Corporation or the Surviving UGC Corporation (including the right to vote such shares on all matters properly presented to the stockholders of the relevant entity) or makes the holding by HoldCo of any such shares illegal.   

 (e) _Tax Opinion_. LMI shall have received the opinion of Baker Botts L.L.P. or another nationally recognized law firm, dated the Closing Date, to the effect that, for United States federal income tax purposes, (i) the LMI Merger will qualify as a reorganization within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code, (ii) no gain or loss will be recognized by HoldCo, LMI, any Wholly-Owned Subsidiary of LMI that owns shares of UGC Common Stock, or UGC as a result of the LMI Merger or the UGC Merger, and (iii) no gain or loss will be recognized by the shareholders of LMI with respect to shares of LMI Stock converted solely into HoldCo Stock as a result of the LMI Merger. In rendering such opinion, Baker Botts L.L.P. or such alternate firm may require and rely upon (and may incorporate by reference) representations and covenants made in certificates provided by the parties hereto and upon such other documents and data as such counsel deems appropriate as a basis for such opinion.

set forth in Section 6.3, which shall be true and correct in all material
respects, and (ii) the representations and warranties set forth in Section

Agreement and (except to the extent such representations and warranties speak
of a specified earlier date) on and as of the Closing Date as though made on
and as of the Closing Date, except for changes permitted or contemplated
by this Agreement.    

 (b) _Performance of Agreements_. Each of HoldCo and LMI will have performed in all material respects all obligations and agreements, and complied in all material respects with all covenants and conditions, contained in this Agreement to be performed or complied with by it prior to or on the Closing Date.   

 (c) _Officers Â’ Certificates_.

communications will be deemed to have been received on the date of delivery

 10.3 _Entire Agreement_. This Agreement (including the Schedules, Exhibits and other documents delivered in connection herewith) constitutes the entire agreement of the parties and supersedes all prior agreements and understandings, oral and written, between the parties with respect to the subject matter hereof.   

 10.4 _Assignment; Binding Effect; Benefit_. Neither this Agreement nor any of the rights, benefits or obligations hereunder may be assigned by any party (whether by operation of law or otherwise) without the prior written consent of the other parties. Subject to the preceding sentence, this Agreement will be binding upon, inure to the benefit of and be enforceable by the parties and their respective successors and permitted assigns. Nothing in this Agreement, expressed or implied, is intended to confer on, or to make enforceable by, any Person other than the parties or their respective successors and permitted assigns, any rights, remedies, obligations or liabilities under or by reason of this Agreement, other than rights conferred upon persons indemnified under Section 7.5 and upon stockholders, directors, officers, Affiliates, agents and representatives of the parties under Section 10.14. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this    ##### 

  

 

Agreement, the provisions of Section 7.5 of this Agreement may not be amended
or altered in any manner with respect to any person indemnified thereunder
without the written consent of such person. No assignment of this Agreement
will relieve HoldCo, or the Surviving UGC Corporation or the Surviving LMI
Corporation from its obligations to any person indemnified under Section 7.5
of this Agreement.    

 10.5 _Amendment_. Before or after the UGC Stockholder Approval or the LMI Stockholder Approval, this Agreement may be amended by the parties hereto, by action taken or authorized by their respective Boards of Directors and, in the case of UGC, with the approval of the Special Committee, at any time prior to the Effective Time; _provided_ , however, that after the UGC Stockholder Approval or the LMI Stockholder Approval, no amendment may be made without the further requisite approval of such stockholders as contemplated in Section 8.1(a) and Section 8.1(b) if such amendment by law requires the further approval of such stockholders. This Agreement may not be amended except by an instrument in writing signed by the parties hereto.   

 10.6 _Extension; Waiver_. At any time prior to the Effective Time, UGC (with the approval of the Special Committee) or LMI (on behalf of HoldCo, LMI, LMI Merger Sub and UGC Merger Sub), by action taken or authorized by such partyÂ’s Board of Directors, may, to the extent legally allowed, (i) extend the time specified herein for the performance of any of the obligations of the other party, (ii) waive any inaccuracies in the representations and warranties of the other party contained herein or in any document delivered pursuant hereto, (iii) waive compliance by the other party with any of the agreements or covenants of such other party contained herein or (iv) waive any condition to such waiving partyÂ’s obligation to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby or to any of such waiving partyÂ’s other obligations hereunder (other than in the case of the conditions set forth in Sections 8.1(b), 8.1(e), 8.2(e) and 8.3(d), each of which shall be non-waivable). Any such extension or waiver will be valid only if set forth in a written instrument signed by the party or parties to be bound thereby. Any such extension or waiver by any party will be binding on such party but not on the other party entitled to the benefits of the provision of this Agreement affected unless such other party also has agreed to such extension or waiver. No such waiver will constitute a waiver of, or estoppel with respect to, any subsequent or other breach or failure to strictly comply with the provisions of this Agreement. The failure of any party to exercise any of its rights, powers or remedies hereunder or with respect hereto or to insist on strict compliance with this Agreement will not constitute a waiver by such party of its right to exercise any such or other rights, powers or remedies or to demand such compliance. Whenever this Agreement requires or permits consent or approval by any party, such consent or approval will be effective if given in writing in a manner consistent with the requirements for a waiver of compliance as set forth in this Section 10.6.    #####

 10.9 _Applicable Law_. This Agreement and the legal relations between the parties will be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Delaware, without regard to the conflict of laws rules thereof.   

 10.10 _Jurisdiction_. Any suit, action or proceeding seeking to enforce any provision of, or based on any matter arising out of or in connection with, this Agreement, the Mergers or the transactions contemplated hereby will be brought exclusively in the Delaware Chancery Courts, or, if the Delaware Chancery Courts do not have subject matter jurisdiction, in the state courts of the State of Delaware located in Wilmington, Delaware or in the federal courts located in the State of Delaware. Each of the parties hereby consents to personal jurisdiction in any such action, suit or proceeding brought in any such court (and of the appropriate appellate courts therefrom) and irrevocably waives, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, any objection that it may now or hereafter have to the laying of the venue of any such suit, action or proceeding in any such court or that any such suit, action or proceeding brought in any such court has been brought in an inconvenient form. Process in any such suit, action or proceeding may be served on any party anywhere in the world, whether within or without the jurisdiction of any such court. Without limiting the foregoing, each party agrees that service of process on such party as provided in Section 10.2 shall be deemed effective service of process on such party.   

 10.11 _Waiver of Jury Trial_. EACH PARTY ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES THAT ANY CONTROVERSY WHICH MAY ARISE UNDER THIS AGREEMENT IS LIKELY TO INVOLVE COMPLICATED AND DIFFICULT ISSUES, AND THEREFORE EACH SUCH PARTY HEREBY IRREVOCABLY AND UNCONDITIONALLY WAIVES ANY RIGHT SUCH PARTY MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN RESPECT OF ANY LITIGATION DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT, OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED BY THIS AGREEMENT.

10.11.    

 10.12 _Joint Participation in Drafting this Agreement_. The parties acknowledge and confirm that each of their respective attorneys have participated jointly in the drafting, review and revision of this Agreement and that it has not been written solely by counsel for one party and that each party has had the benefit of its independent legal counselÂ’s advice with respect to the terms and provisions hereof and its rights and obligations hereunder. Each party hereto, therefore, stipulates and agrees that the rule of construction to the effect that any ambiguities are to be or may be resolved against the drafting party shall not be employed in the interpretation of this Agreement to favor any party against another and that no party shall have the benefit of any legal presumption or the detriment of any burden of proof by reason of any ambiguity or uncertain meaning contained in this Agreement.   

 10.13 _Enforcement of this Agreement_. The parties hereto agree that irreparable damage would occur in the event that any of the provisions of this Agreement were not performed in accordance with their specific terms or were otherwise breached. It is accordingly agreed that the parties will be entitled to an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions hereof, this being in addition to any other remedy to which they are entitled at law or in equity.   

 10.14 _Limited Liability_. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, no stockholder, director, officer, Affiliate, agent or representative of any party (other than LMI as the sole stockholder of HoldCo) will have any liability in respect of or relating to the covenants, obligations, representations or warranties of such party hereunder or in respect of any certificate delivered with respect thereto and, to the fullest extent legally permissible, each party, for itself and its stockholders, directors, officers and Affiliates, waives and agrees not to seek to assert or enforce any such liability which any such Person otherwise might have pursuant to applicable law.   

 10.15 _Severability_. If any term or other provision of this Agreement is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced by any rule of law or public policy, all other conditions and provisions of this Agreement will nevertheless remain in full force and effect so long as the economic or legal substance of the transactions contemplated hereby is not affected in any manner materially adverse to any party. Upon such determination that any term or other provision is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced, the parties hereto will negotiate in good faith to modify this Agreement so as to effect the original intent of the parties as closely as possible to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law in an acceptable manner to the end that the transactions contemplated hereby are fulfilled to the extent possible.
