the Code continues to satisfy the requirements for such qualification.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)&nbsp;Each UGC Plan has been maintained and administered in compliance with its terms and with
ERISA and the Code to the extent applicable thereto, except for such non-compliance which
individually or in the aggregate would not have a UGC Material Adverse Effect.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c)&nbsp;There has been no event or circumstance that has resulted in any material liability being
asserted by any UGC Plan, the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation or any other Person or entity
under Title IV of ERISA or Section&nbsp;412 of the Code against UGC or any UGC ERISA Affiliate and there
has not been any event or circumstance that could reasonably be expected to result in any liability
which individually or in the aggregate would have a UGC Material Adverse Effect.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(d)&nbsp;There is no contract, agreement, plan or arrangement to which UGC or any of its
Subsidiaries is a party covering any employee, former employee, officer, director, shareholder or
contract worker of UGC or any of its Subsidiaries, which, individually or collectively, could give
rise to the payment of any amount that would not be deductible pursuant to Section&nbsp;280G of the Code
solely as a result of the transactions contemplated hereby.

Agreement, the Mergers and the other transactions contemplated hereby based upon arrangements made
by or on behalf of UGC other than Morgan Stanley &#038; Co. Incorporated (&#147;<U>Morgan Stanley</U>&#148;).

shares of UGC Class&nbsp;A Stock (other than LMI or its Affiliates) as contemplated by Section&nbsp;3.3(b)
for the conversion of UGC Common Stock into HoldCo Series&nbsp;A Stock and/or cash pursuant to the UGC
Merger is fair as of the date of the opinion, from a financial point of view, to such holders
(other than LMI or its Affiliates) (the &#147;<U>UGC Fairness Opinion</U>&#148;). A true and complete copy
of the UGC Fairness Opinion (which includes a consent to the inclusion in its entirety of a copy of
the UGC Fairness Opinion in any documents required to be filed by UGC with the SEC with respect to
the Mergers, which consent has not been withdrawn) has been delivered to LMI.

Merger Sub is a corporation, partnership, limited liability company or other business association
duly organized, validly existing and in good standing under the laws of the jurisdiction of its
incorporation or organization. LMI and each Significant LMI Subsidiary has all requisite
corporate, partnership, limited liability company or other business association power and authority
to own, lease and operate its properties and to carry on its business as it is now being conducted,
except where such failure, individually or in the aggregate, has not had and would not reasonably
be expected to have a LMI Material Adverse Effect. LMI and each Significant LMI Subsidiary is duly
qualified or licensed and in good standing to do business in each jurisdiction in which the
property owned, leased or operated by it or the nature of the business conducted by it makes such
qualification or license necessary, except in such jurisdictions where the failure to be so duly
qualified or licensed or in good standing has not had and would not reasonably be expected to have,
individually or in the aggregate, a LMI Material Adverse Effect. A &#147;<U>Significant LMI
Subsidiary</U>&#148; means any Subsidiary of LMI that constitutes a significant subsidiary within the
meaning of Rule&nbsp;1-02 of Regulation&nbsp;S-X of the SEC.

<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(e)&nbsp;The LMI Board has adopted a resolution stating that the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement do not constitute a change of control or any comparable event which would permit or

by LMI and other than preliminary material, the &#147;<U>LMI SEC Filings</U>&#148;). As of their respective

requirements of the Securities Act or the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations thereunder, and none of the
LMI SEC Filings contained as of such date any untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to

light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading (except that no

with GAAP applied on a consistent basis (except as may be indicated therein or in the schedules
thereto), and such financial statements fairly present, in all material respects, the consolidated
financial position of LMI and its consolidated Subsidiaries as of the respective dates thereof and
the consolidated results of their operations and their consolidated cash flows for the respective
periods then ended, subject, in the case of the unaudited interim financial statements, to normal,
recurring year-end audit adjustments. Except as disclosed in the LMI SEC Filings filed with the
SEC and publicly available prior to the date hereof, from September&nbsp;30, 2004 to the date of this
Agreement, LMI and its Subsidiaries have not incurred any liabilities that are of a nature that

thereto prepared in conformity with GAAP, other than (a)&nbsp;liabilities incurred in the ordinary
course of business, (b)&nbsp;liabilities for Taxes or (c)&nbsp;liabilities that, individually or in the

Distribution</U>. LMI and HoldCo shall have received the opinion of Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher
&#038; Flom LLP or another nationally recognized law firm reasonably acceptable to UGC (acting with the
approval of the Special Committee), dated the Closing Date, to the effect that, for U.S. federal
income tax purposes, provided that the Distribution would otherwise have qualified as a tax-free
distribution under Section&nbsp;355 of the Code to LMC and the LMC shareholders, the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement should not cause the Distribution to fail to qualify as a tax-free
distribution to LMC under Section 355(e) of the Code. In rendering such opinion, Skadden, Arps,
Slate, Meagher &#038; Flom LLP or such other alternate firm may require and rely upon (and may
incorporate by reference) representations and covenants made in certificates provided by the
parties hereto and upon such other documents and data as Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher &#038; Flom LLP

Entity, if any, necessary for the consummation of the Mergers shall have been filed, expired or

Adverse Effect, be true and correct and, if not so qualified, be true and correct except where the
failure to be so true and correct would not have a UGC Material Adverse Effect, except for the

conversion of shares of UGC Common Stock into shares of HoldCo Series&nbsp;A Stock that is effected
pursuant to the UGC Merger will qualify as an exchange within the meaning of Section&nbsp;351 of the

(other than in the case of the conditions set forth in Sections&nbsp;8.1(b), 8.1(e), 8.2(e) and 8.3(d),
each of which shall be non-waivable). Any such extension or waiver will be valid only if set forth
in a written instrument signed by the party or parties to be bound thereby. Any such extension or
waiver by any party will be binding on such party but not on the other party entitled to the
benefits of the provision of this Agreement affected unless such other party also has agreed to
such extension or waiver. No such waiver will constitute a waiver of, or estoppel with respect to,
any subsequent or other breach or failure to strictly comply with the provisions of this Agreement.
The failure of any party to exercise any of its rights, powers or remedies hereunder or with
respect hereto or to insist on strict compliance with this Agreement will not constitute a waiver
by such party of its right to exercise any such or other rights, powers or remedies or to demand
such compliance. Whenever this Agreement requires or permits consent or approval by any party, such
consent or approval will be effective if given in writing in a manner consistent with the
requirements for a waiver of compliance as set forth in this Section&nbsp;10.6.

<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;10.9 <U>Applicable Law</U>. This Agreement and the legal relations between the parties will be
governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Delaware, without regard to
the conflict of laws rules thereof.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;10.10 <U>Jurisdiction</U>. Any suit, action or proceeding seeking to enforce any provision of, or
based on any matter arising out of or in connection with, this Agreement, the Mergers or the
transactions contemplated hereby will be brought exclusively in the Delaware Chancery Courts, or,
if the Delaware Chancery Courts do not have subject matter jurisdiction, in the state courts of the State of Delaware located in Wilmington, Delaware or in the federal courts

courts therefrom) and irrevocably waives, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, any
objection that it may now or hereafter have to the laying of the venue of any such suit, action or
proceeding in any such court or that any such suit, action or proceeding brought in any such court
has been brought in an inconvenient form. Process in any such suit, action or proceeding may be
served on any party anywhere in the world, whether within or without the jurisdiction of any such
court. Without limiting the foregoing, each party agrees that service of process on such party as
provided in Section&nbsp;10.2 shall be deemed effective service of process on such party.

THIS AGREEMENT, OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED BY THIS AGREEMENT. EACH PARTY CERTIFIES AND
ACKNOWLEDGES THAT (i)&nbsp;NO REPRESENTATIVE, AGENT OR ATTORNEY OF ANY OTHER PARTY HAS REPRESENTED,
EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE, THAT SUCH OTHER PARTY WOULD NOT, IN THE EVENT OF LITIGATION, SEEK TO
ENFORCE THE FOREGOING WAIVER, (ii)&nbsp;EACH PARTY UNDERSTANDS AND HAS CONSIDERED THE IMPLICATIONS OF

<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE MUTUAL WAIVERS AND CERTIFICATIONS IN THIS
SECTION 10.11.



<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;10.12 <U>Joint Participation in Drafting this Agreement</U>. The parties acknowledge and confirm
that each of their respective attorneys have participated jointly in the drafting, review and
revision of this Agreement and that it has not been written solely by counsel for one party and
that each party has had the benefit of its independent legal counsel&#146;s advice with respect to the
terms and provisions hereof and its rights and obligations hereunder. Each party hereto, therefore,
stipulates and agrees that the rule of construction to the effect that any ambiguities are to be or
may be resolved against the drafting party shall not be employed in the interpretation of this
Agreement to favor any party against another and that no party shall have the benefit of any legal
presumption or the detriment of any burden of proof by reason of any ambiguity or uncertain meaning
contained in this Agreement.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;10.13 <U>Enforcement of this Agreement</U>. The parties hereto agree that irreparable damage
would occur in the event that any of the provisions of this Agreement were not performed in
accordance with their specific terms or were otherwise breached. It is accordingly agreed that the
parties will be entitled to an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement and
to enforce specifically the terms and provisions hereof, this being in addition to any other remedy
to which they are entitled at law or in equity.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;10.14 <U>Limited Liability</U>. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, no
stockholder, director, officer, Affiliate, agent or representative of any party (other than LMI as
the sole stockholder of HoldCo) will have any liability in respect of or relating to the covenants,
obligations, representations or warranties of such party hereunder or in respect of any certificate
delivered with respect thereto and, to the fullest extent legally permissible, each party, for
itself and its stockholders, directors, officers and Affiliates, waives and agrees not to seek to
assert or enforce any such liability which any such Person otherwise might have pursuant to
applicable law.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;10.15 <U>Severability</U>. If any term or other provision of this Agreement is invalid, illegal
or incapable of being enforced by any rule of law or public policy, all other conditions and
provisions of this Agreement will nevertheless remain in full force and effect so long as the
economic or legal substance of the transactions contemplated hereby is not affected in any manner
materially adverse to any party. Upon such determination that any term or other provision is
invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced, the parties hereto will negotiate in good faith to
modify this Agreement so as to effect the original intent of the parties as closely as possible to
the fullest extent permitted by applicable law in an acceptable manner to the end that the
transactions contemplated hereby are fulfilled to the extent possible.
