determining to enter into this Agreement or consummating the transactions contemplated by this

such Seller in connection therewith, in each case other than the LNE Representations. Each of the
Sellers acknowledges that such Seller has, independently and without reliance upon any

such documents and information as such Seller, as applicable, has deemed appropriate, made its own
appraisal of and investigation into the business, operations, property, financial and other
condition, investment merits and consequences of its sale or purchase, as applicable, of the FLMG
Common Stock and the LNE Common Stock and made its own decision with respect to its sale or
purchase, as applicable, of the FLMG Common Stock and the LNE Common Stock. Each of the Sellers
represents that it has consulted to the extent deemed appropriate by it with its own advisers as to
the financial, tax, legal and related matters concerning a sale or purchase, as applicable, of the

and related consequences of a sale or purchase, as applicable, of the FLMG Common Stock and the LNE
Common Stock, and believes that a sale or purchase, as applicable, of the FLMG Common Stock and the
LNE Common Stock is suitable and appropriate for it. Each of the Sellers acknowledges that,
subject to <U>Section&nbsp;4.6</U>, LNE and the LNE Affiliates have or may have confidential
information relating to LNE and its Subsidiaries and FLMG and its investments that has not been
disclosed to such Seller, and that notwithstanding such non-disclosure such Seller has received

Stock.

<U>however</U>, that in no event shall LNE or FLMG be required to expend for such policies
pursuant to this sentence an annual premium amount in excess of 300% of the amount per annum FLMG

<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 8%">In connection with, and as a condition to, the issuance of any LNE Common Stock to a Seller,
each of (a)&nbsp;the Azoff Sellers, jointly and severally, with respect to ILA and the Azoff Trust (and
not MSG or MSG Sub); and (b)&nbsp;MSG (which shall be deemed to be a Seller for purposes of this
<U>Section&nbsp;5.6</U>) and MSG Sub, jointly and severally, with respect to MSG and MSG Sub (and not
ILA or the Azoff Trust) agree as follows:

&#147;accredited investor&#148; as that term is defined in Rule&nbsp;501 of Regulation&nbsp;D under the Securities Act.

under the Securities Act and registered or qualified, if required, under the securities laws of the
states or other jurisdictions in which it is to be sold, or unless (i)&nbsp;such sale or other
distribution may be effected pursuant to the exemption from registration under the Securities Act,
including the exemption provided by Rule&nbsp;144 thereunder, or (ii)&nbsp;Seller delivers to Parent (x)&nbsp;a
no-action letter from the SEC and the appropriate state or other jurisdiction&#146;s securities
officials as to such proposed sale or sales or (y)&nbsp;an opinion of counsel, which opinion and which
counsel shall be reasonably satisfactory to Parent, to the effect that registration of the LNE
Common Stock is not required under the Securities Act and any such state&#146;s or other jurisdiction&#146;s
laws in connection with the proposed sale and distribution.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 8%">(e)&nbsp;Seller understands and agrees that the certificates for LNE Common Stock received by it
will be legended substantially as follows until such time that such LNE Common Stock is transferred
pursuant to an effective registration statement or in accordance with an exemption from the
registration requirements of the Securities Act, or until such time as LNE may notify the transfer
agent for such LNE Common Stock that the legend shall be removed:

the Acquired Shares, and promptly upon the request of any Seller, LNE shall register or qualify

necessity of any filing thereunder), (ii)&nbsp;there are no Registrable Shares beneficially owned by
Sellers or (iii)&nbsp;the first anniversary of the effective date of such registration statement. If a
Seller desires to sell Registrable Shares after the first anniversary of the effective date of such
registration statement but is prevented from doing so because of limitations under Rule&nbsp;144 of the
Securities Act on the volume or method of transfer applicable to the sale of such Registrable
Shares, then upon written request of such Seller, LNE will use commercially reasonable efforts to
re-register or maintain the effective registration of such Registrable Shares as set forth above

such Registrable Shares).

under the Securities Act or otherwise, arising out of or based upon any untrue statement or alleged
untrue statement of a material fact required to be stated or necessary to make the statements not
misleading in any such registration statement (including any document incorporated by reference
therein), except to the extent that such Loss is caused by any such untrue statement or alleged
untrue statement based upon information relating to such Seller that is supplied by such Seller for
inclusion in such registration statement (including any prospectus related thereto).


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 8%">(e)&nbsp;Each of (a)&nbsp;the Azoff Sellers, jointly and severally, with respect to ILA and the Azoff

Securities Act or otherwise, arising out of or based upon any untrue statement or alleged untrue
statement of a material fact required to be stated or necessary to make the statements not
misleading in any such registration statement (including any document incorporated by reference

related thereto).


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 8%">(f)&nbsp;Upon the filing of the registration statement referred to in <U>Section&nbsp;5.7(a)</U>, LNE
shall notify the transfer agent for the Sellers&#146; LNE Common Stock that the restrictive legend
described in Section&nbsp;5.6(e) shall be removed from the Sellers&#146; LNE Common Stock. Promptly (but in
no case later than three (3)&nbsp;Business Days) following a transfer of Registrable Shares by MSG Sub,
MSG Sub shall notify LNE whether such transfer was made pursuant to an effective registration
statement or in accordance with an exemption from the registration requirements of the Securities
Act.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 8%">(g)&nbsp;LNE shall prepare and file in a timely manner, information, documents and reports in
compliance with the Exchange Act so as to comply with the requirements of such Act and the rules
and regulations thereunder. If at any time LNE is not required to file reports in compliance with

promptly, upon the written request of a Seller, make available adequate current public information

purposes of calculating Losses of Purchaser Indemnitees in respect of a claim for indemnification
pursuant to this <U>Section&nbsp;6.1</U> (and not for purposes of determining whether or not any such

<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 8%">6.3 <U>Procedures Relating to Indemnification</U>.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 8%">(a)&nbsp;In order for any indemnified party (&#147;<U>Indemnified Party</U>&#148;) specified in <U>Section
6.1</U> or <U>6.2</U>, as applicable, to be entitled to any indemnification provided for under
<U>Section&nbsp;6.1</U> or <U>6.2</U>, respectively, arising out of or resulting from any claim made
by any Person other than the parties hereto or any of their Affiliates against the Indemnified
Party (each, a &#147;<U>Third Party Claim</U>&#148;), such Indemnified Party must notify the indemnifying
party (the &#147;<U>Indemnifying Party</U>&#148;) in writing, and in reasonable detail, of the Third Party
Claim promptly after receipt by such Indemnified Party of written notice of the Third Party Claim;
<U>provided</U>, <U>however</U>, that failure to give such notification shall not affect the
indemnification provided hereunder except to the extent the Indemnifying Party shall have been
materially and actually prejudiced as a result of such failure. Thereafter, the Indemnified Party
shall deliver to the Indemnifying Party, within five Business Days after the Indemnified Party&#146;s
receipt thereof, copies of all notices and documents (including court papers) received by the
Indemnified Party relating to the Third Party Claim.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 8%">(b)&nbsp;If a Third Party Claim is made against an Indemnified Party, the Indemnifying Party shall
be entitled to participate in the defense thereof and, if it so chooses and acknowledges its
obligation to indemnify the Indemnified Party therefor, to assume the defense thereof with counsel
selected by the Indemnifying Party; <U>provided</U> that such counsel is not reasonably objected
to by the Indemnified Party. Should the Indemnifying Party so elect to assume the defense of a
Third Party Claim, the Indemnifying Party shall not be liable to the Indemnified Party for legal
expenses subsequently incurred by the Indemnified Party in connection with the defense thereof
(except in the case of a conflict of interest, as described below). If the Indemnifying Party
assumes such defense, the Indemnified Party shall have the right to participate in the defense
thereof and to employ counsel, at its own expense, separate from the counsel employed by the
Indemnifying Party, it being understood that the Indemnifying Party shall control such defense
(except that if, in the reasonable judgment of an Indemnified Party, a conflict of interest exists
between the Indemnifying Party and the Indemnified Party, the Indemnified Party may employ its own
counsel, separate from the counsel employed by the Indemnifying Party, and may control its defense
to the extent deemed necessary by the Indemnified Party). The Indemnifying Party shall be liable,
in respect of any Third Party Claim, for the fees and expenses of one counsel for all the
Indemnified Parties for any period during which the Indemnifying Party is not assuming the defense
thereof or during a conflict of interest (as described above).


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 8%">(c)&nbsp;If the Indemnifying Party so elects to assume the defense of any Third Party Claim, all of
the Indemnified Parties shall cooperate with the Indemnifying Party in the defense or prosecution
thereof. In any event, the Indemnified Party and its counsel shall cooperate with the Indemnifying
Party and its counsel and, except to the extent related to any conflict of interest, shall not
assert any position in any proceeding inconsistent with that asserted by the Indemnifying Party;
<U>provided</U>, <U>however</U>, that the foregoing shall not prevent the Indemnified Party from
taking the position that it is entitled to indemnification hereunder. All out-of-pocket costs and
expenses incurred in connection with an Indemnified Party&#146;s cooperation shall be borne by the
Indemnifying Party. Such cooperation shall include the retention and (upon the Indemnifying
Party&#146;s request) the provision to the Indemnifying Party of records and information which are
reasonably relevant to such Third Party Claim, and making employees available on a mutually
convenient basis to provide additional information and explanation of any material provided
hereunder. Whether or not the Indemnifying Party shall have assumed the defense of a Third Party
Claim, the Indemnified Party shall not be entitled to any indemnification hereunder with respect to
any admission of any liability or any settlement, compromise or discharge of any Third Party Claim
effected without the Indemnifying Party&#146;s prior written consent (which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld). If the Indemnifying Party shall have assumed the defense of a Third Party
Claim, the Indemnified Party shall agree to any settlement, compromise or discharge of such Third
Party Claim which: (i)&nbsp;the Indemnifying Party may recommend; (ii)&nbsp;by its terms obligates the
Indemnifying Party to pay the full amount of the liability in connection with such Third Party
Claim; (iii)&nbsp;releases the Indemnified Party completely from and in connection with such Third Party
Claim; and (iv)&nbsp;would not otherwise adversely affect the Indemnified Party or require any relief
other than monetary damages.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 8%">(d)&nbsp;Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Indemnifying Party shall not be entitled to assume the
defense of any Third Party Claim (and shall be liable for the fees and expenses of counsel incurred
by the Indemnified Party in defending such Third Party Claim) if the Third Party Claim seeks an
order, injunction or other equitable relief or relief for other than money damages against the
Indemnified Party. The indemnification required by <U>Sections&nbsp;6.1</U> and <U>6.2</U> shall be
made by periodic payments of the amount thereof during the course of the investigation or defense,
as and when bills are received or Losses are incurred. All claims under <U>Sections&nbsp;6.1</U> and
<U>6.2</U> that are Third Party Claims shall be governed by <U>Section&nbsp;6.3</U>.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 8%">(e)&nbsp;The indemnification provisions of this <U>ARTICLE VI</U> (i)&nbsp;shall apply without regard
to, and shall not be subject to, any limitation by reason of set-off, limitation or otherwise and
(ii)&nbsp;are intended to be comprehensive and not to be limited by any Requirements of Law concerning
prominence of language or waiver of any legal right under any law. The obligations of the parties
set forth in this <U>ARTICLE&nbsp;VI</U> shall be conditioned upon the Closing having occurred.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 8%">6.4 <U>Other Claims</U>. If any Indemnified Party should have a claim against any
Indemnifying Party under <U>Section&nbsp;6.1</U> or <U>6.2</U>, as applicable, that does not involve a
Third Party Claim being asserted against or sought to be collected from such Indemnified Party, the
Indemnified Party shall deliver notice of such claim with reasonable promptness to the Indemnifying
Party. The failure by any Indemnified Party so to notify the Indemnifying Party shall not relieve
the Indemnifying Party from any liability which it may have to such Indemnified Party under
<U>Section&nbsp;6.1</U> or <U>6.2</U>, as applicable, except to the extent that the Indemnifying Party
demonstrates that it has been materially and actually prejudiced as a result of such failure. If
the Indemnifying Party does not notify the Indemnified Party within 30&nbsp;days following its receipt
of such notice that the Indemnifying Party disputes its liability to the Indemnified Party under
<U>Section&nbsp;6.1</U> or <U>6.2</U>, as applicable, such claim specified by the Indemnified Party in
such notice shall be conclusively deemed a liability of the Indemnifying Party under <U>Section
6.1</U> or <U>6.2</U>, as applicable, and the Indemnifying Party shall pay the amount of such
liability to the Indemnified Party on demand or, in the case of any notice in which the amount of
the Losses (or any portion thereof) is estimated, on such later date when the amount of such Losses
(or such portion thereof) becomes finally determined. If the Indemnifying Party disputes its
liability with respect to such claim within such 30&nbsp;day period, the Indemnifying Party and the
Indemnified Party shall resolve such dispute as follows: (i)&nbsp;first, the parties shall negotiate in
good faith to resolve such dispute for a period of up to 21&nbsp;days, then (ii)&nbsp;if the Indemnifying
Party and the Indemnified Party are unable to reach an agreement, such dispute shall be resolved in
accordance with <U>Section&nbsp;8.8</U>.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 8%">6.5 <U>Limit on Indemnification</U>. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in
this Agreement, the maximum amount of the obligations of each Seller under <U>Section&nbsp;6.1</U> and
LNE and Holdings&#146; obligation under <U>Section&nbsp;6.2</U> in the aggregate shall, in each case, be an
amount equal to the product of the Acquired Share Price multiplied by the number of Acquired Shares
exchanged or sold by such Seller, <U>provided</U> that this <U>Section&nbsp;6.5</U> shall not operate
to limit the liability of any party under <U>ARTICLE VII</U>. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary in this Agreement, MSG and MSG Sub shall be deemed to a single Seller for purposes of this
<U>Section&nbsp;6.5</U>.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt">6.6 <U>Exclusive Remedy</U>. Other than in the case of fraud, the right of the Indemnified
Parties to assert claims for indemnification and to receive indemnification pursuant to this
<U>ARTICLE&nbsp;VI</U> shall, after the Closing, be the Indemnified Parties&#146; sole and exclusive remedy
for the matters described in <U>Sections&nbsp;6.1</U>, <U>6.2</U> and <U>6.3</U>.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 8%">6.7 <U>Tax Treatment; Gross Up Provisions</U>.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 8%">(a)&nbsp;Except to the extent otherwise required pursuant to a Determination or a change in
Requirements of Law, the parties agree to treat any indemnity payment made under <U>Section
6.1</U> or <U>6.2</U> as an adjustment to the consideration paid by LNE in connection with the
purchase of the Acquired Shares for all federal, state, local and foreign tax purposes.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 8%">(b)&nbsp;In connection with the transfer of the ILA Shares pursuant to <U>Section&nbsp;2.1(a)</U> and
the payment to the Azoff Trust of its portion of the Stub Amount pursuant to <U>Section
2.5(b)(ii)</U>, ILA shall be entitled to receive on the Closing Date $12,571,984.29. Such &#147;gross
up&#148; payment will be made, at LNE&#146;s option, in cash or in shares of LNE Common Stock based on the
LNE Closing Price, and shall satisfy any remaining obligations of FLMG under the Restricted Stock
Award Agreement, dated as of June&nbsp;8, 2007, between FLMG and ILA.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 8%">6.8 <U>No Special Damages</U>. In no event shall any Indemnifying Party be liable to any
Indemnified Party for any consequential, indirect, incidental or other similar damages, including
lost profits, lost revenues, business interruption, cost of capital or loss of business reputation
or opportunity, or punitive or special damages for any breach or default under, or any act or
omission arising out of or in any way relating to, this Agreement or the transactions contemplated
hereby (other than indemnification for amounts paid or payable to third parties in respect of any
Third Party Claim for which indemnification hereunder is otherwise required).

Subsidiaries except on behalf of LYV, or (ii)&nbsp;take away or interfere or attempt to interfere with
any custom, trade, business or patronage of FLMG or any of its Subsidiaries, or (iii)&nbsp;induce or
attempt to induce any Person under a written or oral agreement to violate the terms of their
contracts or employment arrangements with LYV, or (iv)&nbsp;induce or attempt to induce any Person to
leave the employ of FLMG or any of its Subsidiaries, or (v)&nbsp;engage in any similar activity that is
competitive with LYV or any of its businesses (including FLMG) with respect to the Music Business.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 8%">7.4 <U>Limits on Non-Solicitation</U>. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Azoff Sellers are
not precluded from soliciting any former employee of LYV or its Affiliates who (x)&nbsp;responds to any
public advertisement or general solicitation; (y)&nbsp;has been terminated by LYV prior to the
solicitation; or (z)&nbsp;was such Azoff Seller&#146;s personal assistant or secretary. This <U>Section
7.4</U> does not apply to any Artist or Business Partner. In addition, ILA&#146;s investment in TBA
Global Events LLC shall not be deemed a violation of <U>Sections&nbsp;7.2 and 7.3</U> so long as it
does not materially interfere with the performance of his duties hereunder and the Azoff Sellers
may solicit Business Partners during the Exclusivity Period with respect to transactions or matters
that are not prohibited by <U>Sections&nbsp;7.2 and 7.3</U> (e.g., charitable endeavors) without being
in violation of <U>Section&nbsp;7.2(b)</U> above.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 8%">7.5 <U>Tolling of Exclusivity Period</U>. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this
Agreement, the Exclusivity Period with respect to the Azoff Sellers shall be extended by the length
of any period during which any Azoff Seller is in breach of the terms of this <U>ARTICLE VII</U>.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 8%">7.6 <U>Specific Performance</U>. The Azoff Sellers acknowledge and agree that LYV&#146;s remedies
at law for a breach or threatened breach of any of the provisions of this <U>ARTICLE VII</U> would
be inadequate, impracticable and extremely difficult to prove, and LYV would suffer irreparable
damages as a result of such breach or threatened breach. In recognition of this fact, the Azoff
Sellers agree that, in the event of such a breach or threatened breach, in addition to any remedies
at law, LYV, without posting any bond, shall be entitled to obtain equitable relief in the form of
specific performance, temporary restraining order, temporary or permanent injunction or any other
equitable remedy which may then be available.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 8%">7.7 <U>Geographic Coverage and Sale of Business; Term</U>. The covenants contained in this
<U>ARTICLE VII</U> constitute a series of separate covenants, one for each of those counties and
states in the United States and each of the those foreign countries or jurisdictions referred to in
<U>ARTICLE VII</U>. Except for geographic coverage, each such separate covenant contained in
<U>ARTICLE VII</U> hereof shall be deemed identical in terms. The Azoff Sellers agree (i)&nbsp;the
covenants contained herein are reasonable under the circumstances (e.g., in connection with the
disposition of the Azoff Sellers&#146; entire equity interest in FLMG at the Azoff Sellers&#146; request
prior to the time that the Azoff Sellers would have been entitled to put them to LYV), (ii)&nbsp;the
Azoff Sellers have consulted with counsel of their choosing, and based upon such counsel&#146;s advice,
the covenants contained herein constitute a valid and enforceable agreement under Section&nbsp;16601 of
the California Business and Professional Code because the Azoff Sellers are selling the remaining
ownership interest in FLMG within their control and/or the Azoff Sellers are selling the goodwill
they created in FLMG, and (iii)&nbsp;the Azoff Sellers will not contest the validity or unenforceability
of this <U>ARTICLE VII</U> during the Exclusivity Period. The term of the Exclusivity Period was
determined by the parties to be reasonable based on the nature of the Music Business and duration
of the underlying non-compete agreement which this <U>ARTICLE VII</U> supersedes.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 8%">7.8 <U>Severability</U>. If a final judicial determination is made by a court of competent
jurisdiction that the time or territory or any other restriction in that regard is an unenforceable
restriction against the Azoff Sellers, the provisions of this Agreement shall not be rendered void
but shall be deemed amended to apply as to such maximum time and territory and to such maximum
extent as such court may judicially determine or indicate to be enforceable. Alternatively, if any
court of competent jurisdiction finds that any such restriction incorporated by reference in this
Agreement is unenforceable, and such restriction cannot be amended so as to make it enforceable,
such finding shall not prejudice or in any way affect the validity or enforceability of any other
paragraph, clause, sub-clause or provision. This Agreement and each paragraph, clause, sub-clause
and provision hereof shall be read and construed so as to give thereto the full effect thereof
subject only to any contrary provision of law to the extent that when this <U>ARTICLE VII</U> or
any paragraph, clause, sub-clause or provision hereof would, but for the provisions of this
<U>ARTICLE VII</U>, have been read and construed as being void and ineffective, it shall
nevertheless be a valid agreement, covenant, paragraph, clause, sub-clause or provision as the case
may be to the full extent to which it is not contrary to any provision at law.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 8%">7.9 <U>Passive Investment</U>. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary stated in this
<U>ARTICLE VII</U>, it is agreed by the parties to this Agreement that nothing in this Agreement
shall limit the Azoff Sellers&#146; right to continue to own, as a passive investor, and not as an
officer, director, representative, consultant or otherwise, any other Excluded Businesses.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 8%">7.10 <U>FLMG Conflict of Interest</U>. In light of the fact LYV frequently enters into
agreements with (i)&nbsp;Artists, (ii)&nbsp;other entertainment and/or media clients of FLMG (as FLMG&#146;s
business is currently conducted) (including any Person that renders creative services or conducts
activities in the entertainment and/or media industries), or (iii)&nbsp;clients of FLMG other than those
falling under clauses (i)&nbsp;or (ii) (as approved by the then CEO of LNE within his scope of
authority), each party to this Agreement acknowledges that it is the intent of the parties that, in
any situation in which the interests of FLMG and/or any of its Artists or other clients (as
described in clauses (ii) &#150; (iii)) are or may be adverse to the interests of LYV, the Azoff Sellers
(while employed by FLMG) are to act solely in the interests of FLMG and such Artists or other
clients of FLMG, and that the Azoff Sellers have no duty whatsoever to act in the interests of LYV.
The Azoff Sellers and FLMG hereby amend the ILA Front Line Employment Agreement by deleting
Section 12(i) and replacing it with the provisions contained in this <U>Section&nbsp;7.10</U>.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 8%">7.11 <U>Survival</U>. The provisions of this <U>ARTICLE VII</U> with respect to the Azoff
Sellers shall survive the termination of the Azoff Sellers&#146; employment with LYV for any reason in
accordance with its terms.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 8%">7.12 <U>Entire Agreement With Respect to Non-Competition and Non-Solicitation</U>. This
<U>ARTICLE VII</U> is intended to be the complete and exclusive statement of the agreement and
understanding of the parties with respect to the non-competition and non-solicit obligations of the
Azoff Sellers and their Affiliates and Related Persons with respect to LYV, FLMG and/or their
Affiliates. Accordingly, this <U>ARTICLE VII</U> supersedes all prior agreements and
understandings between the Azoff Sellers, their Affiliates and Related Persons and the parties
hereto with respect to such non-competition and non-solicitation obligations including those
non-competition and non-solicitation provisions contained in (i)&nbsp;the ILA LNE Employment Agreement;
(ii)&nbsp;the ILA Frontline Employment Agreement; (iii)&nbsp;the Stock Purchase Agreement, dated as of May
11, 2007, by and among FLMG, Ticketmaster Entertainment, Inc, (as successor to IAC/InterActive
Corp) and the other signatories thereto; and (iv)&nbsp;the Amended and Restated Transaction Agreement,
effective as of December&nbsp;31, 2004, among Front Line Management Companies, Inc., Music Management
Holdings, Inc, and the other signatories thereto.

this Agreement indefinitely. The covenants (other than <U>Section&nbsp;5.4(c)</U> and <U>ARTICLE
