5.6 _Certain Matters Regarding the LNE Common Stock_.   

In connection with, and as a condition to, the issuance of any LNE Common
Stock to a Seller, each of (a) the Azoff Sellers, jointly and severally, with
respect to ILA and the Azoff Trust (and not MSG or MSG Sub); and (b) MSG
(which shall be deemed to be a Seller for purposes of this  _Section 5.6_)
and MSG Sub, jointly and severally, with respect to MSG and MSG Sub (and
not ILA or the Azoff Trust) agree as follows:   

(a) Seller acknowledges that such Seller has had an opportunity to review
documents filed by LNE pursuant to the Exchange Act with the SEC subsequent
to December 31, 2008.   

(b) Seller understands that the LNE Common Stock being exchanged have not been
registered with any state or federal agency, partially in reliance upon the
representations herein. Seller acknowledges that the LNE Common Stock issued
hereunder were issued in a transaction believed to be exempt from the
registration provisions of the Securities Act.   

(c) Pursuant to _Section 3.6(a)_, each Seller has represented that such
Seller is an "accredited investor" as that term is defined in Rule 501 of
Regulation D under the Securities Act.   

(d) Seller will not sell or otherwise distribute the LNE Common Stock unless
it is registered under the Securities Act and registered or qualified, if
required, under the securities laws of the states or other jurisdictions in
which it is to be sold, or unless (i) such sale or other distribution may be
effected pursuant to the exemption from registration under the Securities
Act, including the exemption provided by Rule 144 thereunder, or (ii) Seller
delivers to Parent (x) a no-action letter from the SEC and the appropriate
state or other jurisdictions securities officials as to such proposed sale
or sales or (y) an opinion of counsel, which opinion and which counsel shall
be reasonably satisfactory to Parent, to the effect that registration of the
LNE Common Stock is not required under the Securities Act and any such
states or other jurisdictions laws in connection with the proposed sale and
distribution.   

(e) Seller understands and agrees that the certificates for LNE Common Stock
received by it will be legended substantially as follows until such time that
such LNE Common Stock is transferred pursuant to an effective registration
statement or in accordance with an exemption from the registration
requirements of the Securities Act, or until such time as LNE may notify the
transfer agent for such LNE Common Stock that the legend shall be
removed:   

"THE SECURITIES REPRESENTED BY THIS CERTIFICATE HAVE NOT BEEN REGISTERED UNDER
THE SECURITIES ACT OF 1933 AND MAY NOT BE SOLD, TRANSFERRED OR OTHERWISE
DISPOSED OF EXCEPT PURSUANT TO AN EFFECTIVE REGISTRATION STATEMENT OR IN
ACCORDANCE WITH AN EXEMPTION FROM THE REGISTRATION REQUIREMENTS OF THE
SECURITIES ACT OF 1933."   

(f) MSG and MSG Sub hereby agree that MSG Sub will not sell the LNE Common
Stock pursuant to the registration statement contemplated by _Section 5.7_
hereof prior to March 2, 2011.   

5.7 _Resale Shelf Registration Statement_.   

(a) Promptly following the Closing (but in no case later than the close of
business on the first Business Day following the Closing), LNE shall register
for resale on an automatically effective Form S-3 registration statement
filed with the SEC the Registrable Shares exchanged for the Acquired Shares,
and promptly upon the request of any Seller, LNE shall register or
qualify such Registrable Shares under any applicable state securities laws
(if any), and shall keep such registration statement and such registration or
qualification effective, current and available until the earliest of (i) such
time as all Registrable Shares covered thereby have been sold or can be sold
under Rule 144 of the Securities Act without any limitation (including without
the necessity of any filing thereunder), (ii) there are no Registrable Shares
beneficially owned by Sellers or (iii) the first anniversary of the effective
date of such registration statement. If a Seller desires to sell Registrable
Shares after the first anniversary of the effective date of such registration
statement but is prevented from doing so because of limitations under Rule 144
of the Securities Act on the volume or method of transfer applicable to the
sale of such Registrable Shares, then upon written request of such Seller,
LNE will use commercially reasonable efforts to re-register or maintain the
effective registration of such Registrable Shares as set forth
above (including by filing a registration statement on Form S-3, to the
extent available, to re-register such Registrable Shares).   

(b) LNE shall furnish to each Seller an electronic version of a conformed copy
of the registration statement and of each such amendment and supplement
thereto (in each case including all exhibits), an electronic version of a
copy of the prospectus contained in such registration statement and any
supplements thereto and any other prospectus filed under Rule 424 under
the Securities Act, in conformity with the requirements of the Securities
Act, and such other documents, including documents incorporated by reference,
as each Seller may reasonably request.   

(c) LNE shall pay all expenses (other than any underwriting or brokerage fees)
in connection with such registration and resale under the Securities Act, and
such registration or qualification under any applicable state securities laws
(if any). LNE shall cause all Registrable Shares to be listed or included on
the principal securities exchange or quotation system on which LNE
Common Stock is otherwise listed or included from time to time.   

(d) LNE shall indemnify and hold harmless each Seller, and its respective
officers, directors, partners, managers, employees, representatives, agents,
trustees and controlling persons from and against any Loss or any actions in
respect thereof, to which any of such persons may become subject under the
Securities Act or otherwise, arising out of or based upon any untrue statement
or alleged untrue statement of a material fact required to be stated or
necessary to make the statements not misleading in any such registration
statement (including any document incorporated by reference therein), except
to the extent that such Loss is caused by any such untrue statement or
alleged untrue statement based upon information relating to such Seller that
is supplied by such Seller for inclusion in such registration statement
(including any prospectus related thereto).   

(e) Each of (a) the Azoff Sellers, jointly and severally, with respect to ILA
and the Azoff Trust (and not MSG); and (b) MSG, with respect to MSG (and not
ILA or the Azoff Trust) shall indemnify and hold harmless LNE, and its
respective officers, directors, partners, managers, employees,
representatives, agents, trustees and controlling persons from and against any
Loss or any actions in respect thereof, to which any of such persons may
become subject under the Securities Act or otherwise, arising out of or based
upon any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact
required to be stated or necessary to make the statements not misleading in
any such registration statement (including any document incorporated by
reference therein), to the extent, but only to the extent, that such Loss is
caused by any such untrue statement or alleged untrue statement based upon
information relating to such Seller that is supplied by such Seller for
inclusion in such registration statement (including any prospectus related
thereto).   

(f) Upon the filing of the registration statement referred to in _Section
5.7(a)_, LNE shall notify the transfer agent for the Sellers LNE Common
Stock that the restrictive legend described in Section 5.6(e) shall be
removed from the Sellers LNE Common Stock. Promptly (but in no case later
than three (3) Business Days) following a transfer of Registrable Shares by
MSG Sub, MSG Sub shall notify LNE whether such transfer was made pursuant to
an effective registration statement or in accordance with an exemption from
the registration requirements of the Securities Act.   

(g) LNE shall prepare and file in a timely manner, information, documents and
reports in compliance with the Exchange Act so as to comply with the
requirements of such Act and the rules and regulations thereunder. If at any
time LNE is not required to file reports in compliance with either Section 13
or Section 15(d) of the Exchange Act, LNE at its expense will
reasonably promptly, upon the written request of a Seller, make available
adequate current public information with respect to LNE within the meaning of
Rule 144(c)(2) under the Securities Act.   

5.8 _Tax Group Consolidation_. Prior to the Closing, LNE and Holdings shall
cause the dissolution of TicketWeb LLC, a Delaware limited liability company
and shall cause any Common Stock received by Subsidiaries of LNE in
connection with such dissolution to be transferred to Holdings.   

5.9 _FLMG Equity Plan_. Immediately prior to Closing, FLMG shall cause any
FLMG Stock Plans then in effect to terminate as of the Closing.   

ARTICLE VI

6.1 _Indemnification by the Seller_. Each of (a) the Azoff Sellers, jointly
and severally, with respect to ILA and the Azoff Trust (and not MSG or MSG
Sub); and (b) MSG and MSG Sub, jointly and severally, with respect to MSG and
MSG Sub (and not ILA or the Azoff Trust) shall indemnify LNE and Holdings and
their Affiliates, and each of their respective stockholders, partners,
members, officers, directors, employees, agents and representatives (other
than the Sellers) (collectively, the " _Purchaser Indemnitees_ ") against and
hold them harmless from any and all Losses suffered or incurred by any such
Purchaser Indemnitee arising out of or resulting from (i) the failure to be
true of any representation or warranty of such Seller or MSG contained in
_ARTICLE III_ (it being agreed and acknowledged by the parties that only
for purposes of calculating Losses of Purchaser Indemnitees in respect of a
claim for indemnification pursuant to this _Section 6.1_ (and not for
purposes of determining whether or not any such representation and warranty
is true), the representations and warranties of such Seller or MSG contained
in _ARTICLE III_ shall not be deemed qualified by any references herein
to materiality generally, or whether or not any such breach results or may
result in a Material Adverse Effect; it being the intention of the parties
hereto that the Purchaser Indemnitees shall be indemnified and held harmless
from and against any and all Losses suffered or incurred by them resulting
from, arising out of, based on or relating to the failure of any such
representation or warranty to be true, correct and complete in any respect,
determined in each case without regard to any qualification as to materiality
or Material Adverse Effect), or (ii) any breach of any other covenant or
agreement of such Seller or MSG in this Agreement.   

6.2 _Indemnification by LNE and Holdings_. LNE and Holdings shall (and shall
cause any successor in interest to the Acquired Shares to) indemnify the
Sellers, MSG and their respective Affiliates, and each of their respective
stockholders, partners, members, officers, directors, employees, agents and
representatives (collectively, the " _Seller Indemnitees_ ") against and hold
them harmless from any Losses suffered or incurred by the Seller Indemnitees
arising out of or resulting from (i) any Third Party Claim against a Seller
Indemnitee with respect to any matters occurring prior to the Closing based
upon the fact that such Seller was a stockholder of FLMG, (ii) the failure to
be true of any representation or warranty of LNE or Holdings in this Agreement
(it being agreed and acknowledged by the parties that only for purposes of
calculating Losses of the Seller Indemnitees in respect of a claim for
indemnification pursuant to this _Section 6.2_ (and not for purposes of
determining whether or not any such representation and warranty is true), the
representations and warranties of LNE and Holdings contained in _ARTICLE IV_
shall not be deemed qualified by any references herein to materiality
generally, or whether or not any such breach results or may result in a
Material Adverse Effect; it being the intention of the parties hereto that
the Seller Indemnitees shall be indemnified and held harmless from and against
any and all Losses suffered or incurred by them resulting from, arising out
of, based on or relating to the failure of any such representation or
warranty to be true, correct and complete in any respect, determined in each
case without regard to any qualification as to materiality or Material
Adverse Effect), or (iii) any breach of any covenant or agreement of LNE or
Holdings in this Agreement.   

6.3 _Procedures Relating to Indemnification_.   

(a) In order for any indemnified party (" _Indemnified Party_ ") specified in
_Section 6.1_ or _6.2_ , as applicable, to be entitled to any indemnification
provided for under  _Section 6.1_ or _6.2_ , respectively, arising out of or
resulting from any claim made by any Person other than the parties hereto or
any of their Affiliates against the Indemnified Party (each, a " _Third Party
Claim_ "), such Indemnified Party must notify the indemnifying party (the "
_Indemnifying Party_ ") in writing, and in reasonable detail, of the Third
Party Claim promptly after receipt by such Indemnified Party of written
notice of the Third Party Claim;  _provided_ , _however_ , that failure to
give such notification shall not affect the indemnification provided
hereunder except to the extent the Indemnifying Party shall have
been materially and actually prejudiced as a result of such failure.
Thereafter, the Indemnified Party shall deliver to the Indemnifying Party,
within five Business Days after the Indemnified Partys receipt thereof,
copies of all notices and documents (including court papers) received by
the Indemnified Party relating to the Third Party Claim.   

(b) If a Third Party Claim is made against an Indemnified Party, the
Indemnifying Party shall be entitled to participate in the defense thereof
and, if it so chooses and acknowledges its obligation to indemnify the
Indemnified Party therefor, to assume the defense thereof with
counsel selected by the Indemnifying Party; _provided_ that such counsel is
not reasonably objected to by the Indemnified Party. Should the Indemnifying
Party so elect to assume the defense of a Third Party Claim, the Indemnifying
Party shall not be liable to the Indemnified Party for legal expenses
subsequently incurred by the Indemnified Party in connection with the defense
thereof (except in the case of a conflict of interest, as described below).
If the Indemnifying Party assumes such defense, the Indemnified Party shall
have the right to participate in the defense thereof and to employ counsel,
at its own expense, separate from the counsel employed by the Indemnifying
Party, it being understood that the Indemnifying Party shall control such
defense (except that if, in the reasonable judgment of an Indemnified Party,
a conflict of interest exists between the Indemnifying Party and the
Indemnified Party, the Indemnified Party may employ its own counsel, separate
from the counsel employed by the Indemnifying Party, and may control its
defense to the extent deemed necessary by the Indemnified Party). The
Indemnifying Party shall be liable, in respect of any Third Party Claim, for
the fees and expenses of one counsel for all the Indemnified Parties for any
period during which the Indemnifying Party is not assuming the
defense thereof or during a conflict of interest (as described above).   

(c) If the Indemnifying Party so elects to assume the defense of any Third
Party Claim, all of the Indemnified Parties shall cooperate with the
Indemnifying Party in the defense or prosecution thereof. In any event, the
Indemnified Party and its counsel shall cooperate with the Indemnifying Party
and its counsel and, except to the extent related to any conflict of interest,
shall not assert any position in any proceeding inconsistent with that
asserted by the Indemnifying Party;  _provided_ , _however_ , that the
foregoing shall not prevent the Indemnified Party from taking the position
that it is entitled to indemnification hereunder. All out-of-pocket costs
and expenses incurred in connection with an Indemnified Partys cooperation
shall be borne by the Indemnifying Party. Such cooperation shall include the
retention and (upon the Indemnifying Partys request) the provision to the
Indemnifying Party of records and information which are reasonably relevant
to such Third Party Claim, and making employees available on a
mutually convenient basis to provide additional information and explanation
of any material provided hereunder. Whether or not the Indemnifying Party
shall have assumed the defense of a Third Party Claim, the Indemnified Party
shall not be entitled to any indemnification hereunder with respect to any
admission of any liability or any settlement, compromise or discharge of any
Third Party Claim effected without the Indemnifying Partys prior written
consent (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld). If the
Indemnifying Party shall have assumed the defense of a Third Party Claim, the
Indemnified Party shall agree to any settlement, compromise or discharge of
such Third Party Claim which: (i) the Indemnifying Party may recommend; (ii)
by its terms obligates the Indemnifying Party to pay the full amount of the
liability in connection with such Third Party Claim; (iii) releases the
Indemnified Party completely from and in connection with such Third
Party Claim; and (iv) would not otherwise adversely affect the Indemnified
Party or require any relief other than monetary damages.   

(d) Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Indemnifying Party shall not be
entitled to assume the defense of any Third Party Claim (and shall be liable
for the fees and expenses of counsel incurred by the Indemnified Party in
defending such Third Party Claim) if the Third Party Claim seeks an order,
injunction or other equitable relief or relief for other than money damages
against the Indemnified Party. The indemnification required by _Sections
6.1_ and _6.2_ shall be made by periodic payments of the amount thereof
during the course of the investigation or defense, as and when bills are
received or Losses are incurred. All claims under _Sections 6.1_ and  _6.2_
that are Third Party Claims shall be governed by _Section 6.3_.   

(e) The indemnification provisions of this _ARTICLE VI_ (i) shall apply
without regard to, and shall not be subject to, any limitation by reason of
set-off, limitation or otherwise and (ii) are intended to be comprehensive
and not to be limited by any Requirements of Law concerning prominence of
language or waiver of any legal right under any law. The obligations of the
parties set forth in this _ARTICLE VI_ shall be conditioned upon the Closing
having occurred.   

6.4 _Other Claims_. If any Indemnified Party should have a claim against
any Indemnifying Party under _Section 6.1_ or _6.2_ , as applicable, that
does not involve a Third Party Claim being asserted against or sought to be
collected from such Indemnified Party, the Indemnified Party shall deliver
notice of such claim with reasonable promptness to the Indemnifying Party.
The failure by any Indemnified Party so to notify the Indemnifying Party shall
not relieve the Indemnifying Party from any liability which it may have to
such Indemnified Party under  _Section 6.1_ or _6.2_ , as applicable, except
to the extent that the Indemnifying Party demonstrates that it has been
materially and actually prejudiced as a result of such failure. If the
Indemnifying Party does not notify the Indemnified Party within 30 days
following its receipt of such notice that the Indemnifying Party disputes its
liability to the Indemnified Party under  _Section 6.1_ or _6.2_ , as
applicable, such claim specified by the Indemnified Party in such notice
shall be conclusively deemed a liability of the Indemnifying Party under
_Section 6.1_ or _6.2_ , as applicable, and the Indemnifying Party shall pay
the amount of such liability to the Indemnified Party on demand or, in the
case of any notice in which the amount of the Losses (or any portion thereof)
is estimated, on such later date when the amount of such Losses (or such
portion thereof) becomes finally determined. If the Indemnifying Party
disputes its liability with respect to such claim within such 30 day period,
the Indemnifying Party and the Indemnified Party shall resolve such dispute
as follows: (i) first, the parties shall negotiate in good faith to resolve
such dispute for a period of up to 21 days, then (ii) if the
Indemnifying Party and the Indemnified Party are unable to reach an
agreement, such dispute shall be resolved in accordance with _Section
8.8_.   

6.5 _Limit on Indemnification_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
contained in this Agreement, the maximum amount of the obligations of each
Seller under _Section 6.1_ and LNE and Holdings obligation under _Section
6.2_ in the aggregate shall, in each case, be an amount equal to the product
of the Acquired Share Price multiplied by the number of Acquired
Shares exchanged or sold by such Seller, _provided_ that this _Section 6.5_
shall not operate to limit the liability of any party under _ARTICLE VII_.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, MSG and MSG Sub
shall be deemed to a single Seller for purposes of this  _Section
6.5_.   

6.6 _Exclusive Remedy_. Other than in the case of fraud, the right of the
Indemnified Parties to assert claims for indemnification and to receive
indemnification pursuant to this  _ARTICLE VI_ shall, after the Closing, be
the Indemnified Parties sole and exclusive remedy for the matters described
in _Sections 6.1_, _6.2_ and _6.3_.   

6.7 _Tax Treatment; Gross Up Provisions_.   

(a) Except to the extent otherwise required pursuant to a Determination or a
change in Requirements of Law, the parties agree to treat any indemnity
payment made under _Section 6.1_ or _6.2_ as an adjustment to the
consideration paid by LNE in connection with the purchase of the Acquired
Shares for all federal, state, local and foreign tax purposes.   

(b) In connection with the transfer of the ILA Shares pursuant to _Section
2.1(a)_ and the payment to the Azoff Trust of its portion of the Stub Amount
pursuant to _Section 2.5(b)(ii)_ , ILA shall be entitled to receive on the
Closing Date $12,571,984.29. Such "gross up" payment will be made, at LNEs
option, in cash or in shares of LNE Common Stock based on the LNE Closing
Price, and shall satisfy any remaining obligations of FLMG under the
Restricted Stock Award Agreement, dated as of June 8, 2007, between FLMG and
ILA.   

6.8 _No Special Damages_. In no event shall any Indemnifying Party be liable
to any Indemnified Party for any consequential, indirect, incidental or other
similar damages, including lost profits, lost revenues, business
interruption, cost of capital or loss of business reputation or opportunity,
or punitive or special damages for any breach or default under, or any act
or omission arising out of or in any way relating to, this Agreement or the
transactions contemplated hereby (other than indemnification for amounts paid
or payable to third parties in respect of any Third Party Claim for which
indemnification hereunder is otherwise required).   

ARTICLE VII 
 NON-COMPETITION; NON-SOLICITATION    

7.1 _Introduction_. The Azoff Sellers acknowledge and recognize the highly
competitive nature of the businesses of LYV and its Affiliates and
accordingly agree, as a condition to the parties entering into the Agreement,
to the non-competition and non-solicitation provisions contained in this
Section. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this
Agreement, nothing in the _ARTICLE VII_ shall apply to MSG, MSG Sub or any of
their Affiliates.   

7.2 _Non-Competition_. The Azoff Sellers covenant and agree that, from the
Closing until October 29, 2016 (the " _Exclusivity Period_ "), they will not,
directly or indirectly (including through any Affiliate or Related Person),
whether in any of the fifty-eight (58) counties of the State of California,
or in any state or county in the United States or any other foreign country
or jurisdiction in which LYV is presently doing business, do, or directly
or indirectly aid any Person to do, any of the following, without the prior
written consent of the board of directors of LNE (or a committee
thereof):   

(a) engage in the Music Business or any aspect of the Music Business, have any
interest or involvement (whether as agent, employee, consultant, advisor,
creditor, lender, proprietor, partner, stockholder, officer, director, member
or other type of principal) in, participate, assist or render any services or
give advice to, whether for compensation or not, any Person (other than LYV)
which is engaged in or becomes engaged in the Music Business with respect to
the Music Business;   

(b) advise, solicit, request or instruct any Business Partner to use the
services of a competitor of LYV in a manner that could reasonably be expected
to result in the cessation or a material reduction in the amount of the
business between the Business Partner and LYV;   

(c) advise, request or instruct any present customer of, or Artist, or other
talent or executive talent known to be associated with, FLMG or its
Subsidiaries to withdraw, curtail or cancel or in any other way lessen its
business dealing with FLMG or its Subsidiaries; or   

(d) except as necessary for the conduct of LYVs affairs in the ordinary
course of business consistent with past practices, disclose to any Person the
names of past or present Business Partners or material terms of any Contracts
(including the term or existence thereof) of past or present Business
Partners, Artists or other talent or executive talent or employees
associated with, or any trade secrets or confidential information of FLMG and
its Subsidiaries.   

7.3 _Non-Solicitation_. During the shorter of (x) while ILA is employed by
FLMG and during any period in which the Azoff Sellers continue to receive
payments of base salary and/or annual bonus from FLMG (provided, that, in no
event shall such period extend beyond one year following the termination of
ILAs employment with FLMG) and (y) the Exclusivity Period, the Azoff Sellers
shall not in any way, directly or indirectly, for the purpose of conducting or
engaging in the Music Business (i) call upon, solicit, advise, sign, hire,
interfere with, or otherwise do, or attempt to do, business with any Artist
or other talent or employee of FLMG or any of its Subsidiaries except on
behalf of LYV, or (ii) take away or interfere or attempt to interfere
with any custom, trade, business or patronage of FLMG or any of its
Subsidiaries, or (iii) induce or attempt to induce any Person under a written
or oral agreement to violate the terms of their contracts or employment
arrangements with LYV, or (iv) induce or attempt to induce any Person
to leave the employ of FLMG or any of its Subsidiaries, or (v) engage in any
similar activity that is competitive with LYV or any of its businesses
(including FLMG) with respect to the Music Business.   

7.4 _Limits on Non-Solicitation_. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Azoff
Sellers are not precluded from soliciting any former employee of LYV or its
Affiliates who (x) responds to any public advertisement or general
solicitation; (y) has been terminated by LYV prior to the solicitation; or
(z) was such Azoff Sellers personal assistant or secretary. This
_Section 7.4_ does not apply to any Artist or Business Partner. In addition,
ILAs investment in TBA Global Events LLC shall not be deemed a violation of
_Sections 7.2 and 7.3_ so long as it does not materially interfere with the
performance of his duties hereunder and the Azoff Sellers may solicit
Business Partners during the Exclusivity Period with respect to transactions
or matters that are not prohibited by _Sections 7.2 and 7.3_ (e.g.,
charitable endeavors) without being in violation of _Section 7.2(b)_
above.   

7.5 _Tolling of Exclusivity Period_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
in this Agreement, the Exclusivity Period with respect to the Azoff Sellers
shall be extended by the length of any period during which any Azoff Seller
is in breach of the terms of this _ARTICLE VII_.   

7.6 _Specific Performance_. The Azoff Sellers acknowledge and agree that LYVs
remedies at law for a breach or threatened breach of any of the provisions of
this _ARTICLE VII_ would be inadequate, impracticable and extremely difficult
to prove, and LYV would suffer irreparable damages as a result of such breach
or threatened breach. In recognition of this fact, the Azoff Sellers agree
that, in the event of such a breach or threatened breach, in addition to any
remedies at law, LYV, without posting any bond, shall be entitled to obtain
equitable relief in the form of specific performance, temporary restraining
order, temporary or permanent injunction or any other equitable remedy which
may then be available.   

7.7 _Geographic Coverage and Sale of Business; Term_. The covenants contained
in this  _ARTICLE VII_ constitute a series of separate covenants, one for
each of those counties and states in the United States and each of the those
foreign countries or jurisdictions referred to in  _ARTICLE VII_. Except for
geographic coverage, each such separate covenant contained in  _ARTICLE VII_
hereof shall be deemed identical in terms. The Azoff Sellers agree (i)
the covenants contained herein are reasonable under the circumstances (e.g.,
in connection with the disposition of the Azoff Sellers entire equity
interest in FLMG at the Azoff Sellers request prior to the time that the
Azoff Sellers would have been entitled to put them to LYV), (ii) the Azoff
Sellers have consulted with counsel of their choosing, and based upon such
counsels advice, the covenants contained herein constitute a valid and
enforceable agreement under Section 16601 of the California Business and
Professional Code because the Azoff Sellers are selling the
remaining ownership interest in FLMG within their control and/or the Azoff
Sellers are selling the goodwill they created in FLMG, and (iii) the Azoff
Sellers will not contest the validity or unenforceability of this _ARTICLE
VII_ during the Exclusivity Period. The term of the Exclusivity Period
was determined by the parties to be reasonable based on the nature of the
Music Business and duration of the underlying non-compete agreement which
this _ARTICLE VII_ supersedes.   

7.8 _Severability_. If a final judicial determination is made by a court of
competent jurisdiction that the time or territory or any other restriction in
that regard is an unenforceable restriction against the Azoff Sellers, the
provisions of this Agreement shall not be rendered void but shall be deemed
amended to apply as to such maximum time and territory and to such
maximum extent as such court may judicially determine or indicate to be
enforceable. Alternatively, if any court of competent jurisdiction finds that
any such restriction incorporated by reference in this Agreement is
unenforceable, and such restriction cannot be amended so as to make it
enforceable, such finding shall not prejudice or in any way affect the
validity or enforceability of any other paragraph, clause, sub-clause or
provision. This Agreement and each paragraph, clause, sub-clause and
provision hereof shall be read and construed so as to give thereto the full
effect thereof subject only to any contrary provision of law to the extent
that when this _ARTICLE VII_ or any paragraph, clause, sub-clause or
provision hereof would, but for the provisions of this  _ARTICLE VII_ , have
been read and construed as being void and ineffective, it shall nevertheless
be a valid agreement, covenant, paragraph, clause, sub-clause or provision as
the case may be to the full extent to which it is not contrary to any
provision at law.   

7.9 _Passive Investment_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary stated in
this  _ARTICLE VII_ , it is agreed by the parties to this Agreement that
nothing in this Agreement shall limit the Azoff Sellers right to continue to
own, as a passive investor, and not as an officer, director, representative,
consultant or otherwise, any other Excluded Businesses.   

7.10 _FLMG Conflict of Interest_. In light of the fact LYV frequently enters
into agreements with (i) Artists, (ii) other entertainment and/or media
clients of FLMG (as FLMGs business is currently conducted) (including any
Person that renders creative services or conducts activities in the
entertainment and/or media industries), or (iii) clients of FLMG other than
those falling under clauses (i) or (ii) (as approved by the then CEO of LNE
within his scope of authority), each party to this Agreement acknowledges
that it is the intent of the parties that, in any situation in which the
interests of FLMG and/or any of its Artists or other clients (as described in
clauses (ii)  (iii)) are or may be adverse to the interests of LYV, the Azoff
Sellers (while employed by FLMG) are to act solely in the interests of FLMG
and such Artists or other clients of FLMG, and that the Azoff Sellers have no
duty whatsoever to act in the interests of LYV. The Azoff Sellers and FLMG
hereby amend the ILA Front Line Employment Agreement by deleting Section
12(i) and replacing it with the provisions contained in this _Section
7.10_.   

7.11 _Survival_. The provisions of this _ARTICLE VII_ with respect to the
Azoff Sellers shall survive the termination of the Azoff Sellers employment
with LYV for any reason in accordance with its terms.   

7.12 _Entire Agreement With Respect to Non-Competition and Non-Solicitation_.
This  _ARTICLE VII_ is intended to be the complete and exclusive statement of
the agreement and understanding of the parties with respect to the non-
competition and non-solicit obligations of the Azoff Sellers and their
Affiliates and Related Persons with respect to LYV, FLMG and/or
their Affiliates. Accordingly, this _ARTICLE VII_ supersedes all prior
agreements and understandings between the Azoff Sellers, their Affiliates and
Related Persons and the parties hereto with respect to such non-competition
and non-solicitation obligations including those non-competition and non-
solicitation provisions contained in (i) the ILA LNE Employment
Agreement; (ii) the ILA Frontline Employment Agreement; (iii) the Stock
Purchase Agreement, dated as of May 11, 2007, by and among FLMG, Ticketmaster
Entertainment, Inc, (as successor to IAC/InterActive Corp) and the other
signatories thereto; and (iv) the Amended and Restated Transaction
Agreement, effective as of December 31, 2004, among Front Line Management
Companies, Inc., Music Management Holdings, Inc, and the other signatories
thereto.   

ARTICLE VIII

of limitations, after which no claim for indemnification under this Agreement
may be asserted in respect thereof, _provided_ that any such claim made prior

Form Of Spousal Consent

a Delaware limited liability company wholly-owned by MSG (" _MSG Sub_ ", and,
