ARTICLE II



The Merger



2.01 _The Parent Merger_. At the Effective Time, (i) SBI shall be merged with
and into Sky (the _"Parent Merger"_ ), and (ii) the separate corporate
existence of SBI shall cease and Sky shall survive and continue to exist as an
Ohio corporation (Sky, as the surviving corporation in the Parent Merger,
sometimes being referred to herein as the  _"Surviving Corporation"_ ). The
Sky Articles, as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time, shall be
the Articles of Incorporation of the Surviving Corporation, and the Sky Code,
as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time, shall be the Code of
Regulations of the Surviving Corporation. Sky may at any time prior to the
Effective Time change the method of effecting the Merger (including, without
limitation, the provisions of this Article II) if and to the extent it deems
such change to be necessary, appropriate or desirable; _provided, however_ ,
that no such change shall (i) alter or change the amount or kind of
consideration to be issued to holders of SBI Shares as provided for in Article
III of this Agreement (subject to adjustment as provided in Sections 3.05 and
8.01(e)) (the _"Merger Consideration"_ ), (ii) adversely affect the tax
treatment of SBIs shareholders as a result of receiving the Merger
Consideration, or (iii) materially impede or delay consummation of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement.



2.02 _The Subsidiary Merger_. At the time determined by Sky and specified by
Sky Bank in its Certificate of Merger filed with the OSS (which shall not be
earlier than the Effective Time), Bank shall merge with and into Sky Bank
(the " _Subsidiary Merger_ ") pursuant to an



 

6 agreement to merge (the " _Agreement to Merge_ ") to be executed by Bank and
Sky Bank and filed with the OSS, as required. Sky, in its discretion, shall
determine which banking entity shall survive following the consummation of the
Subsidiary Merger; however, it is anticipated that the separate corporate
existence of Bank shall cease and Sky Bank shall survive and continue to
exist as a state banking corporation. (The Parent Merger and the Subsidiary
Merger shall sometimes collectively be referred to as the " _Merger"_.)



2.03 _Effectiveness of the Parent Merger_. Subject to the satisfaction or
waiver of the conditions set forth in Article VII, the Parent Merger shall
become effective upon the occurrence of the filing in the office of the OSS of
a certificate of merger in accordance with Section 1701.81 of the OGCL, or
such later date and time as may be set forth in such filing.



2.04 _Effective Date and Effective Time_. Subject to the satisfaction or
waiver of the conditions set forth in Article VII, Sky shall cause the
effective date of the Parent Merger (the _"Effective Date"_ ) to occur (i) as
soon as reasonably practicable after the last of the conditions set forth in
Article VII shall have been satisfied or waived in accordance with the terms
of this Agreement (but in no event later than the last business day in the
month immediately following the month in which all waiting periods
under Regulatory Authority approval or any extension thereof have expired);
or (ii) on such other date to which the parties may agree in writing;
_provided, however,_ that the Effective Date shall not fall after the date
specified in Section 8.01(c) hereof or after the date or dates on which any
Regulatory Authority approval or any extension thereof expires. The time on
the Effective Date when the Parent Merger shall become effective is referred
to as the _"Effective Time."_  



ARTICLE III



Consideration; Exchange Procedures



3.01 _Merger Consideration_. Subject to the provisions of this Agreement, at
the Effective Time, automatically by virtue of the Parent Merger and without
any action on the part of any Person:



(a) _Outstanding SBI Shares_. Each SBI Share, excluding Treasury Stock and
Dissenting Shares, issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective
Time shall become and be converted into one and twenty-six one hundredths
(1.26) of a Sky Common Share (the "Exchange Ratio"). The Exchange Ratio shall
be subject to adjustment as set forth in Sections 3.05, 8.01(b) and 8.01(e).



(b) _Treasury Shares_. Each SBI Share held as Treasury Stock and each SBI
Share held by Sky immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be canceled
and retired at the Effective Time and no consideration shall be issued in
exchange therefor.



(c) _Dissenting Shares_. Dissenting Shares shall not be exchanged for Sky
Common Shares but rather shall be entitled to the rights set forth in Sections
1701.84 and 1701.85 of the OGCL. Notwithstanding any other provision of this
Agreement, any Dissenting Shares shall not, after the Effective Time,
be entitled to vote for any purpose or receive any dividends or other
distributions (except dividends or other distributions payable to shareholders
of record of SBI at a date which is prior to the Effective Date)



 

7 and shall be entitled only to such rights as are afforded in respect of
Dissenting Shares pursuant to the OGCL.



(d) _Outstanding Sky Common Shares_. Each Sky Common Share issued and
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall remain issued and
outstanding and unaffected by the Merger.



3.02 _Rights as Shareholders; Stock Transfers_. At the Effective Time, holders
of SBI Shares shall cease to be, and shall have no rights as, shareholders of
SBI, other than to receive any dividend or other distribution with respect to
such SBI Shares with a record date occurring prior to the Effective Time and
the consideration provided under this Article III, and the appraisal rights
in the case of Dissenting Shares. After the Effective Time, there shall be no
transfers on the stock transfer books of SBI or the Surviving Corporation of
any SBI Shares.



3.03 _Fractional Shares_. Notwithstanding any other provision hereof, no
fractional Sky Common Shares and no certificates or scrip therefor, or other
evidence of ownership thereof, will be issued in the Merger; instead, Sky
shall pay to each holder of SBI Shares who would otherwise be entitled to a
fractional Sky Common Share (after taking into account all Old Certificates
delivered by such holder) an amount in cash (without interest) determined by
multiplying such fractional Sky Common Share to which the holder would be
entitled by the average closing price of Sky Common Shares (as reported by
the NASDAQ, as reported in _The Wall Street Journal_ or, if not reported
therein, in another authoritative source) for the ten (10) trading days
immediately preceding the Effective Date.



3.04 _Exchange Procedures_.



(a) At or prior to the Effective Time, Sky shall deposit, or shall cause to
be deposited, with The Bank of New York (in such capacity, the _"Exchange
Agent"_ ), for the benefit of the holders of certificates formerly
representing SBI Shares ( _"Old Certificates"_ ), for exchange in accordance
with this Article III, certificates representing the Sky Common Shares ( _"New
Certificates"_ ) and an estimated amount of cash (such cash and New
Certificates, together with any dividends or distributions having a
record date occurring on or after the Effective Date with respect thereto
(without any interest on any such cash, dividends or distributions), being
hereinafter referred to as the _"Exchange Fund"_ ) to be paid pursuant to this
Article III in exchange for outstanding SBI Shares.



(b) As promptly as practicable after the Effective Date, Sky shall send or
cause to be sent to each former holder of record of SBI Shares immediately
prior to the Effective Time transmittal materials for use in exchanging such
shareholders Old Certificates for the consideration set forth in this
Article III. Sky shall cause the New Certificates into which shares of a
shareholders SBI Shares are converted on the Effective Date and/or any check
in respect of any fractional share interests or dividends or distributions
which such person shall be entitled to receive to be delivered to such
shareholder upon delivery to the Exchange Agent of Old Certificates
representing such SBI Shares (or an indemnity affidavit
reasonably satisfactory to Sky and the Exchange Agent, if any of such
certificates are lost, stolen or destroyed) owned by such shareholder together
with a duly completed and executed letter of transmittal. No interest will be
paid on any such cash to be paid in lieu of fractional share interests or in
respect of dividends



 

8 or distributions that any such person shall be entitled to receive pursuant to
this Article III upon such delivery.



(c) Notwithstanding the foregoing, neither the Exchange Agent, if any, nor
any party hereto shall be liable to any former holder of SBI Shares for any
amount properly delivered to a public official pursuant to applicable
abandoned property, escheat or similar laws.



(d) No dividends or other distributions with respect to Sky Common Shares
with a record date occurring on or after the Effective Date shall be paid to
the holder of any unsurrendered Old Certificate representing SBI Shares
converted in the Merger into the right to receive such Sky Common Shares until
the holder thereof shall be entitled to receive New Certificates in exchange
therefor in accordance with the procedures set forth in this Section 3.04.
After becoming so entitled in accordance with this Section 3.04, the record
holder thereof also shall be entitled to receive any such dividends or other
distributions, without any interest thereon, which theretofor had become
payable with respect to Sky Common Shares such holder had the right to receive
upon surrender of the Old Certificates. 



(e) Any portion of the Exchange Fund that remains unclaimed by the
shareholders of SBI for six months after the Effective Time shall be paid to
Sky. Any shareholders of SBI who have not theretofore complied with this
Article III shall thereafter look only to Sky for payment of the Sky Common
Shares, cash in lieu of any fractional shares and unpaid dividends and
distributions on Sky Common Shares deliverable in respect of each SBI Share
such shareholder holds as determined pursuant to this Agreement, in each case,
without any interest thereon.



3.05 _Anti-Dilution Provisions_. In the event Sky changes (or establishes a
record date for changing) the number of Sky Common Shares issued and
outstanding between the date hereof and the Effective Date as a result of a

terminated immediately prior to the Effective Time and each grantee thereof
shall be entitled to receive, in lieu of the SBI Shares that would otherwise
have been issuable upon exercise thereof, an amount in cash computed by
multiplying (a) the excess, if any, of (i) the closing price of Sky Common
Shares on the trading day immediately preceding the Effective Date multiplied
by the Exchange Ratio over (ii) the exercise price of such SBI Stock Option
by (b) the number of SBI Shares subject to the SBI Stock Option. SBI shall
use commercially reasonable efforts to take or cause to be taken all action
necessary to obtain a written consent from each holder of a SBI Stock Option
to permit such termination effective at the Effective Date. SBI may elect to

lieu of the SBI Shares that would have been issuable thereunder, an amount in
cash computed by multiplying (a) the closing price of Sky Common Shares on the

Exchange Ratio by (b) the number of SBI Shares subject to the performance
stock award agreement.

5.01 _Disclosure Schedules_. On or prior to the date hereof, Sky has
delivered to SBI a schedule and SBI has delivered to Sky a schedule
(respectively, its _"Disclosure Schedule"_ ) setting forth, among other
things, items, the disclosure of which are necessary or appropriate either in
response to an express disclosure requirement contained in a provision hereof
or as an exception to one or more representations or warranties contained in
Section 5.03 or 5.04 or to one or more of its respective covenants contained
in Article IV and Article VI;  _provided_ , _however,_ that (a) no such item
is required to be set forth in a Disclosure Schedule as an exception to a
representation or warranty if its absence would not be reasonably likely to
result in the related representation or warranty being deemed untrue or
incorrect under the standard established by Section 5.02, and (b) the mere
inclusion of an item in a Disclosure Schedule as an exception to a
representation or warranty shall not be deemed an admission by a party
that such item represents a material exception or fact, event or circumstance
or that such item is reasonably likely to have or result in a Material Adverse
Effect on the party making the representation. SBIs representations,
warranties and covenants contained in this Agreement shall not be deemed



 

13 to be untrue, incorrect or to have been breached as a result of effects on SBI
arising solely from actions taken in compliance with a written request of
Sky.



5.02  _Standard_. No representation or warranty of SBI or Sky contained in
Section 5.03 or 5.04 shall be deemed untrue or incorrect, and no party hereto
shall be deemed to have breached a representation or warranty, as a
consequence of the existence of any fact, event or circumstance unless such
fact, circumstance or event, individually or taken together with all other
facts, events or circumstances inconsistent with any representation or
warranty contained in Section 5.03 or 5.04 has had, or is reasonably likely
to have, a Material Adverse Effect.



5.03 _Representations and Warranties of SBI_. Subject to Sections 5.01 and
5.02 and except as Previously Disclosed, SBI hereby represents and warrants to
Sky:



(a) _Organization, Standing and Authority_. SBI is a corporation duly

Holding Company Act of 1956, as amended. Bank is a national banking
association that is duly organized, and validly existing under federal law and
with the OCC. Bank is not required to be qualified to do business in any state

conducts its business.



(b) _Capital Structure of SBI_. The authorized capital stock of SBI consists
solely of common shares, of which 9,471,371 are outstanding as of the date

have been duly authorized, are validly issued and outstanding, fully paid and
nonassessable, and are not subject to any preemptive rights (and were not
issued in violation of any preemptive rights). As of the date hereof, except
pursuant to this Agreement and the SBI Stock Plan or as Previously Disclosed
(i) there are no SBI Shares authorized and reserved for issuance, (ii) SBI
does not have any Rights issued or outstanding with respect to SBI Shares, and

SBI owns, directly or indirectly, all the issued and outstanding equity

Subsidiaries are or may become required to be issued (other than to it or

such Subsidiaries is or may be bound to sell or otherwise transfer any equity

Subsidiaries), (E) there are no contracts, commitments, understandings, or
arrangements relating to its rights to



 

14 vote or to dispose of such securities and (F) all the equity securities of
each Subsidiary held by SBI or its Subsidiaries are fully paid and
nonassessable (except pursuant to 12 U.S.C. Section 55) and are owned by SBI
or its Subsidiaries free and clear of any Liens.



(ii) Except as Previously Disclosed, SBI does not own beneficially, directly
or indirectly, any equity securities or similar interests of any Person, or
any interest in a partnership or joint venture of any kind, other than its
Subsidiaries.



(iii) Each of SBIs Subsidiaries has been duly organized and is validly
existing in good standing under the laws of the jurisdiction of its
organization, and is duly qualified to do business and in good standing in the
jurisdictions where its ownership or leasing of property or the conduct of its
business requires it to be so qualified.



(d) _Corporate Power; Authorized and Effective Agreement_. Each of SBI and
its Subsidiaries has full corporate power and authority to carry on its
business as it is now being conducted and to own all its properties and
assets. SBI has the corporate power and authority to execute, deliver

consummate the Subsidiary Merger and the Agreement to Merge in accordance with
the terms of this Agreement.

Agreement by the holders of a majority of the outstanding SBI Shares entitled

Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby have been authorized by
all necessary corporate action of SBI and the SBI Board prior to the date
hereof. The Agreement to Merge, when executed by Bank, shall have been
approved by the Board of Directors of Bank and by the SBI Board, as the sole
shareholder of Bank. This Agreement is a valid and legally binding obligation
of SBI, enforceable against SBI in accordance with its terms (except as
enforceability may be limited by applicable bankruptcy, insolvency,
reorganization, moratorium, fraudulent transfer and similar laws of general
applicability relating to or affecting creditors rights or by general equity
principles and except to the extent such enforceability may be limited by laws
relating to the safety and soundness of insured depository institutions as
set forth in 12 U.S.C. Section 1818(b) or the appointment of a conservator by
the FDIC).



(f) _Regulatory Filings; No Defaults_.



(i) No consents or approvals of, or filings or registrations with, any
Governmental Authority or with any third party are required to be made or
obtained by SBI or any of its Subsidiaries in connection with the execution,

objections of such Regulatory Authorities), (B) filings with the SEC and state
securities



  

15 authorities, and (C) the filing of the certificate of merger with the OSS

without the imposition of a condition, restriction or requirement of the type
described in Section 7.01(b).



(ii) Except as Previously Disclosed, subject to receipt of the regulatory and
shareholder approvals referred to above, expiration of related regulatory
waiting periods and required filings under federal and state securities laws,
the execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement and the
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby do not and will not (A)
constitute a breach or violation of, or a default under, or give rise to any
Lien, any acceleration of remedies or any right of termination under, any law,
rule or regulation or any judgment, decree, order, governmental permit or
license, or agreement, indenture or instrument of SBI or of any of its
Subsidiaries or to which SBI or any of its Subsidiaries or properties is
subject or bound, (B) constitute a breach or violation of, or a default
under, the SBI Articles or the SBI Code, or (C) require any consent or

2001 and 2002 and all other reports, registration statements, definitive proxy
statements or information statements filed or to be filed by it or any of its
Subsidiaries subsequent to December 31, 2002 under the Securities Act, or
under Section 13, 14, or 15(d) of the Exchange Act, in the form filed or to be

respects with the applicable requirements under the Securities Act or the
Exchange Act, as the case may be, and (B) did not and will not contain any
untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact required
to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein, in light of
the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading; and each of the

of income, changes in shareholders equity, and cash flows in such SBI SEC
Documents (including any related notes and schedules thereto) fairly presents,

as Previously Disclosed, (A) SBI and its Subsidiaries have conducted their
respective businesses in the ordinary and usual course consistent with past
practice (excluding matters related to this Agreement and the transactions
contemplated hereby) and (B) no event has occurred or circumstance arisen
that, individually or taken together with all other facts, circumstances and
events (described in any paragraph of Section 5.03 or otherwise), is
reasonably likely to have a Material Adverse Effect with respect to SBI.



(h) _Litigation_. Except as Previously Disclosed, and subject to routine
benefit claims pursuant to Plans disclosed under Section 5.03(m), no material
litigation, claim or other proceeding before any court or governmental agency
is pending against SBI or any of its Subsidiaries and, to SBIs knowledge, no
such litigation, claim or other proceeding has been threatened.



(i) _Regulatory Matters_.



(i) Except as Previously Disclosed, neither SBI nor any of its Subsidiaries or

Regulatory Authorities.



(ii) Neither it nor any of its Subsidiaries has been advised by any
Regulatory Authority that such Regulatory Authority is contemplating issuing

any such order, decree, agreement, memorandum of understanding, commitment
letter, supervisory letter or similar submission.



(j)  _Compliance with Laws_. Each of SBI and its Subsidiaries:



(i) is in compliance with all applicable federal, state, local and foreign
statutes, laws, regulations, ordinances, rules, judgments, orders or decrees
applicable thereto or to the employees conducting such businesses, including,

from any Regulatory Authority or Governmental Authority (A)



 

17 asserting that SBI or any of its Subsidiaries is not in compliance with any of
the statutes, regulations, or ordinances that such Regulatory Authority or
Governmental Authority enforces or (B) threatening to revoke any license,
franchise, permit, or governmental authorization (nor, to SBIs knowledge, do
any grounds for any of the foregoing exist). 



(k) _Material Contracts; Defaults_. Except for this Agreement and those
agreements and other documents filed as exhibits to the SBI SEC Documents, or
except as Previously Disclosed, neither SBI nor any of its Subsidiaries is a
party to, bound by or subject to any agreement, contract, arrangement,
commitment or understanding (whether written or oral) (i) that is a "material
contract" within the meaning of Item 601(b)(10) of the SECs Regulation S-K or
(ii) that restricts or limits in any way the conduct of business by it or any
of its Subsidiaries (including without limitation a non-compete or similar
provision). Neither it nor any of its Subsidiaries is in default under any
contract, agreement, commitment, arrangement, lease, insurance policy or
other instrument to which it is a party, by which its respective assets,
business, or operations may be bound or affected in any way, or under which it
or its respective assets, business, or operations receive benefits, and there
has not occurred any event that, with the lapse of time or the giving of
notice or both, would constitute such a default.



(l) _No Brokers_. Except for the Previously Disclosed fees payable to Sandler
ONeill and Partners, L.P., no action has been taken by SBI that would give
rise to any valid claim against any party hereto for a brokerage commission,
finders fee or other like payment with respect to the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement.



(m) _Employee Benefit Plans_.



(i) Section 5.03(m)(i) of SBIs Disclosure Schedule contains a complete and
accurate list of all existing bonus, incentive, deferred compensation,
pension, retirement, profit-sharing, thrift, savings, employee stock
ownership, stock bonus, stock purchase, restricted stock, stock option,
severance, welfare and fringe benefit plans, employment agreements,
consulting agreements, change-in-control agreements, or severance agreements
and all similar practices, policies and arrangements maintained or contributed
to by SBI or any of its Subsidiaries and in which any employee or former
employee (the _"Employees"_ ), consultant or former consultant (the
_"Consultants"_ ) or director or former director (the _"Directors"_ ) of SBI
or any of its Subsidiaries participates or to which any such Employees,
Consultants or Directors are a party (the _"Compensation and Benefit Plans"_ )
other than programs within Department of Labor Reg. §2510.3-1(b). Neither SBI
nor any of its Subsidiaries has any commitment to create any additional
Compensation and Benefit Plan or to modify or change any existing Compensation
and Benefit Plan, except as otherwise contemplated by Section 4.01(e) of this
Agreement or as required by applicable law. 



(ii) Each Compensation and Benefit Plan has been operated and administered in
all material respects in accordance with its terms and applicable law,
including, but not limited to, ERISA, the Code, the Securities Act, the
Exchange Act, the Age Discrimination in Employment Act, or any regulations or



 

18 rules promulgated thereunder, and all filings, disclosures and notices
required by ERISA, the Code, the Securities Act, the Exchange Act, the Age
Discrimination in Employment Act and any other applicable law have been or
will be timely made. Each Compensation and Benefit Plan that is an "employee
pension benefit plan" within the meaning of Section 3(2) of ERISA (a
_"Pension Plan"_ ) and that is intended to be qualified under Section 401(a)
of the Code has received (or has applied for or will timely apply for) a
favorable determination letter (including a determination that the related
trust under such Compensation and Benefit Plan is exempt from tax under
Section 501(a) of the Code) from the Internal Revenue Service ( _"IRS"_ ), and
SBI is not aware of any circumstances likely to result in revocation of any
such favorable determination letter. There is no material pending or, to the
knowledge of SBI, threatened legal action, suit or claim relating to the
Compensation and Benefit Plans other than routine claims for benefits
thereunder. Neither SBI nor any of its Subsidiaries has engaged in a
transaction, or omitted to take any action, with respect to any Compensation
and Benefit Plan that would reasonably be expected to subject SBI or any of
its Subsidiaries to a tax or penalty imposed by either Section 4975 of the
Code or Section 502 of ERISA, assuming for purposes of Section 4975 of the
Code that the taxable period of any such transaction expired as of the date
hereof.



(iii) No liability (other than for payment of premiums to the PBGC that have
been made or will be made on a timely basis) under Title IV of ERISA has been
or is expected to be incurred by SBI or any of its Subsidiaries with respect
to any ongoing, frozen or terminated "single-employer plan," within the
meaning of Section 4001(a)(15) of ERISA, currently or formerly maintained by
any of them, or any single-employer plan of any entity (an _"ERISA Affiliate"_
) that is considered one employer with SBI under Section 4001(a)(14) of ERISA
or Section 414(b) or (c) of the Code (an  _"ERISA Affiliate Plan"_ ). None of
SBI, any of its Subsidiaries nor any ERISA Affiliate has contributed, or has
been obligated to contribute, to a multiemployer plan under Subtitle E of
Title IV of ERISA at any time since September 26, 1980. No notice of a
"reportable event", within the meaning of Section 4043 of ERISA for which the
30-day reporting requirement has not been waived, has been required to be
filed for any Compensation and Benefit Plan or by any ERISA Affiliate Plan
within the 12-month period ending on the date hereof, and no such notice will
be required to be filed as a result of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement. The PBGC has not instituted proceedings to terminate any
Pension Plan or ERISA Affiliate Plan and, to SBIs knowledge, no condition
exists that presents a material risk that such proceedings will be instituted.
To the knowledge of SBI, there is no pending investigation or enforcement
action by the PBGC, the Department of Labor or IRS or any other governmental
agency with respect to any Compensation and Benefit Plan. Under each Pension
Plan and ERISA Affiliate Plan that is a "defined benefit plan" within the
meaning of ERISA Section 3(35), as of the date of the most recent actuarial
valuation performed prior to the date of this Agreement, the actuarially
determined present value of all "benefit liabilities", within the meaning of
Section 4001(a)(16) of ERISA (as determined on the basis of the actuarial
assumptions contained in such actuarial valuation of such Pension Plan or
ERISA Affiliate Plan), did not exceed the then current value of the assets of
such Pension

employment prior to or following the Effective Time), none of Sky, SBI or the
Surviving Corporation, or any of their respective Subsidiaries will be
obligated to make a payment that would be characterized as an "excess
parachute payment" to an individual who is a "disqualified individual" (as
such terms are defined in Section 280G of the Code or any corresponding
provision of state, local or foreign Tax law) of SBI on a consolidated basis,
without regard to whether such payment is reasonable compensation for personal

limitation, in a fiduciary or agency capacity), or on which any of them holds
a Lien, violates or violated Environmental Laws and to SBIs knowledge, no
condition has existed or event has occurred with respect to any of them or any
such property that, with notice or the passage of time, or both, is
reasonably likely to result in liability under Environmental Laws. To SBIs
knowledge, neither SBI nor any of its Subsidiaries has received any notice
from any person or entity that SBI or its Subsidiaries or the operation or
condition of any property ever owned, leased, operated, or held as collateral
or in a fiduciary capacity by any of them are or were in violation of or
otherwise are alleged to have liability under any Environmental Law,
including, but not limited to, responsibility (or potential responsibility)

Except as disclosed on Section 5.03(q) of SBIs Disclosure Schedule:



(i) SBI and each of its Subsidiaries have filed all Tax Returns that they
were required to file under applicable laws and regulations. All such Tax
Returns were correct and complete in all respects and have been prepared in
substantial compliance with all applicable laws and regulations. All Taxes
due and owing by SBI or any of its Subsidiaries (whether or not shown on any
Tax Return) have been paid. Neither SBI nor any of its Subsidiaries currently
is the beneficiary of any extension of time within which to file any Tax
Return. No claim has ever been made by an authority in a jurisdiction where
SBI or any of its Subsidiaries does not file Tax Returns that it is or may be

than Taxes not yet due and payable) upon any of the assets of SBI or any of
its subsidiaries.



(ii) SBI and each of its Subsidiaries have withheld and paid all Taxes
required to have been withheld and paid in connection with any amounts paid
or owing to any employee, independent contractor, creditor, stockholder, or
other third party.



(iii) The earliest taxable period of SBI and its Subsidiaries for which the
statute of limitations is still open is calendar year 2000. No director or
officer (or employee responsible for Tax matters) of SBI or any of its
Subsidiaries expects any authority to assess any additional Taxes for any
period for which Tax Returns have been filed. No foreign, federal, state, or
local tax audits or administrative or judicial Tax proceedings are pending or
being conducted with respect to SBI or any of its Subsidiaries. Neither SBI
nor any of its Subsidiaries has received from any foreign, federal, state or
local taxing authority (including jurisdictions where SBI or its Subsidiaries
have not filed Tax Returns) any (i) notice indicating an intent to open an
audit or other review, (ii) request for information related to Tax matters, or
(iii) notice of deficiency or proposed adjustment for any amount of Tax
proposed, asserted, or assessed by any taxing authority against SBI or any of
its Subsidiaries. The Disclosure Schedule lists all



 

22 federal, state, local, and foreign income Tax Returns filed with respect to

December 31, 2001.



(iv) Neither SBI nor any of its Subsidiaries has waived any statute of
limitations in respect of Taxes or agreed to any extension of time with
respect to a Tax assessment or deficiency.



(v) Neither SBI nor any of its Subsidiaries has filed a consent under Code
Section 341(f) concerning collapsible corporations. SBI and each of its
Subsidiaries have disclosed on their federal income Tax Returns all positions
taken therein that could give rise to a substantial understatement of federal
income Tax within the meaning of Code Section 6662. Neither SBI nor any of
its Subsidiaries is a party to or bound by any Tax allocation or sharing

group the common parent of which was SBI) or (B) has any liability for the

SBI and each Subsidiary arising out of any intercompany transaction; and (C)
all material Tax elections that have been made by SBI or any of its
Subsidiaries.



(vii) The unpaid Taxes of SBI and its Subsidiaries (A) did not, as of the
most recent fiscal month end, exceed the reserve for Tax liability (not

differences between book and Tax income) set forth on the face of the most
recent financial statements of SBI and its Subsidiaries (other than in any
notes thereto) included in the SBI SEC Documents filed on or prior to the date
hereof (the "SBI Financial Statements") and (B) will not exceed that reserve
as of the Effective Date. Since the date of SBIs Financial Statements,
neither SBI nor any of its Subsidiaries has incurred any liability for Taxes
arising from extraordinary gains or losses, as that term is used in GAAP,
outside the ordinary course of their business consistent with past custom and
practice.

thereof) ending after the Effective Date as a result of any: (A) change in
method of accounting for a taxable period ending on or prior to the Effective

corresponding or similar provision of state, local or foreign income Tax law)

that was purported or intended to be governed in whole or in part by Code
Section 355 or Section 361.

or other arrangements or contracts to which SBI or any of its Subsidiaries is
a party that could be treated as a partnership for federal income Tax
purposes.

reason to believe that any conditions exist that might prevent or impede the
Merger from qualifying as a reorganization within the meaning of Section
368(a) of the Code.



(r) _Risk Management Instruments_. All material interest rate swaps, caps,
floors, option agreements, futures and forward contracts and other similar
risk management arrangements, whether entered into for SBIs own account, or
for the account of one or more of SBIs Subsidiaries or their customers (all
of which are listed on SBIs Disclosure Schedule), were entered into (i) in
accordance with prudent business practices and all applicable laws, rules,
regulations and regulatory policies and (ii) with counterparties believed to
be financially responsible at the time; and each of them constitutes the valid
and legally binding obligation of SBI or one of its Subsidiaries, enforceable

by applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium, fraudulent
transfer and similar laws of general applicability relating to or affecting
creditors rights or by general equity principles), and is in full force and
effect. Neither SBI nor its Subsidiaries, nor to SBIs knowledge any other

insurance policies, binders, or bonds maintained by SBI or its Subsidiaries.
SBI and its Subsidiaries are insured with reputable insurers against such
risks and in such amounts as the management of SBI reasonably has determined

suspension or cancellation of any of them is threatened; and



(iii) has received, since December 31, 2002, no notification or communication
from any Regulatory Authority or Governmental Authority (A) asserting that
Sky or any of its Subsidiaries is not in material compliance with any of the

have been fully, properly and accurately maintained in all material respects,

Subsidiaries or any officer or director of Sky



 

31 or any of its Subsidiaries has an economic or management interest. Section
5.04(q) of Skys Disclosure Schedule also sets forth a true and complete list
of all transactions, arrangements, and other relationships between or among

statements of Sky (each, a _"Sky Off Balance Sheet Transaction"_ ), along with
the following information with respect to each such Sky Off Balance Sheet
Transaction: (i) the business purpose, activities, and economic substance;
(ii) the key terms and conditions; (iii) the potential risk to Sky or any of
its Subsidiaries; (iv) the amount of any guarantee, line of credit,
standby letter of credit or commitment, or any other type of arrangement,
that could require Sky or any of its Subsidiaries to fund any obligations

floors, option agreements, futures and forward contracts and other similar
risk management arrangements, whether entered into for Skys own account, or
for the account of one or more of Skys Subsidiaries (or any entity acquired
by Sky) or their customers, were entered into (i) in accordance with prudent
business practices and all applicable laws, rules, regulations and regulatory
policies and (ii) with counterparties believed to be financially responsible
at the time; and each of them constitutes the valid and legally binding
obligation of Sky or one of its Subsidiaries, enforceable in accordance with
its terms (except as enforceability may be limited by applicable bankruptcy,
insolvency, reorganization, moratorium, fraudulent transfer and similar laws
of general applicability relating to or affecting creditors rights or by

Skys consolidated balance sheet as of September 30, 2003, included in the

of GAAP to provide for reasonably anticipated losses on outstanding loans, net
of recoveries.

Proxy Statement and any amendment or supplement thereto will, at the date of
mailing to the SBI shareholders and at the time of the SBI Meeting, as the

statements therein not misleading or any statement that, in the light of the
circumstances under which such statement is made, will be false or misleading

Statement or any amendment or supplement thereto. Each of SBI and Sky further

party thereof and to take the necessary steps to correct the Proxy Statement.

the time when the Registration Statement has become effective or any

purpose, or of any request by the SEC for the amendment or supplement of the
Registration Statement or for additional information.

advance notice thereof as is reasonably possible).



 

6.05 _Access; Confidentiality_.



(a) Each party shall, upon reasonable notice and subject to applicable laws
relating to the exchange of information, afford the other party and its
officers, employees, counsel, accountants and other authorized
representatives, such access during normal business hours throughout the
period prior to the Effective Time to the books, records (including, without
limitation, tax returns and work papers of independent auditors), properties,

6.05 (as well as any other information obtained prior to the date hereof in
connection with the entering into of this Agreement) for any purpose unrelated

Except for the use of information in connection with the Registration
Statement described in Section 6.03 hereof and any other governmental filings
required in order to complete the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, all information (collectively, the _"Information"_ ) received by
each of SBI and Sky, pursuant to the terms of this Agreement shall be kept in
strictest confidence; provided that, subsequent to the filing of the
Registration Statement with the SEC, this Section 6.05 shall not apply to
information included in the Registration Statement or to be included in the
Proxy Statement/Prospectus to be sent to the shareholders of SBI and Sky
under Section 6.03. Subject to the requirements of law, each party will keep
confidential, and will cause its representatives to keep confidential, all

Agreement) unless such Information (i) was already known to the party
receiving the information on a nonconfidential basis prior to the disclosure,

party to be bound by a confidentiality obligation, (iii) is disclosed with the
prior written



 

34 approval of the party to which such information pertains or (iv) is or becomes

event that this Agreement is terminated or the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement shall otherwise fail to be consummated, each party shall
promptly cause all copies of documents or extracts thereof containing
Information and data as to another party hereto to be returned to the party
that furnished the same. No investigation by either party of the business and
affairs of the other shall affect or be deemed to modify or waive
any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement in this Agreement, or the
conditions to either partys obligation to consummate the transactions

advisors and affiliates not to, solicit or encourage inquiries or proposals
with respect to, or engage in any negotiations concerning, or provide any
confidential information to, or have any discussions with, any person relating
to, any Acquisition Proposal, except to the extent that the SBI Board, after
consultation with independent legal counsel, determines in good faith that
the failure to take such action would constitute, or could reasonably be
expected to constitute, a breach of its fiduciary duties under applicable Ohio
or federal law and SBIs Articles. SBI shall immediately cease and cause to be
terminated any activities, discussions or negotiations conducted prior to the
date of this Agreement with any parties other than Sky with respect to any of
the foregoing and shall use its best efforts to enforce any confidentiality or
similar agreement relating to an Acquisition Proposal. SBI shall promptly

Affiliate"_ ) as that term is used in Rule 145 under the Securities Act. SBI

to be a SBI Affiliate to execute and deliver to SBI on or before the date of
mailing of the Proxy Statement an agreement in the form attached hereto as

35 necessary challenge the validity or applicability of, any applicable Takeover

practices so as to be applied on a basis that is consistent with that of Sky;
provided, however, that SBI shall not be obligated to take any such
action pursuant to this Section 6.09 earlier than 30 days prior to the
Effective Date, and unless and until Sky acknowledges that all conditions to
the obligations of Sky to consummate the Parent Merger have been satisfied and
certifies to SBI that Skys representations and warranties, subject to
Section 5.02, are true and correct as of such date and that Sky is otherwise
materially in compliance with this Agreement. SBIs representations,
warranties and covenants contained in this Agreement shall not be deemed to
be untrue or breached in any respect for any purpose as a consequence of any
modifications or changes undertaken solely on account of this Section 6.09.

Effective Date, Sky shall file a NASDAQ Notification Form for Listing of
Additional Shares and/or Change in the Number of Shares Outstanding, with

the right to review in advance, and to the extent practicable each will
consult with the other, in each case subject to applicable laws relating to
the exchange of information, with respect to, and shall be provided in advance
so as to reasonably exercise its right to review in advance, all material
written information submitted to any third party or any Governmental Authority
or Regulatory Authority in connection with the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement. In exercising the foregoing right, each of the parties
hereto agrees to act reasonably and as promptly as practicable. Each party
hereto agrees that it will consult with the other party hereto with respect to
the obtaining of all material permits, consents, approvals and authorizations

Agreement and each party will keep the other party apprised of the status of
material matters relating to completion of the transactions contemplated
hereby.

information concerning itself, its Subsidiaries, directors, officers and
shareholders and such other matters as may be reasonably necessary or
advisable in connection with any

of its Subsidiaries to any third party, Governmental Authority or Regulatory
Authority.



6.12 _Indemnification_.



(a) Following the Effective Date, Sky shall indemnify, defend and hold
harmless the present and former directors, officers and employees of SBI and
its Subsidiaries (each, an _"Indemnified Party"_ ) against all costs
or expenses (including reasonable attorneys fees), judgments, fines, losses,
claims, damages or liabilities incurred in connection with any claim, action,
suit, proceeding or investigation, whether civil, criminal, administrative
or investigative, arising out of actions or omissions occurring at or prior
to the Effective Time (including, without limitation, the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement) to the fullest extent that SBI is permitted to
indemnify (and advance expenses to) its directors, officers, and employees
under the laws of the State of Ohio, the SBI Articles or the SBI Code as in
effect on the date hereof; provided that any determination required to be made
with respect to whether an officers, directors or employees conduct
complies with the standards set forth under Ohio law, the SBI Articles or the
SBI Code shall be made by independent counsel (which shall not be counsel that
provides material services to Sky) selected by Sky and reasonably acceptable
to such officer, director or employee.



(b) For a period of three (3) years from the Effective Time, Sky shall use its
reasonable best efforts to provide that portion of directors and officers
liability insurance that serves to reimburse the present and former officers
and directors of SBI or any of its Subsidiaries (determined as of the
Effective Time) (as opposed to SBI) with respect to claims against such
directors and officers arising from facts or events that occurred before
the Effective Time; provided, however, that in no event shall Sky be required
to expend more than 125% of the current amount expended by SBI to maintain or
procure such directors and officers insurance.



(c) Any Indemnified Party wishing to claim indemnification under Section
6.12(a), upon learning of any claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation
described above, shall promptly notify Sky thereof; provided that the failure
so to notify shall not affect the obligations of Sky under Section
6.12(a) unless and to the extent that Sky is actually prejudiced as a result
of such failure.



(d) If Sky or any of its successors or assigns shall consolidate with or merge
into any other entity and shall not be the continuing or surviving entity of
such consolidation or merger or shall transfer all or substantially all of its
assets to any entity, then and in each case, proper provision shall be made so
that the successors and assigns of Sky shall assume the obligations set forth
in this Section 6.12.



6.13 _Opportunity of Employment; Employee Benefits_.



(a) Sky will make a good faith effort to provide the existing employees of
SBI with the opportunity to continue as employees on the Effective Date,
subject, however, to the right of Sky and its Subsidiaries, and the Bank, to
terminate any such employees (i) for cause; or (ii) pursuant to procedures
set forth in the Sky workforce redesign process;



 

37 or (iii) pursuant to the implementation of Skys regional banking template; or
(iv) to eliminate the redundancy of employment positions. Prior to the
Effective Time, pursuant to and in accordance with specific directions from
Sky, SBI agrees to issue, and cause the Bank to issue, Worker Adjustment and
Retraining Act notices (so-called WARN notices) to employees of SBI and the
Bank who Sky determines will not be employed on or after the Effective Time
pursuant to the employment termination provisions of the foregoing sentence;
provided, however, that any such WARN notices shall be (aa) for employment
terminations on or after the Effective Time, and (bb) given to affected
employees at least sixty (60) days in advance of their termination dates. It
is understood and agreed that nothing in this Section 6.13 or elsewhere in
this Agreement shall be deemed to be a contract of employment or be construed
to give said employees any rights other than as employees at will under
applicable law and said employees shall not be deemed to be third-party
beneficiaries of this provision. Each existing SBI employee who is terminated
by SBI (with Skys prior written consent) or Sky or one of their Subsidiaries
(which shall include the Bank commencing on the Effective Date) at any time
until the end of the first whole year following the Effective Date shall be
entitled to all benefits payable by Sky in accordance with Skys standard
severance policy for employees (excluding any retention payments thereunder),
with credit for years of SBI service (including years of service with SBIs
predecessors, including any entities merged into SBI or Bank with respect to
which service no prior severance payments were made to such employees) and
reduced (but not below zero) by any amounts payable to such employees
under SBIs severance compensation program; and Sky also shall pay each such
terminated employee for all unused vacation time based upon each such
terminated employees years of service as of the date of termination of
employment, up to maximum of one years vacation time.



(b) From and after the Effective Time, SBI employees shall continue to
participate in the SBI employee benefit plans in effect at the Effective Time
unless and until Sky, in its sole discretion, shall determine that SBI
employees shall, subject to applicable eligibility requirements, participate
in employee benefit plans of Sky, and that all or some of the SBI plans shall
be frozen, terminated or merged into certain employee benefit plans of Sky.
SBI employees continuing to be employed by Sky shall receive credit for
service at SBI for eligibility and vesting purposes under Skys employee
benefit plans (but not for benefit calculation purposes), except as otherwise
required by law or regulation. Any employees terminated by Sky shall
be entitled to elect so-called "COBRA" in accordance with, and subject to,
the provisions of Code Section 4980B(f). Each SBI employee shall be credited
with years of SBI service (including years of service with SBIs predecessors,
to the same extent that SBI credited such service, including any entities
merged into SBI or Bank) for purposes of eligibility and vesting in the
employee benefit plans of Sky, and shall not be subject to any exclusion or
penalty for pre-existing conditions that were covered under SBIs welfare
plans immediately prior to the Effective Date, or to any waiting period
relating to such coverage. If, after the Effective Date, Sky adopts a new plan
or program for its employees or executives, then to the extent its employees
or executives receive past service credits for any reason, Sky shall credit
similarly-situated employees and executives of SBI with equivalent credit for
service with SBI or its predecessors (including any entities merged into SBI
or Bank), to the same extent that SBI credited service with its predecessors.



(c) The covenants of this Section 6.13 shall survive the Merger.



 

38 6.14 _Notification of Certain Matters_. Each of SBI and Sky shall give prompt
notice to the other of any fact, event or circumstance known to it that (i)
is reasonably likely, individually or taken together with all other facts,
events and circumstances known to it, to result in any Material Adverse Effect
with respect to it or (ii) would cause or constitute a material breach of any
of its representations, warranties, covenants or agreements contained herein.



6.15 _Dividend Coordination._ It is agreed by the parties hereto that they
will cooperate to assure that as a result of the Parent Merger, during any
applicable period, there shall not be a payment of both a Sky and a SBI
dividend for SBI shareholders and, in no event, will the selection of the
Effective Date cause the SBI shareholders to lose a quarterly dividend to
which they are otherwise entitled.



6.16 _Tax Matters_. 



(i) Without the prior written consent of Sky, neither SBI nor any of its
Subsidiaries shall make or change any election, change an annual accounting
period, adopt or change any accounting method, file any amended Tax Return,
enter into any closing agreement, settle any Tax claim or assessment relating
to SBI or any of its Subsidiaries, surrender any right to claim a refund of
Taxes, consent to any extension or waiver of the limitation period applicable
to any Tax claim or assessment relating to SBI or any of its Subsidiaries, or
take any other similar action relating to the filing of any Tax Return or the
payment of any Tax, if such election, adoption, change, amendment, agreement,
settlement, surrender, consent or other action would have the effect of
increasing the Tax liability of SBI or any of its Subsidiaries for any period
ending after the Effective Date or decreasing any Tax attribute of SBI or any
of its Subsidiaries existing on the Effective Date.



(ii) Each of Sky and SBI agrees not to take any actions subsequent to the date
if this Agreement that would adversely affect the ability of SBI and its
shareholders to characterize the Merger as a tax-free reorganization under
Section 368(a) of the Code, and each of Sky and SBI agrees to take such action
as may be reasonably required, if such action may be reasonably taken to
reverse the impact of past actions which would adversely impact the ability of
the Merger to be characterized as a tax-free reorganization under Section
368(a) of the Code.



6.17 _No Breaches of Representations and Warranties_. Between the date of
this Agreement and the Effective Time, without the written consent of the
other party, each of Sky and SBI will not do any act or suffer any omission of
any nature whatsoever that would cause any of the representations or
warranties made in Article V of this Agreement to become untrue or incorrect
in any material respect.



6.18 _Consents_. Each of Sky and SBI shall use its reasonable best efforts to
obtain any required consents to the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement.



6.19 _Insurance Coverage_. SBI shall cause the policies of insurance listed
in the Disclosure Schedule to remain in effect between the date of this
Agreement and the Effective Date.



 

39 6.20 _Correction of Information_. Each of Sky and SBI shall promptly correct
and supplement any information furnished under this Agreement so that such
information shall be correct and complete in all material respects at all
times, and shall include all facts necessary to make such information correct
and complete in all material respects at all times; provided that no such
corrections or supplementations by either party shall be deemed to either (i)
amend any of the representations or warranties contained herein by, or the
Disclosure Schedule of, that party or (ii) impair the right of either party
to declare the other party to be in breach of any of its representations or
warranties for purposes of Section 8.01(b) of this Agreement.



6.21 _Supplemental Assurances_.



(a) On the date the Registration Statement becomes effective and on the
Effective Date, SBI shall deliver to Sky a certificate signed by its
principal executive officer and its principal financial officer to the effect,
to such officers knowledge, that the information contained in the
Registration Statement relating to the business and financial condition and
affairs of SBI, does not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or
omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to
make the statements therein not misleading.



(b) On the date the Registration Statement becomes effective and on the
Effective Date, Sky shall deliver to SBI a certificate signed by its chief
executive officer and its chief financial officer to the effect, to such
officers knowledge, that the Registration Statement (other than the
information contained therein relating to the business and financial
condition and affairs of SBI) does not contain any untrue statement of a
material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein
or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading.



6.22 _Regulatory Matters_. Sky, SBI and each of their Subsidiaries shall
cooperate and each of them agrees to use its reasonable best efforts to
remediate any order, decree, agreement, memorandum of understanding or similar
agreement by SBI or any of its Subsidiaries with, or a commitment letter,
board resolution or similar submission by SBI or any of its Subsidiaries to,
or supervisory letter from any Regulatory Authority to SBI or any of its
Subsidiaries, to the satisfaction of such Regulatory Authority.



6.23 _Election of Sky Board Member_. Sky shall select and propose to the
Nominating Committee of the Sky Board one member of either the existing SBI
Board or the Board of Directors of Bank. At the Effective Time, the director
selected and nominated pursuant to this Section 6.23 shall be elected or
appointed to fill a vacancy on the Sky Board.



6.24 _Liquidity Ratio_. From the date hereof until the Effective Time, SBI
shall maintain a Liquidity Ratio equal to or greater than 4.3%. As used
herein, Liquidity Ratio shall mean (i) the sum of cash and due from banks,
Federal Funds sold, unencumbered securities issued by the U.S. government and
any government-sponsored enterprises, divided by (ii) the difference between

ARTICLE VIII



Termination



8.01 _Termination_. This Agreement may be terminated, and the Acquisition may
be abandoned:



(a) _Mutual Consent._ At any time prior to the Effective Time, by the mutual
consent of Sky and SBI, if the Board of Directors of each so determines by
vote of a majority of the members of its entire Board.



(b) _Breach._ At any time prior to the Effective Time, by Sky or SBI, if its
Board of Directors so determines by vote of a majority of the members of its
entire Board, in the event of either: (i) a breach by the other party of any
representation or warranty contained herein (subject to the standard set forth
in Section 5.02), which breach cannot be or has not been cured within 30 days
after the giving of written notice to the breaching party of such breach; or
(ii) a breach by the other party of any of the covenants or agreements
contained herein, which breach cannot be or has not been cured within 30 days
after the giving of written notice to the breaching party of such breach,
provided that such breach (whether under (i) or (ii)) would be reasonably
likely, individually or in the aggregate with other breaches, to result in a
Material Adverse Effect. In the event of a breach by SBI of any
representation, warranty, covenant or agreement contained herein, which
breach cannot be or has not been cured within 30 days after giving written
notice to SBI of such breach pursuant to this



 

43 Section 8.01(b) and which breach would otherwise give Sky the right to
terminate this Agreement under this Section 8.01(b), Sky, at its option, in
lieu of terminating this Agreement pursuant to this Section 8.01(b), may agree
to an adjustment of the Exchange Ratio by an amount that is mutually
acceptable to the Sky Board and the SBI Board. 



(c) _Delay._ At any time prior to the Effective Time, by Sky or SBI, if its
Board of Directors so determines by vote of a majority of the members of its
entire Board, in the event that the Merger is not consummated by September 30,
2004, except to the extent that the failure of the Merger then to be
consummated arises out of or results from the knowing action or inaction of
the party seeking to terminate pursuant to this Section 8.01(c).



 

(d) _No Approval._ By SBI or Sky, if its Board of Directors so determines by a
vote of a majority of the members of its entire Board, in the event (i) the
approval of any Governmental Authority or any of the Regulatory Authorities
required for consummation of the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement shall have been denied by final
nonappealable action of such Governmental Authority or Regulatory Authority;
(ii) the SBI shareholders fail to adopt this Agreement at the SBI Meeting; or
(iii) any of the conditions precedent to the obligations of the other party to
consummate the transactions contemplated hereby cannot be satisfied or
fulfilled prior to the planned Effective Date set pursuant to Section 2.04 of
this Agreement.



(e) _Sky Common Shares._ By SBI, in the event that:



(i) the Average NMS Closing Price (as defined below) of Sky Common Shares is
less than $20.98; _and_  



(ii) (A) the number obtained by dividing the Average NMS Closing Price of Sky
Common Shares by $26.23 is less than (B) the number obtained by dividing the
Final Index Price (as defined below) by the Initial Index Price (as defined
below) and then multiplying the quotient in this clause (B) by .80.



For purposes of this Section 8.01(e), the following terms have the meanings
indicated below:



_"Average NMS Closing Price"_ shall mean the arithmetic mean of the NMS
Closing Prices for the ten trading days immediately preceding the fifth
trading day prior to the receipt of final federal regulatory approval of
the Merger.



_"Final Index Price"_  means the sum of the Final Prices for each company
comprising the Index Group multiplied by the appropriate weight.



_"Final Price,"_ with respect to any company belonging to the Index Group,
means the arithmetic mean of the daily closing sales prices of a share of
common stock of such company, as reported on the consolidated transaction
reporting system for the market or exchange on which such common stock is
principally traded, for the same ten trading days used in calculating
the Average NMS Closing Price of Sky Common Shares (i.e., the valuation
date).



_"Index Group"_ means the 21 financial institution holding companies listed on
_Exhibit B_ attached hereto, the common stock of all of which shall be
publicly



 

44 traded and as to which there shall not have been a publicly announced proposal
at any time during the period beginning on the date of the Agreement and
ending on the valuation date for any such company to be acquired. In the event
that the common stock of any such company ceases to be publicly traded or a
proposal to acquire any such company is announced at any time during the
period beginning on the date of this Agreement and ending on the valuation
date, such company will be removed from the Index Group, and the weights
attributed to the remaining companies will be adjusted proportionately for
purposes of determining the Final Index Price and the Initial Index Price. The
21 financial institution holding companies and the weights attributed to them
are listed on _Exhibit B_ attached hereto.



_"Initial Index Price"_ means the sum of each per share closing price of the
common stock of each company comprising the Index Group multiplied by the
applicable weighting, as such prices are reported on the consolidated
transactions reporting system for the market or exchange on which such common
stock is principally traded, on the trading day immediately preceding the
public announcement of the Agreement.



_"NMS Closing Price"_ shall mean the price per share of the last sale of Sky
Common Shares reported on the NASDAQ National Market System at the close of
the trading day by the NASD.



Prior to SBI exercising its right of termination under this Section 8.01(e),
in the event that both of the conditions specified in Sections 8.01(e)(i) and
(ii) are met, Sky may, at its option (the _"Fill Option"_ ), for a period of
ten business days commencing on the date the parties determine the conditions
have been met, offer to distribute to SBIs shareholders, in connection with
the Merger Consideration, the number of shares of Sky Common Shares necessary
for the Exchange Ratio to equal $26.44 divided by the Average NMS Closing
Price of Sky Common Shares (the "Fill Offer"). Thereafter, for a period of ten
business days, SBI shall have the opportunity to accept or reject the Fill
Offer. If SBI elects to accept the Fill Offer, SBI shall provide written
notice of its acceptance to Sky, whereupon no termination shall have occurred
pursuant to this Section 8.01(e) and this Agreement shall remain in effect
in accordance with its terms, except that the Merger Consideration shall have
been so adjusted and any references in this Agreement to "Merger
Consideration" and "Exchange Ratio" shall thereafter be deemed to refer to the
Merger Consideration and Exchange Ratio after giving to any adjustment made
pursuant to this Section 8.01(e). If SBI rejects the Fill Offer, SBI may
terminate this Agreement in accordance with the provisions hereof. In the
event Sky determines not to exercise the Fill Option, it will so advise SBI
in writing, and thereafter, for a period of three business days SBI may
exercise its right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this Section
8.01(e).



If Sky or any company belonging to the Index Group declares or effects a
stock dividend, reclassification, recapitalization, split-up, combination,
exchange of shares or similar transaction between the date of the Agreement
and the valuation date, the prices for the common stock of such company will
be appropriately adjusted.



(f) _Other Transactions_. By SBI or by Sky, in the event that SBI receives an
Acquisition Proposal pursuant to Section 6.06 hereof and enters into an
agreement with



 

45 respect to such Acquisition Proposal, subject however, to the payment by SBI
of the termination fee specified in Section 8.03 hereof.



8.02 _Effect of Termination and Abandonment; Enforcement of Agreement_. In
the event of termination of this Agreement and the abandonment of the Merger
pursuant to this Article VIII, no party to this Agreement shall have any
liability or further obligation to any other party hereunder except (i) as
set forth in Sections 8.03 and 9.01; and (ii) that termination will not
relieve a breaching party from liability for any breach of this Agreement
giving rise to such termination. Notwithstanding anything contained herein to
the contrary, the parties hereto agree that irreparable damage will occur in
the event that a party breaches any of its obligations, duties, covenants and
agreements contained herein. It is accordingly agreed that the parties shall
be entitled to an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches or threatened
breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and
provisions of this Agreement in any court of the United States or any state
having jurisdiction, this being in addition to any other remedy to which they
are entitled by law or in equity.



8.03 _Termination Fee_. SBI shall pay to Sky a termination fee in the amount
of 4% of the aggregate value of the transaction if:



(a) (x) this Agreement is terminated by Sky pursuant to Section 8.01(b)(ii) or
by Sky or SBI pursuant to Section 8.01(d)(ii); (y) after the date hereof and
prior to any such termination, an Acquisition Proposal (including an
Acquisition Proposal from a party that has previously made an Acquisition
Proposal to SBI) with respect to SBI was commenced, publicly proposed or
publicly disclosed; and (z) within 18 months after such termination, SBI shall
have entered into an agreement relating to an Acquisition Proposal or any
Acquisition Proposal shall have been consummated; or



(b) after receiving an Acquisition Proposal, the SBI Board does not take
action within the time period set forth in Section 8.01(c) to convene the SBI
Meeting and recommend that SBI shareholders adopt this Agreement; and within
18 months after such receipt, SBI shall have entered into an agreement
relating to an Acquisition Proposal or any Acquisition Proposal shall have
been consummated.



Upon payment of the fee described in this Section 8.03, SBI shall have no
further liability to Sky at law or in equity with respect to such termination
under Section 8.01(b)(ii) or 8.01(d)(ii), or with respect to this Agreement.



8.04 _Force Majeure_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this
Agreement, in the event this Agreement is terminated as a result of a failure
of a condition, which failure is due to a natural disaster or other act of
God, or an act of war or terrorism, and provided no party has failed to
observe the material obligations of such party under this Agreement, no party
shall be obligated to pay to the other party to this Agreement any fees
or expenses or otherwise be liable hereunder.

_Form of SBI Affiliate Agreement_



_ _, 2004



Sky Financial Group, Inc.

221 South Church Street

Bowling Green, OH 43402



Ladies and Gentlemen:



I have been advised that as of the date hereof I may be deemed to be an
"affiliate" of Second Bancorp, Incorporated ("SBI"), as that term is defined
for purposes of Paragraphs (c) and (d) of Rule 145 of the Rules and
Regulations (the "Rules and Regulations") of the Securities and Exchange
Commission (the "Commission") promulgated under the Securities Act of 1933, as
amended (the "Act").



Pursuant to the terms of the Agreement and Plan of Merger by and between Sky
Financial Group, Inc. ("Sky") and SBI dated as of January 8, 2004 (the
"Merger Agreement"), providing for the merger of SBI with and into Sky (the
"Merger"), and as a result of the Merger, I may receive Sky common shares
("Sky Common Shares") in exchange for SBI common shares ("SBI Common Shares")
owned by me at the Effective Time (as defined and determined pursuant to the
Merger Agreement). This letter is being delivered pursuant to Section 6.07 of
the Merger Agreement. I represent and warrant to Sky that in such event:



A. I will not sell, assign or transfer the Sky Common Shares that I receive
as aforesaid in violation of the Act or the Rules and Regulations.



B. I have carefully read this letter and the Merger Agreement and have
discussed their requirements and other applicable limitations upon my ability
to sell, transfer or otherwise dispose of the Sky Common Shares, to the
extent I feel necessary, with my counsel or counsel for SBI. I understand that
Sky is relying on the representations I am making in this letter and I hereby
agree to hold harmless and indemnify Sky and its officers and directors from
and against any losses, claims, damages, expenses (including reasonable
attorneys fees), or liabilities ("Losses") to which Sky or any officer or
director of Sky may become subject under the Act or otherwise as a result of
the untruth, breach, or failure of such representations.



C. I have been advised that the issuance of the Sky Financial Common Shares
issued to me pursuant to the Merger will have been registered with
the Commission under the Act on a Registration Statement on Form S-4.
However, I have also been advised that since I may be deemed to be an
affiliate under the Rules and Regulations at the time the Merger was submitted
for a vote of the shareholders of SBI, that the Sky Common Shares must be
held by me indefinitely unless (i) my subsequent distribution of Sky Common
Shares has been registered



 

A-1 under the Act; (ii) a sale of the Sky Common Shares is made in conformity with
the volume and other applicable limitations of a transaction permitted by
Rule 145 promulgated by the Commission under the Act and as to which Sky has
received satisfactory evidence of the compliance and conformity with said
Rule, or (iii) a transaction in which, in the opinion of Squire, Sanders and
Dempsey L.L.P. (or other counsel reasonably acceptable to Sky) or in
accordance with a no-action letter from the Commission, some other exemption
from registration is available with respect to any such proposed sale,
transfer or other disposition of the Sky Common Shares.



D. I also understand that stop transfer instructions will be given to Skys
transfer agent with respect to any Sky Common Shares that I receive in the
Merger and that there will be placed on the certificates for such Sky Common
Shares, a legend stating in substance:



"The shares represented by this certificate have been issued or transferred
to the registered holder as a result of a transaction to which Rule 145 under
the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "Act"), applies. The shares
represented by this certificate may not be sold, transferred or assigned, and
the issuer shall not be required to give effect to any attempted sale,
transfer or assignment, except pursuant to (i) an effective registration
statement under the Act, (ii) a transaction permitted by Rule 145 and as to
which the issuer has received reasonable and satisfactory evidence of
compliance with the provisions of Rule 145, or (iii) a transaction in which,
in the opinion of Squire, Sanders and Dempsey L.L.P. or other counsel
satisfactory to the issuer or in accordance with a "no action" letter from
the staff of the Securities and Exchange Commission, such shares are not
required to be registered under the Act."



It is understood and agreed that the legend set forth in Paragraph D above
shall be promptly removed and any stop order instructions with respect
thereto shall be canceled upon receipt of advice from Squire, Sanders and
Dempsey L.L.P., or other counsel satisfactory to Sky, that such actions are
appropriate under the then-existing circumstances. Such advice of Squire,
Sanders and Dempsey L.L.P. shall be given promptly at no cost to such affiliate,
upon receipt of reasonably satisfactory evidence of compliance with Rule 145.
