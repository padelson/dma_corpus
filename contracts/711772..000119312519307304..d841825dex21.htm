ARTICLE I

 

THE MERGER

 

Section 1.01 _Terms of the Merger_. Subject to the terms and conditions of
this Agreement, at the Effective Time, Wellesley shall merge with and into
Cambridge, and Cambridge shall be the surviving entity (hereinafter sometimes
referred to as the "Surviving Company"). Immediately thereafter, pursuant to
the Plan of Bank Merger described in the following sentence, Wellesley Bank
shall merge with and into Cambridge Trust, and Cambridge Trust shall be the
surviving entity (hereinafter sometimes referred to as the "Surviving Bank")
and shall continue to be governed by the laws of the Commonwealth
of Massachusetts. As soon as practicable after the execution of this
Agreement (or on such later date as Cambridge shall specify), Cambridge will
cause Cambridge Trust to, and Wellesley will cause Wellesley Bank to, execute
and deliver a Plan of Bank Merger substantially in the form attached to this
Agreement as _Exhibit D_. As part of the Merger, shares of Wellesley Stock
shall, at the Effective Time, be converted into the right to receive the
Merger Consideration pursuant to the terms of  _Article II_.

Section 1.02 _Tax Consequences_. It is intended that the Merger shall
constitute a reorganization within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code,
and that this Agreement shall constitute a "plan of reorganization" as that
term is used in Sections 354, 361 and 368 of the Code. From and after the date
of this Agreement and until the Closing, each party hereto shall use its
reasonable best efforts to cause the Merger to qualify, and will not knowingly
take any action, cause any action to be taken, fail to take any action or
cause any action to fail to be taken, which action or failure to act would
reasonably be expected to prevent the Merger from qualifying as a
reorganization under Section 368(a) of the Code. Wellesley and Cambridge each
hereby agree to deliver a certificate substantially in compliance with
IRS published advance ruling guidelines, with customary exceptions and
modifications thereto, to enable its counsel to deliver the legal opinions
contemplated by _ Section 6.01(e)_.

 

Section 1.03 _Name of the Surviving Bank_. The name of the Surviving Company
shall be "Cambridge Bancorp." The name of the Surviving Bank shall be

ARTICLE II

 

CONSIDERATION; EXCHANGE PROCEDURES

 

Section 2.01 _Merger Consideration_. Subject to the provisions of this
Agreement, at the Effective Time, automatically by virtue of the Merger and
without any action on the part of any Person:

(a) Each share of Cambridge Stock that is issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall remain outstanding following
the Effective Time and shall be unchanged by the Merger.

(b) All remaining shares of Wellesley Stock issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than treasury stock) shall
become and be converted into, as provided in and subject to the limitations
set forth in this Agreement, the right to receive 0.580 shares (the "Exchange
Ratio") of Cambridge Stock (the "Merger Consideration").

Section 2.02 _Rights as Shareholders; Stock Transfers_. All shares of
Wellesley Stock, when converted as provided in _Section_ __ _ 2.01(b)_, shall
no longer be outstanding and shall automatically be cancelled and retired and
shall cease to exist, and each certificate (a "Certificate") previously
evidencing such shares shall thereafter represent only the right to receive
for each such share of Wellesley Stock, the Merger Consideration and, if
applicable, any cash in lieu of fractional shares of Cambridge Stock in
accordance with _Section_ __ _ 2.03_. At the Effective Time, holders of the
Wellesley Stock shall cease to be, and shall have no rights as, shareholders
of Wellesley other than the right to receive the Merger Consideration and
cash in lieu of fractional shares of Cambridge Stock as provided under this
_Article II_. After the Effective Time, there shall be no transfers on the
stock transfer books of Wellesley of shares of the Wellesley Stock. 

Section 2.03 _No Fractional Shares_. Notwithstanding any other provision
hereof, no fractional shares of Cambridge Stock and no certificates or scrip
therefor, or other evidence of ownership thereof, will be issued in the
Merger. In lieu thereof, Cambridge shall pay to each holder of a fractional
share of Cambridge Stock an amount of cash (without interest) determined
by multiplying the fractional share interest to which such holder would
otherwise be entitled by the average of the daily closing prices during the
regular session of Cambridge Stock as reported on NASDAQ for the five (5)
consecutive trading days ending on the third Business Day immediately prior
to the Closing Date, rounded to the nearest whole cent (the "Cambridge
Measurement Price"). No such holder shall be entitled to dividends, voting
rights or any other rights in respect of any fractional share.

Section 2.04 _Exchange of Certificates; Payment of the Consideration_.

 

(a) Until the six (6) month anniversary of the Effective Time, Cambridge shall
make available on a timely basis or cause to be made available to the
Exchange Agent the following: (i) certificates, or at Cambridges option,
evidence of shares in book entry form, representing the shares of Cambridge
Stock, sufficient to pay the aggregate Merger Consideration required pursuant
to this _Article II_ , and (ii) an aggregate amount of cash sufficient to pay
the estimated amount of cash to be paid in lieu of fractional shares of
Cambridge Stock, each to be given to the holders of Wellesley Stock in
exchange for Certificates pursuant to this _Article II_. Upon such six (6)
month anniversary, any such cash or certificates remaining in the possession
of the Exchange Agent, together with any earnings in respect thereof, shall be
delivered to Cambridge. Any holder of Certificates who has not theretofore
exchanged his or her Certificates for the Merger Consideration pursuant to
this _Article II_ who has not theretofore submitted a letter of transmittal
shall thereafter be entitled to look exclusively to Cambridge, and only as a
general creditor thereof, for the Merger Consideration, as applicable, to
which he or she may be entitled upon exchange of such Certificates, as
applicable, pursuant to this _Article II_. If outstanding Certificates are
not surrendered, or the payment for the Certificates, as applicable, is not
claimed prior to the date on which such payment would otherwise escheat to or
become the property of any Governmental Authority, the unclaimed items shall,
to the extent permitted by abandoned property and any other applicable law,
become the property of Cambridge (and to the extent not in its possession
shall be delivered to it), free and clear of all Liens of any Person
previously entitled to such property.

 



4

    

 Neither the Exchange Agent nor any of the parties hereto shall be liable to
any holder of Wellesley Stock represented by any Certificate for any
consideration paid to a public official pursuant to applicable abandoned
property, escheat or similar laws. Cambridge and the Exchange Agent shall be
entitled to rely upon the stock transfer books of Wellesley to establish the
identity of those Persons entitled to receive the Merger Consideration, which
books shall be conclusive with respect thereto.

(b) The Exchange Agent or Cambridge shall be entitled to deduct and withhold
from the Merger Consideration otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement to
any holder of Certificates, as applicable, such amounts as it is required to
deduct and withhold with respect to the making of such payment under the Code,
or any provision of state, local or foreign tax law. To the extent that
amounts are so withheld by the Exchange Agent or Cambridge such withheld
amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been
paid to the holder of the Certificates in respect of which such deduction and
withholding was made.

(c) Promptly after the Effective Time, but in no event later than five (5)
Business Days thereafter, Cambridge shall cause the Exchange Agent to mail or
deliver to each Person who was, immediately prior to the Effective Time, a
holder of record of Wellesley Stock notice advising such holders of the
effectiveness of the Merger, including a form of letter of transmittal in a
form satisfactory to Cambridge and Wellesley containing instructions for use
in effecting the surrender of Certificates in exchange for the Merger
Consideration which shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk
of loss and title to Certificates or book-entry shares ("Book-Entry Shares")
shall pass, only upon (i) with respect to shares evidenced by Certificates,
proper delivery of such Certificates to the Exchange Agent, proper delivery
of the Certificates and the transmittal materials, duly, completely and
validly executed in accordance with the instructions thereto, and (ii) with
respect to Book-Entry Shares, proper delivery of an "agents message"
regarding the book-entry transfer of Book-Entry Shares (or such other evidence
(if any) of the transfer as the Exchange Agent may reasonably request). Upon
surrender to the Exchange Agent of a Certificate or Book-Entry Shares
for cancellation together with such letter of transmittal, duly executed and
completed in accordance with the instructions thereto, the holder of such
Certificate or Book-Entry Shares shall promptly be provided in exchange
therefor, but in no event later than five (5) Business Days after due
surrender, a certificate, or at the election of Cambridge, a statement
reflecting shares issued in book-entry form, representing the Merger
Consideration to which such holder is entitled pursuant to this _Article II_
, plus a check for any amounts due pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 2.03_ above and
any dividends or other distributions to which such holder is entitled pursuant
to _Section_ __ _ 2.04(e)_, and the Certificate or Book-Entry Share so
surrendered shall forthwith be canceled. No interest will accrue or be paid
with respect to any property to be delivered upon surrender of Certificates or
Book-Entry Shares.

 

(d) If any certificate representing shares of Cambridge Stock is to be issued
in the name of other than the registered holder of the Certificate
surrendered in exchange therefore, it shall be a condition of the issuance
thereof that the Certificate so surrendered shall be properly endorsed (or
accompanied by an appropriate instrument of transfer) and otherwise in proper
form for transfer, and that the Person requesting such exchange shall pay to
the Exchange Agent in advance any transfer or other taxes required by reason
of the issuance of a certificate representing shares of Cambridge Stock in a
name other than that of the registered holder of the Certificate surrendered,
or required for any other reason relating to such holder or requesting Person,
or shall establish to the reasonable satisfaction of the Exchange Agent that
such tax has been paid or is not payable. 

(e) No dividends or other distributions with a record date after the Effective
Time with respect to Cambridge Stock shall be paid to the holder of any
unsurrendered Certificate or Book-Entry Shares until the holder thereof shall
surrender such Certificate or Book-Entry Shares in accordance with this
_Article II_. After the surrender of a Certificate or Book-Entry Shares
in accordance with this _Article II_ , the recordholder thereof shall be
entitled to receive any such dividends or other distributions, without any
interest thereon, which theretofore had become payable with respect to shares
of Cambridge Stock. 

(f) If any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the
making of an affidavit of that fact by the Person claiming such Certificate
to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if required by the Surviving Company or
the Exchange Agent, the posting by such Person of a bond in such reasonable
amount as the Surviving Company or the Exchange Agent may direct as
indemnity against any claim that may be made against it with respect to such
Certificate, the Surviving Company or the Exchange Agent shall, in exchange
for such lost, stolen or

 



5

    

 destroyed Certificate, pay or cause to be paid the Merger Consideration
deliverable in respect of the shares of Wellesley Stock formerly represented
by such Certificate pursuant to this  _Article II_. In the event of a dispute
with respect to ownership of any shares of Wellesley Stock represented by any
Certificate or Book-Entry Share, Cambridge and the Exchange Agent shall be
entitled to deposit any Merger Consideration represented thereby in escrow
with an independent third party and thereafter be relieved with respect to any
claims thereto.

 

Section 2.05 _Anti-Dilution Provisions_. In the event Cambridge or Wellesley
changes (or establishes a record date for changing) the number of, or
provides for the exchange of, shares of Cambridge Stock or Wellesley Stock
issued and outstanding prior to the Effective Time as a result of a stock
split, stock dividend, recapitalization, reclassification, or similar
transaction with respect to the outstanding Cambridge Stock or Wellesley
Stock and the record date therefor shall be prior to the Effective Time, the
Exchange Ratio shall be proportionately and appropriately adjusted; _provided_
, _however_ , that, for the avoidance of doubt, no such adjustment shall be
made with regard to Cambridge Stock if (a) Cambridge issues additional shares
of Cambridge Stock and receives consideration for such shares in a bona fide
third party transaction, (b) Cambridge issues additional shares of Cambridge
Stock under its Employee Stock Incentive Plans, or (c) Cambridge grants
employee or director stock grants or similar equity awards or shares of
Cambridge Stock upon the exercise or settlement thereof.

Section 2.06 _Reservation of Shares_. Effective upon the date of this
Agreement, Cambridge shall reserve for issuance a sufficient number of shares
of the Cambridge Stock for the purpose of issuing shares of Cambridge Stock to
Wellesley shareholders in accordance with this _Article II_.

 

Section 2.07 _Listing of Additional Shares_. Prior to the Effective Time,
Cambridge shall notify NASDAQ of the additional shares of Cambridge Stock to
be issued by Cambridge in exchange for the shares of Wellesley Stock.

Section 2.08 _Treatment of Stock Options_.

(a) Effective as of the Effective Time, each Wellesley Option, whether vested
or unvested, that is outstanding as of immediately prior to the Effective
Time, shall be cancelled and automatically converted into the right to receive
a cash payment from Wellesley equal to (i) the number of shares of Wellesley
Stock subject to such Wellesley Option at the Effective Time, multiplied by
(ii) the amount by which the Per Share Consideration exceeds the per share
exercise price of such Wellesley Option, less applicable taxes and
withholdings and without interest. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the per
share exercise price for an Wellesley Option is equal to or in excess of the
Per Share Consideration, such Wellesley Option shall be cancelled at the
Effective Time in exchange for no consideration. For the avoidance of doubt,
Cambridge shall not assume any Wellesley Options.

(b) Prior to the Effective Time, Wellesley shall take all actions that may be
necessary or required (under any Wellesley Equity Plan, any applicable law,
the applicable award agreements or otherwise) (i) to effectuate the provisions
of this _Section_ __ _ 2.08_, (ii) to terminate each Wellesley Equity Plan as
of the Effective Time without any further obligation or liability and (iii)
to ensure that, from and after the Effective Time, holders of Wellesley
Options shall have no rights with respect to thereto other than those rights
specifically provided in  _Section_ __ _ 2.08(a)_.

Section 2.09 _Treatment of Restricted Stock Awards_. At the Effective Time,
any vesting restrictions on each share of restricted stock outstanding
immediately prior thereto ("Wellesley Restricted Stock") pursuant to the
Wellesley Equity Plans shall automatically lapse, and each share of Wellesley
Restricted Stock shall be treated as an issued and outstanding share of
Wellesley Stock for the purposes of this Agreement.

Wellesley or Wellesley Bank under Section 4001 of ERISA or Section 414 of the
Code (a "Wellesley ERISA Affiliate"). Wellesley has not incurred, and does
not expect to incur, any withdrawal liability with respect to a multiemployer
plan under Subtitle E of Title IV of ERISA (regardless of whether based on
contributions of an Wellesley ERISA Affiliate). No notice of a "reportable
event," within the meaning of Section 4043 of ERISA for which the 30-day

state or locality. Wellesley or Wellesley Bank may amend or terminate any such

consummation of any of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement will
not (i) entitle any Wellesley Employees to severance pay or any increase in
severance pay upon any termination of employment after the date hereof, (ii)
accelerate the time of payment or vesting or trigger any payment or funding
(through a grantor trust or otherwise) of compensation or benefits under,
increase the amount payable or trigger any other material obligation pursuant
to, any of the Wellesley Benefit Plans, (iii) result in any breach or
violation of, or a default under, any of the Wellesley Benefit Plans, (iv)
result in any payment that would be a "parachute payment" to a
"disqualified individual" as those terms are defined in Section 280G of the
Code, without regard to whether such payment is reasonable compensation for
personal services performed or to be performed in the future, or (v) limit or
restrict the right of Wellesley or Wellesley Bank, or after the consummation
of the transactions contemplated hereby, Cambridge, the Surviving Company or
the Surviving Bank, to merge, amend, or terminate any of the Wellesley Benefit
Plans, or (vi) result in payments that would not be deductible under Section

schedule showing the present value of the monetary amounts payable as of the
date specified in such schedule, whether individually or in the aggregate
(including good faith estimates of all amounts not subject to precise

amount and identifying the types and estimated amounts of the in-kind benefits
due under any Wellesley Benefit Plans (other than a plan qualified under
Section 401(a) of the Code) for each such person, specifying the assumptions

Cambridge with any information concerning Wellesley that Cambridge may
reasonably request in connection with the drafting and preparation of the

representatives and the SEC. Cambridge shall provide Wellesley and its counsel
with appropriate opportunity to review and comment on all amendments and
supplements to the Merger Registration Statement and Joint Proxy
Statement/Prospectus and all responses to requests for additional information
and replies to comments prior to their being filed with, or sent to, the SEC.
Each of Cambridge and Wellesley agrees to use all reasonable efforts,

such comments of and requests by the SEC, and to cause the Joint Proxy
Statement/Prospectus and all required amendments and supplements thereto, to

Cambridge Meeting, respectively, at the earliest practicable time.

 

Section 5.07 _Supplements or Amendment_. Wellesley and Cambridge shall
promptly notify the other party if at any time it becomes aware that the
Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus or the Merger Registration Statement contains
any untrue statement of a material fact or omits to state a material fact
required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements
contained therein, in light of the circumstances under which they

 



32

the transactions contemplated hereby and shall not issue any such press
release or make any such public statements without the prior consent of the
other party, which shall not be unreasonably withheld; _provided, however_ ,
that a party may, without the prior consent of the other party (but after such
consultation, to the extent practicable in the circumstances), issue such
press release or make such public statements as may upon the advice of outside
counsel be required by law. Wellesley and Cambridge shall cooperate to develop
all public announcement materials and make appropriate management available
at presentations related to this Agreement as reasonably requested by the
other party.

Section 5.10 _Access; Information_.

(a) Wellesley agrees that upon reasonable notice and subject to applicable
laws relating to the exchange of information, it shall afford Cambridge and
its officers, employees, counsel, accountants and other authorized
representatives such reasonable access during normal business hours throughout
the period prior to the Effective Time to the books, records
(including, without limitation, Tax Returns and work papers of independent
auditors), minute books of directors (other than minutes that discuss any of
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or any confidential
supervisory information), properties and personnel of Wellesley and to such
other information relating to Wellesley as Cambridge may reasonably request
and, during such period, it shall furnish promptly to Cambridge all
information concerning the business, properties and personnel of Wellesley as
Cambridge may reasonably request. Cambridge shall use commercially reasonable
efforts to minimize any interference with Wellesleys regular business
operations during any such access to Wellesleys employees, property, books
and records.

(b) All information furnished to Cambridge by Wellesley pursuant to _Section_
__ _ 5.10(a)_ shall be subject to, and Cambridge shall hold all such
information in confidence in accordance with, the provisions of the Mutual
Agreement of Confidentiality, dated as of July 11, 2019, by and between
Wellesley and Cambridge (the "Confidentiality Agreement").

(c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Section 5.10,
in no event shall Cambridge have access to any information that, based on
advice of Wellesleys counsel, would: (a) reasonably be expected to waive any
material legal privilege; (b) result in the disclosure of any trade secrets of
third parties; or (c) violate any obligation of Wellesley with respect to
confidentiality so long as, with respect to confidentiality, to the extent
specifically requested by Cambridge, Wellesley has made commercially
reasonable efforts to obtain a waiver regarding the possible disclosure from
the third party to whom it owes an obligation of confidentiality. All requests
made pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 5.10_ will be directed to an executive
officer of Wellesley or such Person or Persons as

 



33

    

 may be designated by Wellesley. No investigation by Cambridge of the
business and affairs of Wellesley shall affect or be deemed to modify or waive
any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement in this Agreement, or the
conditions to the obligations of Cambridge to consummate the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement.

 

Section 5.11 _No Solicitation by Wellesley_.

 

(a) Wellesley shall not, and shall cause its officers, directors, employees,
investment bankers, financial advisors, attorneys, accountants, consultants,
affiliates and other agents of Wellesley (collectively, the "Wellesley
Representatives") not to, directly or indirectly, (i) initiate, solicit,
induce or knowingly encourage, or take any action to facilitate the
making of, any inquiry, offer or proposal which constitutes, or could
reasonably be expected to lead to, an Acquisition Proposal; (ii) participate
in any discussions or negotiations regarding any Acquisition Proposal or
furnish, or otherwise afford access, to any Person (other than Cambridge) any
confidential or non-public information or data with respect to Wellesley or
otherwise relating to an Acquisition Proposal; or (iii) without the
prior written consent of Cambridge, release any Person from, waive any
provisions of, or fail to enforce any confidentiality agreement or standstill
agreement to which Wellesley is a party. Wellesley shall, and shall cause each
of the Wellesley Representatives to, (x) immediately cease and cause to be
terminated any and all existing discussions, negotiations, and communications
with any Persons with respect to any existing or potential Acquisition
Proposal, and (y) as soon as practicable after the date hereof, request the
prompt return or destruction of all confidential information made available by
Wellesley or on its behalf during the past twelve months in connection with
any actual or potential Acquisition Proposal. 

(b) Notwithstanding _Section_ __ _ 5.11(a)_, prior to the date of the
Wellesley Meeting, Wellesley may take any of the actions described in clause
(ii) of _Section_ __ _ 5.11(a)_ if, but only if, (i) Wellesley has received a
bona fide unsolicited written Acquisition Proposal that did not result from a
breach of this  _Section_ __ _ 5.11_; (ii) the Wellesley Board determines in
good faith, (A) after consultation with its outside legal counsel and, with
respect to financial matters, its independent financial advisor, that such
Acquisition Proposal constitutes or is reasonably likely to lead to a
Superior Proposal and (B) after consultation with its outside legal counsel,
and with respect to financial matters, it financial advisors, determines in
good faith that it is required to take such actions to comply with its
fiduciary duties under applicable law; (iii) Wellesley has provided Cambridge
with at least twenty-four hours prior notice of such determination; and (iv)
prior to furnishing or affording access to any information or data with
respect to Wellesley or otherwise relating to an Acquisition Proposal,
Wellesley receives from such Person a confidentiality agreement with terms not
materially less favorable to Wellesley than those contained in
the Confidentiality Agreement. In addition, if Wellesley receives an
Acquisition Proposal that constitutes or is reasonably expected to result in a
Superior Proposal and Wellesley has not breached any of the covenants set
forth in this  _Section_ __ _ 5.11_, then Wellesley, or any Wellesley
Representative may, with the prior approval of the Wellesley Board at a duly
called meeting, contact the Person who has submitted (and not withdrawn) such
Acquisition Proposal, or any of such Persons representatives, solely (x) to
clarify the terms and conditions of such Acquisition Proposal and (y) if such
Acquisition Proposal initially is made orally, to direct such Person to submit
the Acquisition Proposal to Wellesley confidentially in writing. Wellesley
shall promptly provide to Cambridge any non-public information regarding
Wellesley provided to any other Person which was not previously provided
to Cambridge, such additional information to be provided no later than the
date of provision of such information to such other party.

(c) Wellesley shall promptly (and in any event orally within 24 hours and in
writing within two days) notify Cambridge if any inquiries, proposals or
offers are received by, any information is requested from, or any negotiations
or discussions are sought to be initiated or continued with, Wellesley or the
Wellesley Representatives, in each case in connection with any Acquisition
Proposal, and such notice shall indicate the name of the Person initiating
such discussions or negotiations or making such inquiry, proposal, offer or
information request and the material terms and conditions of any proposals or
offers (and, in the case of written materials relating to such inquiry,
proposal, offer, information request, negotiations or discussion, providing
copies of such materials (including e-mails or other electronic
communications)). Wellesley agrees that it shall keep Cambridge informed, on a
reasonably current basis (and in any event within 24 hours), of the status
and terms of any material developments with respect to such inquiry, proposal,
offer, information request, negotiations or discussions (including, in each
case, any amendments or modifications thereto). Wellesley shall provide
Cambridge with at least 24 hours prior notice of any meeting of the Wellesley
Board at which the Wellesley Board is reasonably expected to consider any
Acquisition Proposal.

 



34

    

(d) Neither the Wellesley Board nor any committee thereof shall (i) withdraw,
qualify, amend, modify or withhold, or propose to withdraw, qualify, amend,
modify or withhold, in a manner adverse to Cambridge in connection with the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement (including the Merger), the
Wellesley Recommendation, fail to reaffirm the Wellesley Recommendation
within five Business Days following a request by Cambridge, or make any
statement, announcement or release, in connection with the Wellesley Meeting
or otherwise, inconsistent with the Wellesley Recommendation (it being
understood that taking a neutral position or no position with respect to an
Acquisition Proposal shall be considered an adverse modification of the
Wellesley Recommendation); (ii) approve or recommend, or propose to approve or
recommend, any Acquisition Proposal; or (iii) enter into (or cause Wellesley
to enter into) any letter of intent, agreement in principle, acquisition
agreement or other agreement (A) related to any Acquisition Transaction (other
than a confidentiality agreement entered into in accordance with the
provisions of _Section_ __ _ 5.11(b)_) or (B) requiring Wellesley to abandon,
terminate or fail to consummate the Merger or any other transaction
contemplated by this Agreement.

(e) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement,
prior to the date of the Wellesley Meeting, the Wellesley Board may withdraw,
qualify, amend or modify the Wellesley Recommendation in connection therewith
(a "Wellesley Subsequent Determination") and/or terminate this Agreement
pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 7.01(g)(iii)_ after the fourth Business Day
following Cambridges receipt of a written notice (the "Notice of Superior
Proposal") from Wellesley advising Cambridge that the Wellesley Board intends
to determine that a bona fide unsolicited written Acquisition Proposal that
it received (that did not result from a breach of this _Section_ __ _ 5.11_)
constitutes a Superior Proposal if, but only if, (i) the Wellesley Board has
reasonably determined in good faith, after consultation with outside legal
counsel, that it is required to take such actions to comply with its fiduciary
duties under applicable law, (ii) during the three Business Day period after
receipt of the Notice of Superior Proposal by Cambridge (the "Notice
Period"), Wellesley and the Wellesley Board shall have cooperated and
negotiated in good faith with Cambridge to make such adjustments,
modifications or amendments to the terms and conditions of this Agreement as
would enable Wellesley to proceed with the Wellesley Recommendation without a
Wellesley Subsequent Determination; _provided, however_ , that Cambridge shall
not have any obligation to propose any adjustments, modifications or
amendments to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, and (iii) at the
end of the Notice Period, after taking into account any such adjusted,
modified or amended terms as may have been proposed by Cambridge since its
receipt of such Notice of Superior Proposal, the Wellesley Board in good
faith makes the determination (A) in clause (i) of this _Section_ __ _
5.11(e)_ and (B) that such Acquisition Proposal constitutes a Superior
Proposal. In the event of any material revisions to the Superior Proposal,
Wellesley shall be required to deliver a new Notice of Superior Proposal to
Cambridge and again comply with the requirements of this _Section_ __ _
5.11(e)_, except that the Notice Period shall be reduced to two Business
Days. In addition to the foregoing, the Wellesley Board shall not submit to
the vote of its stockholders any Acquisition Proposal other than the Merger at
the Wellesley Meeting.

 

(f) Nothing contained in this _Section_ __ _ 5.11_ shall prohibit Wellesley
or the Wellesley Board from complying with Wellesleys obligations required
under Rules 14d-9 (as if such rule were applicable to Wellesley) and 14e-2(a)
(as if such rule were applicable to Wellesley) promulgated under the Exchange
Act; _provided, however_ , that any such disclosure relating to an Acquisition
Proposal shall be deemed a change in the Wellesley Recommendation unless it is
limited to a stop, look and listen communication or the Wellesley Board
reaffirms the Wellesley Recommendation in such disclosure.

Section 5.12 _Certain Policies_. Prior to the Effective Date, Wellesley
shall, consistent with GAAP and applicable banking laws and regulations,
modify or change its loan, OREO, accrual, reserve, tax, litigation and real
estate valuation policies and practices (including loan classifications and
levels of reserves) so as to be applied on a basis that is consistent with
that of Cambridge; _provided, however_ , that Wellesley shall not be obligated
to take any action pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 5.12_ unless and until
Cambridge acknowledges, and Wellesley is satisfied, that all conditions to
Wellesleys obligation to consummate the Merger have been satisfied and that
Cambridge shall consummate the Merger in accordance with the terms of this
Agreement, and further provided that in any event, no accrual or reserve made
by Wellesley pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 5.12_ or the consequences
resulting therefrom shall constitute or be deemed to be a breach, violation of
or failure to satisfy any representation, warranty, covenant, agreement,
condition or other provision of this Agreement or otherwise be considered in
determining whether any such breach, violation or failure to satisfy shall
have occurred. The recording of any such adjustments shall

 



35

    

 not be deemed to imply any misstatement of previously furnished financial
statements or information and shall not be construed as concurrence of
Wellesley or its management with any such adjustments, nor any admission that
the previously furnished financial statements or information did not fully
comply in all respects with GAAP or regulatory requirements.

 

Section 5.13 _Indemnification_.

 

(a) From and after the Effective Time, Cambridge (the "Indemnifying Party")
shall indemnify and hold harmless each present and former director and
officer of Wellesley or Wellesley Bank, as applicable, determined as of the
Effective Time (the "Indemnified Parties") against any costs or expenses
(including reasonable attorneys fees), judgments, amounts paid
in settlement, fines, penalties, losses, claims, damages or liabilities
incurred in connection with any claim, action, suit, proceeding or
investigation, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative, and
whether formal or informal (each, a "Proceeding") arising out of matters
existing or occurring at or prior to the Effective Time, whether asserted or
claimed prior to, at or after the Effective Time, arising in whole or in part
out of or pertaining to the fact that he or she was a director or officer of
Wellesley or Wellesley Bank or is or was serving at the request of Wellesley
or Wellesley Bank as a director, officer, employee or other agent of any other
organization or in any capacity with respect to any employee benefit plan of
Wellesley or Wellesley Bank, including without limitation matters related to
the negotiation, execution and performance of this Agreement or any of the
transactions contemplated hereby, to the fullest extent which such
Indemnified Parties would be entitled under the charter or bylaws of
Wellesley or Wellesley Bank as in effect on the date hereof (subject to change
as required by law). Cambridges obligations under this _Section_ __ _
5.13(a)_ shall continue in full force and effect for a period of six years
from the Effective Time; _provided, however,_ that all rights to
indemnification and advancement in respect of any Proceeding asserted or made
within such period shall continue until the final disposition of such
Proceeding. Notwithstanding any other provision of this _Section_ __ _ 5.13_,
the Indemnifying Party shall advance all reasonable costs, expenses and fees
(including reasonable attorneys fees) incurred by or on behalf of an
Indemnified Party in connection with any Proceeding within thirty (30) days
after the receipt by the Indemnifying Party of a statement or statements from
the Indemnified Party requesting such advance or advances from time to time,
whether prior to or after final disposition of such Proceeding. Such statement
or statements shall be made in good faith and shall reasonably evidence the
costs, expenses and fees incurred by the Indemnified Party (which
shall include invoices in connection with such costs, fees and expenses but,
in the case of invoices in connection with legal services, any references to
legal work performed or to expenditure made that would cause the Indemnified
Party to waive any privilege or protection accorded by applicable law shall
not be included with the invoice), and shall include or be preceded or
accompanied by a written undertaking by or on behalf of the Indemnified Party
to repay any costs, expenses or fees advanced if it shall ultimately be
determined that the Indemnified Party is not entitled to be indemnified
against such costs, expenses or fees. Any advances and undertakings to repay
pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 5.13_ shall be unsecured and interest free
and made without regard to the Indemnified Partys ability to repay such
advances or ultimate entitlement to indemnification.

 

(b) Any Indemnified Party wishing to claim indemnification under this
_Section_ __ _ 5.13_, upon learning of any such Proceeding, shall promptly
notify the Indemnifying Party, but the failure to so notify shall not relieve
the Indemnifying Party of any liability it may have to such Indemnified Party
except to the extent that such failure does actually prejudice
the Indemnifying Party. In the event of any such Proceeding (whether arising
before or after the Effective Time), (i) the Indemnifying Party shall have the
right to assume the defense thereof with counsel which is reasonably
satisfactory to the Indemnified Party and the Indemnifying Party shall not be
liable to such Indemnified Parties for any legal expenses of other counsel or
any other expenses subsequently incurred by such Indemnified Parties in
connection with the defense thereof, except that if the Indemnifying Party
elects not to assume such defense or counsel for the Indemnified Parties
advises that there are issues which raise actual or potential conflicts of
interest between the Indemnifying Party and the Indemnified Parties, the
Indemnified Parties may retain counsel which is reasonably satisfactory to the
Indemnifying Party, and the Indemnifying Party shall pay, promptly as
statements therefor are received, the reasonable fees and expenses of such
counsel for the Indemnified Parties (which may not exceed one firm in any
jurisdiction unless counsel for the Indemnified Parties advises that there are
issues that raise conflicts of interest between the Indemnified Parties), (ii)
the Indemnified Parties will reasonably cooperate in the defense of any such
matter, (iii) the Indemnifying Party shall not be liable for any settlement
effected without its prior written consent and (iv) the Indemnifying Party
shall have no obligation hereunder in the event that indemnification of an
Indemnified Party in the manner contemplated hereby is prohibited by
applicable

 



36

    

 laws and regulations or by a final non-appealable adjudication of an
applicable federal or state banking agency or a court of competent
jurisdiction.

 

(c) Prior to the Effective Time, Cambridge shall purchase an extended
reporting period endorsement under Wellesleys existing directors and
officers liability insurance coverage for Wellesleys directors and officers
in a form acceptable to Wellesley which shall provide such directors and
officers with coverage for six years following the Effective Time for claims
made against such directors and officers arising from any act, error or
omission by such directors and officers existing or occurring at or prior to
the Effective Time of not less than the existing coverage under, and have
other terms at least as favorable to, the directors and officers than the
directors and officers liability insurance coverage presently maintained by
Wellesley (provided that Cambridge may substitute therefor policies which are
not materially less advantageous than such policy or single premium tail
coverage with policy limits equal to Wellesleys existing coverage limits), so
long as the aggregate cost is not more than 250% of the annual premium
currently paid by Wellesley for such insurance (the "Premium Limit"). In the
event that the Premium Limit is insufficient for such coverage, Cambridge
shall use its reasonable best efforts to purchase such lesser coverage as may
be obtained with such amount.

 

(d) The rights of indemnification and advancement as provided by this
_Section_ __ _ 5.13_ shall not be deemed exclusive of any other rights to
which the Indemnified Party may at any time be entitled under the charter or
bylaws of Wellesley or as provided in applicable law as in effect on the date
hereof (subject to change as required by law), any agreement, a vote
of stockholders, a resolution of directors of Wellesley, or otherwise. In the
event that an Indemnified Party, pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 5.13_, seeks
an adjudication of such persons rights under, or to recover damages
for breach of, this _Section_ __ _ 5.13_, or to recover under any directors
and officers liability insurance coverage maintained by Wellesley or
Cambridge, the Indemnifying Party shall pay on such Indemnified
Partys behalf, any and all reasonable costs, expenses and fees (including
reasonable attorneys fees ) incurred by such Indemnified Party in such
judicial adjudication, to the fullest extent permitted by law, only to the
extent that the Indemnified Party prevails in such judicial adjudication.

(e) If Cambridge or any of its successors or assigns shall consolidate with or
merge into any other entity and shall not be the continuing or surviving
entity of such consolidation or merger or shall transfer all or substantially
all of its assets to any other entity, then and in each case, proper provision
shall be made so that the successors and assigns of Cambridge shall assume
the obligations set forth in this _Section_ __ _ 5.13_.

 

Section 5.14 _Employees; Benefit Plans_.

 

(a) Following the Closing Date and except to the extent an alternative
treatment is set forth in this _Section_ __ _ 5.14_, Cambridge may choose to
maintain any or all of the Wellesley Benefit Plans in its sole discretion and
Wellesley and Wellesley Bank shall cooperate with Cambridge in order to effect
any plan terminations to be made as of the Effective Time. For the period
commencing at the Effective Time and ending on December 31, 2020 (or until the
applicable Continuing Employees earlier termination of employment), Cambridge
shall provide, or cause to be provided, to each employee of Wellesley
Bank and Wellesley who continues in employment with the Surviving Bank as of
the Closing Date ("Continuing Employees") (i) base salary or a base rate of
pay at least equal to the base pay or base rate of salary provided to such
Continuing Employee immediately prior to the Effective Time and (ii) other
benefits (other than severance, termination pay or equity compensation) at
least substantially comparable in the aggregate to the benefits provided to
such Continuing Employee immediately prior to the Effective Time. For any
Wellesley Benefit Plan terminated for which there is a comparable employee
benefit or compensation plan, program, policy, agreement or arrangement of
Cambridge or any of its Subsidiaries (a "Cambridge Benefit Plan") of general
applicability, Cambridge shall take all commercially reasonable action so that
employees of Wellesley or Wellesley Bank shall be entitled to participate in
such Cambridge Benefit Plan to the same extent as similarly-situated
employees of Cambridge (it being understood that inclusion of the employees of
Wellesley and Wellesley Bank in the Cambridge Benefit Plans may occur at
different times with respect to different plans). Cambridge shall cause each
Cambridge Benefit Plan in which employees of Wellesley or Wellesley Bank are
eligible to participate to take into account for purposes of eligibility and
vesting under the Cambridge Benefit Plans (but not for purposes of benefit
accrual) the service of such employees with Wellesley or Wellesley Bank to
the same extent as such service was credited for such purpose by Wellesley or
Wellesley Bank; _provided, however,_ that such service shall not be recognized
to the extent that such recognition would result in a duplication of
benefits.

 



37

    

 Nothing herein shall limit the ability of Cambridge to amend or terminate
any of the Wellesley Benefit Plans or Cambridge Benefit Plans in accordance
with their terms at any time; _provided, however,_ that Cambridge shall
continue to maintain the Wellesley Benefit Plans (other than stock-based or
incentive plans) for which there is a comparable Cambridge Benefit Plan until
the Wellesley Employees are permitted to participate in the Cambridge Benefit
Plans, unless such Cambridge Benefit Plan has been frozen or terminated with
respect to similarly situated employees of Cambridge or any Subsidiary of
Cambridge. Following the Closing Date, Cambridge shall honor, in accordance
with Wellesleys policies and procedures in effect as of the date hereof, any
employee expense reimbursement obligations of Wellesley for out-of-pocket
expenses incurred during the calendar year in which the Closing occurs by any
Wellesley Employee whose employment continues after the Effective Time. In the
event Cambridge elects to terminate the Wellesley Bank 401(k) Plan prior to
the Closing Date, Cambridge shall take any and all actions as may be required
to permit Continuing Employees to roll over their account balances in the
Wellesley Bank 401(k) Plan into Cambridge Bank 401(k) Plan.

 

(b) Cambridge shall honor, under the vacation policies of Wellesley and
Wellesley Bank, as disclosed on _Wellesley Disclosure_ _Schedule _ _5.14(b)_

reasonable efforts to cause each such plan to (i) waive any preexisting
condition limitations to the extent such conditions are covered under the
applicable Cambridge plan, (ii) provide credit under such plans for any
deductible, co-payment and out-of-pocket expenses incurred by the employees
and their beneficiaries during the portion of the calendar year prior to such
participation and (iii) waive any waiting period limitation, actively-at-work
requirement or evidence of insurability requirement which would otherwise be
applicable to such employee on or after the Effective Time, in each case to
the extent such employee had satisfied any similar limitation or requirement
under an analogous Wellesley Benefit Plan prior to the Effective Time.

 

(d) Concurrently with the execution of this Agreement, the CIC Agreement shall
have been executed and be in full force and effect.

 

(e) Cambridge shall honor and perform under each agreement or contract set
forth in _Wellesley Disclosure Schedule 5.14(e)_.

Bank ESOP based on their account balances under the Wellesley Bank ESOP as of
the date of termination of the Wellesley Bank ESOP and distributed to

advance of the Effective Time. Wellesley Bank will adopt such amendments to
the Wellesley Bank ESOP to effect the provisions of this Section 5.14(f).
Promptly following the receipt of a favorable determination letter from the
IRS regarding the qualified status of the Wellesley Bank ESOP upon its
termination, the account balances in the Wellesley Bank ESOP shall either be
distributed to participants and beneficiaries or transferred to an
eligible tax-qualified retirement plan or individual retirement account as a
participant or beneficiary may direct; provided however, that nothing
contained herein shall delay the distribution or transfer of account balances
in the Wellesley Bank ESOP in the ordinary course for reasons other than the
termination of such plan. Prior to the Closing Date, Wellesley Bank shall
provide Cambridge with the final documentation evidencing that the actions
contemplated herein have been effectuated. Notwithstanding anything herein to
the contrary, Wellesley Bank

ARTICLE VII

 

TERMINATION

 

Section 7.01 _Termination_. This Agreement may be terminated, and the

to the Closing; _provided, however,_ that neither party shall have the right
to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 7.01(d)_ unless

so determines by a vote of the majority of the members of the entire
Wellesley Board, at any time during the five-day period commencing with the
Determination Date (as defined below), if both of the following conditions are
satisfied:

 

(A) The quotient obtained by dividing the Average Closing Price by the
Starting Price (as defined below) (the "Cambridge Ratio") shall be less than
0.80; and

(B) (x) the Cambridge Ratio shall be less than (y) the quotient obtained by
dividing the Final Index Price by the Index Price on the Starting Date (each

as the "Index Ratio");

subject, however, to the following three sentences. If Wellesley elects to
exercise its termination right pursuant to this Section 7.01(h), it shall give
written notice to Cambridge promptly, and in any event within the five-day
period commencing with the Determination Date. During the five-day period
commencing with its receipt of such notice, Cambridge shall have the option to
increase the consideration to be received by the holders of Wellesley Stock
hereunder, by adjusting the Exchange Ratio (calculated to the nearest one one-
thousandth) to equal the lesser of (x) a number (rounded to the nearest
one one-thousandth) obtained by dividing (A) the product of the Starting
Price, 0.80 and the Exchange Ratio (as then in effect) by (B) the Average
Closing Price and (y) a number (rounded to the nearest one one-thousandth)
obtained by dividing (A) the product of the Index Ratio, 0.80 and the Exchange
Ratio (as then in effect) by (B) the Cambridge Ratio. If Cambridge so elects
within such five-day period, it shall give prompt written notice to Wellesley
of such election and the revised Exchange Ratio, whereupon no termination
shall have occurred pursuant to this Section 7.01(h) and this Agreement shall
remain in effect in accordance with its terms (except as the Exchange Ratio
shall have been so modified.)

For purposes of this Section 7.01(h) the following terms shall have the
meanings indicated:

"Determination Date" shall mean the 10th day prior to the Closing
Date, provided that if shares of the Cambridge Stock are not actually traded
on NASDAQ on such day, the Determination Date shall be the immediately
preceding day to the 10th day prior to the Closing Date on which shares of

or Wellesley Bank after an Acquisition Proposal has been publicly announced or
otherwise made known Wellesley.

further obligation to any other party hereunder except (i) as set forth in
_Section_ __ _ 7.01_ and  _Section_ __ _ 8.01_ and (ii) that termination

seeking specific performance in equity to enforce the terms of this Agreement.

Shareholder with respect to the Shares. Notwithstanding anything contained
herein to the contrary, this irrevocable proxy shall automatically terminate
upon the termination of this Agreement.

reasonable best efforts to prohibit any of his, her or its representatives or

that it will be impossible to measure in money the damage to Cambridge if

that, in the event of any such failure, Cambridge will not have an adequate
remedy at law or in equity. Accordingly, Shareholder agrees that injunctive
relief or other equitable remedy, in addition to remedies at law or in
damages, is the appropriate remedy for any such failure and will not oppose
the granting of such relief on the basis that Cambridge has an adequate remedy
at law. Shareholder agrees that Shareholder will not seek, and agrees to waive
any requirement for, the securing or posting of a bond in connection
with Cambridges seeking or obtaining such equitable relief.

Section 7\. _Term of Agreement; Termination_. The term of this Agreement
shall commence on the date hereof. This Agreement may be terminated at any
time prior to consummation of the transactions contemplated by the Merger
Agreement by the written consent of the parties hereto, and shall be
automatically terminated upon the earlier to occur of: (a) the Effective Time
or (b) in the event that the Merger Agreement is terminated in accordance with
its terms. Upon any such termination, no party shall have any further
obligations or 

   

 liabilities hereunder; provided, however, such termination shall not relieve
any party from liability for any willful breach of this Agreement prior to
such termination.

 

Section 8\. _Entire Agreement; Amendments_. This Agreement supersedes all
prior agreements, written or oral, among the parties hereto with respect to
the subject matter hereof and contains the entire agreement among the parties
with respect to the subject matter hereof. This Agreement may not be amended,
supplemented or modified, and no provisions hereof may be modified or
waived, except by an instrument in writing signed by each party hereto. No
waiver of any provisions hereof by either party shall be deemed a waiver of
any other provisions hereof by any such party, nor shall any such waiver be
deemed a continuing waiver of any provision hereof by such party.

Section 9\. _Severability_. In the event that any one or more provisions of
this Agreement shall for any reason be held invalid, illegal or unenforceable
in any respect, by any court of competent jurisdiction, such invalidity,
illegality or unenforceability shall not affect any other provisions of this
Agreement and the parties shall use their reasonable efforts to substitute a
valid, legal and enforceable provision which, insofar as practical, implements
the purposes and intents of this Agreement.

 

Section 10\. _Capacity as Shareholder_. The covenants contained herein shall
apply to Shareholder solely in his or her capacity as a shareholder of
Wellesley, and no covenant contained herein shall apply to Shareholder in his
or her capacity as a director, officer or employee of Wellesley or in any
other capacity. Nothing contained in this Agreement shall be deemed to apply
to, or limit in any manner, the obligations of Shareholder to comply with his
or her fiduciary duties as a director of Wellesley.

 

Section 11\. _Governing Law_. This Agreement shall be governed by, and
interpreted in accordance with, the laws of the Commonwealth of
Massachusetts, without regard for conflict of law provisions.

Section 12\. _Notice_. All notices and other communications hereunder shall
be in writing and shall be deemed given if delivered personally or sent by
overnight courier (providing proof of delivery) to Cambridge in accordance
with Section 8.06 of the Merger Agreement and to each Shareholder at

VOTING AGREEMENT

This VOTING AGREEMENT (this " _Agreement_ ") is dated as of December ___,
2019, by and between the undersigned holders (" _Shareholders_ ") of common

the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956, as amended (" _Cambridge_ "), and
Wellesley Bancorp, Inc., a Maryland corporation (" _Wellesley_ "). All terms
used herein and not defined herein shall have the meanings assigned thereto in
the Merger Agreement (as defined below).

 

WHEREAS, concurrently with the execution of this Agreement, Cambridge,
Cambridge Trust, a Massachusetts-chartered trust company and wholly owned
subsidiary of Cambridge (" _Cambridge Trust_ "), Wellesley and Wellesley Bank,
a Massachusetts-chartered bank and wholly owned subsidiary of Wellesley ("
_Wellesley Bank_ "), are entering into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (as
such agreement may be subsequently amended or modified, the " _Merger
Agreement_ "), pursuant to which Wellesley shall merge with and into
Cambridge, and Wellesley Bank shall merge with and into Cambridge Trust,
and in connection therewith, each outstanding share of Wellesley Common Stock
will be converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration;

 

WHEREAS, each Shareholder beneficially owns and has sole or shared voting
power with respect to the number of shares of Cambridge Stock identified
opposite such Shareholders name on _Exhibit A_ hereto (such shares, together
with all shares of Cambridge Stock with respect to which such Shareholder
subsequently acquires beneficial ownership during the term of this Agreement,
including the right to acquire beneficial ownership (as defined in Rule 13d-3
under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended) through the exercise of
any stock options, warrants or similar instruments, being referred to as the
" _Shares_ "); and

WHEREAS, it is a condition to the willingness of Wellesley to enter into the
Merger Agreement that the Shareholders execute and deliver this Agreement.

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the promises, representations, warranties
and agreements contained herein, and for other good and valuable
consideration, the receipt and adequacy of which are hereby acknowledged, the
parties hereto agree as follows:

 

Section 1\. _Agreement to Vote Shares_. Each Shareholder agrees that, while
this Agreement is in effect, at any meeting of shareholders of Cambridge,
however called, or at any adjournment thereof, or in any other circumstances
in which such Shareholder is entitled to vote, consent or give any other
approval, except as otherwise agreed to in writing in advance by Wellesley,
such Shareholder shall:



     | (c) |

appear at each such meeting or otherwise cause such Shareholders Shares to be
counted as present thereat for purposes of calculating a quorum; and 

---|---|--- 



     | (d) |

vote (or cause to be voted), in person or by proxy, all the Shares (whether
acquired heretofore or hereafter) that are beneficially owned by such
Shareholder or as to which such Shareholder has, directly or indirectly, the
right to vote or direct the voting, (i) in favor of adoption and approval of
the Merger Agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby; (ii) in favor
of the issuance of shares of Cambridge Common Stock in connection with the
Merger; and (iii) against any action or 

---|---|--- 
        |  agreement that would result in a breach of any covenant,
representation or warranty or any other obligation or agreement of Cambridge
contained in the Merger Agreement or of such Shareholder contained in this
Agreement; _provided_ , _however_ , that, if the manner in which such
Shareholders Shares (or any portion thereof) are owned is such that such
Shareholder does not have the right to cause such Shares to be so voted, such
Shareholder shall use such Shareholders reasonable best efforts to cause such
Shares to be so voted. 
---|--- 
 

Section 2\. _No Transfers_. While this Agreement is in effect, each
Shareholder agrees not to, directly or indirectly, sell, transfer, pledge,
assign or otherwise dispose of, or enter into any contract, option, commitment
or other arrangement or understanding with respect to the sale, transfer,
pledge, assignment or other disposition of, any of such Shareholders Shares,
except the following transfers shall be permitted: (a) transfers by will or
operation of law, in which case this Agreement shall bind the transferee, (b)
transfers pursuant to any pledge agreement, subject to the pledgee
agreeing in writing to be bound by the terms of this Agreement, (c) transfers
in connection with estate and tax planning purposes, including transfers to
relatives, trusts and charitable organizations, subject to the transferee
agreeing in writing to be bound by the terms of this Agreement, (d) a
transfer of such Shares by such Shareholder to Cambridge in connection with
the vesting, settlement, or exercise of Cambridge equity awards granted
pursuant to a Cambridge employee benefits plan outstanding as of the date
hereof, and (e) such transfers as Wellesley may otherwise permit in its sole
discretion. Any transfer or other disposition in violation of the terms of
this Section 2 shall be null and void.

 

Section 3\. _Representations and Warranties of Shareholder_. Each Shareholder
severally represents and warrants to and agrees with Wellesley as follows:



     | (e) |

Such Shareholder has all requisite capacity and authority to enter into and
perform his, her or its obligations under this Agreement. 

---|---|--- 



     | (f) |

This Agreement has been duly executed and delivered by such Shareholder, and
assuming the due authorization, execution and delivery by Wellesley,
constitutes the valid and legally binding obligation of such Shareholder
enforceable against such Shareholder in accordance with its terms, subject to
bankruptcy, insolvency, fraudulent transfer, reorganization, moratorium and
similar laws of general applicability relating to or affecting creditors
rights and to general equity principles. 

---|---|--- 



     | (g) |

The execution and delivery of this Agreement by such Shareholder does not, and
the performance by such Shareholder of his, her or its obligations hereunder
and the consummation by such Shareholder of the transactions contemplated
hereby will not, violate or conflict with, or constitute a default under, any
agreement, instrument, contract or other obligation or any order, arbitration
award, judgment or decree to which such Shareholder is a party or by which
such Shareholder is bound, or any statute, rule or regulation to which such
Shareholder is subject or, in the event that such Shareholder is a
corporation, partnership, trust or other entity, any charter, bylaw or other
organizational document of such Shareholder. 

---|---|--- 



     | (h) |

Except as set forth on Schedule 1, such Shareholder is the record and
beneficial owner of, or is the trustee that is the record holder of, and
whose beneficiaries are the beneficial owners of, and has good title to all of
the Shares set forth opposite such Shareholders name on _Exhibit A_ hereto,
and such Shares are so owned free and clear of any liens, security interests,
charges or other encumbrances. Such Shareholder does not own, of record or
beneficially, any shares of capital stock of Cambridge other than such Shares
(other than shares of capital stock subject to stock options or warrants over
which such Shareholder will have no voting rights until the exercise of such
stock options or warrants). Such Shareholder has the right to vote such Shares
and none of  

---|---|--- 
        |  such Shares are subject to any voting trust or other agreement,
arrangement or restriction with respect to the voting of such Shares, except
as contemplated by this Agreement. 
---|--- 
 

Section 4\. _Irrevocable Proxy_. Subject to the last sentence of this Section
4, by execution of this Agreement, each Shareholder does hereby appoint
Wellesley with full power of substitution and resubstitution, as such
Shareholders true and lawful attorney and irrevocable proxy, to the full
extent of such Shareholders rights with respect to such Shareholders
Shares, to vote, if such Shareholder is unable to perform his, her or its
obligations under this Agreement, each of such Shares that such Shareholder
shall be entitled to so vote with respect to the matters set forth in Section
1 hereof at any meeting of the shareholders of Cambridge, and at any
adjournment or postponement thereof, and in connection with any action of the
shareholders of Cambridge taken by written consent. Such Shareholder intends
this proxy to be irrevocable and coupled with an interest hereafter until the
termination of this Agreement pursuant to the terms of Section 6 hereof and
hereby revokes any proxy previously granted by such Shareholder with respect
to such Shares. Notwithstanding anything contained herein to the contrary,
this irrevocable proxy shall automatically terminate upon the termination of
this Agreement.

 

Section 5\. _Specific Performance and Remedies_. Each Shareholder acknowledges
that it will be impossible to measure in money the damage to Wellesley if
such Shareholder fails to comply with the obligations imposed by this
Agreement and that, in the event of any such failure, Wellesley will not have
an adequate remedy at law or in equity. Accordingly, such Shareholder
agrees that injunctive relief or other equitable remedy, in addition to
remedies at law or in damages, is the appropriate remedy for any such failure
and will not oppose the granting of such relief on the basis that Wellesley
has an adequate remedy at law. Each Shareholder agrees that such Shareholder
will not seek, and agrees to waive any requirement for, the securing or
posting of a bond in connection with Wellesleys seeking or obtaining such
equitable relief.

 

Section 6\. _Term of Agreement; Termination_. The term of this Agreement shall
commence on the date hereof. This Agreement may be terminated at any time
prior to consummation of the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement
by the written consent of the parties hereto, and shall be automatically
terminated upon the earlier to occur of: (a) the Effective Time or (b) in the
event that the Merger Agreement is terminated in accordance with its terms.
Upon any such termination, no party shall have any further obligations or
liabilities hereunder; provided, however, such termination shall not relieve
any party from liability for any willful breach of this Agreement prior to
such termination.

Section 7\. _Entire Agreement; Amendments_. This Agreement supersedes all
prior agreements, written or oral, among the parties hereto with respect to
the subject matter hereof and contains the entire agreement among the parties
with respect to the subject matter hereof. This Agreement may not be amended,
supplemented or modified, and no provisions hereof may be modified or waived,
except by an instrument in writing signed by each party hereto. No waiver of
any provisions hereof by either party shall be deemed a waiver of any other
provisions hereof by any such party, nor shall any such waiver be deemed a
continuing waiver of any provision hereof by such party.

 

Section 8\. _Severability_. In the event that any one or more provisions of
this Agreement shall for any reason be held invalid, illegal or unenforceable
in any respect, by any court of competent jurisdiction, such invalidity,
illegality or unenforceability shall not affect any other provisions of this
Agreement and the parties shall use their reasonable efforts to substitute a
valid, legal and enforceable provision which, insofar as practical, implements
the purposes and intents of this Agreement.

 

Section 9\. _Capacity as Shareholder_. The covenants contained herein shall
apply to each Shareholder solely in his or her capacity as a shareholder of
Cambridge, and no covenant contained herein shall apply to such Shareholder in
his or her capacity as a director, officer or employee of Cambridge or in any
other

   

 capacity. Nothing contained in this Agreement shall be deemed to apply to,
or limit in any manner, the obligations of such Shareholder to comply with his
or her fiduciary duties as a director of Cambridge.

Section 10\. _Governing Law_. This Agreement shall be governed by, and
interpreted in accordance with, the laws of the Commonwealth of
Massachusetts, without regard for conflict of law provisions.

Section 11\. _Notice_. All notices and other communications hereunder shall
be in writing and shall be deemed given if delivered personally or sent by
overnight courier (providing proof of delivery) to Cambridge in accordance
with Section 8.06 of the Merger Agreement and to each Shareholder at its

a party as shall be specified by like notice).
