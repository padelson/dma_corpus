ARTICLE II 

   

CONVERSION OF SHARES; EXCHANGE OF CERTIFICATES  

  

 Section 2.01 _Effect on Capital Stock_. At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of the Company, Parent, Merger Sub or the holders of any securities of the Company, Parent or Merger Sub: 

  

 (a) _Conversion of Company Common Stock_. Subject to Section 2.03, each issued and outstanding share of Company Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (each, a " _Share_ "), other than (i) any Shares held by any direct or indirect wholly owned Subsidiary of the Company (the " _Remaining Shares_ "), (ii) any Cancelled Shares (as defined herein) and (iii) any Dissenting Shares (as defined herein), shall be converted automatically into and shall thereafter represent the right to receive the following (together with any consideration provided for in Section 2.01(e), the " _Merger Consideration_ "): 

    

 (i) for each such Share with respect to which an election to receive Parent Common Stock (as defined herein) has been effectively made and not revoked 

   ##### 

  

    

pursuant to Section 2.02 (each, an " _Electing Share_ "), the right to
receive one fully paid and non-assessable share of Parent Common Stock; and 

   

 (ii) for each such Share other than Electing Shares, the right to receive in cash, without interest, $120.00 per Share (the " _Cash Election Price_ "). 

 

As of the Effective Time, all Shares that have been converted into the right
to receive the Merger Consideration shall be automatically cancelled and
shall cease to exist, and each holder of any such Shares shall cease to have
any rights with respect to such Shares other than the right to receive the
Merger Consideration for each such Share. 

   

 (b) _Parent, Merger Sub and Company-Owned Shares_. Each Share that is owned, directly or indirectly, by Parent or Merger Sub immediately prior to the Effective Time, if any, or that is held in treasury by the Company immediately prior to the Effective Time (the " _Cancelled Shares_ ") shall, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of the holder thereof, be cancelled and shall cease to exist, and no consideration shall be delivered in exchange for such cancellation. 

   

 (c) _Conversion of Merger Sub Common Stock; Remaining Shares_. At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of the holder thereof, each share of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of Merger Sub issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be converted into and become one validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable share of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of the Surviving Corporation and shall with the Remaining Shares (each of which shall be converted into and become such number of validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable shares of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of the Surviving Corporation as shall be necessary to maintain relative ownership percentages) constitute the only outstanding shares of capital stock of the Surviving Corporation. From and after the Effective Time, all certificates representing the common stock of Merger Sub, if any, shall be deemed for all purposes to represent the number of shares of common stock of the Surviving Corporation into which they were converted in accordance with the immediately preceding sentence. 

   

 (d) _Shares of Dissenting Stockholders_. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, any issued and outstanding Shares held by a Person (a " _Dissenting Stockholder_ ") who has not voted in favor of or consented to the adoption of this Agreement and has complied with all the provisions of the DGCL concerning the right of holders of Shares to require appraisal of their Shares (" _Dissenting Shares_ ") shall not be converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration as described in Section 2.01(a), but shall become the right to receive such consideration as may be determined to be due to such Dissenting Stockholder pursuant to the procedures set forth in Section 262 of the DGCL. If such Dissenting Stockholder withdraws its demand for appraisal or fails to perfect or otherwise loses its right of appraisal, in any case pursuant to the DGCL, its Shares shall be deemed to be converted as of the Effective Time into the right to receive the Merger Consideration for each such Share in accordance with the provisions of this Agreement (it being understood that if such Dissenting Stockholder withdraws its demand for appraisal or fails to perfect or otherwise loses its right of appraisal, in any case pursuant to the DGCL, following the Election Deadline (as defined herein) its Shares shall be deemed to be converted as of the Effective Time into the right to receive the Cash   ##### 

  

  

  

Election Price for each such Share, without interest). At the Effective Time,
any holder of Dissenting Shares shall cease to have any rights with respect
thereto, except the rights set forth in Section 262 of the DGCL and as
provided in the previous sentence. The Company shall give Parent prompt notice
of any demands for appraisal of Shares received by the Company, withdrawals
of such demands and any other instruments served pursuant to Section 262 of
the DGCL and shall give Parent the opportunity to participate in all
negotiations and proceedings with respect thereto. The Company shall
not, without the prior written consent of Parent (not to be unreasonably
withheld), make any payment with respect to, or settle or offer to settle,
any such demands. 

   

 (e) _No Fractional Shares_. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, neither certificates nor scrip for fractional shares of Parent Common Stock shall be issued in the Merger. Each holder of Shares who otherwise would have been entitled to a fraction of a share of Parent Common Stock shall receive in lieu thereof cash (without interest) in an amount determined by multiplying the fractional share interest to which such holder would otherwise be entitled by the Cash Election Price. No such holder shall be entitled to dividends, voting rights or any other rights in respect of any fractional share of Parent Common Stock. 

   

 (f) _Adjustments_. If at any time during the period between the date of this Agreement and the Effective Time, any change in the outstanding shares of capital stock of the Company, or securities convertible or exchangeable into or exercisable for shares of capital stock, shall occur as a result of any reclassification, recapitalization, stock split (including a reverse stock split) or subdivision or combination, exchange or readjustment of shares, or any stock dividend or stock distribution with a record date during such period (excluding, in each case, normal quarterly cash dividends), merger or other similar transaction, the Merger Consideration shall be equitably adjusted, without duplication, to reflect such change; _provided_ that nothing in this Section 2.01(f) shall be construed to permit the Company to take any action with respect to its securities that is prohibited by the terms of this Agreement. 

   

 Section 2.02 _Election Procedures_. 

  

 (a) _Parent Stock Elections; Option Elections_. 

    

 (i) Each Person who is a record holder of Shares on the Election Form Record Date (as defined herein), or who becomes a record holder of Shares during the period between the Election Form Record Date and the Election Deadline and has received the Election Form and related materials pursuant to Section 2.02(c), shall have the right to submit an Election Form specifying the number of Shares, if any, held by such Person that such Person desires to have converted into the right to receive Parent Common Stock (a " _Parent Stock Election_ "). Any such record holder who fails properly to submit an Election Form on or before the Election Deadline (as defined herein) in accordance with the procedures set forth in this Section 2.02 shall be deemed to have not made a Parent Stock Election and thereby be entitled to the Cash Election Price for each such Share. Holders of record of Company Common Stock who hold such Company Common Stock as nominees, trustees or in other representative capacities may submit a separate Election Form on or before the Election Deadline with respect to each beneficial owner for whom such nominee, trustee or representative holds Company Common Stock. 

   ##### 

  

   

 (ii) Each Person who is a holder of a Company Stock Option on the Election Form Record Date, or who becomes a holder of a Company Stock Option during the period between the Election Form Record Date and the Election Deadline and has received the Election Form and related materials pursuant to Section 2.02(c), shall have the right to submit an Election Form specifying the number of Company Stock Options held by such holder, if any, that such Person irrevocably commits to exercise (subject to any requirements with respect to method of exercise imposed by the Company in order to facilitate the implementation of this Section 2.02 and Section 2.03) immediately prior to the Effective Time and the corresponding number of Shares underlying such Company Stock Options that such Person desires to have converted into the right to receive Parent Common Stock, subject to proration as described in Section 2.03(c) in the event the total number of Electing Shares and Net Electing Option Shares in the aggregate exceeds the Maximum Election Number (an " _Irrevocable Option Election_ "). Any such holder who fails properly to submit an Election Form on or before the Election Deadline in accordance with the procedures set forth in this Section 2.02(a)(ii) shall be deemed to have not made a Irrevocable Option Election and all of such holderÂ’s Company Stock Options shall be treated in accordance with Section 2.05(a). The aggregate number of Shares subject to a Irrevocable Option Election made pursuant to this Section 2.02(a)(ii) is referred to as the " _Gross Electing Option Shares_ ", and the " _Net Electing Option Shares_ " shall mean the aggregate number of Shares that would be issued in the event the Company Stock Options covering the Gross Electing Option Shares were exercised on a net share basis ( _i.e_., paying the exercise price of the Company Stock Options using the value of the shares of Common Stock underlying such Company Stock Options) at the Cash Election Price taking into account the exercise price and any required tax withholding. For the avoidance of doubt, and except for purposes of calculating the Proration Factor (as defined herein), Company Stock Options shall only be deemed exercised pursuant to this Section 2.02(a)(ii) (or the Election Form referred to herein) to the extent necessary to provide sufficient Net Electing Option Shares in order to satisfy the provisions of Sections 2.03(a), (b) and (c) hereof. 

  

 (b) _Appointment of Exchange Agent_. Prior to the mailing of the Proxy Statement (as defined herein), Parent shall appoint a bank or trust company reasonably acceptable to the Company to act as exchange agent (the " _Exchange Agent_ ") for the payment of the Merger Consideration. 

   

 (c) _Mailing of Election Form; Election Deadline_. Parent shall prepare and direct the Exchange Agent to mail a form of election, which form shall be subject to the reasonable approval of the Company (the " _Election Form_ "), with the Proxy Statement to the record holders of Company Common Stock and Company Stock Options as of the record date for the Company Meeting (the " _Election Form Record Date_"), which Election Form shall be used by each record holder of Shares who wishes to make a Parent Stock Election and by each holder of a Company Stock Option who wishes to make a Irrevocable Option Election; _provided_ that the Company and Parent shall use commercially reasonable efforts to mail or otherwise make available the Election Form and related materials to all Persons who become record holders of Company Common Stock or Company Stock Options during the period between the Election Form Record Date and the Election Deadline for use by such holders who desire to make a Parent Stock Election. Any such holderÂ’s Parent Stock Election or Irrevocable Option   ##### 

  

  

  

Election, as the case may be, shall have been properly made only if the
Exchange Agent shall have received at its designated office, by 5:00 p.m. New
York City time on the Business Day preceding the date of the Stockholders
Meeting (the " _Election Deadline_ "), an Election Form properly completed
and signed and, in the case of a Parent Stock Election, accompanied
by certificates for the Shares (unless such Shares are uncertificated) of
Company Common Stock to which such Election Form relates, duly endorsed in
blank or otherwise in form acceptable for transfer on the books of the
Company (or by an appropriate guarantee of delivery of such certificates as
set forth in such Election Form from a firm which is a registered
national securities exchange or of the National Association of Securities
Dealers, Inc. or by a commercial bank or trust company in the United States
as set forth in such Election Form, provided such certificates are in fact
delivered to the Exchange Agent within five NYSE trading days after the date
of execution of such guarantee of delivery). 

   

 (d) _Ability to Revoke Election Forms_. Any Election Form (other than in connection with an Irrevocable Option Election) may be revoked by the stockholder submitting it to the Exchange Agent only by written notice received by the Exchange Agent prior to the Election Deadline. All Election Forms shall automatically be revoked if the Exchange Agent is notified in writing by Parent and the Company the Merger has been abandoned and this Agreement has been terminated. If an Election Form is revoked, the certificate or certificates (or guarantees of delivery, as appropriate), if any, for the Shares to which such Election Form relates shall be promptly returned to the stockholder submitting the same to the Exchange Agent. 

   

 (e) _Determination of Exchange Agent Binding_. The determination of the Exchange Agent shall be binding as to whether a Parent Stock Election shall have been properly made or revoked pursuant to this Section 2.02 with respect to Shares and when elections and revocations were received by it. If the Exchange Agent determines that any Parent Stock Election was not properly made with respect to any Shares, such Shares shall be treated by the Exchange Agent as Shares which were not Electing Shares at the Effective Time, and, except as otherwise provided in this Agreement, such shares shall be exchanged in the Merger for the Cash Election Price pursuant to Section 2.01(a)(ii). If the Exchange Agent determines that any Irrevocable Option Election was not properly made with respect to any Company Stock Option, the Exchange Agent shall disregard such improper election and such Company Stock Option shall be treated in accordance with Section 2.05(a)). The Exchange Agent also shall make all computations as to the allocation and the proration contemplated by Section 2.03, and any such computation shall be conclusive and binding on the holders of Shares and Company Stock Options. The Exchange Agent may, with the mutual agreement of Parent and the Company, make such rules as are consistent with this Section 2.02 for the implementation of the elections provided for herein as shall be necessary or desirable fully to effect such elections. 

   

 Section 2.03 _Proration_. 

  

 (a) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, the maximum aggregate number of shares of Company Common Stock to be converted into the right to receive Parent Common Stock at the Effective Time, either pursuant to Parent Stock Elections or Irrevocable Option Elections, shall be equal to 8,333,333 (the " _Maximum Election Number_ "). 

    ##### 

  

     

 (b) If the total number of Electing Shares and Net Electing Option Shares, in the aggregate, is equal to or less than the Maximum Election Number, then (i) all Electing Shares shall be converted into the right to receive Parent Common Stock in accordance with the terms of Section 2.02(a)(i) and (ii) all Net Electing Option Shares shall be converted into the right to receive shares of Parent Common Stock through the exercise immediately prior to the Effective Time of the appropriate number of Company Stock Options subject to such holderÂ’s Irrevocable Option Election pursuant to Section 2.02(a)(ii). 

   

 (c) If the total number of Electing Shares and Net Electing Option Shares, in the aggregate, exceeds the Maximum Election Number, then the Electing Shares and the Net Electing Option Shares shall be converted into the right to receive Parent Common Stock or to receive cash in accordance with the terms of Section 2.01(a) or Section 2.05(a), as the case may be, in the following manner: 

    

 (i) A proration factor (the " _Proration Factor_ ") shall be determined by dividing the Maximum Election Number by the total number of Electing Shares and Net Electing Option Shares; 

   

 (ii) The number of Electing Shares covered by each holderÂ’s Parent Stock Election shall be converted into the right to receive such number of shares of Parent Common Stock as is equal to the product of (w) the Proration Factor _times_ (x) the total number of Electing Shares covered by such holderÂ’s Parent Stock Election (subject to the proviso in the following sentence). In addition, in the event that such holder also has made an Irrevocable Option Election, such holder shall have the right to receive an additional number of shares of Parent Common Stock as is equal to the product of (y) the Proration Factor _times_ (z) the total number of Net Electing Option Shares covered by such holderÂ’s Irrevocable Option Election; _provided_ that in the event that the total number of shares of Parent Common Stock such holder would be entitled to receive pursuant to this Section 2.03(c)(ii) exceeds the number of Electing Shares covered by such holderÂ’s Parent Stock Election (the amount of such excess, the " _Excess Shares_ "), then (A) all of such holderÂ’s Electing Shares shall be converted into Parent Common Stock and (B) the number of such holderÂ’s Net Electing Option Shares as is equal to the number of Excess Shares shall be converted into Parent Common Stock through the exercise of an appropriate number of Company Stock Options subject to such holderÂ’s Irrevocable Option Election pursuant to Section 2.02(a). 

   

 (iii) All Electing Shares, other than those shares converted into the right to receive Parent Common Stock in accordance with Section 2.03(b)(ii), shall be converted into cash, as if such Shares were not Electing Shares, in accordance with the terms of Section 2.01(a)(ii). 

   

 (iv) If a holder makes an Irrevocable Option Election but not a Parent Stock Election, then the number of such holderÂ’s Net Electing Option Shares as is equal to the product of (x) the Proration Factor _times_ (y) the total number of such holderÂ’s Net Electing Option Shares shall be converted into Parent Common stock through the exercise of an appropriate number of Company Stock Options subject to such holderÂ’s Irrevocable Option Election pursuant to Section 2.02(a). 

   ##### 

  

  

 (d) In the event that Parent (i) changes (or establishes a record date for changing) the number of shares of Parent Common Stock issued and outstanding prior to the Effective Time as a result of a stock split, stock dividend, stock combination, recapitalization, reclassification, reorganization or similar transaction with respect to the outstanding Parent Company Stock or (ii) pays or makes an extraordinary dividend or distribution in respect of Parent Common Stock (other than a distribution referred to in clause (i) of this sentence) and, in either case, the record date therefor is prior to the Effective Time, the number of shares of Parent Common Stock included in the Merger Consideration shall be proportionately adjusted. 

   

 Section 2.04 _Exchange of Shares for Merger Consideration_. 

  

 (a) _Exchange Agent_. At or immediately subsequent to the Effective Time, Parent shall deposit, or shall cause to be deposited, with the Exchange Agent, for the benefit of holders of the Shares, (i) cash in U.S. dollars sufficient to pay the aggregate cash portion of the Merger Consideration pursuant to Section 2.01(a) and (ii) certificates representing the shares of Parent Common Stock to be issued pursuant to Section 2.01(a) (such cash and certificates for shares of Parent Common Stock, together with any dividends or distributions with respect thereto, being hereinafter referred to as the " _Exchange Fund_ "). 

   

 (b) _Procedures for Surrendering Shares_. 

    

 (i) As soon as reasonably practicable after the Effective Time and in any event not later than the third Business Day following the Effective Time, the Exchange Agent shall mail to each holder of record of Shares whose Shares were converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration pursuant to Section 2.01 and whose Shares have not previously been surrendered with the Election Form (A) a letter of transmittal which shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the certificates that immediately prior to the Effective Time represented Shares (" _Certificates_ ") shall pass, only upon delivery of Certificates to the Exchange Agent (and shall be in such form and have such other provisions as Parent and the Company may reasonably determine prior to the Effective Time) and (B) instructions for use in effecting the surrender of Certificates (or effective affidavits of loss in lieu thereof) or non-certificated Shares represented by book-entry (" _Book-Entry Shares_ ") in exchange for the Merger Consideration. 

   

 (ii) Upon surrender of Certificates (or effective affidavits of loss in lieu thereof) or Book-Entry Shares to the Exchange Agent together with such letter of transmittal, duly completed and validly executed in accordance with the instructions thereto, and such other documents as may customarily be required by the Exchange Agent, the holder of such Certificates or Book-Entry Shares shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor the Merger Consideration into which the Shares represented by such Certificates (or effective affidavits of loss in lieu thereof) or Book-Entry Shares have been converted pursuant to this Agreement. In the event of a transfer of ownership of Shares that is not registered in the transfer or stock records of the Company, any cash to be paid upon, or shares of Parent Common Stock to be issued upon, due surrender of the Certificate formerly representing such Shares may be paid or issued, as the case may be, to such a transferee if such Certificate is presented to the Exchange Agent, accompanied 

   ##### 

  

    

by all documents required to evidence and effect such transfer and to
evidence that any applicable stock transfer or other similar Taxes have been
paid or are not applicable. 

   

 (iii) No interest will be paid or accrued for the benefit of holders of the Shares on the Merger Consideration payable upon the surrender of Shares pursuant to this Section 2.04. 

   

 (iv) No dividends or other distributions, if any, with a record date after the Effective Time with respect to Parent Common Stock shall be paid to the holder of any unsurrendered Share which is being converted into shares of Parent Common Stock pursuant to Section 2.01(a) until such holder shall surrender such Share in accordance with this Section 2.04. After the surrender of a Share in accordance with this Section 2.04, such holder thereof shall be entitled to receive any such dividends or other distributions, without any interest thereon, which theretofore had become payable with respect to whole shares of Parent Common Stock represented by such Share. 

   

 (v) The Surviving Corporation, Parent and the Paying Agent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the consideration otherwise payable under this Agreement to any Person such amounts as are required to be withheld or deducted under the Code, or any provision of U.S. state, local or foreign Tax Law with respect to the making of such payment. To the extent that amounts are so withheld or deducted and paid over to the applicable Governmental Entity, such withheld or deducted amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to such Person in respect of which such deduction and withholding were made. 

   

 (vi) Until surrendered as contemplated by this Section 2.04, each Share (other than any Dissenting Shares, Cancelled Shares and Remaining Shares) shall be deemed at any time after the Effective Time to represent only the right to receive upon such surrender the applicable Merger Consideration into which the Shares shall have been converted pursuant to Section 2.01. 

  

 (c) _Closing of Transfer Books_. At the Effective Time, the stock transfer books of the Company shall be closed, and there shall be no further registration of transfers on the stock transfer books of the Surviving Corporation of the Shares that were outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time. If, after the Effective Time, Certificates are presented to the Surviving Corporation or Parent for transfer, they shall be cancelled and exchanged for the proper Merger Consideration pursuant to and subject to the requirements of this Article II. 

   

 (d) _Termination of Exchange Fund_. Any portion of the Exchange Fund (including the proceeds of any investments in respect of the cash portion thereof) that remains undistributed to the former holders of Shares for one year after the Effective Time shall be delivered to the Surviving Corporation upon demand, and any former holders of Shares who have not surrendered their Shares in accordance with this Section 2.04 shall thereafter look only to the Surviving Corporation for payment of their claim for the Merger Consideration, without any interest thereon, upon due surrender of their Shares. 

    ##### 

  

     

 (e) _No Liability_. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, none of the Company, Parent, Merger Sub, the Surviving Corporation, the Paying Agent or any other person shall be liable to any former holder of Shares for any amount properly delivered to a public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar Law. If any Certificate shall not have been surrendered prior to the date on which the related Merger Consideration would, pursuant to applicable Law, escheat to or become the property of any Governmental Entity, any such Merger Consideration shall, to the extent permitted by applicable Law, immediately prior to such time, become the property of the Surviving Corporation, free and clear of all claims or interests of any Person previously entitled thereto. 

   

 (f) _Investment of Exchange Fund_. The cash deposited with the Exchange Agent pursuant to Section 2.04(a) and any earnings thereon shall be invested by the Exchange Agent as reasonably directed by Parent; _provided, however,_ that any investment of such cash shall in all events be limited to direct short-term obligations of, or short-term obligations fully guaranteed as to principal and interest by, the U.S. government, in commercial paper rated A-1 or P-1 or better by MoodyÂ’s Investors Service, Inc. or Standard and PoorÂ’s Corporation, respectively, and that no such investment or loss thereon shall affect the amounts payable to holders of Certificates or Book-Entry Shares pursuant to this Article II. Any profit or loss, or interest and other income resulting from such investments shall be for the account of Parent and be paid to Parent on the earlier of one year after the Effective Time or full payment of the Exchange Fund. 

   

 (g) _Lost Certificates_. In the case of any Certificate that has been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit, in form and substance reasonably acceptable to Parent, of that fact by the person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if required by Parent or the Paying Agent, the posting by such person of an indemnity agreement or, at the election of Parent or the Paying Agent, a bond in customary amount as indemnity against any claim that may be made against it or the Surviving Corporation with respect to such Certificate, the Paying Agent will deliver in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate an amount equal to the number of Shares represented by such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate multiplied by the Merger Consideration. 

   

 (h) _No Further Ownership Rights_. All Merger Consideration paid upon the surrender of Shares (or affidavits of loss in lieu thereof) in accordance with the terms of this Article II shall be deemed to have been paid in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to the Shares. 

   

 Section 2.05 _Effect of the Merger on Company Stock Options, Company Restricted Shares and RSUs_. 

  

 (a) Each outstanding option to acquire shares of Company Common Stock (each, a " _Company Stock Option_ "), whether or not then vested or exercisable, that is outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall, as of immediately prior to the Effective Time (and except for (x) Company Stock Options as to which the treatment in the Merger is hereafter separately agreed by Parent and the holder thereof in compliance with Section 5.01(c), which Company Stock Options shall be treated as so agreed and (y) Company Stock Options which are being exercised pursuant to an Irrevocable Option Election), become fully vested and, subject to   ##### 

  

  

  

the terms of the Company Stock Plans, be converted into the right to receive
a payment in cash, payable in U.S. dollars and without interest, equal to the
product of (i) the excess, if any, of (x) the Cash Election Price over (y)
the exercise price per share of Company Common Stock subject to such Company
Stock Option,  _multiplied by_ (ii) the number of shares of Company Common
Stock for which such Company Stock Option shall not theretofore have been
exercised. The Surviving Corporation shall pay the holders of Company Stock
Options the cash payments described in this Section 2.05(a) on or as soon
as reasonably practicable after the date on which the Effective Time occurs,
but in any event within two (2) Business Days thereafter. 

   

 (b) Immediately prior to the Effective Time, except as separately agreed by Parent and the holder thereof in compliance with Section 5.01(c), each award of restricted Company Common Stock (the " _Company Restricted Shares_ ") shall vest in full and be converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration in accordance with Section 2.01(a).

 Section 4.04 _Financing_. Section 4.04 of the Parent Disclosure Letter sets forth true, accurate and complete copies, as of the date of this Agreement, of (i) executed commitment 

   ##### 

  

    

letters to provide equity financing to Parent in an aggregate amount set

of equity financing, the " _Equity Financing_ ") and (ii) executed
debt commitment letters and related term sheets (the " _Debt Commitment
Letters_ " and together with the Equity Commitment Letters, the " _Financing
Commitments_ ") pursuant to which, and subject to the terms and conditions
thereof, certain lenders have committed to provide Parent or the Surviving
Corporation with funds (which may include up to $1,740,000,000 in bridge
financing (the " _Bridge Financing_ ") to be utilized in the event the
placement of high yield securities in a comparable amount (the " _High Yield
Financing_ ") is not consummated) in the amounts described therein, the
proceeds of which shall be used to consummate the Merger and the other
transactions contemplated hereby (the " _Debt Financing_ " and, together with
the Equity Financing, the " _Financing_ "). As of the date of this Agreement,
each of the Financing Commitments, in the form so delivered, is a legal,
valid and binding obligation of Parent or Merger Sub and, to the Knowledge of
Parent, of the other parties thereto. As of the date of this Agreement, the
Financing Commitments are in full force and effect and have not been
withdrawn or terminated (and no party thereto has indicated an intent to so
withdraw or terminate) or otherwise amended or modified in any respect and
neither Parent nor Merger Sub is in breach of any of the terms or conditions
set forth therein and, subject to the accuracy of the representations and
warranties of the Company set forth in Article III, no event has occurred
which, with or without notice, lapse of time or both, could reasonably be
expected to constitute a breach or failure to satisfy a condition precedent
set forth therein or a default thereunder. As of the date of this Agreement,
subject to the accuracy of the representations and warranties of the Company
set forth in Article III, neither Parent nor Merger Sub has any reason to
believe that it will be unable to satisfy on a timely basis any term or
condition contemplated to be satisfied by it contained in the Financing
Commitments. The proceeds from the Financing when funded in accordance with
the Financing Commitments, and together with value of the shares of Company
Common Stock and shares underlying Company Stock Options with respect to
which the Electing Stockholders have made a Parent Stock Election or an
Irrevocable Option Election, are sufficient for the satisfaction of all of
ParentÂ’s and Merger SubÂ’s obligations under this Agreement, including the
payment of the Merger Consideration and the consideration in respect of the
Company Stock Options, RSUs and Company Restricted Shares under Section 2.05
and to pay all related fees and expenses. As of the date of this Agreement,
Parent or Merger Sub has fully paid any and all commitment fees or other fees
on the dates and to the extent required by the Financing Commitments. The
Financing Commitments contain all of the conditions precedent to the
obligations of the parties thereunder to make the Financing available to
Parent. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, the Debt
Commitment Letters may be superseded at the option of Parent or Merger Sub
after the date of this Agreement but prior to the Effective Time by the
New Financing Commitments in accordance with Section 5.09. In such event, the
term "Financing Commitment" as used herein shall be deemed to include the New
Financing Commitments to the extent then in effect. 

  

 Section 4.05 _Ownership and Operations of Merger Sub; Issuance of Parent Common Stock_. 

  

 (a) As of the date of this Agreement, the authorized capital stock of Merger Sub consists of 1,000 shares of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, all of which are validly issued and outstanding. All of the issued and outstanding capital stock of Merger Sub is, and immediately prior to the Effective Time will be, owned by Parent. 

    ##### 

  

     

 (b) The shares of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of Parent (" _Parent Common Stock_ ") to be issued in exchange for the Electing Shares pursuant to this Agreement have been duly authorized and when issued in the Merger pursuant to the terms of this Agreement will be validly issued, fully paid, non-assessable and free of preemptive rights, with no personal liability attaching to the ownership thereof. All other shares of Parent Common Stock to be issued on or prior to the Closing Date in connection with the consummation of the Merger and the transactions contemplated thereby have been duly authorized, will be issued in exchange for consideration per share equal to $120.00 and when issued will be validly issued, fully paid, non-assessable and free of preemptive rights, with no personal liability attaching to the ownership thereof. 

   

 (c) The authorized capital stock of Parent consists of 60,000,000 shares of Parent Common Stock and, as of the date of this Agreement, 100 shares of Parent Common Stock were issued and outstanding. ParentÂ’s authorized capital stock does not consist of any shares of preferred stock or shares of a class of common stock other than Parent Common Stock. As of the date of this Agreement, KHI Holdings LP (" _Holdings_ ") is the sole stockholder of Parent. Neither Parent nor Holdings has entered into any Contract with any other holder of Parent Common Stock which provides any special consent rights to such other holder of Parent Common Stock. True and complete copies of the certificate of incorporation and by-laws of Parent are included in _Section 4.05(c)_ of the Parent Disclosure Letter. In the event that the amount of shares of Parent Common Stock issued to the CompanyÂ’s stockholders in accordance with the terms of this Agreement equals the Maximum Election Number and subject to proportionate adjustment if the equity financing at the Effective Time is greater or less than Equity Financing reflected in the Equity Commitment Letters, such amount of shares will represent approximately 27% of the outstanding shares of Parent Common Stock immediately following the Effective Time. 

   

 (d) Neither Parent nor Merger Sub has conducted any business other than incident to its formation and in relation to this Agreement, the Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby and the financing of such transactions. 

   

 Section 4.06 _Finders or Brokers_. Neither Parent nor any of its Subsidiaries has engaged any investment banker, broker or finder in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement who, if the Merger is not consummated, might be entitled to any fee or any commission from the Company. 

  

 Section 4.07 _Certain Arrangements_. Other than the Election Agreement, there are no Contracts or other understandings or arrangements between Parent, Merger Sub or any Guarantor or any of their respective Affiliates, on the one hand, and any member of the CompanyÂ’s management or directors, on the other hand, as of the date hereof that relate in any way to the Company, Parent or the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Neither Parent nor Merger Sub, alone or together with any other person, has been at any time, or became, an "interested shareholder" thereunder or has taken any action that would cause any anti-takeover statute under the DGCL to be applicable to this Agreement, the Merger, or any transactions contemplated by this Agreement. 

   ##### 

  

  

 Section 4.08 _Investigations; Litigation_. Except as may result from the announcement of the Merger or the proposal thereof or this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby, there are no suits, claims, actions, proceedings, arbitrations, mediations or investigations pending or, to the Knowledge of Parent, threatened against Parent or any of its Subsidiaries that would, individually or in the aggregate, have a Parent Material Adverse Effect. Neither Parent nor any of its Subsidiaries nor any of their respective properties is or are subject to any order, writ, judgment, injunction, decree or award that would, individually or in the aggregate, have a Parent Material Adverse Effect. 

  

 Section 4.09 _Guarantees_. Concurrently with the execution of this Agreement, Parent has caused the Guarantors to deliver to the Company duly executed Guarantees. The Guarantees are in full force and effect. 

  

 Section 4.10 _Solvency_. Immediately after giving effect to all of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including the Financing, any alternative financing and the payment of the aggregate Merger Consideration and the consideration in respect of the Company Stock Options, the RSUs and the Company Restricted Shares under Section 2.05 and any other repayment or refinancing of debt that may be contemplated in the Financing Commitments, assuming (a) satisfaction of the conditions to ParentÂ’s obligation to consummate the Merger as set forth herein, or the waiver of such conditions, and (b) the accuracy of the representations and warranties of the Company set forth in Article III hereof (for such purposes, such representations and warranties shall be true and correct in all material respects without giving effect to any knowledge, materiality or "Company Material Adverse Effect" qualification or exception) and (c) any estimates, projections or forecasts of the Company and its Subsidiaries have been prepared in good faith based upon reasonable assumptions, and payment of all related fees and expenses, the Surviving Corporation will be Solvent.

to such Superior Proposal; _provided, however_ that the Company shall not
terminate this Agreement pursuant to the foregoing clause (y), and any

_Company Employees_ ") annual base salary and base wages, cash incentive
compensation opportunities (excluding equity-based compensation) and aggregate
benefits, in each case, that are no less favorable than such annual base
salary and base wages, cash incentive compensation opportunities (excluding
equity-based compensation) and aggregate benefits provided to the Company
Employees immediately prior to the Effective Time. In furtherance of,
but without limiting the foregoing, Parent shall cause the Surviving
Corporation to amend, reform or supplement the terms of any nonqualified
deferred compensation plan (within the meaning of Section 409A of the Code
and related guidance) covering any Company Employee as necessary for
compliance with Section 409A, while preserving to the extent practicable the
intended treatment of the original plan. 

   

 (b) For all purposes (excluding for purposes of benefit accrual under any defined benefit pension plan) under the employee benefit plans of Parent and its Subsidiaries providing benefits to any Company Employees after the Effective Time (including the Company Benefits Plans) (the " _New Plans_ "), each Company Employee shall be credited with his or her years of service with the Company and its Subsidiaries and their respective predecessors before the Effective Time, to the same extent as such Company Employee was entitled, before the Effective Time, to credit for such service under any similar Company employee benefit plan in which such Company Employee participated or was eligible to participate immediately prior to the Effective Time, _provided_ that the foregoing shall not apply to the extent that its application would result in a duplication of benefits with respect to the same period of service. In addition, and without limiting the generality of the foregoing, to the extent legally permissible, (i) each Company Employee shall be immediately eligible to participate, without any waiting time, in any and all New Plans to the extent coverage under such New Plan is replacing comparable coverage under a Company Benefit Plan in which such Company Employee participated immediately before the Effective Time (such plans, collectively, the " _Old Plans_ "), and (ii) for purposes of each New Plan providing medical, dental, pharmaceutical and/or vision benefits to any Company Employee, Parent shall cause all pre-existing condition exclusions and actively-at-work requirements of such New Plan to be waived for such employee and his or her covered dependents, to the extent such conditions did not immediately prior to the Effective Time, apply to such employee and his or her covered dependents under the comparable Old Plans of the Company or its Subsidiaries in which such employee participated immediately prior to the Effective Time and Parent shall cause any eligible expenses incurred by such employee and his or her covered dependents during the portion of the plan year of the Old Plan ending on the date such employeeÂ’s participation in the corresponding New Plan begins to be taken into account under such New Plan for purposes of satisfying all deductible, coinsurance and maximum out-of-pocket requirements applicable to such employee and his or her covered dependents for the applicable plan year as if such amounts had been paid in accordance with such New Plan. 

   

 (c) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall take all action necessary to amend the Key Executive Officers Bonus Plan, without further liability to the Company, such that, notwithstanding anything contained herein to the contrary, the occurrence of the Closing   ##### 

  

  

  

shall not constitute a Change in Control under the terms of the plan to the
extent the Closing occurs after June 30, 2007. 

   

 (d) The Company may amend, reform or supplement the terms of any Compensation Benefit Plan as necessary for compliance with, or to avoid adverse tax consequences under Section 409A of the Code and related guidance. 

   

 (e) Upon the Effective Time, Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries to assume all Company Benefit Plans that require assumption by a successor to the Company in accordance with their terms as in effect immediately before the Effective Time. 

   

 (f) The provisions of this Section 5.04 are solely for the benefit of the parties to this Agreement, and no current or former employee, director or independent contractor or any other individual associated therewith shall be regarded for any purpose as a third-party beneficiary of the Agreement, and nothing herein shall be construed as an amendment to any Company Benefit Plan for any purpose. 

   

 Section 5.05 _Reasonable Best Efforts_. 

  

 (a) Subject to the terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement, each of the parties hereto shall use its reasonable best efforts to take, or to cause to be taken, all actions, to file, or cause to be filed, all documents and to do, or to cause to be done, and to assist and to cooperate with the other parties in doing, all things necessary, proper or advisable to consummate and make effective the Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby, including using reasonable best efforts to accomplish the following, (i) the obtaining of all necessary actions or nonactions, waivers, consents, clearances, approvals, and expirations or terminations of waiting periods, including the Company Approvals and the Parent Approvals, from Governmental Entities and the making of all necessary registrations and filings and the taking of all steps as may be necessary to obtain an approval, clearance, or waiver from, or to avoid an action or proceeding by, any Governmental Entity, (ii) the obtaining of all necessary consents, approvals or waivers from, or participation in other discussions or negotiations with, third parties and cooperating with the other party to obtain any consents or waivers reasonably requested by such other party in connection with the consummation of the Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby, (iii) the defending of any lawsuits or other legal proceedings, whether judicial or administrative, challenging this Agreement or the consummation of the Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby and (iv) the execution and delivery of any additional instruments reasonably necessary to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby; _provided, however,_ that in no event shall the Company or any of its Subsidiaries be required to pay prior to the Effective Time any fee, penalties or other consideration to any third party to obtain any consent or approval required for the consummation of the Merger under any Contract and neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries shall commit to the payment of any fee, penalty or other consideration in connection with obtaining any consent without the prior written consent of Parent. 

   

 (b) Subject to the terms and conditions herein provided and without limiting the foregoing, the Company and Parent shall (i) promptly, but in no event later than ten Business   #####

transactions contemplated hereby, and use reasonable best efforts to cause
the expiration or termination of any applicable waiting periods under the HSR

Agreement and the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby and
(y) timely making all such filings and timely obtaining all such consents,

as may be necessary to resolve such objections, if any, as the United States

Department of Justice, state antitrust enforcement authorities or competition
authorities of any other nation or other jurisdiction or any other person may
assert under any Regulatory Law with respect to the Merger and the other
transactions contemplated hereby, and (B) avoid or eliminate each and
every impediment under any Law that may be asserted by any Governmental
Entity with respect to the Merger so as to enable the Closing to occur no

and effecting, by consent decree, hold separate order or otherwise, the sale,
divestiture or disposition of any assets or businesses of Parent or its
Subsidiaries or Affiliates or of the Company or its Subsidiaries and (y)

would limit the freedom of Parent or its SubsidiariesÂ’ (including the
Surviving CorporationÂ’s) or AffiliatesÂ’ freedom of action with respect to, or
its ability to retain, one or more of its or its SubsidiariesÂ’ (including the
Surviving CorporationÂ’s) or AffiliatesÂ’ businesses, product lines or assets,
in each case as may be required in order to avoid the entry of, or to effect
the dissolution of, any injunction, temporary restraining order or
other order in any suit or proceeding which would otherwise have the effect
of preventing the Closing or delaying the Closing beyond the End Date;
_provided_ that, neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries shall, nor
shall Parent or any of its Subsidiaries or Affiliates be obligated to, become
subject to, or consent or agree to or otherwise take any action with respect
to, any requirement, condition, understanding, agreement or order of a
Governmental Entity to sell, to hold separate or otherwise dispose of, or to
conduct, restrict, operate, invest or otherwise change the assets or business
of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or Parent or any of its
Subsidiaries or Affiliates, as the case may be, unless such requirement,
condition, understanding, agreement or order is binding on the Company or
Parent, its Subsidiaries or Affiliates, respectively, only in the event that
the Closing occurs; _provided further, however_ , that in no event shall any
member or other holder of interests in Parent, or any Affiliate or any member
of Parent, be required to take any action with respect to any portfolio
company or agree to undertake any divestiture or restrict its conduct with
regard to any business other than the business of the Company and
its Subsidiaries. 

   

 (c) Subject to applicable legal limitations and the instructions of any Governmental Entity, the Company and Parent shall keep each other reasonably apprised of the   ##### 

  

  

  

status of matters relating to the completion of the Merger and the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including promptly furnishing
the other with copies of notices or other written communications received by
the Company or Parent, as the case may be, or any of their respective
Subsidiaries or Affiliates, from any third party and/or any Governmental
Entity with respect to such Merger or transactions. The Company and Parent
shall permit counsel for the other party reasonable opportunity to review in
advance, and consider in good faith the views of the other party
in connection with, any proposed written communication to any Governmental
Entity. To the extent practicable under the circumstances, each of the
Company and Parent agrees not to participate in any substantive meeting or
discussion, either in person or by telephone, with any Governmental Entity in
connection with the proposed transactions unless it consults with the other
party in advance and, to the extent not prohibited by such Governmental
Entity, gives the other party the opportunity to attend and participate. 

   

 (d) In furtherance and not in limitation of the covenants of the parties contained in this Section 5.05, if any administrative or judicial action or proceeding, including any proceeding by a private party, is instituted (or threatened to be instituted) challenging the Merger or any other transaction contemplated by this Agreement as violative of any Regulatory Law, each of the Company and Parent shall cooperate in all reasonable respects with each other and shall use its respective reasonable best efforts to contest and resist any such action or proceeding and to have vacated, lifted, reversed or overturned any decree, judgment, injunction or other order, whether temporary, preliminary or permanent, that is in effect and that prohibits, prevents or restricts consummation of the Merger or any other transaction contemplated hereby. 

   

 (e) For purposes of this Agreement, " _Regulatory Law_ " means any and all state, federal and foreign statutes, rules, regulations, orders, decrees, administrative and judicial doctrines and other Laws requiring notice to, filings with, or the consent, clearance or approval of, any Governmental Entity, or that otherwise may cause any restriction, in connection with the Merger and the transactions contemplated thereby, including (i) the Sherman Act of 1890, the Clayton Antitrust Act of 1914, the HSR Act, the Federal Trade Commission Act of 1914 and all other Laws that are designed or intended to prohibit, restrict or regulate actions having the purpose or effect of monopolization or restraint of trade or lessening competition through merger or acquisition, (ii) any Law governing the direct or indirect ownership or control of any of the operations or assets of the Company and its Subsidiaries or (iii) any Law with the purpose of protecting the national security or the national economy of any nation.

   #####

or other public statement or comment relating to this Agreement or the
transactions contemplated herein and shall not issue any such press release
or other public statement or comment prior to such consultation except as may
be required by applicable Law or by obligations pursuant to any listing
agreement with any national securities exchange. Parent and the Company agree
that the press release announcing the execution and delivery of this
Agreement shall be a joint release of Parent and the Company. 

   

 Section 5.08 _Indemnification and Insurance_. 

  

 (a) Parent and Merger Sub agree that all rights to exculpation, indemnification and advancement of expenses for acts or omissions occurring at or prior to the Effective Time, whether asserted or claimed prior to, at or after the Effective Time, now existing in favor of the current or former directors, officers or employees, as the case may be, of the Company or its Subsidiaries as provided in their respective certificates of incorporation or by-laws or other organization documents or in any agreement as in effect on the date hereof and which has previously been made available to Parent or its Representatives shall survive the Merger and shall continue in full force and effect to the extent provided in the following sentence. Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall maintain in effect any and all exculpation, indemnification and advancement of expenses provisions of the CompanyÂ’s and any of its SubsidiariesÂ’ certificates of incorporation, by-laws or similar organization documents in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time or in any indemnification agreements of the Company or its Subsidiaries with any of their respective current or former directors, officers or employees in effect as of the date of this Agreement and which has previously been made available to Parent or its Representatives, and shall not (except as otherwise required by Law), for a period of six years from the date hereof, amend, repeal or otherwise modify any such provisions in any manner that would adversely affect the rights thereunder of any individuals who at the Effective Time were current or former directors, officers or employees of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries and all rights to indemnification or advancement of expenses thereunder in respect of any Action pending or asserted or any claim made within such period shall continue until the disposition of such Action or resolution of such claim. 

   

 (b) From and after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall, Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, and in the event the coverage under the directorsÂ’ and officersÂ’ liability insurance policies referred to in Section 5.08(c) below has been fully paid by all applicable carriers or is otherwise no longer available, Parent shall, in each case to the fullest extent permitted under applicable Law, indemnify and hold harmless (and advance funds in respect of each of the foregoing) each current and former director, officer or employee of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries (each, together with such personÂ’s heirs, executors or administrators, an " _Indemnified Party_ ") against any costs or expenses (including advancing reasonable attorneysÂ’ fees and expenses in advance of the final disposition of any claim, suit, proceeding or investigation to each Indemnified Party to the fullest extent permitted by Law upon the receipt of any customary undertaking required by the Surviving Corporation), judgments, fines, losses, claims, damages, liabilities and amounts paid in settlement in connection with any actual or threatened claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative (an " _Action_ "), arising out of, relating to or in connection with any action or omission occurring or alleged to have occurred whether before or   ##### 

  

  

  

at the Effective Time in connection with such persons serving as an officer,
director or other fiduciary in any entity if such service was at the request
or for the benefit of the Company. 

   

 (c) For a period of six (6) years from the Effective Time, Parent shall either cause to be maintained in effect the current policies of directorsÂ’ and officersÂ’ liability insurance and fiduciary liability insurance maintained by the Company and its Subsidiaries or cause to be provided substitute policies or purchase or cause the Surviving Corporation to purchase, a "tail policy," in either case of at least the same coverage and amounts containing terms and conditions that are not less advantageous in the aggregate than such policy with respect to matters arising on or before the Effective Time; _provided, however,_ that after the Effective Time, Parent shall not be required to pay with respect to such insurance policies in respect of any one policy year annual premiums in excess of 300% of the last annual premium paid by the Company prior to the date hereof (which annual amount the Company represents and warrants is set forth on _Section 5.08(c)_ of the Company Disclosure Letter) in respect of the coverage required to be obtained pursuant hereto, but in such case shall purchase as much coverage as reasonably practicable for such amount;  _provided, further,_ that if the Surviving Corporation purchases a "tail policy" and the coverage thereunder costs more than 300% of such last annual premium, the Surviving Corporation shall purchase the maximum amount of coverage that can be obtained for 300% of such last annual premium. At the CompanyÂ’s option, the Company may purchase, prior to the Effective Time, a six-year pre-paid "tail policy" on terms and conditions (in both amount and scope) providing substantially equivalent benefits as the current policies of directorsÂ’ and officersÂ’ liability insurance and fiduciary liability insurance maintained by the Company and its Subsidiaries with respect to matters arising on or before the Effective Time, covering without limitation the transactions contemplated hereby. 

   

 (d) The rights of each Indemnified Party hereunder shall be in addition to, and not in limitation of, any other rights such Indemnified Party may have under the Company Charter, the by-laws or other similar organization documents of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or the Surviving Corporation, any other indemnification agreement or arrangement, the DGCL or otherwise. The provisions of this Section 5.08 shall survive the consummation of the Merger and, notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement that may be to the contrary, expressly are intended to benefit, and are enforceable by, each of the Indemnified Parties. 

   

 (e) In the event Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any of their respective successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any other Person and shall not be the continuing or surviving corporation or entity in such consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers all or substantially all of its properties and assets to any person, then, and in either such case, proper provision shall be made so that the successors and assigns of Parent or the Surviving Corporation, as the case may be, shall assume all of the obligations set forth in this Section 5.08. The agreements and covenants contained herein shall not be deemed to be exclusive of any other rights to which any Indemnified Party is entitled, whether pursuant to Law, contract or otherwise. Nothing in this Agreement is intended to, shall be construed to or shall release, waive or impair any rights to directorsÂ’ and officersÂ’ insurance claims under any policy that is or has been in existence with respect to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or their respective officers, directors and employees, it being understood and agreed that the indemnification   ##### 

  

  

  

provided for in this Section 5.08 is not prior to, or in substitution for,
any such claims under any such policies. 

   

 Section 5.09 _Financing_. 

  

 (a) Parent shall use its reasonable best efforts to obtain the Financing on the terms and conditions described in the Financing Commitments or terms that would not adversely impact the ability of Parent or Merger Sub to timely consummate the transactions contemplated hereby, including using its reasonable best efforts (i) to maintain in effect the Financing Commitments and to negotiate definitive agreements with respect thereto on the terms and conditions contained in the Financing Commitments (or other terms that would not adversely impact the ability of Parent or Merger Sub to timely consummate the transactions contemplated hereby), (ii) to satisfy all conditions precedent to the obligations of the parties thereunder to make the Financing in such definitive agreements available to Parent and consummate the Financing at or prior to the Closing, (iii) to comply with its obligations under the Financing Commitments and (iv) to enforce its rights under the Financing Commitments. Parent shall give the Company prompt notice upon becoming aware of any material breach by any party of the Financing Commitments or any termination of the Financing Commitments. Parent shall keep the Company informed on a reasonably current basis and in reasonable detail of the status of its efforts to arrange the Financing and provide to the Company copies of all documents related to the Financing to the extent such documents contain any additional conditions precedent not set forth in the Debt Commitment Letters to the obligations of the parties thereunder to make the Financing available to Parent and consummate the Financing at or prior to the Closing (it being understood that no such document will contain any such conditions precedent that would have any of the effects described in clauses (1)-(4) of the following sentence). In connection with its obligations under this Section 5.09, Parent shall be permitted to amend, modify or replace the Debt Commitment Letters with new Debt Commitment Letters (the " _New Financing Commitments_ "), _provided_ that Parent shall not permit any replacement of, or amendment or modification to be made to, or any waiver of any material provision or remedy under, the Debt Commitment Letter if such replacement, amendment, modification, waiver or remedy (1) reduces the aggregate amount of the Debt Financing below that amount required to consummate the Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby, (2) adversely amends or expands the conditions to the drawdown of the Debt Financing in any respect that would make such conditions less likely to be satisfied by the End Date or that would expand the possible circumstances under which such conditions would not be satisfied by such date, (3) can reasonably be expected to delay the Closing, or (4) is otherwise adverse to the interests of the Company in any material respect; and _provided, further,_ that nothing in this Section 5.09 shall be deemed to excuse, waive compliance with or modify any of the obligations set forth in the Confidentiality Agreement. In the event that all conditions to the Financing Commitments (other than, in connection with the Debt Financing, the availability or funding of any of the Equity Financing) have been satisfied, Parent shall, from and after the final day of the Marketing Period and subject to the satisfaction of the conditions set forth in Sections 6.01 and 6.03 hereof, use its reasonable best efforts to cause the lenders and other Persons providing such Financing to fund the Financing required to consummate the Merger on the Closing Date. In the event that Parent becomes aware of any event or circumstance that makes procurement of any portion of the Financing unlikely to occur in the manner or from the sources contemplated in the Financing Commitments or generally less likely as on the date of this Agreement, Parent shall notify the   ##### 

  

  

  

Company and shall use its reasonable best efforts to arrange as promptly as
practicable, but in no event later than one day prior to the Closing Date, any
such portion from alternative debt financing sources on terms and conditions
no less favorable to Parent or Merger Sub and no more adverse to the ability
of Parent to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (in
each case, as determined in the reasonable judgment of Parent). In the event
that on the final day of the Marketing Period (1) all or any portion of the
Debt Financing structured as High Yield Financing has not been consummated,
(2) all closing conditions in Sections 6.01, 6.03(a) and 6.03(b) shall have
been satisfied or waived (other than those conditions that by their nature
will not be satisfied until the Closing) and (3) the Bridge Financing (or
alternative bridge financing obtained in accordance with the preceding
sentence) is available substantially on the terms and conditions described in
the Debt Commitment Letters (or replacements thereof as contemplated by the
preceding sentence), then Merger Sub shall borrow under and use the proceeds
of the Bridge Financing (or such alternative bridge financing) to replace
such affected portion of the High Yield Financing no later than the last day
of the Marketing Period. For purposes of this Agreement, " _Marketing Period_
" shall mean the first period of 20 consecutive Business Days after the date
hereof throughout which (x) Parent shall have all of the Required Information
(as defined below) and during which period such information shall
remain compliant at all times with applicable provisions of Regulation S-X
and Regulation S-K under the Securities Act and (y) the conditions set forth
in Section 6.01 shall be satisfied and nothing has occurred and no condition
exists that would cause any of the conditions set forth in Sections 6.03(a)
or (b) to fail to be satisfied assuming the Closing were to be scheduled for
any day during such 20 Business Day period; _provided_ that, if the
Marketing Period would not end (i) on or prior to July 31, 2007, the
Marketing Period shall commence no earlier than the later of (A) September
4, 2007 and (B) the date the CompanyÂ’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the
fiscal year ended June 30, 2007 is filed with the SEC, and (ii) on or prior
to December 20, 2007, the Marketing Period shall commence no earlier than
January 2, 2008. 

   

 (b) The Company shall provide, shall cause its Subsidiaries to provide, and shall use reasonable best efforts to cause its Representatives, including legal and accounting, to provide, all cooperation reasonably requested by Parent in connection with the arrangement of the Financing and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement ( _provided_ that such requested cooperation does not unreasonably interfere with the ongoing operations of the Company and its Subsidiaries), including (i) furnishing Parent and Merger Sub and their Financing sources as promptly as practicable (and in any event no later than 30 days prior to the End Date) with financial and other pertinent information regarding the Company and its Subsidiaries as may be reasonably requested by Parent, including all financial statements and financial and other data of the type required by Regulation S-X (other than Item 3-10 of Regulation S-X, but including summary guarantor/non-guarantor information of the type customarily included in offering documents used in private placements under Rule 144A of the Securities Act) and Regulation S-K under the Securities Act and of the type and form customarily included in offering documents used in private placements under Rule 144A of the Securities Act (including, to the extent applicable with respect to such financial statements, the report of the CompanyÂ’s auditors thereon and related management discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations), to consummate the offerings of debt securities contemplated by the Debt Commitment Letters at the time during the CompanyÂ’s fiscal year such offerings will be made (information required to be delivered pursuant to this clause (i) being referred to as, the " _Required Information_ "), (ii) participating in meetings, presentations, road   ##### 

  

  

  

shows, due diligence sessions, drafting sessions and sessions with rating
agencies in connection with the Financing, (iii) assisting with the
preparation of materials for rating agency presentations, offering documents,
private placement memoranda, bank information memoranda, prospectuses and
similar documents required in connection with the Financing (including the
execution and delivery of one or more customary representation letters in
connection therewith); _provided_ that any private placement memoranda or
prospectuses in relation to high yield debt securities need not be issued by
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, and _provided_ ,  _further_ , that
any private placement memoranda or prospectuses shall contain disclosure
and financial statements reflecting the Surviving Corporation and/or its
Subsidiaries as the obligor, (iv) reasonably cooperating with the marketing
efforts for any of the Financing, including providing assistance in the
preparation for, and participating in, meetings, due diligence sessions and
similar presentations to and with, among others, prospective lenders,
investors and rating agencies, (v) providing monthly financial statements
(excluding footnotes) to the extent the Company customarily prepares such
financial statements, (vi) facilitating the entrance into one or more credit
or other agreements satisfactory to Parent in connection with the Debt
Financing to the extent direct borrowings or debt incurrences by the Company
or its Subsidiaries are contemplated by the Debt Commitment Letters, provided
that neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries shall be required to
enter into any such agreement prior to the Effective Time (vii) facilitating
the consummation of the Financing and the direct borrowing or incurrence of
all proceeds of the Debt Financing, including any high yield financing, by
the Surviving Corporation immediately following the Effective Time, (viii)
taking all actions reasonably necessary to (A) permit the prospective lenders
involved in the Financing to evaluate the CompanyÂ’s current assets, cash
management and accounting systems, policies and procedures relating thereto
for the purpose of establishing collateral arrangements (including conducting
field examination and appraisals contemplated by the Debt Commitment Letters
within the time frame described therein) and (B) establish bank and
other accounts and blocked account agreements and lock box arrangements in
connection with the foregoing, and (ix) executing and delivering (or using
reasonable best efforts to obtain from advisors), and causing its
Subsidiaries to execute and deliver (or use reasonable best efforts to obtain
from advisors or such other persons, including officers), customary
certificates (including a certificate of the chief financial officer of the
Surviving Corporation with respect to solvency matters), accounting comfort
letters, legal opinions (which may be reasoned if circumstances require),
hedging agreements (which shall have no liability to the Company in the event
the Merger is not consummated), surveys, title insurance policies (to the
extent in possession of, or otherwise reasonably obtainable by, the Company
or its Subsidiaries) or (x) facilitating the entrance into other documents
and instruments relating to guarantees, the pledge of collateral and other
matters ancillary to the Financing as may be reasonably requested by Parent in
connection with the Financing and otherwise reasonably facilitating the
pledge of collateral and providing of guarantees contemplated by the Debt
Commitment Letter (provided that the Company and its Subsidiaries shall not
be required to enter into any such document or instrument prior to
the Effective Time); _provided, however,_ that, except for fees and
liabilities subject to reimbursement or indemnification pursuant to the next
sentence, no obligation of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries under any
such certificate, document or instrument (other than the
representation letter referred to above) shall be effective until the
Effective Time and, except for fees and liabilities subject to reimbursement
or indemnification pursuant to the next sentence, none of the Company or any
of its Subsidiaries shall be required to pay any commitment or other similar
fee   ##### 

  

  

  

or incur any other liability in connection with the Financing prior to the
Effective Time. The Company hereby consents to the use of its and its
SubsidiariesÂ’ logos in connection with the Financing; _provided_ that such
logos are used solely in a manner that is not intended to or reasonably
likely to harm or disparage the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or the
reputation or goodwill of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries. Parent
shall promptly, upon request by the Company, reimburse the Company for all
reasonable out-of-pocket costs (including reasonable attorneysÂ’ fees)
incurred by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries in connection with
the cooperation of the Company and its Subsidiaries contemplated by this
Section 5.09 and shall indemnify and hold harmless the Company, its
Subsidiaries and their respective Representatives from and against any and
all losses, damages, claims, costs or expenses suffered or incurred by any
of them in connection with the arrangement of the Financing and any
information used in connection therewith, except with respect to any

 (c) In no event shall Parent, Merger Sub or any of its Affiliates (which for purposes of this Section 5.09(c) shall be deemed to include each direct or indirect investor in Parent, or any of ParentÂ’s or any such investorÂ’s financing sources or potential financing sources or other Representatives) enter into any Contract, arrangement or understanding with any bank or investment bank or other provider of debt or equity financing on an exclusive basis (or otherwise which Contract, arrangement or understanding by its terms could reasonably be expected to prevent such provider from providing or seeking to provide financing to any third party in connection with a transaction relating to the Company or its Subsidiaries); _provided, however,_ that notwithstanding the foregoing or anything contained in the Confidentiality Agreement or herein to the contrary, Parent, Merger Sub and any of its Affiliates may: (i) at any time, (A) seek to obtain or obtain equity commitments and equity financing on an exclusive or non-exclusive basis from the Parent Limited Partners and Persons under common management of KKR, (B) seek to obtain or obtain equity commitments and equity financing from (x) any Person under the common management of a Person who delivered the Equity Commitment Letters attached hereto and (y) any other Person (other than Persons principally involved in the private equity business), in each case on a non-exclusive basis and (C) engage additional providers of debt financing on a non-exclusive basis as members of the syndicate; _provided_ that prior to the No-Shop Period Start Date no such additional providers of debt financing may be awarded any lead book-runner, agent or arranger, book-running lead underwriter role or advisory role (it being agreed that such additional providers may, however, be given the role of senior managing agents); and (ii) following the No-Shop Period Start Date (without limiting the rights of Parent, Merger Sub or their Affiliates pursuant to the preceding clause (i)), (A) seek to obtain or obtain equity commitments and equity financing on an exclusive or non-exclusive basis from any Person other than (x) any Person who is an Excluded Party that the Company identifies in writing to Parent by name and (y) any Person principally involved in the private equity business that has aggregate uninvested equity commitments of at least $5,000,000,000, and (B) engage up to two additional providers of debt financing (such Persons may serve as lead book-runner, agent or arranger, book-running lead underwriter or financial advisor) on an exclusive basis, in each case in connection with the Merger or the other transactions contemplated hereby; _provided_ that (1) in the case of each of the foregoing, taking such actions does not expand upon the conditions precedent to the Financing as set forth in the Financing Commitments or prevent, impair or materially delay the availability of the Financing under the Financing Commitments or the Closing or (2) in the case of obtaining additional sources of equity financing (which for purposes 

     ##### 

 

  

of this clause (2) includes any transfer or assignment under any Equity
Commitment Letter), the satisfaction of the condition set forth in Section
6.01(c) hereof shall not be impaired or delayed and the consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby shall not be otherwise impaired or delayed.
In order to give effect to the foregoing agreement, subject to the conditions
of this Section 5.09(c), the Company hereby releases KKR from its

   ##### 

  

 

satisfaction of those conditions being materially delayed in violation of any
provision of this Agreement; _provided, however,_ that the delivery of any
notice pursuant to this Section 5.12 shall not (x) cure any breach of, or
non-compliance with, any other provision of this Agreement or (y) limit the
remedies available to the party receiving such notice; and, _provided,
further,_ that the failure to give prompt notice hereunder pursuant to clause
(iii) shall not constitute a failure of a condition to the Merger set forth
in Article VI except to the extent that the underlying fact or circumstance
not so notified would standing alone constitute such a failure. The Company
shall notify Parent, on a reasonably current basis, of any events or changes
with respect to any regulatory investigation or action involving the Company
or any of its Subsidiaries, and shall reasonably cooperate with Parent or its
Affiliates in efforts to mitigate any adverse consequences to Parent or its

 Section 5.14 _Control of Operations_. Without in any way limiting any partyÂ’s rights or obligations under this Agreement, the parties understand and agree that (i) nothing contained in this Agreement shall give Parent, directly or indirectly, the right to control or direct the CompanyÂ’s operations prior to the Effective Time, and (ii) prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall exercise, consistent with the terms and conditions of this Agreement, complete control and supervision over its operations. 

  

 Section 5.15 _Certain Transfer Taxes_. Any liability arising out of any real estate transfer Tax with respect to interests in real property owned directly or indirectly by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries immediately prior to the Merger, if applicable and due with respect to the Merger, shall be borne by the Surviving Corporation and expressly shall not be a liability of stockholders of the Company. 

  

 Section 5.16 _Obligations of Merger Sub_. Parent shall take all action necessary to cause Merger Sub and the Surviving Corporation to perform their respective obligations under this Agreement, the Financing Commitments and any New Financing Commitments.

 In the event of termination of this Agreement pursuant to this Section 7.01, this Agreement shall forthwith become null and void and there shall be no liability or obligation on the part of the Company, Parent, Merger Sub or their respective Subsidiaries or Affiliates, except that the Confidentiality Agreement, the Guarantees (only to the extent reflected therein) and the provisions of Section 7.02, the last sentence of Section 5.09(b) and Article VIII will survive the termination hereof; _provided_ , _however_ , that, without limiting the right to receive any payment pursuant to Section 7.02, the Company agrees that, to the extent it has incurred losses or damages in connection with this Agreement, the maximum aggregate liability of Parent and 

   ##### 

  

 

Merger Sub shall be limited to an amount equal to the aggregate amount of the

Parent pursuant to Section 7.01(d)(ii) in a circumstance in which the event
giving rise to the right of termination is based on the submission of a

Termination Fee shall mean an amount equal to $75,000,000. 

    ##### 

  

     

 (b) In the event that: 

    

 (i) the Company shall terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 7.01(c)(i) and at the time of such termination there is no state of facts or circumstances that would reasonably be expected to cause the conditions in Section 6.01, Section 6.03(a) or Section 6.03(b) not to be satisfied on the End Date, or 

   

 (ii) the Company shall terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 7.01(c)(iii);

Any payment required to be made pursuant to Section 7.02(b) shall be made to the Company promptly following termination of this Agreement by the Company (and in any event not later than two Business Days after delivery to Parent of notice of demand for payment), and such payment shall be made by wire transfer of immediately available funds to an account to be designated by the Company. 

   

 (d) In the event that this Agreement is terminated by Parent, on the one hand, or the Company, on the other hand, pursuant to Section 7.01(b)(iii) or by Parent pursuant to Section 7.01(d)(i) under circumstances in which the Termination Fee is not payable pursuant to this Section 7.02, then the Company shall promptly, but in no event later than five Business Days after being notified of such by Parent, pay Parent all of the reasonable documented out-of-pocket expenses incurred by Parent or Merger Sub in connection with this Agreement and the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (including the Financing) up to a maximum amount of $20,000,000 (the " _Parent Expenses_ "), by wire transfer of same day funds; _provided_ , that the existence of circumstances which could require the Termination Fee to become subsequently payable by the Company pursuant to Section 7.02(b) shall not relieve the Company of its obligations to pay the Parent Expenses pursuant to this Section 7.02(d); and  _provided, further_ that the payment by the Company of Parent Expenses pursuant to this Section 7.02(d) shall not 

  ##### 

  

    

relieve the Company of any subsequent obligation to pay the Termination
Fee pursuant to Section 7.02(b) except to the extent indicated in Section
7.02(b). 

   

 (e) In the event that the Company shall fail to pay the Termination Fee or Parent Expenses, or Parent shall fail to pay the Parent Termination Fee, required pursuant to this Section 7.02 when due, such fee and/or expenses shall accrue interest for the period commencing on the date such fee or expenses, as the case may be, became past due, at a rate equal to the rate of interest publicly announced by JPMorgan Chase Bank from time to time during such period, as such bankÂ’s prime lending rate. In addition, if either party shall fail to pay such fee or expenses when due, such owing party shall also pay to the owed party all of the owed partyÂ’s costs and expenses (including reasonable attorneysÂ’ fees) in connection with efforts to collect such fee or expenses. Each of Parent and the Company acknowledges that the fees and the other provisions of this Section 7.02 are an integral part of the Merger and that, without these agreements, Parent, Merger Sub and the Company would not enter into this Agreement. 

   

 (f) Each of the parties hereto acknowledges that the agreements contained in this Section 7.02 are an integral part of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and that neither the Termination Fee nor the Parent Termination Fee is a penalty, but rather is liquidated damages in a reasonable amount that will compensate Parent and Merger Sub or the Company, as the case may be, in the circumstances in which such Termination Fee is payable for the efforts and resources expended and opportunities foregone while negotiating this Agreement and in reliance on this Agreement and on the expectation of the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby, which amount would otherwise be impossible to calculate with precision. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, the CompanyÂ’s right to receive payment of the Parent Termination Fee from Parent pursuant to this Section 7.02 or the guarantee thereof pursuant to the Guarantees shall be the sole and exclusive remedy of the Company and its Subsidiaries against Parent, Merger Sub, the Guarantors and any of their respective former, current or future general or limited partners, stockholders, managers, members, directors, officers, Affiliates or agents for the loss suffered as a result of the failure of the Merger to be consummated, and upon payment of such amount, none of Parent, Merger Sub, the Guarantors or any of their former, current or future general or limited partners, stockholders, managers, members, directors, officers, Affiliates or agents shall have any further liability or obligation relating to or arising out of this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby.
