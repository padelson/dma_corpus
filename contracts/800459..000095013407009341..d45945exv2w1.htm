were not Electing Shares at the Effective Time, and, except as otherwise provided in this
Agreement, such shares shall be exchanged in the Merger for the Cash Election Price pursuant to

properly made with respect to any Company Stock Option, the Exchange Agent shall disregard such
improper election and such Company Stock Option shall be treated in accordance with Section
2.05(a)). The Exchange Agent also shall make all computations as to the allocation and the
proration contemplated by Section&nbsp;2.03, and any such computation shall be conclusive and binding on
the holders of Shares and Company Stock Options. The Exchange Agent may, with the mutual agreement
of Parent and the Company, make such rules as are consistent with this Section&nbsp;2.02 for the
