days after the delivery of the Objections Statement to Buyer, Seller and Buyer shall submit any
unresolved Disputed Items to KPMG LLP (the &#147;<U>Accounting Firm</U>&#148;). In the event the parties

Statement (which in the case of each party may be a Closing Statement that, with respect to the
unresolved Disputed Items (but not, for the avoidance of doubt, with respect to any other items),
is different than the Closing Statement initially submitted to Seller, or the Objections Statement
delivered to Buyer, as applicable) together with such supporting documentation as it deems
appropriate, to the Accounting Firm within thirty (30)&nbsp;days after the date on which such unresolved
Disputed Items were submitted to the Accounting Firm for resolution. Seller and Buyer shall use
their respective commercially reasonable efforts to cause the Accounting Firm to resolve such
dispute as soon as practicable, but in any event within thirty (30)&nbsp;days after the date on which
the Accounting Firm receives the Closing Statements prepared by Seller and Buyer. The Accounting
Firm shall resolve such dispute by choosing the Closing Statement proposed by either Seller or
Buyer or amounts within the range between the amounts set forth in the Closing Statement prepared
by Seller and the Closing Statement prepared by Buyer, and shall make no other resolution of such
dispute. Seller and Buyer shall use their respective commercially reasonable efforts to cause the
Accounting Firm to notify them in writing of its resolution of such dispute as soon as practicable.
The Closing Statement selected by the Accounting Firm shall be final, binding and non-appealable
by the parties hereto. Each party shall bear its own costs and expenses in connection with the
resolution of such dispute by the Accounting Firm. The Accounting Firm shall allocate its costs
and expenses between Buyer and Seller based upon a percentage for each party calculated to be what
the portion of the contested amount not awarded to such party bears to the amount actually
contested by such party. For example, if Buyer claims that Net Working Capital is $1,000 less than
the amount of Net Working Capital set forth in the Closing Statement, and
Seller contests only $500 of the amount claimed by Buyer, and if the Accounting Firm
ultimately resolves the dispute by awarding Buyer $300 of the $500 contested, then the costs and
expenses of the Accounting Firm will be allocated 60% (i.e., 300/500) to Seller and 40% (i.e.,
200/500) to Buyer.

including projected statements of operating revenues and income from operations of the Company and
its Subsidiaries and certain business plan information. Buyer acknowledges that there are
uncertainties inherent in attempting to make such estimates, projections and other forecasts and
plans, that Buyer is familiar with such uncertainties and that Buyer is taking full responsibility
for making its own evaluation of the adequacy and accuracy of all estimates, projections and other
forecasts and plans so furnished to it, including the reasonableness of the assumptions underlying
such estimates, projections and forecasts. Accordingly, Buyer hereby acknowledges that none of
Seller or the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is making any representation or warranty with
respect to such estimates, projections and other forecasts and plans, including the reasonableness
of the assumptions underlying such estimates, projections and forecasts. Buyer further agrees that
neither Seller, the Company, any of its Subsidiaries nor any other Person will have or be subject

hold them harmless from and against (i)&nbsp;any and all Taxes of the Company and its Subsidiaries for
all taxable periods ending on or before the Closing Date and the portion through the end of the
Closing Date for any taxable period that includes (but does not end on) the Closing Date (a

consolidated, combined, or unitary group of which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is or was
a member on or prior to the Closing Date, including pursuant to Treas. Reg. &#167;1.1502-6 or any
analogous or similar state, local, or non-US law or regulation, (iii)&nbsp;any and all Taxes of any
Person (other than the Company and its Subsidiaries) imposed on the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries as a transferee or successor, by contract or pursuant to any law, rule or regulation,
which Taxes relate to an event or transaction occurring before the Closing, (iv)&nbsp;any and all
Mexican Taxes imposed on the distribution of cash from FCI Mexico to FCI Americas International
Holdings LLC pursuant to the Mexican Intercompany Note Transaction, but only up to the amount of
Mexican Taxes that would be imposed if such distribution occurred immediately after the Closing
Date and (v)&nbsp;without duplication, any and all Canadian withholding Taxes (including any interest or
penalties) related to the FCI Intercompany Note, including the transaction described in <U>Section
10.01(h)(ii)</U> (which Taxes shall not include any Canadian withholding taxes imposed on the
distribution after the Closing Date of the Canadian Intercompany Note Cash to the Company or any of
its Affiliates), and in the case of Taxes described in (i), (ii), (iii), (iv)&nbsp;and (v), all other
Losses attributable thereto; <U>provided</U>, <U>however</U>, that in the case of Taxes described
in (i), (ii), (iii), (iv)&nbsp;and (v)&nbsp;above (x)&nbsp;Seller shall have no obligation to indemnify the
Company and its Subsidiaries unless such claim relates to an actual cash Tax payment made by the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries or Affiliates after the Closing Date, or that would have been so
made but for the carryback of a net operating loss or the utilization of a Tax asset that was
economically generated after the Closing Date and (y)&nbsp;the amount of such Taxes shall be determined
after taking into account the utilization of any available net operating losses and similar tax
attributes arising during any Pre-Closing Tax Period to the extent not previously utilized by the
Company or its Subsidiaries prior to the settlement of the tax contest, audit, or other similar
adjustment giving rise to the indemnification hereunder. For the avoidance of doubt, if the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries or Affiliates utilize net operating losses or similar tax
attributes to reduce a Tax described in (i), (ii), (iii), (iv)&nbsp;or (v)&nbsp;above and as a result a
representation of the Seller contained in <U>Section&nbsp;4.08</U> is breached, the Company and its
Subsidiaries shall be indemnified and held harmless from the Loss suffered or incurred or arising
from such breach pursuant to <U>Section&nbsp;8.02</U>. For the further avoidance of doubt, any US
federal taxable income realized by the Company and its Subsidiaries under Code
Section&nbsp;951 that results from, or to the extent is increased by, any action taken by the
Buyer, the Company, or their respective Affiliates after the Closing shall be considered to occur
in a taxable period that begins after the Closing Date for purposes of this <U>Section

Tax Period shall be determined based on an interim closing of the books as of the close of business

any of its Subsidiaries any Tax Benefit, then any payment by Seller to the Company or its

to Seller the amount of such Tax Benefit up to the amount of the indemnity payment when, as and if
realized.
