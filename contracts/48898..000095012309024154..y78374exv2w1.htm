Buyer, the Company or one of its Subsidiaries to fully respond to such
request beyond such sixty (60) day period. Seller and Buyer shall negotiate
in good faith to resolve the Disputed Items and all such discussions related
thereto shall (unless otherwise agreed by Buyer and Seller) be governed by
Rule 408 of the Federal Rules of Evidence and any applicable similar state
rule, but if they do not reach a final resolution within thirty (30) days
after the delivery of the Objections Statement to Buyer, Seller and Buyer
shall submit any unresolved Disputed Items to KPMG LLP (the " _Accounting
Firm_ "). In the event the parties submit any unresolved Disputed Items to
the Accounting Firm, each party shall submit a Closing Statement (which in
the case of each party may be a Closing Statement that, with respect to
the unresolved Disputed Items (but not, for the avoidance of doubt, with
respect to any other items), is different than the Closing Statement
initially submitted to Seller, or the Objections Statement delivered to
Buyer, as applicable) together with such supporting documentation as it
deems appropriate, to the Accounting Firm within thirty (30) days after the
date on which such unresolved Disputed Items were submitted to the Accounting
Firm for resolution. Seller and Buyer shall use their respective commercially
reasonable efforts to cause the Accounting Firm to resolve such dispute as
soon as practicable, but in any event within thirty (30) days after the date
on which the Accounting Firm receives the Closing Statements prepared by
Seller and Buyer. The Accounting Firm shall resolve such dispute by choosing
the Closing Statement proposed by either Seller or Buyer or amounts within
the range between the amounts set forth in the Closing Statement prepared by
Seller and the Closing Statement prepared by Buyer, and shall make no other
resolution of such dispute. Seller and Buyer shall use their respective
commercially reasonable efforts to cause the Accounting Firm to notify them
in writing of its resolution of such dispute as soon as practicable. The
Closing Statement selected by the Accounting Firm shall be final, binding and
non-appealable by the parties hereto. Each party shall bear its own costs and
expenses in connection with the resolution of such dispute by the Accounting
Firm. The Accounting Firm shall allocate its costs and expenses between Buyer
and Seller based upon a percentage for each party calculated to be what the
portion of the contested amount not awarded to such party bears to the amount
actually contested by such party. For example, if Buyer claims that Net
Working Capital is $1,000 less than the amount of Net Working Capital set
forth in the Closing Statement, and Seller contests only $500 of the amount
claimed by Buyer, and if the Accounting Firm ultimately resolves the dispute
by awarding Buyer $300 of the $500 contested, then the costs and expenses of
the Accounting Firm will be allocated 60% (i.e., 300/500) to Seller and 40%
(i.e., 200/500) to Buyer. 

   

 (e) If the Purchase Price as finally determined pursuant to _Section 2.02(d)_ (the " _Final Purchase Price_ ") is greater than the Estimated Purchase Price, then, within five (5) business days after the determination of Final Purchase Price, Buyer shall pay to Seller, by wire 

     ##### 

  

    

transfer of immediately available funds, an amount equal to such excess, plus
interest on such excess at the Applicable Rate from the Closing Date to the
date such payment is made pursuant to this _Section 2.02(e)_. 

   

 (f) If the Final Purchase Price is less than the Estimated Purchase Price, then, within five (5) business days after the determination of the Final Purchase Price, Seller shall pay to Buyer by, wire transfer of immediately available funds, an amount equal to such shortfall, plus interest on such shortfall at the Applicable Rate from the Closing Date to the date such payment is made pursuant to this _Section 2.02(f)_. 

   

 (g) All payments required pursuant to _Section 2.02(e)_ and _Section 2.02(f)_ shall be deemed to be adjustments to the Purchase Price for United States federal, state and local Income Tax purposes, unless otherwise required by applicable Law or taxing authority interpretations thereof. 

   

 (h) For the avoidance of doubt, in determining the Net Working Capital and the preparation of the Closing Statement for the purposes of calculating the Estimated Purchase Price and Final Purchase Price, the policies, methodologies and principles shall be the same as those used in calculating the Net Working Capital Target. The parties agree that the purpose of preparing and calculating the Net Working Capital hereunder is to measure changes in Net Working Capital without the introduction of new or different accounting methods, policies, practices, procedures, classifications, judgments or estimation methodologies from the Agreed Accounting Principles. 

   

 2.03 _The Closing_. The closing of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (the " _Closing_ ") shall take place at the offices of Kirkland and Ellis LLP, located at 300 North LaSalle Street, Chicago, Illinois, on or prior to the third (3rd) business day following the satisfaction or waiver of the conditions set forth in _Article III_ (other than those conditions that by their terms cannot be satisfied until the Closing), or on such other date and time as Buyer, Seller and Company shall mutually agree; _provided_ , that the Closing (x) shall not occur prior to October 1, 2009 and (y) may be delayed in connection with the items set forth on _Schedule 2.03_.

promptly notify Buyer in writing of the request or requirement so that Buyer

 (c) Commencing effective as of the Closing Date, Buyer shall provide employees of the Business for a period of at least one (1) year after the Closing Date with benefits and compensation that (in aggregate) are substantially equivalent to the benefits and compensation provided to the employees of the Business immediately prior to the Closing (excluding from such comparison any equity or equity-based compensation, benefits under qualified defined benefit pension plans and universal life, critical illness, accident insurance, legal club, identity theft and long term care benefits); _provided_ , _however_ , that the compensation and benefits provided to employees of the Business who are members of a collective bargaining unit shall satisfy the requirements of the applicable collective bargaining agreement. 

   

 (d) Buyer shall use commercially reasonable efforts (which shall include the effecting of all necessary plan amendments) to cause each employee of the Business (and their eligible dependents and beneficiaries, as applicable) to receive service credit for all purposes (other than benefit accrual under any qualified defined benefit pension and non-qualified retirement plans other than the FCI USA, Inc. Benefit Restoration Plan, f/k/a Framatome Connectors USA Inc. Benefit Restoration Plan) under any benefit or compensation plans, programs, agreements or arrangements in which such employee participates following the Closing Date for the service credited on behalf of such employee under the analogous Business Benefit Plan or Retained Benefit Plan in which such employee participated immediately prior to the Closing Date; _provided_ , _however_ , that in no event shall such service credit result in the duplication of benefits. For purposes of any plan providing medical, dental, disability, pharmaceutical and/or vision benefits to any employee of the Business following the Closing, Buyer shall use commercially reasonable efforts (which shall include the effecting of all necessary plan amendments) to cause all pre-existing condition exclusions and actively-at-work requirements of such plans to be waived for each employee of the Business and his or her covered dependents and to give full credit for all co-payments and deductibles satisfied immediately prior to the Closing Date, to the same extent such exclusions and requirements were waived or satisfied and such credit was given under the analogous Business Benefit Plan or Retained Benefit Plan in which such employee participated immediately prior to the Closing Date. 

   

 (e) During the one (1) year period following the Closing, Buyer shall take all actions required so that to the extent employees of the Business are terminated by Buyer, the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or any of their respective Affiliates following the Closing, each such employee who is eligible under the applicable severance policy in effect immediately prior to the Closing Date (as set forth on _Schedule 7.04(e)_) shall receive severance pay that is no less than the severance pay that would have been payable thereunder had such termination of employment occurred immediately prior to the Closing Date, using the actual date of termination of employment to compute the amount of severance payable (if any) to the applicable terminated employee. 

     ##### 

  

     

 (f) Following the Closing Date, Buyer shall (i) take all actions as are necessary or appropriate to ensure that each employee of the Business who receives a distribution from the FCI USA, Inc. Employee 401(k) Savings Plan (the " _FCI 401(k) Plan_ ") may elect to roll over his or her account balance (in cash, but including loan promissory notes) to a qualified 401(k) plan that shall be designated by Buyer to accept such roll-overs (the " _Buyer 401(k) Plan_ ") and (ii) make a contribution to the Buyer 401(k) Plan on behalf of the employees of the Business of the amount of the discretionary employer contribution that would have been made by FCI USA, Inc. or any of its Affiliates to the FCI 401(k) Plan on behalf of such employees for the plan year in which the Closing Date occurs (which discretionary employer contribution the Parties hereto agree shall not exceed one percent (1.0%) of such employees applicable compensation for such plan year), prorated for the portion of the plan year ending on the Closing Date, to the extent such amount is accrued as a liability in Net Working Capital. 

   

 (g) Effective as of the Closing Date, Buyer shall establish a retiree health and life insurance benefit plan for all current and former employees of the Business (and all eligible dependents and beneficiaries thereof) who immediately prior to the Closing Date are participants in or beneficiaries under the FCI USA, Inc. Retiree Benefits Plan (collectively, the " _Retirees_ ") which shall contain participation, eligibility, benefit determination and benefit payment provisions that are substantially the same as those currently applicable to the Retirees under the FCI USA, Inc. Retiree Benefits Plan, and Buyer shall assume and discharge all obligations and liabilities of FCI USA, Inc. (and any predecessors or successors thereof) for the provision of postretirement welfare benefits to the Retirees. Without limiting the generality of  _Section 7.04(d)_, Buyers postretirement welfare benefit plan shall credit all service with FCI USA, Inc. and any of its Affiliates for all purposes under Buyers postretirement welfare benefit plan and to the same extent such service was credited under the FCI USA, Inc. Retiree Benefits Plan immediately prior to the Closing Date; _provided_ , _however_ , that in no event shall such service credit result in the duplication of benefits. 

   

 (h) Buyer shall be solely responsible for complying with the requirements of COBRA for any current or former employee of the Business (or any eligible dependent or beneficiary thereof) who is an "MandA qualified beneficiary" as defined in QandA-4 of Treas. Reg. §54.4980B-9 effective as of the Closing Date (excluding any such employee who becomes an "MandA qualified beneficiary" solely as a result of the Reorganization Transactions). 

   

 (i) Effective as of the Closing Date, Buyer shall assume the sponsorship of the FCI USA, Inc. Benefit Restoration Plan, f/k/a Framatome Connectors USA Inc. Benefit Restoration Plan and the Trust under the Framatome Connectors USA Inc. Benefit Restoration Plan(s), including the assets held in such trust, and shall assume and discharge all liabilities and obligations of FCI USA, Inc. and its Affiliates for the benefits of the individuals listed on _Schedule 7.04(i)_ under the FCI USA, Inc. Benefit Restoration Plan, f/k/a the Framatome Connectors USA Inc. Benefit Restoration Plan, and notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement or any provision of the applicable plan document, Buyer shall not modify or terminate (or permit to be modified or terminated) such benefits prior to the payment in full thereof. 

    ##### 

  

     

 (j) Effective as of the Closing Date, Buyer shall assume the sponsorship of all Foreign Business Benefit Plans sponsored, maintained or contributed to by FCI Canada Inc. (" _FCI Canada Plans_ "). Pursuant to the Reorganization Plan, on or before Closing all active employees of FCI Canada Inc. who are not employed in the Business (" _Canadian Non-Business Employees_ ") will be transferred out of FCI Canada Inc. Effective as of the Closing, Canadian Non-Business Employees (and any eligible beneficiaries thereof) who are participants in any Foreign Business Benefit Plan of FCI Canada Inc. shall be treated as terminated from participation under such Foreign Business Benefit Plan and no Canadian Non-Business Employee (or any dependent or beneficiary thereof) shall earn or accrue any additional service, benefits or compensation under any Foreign Business Benefit Plan on or after the Closing Date. Effective as of the Closing, the retired former Quebec employees of FCI Canada Inc. (and any dependents or beneficiaries thereof) who are entitled to non-pension benefits under a Foreign Business Benefit Plan of FCI Canada Inc. shall be treated as terminated from participation under such Foreign Business Benefit Plan and Seller shall cause them to be provided any non-pension benefits to which they are entitled following the Closing under a new plan established by Seller or any of its Subsidiaries. Seller shall assume or retain, and Buyer shall not assume or have any responsibility for, any liabilities or other obligations relating to the retired former Quebec employees of FCI Canada Inc. (or any dependents or beneficiaries thereof) (including, without limitation, with respect to such non-pension benefits). The terms of employment of Canadian Non-Business Employees after Closing, including any retirement and other employment benefits, shall be determined by Seller (subject to collective bargaining in respect of any unionized Canadian Non-Business Employees) and such benefits may or may not include participation in a registered pension plan. Following the Closing Date, if requested by Seller and subject to regulatory approval, Buyer shall cause FCI Canada Inc. to promptly transfer assets related to defined contribution entitlements of the Canadian Non-Business Employees held in trust for FCI Canada Inc.s registered pension plans to one or more registered pension plans established by a Subsidiary of Seller for the benefit of the Canadian Non-Business Employees. From and after the Closing, Buyer shall cause FCI Canada Inc. to complete the partial wind ups of registered pension plans of FCI Canada Inc. declared prior to Closing, subject to regulatory requirements and any required third party approvals.

Within sixty (60) days after Buyers receipt of substantially all such documents and other items set forth on _Schedule 7.04(k)_ , Buyer shall effectuate the provisions of _Sections 7.04(b) through (i)_. Seller and Buyer shall each cooperate with the other as reasonably necessary to effect the provisions of this _Section 7.04_. 

   

 (l) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, Seller and Buyer acknowledge and agree that all provisions contained in this _Section 7.04_ are included for the sole benefit of Seller and Buyer, and that nothing in this Agreement, whether express or implied, (i) shall be treated as an amendment or other modification of any Business Benefit Plan, (ii) shall, except as necessary to comply with _Section 7.04(i)_, limit the right of Buyer or Seller or any of their respective Affiliates to amend, terminate or otherwise modify any Business Benefit Plan (it being agreed and understood that Buyer shall only be permitted to amend, terminate or otherwise modify the FCI USA, Inc. Retiree Benefits Plan to the extent permitted thereunder or under applicable Law), Retained Benefit Plan or other benefit plan, agreement or other arrangement 

    ##### 

  

    

maintained by any of them following the Closing, or (iii) shall create any
third party beneficiary or other right (x) in any other Person, including,
without limitation, any current or former employee of the Business or any
participant in any Business Benefit Plan or other applicable benefit plan,
agreement or other arrangement (or any dependent or beneficiary thereof), or
(y) to continued employment with Seller, Buyer or any of their respective
Affiliates. 

   

 (m) As soon as reasonably practicable after the date hereof, Seller shall use commercially reasonable efforts to provide Buyer the documents and other items set forth on _Schedule 7.04(m)_. 

   

 7.05 _Regulatory Filings_. 

   

 (a) Buyer shall, as soon as reasonably practicable after the date hereof, make or cause to be made all filings and submissions under any laws or regulations applicable to this transaction, including any filing necessary under any applicable Competition Laws. Subject to applicable laws relating to the exchange of information, Seller shall have the right to review in advance, and to the extent practicable will consult with Buyer on, all the information that appears in any such filings. In exercising the foregoing right, Seller shall act reasonably and as promptly as practicable. 

   

 (b) Buyer agrees to use its reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions necessary to expeditiously consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including using its reasonable best efforts to respond to government requests for information and to obtain all necessary governmental, judicial or regulatory actions or non-actions, orders, waivers, consents, clearances, extensions and approvals. In furtherance of the foregoing, Buyer shall consent to all divestitures or licenses of assets, supply or exchange agreements, hold separate agreements, and any and all such other actions as may be required to obtain any and all necessary governmental, judicial or regulatory actions or non-actions, orders, waivers, consents, clearances, extensions and approvals. In furtherance of the foregoing, if a suit or other action is threatened or instituted by any Governmental Body or any other entity challenging the validity or legality or seeking to restrain the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, Buyer shall use its reasonable best efforts to avoid, resist, resolve and, if necessary, defend such suit or action. 

   

 (c) Buyer shall keep Seller apprised of the status of all filings and submissions referred to in _Section 7.05(a)_ above, including promptly furnishing Seller with copies of notices or other communications received by Buyer in connection therewith. Buyer shall not permit any of its officers, employees or other representatives or agents to participate in any meeting with any Governmental Body in respect of such filings and submissions unless it consults Seller in advance and, to the extent permitted by such Governmental Body, gives Seller the opportunity to attend and participate at such meeting. 

   

 7.06 _Conditions_. Buyer shall use commercially reasonable efforts to cause the conditions set forth in  _Sections 3.01_ and _3.03_ to be satisfied and to consummate the transactions contemplated herein as soon as reasonably possible after the satisfaction of the conditions set forth in _Article III_ (other than those to be satisfied at the Closing). 

     ##### 

  

     

 7.07 _Contact with Customers, Suppliers and Other Business Relations_. Prior to the Closing, Buyer and Buyers Representatives shall contact and communicate with the employees, customers, suppliers and other business relations of the Company and its Subsidiaries in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby only with the prior written consent of the Company and Seller (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed). 

   

 7.08 _Guarantee_. Guarantor hereby irrevocably, absolutely, and unconditionally guarantees to each of Seller and to the Company the prompt and complete payment and performance when and as due of all obligations, including payment obligations, of Buyer under this Agreement. In furtherance of the foregoing, Guarantor acknowledges and agrees that either of Seller or the Company may, in its sole discretion, bring and prosecute a separate action or actions against Guarantor to enforce its obligations under this _Section 7.08_, regardless of whether action is brought against Buyer or any other Person, whether Buyer or any other Person is joined in any such action or actions or whether Buyer or any other Person is primarily responsible for causing the obligations, including payment obligations, of Buyer under this Agreement to be fulfilled. 

   

 7.09 _Facility Closings; Employee Layoffs_. On and after the Closing, Buyer shall cause the Company and its Subsidiaries to comply with any and all applicable notice or filing requirements under WARN, and shall indemnify and hold Seller harmless from all Liabilities arising under WARN resulting in whole or in part from the actions or omissions of Buyer occurring on or after the Closing Date. Prior to the Closing, Seller shall cause the Company and its Subsidiaries to comply with any and all applicable notice or filing requirements under WARN. Seller shall indemnify and hold Buyer harmless from all Liabilities arising under WARN resulting solely from the actions or omissions of Seller occurring prior to the Closing Date. 

   

 7.10 _Seller Marks_. Except as set forth below or as specifically contemplated by the Transition Services Agreement, Buyer shall obtain no right, title, interest, license or any other right whatsoever to use the name "FCI" or any trademarks or logos containing or comprising the foregoing in whole or in part (collectively, the " _Seller Marks_ "). As soon as practicable following the Closing, but no later than twelve (12) months following the Closing Date, Buyer agrees that it shall remove and change signage, change and substitute promotional or advertising material in whatever medium, change stationery and packaging, and take all such other steps as may be required or appropriate to cease use of the Seller Marks; _provided_ , _however_ , that Buyer shall not be deemed to have violated this _Section 7.10_ by reason of (i) its use after the Closing of any inventory existing as of the Closing Date, (ii) the appearance of the Seller Marks that are permanently marked in or on any tools, dies, molding, equipment, engineering/manufacturing drawings, manuals, work sheets, operating procedures, other written materials or other assets that are used in connection with the Business; _provided_ _that_ Buyer endeavors to remove such appearances of the Seller Marks in the ordinary course of business and shall remove such appearances no later than three (3) years following the Closing, or (iii) the appearance of the Seller Marks in or on any third partys publications, marketing materials, brochures, instruction sheets, equipment or products that were distributed prior to the Closing Date, and that generally are in the public domain, or any other similar uses by any such third party over which Buyer has no control, or (iv) the use by Buyer of the Seller Marks in a non-trademark manner for purposes of conveying to customers or the general public that the name of the Business has changed or the 

    ##### 

  

    

change in ownership or historical origins of the Business. The parties agree,
because damages could be an inadequate remedy, that Seller shall be entitled
to seek specific performance and injunctive relief as remedies for any breach
of this _Section 7.10_ in addition to other remedies available at law or in
equity. 

   

 7.11 _Insurance_. 

   

 (a) Except as specifically provided in _Section 7.11(b)_ below, Buyer acknowledges that, as of the Closing Date, all of Sellers insurance policies will no longer be available to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries and Affiliates. 

   

 (b) In the case of any insurance policy of Seller or its Affiliates (other than the Company or its Subsidiaries) for which a valid claim is permitted to be made after the Closing by the Company, Seller shall, and shall cause its Affiliates to, use their reasonable efforts to assist Buyer in asserting claims for any loss, liability or damage suffered with respect to the Company and its Subsidiaries after the Closing with respect to any incident or event occurring prior to the Closing, to the extent such loss, liability or damage is covered by the terms of such insurance policy; _provided_ , _however_ , _that_ (i) all of Sellers and its Affiliates reasonable out-of-pocket costs and expenses incurred in connection with the foregoing are promptly paid by Buyer or its Subsidiaries as directed by Seller, (ii) such claims will be subject to (and recovery thereon will be reduced by the amount of) any applicable deductibles, retentions, gaps or self-insurance provisions, (iii) such claims will be subject to exhaustion of per claim and applicable limits and (iv) in the event that any legal action, arbitration, negotiation or other proceedings are required for coverage to be asserted against any insurer or a claim to be perfected, Buyer may do so solely at its own expense. For the avoidance of doubt, in no event shall Buyer be entitled to assert any claim with respect to an occurrence with a date of loss occurring after the Closing Date. None of Seller or its Affiliates will bear any liability for the failure of an insurance carrier to pay any claim under any such insurance policy. 

   

 (c) Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement, Seller shall not be required to comply with this or any portion thereof if so doing would be adverse to Seller or any of its Subsidiaries or require any of Seller or any of its Subsidiaries to incur any significant costs not reimbursable by Buyer. 

   

 7.12 _Non-Solicitation_. Buyer agrees that, for a period of three (3) years from the Closing Date, it, and its Affiliates, shall not directly or indirectly induce or attempt to induce any of those individuals set forth on _Exhibit G_ to leave the employ of Seller or its Subsidiaries; provided, however, that generalized advertisement of employment opportunities, including in trade or industry publications, and generalized employee searches that do not specifically target Seller or its Subsidiaries shall not be deemed to cause a breach of this _Section 7.12_. 

   

 7.13 _Ruland Employment Agreement_. Buyer will negotiate in good faith with Rodd Ruland to finalize an employment agreement, to be executed as of the Closing, consistent with the terms set forth on _Schedule 7.13_. 

     ##### 

  

     

 7.14 _Environmental Information_. 

   

 (a) During the period after Closing while Seller has an outstanding indemnity obligation or covenant for the benefit of the Buyer that relates to Environmental Laws or Hazardous Substances, Buyer shall, at Sellers reasonable request, provide to Seller copies of non-privileged environmental reports (i) describing conditions or matters at or relating to the Real Property or the Company that could reasonably be expected to give rise to any such indemnity obligation or covenant and (ii) that are in the possession, custody or control of the Company or Buyer. 

   

 (b) During the period after Closing and until the earlier of (i) the time Sellers indemnity obligations under _Section 8.02(a)(vii)_ have expired or (ii) Seller has assigned its indemnification obligations under _Section 8.02(a)(vii)_ pursuant to the provisions of  _Section 11.04_ if, following such assignment, Seller (or any Affiliate thereof) has no further economic exposure pursuant to the indemnification obligations under _Section 8.02(a)(vii)_ , Buyer shall, at Sellers reasonable request and at Sellers sole cost and expense, provide Seller with split samples from existing groundwater monitoring wells located at 185 Grassy Plain Street, Bethel, CT. The sampling shall be performed by an accredited environmental consultant of Buyers choosing. Seller, or its designated representative, may observe the sampling. At Buyers request, Seller will provide Buyer a copy of any laboratory analysis or reports on the samples provided pursuant to this _Section 7.14_. 

   

 (c) All information provided to Buyer pursuant to this _Section 7.14_, including any samples or reports of laboratory analysis thereof, shall be maintained as Confidential Information pursuant to _Section 6.08_.

Following the Closing, except to the extent that remedies have been judicially determined (and non-appealable) to have arisen from intentional fraud committed by any Person, the indemnification provided by _Section 8.02(a)_, _Section 8.03(a)_ and _Section 10.01_ shall be the sole and exclusive remedy with respect to any and all claims for money damages relating to the subject matter of this Agreement and the transaction contemplated hereby (except for disputes under _Section 2.02_, which disputes will be resolved in accordance with the dispute mechanism set forth in _Section 2.02_). 

     ##### 

  

     

 8.05 _Materiality_. For purposes of indemnification under this _Article VIII_ relating to a breach of a representation or warranty by Seller and/or Buyer, the representations and warranties of Seller and/or Buyer set forth in this Agreement that are qualified as to materiality, Material Adverse Effect, material adverse effect or any other similar materiality qualification (other than with respect to _Section 4.05(b)_, the last sentence of _Section 4.05(c)_ and the first sentence of _Section 4.06_) shall be deemed not to include any such qualification, and Seller and/or Buyer shall be liable for Losses in connection with any breach of a representation or warranty as if such qualification did not exist, except to the extent the word "material" or similar qualification is used solely as part of a defining list of items as opposed to qualifying a statement. 

   

 8.06 _Mitigation_. Each Person entitled to indemnification hereunder shall take commercially reasonable steps to mitigate all Losses after becoming aware of any event which would reasonably be expected to give rise to any Losses that are indemnifiable or recoverable hereunder or in connection herewith. In furtherance of the foregoing, (i) Buyer shall not knowingly and intentionally instigate or encourage any claim under _Section 8.02(a)(vii)_ by a Person who is not a Buyer Indemnitees and (ii) Buyer shall not be entitled to recovery for any action relating (directly or indirectly) to this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby if the Losses relating to such action are actually recovered by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries after the Closing pursuant to any agreement(s) entered into by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries in connection with past acquisitions or sales. 

   

 8.07 _Inter-Party Claims_. In order for a party to be entitled to seek any indemnification provided for under this Agreement, other than with respect to a claim relating to Taxes (including a claim for breach of a representation contained in _Section 4.08_) which shall be governed by the notice provisions of _Section 10.01(g)_, (such party the " _Claiming Party_ "), such Claiming Party must notify the other party or parties from whom such indemnification is sought (the " _Defending Party_ ") in writing as promptly as reasonably practicable after receiving actual knowledge of the occurrence of the event giving rise to such Claiming Partys claim for indemnification, specifying in reasonable detail the basis of such claim; _provided_ , _however_ ,  _that_ failure to give such notification shall not affect the indemnification provided hereunder except to the extent the Defending Party shall have been actually and materially prejudiced as a result of such failure and the indemnification obligations are materially increased as a result of such failure. If the Defending Party disputes its liability with respect to any such claim, the Defending Party and the Claiming Party shall proceed to negotiate a resolution of such dispute and, if not resolved through negotiations, such dispute shall, subject to the terms of this Agreement, be resolved by litigation in an appropriate court of competent jurisdiction. 

   

 8.08 _Defense of Third Party Claims_. 

   

 (a) In order for a party (the " _Indemnified Party_ ") to be entitled to any indemnification provided for under this Agreement, other than with respect to a claim relating to Taxes (including a claim for breach of a representation contained in _Section 4.08_) which shall be governed by the notice provisions of _Section 10.01(g)_, in respect of a claim or demand made by any Person against the Indemnified Party (such claim, excluding any claim relating to Taxes, a " _Third-Party Claim_ "), such Indemnified Party must notify the indemnifying party (the " _Indemnifying Party_ ") in writing, and in reasonable detail, of the Third-Party Claim as promptly 

    ##### 

  

    

as reasonably possible after receipt by such Indemnified Party of notice of
the Third-Party Claim; _provided_ , _however_ , _that_ failure to give
such notification on a timely basis shall not affect the indemnification
provided hereunder except to the extent the Indemnifying Party shall have
been actually prejudiced as a result of such failure. Thereafter, the
Indemnified Party shall deliver to the Indemnifying Party, within five (5)
business days after the Indemnified Partys receipt thereof, copies of all
notices and documents (including court papers) received by the Indemnified
Party relating to the Third-Party Claim. 

   

 (b) If a Third-Party Claim is made against an Indemnified Party, the Indemnifying Party shall be entitled to participate in the defense thereof and, if it so chooses, to assume the defense thereof with counsel selected by the Indemnifying Party and reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnified Party. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Seller shall continue to be entitled to assert any limitation on any claims contained in this _Article VIII_. Should an Indemnifying Party so elect to assume the defense of a Third-Party Claim, the Indemnifying Party shall not be liable to the Indemnified Party for legal expenses subsequently incurred by the Indemnified Party in connection with the defense thereof. If the Indemnifying Party assumes such defense, the Indemnified Party shall have the right to participate in the defense thereof and to employ counsel, at its own expense, separate from the counsel employed by the Indemnifying Party, it being understood, however, that the Indemnifying Party shall control such defense. The Indemnifying Party shall be liable for the fees and expenses of counsel employed by the Indemnified Party for any period during which the Indemnifying Party has not assumed the defense thereof. If the Indemnifying Party chooses to defend any Third-Party Claim, all the parties hereto shall cooperate in the defense or prosecution of such Third-Party Claim. Such cooperation shall include the retention and (upon the Indemnifying Partys request) the provision to the Indemnifying Party of records and information which are reasonably relevant to such Third-Party Claim, and making employees and other representatives and advisors available on a mutually convenient basis to provide additional information and explanation of any material provided hereunder. Whether or not the Defending Party shall have assumed the defense of a Third Party Claim, neither the Defending Party nor the Claiming Party shall admit any liability with respect to, or settle, compromise or discharge, any Third Party Claim without the prior written consent of the other party, which shall not be unreasonably withheld. The Defending Party shall not enter into any settlement of, or consent to the entry judgment in connection with, any Third Party Claim that does not include the complete release of the Claiming Party from all liability will respect thereto. 

   

 8.09 _Determination of Loss Amount_. The amount of any Loss subject to indemnification under _Section 8.02_ or _Section 8.03_ shall be calculated net of (a) any Tax Benefit that an Indemnified Party actually recognizes in the year of the indemnity payment or earlier on account of such Loss and (b) any insurance proceeds (net of direct collection expenses) or any indemnity, contribution or other similar payment actually received by the Indemnified Party from any third party with respect thereto; _provided_ , that for a period of three (3) years after the incurrence of the relevant Loss, to the extent such Loss gives rise to a Tax Benefit that is realized by the Indemnified Party after the year of the indemnity payment, then the Indemnified Party shall refund to the Indemnifying Party the amount of such Tax Benefit up to the amount of the indemnity payment when, as and if realized. The Indemnified Party shall seek full recovery under all insurance policies covering any Loss to the same extent as they would if such Loss were not subject to indemnification hereunder. In the event that an insurance or other recovery is 

    ##### 

  

    

made by any Indemnified Party with respect to any Loss for which any such
Person has been indemnified hereunder, then a refund equal to the aggregate
amount of the recovery (less any costs or expenses to obtain such recovery)
shall be made promptly to the Indemnifying Party. The Indemnifying Party
shall be subrogated to all rights of the Indemnified Parties and their
Affiliates in respect of any Losses indemnified by Indemnifying Party.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement,
Buyer shall have no right to indemnification hereunder with respect to any
Loss or alleged Loss to the extent the amount of such Loss or alleged Loss is
included in the calculation of the Net Working Capital or Indebtedness. 

   

 8.10 _Payments_. Payment of any indemnification obligation pursuant to this _Article VIII_ shall be effected by wire transfer of immediately available funds to an account(s) designated by the Indemnified Party within thirty (30) days after the determination thereof. 

   

 8.11 _Acknowledgment of Buyer_. Buyer acknowledges that it has conducted to its satisfaction, an independent investigation and verification of the financial condition, results of operations, assets, liabilities, properties and projected operations of the Company and its Subsidiaries, and, in making its determination to proceed with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, Buyer has relied solely on the results of its own independent investigation and verification and the representations and warranties of Seller expressly and specifically set forth in this Agreement. In connection with Buyers investigation of the Company and its Subsidiaries, Buyer has received certain projections, including projected statements of operating revenues and income from operations of the Company and its Subsidiaries and certain business plan information. Buyer acknowledges that there are uncertainties inherent in attempting to make such estimates, projections and other forecasts and plans, that Buyer is familiar with such uncertainties and that Buyer is taking full responsibility for making its own evaluation of the adequacy and accuracy of all estimates, projections and other forecasts and plans so furnished to it, including the reasonableness of the assumptions underlying such estimates, projections and forecasts. Accordingly, Buyer hereby acknowledges that none of Seller or the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is making any representation or warranty with respect to such estimates, projections and other forecasts and plans, including the reasonableness of the assumptions underlying such estimates, projections and forecasts. Buyer further agrees that neither Seller, the Company, any of its Subsidiaries nor any other Person will have or be subject to any liability to Buyer or any other Person resulting from the distribution to Buyer, or Buyers use of, any such information, including the Confidential Information Memorandum prepared by Seller (the " _Information Memorandum_ ") and any information, document or material made available to Buyer or its Affiliates in certain "data rooms," management presentations or any other form in expectation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. 

   

 8.12 _Characterization of Indemnification Payments_. The parties agree to treat all payments made pursuant to this _Article VIII_ and  _Section 10.01_ as adjustments to the Purchase Price for United States federal, state and local income Tax purposes, unless otherwise required by applicable Law or taxing authority interpretations thereof.

ARTICLE X 

   

ADDITIONAL COVENANTS  

  

 10.01 _Tax Matters_. 

   

 (a) _Tax Indemnification by Seller_. Seller shall indemnify the Buyer Indemnitees and hold them harmless from and against (i) any and all Taxes of the Company and its Subsidiaries for all taxable periods ending on or before the Closing Date and the portion through the end of the Closing Date for any taxable period that includes (but does not end on) the Closing Date (a " _Pre-Closing Tax Period_ "), (ii) any and all Taxes of any member of an affiliated, consolidated, combined, or unitary group of which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is or was a member on or prior to the Closing Date, including pursuant to Treas. Reg. §1.1502-6 or any analogous or similar state, local, or non-US law or regulation, (iii) any and all Taxes of any Person (other than the Company and its Subsidiaries) imposed on the Company or any of its Subsidiaries as a transferee or successor, by contract or pursuant to any law, rule or regulation, which Taxes relate to an event or transaction occurring before the Closing, (iv) any and all Mexican Taxes imposed on the distribution of cash from FCI Mexico to FCI Americas International Holdings LLC pursuant to the Mexican Intercompany Note Transaction, but only up to the amount of Mexican Taxes that would be imposed if such distribution occurred immediately after the Closing Date and (v) without duplication, any and all Canadian withholding Taxes (including any interest or penalties) related to the FCI Intercompany Note, including the transaction described in _Section 10.01(h)(ii)_ (which Taxes shall not include any Canadian withholding taxes imposed on the distribution after the Closing Date of the Canadian Intercompany Note Cash to the Company or any of its Affiliates), and in the case of Taxes described in (i), (ii), (iii), (iv) and (v), all other Losses attributable thereto; _provided_ , _however_ , that in the case of Taxes described in (i), (ii), (iii), (iv) and (v) above (x) Seller shall have no obligation to indemnify the Company and its Subsidiaries unless such claim relates to an actual cash Tax payment made by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or Affiliates after the Closing Date, or that would have been so made but for the carryback of a net operating loss or the utilization of a Tax asset that was economically generated after the Closing Date and (y) the amount of such Taxes shall be determined after taking into account the utilization of any available net operating losses and similar tax attributes arising during any Pre-Closing Tax Period to the extent not previously utilized by the Company or its Subsidiaries prior to the settlement of the tax contest, audit, or other similar adjustment giving rise to the indemnification hereunder. For the avoidance of doubt, if the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or Affiliates utilize net operating losses or similar tax attributes to reduce a Tax described in (i), (ii), (iii), (iv) or (v) above and as a result a representation of the Seller contained in _Section 4.08_ is breached, the Company and its Subsidiaries shall be indemnified and held harmless from the Loss suffered or incurred or arising from such breach pursuant to _Section 8.02_. For the further avoidance of doubt, any US federal taxable income realized by the Company and its Subsidiaries under Code Section 951 that results from, or to the extent is increased by, any action taken by the Buyer, the Company, or their respective Affiliates after the Closing shall be considered to occur in a taxable period that begins after the Closing Date for purposes of this _Section 10.01(a)_ and _Article VIII_. 

    ##### 

  

     

 (b) _Straddle Period_. In the case of any taxable period that includes (but does not end on) the Closing Date (a " _Straddle Period_ "), the amount of any Taxes for the Pre-Closing Tax Period shall be determined based on an interim closing of the books as of the close of business on the Closing Date (and for such purpose, the taxable period of any partnership or other pass-through entity in which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries holds a beneficial interest shall be deemed to terminate at such time); _provided_ , _however_ , _that_ with respect to Taxes (other than income, franchise/capital sales, use, or withholding Taxes) or exemptions, allowances or deductions that are calculated on an annual basis, and not on a closing of the books method, (including depreciation and amortization deductions) such Taxes, exemptions, allowances, or deductions shall be allocated between the period ending on and including the Closing Date and the period beginning after the Closing Date based on the number of days for the portion of the Straddle Period ending on and including the Closing Date, on the one hand, and the number of days for the portion of the Straddle Period beginning after the Closing Date, on the other hand. 

   

 (c) _Tax Benefits_. If Sellers indemnification obligation under _Section 10.01(a)_ arises in respect of a Tax adjustment which makes allowable to Buyer, the Company or any of its Subsidiaries any Tax Benefit, then any payment by Seller to the Company or its Subsidiaries shall be calculated net of any such Tax Benefit actually recognized by Buyer, the Company or its Subsidiaries in the year of the indemnity payment or earlier; _provided_   _that_ , for a period of three (3) years after the occurrence of the relevant adjustment to the extent such adjustment gives rise to a Tax Benefit that is realized by the Buyer, the Company or any of its Subsidiaries after the year of the indemnity payment, then the Company shall refund to Seller the amount of such Tax Benefit up to the amount of the indemnity payment when, as and if realized. 

   

 (d) _Responsibility for Filing Tax Returns_. 

    

 (i) Seller shall prepare and file or cause to be prepared and filed when due all Tax Returns that are required to be filed by or with respect to the Company and its Subsidiaries for taxable years or periods ending on or before the Closing Date (" _Pre-Closing Tax Returns_ ") and shall remit or cause to be timely remitted any Taxes due in respect of such Tax Returns. Buyer shall prepare and file or cause to be prepared and filed when due all Tax Returns that are required to be filed by or with respect to the Company and its Subsidiaries for taxable years or periods ending after the Closing Date and shall remit or cause to be remitted any Taxes due in respect of such Tax Returns. With respect to Pre-Closing Tax Returns, provided Seller complies with _Section 10.01(d)(ii)_, Buyer shall cooperate with Seller in filing such Tax Returns, including causing the Company and its Subsidiaries to sign and file such Tax Returns. With respect to Tax Returns of the Company and its Subsidiaries for Straddle Periods (" _Straddle Period Tax Returns_ "), Buyer shall prepare or cause to be prepared such Tax Returns in a manner consistent with Sellers past practice unless otherwise required by Law or change of fact. Seller shall pay to Buyer an amount equal to any Taxes for which Seller is liable pursuant to _Section 10.01(a)_ (but which are payable with Tax Returns to be filed by Buyer pursuant to the previous sentence) within three (3) days prior to the due date for the filing of such Tax Returns. 

   

 (ii) Subject to _Section 10.01(e)_, with respect to Pre-Closing Tax Returns and Straddle Period Tax Returns, the party preparing such Tax Return shall 

   ##### 

  

    

deliver a copy of such Tax Return to the other party for its review and
approval not less than fifteen (15) business days prior to the date on which
such Tax Returns are due to be filed (taking into account any applicable
extensions). If the parties disagree as to any item reflected on any such Tax
Return, they shall negotiate in good faith to resolve such disagreement. If
they cannot reach a final resolution by ten (10) days before the due date of
such Tax Return (taking into account any applicable extensions) the matter
shall be submitted to the Accounting Firm for resolution. The costs of the
Accounting Firm shall be borne equally fifty percent (50%) by Buyer and fifty
percent (50%) by Seller. 

  

 (e) _Transfer Taxes_.

Any Tax Returns that must be filed in connection with Transfer Taxes shall be prepared by the party primarily or customarily responsible under applicable local Law for filing such Tax Returns, and such party will provide such Tax Returns to the other party for such other partys review and approval at least ten (10) business days prior to the date such Tax Returns are due to be filed. Buyer and Seller shall cooperate in the timely completion and filing of all such Tax Returns. Each party shall promptly pay all Transfer Taxes for which it is responsible pursuant to this _Section 10.01(e)_. For the avoidance of doubt, all Transfer Taxes incurred as a result of the Reorganization Transactions shall be Retained Liabilities and shall be the responsibility of Seller. Seller shall promptly pay all such Taxes. Any Transfer Taxes resulting from any subsequent increase in the Purchase Price, as adjusted pursuant to the terms hereof, shall be borne in accordance with the provisions of this _Section 10.01(e)_. 

   

 (f) _Tax Refunds_. Any Tax refund (including any interest in respect thereof) received by Buyer, the Company, and its Subsidiaries, and any amounts credited against Tax to which Buyer, the Company, and its Subsidiaries becomes entitled (including by way of any amended Tax Returns) that (i) (A) relate to any taxable year or period that ends on or before the Closing Date and, with respect to any Straddle Period, the portion of such Straddle Period deemed to end on and include the Closing Date and (B) relate to Taxes paid by the Company or its Subsidiaries prior to the Closing Date or by Seller pursuant to _Section 10.01(a)_ or (ii) relate to Taxes paid by Seller pursuant to _Article VIII_, except in each case to the extent such refund or credit resulted from the carryback of a net operating loss or other Tax attribute that was economically generated after the Closing Date, shall be for the account of Seller, and Buyer shall pay to Seller any such refund or the amount of any such credit (net of any cost related thereto) within fifteen (15) days after receipt or entitlement thereto. Notwithstanding the foregoing, any refund of Transfer Taxes shall be split equally fifty percent (50%) by Buyer and fifty percent (50%) by Seller. 

   

 (g) _Contests_. 

    

 (i) After the Closing Date, Buyer and Seller shall each notify the other in writing within ten (10) days of the commencement of any audit or administrative or judicial proceeding affecting the Taxes or Tax attributes of the Company or any of its 

   ##### 

  

    

Subsidiaries;  _provided_ , _however_ , _that_ Buyer shall only have the
obligation to notify Seller if the audit or administrative or judicial
proceeding would, if determined adversely to the taxpayer, or after the lapse
of time, be grounds for indemnification under this _Section 10.01_ or under
_Article VIII_ with respect to Taxes by Seller. Such notice shall contain
factual information describing any asserted Tax liability and shall include
copies of any notice or other document received from any Tax Authority
in respect of any such asserted Tax liability. If either Buyer or Seller
fails to give the other party prompt notice of an asserted Tax liability as
required under this Agreement, the failure to give such notification shall
not affect the indemnification provided hereunder except to the extent the
other party shall have been actually prejudiced as a result of such failure
or the indemnification obligations are increased as a result of such
failure. 

   

 (ii) In the case of an audit or administrative or judicial proceeding involving any Taxes or Tax attributes relating to any taxable years or periods ending on or before the Closing Date or any Straddle Period of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, Seller shall have the right, at its expense, to control the conduct of such audit or proceeding;  _provided_ , _however_ , that Buyer may participate in the conduct of such audit or proceeding at its own expense and Seller shall not settle any such audit or proceeding without the consent of Buyer, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed. 

   

 (iii) In the case of an audit or administrative or judicial proceeding involving any Taxes or Tax attributes relating to any taxable years or periods beginning after the Closing Date of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, Buyer shall have the right, at its expense, to control the conduct of such audit or proceeding; _provided_ , _however_ , that if such audit or proceeding would be reasonably expected to result in a material increase in Tax liability of any of the Company or any or its Subsidiaries for which Seller would be liable under _Section 10.01(a)_ or under _Article VIII_, Seller may participate in the conduct of such audit or proceeding at its own expense and Buyer shall not settle any such audit or proceeding without the consent of Seller, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed; _provided,_ _further_ , that Sellers right to participation and consent shall be limited to matters or issues involving the Company and its Subsidiaries. 

  

 (h) _Assistance and Cooperation_. 

    

 (i) Each of Buyer and Seller shall provide the other with such assistance as may reasonably be requested (including access to the personnel and records of the Company and its Subsidiaries) by the other party in connection with the preparation of any Tax Return, any audit or other examination by any Tax authority, or any judicial or administrative proceedings relating to liability for Taxes with respect to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries and each shall retain and provide the requesting party with any records and copies of applicable Tax Returns, supporting work papers, source documentation or information which may be relevant to such return, audit or examination, proceedings or determination. Any information obtained pursuant to this  _Section 10.01(h)_ or pursuant to any other Section hereof providing for the sharing of information or review of any Tax Return or other schedule relating to Taxes with respect 

   #####

parties hereto except to the extent that a Party is legally compelled to
disclose such information. Additionally, for the avoidance of doubt, after
the Closing Date, Buyer shall cooperate fully and comply with Sellers
request for information with respect to Sellers right to receive the Tax
refunds pursuant to _Section 8.09_, _10.01(c)_ , or  _10.01(f)_. 

   

 (ii) Prior to the conversion of FCI Americas International Holdings Inc. and FCI USA Inc. to limited liability companies pursuant to the Reorganization Plan and at least five (5) days prior to the Closing Date, or if earlier, before December 31, 2009, Seller shall cause FCI USA Inc. to satisfy $15,000,000 of the outstanding obligations under the FCI Intercompany Note for cash. Prior to the Closing, but in any event, before December 31, 2009, Seller shall cause FCI Americas, Inc. to satisfy all of the remaining outstanding obligations under the FCI Intercompany Note for cash (such cash, together with the $15,000,000 paid by FCI USA, the " _Canadian Intercompany Note Cash_ "). Seller shall cause FCI Canada Inc. to invest, as soon as it is received, the Canadian Intercompany Note Cash in a dollar-denominated Eligible Investment and such investment shall remain in FCI Canada Inc. at the Closing.

In the course of the application under the Voluntary Disclosure Program, Seller, Buyer and their respective Affiliates shall attempt to negotiate with CRA for a set off (" _Set Off_ ") between (A) the Canadian withholding Taxes with respect to the FCI Intercompany Note, and (B) the Tax reimbursement of an amount determined under subsection 227(6.1) of the Income Tax Act (Canada). Each party agrees to cooperate fully and provide the other with such assistance as may reasonably be requested by the other party in connection with approaching CRA. If CRA accepts the VDP Application and agrees to the Set Off, Seller or its Affiliates shall pay immediately to the Receiver General of Canada the amount of interest or other Taxes computed by CRA and shall provide Buyer with acceptable proof of such payment. If CRA accepts the VDP Application but does not agree to the Set Off or does not accept the VDP Application, Seller shall pay immediately all Taxes due to the Canadian Taxing authorities with respect to the FCI Intercompany Note to the Receiver General of Canada and shall provide Buyer with acceptable proof of such payment. After Closing, Buyer and its Affiliates shall provide such assistance as is reasonably requested by Seller in applying for a Tax reimbursement pursuant to subsection 227(6.1) of the Income Tax Act (Canada). Any such reimbursement shall be paid to Seller. 

   #####

this Agreement, the relevant information shall be provided in such format
(including pro formas) as may be deemed appropriate by Buyer acting in good
faith. 

   

 (ii) Notwithstanding the provisions of _Section 10.01_, Seller shall not be required to make available to Buyer any portion of its Tax Returns relating to Taxes of the Seller or any of its post-Closing Affiliates (including any consolidated, combined or unitary group that includes Seller or its post-Closing Affiliates), _provided_ ,  _however_ , that if information contained in Tax Returns of the Seller or any of its post-Closing Affiliates is reasonably necessary to Buyer in making a determination under this Agreement, the relevant information shall be provided in such format (including pro formas) as may be deemed appropriate by Seller acting in good faith. 

  

 (m) _Payment_. Payment of any obligation under _Section 10.01(a)_ shall be effected by wire transfer of immediately available funds to an account(s) of the Company or its Subsidiaries as designated by the Indemnified Party and unless otherwise provided for in this  _Article X_ shall be made within thirty (30) days after the determination thereof or with respect to Taxes paid in connection with the filing of a Pre-Closing Tax Returns or Straddle Period Tax Returns three (3) days before the due date for the applicable Tax.

From time to time, as and when reasonably requested by either party hereto, the other party shall execute and deliver, or cause to be executed and delivered, all such documents and instruments and shall take, or cause to be taken, all such further or other actions (subject to the provisions of _Sections 6.04_,  _6.09_ , and _7.06_ ) reasonably necessary to transfer the Business from Seller to Buyer. 

   

 10.03 _Disclosure Generally_. The disclosures and exceptions to the representations and warranties set forth in the schedules attached hereto (the " _Disclosure Schedules_ ") are to be taken as relating to the representations and warranties of Seller and the Company as a whole, notwithstanding the fact that the Disclosure Schedules are arranged by sections corresponding to the sections in this Agreement or that a particular section of this Agreement makes reference to a specific section of the Disclosure Schedules, but only to the extent that it is readily apparent from the reading of the exception or qualification that such exception or qualification is applicable to such other representations and warranties. The inclusion of information in the Disclosure Schedules shall not be construed as or constitute an admission or agreement that a violation, right of termination, default, liability or other obligation of any kind exists with respect to any item, nor shall it be construed as or constitute an admission or agreement that such information is material to the Company or Seller. In addition, matters reflected in the Disclosure Schedules are not necessarily limited to matters required by this Agreement to be reflected in the Disclosure Schedules. Such additional matters are set forth for informational purposes only and do not necessarily include other matters of a similar nature.

warranty or covenant contained in this Agreement nor the inclusion of any
specific item in the Disclosure Schedules is intended to imply that such
amount, or higher or lower amounts, or the item so included or other items,
are or are not material, and no Person shall use the fact of the setting
forth of any such amount or the inclusion of any such item in any dispute
or controversy between the parties as to whether any obligation, item or
matter not described herein or included in the Disclosure Schedules is or is
not material for purposes of this Agreement. Further, neither the
specification of any item or matter in any representation, warranty
or covenant contained in this Agreement nor the inclusion of any specific
item in the Disclosure Schedules is intended to imply that such item or
matter, or other items or matters, are or are not in the ordinary course of
business, and no Person shall use the fact of setting forth or the inclusion
of any such items or matter in any dispute or controversy between the parties
as to whether any obligation, item or matter not described herein or included
in the Disclosure Schedules is or is not in the ordinary course of business
for purposes of this Agreement.

 11.04 _Assignment_. This Agreement and all of the provisions hereof shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the parties hereto and their respective successors and permitted assigns, except that neither this Agreement nor any of the rights, interests or obligations hereunder may be assigned or delegated by either Buyer, on the one hand, and the Company or Seller, on the other hand, without the prior written consent of the other party. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Buyer may, without the prior written consent of Seller, assign its rights and obligations hereunder in whole or in part to one or more Affiliates of Buyer which shall assume Buyers obligations and liabilities hereunder; _provided_ , that in each case Buyer shall remain liable for all obligations of Buyer hereunder. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Seller may assign its indemnification obligations under _Section 8.02(a)(vii)_ with the prior written consent of Buyer, such consent not to be unreasonably withheld (it being understood that such consent shall not be deemed to be unreasonably withheld if Buyer reasonably believes that any such assignee is not sufficiently creditworthy to satisfy the indemnification obligations then outstanding under _Section 8.02(a)(vii)_);  _provided_ , _however_ , that Buyer shall have no obligation to waive any rights or agree to any additional terms and conditions in connection with such assignment. 

   

 11.05 _Severability_. Whenever possible, each provision of this Agreement shall be interpreted in such manner as to be effective and valid under applicable law, but if any provision of this Agreement is held to be prohibited by or invalid under applicable law, such provision shall be ineffective only to the extent of such prohibition or invalidity, without invalidating the remainder of such provision or the remaining provisions of this Agreement, and the parties shall amend or otherwise modify this Agreement to replace any prohibited or invalid provision with an effective and valid provision that gives effect to the intent of the parties to the maximum extent permitted by applicable law. 

   

 11.06 _Construction_. Notwithstanding the fact that this Agreement has been drafted or prepared by one of the parties, each of Buyer, Seller and the Company confirm that they and their respective counsel have reviewed, negotiated and adopted this Agreement as the joint agreement and understanding of the parties hereto and the language used in this Agreement shall be deemed to be the language chosen by the parties hereto to express their mutual intent, and no rule of strict construction shall be applied against any Person. 

   

 11.07 _Amendment and Waiver_. Any provision of this Agreement or the Disclosure Schedules or Exhibits hereto may be amended or waived only in a writing signed by Buyer and Seller. No waiver of any provision hereunder or any breach or default thereof shall extend to or affect in any way any other provision or prior or subsequent breach or default. 

    ##### 

  

     

 11.08 _Complete Agreement_. This Agreement and the documents referred to herein (including the Confidentiality Agreement) contain the complete agreement between the parties hereto and supersede any prior understandings, agreements or representations by or between the parties, written or oral, which may have related to the subject matter hereof in any way. 

   

 11.09 _Third-Party Beneficiaries_. Subject to a proper assignment pursuant to _Section 11.04_, no Person other than the parties hereto shall have any rights, remedies, obligations or benefits under any provision of this Agreement, except for (a) the directors and officers of the Company and its Subsidiaries solely with respect to _Section 7.03_, and (b) Bain Capital solely with respect to _Section 6.07(c)_ and _Section 11.01_. 

   

 11.10 _Delivery by Facsimile_. This Agreement and any signed agreement entered into in connection herewith or contemplated hereby, and any amendments hereto or thereto, to the extent signed and delivered by means of a facsimile machine or electronic transmission in portable document formant (pdf), shall be treated in all manner and respects as an original contract and shall be considered to have the same binding legal effects as if it were the original signed version thereof delivered in person. At the request of any party hereto or to any such contract, each other party hereto or thereto shall re-execute original forms thereof and deliver them to all other parties. No party hereto or to any such contract shall raise the use of a facsimile machine or electronic transmission in portable document formant (pdf) to deliver a signature or the fact that any signature or contract was transmitted or communicated through the use of facsimile machine or electronic transmission in portable document formant (pdf) as a defense to the formation of a contract and each such party forever waives any such defense. 

   

 11.11 _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed in multiple counterparts (including by means of telecopied signature pages or electronic transmission in portable document formant (pdf)), any one of which need not contain the signatures of more than one party, but all such counterparts taken together shall constitute one and the same instrument. 

   

 11.12 _Conflict Between Transaction Documents_. The parties hereto agree and acknowledge that to the extent any terms and provisions of this Agreement are in any way inconsistent with or in conflict with any term, condition or provision of any other agreement, document or instrument contemplated hereby, this Agreement shall govern and control. 

   

 11.13 _Governing Law_. All issues and questions concerning the construction, validity, interpretation and enforceability of this Agreement and the exhibits and schedules hereto shall be governed by, and construed in accordance with, the laws of the State of Delaware, without giving effect to any choice of law or conflict of law rules or provisions (whether of the State of Delaware or any other jurisdiction) that would cause the application of the laws of any jurisdiction other than the State of Delaware. 

   

 11.14 _CONSENT TO JURISDICTION_. SUBJECT TO THE PROVISIONS OF _SECTION 2.02_ (WHICH SHALL GOVERN ANY DISPUTE ARISING THEREUNDER), THE PARTIES AGREE THAT JURISDICTION AND VENUE IN ANY SUIT, ACTION OR PROCEEDING BROUGHT BY ANY PARTY SEEKING INJUNCTIVE RELIEF PURSUANT TO THIS AGREEMENT SHALL PROPERLY AND EXCLUSIVELY LIE IN ANY FEDERAL 

   ##### 

  

   

OR STATE COURT LOCATED IN WILMINGTON, DELAWARE. EACH PARTY ALSO AGREES NOT TO
BRING ANY SUIT, ACTION OR PROCEEDING SEEKING INJUNCTIVE RELIEF ARISING OUT OF
OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT IN ANY OTHER COURT (OTHER THAN UPON THE APPEAL
OF ANY JUDGMENT, DECISION OR ACTION OF ANY SUCH COURT LOCATED IN WILMINGTON,
DELAWARE). BY EXECUTION AND DELIVERY OF THIS AGREEMENT, EACH PARTY
IRREVOCABLY SUBMITS TO THE JURISDICTION OF SUCH COURTS FOR ITSELF AND
IN RESPECT OF ITS PROPERTY WITH RESPECT TO SUCH SUIT, ACTION OR PROCEEDING.
THE PARTIES IRREVOCABLY AGREE THAT VENUE WOULD BE PROPER IN SUCH COURT, AND
HEREBY WAIVE ANY OBJECTION THAT ANY SUCH COURT IS AN IMPROPER OR INCONVENIENT
FORUM FOR THE RESOLUTION OF SUCH SUIT, ACTION OR PROCEEDING. THE PARTIES
FURTHER AGREE THAT THE MAILING BY CERTIFIED OR REGISTERED MAIL,
RETURN RECEIPT REQUESTED, OF ANY PROCESS REQUIRED BY ANY SUCH COURT SHALL
CONSTITUTE VALID AND LAWFUL SERVICE OF PROCESS AGAINST THEM, WITHOUT
NECESSITY FOR SERVICE BY ANY OTHER MEANS PROVIDED BY STATUTE OR RULE OF
COURT. 

   

 11.15 _WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL_. THE PARTIES TO THIS AGREEMENT EACH HEREBY WAIVES, TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, ANY RIGHT TO A JURY TRIAL OF ANY CLAIM, DEMAND, ACTION, OR CAUSE OF ACTION (I) ARISING UNDER THIS AGREEMENT OR (II) IN ANY WAY CONNECTED WITH OR RELATED OR INCIDENTAL TO THE DEALINGS OF THE PARTIES HERETO IN RESPECT OF THIS AGREEMENT OR ANY OF THE TRANSACTIONS RELATED HERETO, IN EACH CASE WHETHER NOW EXISTING OR HEREAFTER ARISING, AND WHETHER IN CONTRACT, TORT, EQUITY, OR OTHERWISE. THE PARTIES TO THIS AGREEMENT EACH HEREBY AGREES AND CONSENTS THAT ANY SUCH CLAIM, DEMAND, ACTION, OR CAUSE OF ACTION SHALL BE DECIDED BY COURT TRIAL WITHOUT A JURY AND THAT THE PARTIES TO THIS AGREEMENT MAY FILE AN ORIGINAL COUNTERPART OF A COPY OF THIS AGREEMENT WITH ANY COURT AS WRITTEN EVIDENCE OF THE CONSENT OF THE PARTIES HERETO TO THE WAIVER OF THEIR RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY. 

   

 11.16 _Specific Performance_. The parties hereto agree that irreparable damage would occur in the event that any of the provisions of this Agreement were not performed in accordance with their specific terms or were otherwise breached. It is accordingly agreed that Buyer, the Company and Seller shall be entitled to seek an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions hereof in any court having jurisdiction, this being in addition to any other remedy to which the parties are entitled at law or in equity.
