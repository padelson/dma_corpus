 **Exhibit 10.01**

 



 

 **GUARANTEE 
OF 
RANDSTAD HOLDING NV**

 



 

GUARANTEE, dated as of July 20, 2011 (this " _Guarantee_ "), by RANDSTAD
HOLDING NV (the " _Guarantor_ "), in favor of SFN Group, Inc., a Delaware
corporation (the " _Company_ ").

 



 

1. _GUARANTEE_. To induce the Company to enter into that certain Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated as of July 20, 2011 (as amended, supplemented or otherwise modified from time to time, the " _Merger Agreement_ ;" each capitalized term not defined herein shall have the meaning assigned to such term in the Merger Agreement), by and among **** Randstad North America, L.P., a Delaware limited partnership (" _Parent_ "), Cosmo Delaware Acquisition Corp., a Delaware corporation and a wholly-owned subsidiary of Parent (" _Merger Sub_ ") and the Company, pursuant to which Merger Sub will merge with and into the Company, with the Company as the Surviving Corporation, the Guarantor absolutely, unconditionally and irrevocably guarantees to the Company, the due and punctual observance, payment, performance and discharge of the obligations of Parent and Merger Sub pursuant to the Merger Agreement (collectively, the " _Obligations_ "). In addition to the foregoing, the Guarantor agrees to be bound by the terms and conditions of Section 6.09(a)(ii) of the Merger Agreement as if the Guarantor were the party thereto. The Guarantor will take such action and execute such additional documents (including without limitation any amendments to this Guarantee) as may be reasonably requested by the Company in order to render this Guarantee enforceable under the laws of the Netherlands.

 



 

2. _NATURE OF GUARANTEE_. The Company shall not be obligated to file any claim relating to the Obligations in the event that Parent or Merger Sub becomes subject to a bankruptcy, reorganization or similar proceeding, and the failure of the Company to so file shall not affect the Guarantors obligations hereunder. This is an unconditional guarantee of performance and not of collection. The Guarantor reserves the right to assert defenses which Parent or Merger Sub may have to payment of any Obligations that arise under the terms of the Merger Agreement.

 



 

3. _CHANGES IN OBLIGATIONS, CERTAIN WAIVERS_. The Guarantor agrees that the Company may at any time and from time to time, without notice to or further consent of the Guarantor, extend the time of payment of any of the Obligations, and may also make any agreement with Parent or Merger Sub for the extension, renewal, payment, compromise, discharge or release thereof, in whole or in part, or for any modification of the terms thereof or of any agreement between the Company and Parent or Merger Sub or any such other Person without in any way impairing or affecting this Guarantee. The Guarantor acknowledges that it will receive substantial direct and indirect benefits from the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Guarantee, the Company hereby agrees that to the extent Parent and Merger Sub are relieved of the Obligations (other than due to rejection of the Merger Agreement in the context of the bankruptcy or insolvency of Parent or Merger Sub), the Guarantor shall be similarly relieved of its Obligations under this Guarantee. Guarantor hereby unconditionally and irrevocably agrees not to exercise

      
 

 



 

any rights which it may acquire by way of subrogation under the Merger
Agreement, by any payment made hereunder or otherwise, until all of the
Obligations outstanding on the date such subrogation is sought shall have been
paid and/or performed in full.

 



 

4. _NO ASSIGNMENT_. Neither the Guarantor nor the Company may assign its rights, interests or obligations hereunder to any other person (except by operation of law) without the prior written consent of the Company or the Guarantor, as the case may be.

 



 

5. _NOTICES_. All notices and other communications hereunder shall be in writing in the English language and shall be given (a) on the date of delivery if delivered personally, (b) on the first Business Day following the date of dispatch if delivered by a nationally recognized next-day courier service, (c) on the fifth Business Day following the date of mailing if delivered by registered or certified mail (postage prepaid, return receipt requested) or (d) if sent by facsimile or electronic transmission, when transmitted and receipt is confirmed.
