defined in Section&nbsp;2.3 below) as determined in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles ("</FONT><FONT SIZE=2><I>GAAP</I></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>"), and in a manner consistent with
Seller's prior year's practices. For purposes of determining the Working Capital, (i)&nbsp;the Accounts Receivable shall be that which arose in the ordinary course to creditworthy customers, and the

the event Purchaser disagrees with Seller's determination of the Working Capital as of the Closing, then Purchaser shall notify Seller in writing within 10 business days after receipt of Seller's
calculation of the Working Capital as of the Closing, setting forth in reasonable detail the basis for such dispute. If Purchaser does not provide such notice within such 10 business day period, then
the determination of the Working Capital as of the Closing by Seller shall be final, binding and conclusive upon the parties hereto. If Purchaser does provide such notice, Purchaser and Seller shall
attempt in good faith to reconcile their differences and any resolution by them as to any disputed amount shall be final, binding and conclusive upon each of the parties hereto. If Purchaser and
Seller fail to reach a resolution within 10 business days after Seller's receipt of Purchaser's written notice of dispute, Purchaser and Seller shall submit the items remaining for resolution to
Deloitte&nbsp;&amp; Touche LLP or such other national accounting firm as may be agreed upon by Purchaser and Seller (the "Independent Accounting Firm"), which shall within 30 business days of submission
resolve and report to Seller and Purchaser upon such remaining disputed items, and such report shall be final, binding and conclusive upon each of the parties hereto. Purchaser and Seller agree that
the party which claims the greatest variance in Working Capital from that finally determined by the Independent Accounting Firm shall be responsible for the fees and disbursements of the Independent
Accounting Firm in connection with the resolution of such dispute. Seller or Purchaser, as the case may be, shall pay the adjustment to the Working Capital within 5 business days following its
