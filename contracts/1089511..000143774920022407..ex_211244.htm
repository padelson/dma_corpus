Parent has delivered to the Company true, correct and complete copies, as of the date hereof, of (i) each fully executed Equity Commitment Letter (the financing provided for therein being collectively referred to as the &#8220;<b>Equity Financing</b>&#8221;) and (ii) a fully executed commitment letter (together with all exhibits, schedules, and annexes thereto) and fee letter from the financial institutions identified therein, the &#8220;<b>Debt Financing Commitment Letter</b>&#8221; and, together with the Equity Commitment Letters, the &#8220;<b>Financing Commitment Letters</b>&#8221;) to provide, on the terms and subject only to the conditions expressly stated therein, debt financing in the amounts set forth therein; provided that fee amounts and pricing terms, including terms of the &#8220;market flex&#8221; and other commercially sensitive information, in the fee letter entered into in connection with the Debt Financing, may have been redacted to the extent, in each case, they are Permissible Redacted Terms. As of the date hereof, none of the Financing Commitment Letters has been withdrawn, terminated, repudiated, rescinded, amended, amended and restated or modified, no terms thereunder have been waived, and no such withdrawal, termination, repudiation, rescission, amendment, amendment and restatement, modification or waiver has occurred, and, to the extent related to any Person that is not an Affiliate of Parent, to the knowledge of Parent, there is no condition existing that would require any such withdrawal, termination, repudiation, rescission, amendment, amendment and restatement, modification or waiver, except to the extent any such amendment is not prohibited under this Agreement. Assuming the Equity Financing is funded in accordance with the Equity Commitment Letters and the Debt Financing is funded in accordance with the Debt Financing Commitment Letter, as applicable, the net proceeds contemplated by the Equity Commitment Letters, and the net proceeds contemplated by the Debt Financing Commitment Letter, will in the aggregate, be sufficient for Parent, Merger Sub and the Surviving Corporation to pay the amounts required to be paid in connection with the Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby, including payment of the Aggregate Merger Consideration, to make any repayment, repurchase or refinancing of debt of the Company and its Subsidiaries contemplated by this Agreement, to pay any other amounts required to be paid by Parent or Merger Sub on or prior to the Closing Date in connection with the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (the &#8220;<b>Required Amount</b>&#8221;), assuming the satisfaction of the conditions set forth in <u>Section 7.02(a)</u> and <u>Section 7.02(b)</u> on the Closing Date. Each Financing Commitment Letter is enforceable against Parent, Merger Sub (to the extent Parent or Merger Sub is a party thereto) and, to the knowledge of Parent, such other Persons party thereto in accordance with its terms, except as enforcement may be limited by bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization or similar Applicable Laws affecting creditors&#8217; rights generally and by general principles of equity. As of the date hereof, the Financing Commitment Letters are in full force and effect and assuming the satisfaction or waiver of the conditions set forth in <u>Section 7.01</u> and <u>Section 7.02</u> on the Closing Date, Parent has no reason to believe that any event has occurred which, with or without notice, lapse of time or both, would or would reasonably be expected to constitute a default or breach on the part of Parent or Merger Sub or, to the knowledge of Parent, any other parties thereto, under any of the Financing Commitment Letters. Assuming the satisfaction of the conditions set forth in <u>Section 7.01</u> and <u>Section 7.02</u> on the Closing Date, as of the date hereof, Parent does not have any reason to believe that the full amount under the Financing Commitment Letters will not be available to Parent or Merger Sub on the Closing Date. As of the date hereof, the Equity Commitment Letter contains all of the conditions precedent and other conditions to the obligations of the parties thereunder to make the full amount of the Equity Financing available to Parent on the terms therein. As of the date hereof, there are no side letters or other agreements, arrangements or understandings to which Parent or any Equity Investor is a party that would adversely affect the availability of the Equity Financing on the Closing Date, other than as expressly set forth in the Equity Commitment Letter provided to the Company on or prior to the date hereof. Each Equity Commitment Letter provides, and will continue to provide, that the Company is a third party beneficiary thereof as set forth therein. Parent and Merger Sub acknowledge and agree that their obligation to consummate the Merger and pay the Aggregate Merger Consideration is not conditioned on the availability of Debt Financing.</p>
