Section 2.03 _Conversion of Shares_. At the Effective Time, as a result

(b) each share of Company Common Stock held in the treasury of the Company
or owned directly by Parent or Merger Sub or any wholly-owned subsidiary of

Section 2.04 _Exchange and Payment_.

  



  

(a) Prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall appoint an exchange agent to
be mutually agreed by the Parties (the " **Exchange Agent** ") for the purpose
of exchanging for the Merger Consideration certificates representing shares of
Company Common Stock (the " **Certificates** "); _provided_ , _however_ , that
any references herein to "Certificates" are deemed to include references to
book-entry account statements relating to the ownership of shares of Company
Common Stock. Prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall deposit, or shall
cause to be deposited, with the Exchange Agent the aggregate per share Merger
Consideration (the " **Payment Fund** "). To the extent such fund diminishes
for any reason below the level required to make prompt payment of the Merger
Consideration, Parent shall promptly replace or restore, or cause to be
replaced or restored, the lost portion of such fund so as to ensure that it is
maintained at a level sufficient to make such payments. The Payment Fund shall
be invested by the Exchange Agent as directed by Parent; _provided_ that (i)
no such investment or losses thereon shall relieve Parent from making the
payments required by this _Article 2_ or affect the amount of Merger
Consideration payable hereunder, (ii) no such investment shall have maturities
that could prevent or delay payments to be made pursuant to this Agreement and
(iii) the Payment Fund shall not be invested in any instruments other than
direct short-term obligations of, or short-term obligations fully guaranteed
as to principal and interest by, the government of the United States of
America, in commercial paper obligations rated A-1 or P-1 or better by Moody's
Investors Service, Inc. or Standard and Poor's Financial Services LLC,
respectively, in certificates of deposit, bank repurchase agreements or
bankers' acceptances of commercial banks with capital exceeding $10 billion
(based on the most recent financial statements of such bank that are then
publicly available), or in money market funds having a rating in the highest
investment category granted by a recognized credit rating agency at the time
of investment. Any and all interest or other amounts earned with respect to
such funds shall become part of the Payment Fund. The Payment Fund shall not
be used for any other purpose. The Surviving Corporation shall (and Parent
shall cause the Surviving Corporation to) pay all charges and expenses,
including those of the Exchange Agent, in connection with the exchange of
shares of Company Common Stock and the payment of the Merger Consideration in
respect of such shares of Company Common Stock.

  



  

(b) Promptly after the Effective Time, and in any event no later than five
Business Days after the Effective Time, Parent shall send, or shall cause the
Exchange Agent to send, to each record holder of shares of Company Common
Stock at the Effective Time whose shares were converted into the right to
receive the Merger Consideration pursuant to _Section 2.03(a)_ a letter of
transmittal and instructions in customary form reasonably satisfactory to the
Company (which shall specify that the delivery shall be effected, and risk of
loss and title shall pass, only upon proper delivery or transfer of the
Certificates (or affidavits of loss in lieu of the Certificates pursuant to
_Section 2.04(e)_ ) to the Exchange Agent) for use in such exchange. Each
holder of shares of Company Common Stock that have been converted into the
right to receive the Merger Consideration shall be entitled to receive the
Merger Consideration in respect of the shares of Company Common Stock
represented by a Certificate upon (i) surrender to the Exchange Agent of a
Certificate, together with a duly completed and validly executed letter of
transmittal, or (ii) receipt of an "agent's message" by the Exchange Agent (or
such other evidence, if any, of transfer as the Exchange Agent may reasonably
request) in the case of a book-entry transfer of shares of Company Common
Stock, and, in each case, delivery to the Exchange Agent of such other
documents as may reasonably be requested by the Exchange Agent. Until so
surrendered or transferred, each such Certificate shall represent after the
Effective Time for all purposes only the right to receive such Merger
Consideration. No interest shall be paid or accrued on the cash payable upon
the surrender or transfer of such Certificate.

  



  

 

 

 

20

   

 



 

 

 

  



  

(c) If any portion of the Merger Consideration is to be paid to a Person
other than the Person in whose name the surrendered Certificate is registered,
it shall be a condition to such payment that (i) either such Certificate shall
be properly endorsed or shall otherwise be in proper form for transfer and
(ii) the Person requesting such payment shall pay to the Exchange Agent any
transfer Tax required as a result of such payment to a Person other than the
registered holder of such Certificate or establish to the satisfaction of the
Exchange Agent that such Tax has been paid or is not payable.

  



  

(d) All Merger Consideration paid upon the surrender of Certificates in
accordance with the terms hereof shall be deemed to have been paid in full
satisfaction of all rights pertaining to the shares of Company Common Stock
formerly represented by such Certificate and from and after the Effective
Time, there shall be no further registration of transfers of shares of Company
Common Stock on the stock transfer books of the Surviving Corporation. If,
after the Effective Time, Certificates are presented to the Surviving
Corporation, they shall be canceled and exchanged for the Merger Consideration
as provided for, and in accordance with the procedures set forth, in this
_Article 2_.

  



  

(e) If any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the
holder's compliance with the replacement requirements established by the
Exchange Agent, including, if necessary, the posting by such Person of a bond,
in such customary amount as the Surviving Corporation may direct, as indemnity
against any claim that may be made against it with respect to such
Certificate, the Exchange Agent will pay, in exchange for such lost, stolen or
destroyed Certificate, the Merger Consideration to be paid in respect of the
shares of Company Common Stock formerly represented by such Certificate, as
contemplated under this _Article 2_.

  



  

(f) Any portion of the Payment Fund that remains unclaimed by the holders
of shares of Company Common Stock 12 months after the Effective Time shall be
delivered to the Surviving Corporation, upon demand, and any such holder who
has not exchanged shares of Company Common Stock for the Merger Consideration
in accordance with this _Section 2.04_ prior to that time shall thereafter
look only to Parent and the Surviving Corporation for payment of the Merger
Consideration.

  



  

Section 2.05 _Dissenting Shares_. Notwithstanding _Section 2.03_ , shares
of Company Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time and held by a holder who has not voted in favor of adoption of
this Agreement or consented thereto in writing, who is entitled to appraisal
and who has properly exercised appraisal rights for such shares in accordance
with Section 262 of the DGCL shall not be converted into a right to receive
the Merger Consideration but instead shall be entitled to payment of the
appraised value of such shares in accordance with Section 262 of the DGCL,
following which such shares shall automatically be canceled and shall cease to
exist; _provided_ , _however_ , that if, after the Effective Time, such holder
fails to perfect, withdraws or loses such holder's right to appraisal,
pursuant to Section 262 of the DGCL or if a court of competent jurisdiction
shall determine that such holder is not entitled to the relief provided by
Section 262 of the DGCL, such shares of Company Common Stock shall be treated
as if they had been converted as of the Effective Time into the right to
receive the Merger Consideration in accordance with _Section 2.03(a)_ ,
without interest thereon, upon surrender of such Certificate formerly
representing such share. The Company shall provide Parent prompt written
notice of any demands received by the Company for appraisal of shares of
Company Common Stock, any withdrawal of any such demand and any other demand,
notice or instrument delivered to the Company prior to the Effective Time
pursuant to Section 262 of the DGCL that relates to such demand, and Parent
shall have the opportunity and right to participate in all negotiations and
Proceedings with respect to such demands. Except with the prior written
consent of Parent, the Company shall not make any payment with respect to, or
offer to settle or settle, any such demands.

without any action on the part of the holders thereof, each Company RSU Award
that is outstanding as of immediately prior to the Effective Time, whether or
not vested, shall not be assumed by Parent or Merger Sub in the Merger and
shall be canceled and extinguished as of the Effective Time and, in exchange
therefor, each holder of any such Company RSU Award shall have the right to

Company Common Stock subject to such Company RSU Award by (ii) the Merger
Consideration (such amounts payable hereunder, the " **RSU Award Payments**
"). From and after the Effective Time, the holder of any canceled Company RSU

at least two Business Days following the Closing Date; _provided_ , that such
payment may be made at such other time or times following the Effective Time
consistent with the terms of the Company RSU Award to the extent necessary, as
determined by Parent, to avoid the imposition of additional tax under Section
409A of the Code. All payments provided pursuant to this _Section 2.06(a)_

and, in exchange therefor, each former holder of any such Company PSU Award
shall have the right to receive from Parent or the Surviving Corporation an
amount in cash equal to the product obtained by multiplying (i) the aggregate
number of shares of Company Common Stock subject to such Company PSU Award,
(it being agreed that the aggregate number of shares of Company Common Stock
subject to any such Company PSU Award will be determined based on the degree
of achievement of the performance goals set forth in the applicable award
agreement (e.g., relating to free cash flow or stock appreciation) as of the
Effective Time or such earlier time as determined by the Committee (as defined
in the Company Stock Plan) and such Company PSU Awards will no longer be
subject to any performance-based vesting conditions) by (ii) the Merger
Consideration (such amounts payable hereunder, the " **PSU Award Payments**
"). From and after the Effective Time, the holder of any canceled Company PSU
Award shall be entitled to receive only the PSU Award Payment in respect of
such canceled Company PSU Award. At or prior to the Effective Time, Parent

of the employment of the former holder of such Company PSU Award without
"cause" (as required by, and in accordance with, the Company Stock Plan), in
any case without interest; _provided_ that any PSU Award Payment may be made
at such other time or times following the Effective Time consistent with the
terms of the Company PSU Award to the extent necessary, as determined by

Section 4.01 _Organization, Standing and Power_. The Company is a
corporation duly incorporated, validly existing and in good standing under the

the Company in accordance with its terms, except as such enforceability may be
limited by bankruptcy, insolvency, moratorium and other similar Applicable
Laws affecting creditors' rights generally and by general principles of
specific performance, injunctive relief and other equitable remedies.

  



  

(b) At a meeting duly called and held, prior to the execution of this

the stockholders of the Company (the " **Company Recommendation** "), which
resolutions have not been rescinded, modified or withdrawn, except as
permitted in _Section 6.03_. The Company is not party to and does not have in
force any stockholder rights agreement or "poison pill" or similar anti-
takeover agreement or plan. The Company Board has taken all necessary action
so that Section 203 of the DGCL or any similar anti-takeover, moratorium, or
"control share" law applicable to the Company does not, and will not, apply to
this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby.

designed and maintained to ensure that (i) all information (both financial and
non-financial) required to be disclosed by the Company in the reports that it
files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and
reported to the individuals responsible for preparing such reports within the
time periods specified in the rules and forms of the SEC and (ii) all such

(a) Each of the Company and its Subsidiaries is, and, for the past three
years has been, in compliance in all material respects with all Applicable
Laws. Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has received any written
notice since January 1, 2018 that remains unresolved (i) of any
administrative, regulatory, civil or criminal investigation or material audit
or inspection by any Governmental Authority relating to the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries or (ii) from any Governmental Authority alleging that the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries is not in compliance with any Applicable
Law.

  



  

(b) Each of the Company and its Subsidiaries has, and since January 1,
2018 has had, in effect all Governmental Permits necessary or legally required
for it to own, lease or otherwise hold and operate its properties and assets
and to carry on its businesses and operations as now conducted (or as
conducted as of such prior time, as applicable) except for any such
Governmental Permits the lack of which would not have a Company Material

under, violations of, or events giving rise to any right of termination,
amendment, suspension or cancelation of any such Governmental Permits, and as

any such Governmental Permits is pending or, to the Knowledge of the Company,
threatened in writing.

(c) _Part 4.12(c)_ of the Company Disclosure Schedule sets forth all
material Governmental Permits issued or granted to it by (i) the FCC,

Licenses, the Company State Licenses, and the Locality Permits, the "
**Company Communications Licenses** ").

  



  

(d) The Company and each licensee of each of its Subsidiaries is in good
standing with the FCC and all other Governmental Authorities in all material
respects, and neither the Company nor any such licensee is, to the Knowledge
of the Company, the respondent with respect to any formal complaint,
investigation, audit, inquiry, subpoena, forfeiture, or petition to suspend

Governmental Authority.

  



  

(e) The Company and its Subsidiaries have good and valid title to, free

Communications Licenses is valid and in full force and effect and has not been
suspended, revoked, canceled or adversely modified. No Company Communication
License is subject to (i) any condition or requirement that has not been
imposed generally upon licenses in the same service, unless such conditions or
requirements are set forth on the face of the applicable authorization or (ii)
any pending action by or before the FCC or any PUC to suspend, revoke or
cancel, or any judicial review of a decision by the FCC or any PUC with
respect thereto. There is no (A) to the Knowledge of the Company, event,
condition or circumstance attributable specifically to the Company that would
preclude any Company Communication License from being renewed in the ordinary
course (to the extent that such Company Communication License is renewable by
its terms), or (B) pending or, to the Knowledge of the Company, threatened FCC
or PUC regulatory action relating specifically to one or more of the Company
Communications Licenses. No Company Communication License, order or other
agreement, obtained from, issued by or concluded with any PUC imposes or would
impose restrictions on the ability of any Subsidiary to make payments,
dividends or other distributions to the Company or any other Subsidiary that
limits, or would reasonably be expected to limit, the cash funding and
management alternatives of the Company on a consolidated basis in a manner
disproportionate to restrictions applied by such PUC to similarly situated

Company, each licensee of such wireless spectrum is in compliance in all
material respects with all of its obligations under the FCC Rules with respect
to each Governmental Authorization to which any such lease relates, and, to
the Knowledge of the Company, there are no facts or circumstances that would
reasonably be likely (whether with or without notice, lapse of time or the
occurrence of any other event) to preclude the renewal or extension of any
such lease in the ordinary course of business. As of the date hereof, none of
the Company or its Subsidiaries has, nor to the Knowledge of the Company has
any other party to any such lease, claimed that any party to any such lease is
in breach or default under such lease, and any past breach or default has been
waived, cured or otherwise settled. To the Knowledge of the Company, all
Company FCC licenses underlying all such leases were validly issued and are in
full force and effect, and, as of the date hereof, are not subject to
proceedings or threatened proceedings that would reasonably be expected to
result in the revocation, modification, restriction, cancellation,
termination, suspension or non-renewal, in each case, in any material respect,
of any such Company FCC License.

such other Governmental Authority in currently effective filings, and

cable systems, or other network facilities have been preceded by the
submission to the FCC, PUC, or any other applicable Governmental Authority of
all required filings, in each case, except as, individually or in the

its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole. All facilities constructed by the Company
or any of its Subsidiaries for the purpose of demonstrating compliance with

requirements, remain constructed and are currently being operated as

regulations of the FAA (the " **FAA Rules** "), in each case, except as would
not be material to the Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole.
Appropriate notification to the FAA has been made for each transmission tower
owned or leased by the Company and its Subsidiaries to the extent required to
be made by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries by, and in accordance with,
the FAA Rules.

any Third Party theretofore conducted by the Company, its Subsidiaries or
their respective Representatives with respect to an Acquisition Proposal
(including terminating access to any electronic data room), and promptly
(within two Business Days after the No-Shop Period Start Date), the Company
shall request that all non-public information previously provided by or on

contact such Third Party making the Acquisition Proposal solely to clarify the
terms and conditions thereof or to request that any Acquisition Proposal made
orally be made in writing and (ii) if the Company Board or any committee
thereof determines, in good faith after consultation with a Company Financial
Advisor and outside legal counsel, that such Acquisition Proposal constitutes,
or would reasonably be expected to result in, a Superior Proposal, then the
Company and its Representatives may (A) furnish information and data with
respect to the Company and its Subsidiaries to the Third Party making such
Acquisition Proposal and afford such Third Party access to the businesses,
properties, assets and personnel of the Company and its Subsidiaries and (B)
enter into, maintain and participate in discussions or negotiations with the
Third Party making such Acquisition Proposal regarding such Acquisition
Proposal or otherwise cooperate with or assist or participate in, or knowingly
facilitate, any such discussions or negotiations; _provided_ , _however_ ,
that the Company (1) shall not, shall cause its Subsidiaries not to and shall

within two Business Days) provide to Parent any material non-public
information or other data or information concerning the Company or its
Subsidiaries or access provided to such Third Party, in each case, which was
not previously provided to Parent. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the parties
agree that, notwithstanding the commencement of the obligations of the Company
under _Section 6.02(b)_ on the No-Shop Period Start Date, the Company, its
Subsidiaries and their Representatives may continue to engage in the
activities described in _Section 6.02(a)_ with respect to any Excluded Party

the material terms and conditions of such Acquisition Proposal) and the
identity of the Third Party making such Acquisition Proposal; _provided_ ,
that if the Company is specifically prohibited from disclosing the identity of
any Person making an Acquisition Proposal, the Company may redact that
identity and any other identifying information but shall otherwise provide all
such information relating to the Acquisition Proposal (except to the extent
providing such information would violate a confidentiality agreement in effect
between the Company and a Third Party as of the date hereof). The Company
shall thereafter keep Parent reasonably informed on a reasonably current basis
of the status of any material developments, regarding any such Acquisition
Proposal, and the material terms and conditions thereof (including any change
in price or form of consideration or other material amendment thereto),
including by providing a copy of any agreements (draft or final) or other
material documentation relating thereto that is exchanged between the Third
Party (or its Representatives) making such Acquisition Proposal and the
Company (or its Representatives) within two Business Days after receipt
thereof. For the avoidance of doubt, all information provided to Parent or its
Representatives pursuant to this _Section 6.02_ will be subject to the terms

(after consultation with a Company Financial Advisor and outside legal
counsel), after giving effect to all of the adjustments to the terms in this
Agreement proposed in writing by Parent and Merger Sub in response to such
Acquisition Proposal, that (i) such Acquisition Proposal constitutes a
Superior Proposal and (ii) the failure to take the actions below would be

Change and/or (B) cause the Company to terminate this Agreement pursuant to

(B) unless, during such four Business Day period, the Company shall, and
shall cause its Representatives to, to the extent requested by Parent,
negotiate with Parent and its Representatives in good faith to make such
adjustments to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, the Guarantees and
the Financing Commitment Letters as would enable the Company Board to maintain
the Company Recommendation in connection with a Superior Proposal and not make
an Adverse Recommendation Change or terminate this Agreement pursuant to
_Section 8.01(h)_ ; and

  



  

 

 

 

62

   

 



 

 

 

  



  

(C) unless, following the expiration of such four Business Day period, the
Company Board has considered in good faith Parent's proposal, if any, to
adjust the terms and conditions of this Agreement, the Guarantees and the
Financing Commitment Letters, and the Company Board determines in good faith
(after consultation with a Company Financial Advisor and outside legal
counsel) that after giving effect to all of the adjustments to the terms in
this Agreement proposed in writing by Parent and Merger Sub in response to
such Acquisition Proposal, that the Acquisition Proposal continues to be a
Superior Proposal (it being understood and agreed that if Parent makes a
proposal to adjust the terms and conditions of this Agreement, the Guarantees
and the Financing Commitment Letters and the Company Board determines that
such Acquisition Proposal no longer constitutes a Superior Proposal, Parent,
Merger Sub and the Company shall promptly enter into amendments to such

Recommendation Change, if the Company Board determines in good faith (after
consultation with a Company Financial Advisor and outside legal counsel), that
(x) an Intervening Event has occurred and is continuing, and (y) the failure
to make such Adverse Recommendation Change would be inconsistent with its
fiduciary duties under Applicable Law; _provided_ , _however_ , that no such
Adverse Recommendation Change may be made:

  



  

(A) until after the fourth Business Day following written notice from the
Company advising Parent that the Company Board intends to take such action and
specifying the material facts underlying the determination by the Company
Board that an Intervening Event has occurred, and the reason for the Adverse
Recommendation Change, in reasonable detail (a " **Notice of Intervening
Event** ");

  



  

(B) unless, during such four Business Day period, the Company shall, and
shall cause its Representatives to, to the extent requested by Parent,
negotiate with Parent in good faith to enable Parent to amend this Agreement,
the Guarantees and the Financing Commitment Letters in such a manner that
obviates the need for an Adverse Recommendation Change; and

  



  

(C) unless, following the expiration of such four Business Day period, the
Company Board determines in good faith, taking into consideration any
amendments to this Agreement, the Guarantees and the Financing Commitment
Letters proposed in writing by Parent (after consultation with a Company
Financial Advisor and outside legal counsel), that the failure to effect an
Adverse Recommendation Change would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties
under Applicable Law (it being understood and agreed that if Parent makes a
proposal to adjust the terms and conditions of this Agreement, the Guarantee
and the Financing Commitment Letters and the Company Board determines that
such Intervening Event no longer requires an Adverse Recommendation Change,
Parent, Merger Sub and the Company shall promptly enter into amendments to
such agreements to embody the terms of such proposal).

  



  

 

 

 

63

   

 



 

 

 

  



  

The provisions of this _Section 6.03_ _(_ _b)(iii)_ shall also apply to any
material change to the facts and circumstances relating to an Intervening
Event, in which case such change shall require a new Notice of Intervening
Event and the Company shall be required to comply again with the provisions of
this _Section 6.03_ _(b)(iii)_.

  



  

(c) Nothing contained in _Section 6.02_ or this _Section 6.03_ or
elsewhere in this Agreement shall prohibit the Company from (i) taking and
disclosing a position contemplated by Rule 14d-9, Rule 14e-2(a) or Item
1012(a) of Regulation M-A promulgated under the Exchange Act with regard to an
Acquisition Proposal, (ii) making any disclosure to the Company's stockholders
if, in the good faith judgment of the Company Board or any committee thereof,
after consultation with outside legal counsel, such disclosure is required
under Applicable Law, or (iii) making any disclosure that constitutes a stop,
look and listen communication or similar communication of the type
contemplated by Section 14d-9(f) promulgated under the Exchange Act;
_provided_ , _however_ , that the Company may only make any such disclosure
that constitutes an Adverse Recommendation Change in compliance with _Section
6.03(b)_.

  



  

Section 6.04 _Preparation of Proxy Statement; Stockholders ' Meeting_.

  



  

(a) As promptly as reasonably practicable (and in any event within twenty
(20) Business Days) after the No-Shop Period Start Date, the Company shall
prepare a proxy statement in preliminary form (together with any amendments
thereof or supplements thereto and any other required proxy materials, the "
**Proxy Statement** ") for a special meeting of the Company's stockholders
(including any adjournments and postponements thereof, the " **Stockholder
Meeting** ") and file it with the SEC, and the Company and Parent shall
cooperate with each other in connection with the preparation of the foregoing,
including to collect from their respective Affiliates, as applicable, any
necessary information for the preparation of the foregoing. The Company shall
use commercially reasonable efforts to have the Proxy Statement cleared by the
SEC as promptly as practicable after the filing thereof, including using its
commercially reasonable efforts to respond as promptly as reasonably
practicable to any comments received from the SEC or its staff concerning the
Proxy Statement. The Company shall notify the other parties hereto promptly
upon the receipt of any comments from the SEC or its staff or any other
government officials and of any request by the SEC or its staff or any other
government officials for amendments or supplements to the Proxy Statement and
shall supply the others with copies of all correspondence between it or any of
its Representatives, on the one hand, and the SEC, or its staff or any other
government officials, on the other hand, with respect to the Proxy Statement.
Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, each of Parent and Merger
Sub shall cooperate with the Company, and shall collect from their Affiliates
any necessary information, in connection with the preparation and filing of
the Proxy Statement, including promptly furnishing to the Company in writing
upon request any and all information relating to Parent, Merger Sub and their
respective Affiliates as may be required to be set forth in the Proxy
Statement under Applicable Law. Parent shall ensure that such information
supplied by it and its Affiliates for inclusion in the Proxy Statement will
not, on the date the Proxy Statement is first mailed to stockholders of the
Company and at the time of the Stockholder meeting, contains any untrue
statement of material fact or omits to state any material fact required to be
stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light
of the circumstances under which they are made, not misleading.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary stated above, prior to filing or
mailing the Proxy Statement (or any amendment or supplement thereto), or
responding to any comments of the SEC with respect thereto, the Company shall
provide Parent and its counsel with a reasonable opportunity to review and
comment on such document or response and shall consider Parent's comments in
good faith. The Company shall pay all filing fees required to be paid to the
SEC in connection with the Proxy Statement.

  



  

 

 

 

64

   

 



 

 

 

  



  

(b) The Company shall ensure that the Proxy Statement (i) will not, on the
date it is first mailed to stockholders of the Company and at the time of the
Stockholder Meeting, contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit
to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order
to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they
are made, not misleading and (ii) will comply as to form in all material
respects with the applicable requirements of the Exchange Act. Notwithstanding
the foregoing, the Company assumes no responsibility with respect to
information supplied by or on behalf of Parent or Merger Sub or their
Affiliates in writing for inclusion or incorporation by reference in the Proxy
Statement. If, prior to the Stockholder Meeting, the Company, Parent or Merger
Sub discovers that information supplied by Parent and its Affiliates in
writing for inclusion in the Proxy Statement contains any untrue statement of
a material fact or omits to state any material fact required to be stated
therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of the
circumstances under which they are made, not misleading, the party hereto
which discovers such information shall promptly notify the other parties
hereto and the Company shall promptly prepare and file with the SEC an
appropriate amendment or supplement to the Proxy Statement and, to the extent
required by Applicable Law or the SEC or its staff, disseminate such amendment
or supplement to the Company's stockholders.

  



  

(c) As promptly as reasonably practicable following the clearance of the
Proxy Statement by the SEC (and in any event within ten Business Days after
clearance by the SEC), the Company shall duly set a record date for the
Stockholder Meeting and cause the Proxy Statement in definitive form and
notice of the Stockholder Meeting to be mailed to the Company's stockholders.
As promptly as reasonably practicable following the mailing of the Proxy
Statement to the Company's stockholders, the Company shall in accordance with
Applicable Law and the Company's governing documents, convene and hold the
Stockholder Meeting for the purpose of considering and taking action upon the
matters requiring Stockholder Approval; _provided_ that notwithstanding
anything else to the contrary herein, the Company may postpone or adjourn the
Stockholder Meeting (i) with the consent of Parent, (ii) for the absence of a
quorum necessary to conduct the business of the Stockholder Meeting, (iii)
after consultation with Parent, to ensure that any necessary supplement or
amendment to the Proxy Statement is provided to the holders of shares of
Company Common Stock within a reasonable amount of time in advance of the
Stockholder Meeting, (iv) after consultation with Parent, to allow for
additional time for the solicitation of proxies in order to obtain the
Stockholder Approval, or (v) if the Company is required to postpone or adjourn
the Company Meeting by applicable Law, _provided_ , _however_ , that the
Company may not postpone the Stockholders Meeting for more than an aggregate
of twenty Business Days without the prior written consent of Parent (which
shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed). The Company shall
consult with Parent to set the record date for the Stockholder Meeting and
shall not change the record date or set a new record date for the Stockholder
Meeting without consulting with Parent in good faith. Unless the Company Board
or any committee thereof has made an Adverse Recommendation Change in
compliance with _Section 6.03_ , the Company shall (x) make the Company
Recommendation to the stockholders of the Company and include such
recommendation in the Proxy Statement, (y) use its commercially reasonable
efforts to cause the definitive Proxy Statement to be mailed to the Company's
stockholders and to solicit from stockholders of the Company proxies in favor
of the adoption of this Agreement and (z) take all other action necessary or
advisable to secure the vote of the holders of shares of Company Common Stock
required by Applicable Law to effect the Merger. In the event of an Adverse
Recommendation Change, the Company shall continue to submit this Agreement to
the stockholders of the Company for approval at the Stockholder Meeting unless
this Agreement shall have been terminated in accordance with its terms prior
to the Stockholder Meeting.

  



  

Section 6.05 _Access to Information_. Subject to Applicable Law and
applicable contractual restrictions, from the date hereof to the Effective
Time or the earlier termination of this Agreement, upon reasonable notice, the
Company shall (and shall cause its Subsidiaries to) afford Parent's officers
and Parent's other authorized Representatives reasonable access, during normal
business hours, to its properties, books, Contracts, personnel, Tax Returns
and records (including via remote or electronic means). The foregoing shall
not require the Company (a) to provide access to or otherwise make available
or furnish any books, Contracts or records if such access would violate a
confidentiality, non-disclosure or other similar agreement in effect as of the
date hereof, (b) to provide access to or otherwise make available or furnish
any information if and to the extent that the provision of such information
would in the good faith judgment of the Company based on advice of outside
counsel jeopardize any attorney-client, work product or other legal privilege
or protection (it being agreed that, (i) in the case of clauses (a) and (b),
that the Company shall give notice to Parent of the fact that it is
withholding such information or documents and thereafter the Company and
Parent shall use their respective reasonable best efforts to cause such
information to be provided in a manner that would not reasonably be expected
to violate such restriction or waive the applicable privilege or protection
and (ii) in the case of clause (a), the Company shall use commercially
reasonable efforts to obtain any consents of Third Parties that are necessary
to permit such access), (c) to provide access to or otherwise make available
or furnish any information if and to the extent that the provision of such
information would reasonably be expected to, in the judgment of the Company
based on advice of outside counsel, violate any Applicable Law or (d) as
determined by the Company in consultation with Parent in good faith,
jeopardize the health and safety of any employee of the Company of its
Subsidiaries in light of the COVID-19 virus or any COVID-19 Measures.
Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, Parent and Merger Sub shall
provide the Company with at least 24 hours prior notice before Parent, Merger
Sub or their respective Representatives acting on their behalf contacts any
customer, partner, vendor, supplier or employee of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries in connection with the Merger or any of the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, and shall provide the Company with an
opportunity to participate in any such discussions. All requests for
information made pursuant to this _Section 6.05_ shall be directed the Persons
designated by the Company. All such information provided by or behalf of the
Company or its Subsidiaries pursuant to this _Section 6.05_ shall be kept
confidential in accordance with the Confidentiality Agreement.

Section 6.06 _Notice of Certain Events_. Each of the Company and Parent
will give prompt notice to the other (and will subsequently keep the other
informed on a reasonably current basis of any material developments related to
such notice) upon its becoming aware of (i) the occurrence or existence of any
fact, event or circumstance that (x) with respect to the Company, has had or
could have a Company Material Adverse Effect, (y) with respect to Parent or
Merger Sub, has had or could have a Parent Material Adverse Effect and/or (z)
would reasonably be expected to result in any of the conditions set forth in
_Article 7_ not being able to be satisfied prior to the End Date, or (ii) any
written notice or other written communication that has been received by the
Company from any Person alleging that the consent of such Person is or may be
required in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.
No notification given by any party pursuant to this _Section 6.06_ shall limit
or otherwise affect any of the representations, warranties, covenants,
obligations or conditions contained in this Agreement or otherwise limit or
affect the remedies available hereunder to the party receiving such notice.

  



  

Section 6.07 _Employee Benefit Plan Matters_.

  



  

(a) As of the Closing Date, the Surviving Corporation or one of its
Subsidiaries will continue to employ the employees of the Company and its
Subsidiaries as of the Effective Time. From and after the Closing Date, with
respect to employees of the Company or its Subsidiaries immediately before the
Effective Time who continue employment with Parent, the Surviving Corporation
or any Subsidiary of Parent or the Surviving Corporation following the Closing
Date (" **Continuing Employees** "), Parent shall cause the service of each
such Continuing Employee prior to the Effective Time to be recognized for
purposes of eligibility to participate in, and levels of benefits (but not for
purposes of any equity or equity-based compensation, long-term incentive,
change in control, retention or other one-time or special incentive
compensation, defined benefit pension or retiree medical or similar benefits
(collectively, " **Excluded Benefits** ")) under, each compensation,
retirement, vacation, paid time off, fringe or other welfare benefit plan,
program or arrangement of Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any of their
Subsidiaries (collectively, the " **Parent Benefit Plans** ") in which any
Continuing Employee is or becomes eligible to participate, but solely to the
extent service was credited to such employee for such purposes under a
comparable Company Employee Plan immediately prior to the Closing Date and to
the extent such credit would not result in a duplication of benefits.

  



  

(b) For a period of 12 months after the Closing Date (or, if shorter, for
so long as the applicable Continuing Employee remains employed by the
Surviving Corporation or its Subsidiaries), the Surviving Corporation or its
applicable Subsidiary will (or Parent will cause the Surviving Corporation or
its applicable Subsidiary to) provide each Continuing Employee (other than any
employee covered by a Collective Bargaining Agreement, whose compensation and
benefits shall be governed by the applicable Collective Bargaining Agreement)
with (i) (A) annual base salary or base hourly rate and (B) cash incentive
compensation opportunities (including commissions and other than the Excluded
Benefits), in each case in an amount at least equal to the level or
opportunity that was provided to each such Continuing Employee prior to the
Closing Date to the extent disclosed to Parent as of the date hereof (or
modified hereafter in accordance with _Section 6.01_ ), and (ii) employee
benefits (other than the Excluded Benefits) that are no less favorable in the
aggregate than those provided to similarly situated employees of the Company
and its Subsidiaries prior to the Closing to the extent disclosed to Parent as
of the date hereof, in each case without giving effect to any reduction in
annual base salary, base hourly rate, cash incentive compensation
opportunities or employee benefits in response to or otherwise related to the
coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic

  



  

 

 

 

66

   

 



 

 

 

  



  

(c) From and after the Closing Date, with respect to each Parent Benefit
Plan that is an "employee welfare benefit plan" as defined in Section 3(1) of
ERISA in which any Continuing Employee is or becomes eligible to participate,
Parent shall, or shall cause the Surviving Corporation or its applicable
Subsidiary to, use commercially reasonable efforts to cause each such Parent
Benefit Plan to (i) waive all limitations as to pre-existing conditions,
waiting periods and required physical examinations with respect to
participation and coverage requirements applicable under such Parent Benefit
Plan for such Continuing Employees and their eligible dependents to the same
extent that such pre-existing conditions, waiting periods and required
physical examinations would not have applied or would have been waived under
the corresponding Company Employee Plan in which such Continuing Employee was
a participant immediately prior to his or her commencement of participation in
such Parent Benefit Plan; _provided_ , _however_ , that for purposes of
clarity, to the extent such benefit coverage includes eligibility conditions
based on periods of employment, _Section 6.07(a)_ shall control; and (ii)
provide each Continuing Employee and their eligible dependents with credit for
any co-payments and deductibles paid in the calendar year that, and prior to
the date that, such Continuing Employee commences participation in such Parent
Benefit Plan in satisfying any applicable co-payment or deductible
requirements under such Parent Benefit Plan for the applicable calendar year,
to the extent that such expenses were recognized for such purposes under the
comparable Company Employee Plan.

  



  

(d) The Company shall permit, and cause its Subsidiaries to permit, Parent
to contact and make arrangements with the Company's or its Subsidiary's
employees regarding employment or prospective employment with the Surviving
Corporation after the Effective Time and for the purpose of ensuring the
continuity of the business, and the Company agrees not to discourage, and to
cause its Subsidiaries not to discourage, any such employees from consulting
with Parent.

  



  

(e) Immediately prior to the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and
without any action on the part of the holders thereof, each 2018 Cash Award
and Deferred Cash Award, in each case that is outstanding as of immediately
prior to the Effective Time, shall be canceled and extinguished and, in
exchange therefor, each holder of any such award shall have the right to
receive from Parent or the Surviving Corporation an amount in cash equal to
the full amount of such award (such amounts payable hereunder, the " **Cash**
**Award Payments** "). From and after the Effective Time, the holder of any
canceled 2018 Cash Award or Deferred Cash Award shall be entitled to receive
only the Cash Award Payment in respect of such canceled award. At or prior to
the Effective Time, Parent shall deposit, or shall cause to be deposited, by
wire transfer, immediately available funds sufficient to pay the aggregate
Cash Award Payments to an account identified by the Company prior to the
Effective Time. The Cash Award Payments described in this _Section 6.07_ _(e)_
with respect to (i) the 2018 Cash Awards shall be made by the Surviving
Corporation not later than the next regularly scheduled payroll date that is
at least two Business Days following the Closing Date, and (ii) the Deferred
Cash Awards shall be made within five Business Days following the Closing
Date; _provided_ , that such payments may be made at such other time or times
following the Effective Time consistent with the terms of the 2018 Cash Award
or Deferred Cash Award, as applicable, to the extent necessary, as determined
by Parent, to avoid the imposition of additional tax under Section 409A of the
Code.

(f) Nothing in this _Section 6.07_ shall be deemed to (i) amend any Parent
Benefit Plan or to require Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any of their
Affiliates to continue or amend any particular benefit plan before or after
the consummation of the transactions contemplated in this Agreement, and any
such plan may be amended or terminated in accordance with its terms and
Applicable Law, (ii) guarantee employment for any period of time for, or
preclude the ability of Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any of their
respective Affiliates to terminate the employment of, any Continuing Employee
for any reason, (iii) constitute the establishment or amendment of any benefit
or compensation plan, policy, agreement or other arrangement on the part of
Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any of their Affiliates or (iv) create
any third party beneficiary rights in any Continuing Employee, any other
employee, officer, director, independent contractor of Parent, the Surviving
Corporation or any of their respective Affiliates, or any other Person.

  



  

Section 6.08 _State Takeover Laws_. If any "control share acquisition,"
"fair price," "moratorium" or other anti-takeover Applicable Law becomes or is
deemed to be applicable to the Company, Parent, Merger Sub, the Merger or any
other transaction contemplated by this Agreement, then each of the Company,
Parent, Merger Sub, and their respective Boards of Directors shall grant such
approvals and take such actions within their respective authority as are
necessary so that the transactions contemplated by this Agreement may be
consummated as promptly as practicable on the terms contemplated by this
Agreement and otherwise act to render such anti-takeover Applicable Law
inapplicable to the foregoing. _Section 6.09 Obligations of Merger Sub_.
Subject to the terms and conditions set forth herein, Parent shall cause
Merger Sub to perform its obligations under this Agreement and to consummate
the Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby on the terms and
conditions set forth in this Agreement.

  



  

Section 6.10 _Voting of Shares_. Parent shall vote any shares of Company
Common Stock beneficially owned by it or any of its Subsidiaries in favor of
adoption of this Agreement at the Stockholder Meeting, and will vote or cause
to be voted the shares of Merger Sub held by it or any of its Subsidiaries, as
the case may be, in favor of adoption of this Agreement immediately following
the execution of this Agreement and shall provide a copy of the certified vote
or written consent to the Company.

Section 6.11 _Director and Officer Indemnification, Exculpation and
Insurance_.

  



  

(a) For six years after the Effective Time, Parent shall, or shall cause
the Surviving Corporation to, maintain officers' and directors' liability
insurance in respect of acts or omissions occurring prior to the Effective
Time covering each such person currently covered by the Company's officers'
and directors' liability insurance policy on terms with respect to coverage
and amount no less favorable than those of such policy in effect on the date
hereof; _provided_ , _however_ , that in satisfying its obligation under this
_Section 6.11(a)_ , neither Parent nor the Surviving Corporation shall be
obligated to pay annual premiums in excess of 300% of the amount paid or
payable by the Company for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2019 (the "
**Current Premium** ") and if such premiums for such insurance would at any
time exceed 300% of the Current Premium, then the Surviving Corporation shall
cause to be maintained policies of insurance that, in the Surviving
Corporation's good faith judgment, provide the maximum coverage available at
an annual premium equal to 300% of the Current Premium. The provisions of the
immediately preceding sentence shall be deemed to have been satisfied if
prepaid "tail" or "runoff" policies have been obtained by the Company prior to
the Effective Time, which policies provide such persons currently covered by
such policies with coverage for an aggregate period of six years with respect
to claims arising from facts or events that occurred on or before the
Effective Time, including in respect of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement; _provided_ , _however_ , that the amount paid for such prepaid
policies does not exceed 300% of the Current Premium. If any such prepaid
policies described in this _Section 6.11(a)_ have been obtained by the Company
prior to the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall (and Parent shall
cause the Surviving Corporation to) maintain any and all such policies in full
force and effect for their full term, and continue to honor the obligations
thereunder.

  



  

(b) From and after the Effective Time, each of Parent and the Surviving
Corporation shall fulfill and honor in all respects the obligations of the
Company pursuant to: (i) each indemnification agreement in effect as of the
date hereof between the Company and each individual who (x) at the Effective
Time is, or at any time prior to the Effective Time was, a director or officer
of the Company or of a Subsidiary of the Company or (y) is listed on _Part
6.11(b)_ of the Company Disclosure Schedule (each such individual in clause
(x) or (y), an " **Indemnified Party** "), the form of which has been Made
Available to Parent; and (ii) any indemnification provision (including
advancement of expenses subject to the undertaking in this _Section 6.11_ to
repay advanced amounts) and any exculpation provision set forth in the
certificate of incorporation or bylaws of the Company as in effect on the date
hereof. Parent's and the Surviving Corporation's obligations under the
foregoing clauses (i) and (ii) shall continue in full force and effect for a
period of six years from the Effective Time; _provided_ , _however_ , that all
rights to indemnification, exculpation and advancement of expenses in respect
of any claim asserted or made within such period shall continue until the
final disposition of such claim.

  



  

(c) If Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any of its successors or
assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any other Person and shall not be
the continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation or
merger or (ii) transfers or conveys all or substantially all of its properties
and assets to any Person, then, and in each such case, proper provision shall
be made so that the successors and assigns of Parent or the Surviving
Corporation, as the case may be, shall assume the obligations set forth in
this _Section 6.11_.

  



  

 

 

 

69

   

 



 

 

 

  



  

(d) The provisions of this _Section 6.11_ are (i) intended to be for the
benefit of, and shall be enforceable by, each Indemnified Party, his or her
heirs and his or her Representatives and (ii) in addition to, and not in
substitution for, any other rights to indemnification or contribution that any
such individual may have under any certificate of incorporation or bylaws, by
contract or otherwise. The obligations of Parent and the Surviving Corporation
under this _Section 6.11_ shall not be terminated or modified in such a manner
as to adversely affect the rights of any Indemnified Party unless (x) such
termination or modification is required by Applicable Law or (y) the affected
Indemnified Party shall have consented in writing to such termination or
modification (it being expressly agreed that the Indemnified Parties shall be
intended third party beneficiaries of this _Section 6.11_ ); _provided_ ,
_however_ , that such rights of the Indemnified Parties as third party
beneficiaries under this _Section 6.11_ shall not arise until the Effective
Time.

pursuant to the NISPOM and applicable national or industrial security
regulations, and take such actions necessary to secure approval from or an
agreement with DCSA to mitigate foreign ownership, control and influence ("
**FOCI** "); (ii) promptly make all filings, and use reasonable best efforts

reasonable actions and steps requested or required by any Governmental
Authority as a condition to granting any consent, permit, authorization,

jurisdiction for which consents, permits, authorizations, waivers, clearances,
approvals and expirations or terminations of waiting periods are required with
respect to the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement; _provided_ that the Company and its Subsidiaries will only be
required to take or commit to take any such action, or agree to any such
condition or restriction, if such action, commitment, agreement, condition or
restriction is binding on the Company or its Subsidiaries, only in the event
the Closing occurs. Parent or its Affiliates shall pay all filing fees under
the HSR Act, other applicable Antitrust Laws and the DPA, and the Company
shall not be required to pay any fees or other payments to any Governmental
Authority in connection with any filings under the HSR Act, the DPA or such

conduct its day to day dealings with the FCC, PUCs and any other Governmental
Authority concerning its regulated activities, apart from the applicability of
the Antitrust Laws to the Merger.

(b) Parent shall, at the Closing (or, if earlier, upon termination of this

extent arising from (i) information furnished in writing by or on behalf of
the Company or its Subsidiaries, including historical financial statements and
financial statements prior to the Closing Date, or (ii) the willful
misconduct, gross negligence, fraud or intentional misrepresentation of the
Company, its Subsidiaries or their respective Representatives and Affiliates.

in a manner that is not intended to or reasonably likely to harm or disparage
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or the reputation or goodwill of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries and (y) are used solely in connection with
a description of the Company, its business and products or the Merger
(including in connection with any marketing materials related to the Debt

delay the Closing, in each case without the prior written consent of the
Company; _provided_ , _however_ , that, for the avoidance of doubt, Parent and
Merger Sub each may, without the consent of the Company, amend the Debt
Financing Commitment Letter to add lenders, arrangers, bookrunners,
syndication agents, or similar entities and to grant to such persons such
approval rights as are customarily granted to additional lenders, arrangers,
bookrunners, syndication agents or similar entities.

(ii) if at any time Parent becomes aware of any reason all or any portion of
the Debt Financing would reasonably be expected not to be obtained by the
Company, and (iii) any material adverse change with respect to the Debt
Financing; _provided_ , that in no event will Parent be under any obligation
to disclose any information pursuant to this _Section 6.17(e)_ that is subject
to attorney client or similar privilege. Parent acknowledges and agrees that,
obtaining the Debt Financing is not a condition to the Merger, payment of the
Aggregate Merger Consideration or the Closing and the obligations of Parent to
consummate the Closing in accordance with the terms hereof shall not be
conditioned on, or delayed or postponed as a result of the obtaining of (or
the failure to obtain) the Debt Financing.

  



  

(f) In the event (x) Parent or Merger Sub elect to obtain commitments in
respect of a Long Term Facility (as defined in the Debt Financing Commitment)
or other replacement Debt Financing or (y) all or any portion of the Debt
Financing expires, terminates or becomes unavailable, Parent and Merger Sub
shall use reasonable best efforts to obtain in replacement thereof alternative
financing from alternative sources (clauses (x) and/or (y), as applicable, the
" **Alternative Debt Financing** "), and in each case, any conditions
applicable to any Alternative Debt Financing, in respect of certainty of
funding and conditionality, shall either (x) be equivalent in all material
respects, taken as a whole, to (or more favorable to Parent and Merger Sub
than) the conditions set forth with respect to the Debt Financing as in effect
on the date hereof or (y) not reasonably be expected to prevent or materially
delay the Closing. Parent shall promptly deliver to the Company true and
complete copies of all agreements related to any such Alternative Debt
Financing following the execution thereof; _provided_ that fee amounts,

the Company (the " **Confidentiality Agreement** "), until the earlier of (a)
the Effective Time and (b) the termination of this Agreement in accordance
with its terms. All information provided by or on behalf of the Company or its
Subsidiaries pursuant to this Agreement (including in connection with the Debt
Financing) will be kept confidential in accordance with the Confidentiality
Agreement; _provided_ , _however_ , that, to the extent reasonably necessary
and customary to consummate the Debt Financing (including in connection with
any road shows, lender or investor meetings, rating agency meetings or other
similar marketing efforts), Parent and Merger Sub will be permitted to
disclose such information to any bona fide financing sources or prospective
financing sources that may become parties to the Debt Financing (and, in each
case, to their respective counsel and auditors) so long as each such Person
(x) agrees for the benefit of the Company to be bound by the obligations and
agreements of Macquarie Capital (USA) Inc. under the Confidentiality Agreement
to the same extent Parent and Merger Sub are bound hereby or (y) is subject to
other reasonable confidentiality undertakings customary for the syndicated
loan market that are reasonably acceptable to the Company and of which the
Company is an intended third-party beneficiary.

  



  

Section 6.19 _Director Resignations_. Prior to the Closing, the Company

distribution with respect to any of its capital stock.

  



  

Section 6.21 _Stock Market De-Listing_. Prior to the Effective Time, the

such action as may be necessary to cause the Company's securities to be de-
listed from Nasdaq and de-registered under the Exchange Act as soon as
practicable following the Effective Time.

  



  

Section 6.22 _Special Security Subsidiary_.

  



  

(a) The Company shall create a new wholly-owned Subsidiary (the "
**Special Security Subsidiary** "), and Parent and the Company shall each use
reasonable best efforts and take any and all action required by DCSA to
mitigate foreign ownership, control, or influence, and to maintain security
clearances. Such actions shall include: (i) taking measures necessary to
effectuate the transfer of any contracts held by the Company that involve
classified information or require access to classified facilities or the
provision of classified services to the Special Security Subsidiary or the
entity with the required facility security clearance under the National
Industrial Security Program that may be identified by the Parent; (ii) causing
the Special Security Subsidiary to obtain a facility security clearance under
the National Industrial Security Program; (iii) causing the Special Security
Subsidiary to undertake any permanent or interim mitigation measures required
by DCSA to address FOCI at the Special Security Subsidiary; and (iv) taking
such actions as are reasonably necessary to cause the Special Security
Subsidiary to comply with the requirements of such facility security clearance
and permanent or interim mitigation measures, in each case to be effective on
or before the Closing Date. Parent and Merger Sub shall cause the Persons in
their ownership structures, to the extent required by DCSA, to execute and
deliver such customary resolutions and other documents as may be required by
DCSA acknowledging their exclusion under such mitigation measures. Nothing
contained herein is intended to modify the obligations of the Parent and its
Affiliates under _Section 6.12_.

  



  

 

 

 

78

   

 



 

 

 

  



  

(b) If Parent and Company reasonably determine that, notwithstanding their
reasonable best efforts, it is not practically possible to mitigate the
foreign ownership, control or influence to the satisfaction of DCSA and to
maintain security clearances, Parent and the Company shall cooperate in good
faith to amend or replace the Classified Contracts prior to Closing such that
no contract held by the Company involves classified information or requires
any employee of the Company to hold any security clearance.

Authorization), _Section 4.05_ (Capitalization) (other than clause (a)
thereof) and _Section 4.23_ (Brokers' Fees) shall have been true and correct

representations and warranties of the Company set forth in clause (a) of
_Section 4.05_ (Capitalization) shall be true and correct in all respects
other than de minimis inaccuracies therein, (iii) the representations and

on the Closing Date as if made on the Closing Date (except to the extent that

in which case such representation and warranty shall be true and correct only
as of such earlier date); _provided_ , _however_ , that notwithstanding
anything in this Agreement to the contrary, the condition set forth in this
clause (a)(iv) shall be deemed to have been satisfied even if any
representations and warranties of the Company are not so true and correct if
the failure of such representations and warranties of the Company to be so
true and correct, individually or in the aggregate, have not resulted in a
Company Material Adverse Effect;

  



  

(b) the Company shall have performed or complied in all material respects
with all covenants and obligations required to be performed or complied with
by it under this Agreement at or prior to the Closing;

following conditions:

  



  

(a) the representations and warranties of Parent and Merger Sub set forth
in _Article 5_ of this Agreement shall be true and correct in all material
respects on the Closing Date as if made on the Closing Date (except to the

the failure of such representations and warranties to be so true and correct
in all material respects as of such particular date (disregarding all
qualifications or limitations as to "materiality," "Parent Material Adverse
Effect" or words of similar import) would not have a Parent Material Adverse
Effect;

  



  

(b) Parent and Merger Sub shall each have performed or complied in all
material respects with all covenants and obligations required to be performed
or complied with by it under this Agreement at or prior to the Closing; and

  



  

(c) the Company shall have received at the Closing a certificate signed on
behalf of Parent by the Chief Executive Officer or the Chief Financial Officer
of Parent certifying that the conditions set forth in _Section 7.03(a)_ and
_Section 7.03(b)_ have been satisfied.

_Section 7.03_ , as the case may be, to be satisfied (or to be able to be
satisfied) to excuse it from its obligation to effect the Merger if such

comply with or perform its obligations under this Agreement.

the Company would be entitled to terminate this Agreement pursuant to _Section
8.01(f)_ ;

  



  

(f) by the Company, upon written notice to Parent, in the event of a

(h) by the Company, upon written notice to Parent, prior to the

(including _Section 6.02_ and _Section 6.03_ ), if the Company Board shall
have effected an Adverse Recommendation Change in respect of a Superior
Proposal in accordance with _Section 6.03_ , and concurrently with such

respect to such Superior Proposal; _provided_ , _however_ , that the Company
shall prior to or substantially concurrently with, and as a condition of, such
termination, pay the Company Termination Fee to Parent pursuant to _Section
9.04_ ; or

  



  

 

 

 

82

   

 



 

 

 

  



  

(i) by the Company, upon written notice to Parent, if (A) the conditions
set forth in _Section 7.01_ and _Section 7.02_ (other than those conditions

losses or damages suffered or incurred by the Company in connection with this
Agreement (and the termination hereof), the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement (and the abandonment thereof) or any matter forming the basis for
such termination, and except for payment of the Parent Termination Fee and the
obligations of Parent and Merger Sub pursuant to _Sections 6.17(b)_ and
_6.17(c)_ (collectively, the " **Parent Expenses** ") and any Company Recovery
Costs under and this _Section 9.04_ _(_ _c)_ , neither Parent nor Merger Sub
shall have any further liability, whether pursuant to a claim at law or in
equity, to the Company or any of its Affiliates under this Agreement (and the
termination hereof), the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (and the
abandonment thereof) or any matter forming the basis for such termination, and
the Company shall not be entitled to bring or maintain any Proceeding against
Parent and its Affiliates and any of their respective former, current or
future direct or indirect equity holders, general or limited partners,
controlling persons, stockholders, members, managers, directors, officers,
employees, agents, affiliates or assignees (collectively, the " **Parent
Related Parties** ") for damages or any equitable relief arising out of or in
connection with this Agreement, any of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement or any matters forming the basis for such termination (other than
equitable relief to require payment of the Parent Termination Fee and/or any
Parent Expenses); _provided_ that if Parent fails to pay the Parent
Termination Fee and/or any Parent Expenses and the Company commences a suit
which results in a final, non-appealable judgment against Parent for the
Parent Termination Fee and/or any Parent Expenses, or any portions thereof,
then Parent shall pay the Company its reasonable out of pocket costs and
expenses (including reasonable attorney's fees and disbursements) in
connection with such suit, together with interest on the Parent Termination
Fee and/or Parent Expenses at the "prime rate" as published in The Wall Street
Journal, Eastern Edition, in effect on the date such payment was required to

Section 9.09 _Specific Performance_.

  



  

(a) The parties hereto agree that irreparable harm would occur in the
event that any of the provisions of this Agreement were not performed in
accordance with their specific terms or were otherwise breached, and that
money damages or other legal remedies would not be an adequate remedy for any
such harm. It is accordingly agreed that, unless this Agreement is validly
terminated in accordance with _Section 8.01_ and any dispute over the right of
termination has been finally resolved, (i) the parties hereto shall be
entitled to an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement
and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions of this Agreement in a
court of competent jurisdiction as set forth in _Section 9.07_ and, in any
action for specific performance, each party waives any requirement for the
securing or posting of any bond in connection with such remedy, this being in
addition to any other remedy to which they are entitled at law or in equity
(subject to the limitations set forth in this Agreement), and (ii) the right
of specific enforcement is an integral part of the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement, including the Merger, and without that right, none of the
Company, Parent or Merger Sub would have entered into this Agreement.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement, the
parties hereto agree that until this Agreement is validly terminated in
accordance with _Section 8.01_ , the Company shall be entitled to an
injunction, specific performance or other equitable remedy requiring the
Equity Financing to be funded and to specifically enforce Parent's and Merger
Sub's obligations to effect the Closing on the terms and conditions set forth
herein if and only if (A) all of the conditions precedent to the Closing set
forth in _Section 7.01_ and _Section 7.02_ of this Agreement have been
satisfied or waived in accordance with the terms and conditions thereof at the
time the Closing should have occurred pursuant to _Section 2.01_ (other than
those conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied at the Closing), (B)
the Debt Financing Sources have confirmed in writing that the Debt Financing
has been funded or will be funded at the Closing if the Equity Financing is
funded, (C) the Company has irrevocably confirmed to Parent in writing that
all conditions set forth in _Section 7.03_ have been satisfied or waived and
the Company stands ready, willing and able to consummate the Merger, and (D)
Parent and Merger Sub fail to complete the Closing on the date the Closing is
required to have occurred pursuant to _Section 2.01_ (such clauses (A) through
(D), together, the " **Specific** **Performance Conditions** "); _provided_ ,
however, that if the Company receives a grant of specific performance pursuant
to this _Section 9.09_ and the Closing pursuant to _Section 2.01_ occurs, then
the Company will be deemed to have waived any and all rights to pursue and
recover all or any portion of the Parent Termination Fee pursuant to _Section
8.02_ and any other remedy as a matter of Applicable Law, Contract, tort,
equity or otherwise (for money damages or otherwise) upon such receipt of
specific performance, other than any expenses and costs incurred in enforcing
its rights under this Agreement. Each of the parties hereto agrees that it
will not oppose the granting of an injunction, specific performance or other
equitable relief on the basis that any other of such parties has an adequate
remedy at law or that any such injunction or award of specific performance or
other equitable relief is not an appropriate remedy for any reason.

(b) The parties hereto further agree that (i) by seeking the remedies
provided for in this _Section 9.09_ , a party shall not in any respect waive
its right to seek any other form of relief that may be available to a party
under this Agreement for breach of any of the provisions of this Agreement or
in the event that this Agreement has been terminated or in the event that the
remedies provided for in this _Section 9.09_ are not available or otherwise
are not granted, and (ii) nothing set forth in this _Section 9.09_ shall
require any party hereto to institute any Proceeding for (or limit any party's
right to institute any Proceeding for) specific performance under this
_Section 9.09_ prior or as a condition to exercising any termination right
under _Article 8_ , nor shall the commencement of any Proceeding pursuant to
this _Section 9.09_ or anything set forth in this _Section 9.09_ restrict or
limit any party's right to terminate this Agreement in accordance with the
terms of _Article 8_ or pursue any other remedies under this Agreement that
may be available at any time.

  



  

Section 9.10 _Severability_. If any term, provision, covenant or
restriction of this Agreement is held by a court of competent jurisdiction or
other Governmental Authority to be invalid, void or unenforceable, the
remainder of the terms, provisions, covenants and restrictions of this
Agreement shall remain in full force and effect and shall in no way be
affected, impaired or invalidated so long as the economic or legal substance
of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement is not affected in any
manner materially adverse to any party. Upon such a determination, the parties
hereto agree to negotiate in good faith to modify this Agreement so as to
effect the original intent of the parties hereto as closely as possible in an
acceptable manner, in order that the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement be consummated as originally contemplated to the fullest extent
possible.

  



  

Section 9.11 _Parent Guarantee_. Parent shall cause Merger Sub to comply
in all respects with each of the representations, warranties, covenants,
obligations, agreements and undertakings made or required to be performed by
Merger Sub in accordance with the terms of this Agreement, the Merger, and the
other transactions contemplated by this Agreement. As a material inducement to
the Company's willingness to enter into this Agreement and perform its
obligations hereunder, Parent hereby unconditionally guarantees full
performance and payment by Merger Sub of each of the covenants, obligations
and undertakings required to be performed by Merger Sub under this Agreement
and the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, subject to all terms,
conditions and limitations contained in this Agreement, and hereby represents,
acknowledges and agrees that any such breach of any such representation and
warranty or default in the performance of any such covenant, obligation,
agreement or undertaking of Merger Sub shall also be deemed to be a breach or
default of Parent, and, subject to the terms and limitations of this
Agreement, the Company shall have the right, exercisable in its sole
discretion, to pursue any and all available remedies it may have arising out
of any such breach or nonperformance directly against either or both of Parent
and Merger Sub in the first instance. As applicable, references in this
_Section 9.11_ to "Merger Sub" shall also include the Surviving Corporation
following the Effective Time.

Section 9.12 _Entire Agreement; No Reliance; Access to Information_.

  



  

(a) This Agreement, the Confidentiality Agreement, the exhibits and
schedules to this Agreement, the Company Disclosure Schedule, the Financing
Commitment Letters and the Guarantees constitute the entire agreement among
the parties with respect to the subject matter hereof and supersede all prior
agreements and understandings, both written and oral, among the parties with
respect thereto.

  



  

(b) The Company, Parent and Merger Sub agree that, except for the
representations and warranties contained in _Article 4_ and _Article 5_ of
this Agreement, neither the Company, Parent, nor Merger Sub makes any other
representations or warranties and each hereby disclaims any other
representations or warranties made by itself or any of its Representatives,
with respect to the execution and delivery of this Agreement or the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, notwithstanding the delivery or
disclosure to any other party or any other party's Representatives of any
document or other information with respect to any one or more of the
foregoing. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, and except as
expressly set forth as representations and warranties made by the parties in
this Agreement, each of Parent and Merger Sub agrees that none of the Company
or any of its Subsidiaries make or has made any representation or warranty
with respect to (i) any projections, forecasts, estimates, plans or budgets or
future revenues, expenses or expenditures, future results of operations (or
any component thereof), future cash flows (or any component thereof) or future
financial condition (or any component thereof) of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries or the future business, operations or affairs of the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries heretofore or hereafter delivered to or made available
to it, or (ii) any other information, statements or documents heretofore or
hereafter delivered to or made available to it, including the information in
the electronic data room of the Company, with respect to the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries or the business, operations or affairs of the Company or any
of its Subsidiaries, except to the extent and as expressly covered by a
representation and warranty made in _Article 4_ of this Agreement.

  



  

(c) Parent and Merger Sub each acknowledges and agrees that it (i) has had
an opportunity to discuss the business of the Company and its Subsidiaries
with the management of the Company, (ii) has had reasonable access to (A) the
books and records of the Company and its Subsidiaries and (B) the documents
provided by the Company for purposes of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, (iii) has been afforded reasonable opportunity to ask questions of
and received answers from officers of the Company and (iv) has conducted its
own independent investigation of the Company and its Subsidiaries, their
respective businesses and the transactions contemplated hereby, and has not
relied on any representation, warranty or other statement by any Person on
behalf of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, other than the
representations and warranties of the Company contained in _Article 4_ of this
Agreement. Each of Parent and Merger Sub hereby acknowledges that there are
uncertainties inherent in attempting to develop estimates, projections,
forecasts, business plans and other forward-looking information with which
Parent and Merger Sub are familiar, that Parent and Merger Sub are taking full
responsibility for making their own evaluation of the adequacy and accuracy of
all estimates, projections, forecasts, business plans and other forward-
looking information furnished to them (including the reasonableness of the
assumptions underlying such estimates, projections, forecasts, business plans
and other forward-looking information), and, for the avoidance of doubt, that
Parent and Merger Sub will have no claim against the Company or any of its
stockholders, directors, officers, employees, Affiliates, advisors, agents or
other Representatives with respect thereto, except to the extent and as
expressly covered by a representation and warranty made in _Article 4_ of this
Agreement.

Section 9.13 _No Presumption Against Drafting Party_. Each of the parties
hereto acknowledges that it has been represented by counsel of its choice
throughout all negotiations that have preceded the execution of this Agreement
and that it has executed the same with the advice of said independent counsel.
Each party and its counsel cooperated and participated in the drafting and
preparation of this Agreement and the documents referred to herein, and any
and all drafts relating thereto exchanged among the parties shall be deemed
the work product of all of the parties and may not be construed against any
party by reason of its drafting or preparation. Accordingly, any rule of law
or any legal decision that would require interpretation of any ambiguities in
this Agreement against any party that drafted or prepared it is of no
application and is hereby expressly waived by each of the parties hereto, and
any controversy over interpretations of this Agreement shall be decided
without regard to events of drafting or preparation.

  



  

Section 9.14 _Counterparts; Effectiveness_. This Agreement may be signed
in any number of counterparts, each of which shall be an original, with the
same effect as if the signatures thereto and hereto were upon the same
instrument. This Agreement shall become effective when each party hereto shall
have received a counterpart hereof signed by all of the other parties hereto.
Until and unless each party has received a counterpart hereof signed by each
other party hereto, this Agreement shall have no effect and no party shall
have any right or obligation hereunder (whether by virtue of any other oral or
written agreement or other communication). Signatures to this Agreement
transmitted by facsimile transmission, by electronic mail in PDF form, or by
any other electronic means designed to preserve the original graphic and
pictorial appearance of a document, will be deemed to have the same effect as

permitted to bring any claim against a Debt Financing Source for failing to
satisfy any obligation to fund the Debt Financing pursuant to the terms of the
Debt Financing Commitment Letter or any documentation with respect to an
Alternative Debt Financing, (g) no amendment or waiver of this _Section 9.15_
that is adverse to the Debt Financing Sources shall be effective without the

the Debt Financing Commitment Letter or of Merger Sub, Parent, the Company or
their respective Affiliates under the definitive financing agreements executed

extent such Person is or becomes a party thereto or the liabilities or
obligations of the Debt Financing Sources under the Existing Credit Agreement,
the Debt Financing Commitment Letter or the definitive financing agreements

right to seek specific performance to the extent permitted by and in
accordance with _Section 9.09_ , and recourse against the Guarantors under the
Guarantees to the extent provided therein, any claim or cause of action under
