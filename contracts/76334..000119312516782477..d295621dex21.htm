(a) Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement
and in accordance with the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware
(the " _DGCL_ "), at the Effective Time, Merger Sub shall be merged with and

and the Company shall continue its existence under Delaware law as
the surviving corporation in the Merger (the " _Surviving Corporation_ ") and
a wholly owned Subsidiary of Parent.

(b) The Merger shall have the effects set forth in this Agreement and the
applicable provisions of the DGCL. Without limiting the generality of the
foregoing and subject thereto, at the Effective Time, all the property,
rights, privileges, immunities, powers and franchises of the Company and
Merger Sub shall vest in the Surviving Corporation and all debts, liabilities
and duties of the Company and Merger Sub shall become the debts, liabilities
and duties of the Surviving Corporation, all as provided under the DGCL and
other applicable Law.

Section 1.2 _Closing_. The closing of the Merger (the " _Closing_ ") shall
take place at 10:00 a.m., local time, on the third Business Day after the
satisfaction or, to the extent permitted by applicable Law, waiver of the
conditions set forth in Article VII (other than those conditions that, by
their nature or terms, are to be satisfied at Closing, but subject to the
satisfaction or, to the extent permitted by applicable Law, waiver of such
conditions), at the offices of Bass, Berry and Sims, 150 Third Avenue South,
Suite 2800, Nashville, TN, unless another time, date or place is agreed to in
writing by the parties. The date on which the Closing actually occurs is
hereinafter referred to as the " _Closing Date_."

 

Section 1.3 _Effective Time_. Immediately following the Closing on the Closing
Date, the parties shall cause a certificate of merger relating to the Merger
(the " _Certificate of Merger_ ") to be filed with the Secretary of State of
the State of Delaware, in such form as required by, and executed and
acknowledged in accordance with, the applicable provisions of the DGCL. The
Merger shall become effective at the time when the Certificate of Merger has
been duly filed with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware or at
such later time as the parties shall agree and specify in the Certificate of
Merger in accordance with the relevant provisions of the DGCL (such time is
hereinafter referred to as the " _Effective Time_ ").

 

Section 1.4 _Certificate of Incorporation_. At the Effective Time, the
certificate of incorporation of the Surviving Corporation shall be amended in
its entirety to read as set forth on Exhibit A hereto, until thereafter
changed or amended as provided by the DGCL or therein, subject to Section
6.8(c).

 

Section 1.5 _Bylaws_. Subject to Section 6.8(c), at the Effective Time, the
bylaws of the Company as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time
shall be the bylaws of the Surviving Corporation, until thereafter changed or
amended as provided by the DGCL, the certificate of incorporation of the
Surviving Corporation and such bylaws.

 



2 Section 1.6 _Board of Directors_. The parties shall take, or cause to be
taken, all actions reasonably necessary so that the directors of Merger Sub
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be the initial directors of the
Surviving Corporation from and after the Effective Time, until the earlier of
their death, resignation or removal or until their respective successors are
duly elected and qualified.

Section 1.7 _Officers_. Except as otherwise determined by Parent prior to the
Effective Time, the officers of the Company immediately prior to the Effective
Time shall be the initial officers of the Surviving Corporation from and after
the Effective Time, until the earlier of their death, resignation or removal
or until their respective successors are duly appointed and qualified.

by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of the holder
thereof, shall cease to be outstanding and shall be cancelled and retired and
shall cease to exist, and no consideration shall be delivered in exchange
therefor.

 

(b) Subject to Section 2.1(a), Section 2.2 and Section 2.3, each share of
Company Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time (including any shares of Company Common Stock held in a Company
Benefit Plan or related trust) shall be converted into and shall thereafter
represent the right to receive an amount in cash equal to $83.00, without
interest (the " _Merger Consideration_ "). As of the Effective Time, all such
shares of Company Common Stock shall cease to be outstanding, shall be
automatically cancelled and shall cease to exist, and each holder of
a certificate representing any such shares of Company Common Stock (a "
_Certificate_ ") or shares of Company Common Stock held in book-entry form ("
_Book-Entry Shares_ ") shall cease to have any rights with respect
thereto, except the right to receive, in accordance with this Section 2.1(b),
the Merger Consideration, upon surrender of such Certificate or cancellation
of such Book-Entry Shares, without interest.

 

(c) Each share of common stock of Merger Sub issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time, without any action on the part
of the holder thereof, shall be converted into one share of common stock of
the Surviving Corporation.

Section 2.2 _Certain Adjustments_. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement
to the contrary, if, from the date of this Agreement until the Effective Time,
the outstanding shares of Company Common Stock shall have been changed into a
different number of shares or a different class by reason of any
reclassification, stock split (including a reverse stock split),

 



3  recapitalization, split-up, combination, subdivision, exchange of shares,
readjustment, or other similar transaction, or a stock dividend or stock
distribution thereon shall be declared with a record date within said period,
the Merger Consideration and any other similarly dependent items, as the case
may be, shall be equitably adjusted to provide the holders of Company Common
Stock the same economic effect as contemplated by this Agreement prior to
such event.

Section 2.3 _Dissenting Shares_. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to
the contrary, shares (" _Appraisal Shares_ ") of Company Common Stock that
are issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time and that
are held by any Person who is entitled to demand and properly demands
appraisal of such Appraisal Shares pursuant to, and who complies in all
respects with, Section 262 of the DGCL (" _Section 262_ ") shall not be
converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration as provided in
Section 2.1(b), but rather the holders of Appraisal Shares shall be entitled
to payment by the Surviving Corporation of the "fair value" of such Appraisal
Shares in accordance with and to the extent provided in Section 262;
_provided_ , _however_ , that if any such holder shall fail to perfect or
otherwise shall waive, withdraw or lose the right to appraisal under Section
262 with respect to Appraisal Shares, then the right of such holder to seek
appraisal of such shares of Company Common Stock shall cease and such shares
of Company Common Stock shall be deemed to have been converted as of the
Effective Time into, and to have become exchangeable solely for, the right to
receive the Merger Consideration as provided in Section 2.1(b), without
interest. The Company shall give prompt notice, and in any event within 48
hours of receipt, to Parent of any demands received by the Company for
appraisal of any shares of Company Common Stock, and Parent shall participate
in and control all negotiations and Proceedings with respect to such demands.
Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall not, without the prior written
consent of Parent, make any payment with respect to, or settle or offer to
settle, any such demands, or agree to do any of the foregoing.

Section 2.4 _Exchange of Company Common Stock_.

 

(a) _Paying Agent_. Prior to the Effective Time, Parent and Merger Sub shall
deposit or cause to be deposited with a financial institution or trust
company selected by Parent with the Companys prior approval (which approval
shall not be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned) (the " _Paying
Agent_ "), for the benefit of the holders of shares of Company Common Stock,
for exchange in accordance with this Article II, through the Paying Agent, all
of the cash sufficient to pay the aggregate Merger Consideration (such cash
provided to the Paying Agent being hereinafter referred to as the " _Exchange
Fund_ "). Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall cause the Paying Agent to
deliver the cash contemplated to be paid pursuant to Section 2.1 out of the
Exchange Fund. The Exchange Fund shall not be used for any other purpose.
Parent shall or shall cause the Surviving Corporation to promptly replace or
restore the cash in the Exchange Fund so as to ensure that the Exchange Fund
is at all times maintained at a level sufficient for the Paying Agent to make
such payments under Section 2.1(b). Nothing contained in this Section 2.4(a)
and no investment losses resulting from investment of the funds deposited with
the Paying Agent shall diminish the rights of any holder of Company Common
Stock to receive the Merger Consideration. The paying agent agreement
pursuant to which Parent shall appoint the Paying Agent shall be in form and
substance reasonably acceptable to the Company.

 



4 (b) _Exchange Procedures_.

 

(i) _Certificates_. Parent shall instruct the Paying Agent to mail (or in the
case of The Depository Trust Company on behalf of "street" holders, deliver),
as soon as reasonably practicable (but no later than three Business Days)
following the Effective Time, to each holder of record of a Certificate whose
shares were converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration
pursuant to Section 2.1(b), (i) a letter of transmittal (which shall be in
such form and have such other provisions as the Company and Parent shall
mutually agree and shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of
loss and title to the Certificates shall pass, only upon delivery of the
Certificates to the Paying Agent) and (ii) instructions for use in effecting
the surrender of the Certificates in exchange for the Merger Consideration.
Upon surrender of a Certificate for cancellation to the Paying Agent,
together with such letter of transmittal, duly executed, and such other
documents as may reasonably be required by Parent or the Paying Agent, the
holder of such Certificate shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor,
and Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall cause the Paying Agent to pay
and deliver in exchange thereof as promptly as practicable, the cash amount
equal to (x) the number of shares of Company Common Stock represented by such
Certificate multiplied by (y) the Merger Consideration, and the Certificate so
surrendered shall forthwith be cancelled. In the event of a transfer of
ownership of Company Common Stock that is not registered in the transfer
records of the Company, payment may be made to a Person other than the Person
in whose name the Certificate so surrendered is registered, if such
Certificate shall be properly endorsed or otherwise be in proper form for
transfer and the Person requesting such payment shall pay any transfer or
other taxes required by reason of the payment to a Person other than the
registered holder of such Certificate or establish to the satisfaction of
Parent that such tax has been paid or is not applicable. Subject to Section
2.3, until surrendered as contemplated by this Section 2.4, each Certificate
shall be deemed at any time after the Effective Time to represent only the
right to receive upon such surrender the Merger Consideration into which the
shares of Company Common Stock theretofore represented by such Certificate
have been converted into pursuant to Section 2.1(b). No interest shall be paid
or accrue on any cash payable upon surrender of any Certificate.

(ii) _Book-Entry Shares_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained
in this Agreement, any holder of Book-Entry Shares shall not be required to
deliver a Certificate to the Paying Agent to receive the Merger Consideration
that such holder is entitled to receive pursuant to this Article II. Parent
shall instruct the Paying Agent to mail, as soon as reasonably practicable
(but no later than three Business Days) following the Effective Time, to each
holder of record of one or more Book-Entry Shares whose shares were converted
into the right to receive the Merger Consideration pursuant to Section
2.1(b), (i) a letter of transmittal (which shall be in such form and have such
other provisions as the Company and Parent shall mutually agree) and (ii)
instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the Book-Entry Shares in
exchange for the Merger Consideration. Upon delivery of such letter of
transmittal to the Paying Agent, duly executed, and such other documents as
may reasonably be required by Parent or the Paying Agent, each holder of
record of one or more Book-Entry Shares whose shares of Company Common Stock
were converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration pursuant to
Section 2.1(b) shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor, and Parent
and the Surviving Corporation shall cause the Paying Agent to pay and deliver
in exchange thereof as promptly as practicable, the cash amount equal to (x)
the number of shares of Company Common Stock represented by such Book-Entry
Shares multiplied by (y) the Merger Consideration.

 



5 (c) _No Further Ownership Rights in Company Common Stock; Closing of Transfer
Books_. The Merger Consideration paid in accordance with the terms of this
Article II shall be deemed to have been paid in full satisfaction of all
rights pertaining to such shares of Company Common Stock (other than the right
to receive the payments contemplated by this Article II). After the Effective
Time, there shall be no further registration of transfers on the stock
transfer books of the Surviving Corporation of shares of Company Common Stock
that were outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time. If, after the
Effective Time, any Certificates formerly representing shares of Company
Common Stock are presented to the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent
for any reason, they shall be cancelled and exchanged as provided in this
Article II.

(d) _Termination of Exchange Fund_. Any portion of the Exchange Fund that
remains undistributed to the holders of Company Common Stock for six months
after the Effective Time shall be delivered to the Surviving Corporation, upon
demand, and any holder of Company Common Stock who has not theretofore
complied with this Article II shall thereafter look only to Parent and the
Surviving Corporation (subject to Section 2.4(e)) for payment of its claim for
the Merger Consideration.

(e) _No Liability_. None of Parent, Merger Sub, the Surviving Corporation,
the Paying Agent or any other Person shall be liable to any Person in respect
of any cash from the Exchange Fund (including any amounts delivered to Parent
in accordance with Section 2.4(d)) properly delivered to a public official
pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar Law.

(f)  _Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates_. In the event any Certificate
shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of
that fact by the Person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or
destroyed and, to the extent reasonably required by Parent, the posting by
such Person of a bond in reasonable amount as indemnity against any claim that
may be made against it with respect to such Certificate, the Paying Agent
shall pay in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate the
Merger Consideration that would be payable in respect thereof pursuant to this
Agreement had such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate been surrendered as
provided in this Article II.

 

(g) _Investment_. The Paying Agent shall invest the Exchange Fund, as directed
by Parent; _provided_ , _however_ , that such investments shall be in (i)
obligations of, or guaranteed by, the United States of America and backed by
the full faith and credit of the United States of America, (ii) commercial
paper obligations of issuers organized under the Laws of a state of the
United States of America rated A-1 or P-1 or better by Moodys Investors
Service, Inc. or Standard and Poors Corporation, respectively, (iii)
certificates of deposit, bank repurchase agreements or bankers acceptances
of commercial banks with capital exceeding $10,000,000,000 (based on the most
recent financial statements of such bank which are then publicly available) or
(iv) a combination of the foregoing. Any interest and other income resulting
from such investments shall be the property of and paid to the Surviving
Corporation; _provided_ that no losses on any investment made pursuant to this
Section 2.4(g) shall affect the 

 



6  Merger Consideration payable to holders of Company Common Stock entitled to
receive such consideration, and following any such losses, Parent and the
Surviving Corporation shall promptly cause to be provided additional funds to
the Paying Agent for the benefit of holders of shares of Company Common Stock
entitled to receive such consideration in the amount of any such losses or if
for any reason such funds are unavailable for payment to the holders of
shares of Company Common Stock.

(h) _Withholdings_. Each of Parent, the Surviving Corporation and the Paying
Agent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the consideration
otherwise payable to any Person pursuant to this Article II such amounts as it
is required to deduct and withhold with respect to the making of such payment
under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the " _Code_ ") or under
any provision of state, local or foreign tax Law. Any amount properly deducted
or withheld pursuant to this Section 2.4(h) shall be treated for all purposes
of this Agreement as having been paid to the Person in respect of which such
deduction or withholding was made. Parent shall pay, or shall cause to be
paid, all amounts so deducted or withheld to the appropriate Taxing Authority
within the period required under applicable Law. 

Section 2.5 _Treatment of Company Stock Plans_.

 

(a) _Treatment of Options_. At the Effective Time, each option granted by the
Company to purchase shares of Company Common Stock that is outstanding as of
immediately prior to the Effective Time, whether vested or unvested (any such
option, a " _Company Option_ "), shall be cancelled and shall entitle the
holder to receive, as soon as reasonably practicable (but no later than the
next regularly scheduled payroll date that occurs no less than five Business
Days after the Closing Date) following the Effective Time, a cash payment
(without interest and subject to applicable withholding Taxes) from the
Surviving Corporation with respect thereto equal to the product of (i) the
total number of shares of Company Common Stock subject to such Company Option
as of immediately prior to the Effective Time and (ii) the excess, if any, of
the Merger Consideration over the exercise price per share of Company Common
Stock subject to such Company Option as of immediately prior to the Effective
Time (the " _Option Payment_ "). For the avoidance of doubt, any Company
Option with an exercise price equal to or in excess of the Merger
Consideration shall be cancelled by virtue of the Merger without any action on
the part of the holder thereof and without any payment to the holder thereof.
As of the Effective Time, each holder of a Company Option shall cease to have
any rights with respect thereto except the right to receive the Option
Payment, if applicable.

(b)  _Company RSU Awards and Company PSU Awards_. At the Effective Time, each
time-vesting restricted stock unit award granted by the Company in respect of
shares of Company Common Stock (a " _Company RSU Award_ ") (including
any Company RSU Award that previously vested but receipt of which has been
deferred by the holder) and each performance based restricted stock unit award
granted by the Company in respect of shares of Company Common Stock (a "
_Company PSU Award_ ") that is outstanding as of immediately prior to the
Effective Time shall be cancelled and shall entitle the holder to receive, as
promptly as practicable (but no later than the next regularly scheduled
payroll date that occurs no less than five Business Days after the Closing
Date) following the Effective Time, a cash payment (without interest and
subject to applicable withholding Taxes) from the Surviving Corporation with
respect thereto equal to the product of (i) the total number of shares of
Company Common

 



7  Stock subject to such Company RSU Award or Company PSU Award as of
immediately prior to the Effective Time and (ii) the sum of (A) the Merger
Consideration plus (B) any cash dividend equivalents per share accrued but
unpaid immediately prior to the Effective Time with respect to such Company
RSU Award or Company PSU Award payable in accordance with the underlying award
agreement (the " _RSU/PSU Payment_ ");  _provided_ , _however_ , that to the
extent that any Company RSU Award or Company PSU Award constitutes
nonqualified deferred compensation subject to Section 409A of the Code, such
cash payment shall be paid in accordance with the applicable awards terms
and at the earliest time permitted under the terms of such award that will not
result in the application of a tax or penalty under Section 409A of the Code,
including payment in accordance with any applicable exception or permitted
payment event under Section 409A of the Code and Section 1.409A-3(j) of the
Treasury Regulations provided the use of such exception would not impact any
other deferred compensation arrangement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, each
holder of a Company RSU Award granted after the date of this Agreement (an "
_Interim RSU Award_ ") that is outstanding as of immediately prior to the
Effective Time shall not be entitled to receive an RSU/PSU Payment with
respect to the portion of such Interim RSU Award that is not vested as of
immediately prior to the Effective Time in accordance with the underlying
award agreement, so that the RSU/PSU Payment paid to such holder in respect of
an Interim RSU Award shall equal the product of (i) the total number of
shares of Company Common Stock subject to the vested portion of such Interim
RSU Award as of immediately prior to the Effective Time and (ii) the sum of
(A) the Merger Consideration plus (B) any cash dividend equivalents per share
accrued but unpaid immediately prior to the Effective Time with respect to the
vested portion of such Interim RSU Award immediately prior to the Effective
Time payable in accordance with the underlying award agreement. For the
avoidance of doubt, the unvested portion of all Interim RSU Awards will be
cancelled at the Effective Time without any action on the part of the holder
thereof and without any payment to the holder thereof. As of the Effective
Time, each holder of a Company RSU Award (including Interim RSU Awards) or a
Company PSU Award shall cease to have any rights with respect thereto except
the right to receive the RSU/PSU Payment as provided herein.

 

(c) _Company Actions_. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company, the Board of
Directors of the Company or the appropriate committee of the Board of
Directors of the Company, as applicable, shall adopt any resolutions and take
any actions which are reasonably necessary to effectuate the provisions of
this Section 2.5, including any participant notice requirements in
accordance with the terms of any Company Stock Plan or the ESPP. The Company
shall take all actions necessary to ensure that from and after the Effective
Time neither Parent nor the Surviving Corporation shall be required to deliver
shares of Company Common Stock or other capital stock of the Company to any
Person pursuant to, or in settlement of, the Company Stock Plans, ESPP,
Company Options, Company RSU Awards, Company PSU Awards or otherwise.

 

Section 2.6 _Treatment of Employee Stock Purchase Plan_. Prior to the
Effective Time, the Company, the Board of Directors of the Company or the
appropriate committee of the Board of Directors of the Company, as applicable,
shall adopt any resolutions and take any actions which are necessary to: (i)
terminate the Companys Employee Stock Purchase Plan (" _ESPP_ ") subject to,
and effective as of immediately prior to, the Effective Time, (ii) ensure that
no new offering period under the ESPP shall be commenced after the date of
this Agreement, (iii) prohibit participants in the ESPP from altering their
payroll deductions from those in effect on

 



8  the date of this Agreement (other than to discontinue their participation in
the ESPP in accordance with the terms and conditions of the ESPP), (iv) ensure
participant accounts are applied in accordance with the terms and conditions
of the ESPP to purchase shares of Company Common Stock prior to the Effective
Time and (v) provide that the amount of the accumulated contributions of each
participant in the ESPP as of immediately prior to the Effective Time shall,
to the extent not used to purchase shares of Company Common Stock in
accordance with the terms and conditions of the ESPP, be refunded to such
participant as soon as reasonably practicable following the Effective Time
(without interest) all in accordance with Section 19(b) of the ESPP. Any
shares of Company Common Stock purchased under the ESPP shall be treated in
accordance with Section 2.1(b).

forms, statements, certifications and other documents required to be filed or
furnished (as applicable) by the Company with the SEC pursuant to the Exchange
Act and the Securities Act since November 30, 2013 (collectively, and together
with such reports, schedules, forms, statements, certifications and other
documents filed with or furnished to the SEC subsequent to the date of this
Agreement, including any amendments thereto, the " _Company SEC Documents_ ").
As of their respective dates or, if amended, as of the date of the last such

with the applicable requirements of the Exchange Act, the Securities Act and
the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (the " _Sarbanes-Oxley Act_ "), and any rules
and regulations promulgated thereunder applicable to the Company SEC Documents
and (ii) did not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to
state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to
make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they
were made, not misleading. There are no outstanding or unresolved comments in
comment letters received by the Company from the SEC or its staff. There has
been no written comment letter or response between the SEC (and its staff)
and the Company between November 30, 2013 and the date of this Agreement that
is not available on the SECs Electronic Data Gathering Analysis and Retrieval
database.

 

(b) The Company has established and maintains disclosure controls and
procedures and internal control over financial reporting (as such terms are
defined in paragraphs (e) and (f), respectively, of Rule 13a-15 and paragraph
(e) of Rule 15d-15 under the Exchange Act) as required by Rules 13a-15 and
15d-15 under the Exchange Act. The Companys disclosure controls
and procedures are designed to ensure that all material information (both
financial and

 



13  non-financial) required to be disclosed by the Company in the reports that
it files or furnishes under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed,
summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the rules and
forms of the SEC, and that all such information is accumulated and
communicated to the Companys management as appropriate to allow timely
decisions regarding required disclosure and to make the
certifications required pursuant to Sections 302 and 906 of the Sarbanes-
Oxley Act. The Companys internal control over financial reporting is designed
to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial
reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes
in accordance with GAAP and includes policies and procedures that (i) pertain
to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly
reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the Company and
its Subsidiaries, (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are
recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in
accordance with GAAP, and that receipts and expenditures of the Company and
its Subsidiaries are being made only in accordance with authorizations of
management and directors of the Company, and (iii) provide reasonable
assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized
acquisition, use or disposition of the Companys or any of its Subsidiaries
assets that would be reasonably expected to have a material effect on its
financial statements. The Company has disclosed based on its most recently
completed evaluation of the Companys internal control over financial
reporting prior to the date of this Agreement to the Companys auditors and
the audit committee of the Board of Directors of the Company (A) any
"significant deficiencies" and "material weaknesses" in the design or
operation of its internal controls over financial reporting that are
reasonably likely to adversely affect the Companys ability to record,
process, summarize and report financial information and (B) any fraud,
whether or not material, that involves management or other employees who have
a significant role in the Companys internal control over financial reporting.
The terms "significant deficiencies" and "material weaknesses" have the
meanings assigned to such terms in Rule 13a-15(f) of the Exchange Act. Since
November 30, 2013, neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has
received any complaint, allegation, assertion or claim regarding
the accounting or auditing practices, procedures, methodologies or methods of
the Company or its Subsidiaries or their respective internal accounting
procedures, except as has not had and would not be reasonably expected to
have, individually or in the aggregate, a Company Material Adverse Effect.

(c) The consolidated financial statements (including all related notes and
schedules thereto) of the Company included in or incorporated by reference
into the Company SEC Documents (the " _Company SEC Financial Statements_ ")
comply in all material respects as to form with applicable accounting
requirements and the published rules and regulations of the SEC with respect
thereto. The Company SEC Financial Statements fairly present in all material
respects the consolidated financial position of the Company and its
consolidated Subsidiaries, as at the respective dates thereof, and the
consolidated results of their operations and their consolidated cash flows for
the respective periods then ended (subject, in the case of the unaudited
statements, to normal year-end audit adjustments that are not material and to
the absence of information or notes not required by GAAP to be included in
interim financial statements), all in conformity with GAAP applied on a
consistent basis during the periods involved (except as may be indicated
therein or in the notes thereto).

this Agreement (the " _Commitment Letter_ "), pursuant to the terms of which,
and subject to the conditions set forth therein, each of the Financing Sources

Letter (the " _Financing Conditions_ "). The proceeds of the Financing (both
before and after giving effect to the exercise of any or all "market flex"
provisions related thereto), together with cash on hand of Parent and, in the
event that Parent effects any long-term debt financing that replaces all or a
portion of the

 



30  Financing in accordance with Section 6.14(d), the proceeds of such debt
financing (any such long-term debt financing, a " _Replacement Financing_ "),

Consideration when due on the Closing Date and the payment of all costs, fees
and expenses required to be borne by Parent and its Subsidiaries in connection
with this Agreement on the Closing Date, as well as the repayment of all
outstanding indebtedness under the Amended and Restated Credit Agreement (such
amounts, collectively, the " _Merger Amounts_ "). As of the date hereof, no
event has occurred which would constitute a breach or default (or an event
which with notice or lapse of time or both would constitute a default), on the
part of Parent under the Commitment Letter or, to the Knowledge of Parent, any
other party to the Commitment Letter, which breach or default
would reasonably be expected to result in the inability of Parent to satisfy
any of the Financing Conditions on the Closing Date. Subject to the
satisfaction of the conditions contained in Section 7.1 and Section 7.2, as of
the date of this Agreement, Parent has no reason to believe that any of the
Financing Conditions will not be satisfied on or prior to the Closing Date.
Except for fee letters with respect to fees and related arrangements with
respect to the Financing, of which Parent has delivered true, correct and
complete copies (in a redacted form so long as such redaction does not cover
terms that would adversely affect the conditionality, availability or
termination of the Financing) to the Company prior to the execution and
delivery of this Agreement, there are no side letters or other agreements,
Contracts or arrangements related to the funding of the full amount of the

nor any other Person on behalf of the Company is making or has made, and each
of Parent and Merger Sub hereby agrees that it is not relying upon, any other

36 ARTICLE VI

 

ADDITIONAL AGREEMENTS

 

Section 6.1 _Preparation of the Proxy Statement_.

 

(a) As soon as reasonably practicable following the date of this Agreement,
and in any event, within 20 Business Days (subject to Parents compliance in
all material respects with this Section 6.1(a)) after the date of this
Agreement, the Company shall prepare and file with the SEC the Proxy Statement
in preliminary form. The Company shall use reasonable best efforts to provide
to Parent a substantially complete draft of the preliminary Proxy Statement as
soon as reasonably practicable but in any event within 17 Business Days after
the date of this Agreement. Each of the Company and Parent shall furnish
all information concerning itself and its Affiliates that is required to be
included in the Proxy Statement or that is customarily included in proxy
statements prepared in connection with transactions of the type contemplated
by this Agreement. Each of the Company and Parent covenant that none of the
information supplied or to be supplied by such party for inclusion or
incorporation in the Proxy Statement will, at the date it is first mailed to
the stockholders of the Company or at the time of the Company Stockholders
Meeting, contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any
material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the
statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they are made,
not misleading. The Company shall promptly notify Parent of the receipt of all
comments from the SEC or the staff of the SEC with respect to the Proxy
Statement and of any request by the SEC or the staff of the SEC for any
amendment or supplement thereto or for additional information and will
promptly provide to Parent copies of all written correspondence between the
Company and/or any of its Representatives, on the one hand, and the SEC or the
staff of the SEC, on the other hand, with respect to the Proxy Statement.
Each of the Company and Parent shall use its reasonable best efforts to
respond promptly to any comments from the SEC or the staff of the SEC on the
Proxy Statement. The Company shall cause the definitive Proxy Statement to be
mailed to the stockholders of the Company (i) if the SEC provides comments to
the preliminary Proxy Statement, as soon as reasonably practicable (and in any
event within five Business Days) after the date the SEC staff confirms that
it has no further comments thereon or (ii) if, within 10 calendar days after
the filing of the preliminary Proxy Statement, the SEC has not indicated that
it expects to have comments to the preliminary Proxy Statement, as soon
as reasonably practicable (and in any event within 10 Business Days after
such 10th calendar day). Except in the case of a filing, amendment or
supplement to the Proxy Statement in connection with a Recommendation
Withdrawal, no filing of, or amendment or supplement to, the Proxy Statement
shall be made by the Company, without providing Parent and its counsel a
reasonable opportunity to review and comment thereon and giving due
consideration to such comments.

(b) If at any time prior to the Company Stockholders Meeting (or any
adjournment or postponement thereof) any information relating to the Company
or Parent, or any of their respective Affiliates, directors or officers,
should be discovered by the Company or Parent which should be set forth in an
amendment or supplement to the Proxy Statement, so that such document would
not include any misstatement of a material fact or omit to state any material
fact necessary to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances
under which they were made, not misleading, the party which discovers such
information shall promptly notify the other

 



37  parties and an appropriate amendment or supplement describing such
information shall be promptly filed with the SEC and, to the extent required
by Law, disseminated to the stockholders of the Company.

Section 6.2 _Stockholders Meeting; Company Board Recommendation_. As promptly
as reasonably practicable (and in any event no more than 25 Business Days)
after the date of mailing of the Proxy Statement, the Company, acting through
its Board of Directors, and in accordance with applicable Law, the rules and
regulations of NYSE and the Company Charter and Company Bylaws, shall duly
call, give notice of, convene and hold a meeting of the stockholders of the
Company to consider and vote upon the adoption of this Agreement (the "
_Company Stockholders Meeting_ "). Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement
to the contrary, the Company shall be permitted to adjourn, delay or postpone
the Company Stockholders Meeting (a) with the consent of Parent, (b) as of the
time for which the Company Stockholders Meeting is scheduled, there
are insufficient shares of Company Common Stock represented (either in person
or by proxy) to constitute a quorum necessary to conduct business at such
Company Stockholders Meeting, (c) as of the time for which the Company
Stockholders Meeting is scheduled, there are insufficient shares of Company
Common Stock with respect to which proxies have been submitted to vote in
favor of the adoption of this Agreement to obtain the Company Stockholder
Approval or (d) to allow additional time for the filing and/or mailing of any
supplemental or amended disclosure that the Company has determined in good
faith (after consultation with its outside legal advisors) is required under
applicable Law and for such supplemental or amended disclosure to be
disseminated and reviewed in compliance with applicable Law by the Companys
stockholders prior to the Company Stockholders Meeting. Subject to Section
6.3, the Company shall include in the Proxy Statement the Company
Board Recommendation and use its reasonable best efforts to solicit the
Company Stockholder Approval at the Company Stockholders Meeting. The Company
shall keep Parent reasonably informed regarding its solicitation efforts and
proxy tallies following the mailing of the Proxy Statement, including by
allowing Parent and its Representatives to participate in any substantive
meeting or discussion with such proxy solicitor and directing such proxy
solicitor to deliver proxy tally reports to Parent concurrently with delivery
of such reports to the Company. The Companys obligations pursuant to this
Section 6.2 shall continue in full force and effect and shall not be affected
by (i) the commencement, public proposal, public disclosure or communication
to the Company of any Acquisition Proposal, or (ii) the Board of Directors
making a Recommendation Withdrawal.

 

Section 6.3 _No Solicitation_.

 

(a) The Company shall immediately cease all existing discussions or
negotiations with any Person (other than Parent and Merger Sub) that may be
ongoing with respect to an Acquisition Proposal and promptly inform any such
Person of the obligations under this Section 6.3 and to return or destroy all
confidential information. Except as permitted by this Section 6.3, from the
date of this Agreement until the earlier of the Effective Time or the date of
termination of this Agreement in accordance with Section 8.1, the Company
shall not, and shall cause each of its Subsidiaries and its and their
respective officers, directors, employees and agents not to, and shall direct
each of its investment bankers, financial advisors, attorneys, accountants and
other representatives (collectively, " _Representatives_ ") not to, directly
or indirectly, (i) solicit, initiate or knowingly facilitate or encourage any
inquiries or the making of any proposal or offer

 



38  which constitutes, or could reasonably be expected to lead to, any
Acquisition Proposal, (ii) furnish any nonpublic information regarding the
Company or its Subsidiaries to any Person in connection with or in response
to an Acquisition Proposal, (iii) engage in, continue or otherwise participate
in, any negotiations or discussions regarding any Acquisition Proposal or (iv)
approve, recommend or enter into, or propose to approve, recommend or enter
into, any letter of intent, memorandum of understanding, agreement in
principle, acquisition agreement, merger agreement or similar agreement (other
than an Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement entered into in accordance with
the terms of this Section 6.3) with respect to any Acquisition Proposal.

(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in Section 6.3(a), if
contacted by a Person making an Acquisition Proposal after the date of this
Agreement (i) the Company and its Representatives may contact the Person
making such Acquisition Proposal and its Representatives to ascertain facts
or clarify terms and conditions for the sole purpose of the Board of Directors
of the Company informing itself about the Acquisition Proposal and the Person
that made it and (ii) if, prior to obtaining Company Stockholder Approval but
not after, following the receipt of a bona fide written proposal, that did not
result from a breach of Section 6.3, which the Board of Directors of the
Company determines in good faith, after consultation with its
advisors, constitutes, or could reasonably be expected to lead to, a Superior
Proposal, the Company and the Company Representatives may, in response to such
Acquisition Proposal, and subject to compliance with Section 6.3(d), (A)
furnish information with respect to the Company and its Subsidiaries to the
Person making such Acquisition Proposal and its Representatives and financing
sources pursuant to an Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement; _provided_ that,
to the extent not previously made available to Parent, the Company furnishes
Parent with all such nonpublic information delivered to such Person promptly
after its delivery to such Person and (B) engage in discussions or
negotiations with such Person regarding such Acquisition Proposal. A breach
of this Section 6.3 by any Representative of the Company, acting by or on
behalf of the Company, will constitute a breach by the Company of this Section
6.3.

 

(c) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, including Section
6.1 and Section 6.2, but subject to compliance with this Section 6.3, prior
to receipt of the Company Stockholder Approval but not after, the Board of
Directors of the Company or any committee thereof may, in response to any
unsolicited, bona fide Acquisition Proposal from any Person that did not
result from a breach of this Section 6.3, (i) withdraw (or modify or qualify
in a manner adverse to Parent) the Company Board Recommendation, (ii) fail to
include the Company Board Recommendation in the Proxy Statement or (iii)
approve, adopt or recommend, or publicly propose to approve, adopt or
recommend, any Acquisition Proposal (any action described in these clauses
(i), (ii) or (iii) being referred to as a " _Recommendation Withdrawal_ "),
and subject to compliance with this Section 6.3(c) and Section 8.3(a),
terminate this Agreement in order to enter into a binding, definitive
acquisition agreement, merger agreement or similar agreement in respect
of such Acquisition Proposal, if (A) the Board of Directors of the Company
concludes in good faith, after consultation with its outside financial
advisors and outside legal counsel, that such Acquisition Proposal constitutes
a Superior Proposal; (B) the Board of Directors of the Company concludes in
good faith, after consultation with its outside legal counsel, that the
failure to make a Recommendation Withdrawal would be inconsistent with its
fiduciary duties to the stockholders of the Company under applicable Law; (C)
the Board of Directors of the Company, prior to making a Recommendation
Withdrawal or terminating this Agreement, as applicable, provides Parent four
Business Days prior written notice of its intention to take such

 



39  action, which notice shall include the information with respect to such
Acquisition Proposal that is specified in Section 6.3(d), as well as a copy of
such Acquisition Proposal (it being agreed that the delivery of such notice
by the Company shall not constitute a Recommendation Withdrawal); (D) during
the four Business Days following such written notice (or such shorter period
as is specified below), if requested by Parent, the Board of Directors of the
Company and its Representatives shall have negotiated in good faith with
Parent regarding any revisions to the terms of this Agreement proposed by
Parent in response to such Acquisition Proposal; and (E) at the end of the
four Business Day period described in the foregoing clause (D), the Board of
Directors of the Company concludes in good faith, after consultation with its
outside legal counsel and financial advisors (and taking into account any
adjustment or modification of the terms of this Agreement proposed by
Parent), that the Acquisition Proposal continues to be a Superior Proposal and
that the failure to make a Recommendation Withdrawal in respect of a Superior
Proposal would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties to the stockholders
of the Company under applicable Law. Any material amendment to any Superior
Proposal will be deemed to be a new Acquisition Proposal for purposes of this
Section 6.3(c); _provided_ , _however_ , that the notice period and the
period during which the Company and its Representatives are required, if
requested by Parent, to negotiate with Parent regarding any revisions to the
terms of this Agreement proposed in writing by Parent in response to such new
Acquisition Proposal pursuant to clauses (C), (D) and (E) above shall expire
two Business Days after the Company provides written notice of such new
Acquisition Proposal to Parent.

 

(d) In addition to the obligations of the Company set forth in Section 6.3(a),
Section 6.3(b) and Section 6.3(c), the Company shall promptly, and in any
event no later than 48 hours after it receives any Acquisition Proposal or
request for information, advise Parent in writing of any request for
confidential information in connection with an Acquisition Proposal or of
any Acquisition Proposal, the material terms and conditions of such request
or Acquisition Proposal and the identity of the Person making such request or
Acquisition Proposal and, if applicable, provide copies of any such written
request or Acquisition Proposal, including any proposed agreements between
the Company and the parties making the Acquisition Proposal, to Parent and
shall keep Parent reasonably informed on a reasonably current basis (but in no
event more often than once every 48 hours) of all material modifications to
the terms of any Acquisition Proposal.

(e) Nothing in this Agreement shall prohibit or restrict the Board of
Directors of the Company, from effecting, and the Board of Directors of the
Company may effect, a Recommendation Withdrawal at any time prior to obtaining
the Company Stockholder Approval, but not after, if (i) an Intervening Event
has occurred and is continuing and (ii) the Board of Directors of the Company
concludes in good faith, after consultation with its outside legal counsel,
that the failure to effect a Recommendation Withdrawal in response to such
Intervening Event would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties to the
stockholders of the Company under applicable Law; _provided_ , _however_ ,
that no Recommendation Withdrawal pursuant to this Section 6.3(e) may be made
unless (i) the Board of Directors of the Company provides Parent four
Business Days prior written notice that it intends to take such action and
provides reasonable detail with respect to such Intervening Event (it being
agreed that the delivery of such notice by the Company shall not constitute a
Recommendation Withdrawal) and (ii) during the four Business Days following
such written notice, if requested by Parent, (A) the Board of Directors of the
Company and its Representatives shall have negotiated in good faith with
Parent regarding any revisions to the terms of this Agreement proposed by
Parent in response to such

 



40  notice and (B) at the end of such four Business Day period, the Board of
Directors of the Company concludes in good faith, after consultation with its
outside legal counsel and financial advisors (and taking into account any
adjustment or modification of the terms of this Agreement proposed by Parent),
that the failure to make a Recommendation Withdrawal would be inconsistent
with its fiduciary duties to the stockholders of the Company under applicable
Law.

(f) Nothing contained in this Section 6.3 shall prohibit the Company or the
Board of Directors of the Company from (i) taking and disclosing to the
stockholders of the Company a position contemplated by Rule 14e-2(a) under the
Exchange Act or making a statement contemplated by Item 1012(a) of Regulation
M-A or Rule 14d-9 under the Exchange Act, (ii) making any disclosure to the
stockholders of the Company if the Board of Directors of the Company
determines in good faith, after consultation with its outside legal counsel,
that the failure to make such disclosure would be inconsistent with
applicable Law or (iii) informing any Person of the existence of the
provisions contained in this Section 6.3; _provided_ , that any Recommendation
Withdrawal may only be made in accordance with Section 6.3(c) or Section
6.3(e); and _provided_ , _further_ , that if any disclosure permitted under
clause (i) above or, to the extent related to an Acquisition Proposal or
Intervening Event, clause (ii) above does not reaffirm the Company Board
Recommendation, such disclosure will be deemed to be a Recommendation
Withdrawal and Parent will have the right to terminate this Agreement as set
forth in Section 8.1(c)(ii); it being understood that, notwithstanding
anything herein to the contrary, any "stop, look and listen" communication to
the stockholders of the Company pursuant to Rule 14d-9(f) under the Exchange
Act shall not in and of itself be deemed to be or constitute a Recommendation
Withdrawal. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, a
factually accurate statement that describes the Companys receipt of an
Acquisition Proposal and the operation of this Agreement with respect thereto
shall not, in and of itself, be deemed to be a Recommendation Withdrawal.

(g) For purposes of this Agreement:

 

" _Acquisition Proposal_ " means any proposal or offer (whether or not in
writing) from any Person (other than Parent or any of its Subsidiaries or
Affiliates) relating to, or that would reasonably be expected to lead to, (i)
any direct or indirect acquisition or purchase, in one transaction or a series
of related transactions, of assets (including equity securities of any
Subsidiary of the Company) or businesses that constitute 20% or more of the

Persons beneficially owning (which has the meaning under Section 13(d) of the
Exchange Act) securities of the Company representing 20% or more of the
aggregate voting power of all securities of the Company or (iii) any merger,
consolidation, business combination, recapitalization, liquidation,
dissolution, joint venture, share exchange or similar transaction involving

41 " _Intervening Event_ " means a material event or circumstance that first
arises or occurs after the date of this Agreement and prior to the Company
Stockholder Approval that was not known and was not reasonably foreseeable to
the Board of Directors of the Company on the date of this Agreement, which

addressed by and be subject to Section 6.3), (ii) the Requisite Regulatory
Approvals or any action taken by Parent or Merger Sub or any of their
Subsidiaries or Affiliates in accordance with Section 6.2 or the consequences
of any such action, (iii) changes in the market price or trading volume of
shares of Company Common Stock (except that the facts or occurrences giving
rise to or contributing to any such change, to the extent such facts or
circumstances otherwise fall within the definition of "Intervening Event,"
may be considered in evaluating whether an Intervening Event has occurred) or
(iv) the Company or any of its Subsidiaries exceeding, or failing to meet,

Proposal (with all references to "20%" in the definition of Acquisition
Proposal being deemed to be references to "50%") made that is on terms that
the Board of Directors of the Company determines in good faith (after

account the timing and likelihood of consummation, legal, financial,
regulatory and other aspects of the proposal (including any conditions to
consummation and financing terms), and such other factors as the Board of
Directors considers to be appropriate, is more favorable to the stockholders
of the Company than the Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby
(after taking into account any revisions to the terms of this Agreement
pursuant to this Section 6.3).

Section 6.4 _Access to Information_. The Company shall, and shall cause each
of its Subsidiaries to, afford the Representatives of Parent reasonable
access during normal business hours to its and its Subsidiaries properties,
books and records (including Tax records and information to the extent

obligations pursuant to Contracts all other information concerning

Parent may reasonably request; _provided_ , _however_ , that (a) such access
shall not unreasonably interfere with the business or operations of the
Company and its Subsidiaries, (b) the Company shall not be obligated to
provide such access or information if the Company determines, in its
reasonable judgment, that doing so would violate applicable Law or a Contract
or obligation of confidentiality owing to a third party, jeopardize the
protection of the attorney-client or any other privilege, or expose such party
to risk of liability for disclosure of sensitive or personal information (any
such information, the " _Restricted Information_ ") (provided that in such
instances the Company shall inform Parent of the general nature of the access
or information being withheld and, upon Parents request, reasonably cooperate

42  foregoing clause (b)) and (c) the Company will be permitted to redact any
information or documentation provided to the extent that such information or
documentation includes competitively or commercially sensitive information;

those Persons who have entered into or are bound by a confidentiality
agreement with it or who are Representatives of Parent that are permitted to
have access to such information in accordance with the terms of the
Confidentiality Agreement, and to the extent required by applicable Law or
Contract to which the Company or its respective Subsidiaries is a party.
In conducting any inspection of any properties of the Company and its
Subsidiaries, Parent and its Representatives shall not (i) unreasonably
interfere with the business conducted at such property or (ii) damage any
property or any portion thereof. Prior to the Effective Time, Parent and its
Representatives shall not have the right to conduct environmental testing or
sampling at any of the facilities or properties of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries. All information obtained pursuant to this Section 6.4 (or
otherwise pursuant to this Agreement) shall continue to be governed by the
Confidentiality Agreement which shall remain in full force and effect in
accordance with its terms. Nothing in this Section 6.4 shall require the
Company to permit the inspection of, or to disclose, any Acquisition Proposals
(except as required by Section 6.3) or any information regarding or related to
the deliberations of the Board of Directors of the Company with respect to
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, the entry into the Agreement
or any materials provided to the Board of Directors of the Company in
connection therewith.

 

Section 6.5 _Consents, Approvals and Filings_.

 

(a) Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement,
Parent and the Company shall, and shall cause their respective Subsidiaries
to, use their reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, as
promptly as practicable, all actions necessary, proper or advisable to
consummate the Merger as promptly as practicable, including to use reasonable
best efforts to, as promptly as practicable, (i) cause all of the conditions
to Closing to be satisfied, (ii) prepare and file all filings and submissions
under the HSR Act, in connection with the Requisite Regulatory Approvals and
in connection with any other Antitrust Law that the parties mutually agree is
advisable (the " _Other Antitrust Approvals_ "), (iii) obtain all Consents,
Orders, actions or nonactions, waivers and clearances required under the HSR
Act and in connection with the Requisite Regulatory Approvals and the Other
Antitrust Approvals and (iv) obtain all necessary material consents or waivers
from non-Governmental Entity third parties (provided that in no event shall
the Company or its Subsidiaries be obligated to pay or to commit to pay to
any Person whose consent or waiver is being sought any cash or other
consideration, or make any accommodation or commitment or incur any liability
or other obligation to such Person in connection with such consent or
waiver). In furtherance and not in limitation thereof, (i) not later than ten
Business Days following the date of this Agreement or when the parties
mutually agree advisable, the Company and Parent shall each make an
appropriate filing of a notification and report form pursuant to the HSR Act
with the Federal Trade Commission and the Antitrust Division of the United
States Department of Justice with respect to the Merger and the transactions
contemplated hereby and (ii) not later than twenty Business Days following
the date of this Agreement or when the parties mutually agree advisable, the
Company and Parent shall each make the appropriate Filings in connection with
the Requisite Regulatory Approvals, and when the parties mutually agree
advisable with respect to the Other Antitrust Approvals. Parent and the
Company shall promptly notify the other party of any notice or other
communication 

 



43  from any Governmental Entity received by such party alleging that such
Governmental Entitys consent is or may be required in connection with or as a
condition of the Merger. If requested by Parent, the Company will promptly
provide the Parent with a certificate executed by the Company that meets the
requirements of Treasury Regulation Sections 1.897-2(h) and 1.1445-2(c)(3),
dated no earlier than five days prior to the Closing Date and in form and
substance reasonably satisfactory to Parent, along with written authorization
for Parent to deliver such certificate to the IRS on behalf of the Company
upon Closing.

 

(b) The Company and Parent shall use reasonable best efforts to (i) cooperate
and coordinate with the other party in the taking of the actions contemplated
by Section 6.5, (ii) provide such assistance as the other party may reasonably
request in connection with the foregoing, including supplying the other party
with any information that the other party may reasonably request in order to
effectuate the taking of such actions and (iii) keep the other party
reasonably and timely informed of any developments, meetings, or discussions
with any Governmental Entity under any Antitrust Laws, and any inquiries
or requests for additional information, from any Governmental Entity under
any Antitrust Laws. If the Company or Parent receives a formal or informal
request for additional information or documentary material from any
Governmental Entity under any Antitrust Laws with respect to the Merger or
the transactions contemplated hereby, then it shall use reasonable best
efforts to make, or cause to be made, as promptly as reasonably practicable
and after consultation with the other party, an appropriate response in
compliance with such request. In addition, to the extent practicable, none of
the parties shall agree to participate in any substantive meeting or
conference (telephone, in-person or otherwise) with any Governmental
Entity, or any member of the staff of any Governmental Entity, in respect of
any Filing, proceeding, investigation (including any settlement of the
investigation), litigation, or other inquiry under any Antitrust Laws unless
it consults with the other party in advance and, where permitted by such
Governmental Entity, allows the other party to participate. To the extent
reasonably practicable, legal counsel for Parent and for the Company shall
have the right to review in advance, and will consult with the other party on
and consider in good faith the views of the other party in connection with,
all of the information relating to Parent or the Company, as the case may be,
and any of their respective Subsidiaries and Representatives, that appears in
any Filing made with, or written materials submitted to, any third party or
Governmental Entity in connection with the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated hereby. In exercising the foregoing rights, each of Parent and
the Company shall act reasonably and as promptly as practicable. Subject to
its obligations under this Section 6.5, Parent shall (i) have the principal
responsibility for devising and implementing the strategy for obtaining any
Requisite Regulatory Approvals or any Other Antitrust Approvals and (ii) lead
and direct all submissions to, meetings and communications with any
Governmental Entity or other party in connection with related antitrust
matters, including litigation matters with respect to any Antitrust Laws;
_provided_ , _however_ , that Parent shall consult in advance (to the extent
reasonably practicable) with the Company, and in good faith take the Companys
views into account regarding the overall strategic direction with respect to
such process, consult with the Company prior to taking any material
substantive positions, making dispositive motions or other material
substantive filings or submissions or entering in any negotiations
concerning such approvals, if applicable. Information disclosed pursuant to
this Section 6.5 shall be subject to the Confidentiality Agreement and Section
6.5(e) hereof. Neither Parent nor the Company shall be required to comply with
any of the foregoing provisions of this Section 6.5(b) to the extent that
such compliance would be prohibited by applicable Law. The parties shall not
voluntarily extend

 



44  any waiting period associated with any Consent of any Governmental Entity or
enter into any agreement with any Governmental Entity not to consummate the
Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby, except with the prior
written consent of the other party(ies).

(c) In furtherance and not in limitation of the other provisions in this
Section 6.5, Parent and Merger Sub agree to take, and to cause their
respective Subsidiaries (including, with respect to any action to be effective
as of or after the Effective Time, the Company and its Subsidiaries) to
take, in each case as promptly as practicable (and in any event prior to the
Outside Date), any and all steps necessary to avoid, eliminate or resolve each
and every impediment under any Antitrust Law that may be asserted by any
Governmental Entity and obtain all clearances, consents, approvals and
waivers under Antitrust Laws that may be required by any Governmental Entity
(including complying with all restrictions and conditions, if any, imposed or
requested by any Governmental Entity in connection with granting any
necessary Consent, Order, actions or nonactions, waiver or clearance, or
terminating any applicable waiting period), so as to enable the parties to
consummate the Merger and the transactions contemplated hereby as soon as
practicable (and in any event prior to the Outside Date), including proposing,
negotiating, committing to and effecting, by consent decree, hold separate
orders, trust, or otherwise, (i) the sale, divestiture, license or other
disposition of any Subsidiaries, operations, divisions, businesses, product
lines, customers or assets of Parent and/or the Company or any of their
respective Subsidiaries, (ii) any limitation or modification of any of the
businesses, services, products or operations of Parent and/or the Company or
any of their respective Subsidiaries, (iii) the termination, relinquishment,
modification, or waiver of existing relationships, ventures, contractual
rights, obligations or other arrangements of Parent and/or the Company or any
of their respective Subsidiaries and/or (iv) the creation of any
relationships, ventures, contractual rights, obligations or other arrangements
of Parent and/or the Company or any of their respective Subsidiaries (each a
" _Remedial Action_ "); _provided,_ _however_ , that (i) Parent and the
Company (and their respective Subsidiaries) will not be required to take any
Remedial Action that is not conditioned upon consummation of the Merger and
(ii) notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, Parent will
not be required to take or commit to take any Remedial Action that would
constitute a Triggering Divestiture. In addition, in furtherance and not in
limitation of the other provisions in this Section 6.5, Parent shall take all
actions (A) necessary to defend, including through pursuing litigation on the
merits, any administrative or judicial action or proceeding asserted or
threatened by any Governmental Entity or any other Person under Antitrust
Laws (including pursuing all available avenues of administrative and/or
judicial appeal) that seeks, or would reasonably be expected to seek, to
prevent, restrain, impede, delay, enjoin, or otherwise prohibit the
consummation of the Merger and the transactions contemplated hereby and (B)
necessary in order to avoid entry of, or to have vacated or terminated, any
Order (whether temporary, preliminary or permanent) entered, issued or
threatened that would prevent, restrain, impede, delay, enjoin or otherwise
prohibit the consummation of the Merger and the transactions contemplated
hereby, prior to the Outside Date; _provided_ , _however_ , that the
obligations set forth in this sentence shall not limit the obligation of
Parent to take, and/or to cause its Subsidiaries to take, any Remedial Action
or to otherwise comply with its obligations set forth in this Section 6.5(c).

 

(d) Neither Parent nor the Company shall, and each shall cause its respective
Subsidiaries not to, directly or indirectly, acquire, purchase, lease or
license (or agree to acquire, purchase, lease or license), by merging with or
into or consolidating with, or by purchasing a

 



45  substantial portion of the assets of or equity in, any business or any
corporation, partnership, association or other business organization or
division or part thereof, or any securities or collection of assets, if doing
so would reasonably be expected to: (i) impose any material delay in the
obtaining of, or materially increase the risk of not obtaining, any Consent,
action or nonaction, waiver, clearance or exemption of any Governmental
Entity necessary to consummate the Merger and the transactions contemplated
hereby or the expiration or termination of any applicable waiting period; (ii)
materially increase the risk of any Governmental Entity entering an
Order preventing, restraining, impeding, delaying, enjoining or otherwise
prohibiting the consummation of the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated hereby; (iii) materially increase the risk of not being able to
remove any such Order on appeal or otherwise or (iv) prevent or materially
delay the consummation of the Merger and the transactions contemplated hereby.

(e) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Section 6.5, (i) if any
information or documentation provided by the delivering party to the other
party pursuant to this Section 6.5 contains competitively or commercially
sensitive material, if requested by the delivering party, such information or
documentation will only be provided to outside antitrust counsel of the
receiving party (and/or to such other individuals of the receiving party or
the Representatives thereof to whom the delivering party expressly provides
permission, including pursuant to the terms of that certain Joint Defense,
Common Interest, and Confidentiality Agreement, by and among the Company,
Parent, and their respective counsel (the " _Permitted Individuals_ "), and
shall not be disclosed by such outside antitrust counsel or other Permitted
Individuals to any individuals other than Permitted Individuals (including
employees, officers or directors of the receiving party) unless express
permission is obtained in advance from the delivering party and (ii) any
information or documentation provided pursuant to this Section 6.5 may be
redacted to the extent necessary (A) to comply with any contractual
arrangement, (B) to remove references concerning valuation or (C) to address
privilege or confidentiality concerns.

 

Section 6.6 _Employee Matters_.

 

(a) Until the first anniversary of the Effective Time (the " _Benefits
Continuation Period_ "), the Surviving Corporation shall provide, or cause to
be provided, for those employees of the Company and its Subsidiaries who
continue as employees of the Surviving Corporation or any of its Subsidiaries
during all or a portion of the Benefits Continuation Period (the "
_Continuing Employees_ "), compensation (including base salary or hourly wage
rate and annual target and maximum bonus opportunity but excluding equity-
based incentive compensation opportunities and employee stock purchase plans)
and employee benefits that in the aggregate shall be substantially similar to
the compensation and employee benefits provided by the Company or the
applicable Subsidiary to the Continuing Employees immediately prior to the
Effective Time. Notwithstanding the foregoing, with respect to the fiscal
year during which the Closing occurs, the Surviving Corporation shall pay a
pro rata portion of the bonus each Continuing Employee would be eligible to
receive under the Company Value Added Plan (the " _CVA_ ") for such fiscal
year as if the applicable performance goals had been achieved at the target
level of performance based on the number of days that lapse beginning on the
first day of such fiscal year and ending on the Closing (provided such
Continuing Employee is not otherwise eligible or entitled to receive a CVA
cash bonus for the same period). Nothing herein shall be deemed to be a
guarantee of employment for any current or former employee of the Company or

 



46  any of its Subsidiaries, or, other than as provided in any applicable
employment agreement or other Contract, to restrict the right of Parent or the
Surviving Corporation to terminate the employment of any such employee.

(b) The Surviving Corporation shall use reasonable best efforts to (i) waive
any applicable pre-existing condition exclusions and waiting periods with
respect to participation and coverage requirements in any replacement or
successor welfare benefit plan of the Surviving Corporation in which a
Continuing Employee is eligible to participate following the Effective Time
to the extent such exclusions or waiting periods were inapplicable to, or had
been satisfied by, such Continuing Employee immediately prior to the Effective
Time under the analogous Company Benefit Plan in which such Continuing
Employee participated, (ii) provide each Continuing Employee with credit for
any co-payments and deductibles paid prior to the Effective Time during the
plan year that includes the Effective Time (to the same extent such credit
was given under the analogous Company Benefit Plan prior to the Effective
Time) in satisfying any applicable deductible or out-of-pocket requirements
for the plan year that includes the Effective Time and (iii) recognize service
prior to the Effective Time with the Company or any of its Subsidiaries for
purposes of eligibility to participate and vesting and level of benefits for
vacation and severance benefits under any employee benefit plan of the
Surviving Corporation in which a Continuing Employee is eligible to
participate following the Effective Time that is analogous and corresponding
to a Company Benefit Plan in which such Continuing Employee participated
immediately prior to the Effective Time to the same extent such service was
recognized by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries under such analogous and
corresponding Company Benefit Plan; _provided_ , _however_ , that the
foregoing shall not apply to the extent it would result in any duplication
of benefits for the same period of service; _provided_ , _further_ , that,
for the avoidance of doubt, the Surviving Corporation shall not be obligated
to provide credit for years of service for benefit accrual purposes under any
defined benefit pension plan maintained by the Surviving Corporation or its
Subsidiaries prior to the date on which the Continuing Employee actually
becomes a participant in such plan (it being understood that the Surviving
Corporation shall in all cases provide credit for years of service for
benefit accrual as required by any Company Benefit Plan).

(c) If requested by Parent in writing within 30 Business Days prior to the
Effective Time, effective immediately prior to, and contingent upon, the
Effective Time, the Company will adopt such resolutions and/or amendments to
terminate each Company Benefit Plan listed in Section 6.6(c) of the Company
Disclosure Letter (each, a " _Terminated Plan_ "). Prior to the Effective
Time, the Company will provide Parent with a copy of the resolutions and/or
plan amendments (the form and substance of which will be subject to review
and approval by Parent) evidencing that each Terminated Plan has been
terminated.

(d) From and after the Effective Time, Parent shall or shall cause the
Surviving Corporation to honor, in accordance with its terms, each change in
control agreement and nonqualified deferred compensation plan identified in
Section 6.6(d) of the Company Disclosure Letter and each other Company
Benefit Plan expressly requiring the Surviving Corporation or its successor to
assume such Company Benefit Plan. Parent and Merger Sub acknowledge that the
consummation of the Merger and the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement will constitute a change in control of the Company under the terms
of the Company Benefit Plans containing provisions triggering payment, vesting
or other rights upon a change in control or similar transaction.

 



47 (e) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement to the contrary,
Parent shall or shall cause the Surviving Corporation to provide Continuing
Employees who experience a qualifying employment termination during the
Benefits Continuation Period with severance benefits as set forth on Section
6.6(e) of the Company Disclosure Letter. 

(f) If requested by Parent in writing within 30 days prior to the Effective
Time, the Company will, at least one day prior to the Effective Time, adopt
the amendments described in Section 6.6(f) of the Company Disclosure Letter,
in a form reasonably satisfactory to Parent, to the benefit plans and
arrangements set forth and described on Section 6.6(f) of the
Company Disclosure Letter. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company will
provide Parent with a copy of the amendments evidencing that such amendments
have been adopted.

 

(g) Notwithstanding anything contained herein to the contrary, with respect to
any Continuing Employees who are covered by a collective bargaining agreement
or labor union contract or who are based outside of the United States, Parent
s obligations under this Section 6.6 shall be in addition to, but without
duplication, and not in contravention of, any obligations under the
applicable collective bargaining agreement or labor union contract or under
the Laws of the foreign countries and political subdivisions thereof in which
such Continuing Employees are based.

 

(h) Nothing contained in this Agreement, whether express or implied, (i) shall
be treated as an amendment or other modification of any Company Benefit Plan
or any employee benefit plan maintained or sponsored by Parent or its
Subsidiaries, (ii) shall create any third-party beneficiary rights in any
Continuing Employee or any other Person or (iii) shall limit the right
of Parent or the Surviving Corporation or any of their Subsidiaries to amend,
terminate or otherwise modify any Company Benefit Plan following the Closing
Date.

 

Section 6.7 _Expenses_. Whether or not the Merger is consummated, all expenses
incurred in connection with this Agreement and the transactions contemplated
hereby shall be paid by the party incurring such expenses, except as otherwise
provided in this Agreement (including Section 6.8 and Section 6.15(b)).

 

Section 6.8 _Directors  and Officers Indemnification and Insurance_.

 

(a) From and after the Effective Time, Parent shall cause the Surviving
Corporation, to the fullest extent permitted by Law (including to the fullest
extent authorized or permitted by any amendments to or replacements of
applicable Law adopted after the date of this Agreement that increase the
extent to which indemnification may be provided), to indemnify, defend and
hold harmless (and promptly advance expenses from time to time as incurred to
the fullest extent permitted by Law, _provided_ , the Person to whom expenses
are advanced provides a reasonable and customary undertaking (which shall not
include posting of any collateral) to repay such advances, if it is
ultimately determined that such Person is not entitled to indemnification)
each Person who is now, or has been at any time prior to the Effective Time or
who becomes prior to the Effective Time, a director or officer of the Company
or any of its Subsidiaries, any Person

 



48  acting as director, officer, trustee, fiduciary, employee or agent of
another entity or enterprise (including any Company Benefit Plan) who is or
has acted as such at the request of the Company (each an " _Indemnified
Party_ ") from and against any and all costs or expenses (including attorneys
fees, expenses and disbursements), judgments, fines, losses, claims, damages,
penalties, liabilities and amounts paid in settlement or incurred in
connection with any actual or threatened claim (including a claim of violation
of applicable Law), action, audit, demand, suit, proceeding or investigation,
whether civil, criminal, administrative, regulatory or investigative or other
proceeding at law or in equity or order or ruling, arising out of, relating to
or in connection with any circumstances, developments or matters in existence,
or acts or omissions occurring or alleged to occur prior to or at the
Effective Time (including by reason of such Indemnified Partys service as
such a director or officer of the Company or its Subsidiaries or as such a
director, officer, trustee, fiduciary, employee or agent of another Person),
including the approval of this Agreement and the Merger and the other
transactions contemplated hereby or arising out of or pertaining to the Merger
and the other transactions contemplated hereby, whether asserted or claimed
prior to, at or after the Effective Time. Parent and the Surviving
Corporation shall reasonably cooperate with any Indemnified Party in the
defense of any matter covered by this Section 6.8.

 

(b) Subject to the following sentence, the Surviving Corporation shall, and
Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, at no expense to the
beneficiaries, either (i) continue to maintain in full force and effect for
six years from the Effective Time, if available, the current directors and
officers liability insurance and fiduciary liability insurance (the "
_Current Insurance_ ") with respect to matters existing or occurring at or
prior to the Effective Time (including the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated hereby); _provided_ that the Surviving Corporation
may substitute for the Current Insurance policies of at least the same
coverage containing terms and conditions that are not less favorable in the
aggregate with respect to matters existing or occurring at or prior to the
Effective Time (including the Merger and the other transactions contemplated
hereby); or (ii) purchase a six year extended reporting period endorsement
with respect to the Current Insurance (a " _Reporting Tail Endorsement_ ") and
maintain this endorsement in full force and effect for its full term. To the
extent purchased after the date of this Agreement and prior to the Effective
Time, such insurance policies shall be placed through such broker(s) and with
such insurance carriers as may be specified by Parent and as are reasonably
acceptable to the Company; _provided_ that such insurance carrier has at least
an "A" rating by A.M. Best with respect to directors and officers liability
insurance and fiduciary liability insurance. Notwithstanding the first
sentence of this Section 6.8(b), but subject to the second sentence of this
Section 6.8(b), the Company will use reasonable best efforts to purchase a
Reporting Tail Endorsement prior to the Effective Time upon terms and
conditions reasonably acceptable to each of Parent and the Company.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, in no event shall Parent or the Surviving
Corporation be required to expend for such policies an annual premium amount
in excess of 300% of the annual premiums currently paid by the Company for
such insurance; and, if the annual premiums of such insurance coverage exceed
such amount, the Surviving Corporation shall obtain a policy with the greatest
coverage available for a cost not exceeding such amount; _provided_ that in
the event of the Current Insurance, Parent or the Surviving Corporation shall
be required to obtain as much coverage as is possible under substantially
similar policies for such maximum annual amount in aggregate annual premiums.

 



49 (c) The certificate of incorporation and bylaws of the Surviving Corporation
shall include provisions for indemnification, advancement and reimbursement
of expenses and exculpation of the Indemnified Parties on the same basis as
set forth in the Company Charter and the Company Bylaws in effect on the date
of this Agreement. Following the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation
shall, and Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, maintain in effect
the provisions in its certificate of incorporation and bylaws providing for
indemnification, advancement and reimbursement of expenses and exculpation of
Indemnified Parties, as applicable, with respect to the facts or circumstances
occurring at or prior to the Effective Time, to the fullest extent permitted
from time to time under applicable Law, which provisions shall not be amended
except as required by applicable Law or except to make changes permitted by
applicable Law that would enlarge the scope of the Indemnified Parties
indemnification and advancement rights thereunder.

 

(d) If Parent or the Surviving Corporation or any of their respective
successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any other Person
and is not the continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such
consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers all or substantially all of its
properties and assets to any Person, then, and in each such case, Parent shall
cause proper provisions to be made prior to the consummation of any
transaction of the type described in clause (i) or clause (ii) of this
sentence so that the successors and assigns of Parent or the Surviving
Corporation, as the case may be, shall assume all of the obligations set
forth in this Section 6.8.

(e) From and after the Effective Time, Parent and the Surviving Corporation
shall not, directly or indirectly, amend, modify, limit or terminate the
advancement and reimbursement of expenses, exculpation, indemnification
provisions of the agreements listed in Section 6.8(e) of the Company
Disclosure Letter between the Company or any Subsidiary and any of the
Indemnified Parties, or any such provisions contained in the Surviving
Corporation bylaws.

 

(f) This Section 6.8 is intended for the irrevocable benefit of, and to grant
third-party rights to, the Indemnified Parties and shall be binding on all
successors and assigns of Parent and the Surviving Corporation. The
obligations of Parent and the Surviving Corporation under this Section 6.8
shall not be terminated or modified in such a manner as to adversely affect
any Indemnified Party unless the affected Indemnified Party shall have
consented in writing to such termination or modification. It is expressly
agreed that each Indemnified Party shall be a third-party beneficiary of this
Section 6.8, and entitled to enforce the covenants contained in this Section
6.8. If any Indemnified Party makes any claim for indemnification or
advancement of expenses under this Section 6.8 that is denied by Parent and/or
the Surviving Corporation, and a court of competent jurisdiction determines
that the Indemnified Party is entitled to such indemnification or advancement,
then Parent or the Surviving Corporation shall pay such Indemnified Partys
costs and expenses, including legal fees and expenses, incurred in connection
with pursuing such claim against Parent and/or the Surviving Corporation. The
rights of the Indemnified Parties under this Section 6.8 shall be in addition
to, and not in substitution for, any rights such Indemnified Parties may have
under the Company Charter and the Company Bylaws, the certificate of
incorporation and bylaws (or comparable organizational documents) of any of
the Companys Subsidiaries or the bylaws of the Surviving Corporation or
under any applicable Contracts, insurance policies or Laws and Parent shall,
and shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, honor and perform under all
indemnification agreements entered into by the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries.

 



50 (g) Nothing in this Agreement is intended to, shall be construed to or shall
release, waive or impair any rights to directors and officers insurance
claims under any policy that is or has been in existence with respect to the
Company or any of its respective Subsidiaries for any of their respective
directors, officers or other employees, it being understood and agreed that

the extent permitted by applicable Law, waiver of such conditions) and the
conditions set forth in Exhibit B to the Commitment Letter have been satisfied
or upon funding would be satisfied, causing the Financing Sources to fund the
Financing in accordance with its terms on the Closing Date in the event the
conditions set forth in Section 7.1 and Section 7.2 of this Agreement have

are to be satisfied at Closing, but subject to the satisfaction or, to the
extent permitted by applicable Law, waiver of such conditions), and the
conditions to the Financing have been satisfied or, upon funding would
be satisfied, in each case to the extent the Financing is needed to

circumstance that, with or without notice, lapse of time or both, could
reasonably be expected to give rise to any material breach or default) by any
party to the Commitment Letter or any Financing Agreements, (ii) of, to the

or from the sources contemplated by the Commitment Letter or any Financing
Agreements. Parent shall keep the Company informed on a reasonably current
basis of the status of its efforts to arrange the Financing contemplated by

the Commitment Letter (including all exhibits, schedules and annexes thereto)
or any commitment letter (including all exhibits, schedules and annexes
thereto and fee letters, provided that fee letters may be in redacted form so
long as such redaction does not cover terms that would adversely affect the
conditionality, availability or termination of the Financing) with respect to
any Substitute Financing or Replacement Financing and (B) the Financing
Agreements.

 

(c) Parent shall not agree to any termination, amendment or other
modifications to the Commitment Letter without the prior written consent
of the Company if such termination, amendment or other modification (i) would
reduce the aggregate amount of the Financing below the amount necessary to pay
the Merger Amounts or (ii) would impose new or additional conditions or
would otherwise modify any conditions or other terms to the Financing in a
manner that would be reasonably likely to (A) materially delay or prevent the
Closing or (B) make the timely funding of the Financing or satisfaction of the
Financing Conditions materially less likely to occur, other than, in each
case, (1) a waiver of any closing conditions by any Financing Sources or their
agent or (2) to add lenders, lead arrangers, bookrunners, syndication agents
or similar entities who had not executed the Commitment Letter as of the date
hereof or to reassign titles to such parties who had executed the Commitment
Letter as of the date hereof; _provided_ , that Parent shall have the right to
substitute other financing for all or any portion of the Financing from the
same or alternative Financing Sources as set forth (and subject to the
requirements) in this Section 6.14, without the Companys prior written
consent (except as otherwise required below). Upon any such amendment,
modification or substitution (including with any Replacement Financing), the
term "Commitment Letter" and "Financing Agreements" shall mean the Commitment
Letter or Financing Agreement, as applicable, as so amended or modified;
_provided_ , that in the event the commitments under the Commitment Letter are
reduced as a result of or in connection with any Replacement Financing, the
term "Financing" shall be deemed to include such Replacement Financing.

(d) Parent shall have the right to substitute the proceeds of consummated
equity offerings or debt offerings or other incurrences of debt for all or
any portion of the Financing contemplated by the Commitment Letter by reducing
commitments under the Commitment Letter; _provided_ , that (i) to the extent
any such equity or debt has a scheduled special or mandatory redemption
right, such right is not exercisable prior to the earliest of the consummation
of the Merger on the Closing Date, the termination of this Agreement, and the
Outside Date and (ii) the conditions to the use of such proceeds to pay the
aggregate Merger Consideration shall be no more restrictive, taken as a whole,
than the conditions set forth in the Commitment Letter.

 



53 (e) If funds in the amounts set forth in the Commitment Letter, or any portion
thereof, become unavailable, Parent shall promptly notify the Company thereof
and shall use its reasonable best efforts to arrange and obtain in replacement
thereof, and negotiate and enter into financing commitments (if applicable)
and definitive agreements with respect to, alternative financing from the
same or alternative Financing Sources in an amount sufficient to consummate
the Merger and the transactions contemplated hereby (the " _Substitute
Financing_ "), upon terms and conditions (including pricing) not materially
less favorable, taken as a whole, to Parent than those in the Commitment
Letter, as promptly as practicable following the occurrence of such event;
_provided_ , _however_ , that the Substitute Financing shall not, without the
prior written consent of the Company, be subject to any additional or modified
conditions or other contingencies to the funding of the Financing than those
conditions contained in the Commitment Letter that would be
reasonably expected to materially delay or prevent the consummation of the
Merger and the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby. Upon
obtaining any commitment for any such Substitute Financing, for all purposes
under this Agreement, such Substitute Financing shall be deemed to be a part
of the "Financing," any commitment letter for such Substitute Financing shall
be deemed included in references to the "Commitment Letter," and any financing
institutions contemplated to provide such Substitute Financing shall be
deemed to be "Financing Sources."

(f) Notwithstanding anything contained in this Agreement to the contrary,
Parent expressly acknowledges and agrees that Parents and Merger Subs
obligation to hold the Closing and consummate the Merger are not conditioned
in any manner upon Parent or Merger Sub obtaining any Financing, and that,
for the avoidance of doubt, Parent and Merger Sub shall be required to hold
the Closing and consummate the Merger on any date so required pursuant to the
terms and conditions of Section 1.2, regardless of whether the Financing is
available.

contained in this Agreement to the contrary, Parent expressly acknowledges and
agrees that Parents and Merger Subs obligations to hold the Closing and
consummate the Merger and the transactions contemplated by this Agreement are

consummate the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement (regardless of whether, in the case of Parent, Parent has obtained
or received any proceeds of any Financing) on or prior to the third Business
Day after the applicable conditions to Closing set forth in Article VII have
been satisfied or waived (except for those conditions that by their nature or
terms are to be satisfied at the Closing, which conditions were capable of
being satisfied at the time of such failure to consummate the Merger)

 



60  shall constitute a Willful and Material Breach of this Agreement. The
parties acknowledge and agree that nothing in this Section 8.2 shall be deemed
to affect their right to specific performance under Section 9.10(c). In
addition, the parties agree that the terms of the Confidentiality Agreement
shall survive any termination of this Agreement pursuant to Section 8.1 in
accordance with its terms.

 

Section 8.3 _Termination Fee_.

 

(a) In the event that this Agreement is terminated by the Company pursuant to
Section 8.1(d)(ii), then, prior to or concurrently with, and as a condition
to the termination of this Agreement, the Company shall pay or cause to be
paid to Parent (or its designees) an amount in cash equal to $113,000,000 (the
" _Termination Fee_ ") by wire transfer of immediately available funds to an
account designated in writing by Parent.

(b) In the event that this Agreement is terminated by Parent pursuant
to Section 8.1(c)(ii) or Section 8.1(c)(iii), then the Company shall
promptly, but in no event later than two (2) Business Days after the date of
such termination, pay or cause to be paid to Parent (or its designees) the
Termination Fee by wire transfer of immediately available funds to an account
designated in writing by Parent.

(c) In the event that this Agreement is terminated:

(i) by Parent or the Company pursuant to Section 8.1(b)(i) or Section
8.1(c)(i) and an Acquisition Proposal was publicly proposed or announced by
any Person after the date of this Agreement and prior to such termination; or

 

(ii) by Parent or the Company pursuant to Section 8.1(b)(iii) and an
Acquisition Proposal was publicly proposed or announced by any Person after
the date of this Agreement and prior to such termination; and

(iii) in any such event, (A) the Company enters into a definitive agreement
with respect to any Acquisition Proposal within 12 months after such
termination of this Agreement or (B) the Company consummates any Acquisition
Proposal within 12 months after the termination of this Agreement, then, on
the date of entering into such definitive agreement (in the case of Clause
(A)), or consummating such Acquisition Proposal (in the case of Clause (B)),
the Company shall pay or cause to be paid to Parent (or its designees) the
Termination Fee by wire transfer of immediately available funds to an account
designated in writing by Parent. For purposes of this Section 8.3(c), each
reference to "20%" in the definition of "Acquisition Proposal" shall be
deemed to be a reference to "50%."

(d) The parties agree and understand that in no event shall the Company be
required to pay the Termination Fee on more than one occasion. Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary in this Agreement, if Parent receives the Termination
Fee from the Company pursuant to this Section 8.3, such payment shall be the
sole and exclusive remedy of Parent and Merger Sub against the Company and its
Subsidiaries and their respective former, current or future officers,
directors, partners, stockholders, managers, members, Affiliates and
Representatives and none of the Company, any of its Subsidiaries or any of
their respective former, current or future officers,

 



61  directors, partners, stockholders, managers, members, Affiliates or
Representatives shall have any further liability or obligation relating to or
arising out of this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby;
_provided_ , _however_ , that the foregoing shall not relieve the Company from
liability to Parent for any Willful and Material Breach of this Agreement by
the Company. In addition, notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this
Agreement, if Parent or Merger Sub receives any payments from the Company in
respect of any breach of this Agreement, and thereafter Parent receives the
Termination Fee under this Section 8.3, the amount of such Termination
Fee shall be reduced by the aggregate amount of any payments made by the
Company to Parent or Merger Sub in respect of any such breaches of this
Agreement. The parties acknowledge that the agreements contained in this
Section 8.3 are an integral part of the transactions contemplated hereby, and
that, without these agreements, the parties would not enter into this
Agreement, and that any amounts payable pursuant to this Section 8.3 do not
constitute a penalty. If the Company fails to pay when due any amount payable
pursuant to Section 8.3, then (i) the Company will reimburse Parent for all
reasonable costs and expenses (including reasonable legal fees and expenses)
incurred in connection with any action taken to collect such payment and in
connection with the enforcement by Parent of its rights under Section 8.3, and
(ii) the Company will pay to Parent interest on the overdue amount (for the
period commencing as of the date such overdue amount was originally required
to be paid and ending on the date such overdue amount is actually paid to
Parent in full) at a rate per annum equal to the "prime rate" (as published in
_The Wall Street Journal_ ) in effect on the date such overdue amount was
originally required to be paid.

Section 8.4 _Procedure for Termination_. Termination of this Agreement prior
to the Effective Time shall require action by the Board of Directors of
either Parent or the Company, as the case may be, but shall not require the
approval of the stockholders of the Company. A terminating party shall provide
written notice of termination to the other parties specifying the Section or
Sections pursuant to which such party is terminating the Agreement. If more
than one provision in Section 8.1 is available to a terminating party in
connection with a termination, a terminating party may rely on any or all
available provisions in Section 8.1 for any termination.

Section 9.3 _Interpretation; Construction_.

 

(a) When a reference is made in this Agreement to a Section, clause, Annex,
Exhibit or Section of a disclosure letter, such reference shall be to a
Section or clause of or Annex or Exhibit or Section of a disclosure letter to
this Agreement unless otherwise indicated. The table of contents and headings
contained in this Agreement are for reference purposes only and shall not
affect in any way the meaning or interpretation of this Agreement. The phrase
"the date of this Agreement" and terms of similar import, shall be deemed to
refer to the date first written above. Whenever the content of this Agreement
permits, the masculine gender shall include the feminine and neuter genders,
and a reference to singular or plural shall be interchangeable with the other.

 

(b) References to any agreement or contract are to that agreement or contract
as amended, modified or supplemented from time to time in accordance with the
terms hereof and thereof. References to any Person include the successors and
permitted assigns of that Person. References to any statute are to that
statute, as amended from time to time, and to the rules and
regulations promulgated thereunder. References to "$" and "dollars" are to
the currency of the United States. References from or through any date mean,
unless otherwise specified, from and including or through and including,
respectively. The words "hereby," "herein," "hereof," "hereunder" and words
of similar import refer to this Agreement as a whole (including any disclosure
letters delivered herewith) and not merely to the specific section, paragraph
or clause in which such word appears. Whenever the words "include," or
"includes" or "including" are used in this Agreement, they shall be deemed to
be followed by the words "without limitation." 

(c) The parties have participated jointly in negotiating and drafting this
Agreement. In the event that an ambiguity or a question of intent or
interpretation arises, this Agreement shall be construed as if drafted jointly
by the parties, and no presumption or burden of proof shall arise favoring or
disfavoring any party by virtue of the authorship of any provision of
this Agreement.

(d) No summary of this Agreement or any Exhibit attached hereto or Section of
a disclosure letter delivered herewith prepared by or on behalf of any party
shall affect the meaning or interpretation of this Agreement or any such
Exhibit or Section of a disclosure letter.

 



64 Section 9.4 _Counterparts; Effectiveness_. This Agreement may be executed in
any number of counterparts, including by facsimile or by email with .pdf
attachments, each of which shall be deemed to be an original but all of which
shall constitute one and the same instrument. This Agreement shall become
effective when each party has received counterparts thereof signed and
delivered (by electronic communication, facsimile or otherwise) by all of the
other parties.

 

Section 9.5 _Entire Agreement; No Third-Party Beneficiaries_.

 

(a) This Agreement, the Company Disclosure Letter, the Parent Disclosure
Letter, the Exhibit attached hereto and the Confidentiality
Agreement constitute the entire agreement, and supersede all prior
agreements, understandings, representations and warranties, both written and
oral, among the parties with respect to the subject matter hereof and thereof.

 

(b) This Agreement shall be binding upon and inure solely to the benefit of
each party except for: (i) only following the Effective Time, the provisions
of Article II shall inure to the benefit of, and be enforceable by, holders of
Company Common Stock, Company Options, Company RSU Awards and Company PSU
Awards, to the extent necessary to receive the consideration due to such
persons thereunder, (ii) the provisions of Section 6.8 shall inure to the
benefit of, and be enforceable by, the Indemnified Parties and (iii) the
provisions in the first sentence of Section 8.2 (Effect of Termination)
stating that the provisions of Article IX will survive the termination of
this Agreement, and the provisions of this clause (iii) of Section 9.5(b)
(Entire Agreement; No Third-Party Beneficiaries), Section 9.6 (Severability),
Section 9.8 (Modification or Amendment), Section 9.10 (Governing Law and
Venue; Waiver of Jury Trial; Specific Performance) and Section 9.13 (Liability
of Financing Sources) (such provisions, the " _Financing Source
Designated Provisions_ ") will inure to the benefit of the Financing Sources.

(c) The representations and warranties in this Agreement are the product of
negotiations among the parties and are for the sole benefit of the parties.
Any inaccuracies in such representations and warranties are subject to waiver
by the parties in accordance with Section 9.9 without notice or liability to
any other Person. In some instances, the representations and warranties in
this Agreement may represent an allocation among the parties of risks
associated with particular matters regardless of the Knowledge of any of the
parties. Consequently, Persons other than the parties may not rely upon the
representations and warranties in this Agreement as characterizations of
actual facts or circumstances as of the date of this Agreement or as of any
other date.

 

Section 9.6 _Severability_. If any term or other provision of this Agreement
is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced by any Law or public
policy, all other terms and provisions of this Agreement shall nevertheless
remain in full force and effect so long as the economic or legal substance of
the Merger or the other transactions contemplated hereby are not affected
in any manner materially adverse to any party. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
upon such determination that any term or other provision is invalid, illegal
or incapable of being enforced, the parties shall negotiate in good faith to
modify this Agreement so as to effect the original intent of the parties as
closely as possible in an acceptable manner in order that the Merger and the
other transactions contemplated hereby are consummated as originally
contemplated to the greatest extent possible.

 



65 Section 9.7 _Assignment_. Neither this Agreement nor any of the rights,
interests or obligations hereunder shall be assigned by any of the parties,
in whole or in part (whether by operation of law or otherwise), without the
prior written consent of the other parties, and any attempt to make any such
assignment without such consent shall be null and void, _provided_ , that
Parent and Merger Sub may assign their rights and obligations to any
Subsidiary of Parent, although no such assignment will relieve Parent or
Merger Sub, as the case may be, of any obligation so assigned. This Agreement
shall be binding upon, inure to the benefit of and be enforceable by the
parties and their respective successors and assigns.

 

Section 9.8 _Modification or Amendment_. This Agreement may be amended by the
parties (with respect to the Company and Merger Sub by action taken by their
respective Boards of Directors), at any time before or after adoption of this
Agreement by the stockholders of the Company, but, after any such adoption, no
amendment shall be made which by Law would require the further approval by
such stockholders without first obtaining such approval. This Agreement may be
modified or amended solely by written agreement executed and delivered by duly
authorized officers of the respective parties. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, the Financing Source Designated Provisions may not be amended in a
manner adverse to any Financing Sources without the written consent of such
Financing Source.

 

Section 9.9 _Extension; Waiver_. The conditions to each of the parties
obligations to consummate the Merger are for the sole benefit of such party
and may be waived by such party in whole or in part to the extent permitted by
applicable Laws. At any time prior to the Effective Time, the parties may (in
the case of the Company, by action taken or authorized by its Board
of Directors or authorized officers of the Company), to the extent permitted
by applicable Law, (a) extend the time for the performance of any of the
obligations or other acts of the other parties, (b) waive any inaccuracies in
the representations and warranties contained herein or in any document
delivered pursuant hereto and (c) waive compliance with any of the agreements
or conditions contained herein. Any agreement on the part of a party to any
such extension or waiver shall be valid only if set forth in a written
instrument signed on behalf of such party. The failure of any party to this
Agreement to assert any of its rights under this Agreement or otherwise shall
not constitute a waiver of such rights, nor shall any single or partial
exercise by any party to this Agreement of any of its rights under this
Agreement preclude any other or further exercise of such rights or any other
rights under this Agreement.

 

Section 9.10 _Governing Law and Venue; Waiver of Jury Trial; Specific
Performance_.

 

(a) This Agreement, and any dispute arising out of or relating to this
Agreement, shall be deemed to be made in and in all respects shall
be interpreted, construed and governed by and enforced in accordance with the
Laws of the State of Delaware without regard to the conflicts of laws rules
thereof.

 

(b) EACH PARTY ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES THAT ANY DISPUTE WHICH MAY ARISE UNDER
THIS AGREEMENT IS LIKELY TO INVOLVE COMPLICATED AND DIFFICULT ISSUES, AND
THEREFORE EACH SUCH PARTY HEREBY IRREVOCABLY AND UNCONDITIONALLY WAIVES ANY
RIGHT SUCH PARTY MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN RESPECT OF ANY LITIGATION
DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT, 

 



66  THE MERGER OR THE OTHER TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY. EACH PARTY
CERTIFIES AND ACKNOWLEDGES THAT (I) NO REPRESENTATIVE, AGENT OR ATTORNEY OF
ANY OTHER PARTY HAS REPRESENTED, EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE, THAT SUCH OTHER
PARTY WOULD NOT, IN THE EVENT OF LITIGATION, SEEK TO ENFORCE THE FOREGOING
WAIVER, (II) EACH PARTY UNDERSTANDS AND HAS CONSIDERED THE IMPLICATIONS OF
THIS WAIVER, (III) EACH PARTY MAKES THIS WAIVER VOLUNTARILY AND (IV) EACH
PARTY HAS BEEN INDUCED TO ENTER INTO THIS AGREEMENT BY, AMONG OTHER THINGS,
THE MUTUAL WAIVERS AND CERTIFICATIONS IN THIS SECTION 9.10.

 

(c) The parties acknowledge and agree that irreparable harm would occur for
which monetary damages would not be an adequate remedy in the event that any
of the provisions of this Agreement are not performed in accordance with their
specific terms or are otherwise breached. It is accordingly agreed that, in
the event of any breach or threatened breach by any other party of any
covenant or obligation contained in this Agreement, the non-breaching party
shall be entitled to (in addition to any other remedy that may be available to
it in law and equity, including monetary damages) (i) an injunction
restraining such breach or threatened breach and (ii) an Order of specific
performance to enforce the observance and performance of such covenant or
obligation (including the obligation of the parties to consummate the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the obligation of Parent and
Merger Sub to pay, and the Companys equity holders right to receive, the
aggregate consideration payable to them pursuant to the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, in each case in accordance with the terms and
conditions set forth in this Agreement) without proof of actual damages, and
each party further agrees to waive any requirement for the securing or posting
of any bond in connection with such remedy. Each party agrees not to raise any
objections (including any defense or counterclaim that there is an adequate
remedy in law) to the availability of the equitable remedy of specific
performance to prevent or restrain breaches or threatened breaches of, or to
enforce compliance with, the covenants and obligations of such party under
this Agreement all in accordance with the terms of this Section 9.10(c).

(d) Each of the parties (i) irrevocably submits itself to the personal
jurisdiction of each state or federal court sitting in the State of Delaware,
as well as to the jurisdiction of all courts to which an appeal may be taken
from such courts, in any suit, action or proceeding arising out of or
relating to this Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated hereby
(including any proceeding seeking equitable relief pursuant to Section
9.10(c)), (ii) agrees that every such suit, action or proceeding shall be
brought, heard and determined exclusively in the Court of Chancery of the
State of Delaware (or, only if the Delaware Court of Chancery declines to
accept jurisdiction over a particular matter, any state or federal court
within the State of Delaware), (iii) agrees that it shall not attempt to deny
or defeat such personal jurisdiction by motion or other request for leave from
such court, (iv) agrees not to bring any suit, action or proceeding arising
out of or relating to this Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated
herein in any other court and (v) waives any defense of inconvenient forum to
the maintenance of any suit, action or proceeding so brought. Each party
irrevocably consents to the service of process outside the territorial
jurisdiction of the courts referred to in this Section 9.10(d) in any such
action or proceeding by mailing copies thereof by registered or certified
United States mail, postage prepaid, return receipt requested, to its address
as specified in or pursuant to this Article IX. However, the foregoing shall
not limit the right of a party to effect service of process on the

 



67  other party by any other legally available method. Each of Parent, Merger
Sub and the Company agrees that a final judgment in any action or proceeding
in such court as provided above shall be conclusive and may be enforced in
other jurisdictions by suit on the judgment or in any other manner provided by
Law.

(e) Notwithstanding the provisions of this Section 9.10 and without limiting
the provisions of Section 9.13, the Company (i) agrees that it will not, and
will not permit its controlled Affiliates to, bring or support any Proceeding,
cause of action, claim, crossclaim or third-party claim of any kind or
description, whether in Law or in equity and whether in contract or in tort or
otherwise, against the Financing Sources in any way related to this Agreement
or any of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (including any
dispute arising out of or relating to the Financing or the performance
thereof) in any forum other than the United States District Court for the
Southern District of New York or the Supreme Court of the State of New York,
New York County, located in the Borough of Manhattan or, in either case, any
appellate court thereof, (ii) agrees that any such Proceeding will be governed
by the Laws of the State of New York, (iii) agrees to waive and hereby
waives, irrevocably and unconditionally, any right to a trial by jury in any
such Proceeding and (iv) agrees to waive and hereby waives, to the fullest
extent permitted by Law, any objection which such party may now or hereafter
have to the laying of venue of, and the defense of an inconvenient forum to
the maintenance of any such Proceeding in any such court.

 

Section 9.11 _Obligation of Parent and of the Company_. Whenever this
Agreement requires a Subsidiary of Parent to take any action, such
requirement shall be deemed to include an undertaking on the part of Parent to
cause such Subsidiary to take such action. Whenever this Agreement requires a
Subsidiary of the Company to take any action, such requirement shall be deemed
to include an undertaking on the part of the Company to cause such Subsidiary
to take such action and, after the Effective Time, on the part of the
Surviving Corporation to cause such Subsidiary to take such action.

 

Section 9.12 _No Recourse_. This Agreement may only be enforced by a party,
and any claims or causes of action that may be based upon, arise out of or
relate to this Agreement, or the negotiation, execution or performance of this
Agreement, may only be made by a party, against another party and no past,
present or future director, officer or employee of any party shall have any
liability to any party for any obligations or liabilities of a party or for
any claim (whether in tort, contract or otherwise) based on, in respect of, or
by reason of, the transactions contemplated hereby. Without limiting the
rights of any party against another party hereunder, in no event shall any
party or any of its Affiliates, and each party agrees not to and to cause its
Affiliates not to, seek to enforce this Agreement against, make any claims for
breach against, or seek to recover monetary damages from, any past, present
or future director, officer or employee of another party.

Section 9.13 _Liability of Financing Sources_. Notwithstanding anything to
the contrary contained herein, the Company agrees that it and its controlled

Certificate of Incorporation of Surviving Corporation

 

CERTIFICATE OF INCORPORATION

 

OF

CLARCOR INC. 

A STOCK CORPORATION

 

FIRST: The name of the corporation (the "Corporation") is:

 

CLARCOR Inc.

SECOND: The address of the Corporations registered office in the State of
Delaware is 1209 Orange Street, City of Wilmington, County of New Castle,
Delaware 19801. The name of the Corporations registered agent at such address
is The Corporation Trust Company.

THIRD: The purpose of the Corporation is to engage in any lawful act or
activity for which corporations may be organized under the General
Corporation Law of the State of Delaware (the "DGCL").

FOURTH: The total number of shares that the Corporation has authority to
issue is one hundred thousand (100,000) shares of Common Stock, par value of
$1.00 per share.

FIFTH: No director of the Corporation shall be liable to the Corporation or
its stockholders for monetary damages for breach of fiduciary duty as a
director, except for liability (i) for any breach of the directors duty of
loyalty to the Corporation or its stockholders, (ii) for acts or omissions
not in good faith or which involve intentional misconduct or a knowing
violation of law, (iii) under Section 174 of the DGCL, or (iv) for any
transaction from which the director derived an improper personal benefit. If
the DGCL is amended after approval by the stockholders of the Corporation of
this article to authorize corporate action further eliminating or limiting the
personal liability of directors, then the liability of a director of the
Corporation shall be eliminated or limited to the fullest extent permitted by
the DGCL, as so amended. Any repeal or modification of the foregoing paragraph
by the stockholders of the Corporation shall not adversely affect any right
or protection of a director of the Corporation existing at the time of such
repeal or modification.

SIXTH:

 

(a) Each person who was or is made a party or is threatened to be made a party
to or is involved in any action, suit or proceeding, whether civil, criminal,
administrative or investigative (hereinafter a "proceeding"), by reason of the
fact that he or she, or a person of whom he or she is the legal
representative, is or was a director or officer of the Corporation or is or
was serving at the request of the Corporation as a director, officer,
employee or agent of another Corporation or of a partnership, joint venture,
trust or other enterprise, including service with respect to employee benefit
plans, whether the basis of such proceeding is alleged action in an official
capacity as a director, officer, employee or agent or in any other capacity
while

 



A - 1  serving as a director, officer, employee or agent, shall be indemnified and
held harmless by the Corporation to the fullest extent authorized by the DGCL,
as the same exists or may hereafter be amended (but, in the case of any such
amendment, only to the extent that such amendment permits the Corporation to
provide broader indemnification rights than said law permitted the Corporation
to provide prior to such amendment), against all expense, liability and loss
(including attorneys fees, judgments, fines, ERISA excise taxes or penalties
and amounts paid or to be paid in settlement) reasonably incurred or suffered
by such person in connection therewith and such indemnification shall
continue as to a person who has ceased to be a director, officer, employee or
agent and shall inure to the benefit of his or her heirs, executors and
administrators; provided, however, that, except as provided in this
Article, the Corporation shall indemnify any such person seeking
indemnification in connection with a proceeding (or part thereof) initiated by
such person only if such proceeding (or part thereof) was authorized by the
board of directors of the Corporation (the "Board of Directors"). The right
to indemnification conferred in this Article shall be a contract right and
shall include the right to be paid by the Corporation the expenses incurred in
defending any such proceeding in advance of its final disposition; provided,
however, that, if the DGCL requires, the payment of such expenses incurred by
a director or officer in his or her capacity as a director or officer (and not
in any other capacity in which service was or is rendered by such person
while a director or officer, including, without limitation, service to an
employee benefit plan) in advance of the final disposition of a proceeding,
shall be made only upon delivery to the Corporation of an undertaking, by or
on behalf of such director or officer, to repay all amounts so advanced if it
shall ultimately be determined that such director or officer is not entitled
to be indemnified under this Article or otherwise. The Corporation may, by
action of its Board of Directors, provide indemnification to employees and
agents of the Corporation with the same scope and effect as the foregoing
indemnification of directors and officers.

 

(b) If a claim under this Article is not paid in full by the Corporation
within thirty days after a written claim has been received by
the Corporation, the claimant may at any time thereafter bring suit against
the Corporation to recover the unpaid amount of the claim and, if successful
in whole or in part, the claimant shall be entitled to be paid also the
expense of prosecuting such claim. It shall be a defense to any such action
(other than an action brought to enforce a claim for expenses incurred in
defending any proceeding in advance of its final disposition where the
required undertaking, if any is required, has been tendered to the
Corporation) that the claimant has not met the standards of conduct which make
it permissible under the DGCL for the Corporation to indemnify the claimant
for the amount claimed, but the burden of proving such defense shall be on
the Corporation. Neither the failure of the Corporation (including its Board
of Directors, independent legal counsel, or its stockholders) to have made a
determination prior to the commencement of such action that indemnification of
the claimant is proper in the circumstances because he or she has met the
applicable standard of conduct set forth in the DGCL, nor an actual
determination by the Corporation (including its Board of Directors,
independent legal counsel, or its stockholders) that the claimant has not met
such applicable standard of conduct, shall be a defense to the action or
create a presumption that the claimant has not met the applicable standard of
conduct.

 

(c) The right to indemnification and the payment of expenses incurred in
defending a proceeding in advance of its final disposition conferred in this
Article shall not be exclusive of any other right which any person may have or
hereafter acquire under any statute, provision of the Certificate of
Incorporation, bylaw, agreement, vote of stockholders or disinterested
directors or otherwise.

 



A - 2 (d) The Corporation may maintain insurance, at its expense, to protect itself
and any director, officer, employee or agent of the Corporation or another
corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise against any
such expense, liability or loss, whether or not the Corporation would have the
power to indemnify such person against such expense, liability or loss under
the DGCL.

SEVENTH: In furtherance and not in limitation of the rights, powers,
privileges, and discretionary authority granted or conferred by the DGCL or
other statutes or laws of the State of Delaware, the Board of Directors is
expressly authorized to make, alter, amend or repeal the bylaws of the
Corporation, without any action on the part of the stockholders, but the
stockholders may make additional bylaws and may alter, amend or repeal any
bylaw whether adopted by them or otherwise. The Corporation may in its bylaws
confer powers upon the Board of Directors in addition to the foregoing and in
addition to the powers and authorities expressly conferred upon the Board of
Directors by applicable law.

EIGHTH: The Corporation reserves the right at any time and from time to time
to amend, alter, change or repeal any provision contained in this Certificate
of Incorporation, and other provisions authorized by the laws of the State of
Delaware at the time in force may be added or inserted, in the manner now or
hereafter prescribed herein or by applicable law; and all rights, preferences
and privileges of whatsoever nature conferred upon stockholders, directors or
any other persons whomsoever by and pursuant to this Certificate of
Incorporation in its present form or as hereafter amended are granted subject
to this reservation.
