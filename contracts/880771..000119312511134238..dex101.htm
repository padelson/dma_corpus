(c) _Contingent Consideration Amount_. An additional amount of cash, payable

determined as follows:

(i) A " _Sales Revenue Earn-Out_ " shall be payable if Target achieves
certain target metrics based upon the sales revenue of Target for the sale of,
and sale commissions received for, the legacy products of Target acquired
hereby and listed on  _Schedule 2.1(c)_ hereto and subsequent additions
thereto as approved in accordance with the provisions of Section 2.1(e)(i)
herein (the " _Legacy Products_ ") as recognized under U.S. GAAP and as
determined (x) in Parents audited financial statements for the period
following the Closing to the end of fiscal year 2011, (y) in the Stub Sales
Revenue Certificate for the period beginning on January 1, 2011 through the
Closing (such period, the " _Stub Period_ ") without duplication of any
amounts in the foregoing clause and (z) in Parents audited financial
statements for fiscal year 2012 (such Target revenue for the combined years
2011 and 2012, the " _Cumulative Sales Revenue_ "), and shall be determined
as follows:

(A) If the Cumulative Sales Revenue is equal to or greater than Full Earn-Out
Revenue Target as set forth on _Schedule 2.1(c)_ (such amount, the " _Full
Earn-Out Revenue Target_ "), an aggregate cash amount equal to $11,500,000
shall be payable as the Sales Revenue Earn-Out.

 



2 (B) If the Cumulative Sales Revenue is at least equal to the Earn-Out Revenue
Floor as set forth on _Schedule 2.1(c)_ (calculated as 80% of the Full Earn-
Out Revenue Target; such amount, the " _Earn-Out Revenue Floor_ ") but less
than the Full Earn-Out Revenue Target, an aggregate cash payment between
zero and $11,500,000 shall be payable as the Sales Revenue Earn-Out, which
amount shall be calculated proportionally by interpolating between such
amounts by the portion of the Cumulative Sales Revenue in excess of the Earn-
Out Revenue Floor as compared to the Earn-Out Revenue Range as set forth on
_Schedule 2.1(c)_ (calculated as 20% of the Full Earn-Out Revenue Target;
such amount, the " _Earn-Out Revenue Range_ "), determined by multiplying
$11,500,000 by a quotient, the numerator of which is the portion of the
Cumulative Sales Revenue in excess the Earn-Out Revenue Floor and the
denominator which is the Earn-Out Revenue Range.

(C) If the Cumulative Sales Revenue is less than the Earn-Out Revenue Floor,
the amount of the Sales Revenue Earn-Out shall be zero.

For purposes of this Agreement, the " _Stub Sales Revenue Certificate_ " shall
mean a certificate delivered by Seller Representative to Parent sixty (60)
Business Days following the Closing setting forth the sales revenue of Target
for the Legacy Products during the Stub Period (the " _Stub Sales Revenue_ ").
The Stub Sales Revenue Certificate shall be certified by Seller Representative
as to the accuracy of such certificate as of the date of delivery. Parent
shall review the calculation of the Stub Sales Revenue as set forth on the
Stub Sales Revenue Certificate concurrently with the audit of its 2011 fiscal
year and shall, within thirty (30) Business Days following completion of the
audit of its financial statements for its 2011 fiscal year, provide to Seller
Representative a written confirmation of its agreement or disagreement with
the amount of Stub Sales Revenue provided in the Stub Sales Revenue
Certificate. If Parent shall disagree with the amount of Stub Sales Revenue
provided in the Stub Sales Revenue Certificate, Parent and Seller
Representative shall mutually review the matter and negotiate in good faith
for up to fifteen (15) Business Days (or such other period of time as the
parties mutually agree) to attempt to agree on the calculation of the Stub
Sales Revenue. If the parties are unable to agree on the calculation of Stub
Sales Revenue within the fifteen (15) Business Day period specified in the
preceding sentence, then the disputed portion(s) of such calculation shall be
immediately submitted to a firm of independent certified public accountants
mutually acceptable to Parent and Seller Representative for resolution, the
fees of which shall be borne in proportion to the extent Parent, on the one
hand, and Sellers, on the other hand, are found to be the "non-prevailing
party" as determined by such accounting firm. For purposes of the preceding
sentence, the extent to which Parent or Sellers are a "non-prevailing" party
shall be determined as a percentage, with (i) the numerator being (x) with
respect to Parent, the amount by which Parents calculation of the Stub Sales
Revenue is less than the amount determined by the firm of independent
certified public accountants and (y) with respect to Sellers, the amount by
which Seller Representatives calculation of the Stub Sales Revenue is
greater than the amount determined by the firm of independent certified public
accountants, and (ii) the denominator being the amount of Stub Sales Revenue
in dispute. In the event any partys percentage as a "non-prevailing party"
is greater than 100%, all of such fees shall be proportioned to such party.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the firm of independent certified public
accountants otherwise determines that the foregoing allocation
of responsibility for fees does not adequately address the dispute at issue
and the non-prevailing party cannot be adequately determined as such, then
such fees shall be borne equally by the parties. Any decision of such
accounting firm with respect to the disputed portion(s) of the calculation of
Stub Sales Revenue shall be final and binding on the parties hereto and may
not be submitted to arbitration. Sellers shall fully and promptly cooperate
with Parent in providing any information requested by Parent for review of
the Stub Sales Revenue, including any work papers utilized in determining the
Stub Sales Revenue.

 



3 (ii) An " _EBITDA Earn-Out_ " shall be payable if Parent achieves certain
target metrics based upon Parents Adjusted EBITDA as determined (x) in
Parents audited financial statements for fiscal year 2011, (y) in the Stub
EBITDA Certificate for the Stub Period without duplication of any amounts in
the foregoing clause and (z) in Parents audited financial statements for
fiscal year 2012 (such Adjusted EBITDA for the combined fiscal years 2011 and
2012, the " _Cumulative EBITDA_ "). For purposes of this Agreement, "
_EBITDA_ " shall mean the net income/(loss) as reflected in the Parents
audited financial statements, less interest, taxes, depreciation and
amortization as determined under U.S. GAAP as reflected in Parents audited
financial statements and " _Adjusted EBITDA_ " shall mean EBITDA as adjusted
by Parent each year to exclude from expenses the following: (a) Parents U.S.
research and development expenses (excluding any depreciation and
amortization already adjusted for); (b) any amounts paid by Parent as an
upfront licensing fee for new products which Parent or Target may decide to
sell or distribute after Closing; (c) any amounts attributable as share based
compensation expenses of Target for grants made to employees of Target for
post-Closing retention purposes; (d) any legal and forensic accounting costs
incurred and payable by Parent, any fines or penalties assessed against
Parent by any Governmental Authority and payable, or any settlement amounts
agreed to by Parent with any Governmental Authority and payable with respect
to the pending formal, non-public investigation being conducted by the U.S.
Securities and Exchange Commission (" _SEC_ "); (e) any legal, auditing or
financial advisor costs payable to third parties and incurred by Parent prior
to or on the date hereof for the acquisition contemplated under this
Agreement; (f) any legal, auditing or financial advisor costs payable to
third parties and incurred after the date hereof by Parent in connection with
any negotiation of any potential Parent Change in Control Transaction, in each
case as determined in Parents financial statement consolidation included in
the work papers utilized in Parents audited financial statements; and (g)
milestone payments that may be required to be paid in the Earn-Out Period by
Target to its partners for regulatory success, net of amounts amortized by
Parent. The EBITDA Earn-Out shall be determined as follows:

(A) If the Cumulative EBITDA is equal to or greater than the Full Earn-Out
EBITDA Target as set forth on _Schedule 2.1(c)_ (such amount the " _Full
Earn-Out EBITDA Target_ "), an aggregate cash amount equal to $11,500,000
shall be payable as the EBITDA Earn-Out.

(B) If the Cumulative EBITDA is at least equal to the Earn-Out EBITDA Floor as
set forth on  _Schedule 2.1(c)_ (calculated as eighty percent (80%) of the
Full Earn-Out EBITDA Target; such amount, the " _Earn-Out EBITDA Floor_ ") but
less than the Full Earn-Out EBITDA Target, an aggregate cash payment between
zero and $11,500,000 shall be payable as the EBITDA Earn-Out, which amount
shall be calculated proportionally by interpolating between such amounts by
the portion of the Cumulative EBITDA in excess of the Earn-Out EBITDA Floor as
compared to the Earn-Out EBITDA Range as set forth on _Schedule 2.1(c)_
(calculated as 20% of the Full Earn-Out EBITDA Target; such amount, the "
_Earn-Out EBITDA Range_ "), determined by multiplying $11,500,000 by a
quotient, the numerator of which is the portion of the Cumulative EBITDA in
excess of the Earn-Out EBITDA Floor and the denominator which is the Earn-Out
EBITDA Range.

(C) If the Cumulative EBITDA is less than the Earn-Out EBITDA Floor, the
amount of the EBITDA Earn-Out shall be zero.

 



4 (D) If the Cumulative EBITDA is greater than the Full Earn-Out EBITDA Target,
subject to Section 2.1(d), in addition to the amount payable under Section
2.1(c)(ii)(A), an additional amount between zero and $10,000,000 shall be
payable (as calculated, the " _EBITDA Overperformance Amount_ "), with
such amount calculated proportionally by interpolating between such amounts
by the portion of by which the Cumulative EBITDA exceeds the Full Earn-Out
EBITDA Target as compared to the Earn-Out EBITDA Range, determined by
multiplying $10,000,000 by a quotient, the numerator of which is the portion
of the Cumulative EBITDA in excess of the Full Earn-Out EBITDA Target and the
denominator which is the Earn-Out EBITDA Range. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
in the event the Cumulative EBITDA exceeds the Earn-Out EBITDA Cap as set
forth on _Schedule 2.1(c)_ (calculated as one hundred and twenty percent
(120%) of the Full Earn-Out EBITDA, such amount, the " _Earn-Out EBITDA Cap_
"), the EBITDA Overperformance Amount shall equal $10,000,000.

(E) For purposes of this Agreement, the " _Stub EBITDA Certificate_ " shall
mean a certificate delivered by Seller Representative to Parent sixty (60)
Business Days following the Closing setting forth Targets EBITDA in the Stub
Period (the " _Stub EBITDA_ "). The Stub EBITDA Certificate shall be
certified by Seller Representative as to the accuracy of such certificate as
of the date of delivery. Parent shall review the calculation of the Stub
EBITDA as set forth on the Stub EBITDA Certificate concurrently with the audit
of its 2011 fiscal year and shall, within thirty (30) Business Days following
completion of the audit of its financial statements for its 2011 fiscal year,
provide to Seller Representative a written confirmation of its agreement or
disagreement with the amount of Stub EBITDA provided in the Stub EBITDA
Certificate. If Parent shall disagree with the amount of Stub EBITDA provided
in the Stub EBITDA Certificate, Parent and Seller Representative shall
mutually review the matter and negotiate in good faith for up to fifteen (15)
Business Days (or such other period of time as the parties mutually agree) to
attempt to agree on the calculation of the Stub EBITDA. If the parties are
unable to agree on the calculation of Stub EBITDA within the fifteen (15)
Business Day period specified in the preceding sentence, then the disputed
portion(s) of such calculation shall be immediately submitted to a firm of
independent certified public accountants mutually acceptable to Parent and
Seller Representative for resolution, the fees of which shall be borne in
proportion to the extent Parent, on the one hand, and Sellers, on the other
hand, are found to be the "non-prevailing party" as determined by such
accounting firm. For purposes of the preceding sentence, the extent to which
Parent or Sellers are a "non-prevailing" party shall be determined as a
percentage, with (i) the numerator being (x) with respect to Parent, the
amount by which Parents calculation of the Stub EBITDA is less than the
amount determined by the firm of independent certified public accountants and
(y) with respect to Sellers, the amount by which Seller Representatives
calculation of the Stub EBITDA is greater than the amount determined by the
firm of independent certified public accountants, and (ii) the denominator
being the amount of Stub EBITDA in dispute. In the event any partys
percentage as a "non-prevailing party" is greater than 100%, all of such fees
shall be proportioned to such party. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the
firm of independent certified public accountants otherwise determines that the
foregoing allocation of responsibility for fees does not adequately address
the dispute at issue and the non-prevailing party cannot be adequately
determined as such, then such fees shall be borne equally by the parties. Any
decision of such accounting firm with respect to the disputed portion(s) of
the calculation of Stub EBITDA shall be final and binding on the parties
hereto. Sellers shall fully and promptly cooperate with Parent in providing
any information requested by Parent for review of the Stub EBITDA, including
any work papers utilized in determining the Stub Sales EBITDA.

Any amounts of Contingent Consideration determined as set forth above shall be
subject to modification set forth in paragraph (d) below and be paid in
accordance with Sections 2.2(c), 2.2(d), 2.2(e), 2.2(f) and 2.2(g) below.
Parents obligations to pay the Contingent Consideration shall be subject to
reduction pursuant to the right of set-off for any indemnification
obligations of Sellers as contemplated by Section 9 hereof.

Sales Revenue Earn-Out and the EBITDA Earn-Out pursuant to Sections 2.2(c)(i)
and 2.2(c)(ii), respectively, the amount of Contingent Consideration, if any,
payable to Sellers shall be increased by an amount of $10,000,000.

an amount of Initial Consideration would be reduced or would be repayable by
the Sellers as a result.

(e) _Earn-Out Resolution_.

 

(i) In the event that Sellers wish to add a product which Target has decided
to sell or distribute after the Closing to  _Schedule 2.1(c)(i)_ after the

Representative shall notify Parent in writing of such request, which
notification shall include (A) a confirmation that no upfront capital
investment, including any licensing fee, is payable for such Additional Legacy
Product, (B) five year detailed projections of earnings and cash flow along

added to _Schedule 2.1(c)(i)_ if Parent determines in good faith that (A)
such Additional Legacy Product requires no upfront capital investment,
including any licensing fee, payable by Parent, Purchaser or one of their
affiliates and (B) such Additional Legacy Product is gross profit neutral or
accretive to the gross profit margin of all the then-existing Category
I Legacy Products, taken as a whole, within one year of the addition. To the
extent Seller Representative and Parent are unable to reach agreement as to
the addition of the Additional Legacy Product to _Schedule 2.1(c)(i)_ after
good faith discussions, Seller Representative shall have a right to raise the
matter with a committee of Parents Board of Directors consisting of Messrs.
Peter Barrett, Gregg Lapointe and Jon Saxe (or such replacements on the
committee as may be reasonably agreed to between either Mr. Barrett or Seller
Representative, on the one hand, and Parent on the other hand), which shall
consider the matter in good faith.

(ii) In the event Parent operates the Targets business in a manner which
Sellers Representative believes would materially and negatively affect the
Contingent Consideration, Sellers Representative and the Chief Executive
Officer of Parent shall discuss the matter and whether any modifications
should be made to the Contingent Consideration as a result. To the extent
Sellers Representative and the Chief Executive Officer of Parent are unable
to resolve the matter after good faith discussions, Sellers Representative
shall have a right to raise the matter with a committee of Parents Board of
Directors consisting of Messrs. Peter Barrett, Gregg Lapointe and Jon Saxe
(or such replacements on the committee as may be reasonably agreed to between
either Mr. Barrett or Seller Representative, on the one hand, and Parent on
the other hand), which shall consider the matter in good faith.

 

(iii) Notwithstanding anything contrary in this Agreement, Parent shall have
the right to operate and manage Parents businesses and Targets businesses
as determined by Parent in its sole discretion.

June 30, 2012 or September 30, 2012, as the case may be, set forth on
_Schedule 2.2(d)(i)_ (calculated as 80% of the adjusted Full Earn-Out EBITDA
Target, with Cumulative EBITDA of Parent determined in accordance with Section
2.1(c)(ii), except that the periods used to determine Cumulative EBITDA shall
be the Stub Period and the Measurement Period only, and shall not be audited
unless audited financial statements for the respective period are
independently required.

 

(ii) For purposes of this Agreement:

(A) " _Earn-Out Period_ " shall mean the period commencing on the Closing Date
and ending on December 31, 2012.

 

(B) " _Measurement Period_ " means the period following the Closing through
the last full fiscal quarter of Parent prior the Acceleration Event.

(C) " _Parent Change in Control Transaction_ " means (1) the sale, lease,
license, or other disposition by Parent of all or substantially all of its
assets; or (2) Parents consolidation, merger or other reorganization with
another entity in which the holders of Parents outstanding voting
stock immediately prior to such transaction own, immediately after such
transaction, securities representing less than fifty percent (50%) of the
voting power of the successor entity, or, if the successor entity is wholly-
owned as a result of such transaction, the parent entity.

(iii) Any Sales Revenue Earn-Out or EBITDA Earn-Out payable under this Section
2.2(d) shall be due and payable as soon as practicable after the closing date
of the Acceleration Event, subject to offset for any Damages payable pursuant
to Section 9 hereof. To the extent Purchaser Indemnified Person has submitted
in good faith a Claim Notice pursuant to Section 9.5 to Seller Representative
with respect to a Claim which remains unresolved prior to date of payment of
any Sales Revenue Earn-Out or EBITDA Earn-Out, subject to Section 9.3, an
amount equal to the Damages claimed in the Claim Notice shall be withheld
from payment by Parent and set aside pending final resolution of the Claim
Notice, after which Parent shall release and pay any portions thereof which
are not offset for any Damages payable pursuant to Section 9\.

(e) _Contingent Consideration Payment upon Lotter Termination without Cause_.
In the event the Employment Agreement (defined below) and Mark Lotters
employment with Purchaser is terminated by Parent, Purchaser or its affiliates
without Cause (as defined in Section 2.2(g)(ii) below) prior to December 31,
2012, then as full and final settlement of the Contingent Payment amounts,
each of the Sales Revenue Earn-Out and the EBITDA Earn-Out shall be deemed to
equal $11,500,000, the EBITDA Overperformance Amount shall be deemed to
equal zero and no increase of Contingent Consideration under Section
2.1(d)(i) nor reduction under Section 2.1(d)(ii) shall take effect regardless
of whether the customer condition set forth in _Schedule 2.1(d)_ is achieved
or not achieved, such that the amount of Contingent Consideration payable
under this Agreement shall equal $23,000,000. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
in the event Mr. Lotters termination is for Cause or, if without Cause, is
approved by the majority of the members of a committee of Parents Board of
Directors consisting of Messrs. Peter Barrett, Gregg Lapointe and Jon Saxe (or
such replacements on the committee as may be reasonably agreed to between
either Mr. Barrett or Seller Representative, on the one hand, and Parent on
the other hand), the acceleration of the Contingent Payment provided for by
this paragraph shall not be triggered. For purposes of clarity, except for an
amendment that constitutes constructive or de facto termination of Mr.
Lotter, any amendment of the Employment Agreement or of Mr. Lotters
employment agreed to between Mr. Lotter and Parent shall in each case not
trigger the acceleration of the Contingent Payment provided for by this
paragraph. Any Contingent Consideration payable under this Section 2.2(e)
shall be due and payable as soon as practicable after the completion of the
2012 Audit, subject to offset for any Damages payable pursuant to Section
9 hereof. To the extent Purchaser Indemnified Person has submitted in good
faith a Claim Notice pursuant to Section 9.5 to Seller Representative with
respect to a Claim which remains unresolved prior to date of payment of any
Sales Revenue Earn-Out or EBITDA Earn-Out, subject to Section 9.3, an amount
equal to the Damages claimed in the Claim Notice shall be withheld from
payment by Parent and set aside pending final resolution of the Claim Notice,
after which Parent shall release and pay any portions thereof which are not
offset for any Damages payable pursuant to Section 9\.

 



9 (f) _Contingent Consideration Payment upon Failure of Board Appointment_. In
the event Parent is unable to comply in all material respects with the
requirements of Section 7.9 of this Agreement such that as a result, Sellers
are unable to effect the designation of Seller Nominees to Parents Board of
Directors during any time in the Earn-Out Period, then as full and final
settlement of the Contingent Payment amounts, each of the Sales Revenue Earn-
Out and the EBITDA Earn-Out shall be deemed to equal $11,500,000, the
EBITDA Overperformance Amount shall be deemed to equal zero and no increase
of Contingent Consideration under Section 2.1(d)(i) nor reduction under
Section 2.1(d)(ii) shall take effect regardless of whether the customer
condition set forth in  _Schedule 2.1(d)_ is achieved or not achieved.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the acceleration of the Contingent Payment
provided for by this paragraph shall not be triggered in the event Sellers do
not vote any shares of Parent Common Stock held or beneficially controlled by
them in favor of the election of Seller Nominees where such shares, had they
been voted in favor of Seller Nominees, would have otherwise resulted in the
election of Seller Nominees. Any Contingent Consideration payable under this
Section 2.2(f) shall be due and payable as soon as practicable after the
completion of the 2012 Audit, subject to offset for any Damages payable
pursuant to Section 9 hereof. To the extent Purchaser Indemnified Person has
submitted in good faith a Claim Notice pursuant to Section 9.5 to Seller
Representative with respect to a Claim which remains unresolved prior to date
of payment of any Sales Revenue Earn-Out or EBITDA Earn-Out, subject to
Section 9.3, an amount equal to the Damages claimed in the Claim Notice shall
be withheld from payment by Parent and set aside pending final resolution of
the Claim Notice, after which Parent shall release and pay any portions
thereof which are not offset for any Damages payable pursuant to Section 9\.

(g) _Deferred Contingent Consideration Payment_. 

(i) With respect to Mr. Mark Lotter, the payment and delivery of the
respective portion of any Contingent Consideration (the " _Deferred
Contingent Consideration_ ") that may otherwise become due and payable to his
holding company Spearing Limited under the terms of this Agreement shall be
automatically deferred until the fifth (5th) anniversary of the Closing Date
in the event Mr. Lotter ceases at any time after the Closing Date through the
date of payment of the Contingent Consideration to be an employee of Parent,
Purchaser or one of their affiliates, except as a result of such Mr. Lotters
death, disability or termination by Parent, Purchaser or one of their
affiliates without Cause, unless otherwise determined in writing by Parent in
its sole discretion. Any Deferred Contingent Consideration deferred pursuant
to this Section 2.2(g) shall accrue simple interest from the date on which the
Deferred Contingent Consideration was otherwise payable or deliverable
pursuant to Section 2.2(c), 2.2(d), 2.2(e) and 2.2(f) of this Agreement until
the date of delivery of such Deferred Contingent Consideration pursuant to
this Section 2.2(g), at the prime percentage rate as published by Silicon
Valley Bank in effect on the date such amount was otherwise deliverable
pursuant to Section 2.2(c), 2.2(d) 2.2(e) and 2.2(f) of this Agreement and
adjusted quarterly to the prime percentage rate as published by Silicon Valley
Bank and in effect on the last Business Day of each calendar quarter
thereafter until the date of delivery of such Deferred Contingent
Consideration pursuant to this Section 2.2(g). For the purposes of the
immediately foregoing sentence, the value of any Deferred Contingent
Consideration shall be calculated as of the date on which the Deferred
Contingent Consideration was otherwise deliverable pursuant to Section 2.2(c),
2.2(d), 2.2(e) and 2.2(f). Any such interest shall be paid in cash and shall
be paid only on or after the date on which Parent delivers the
Deferred Contingent Consideration to Mr. Lotter pursuant to this Section
2.2(g).

 



10 (ii) For purposes of this Agreement, " _Cause_ " means the occurrence of any
of the following: (A) theft, fraud, dishonesty, gross negligence or willful
misconduct by Mr. Lotter in connection with the performance of his duties
pursuant to his Employment Agreement; (B) a willful breach of the
material terms of his Employment Agreement by Mr. Lotter; (C) a material
failure to fulfill or perform his duties under his Employment Agreement, other
than due to illness or injury, which breach or failure is not cured to the
reasonable satisfaction of the Board of Directors of Parent within thirty
(30) days after written notice from the Board of Directors of Parent to Mr.
Lotter; (D) conviction of a felony or a crime or civil violation which
involves moral turpitude or would be considered harmful to the reputation or
goodwill of Parent, Purchaser, or any of its affiliates (or plea of guilty or
_nolo contendere_ ); (E) a repeated or ongoing failure to comply with the
reasonable directions and instructions of the Board of Directors of Parent in
connection with the performance of Mr. Lotters duties and responsibilities
hereunder following an initial notice of warning from the Board of Directors
of Parent with respect thereto (provided, however, that his performance of
duties as Seller Representative in itself, and not as an employee of Parent,
Purchaser or their affiliates, shall not constitute failure to comply with the
reasonable directions and instructions of the Board of Directors of Parent);
(F) use or possession of illicit drugs or abuse of alcohol, while performing
duties for Parent, Purchaser, or one of its affiliates or while on the
premises of Parent, Purchaser, or one of its affiliates; or (G) commission of
any act, or failure to act, in bad faith, which, in the reasonable
determination of the Board of Directors of Parent, in any material respect
impairs the reputation of, or in any material respect harms, Parent,
Purchaser, or one of its affiliates.

2.3 _Working Capital Adjustment to Purchase Price_.

 

(a) Not later than three (3) Business Days prior to the Closing, Target shall
provide Parent with an estimated balance sheet of Target as of the Closing
(the " _Estimated Closing Balance Sheet_ ") and a statement of the estimated
Closing Working Capital (as defined in Section 2.3(e) below) derived from the
Estimated Closing Balance Sheet (" _Estimated Closing Working Capital
Statement_ "), along with reasonable documentation supporting the calculation
of the estimated Closing Working Capital. The Estimated Closing Balance Sheet
and Estimated Closing Working Capital Statement shall be prepared by Target
in accordance with United States generally accepted accounting principles ("
_U.S. GAAP_ ") applied using the same accounting methods, practices,
principles, policies and procedures, with consistent classifications,
judgments and valuation and estimation and accrual methodologies that were
used in the preparation of the Financial Statements (as defined in Section 5.5
below) as if such Estimated Closing Balance Sheet and Estimated Closing
Working Capital Statement were being prepared as of a fiscal year end;
provided, however, that in the event there is a conflict between U.S. GAAP and
the classifications, judgments and valuation and estimation and
accrual methodologies that were used in the preparation of the Financial
Statements, the classifications, judgments and valuation and estimation and
accrual methodologies under U.S. GAAP shall be used in preparing the Estimated
Closing Balance Sheet and Estimated Closing Working Capital Statement.

(b) If the amount of Closing Working Capital as set forth on the Estimated
Closing Working Capital Statement is less than the Expected Working Capital
Amount, an amount equal to the shortfall by which the Closing Working Capital
as set forth on the Estimated Closing Working Capital Statement is less than
the Expected Working Capital Amount shall be deducted from the Cash Purchase
Price to be paid at Closing.

 



11 (c) Parent shall have sixty (60) Business Days following Closing to review
the calculation of the Closing Working Capital as set forth on the Estimated
Closing Working Capital Statement. Sellers shall fully and promptly cooperate
with Parent in providing any information requested by Parent for review of
the Estimated Closing Working Capital Statement. The calculation of the
Closing Working Capital as set forth on the Estimated Closing Working Capital
Statement shall have been deemed to have been accepted by Parent unless within
the sixty (60) Business Day period after Closing Parent shall deliver to
Seller Representative a balance sheet of Target as of the Closing (the "
_Revised Closing Balance Sheet_ ") and a statement of Closing Working Capital
derived from the balance sheet of Target as of the Closing (the " _Revised
Closing Working Capital Statement_ "). The Revised Closing Balance Sheet and
the Revised Closing Working Capital Statement shall be prepared in accordance
with U.S. GAAP applied using the same accounting methods, practices,
principles, policies and procedures, with consistent classifications,
judgments and valuation and estimation and accrual methodologies that were
used in the preparation of the Financial Statements as if such Revised
Closing Balance Sheet was being provided to auditors in connection with a
fiscal year end; provided, however, that in the event there is a conflict
between U.S. GAAP and the classifications, judgments and valuation
and estimation and accrual methodologies that were used in the preparation of
the Financial Statements, the classifications, judgments and valuation and
estimation and accrual methodologies under U.S. GAAP shall be used preparing
the Revised Closing Balance Sheet and the Revised Closing Working Capital
Statement. Upon Parents delivery of the Revised Closing Balance Sheet and the
Revised Closing Working Capital Statement to Seller Representative, the
parties will mutually review the matter and negotiate in good faith for up to
fifteen (15) Business Days (or such other period of time as the parties
mutually agree) to attempt to agree on the calculation of Closing Working
Capital. If the parties are unable to agree on the calculation of Closing
Working Capital within the fifteen (15) Business Day period specified in the
preceding sentence, then the disputed portion(s) of such calculation shall be
immediately submitted to a firm of independent certified public accountants
mutually acceptable to Parent and Seller Representative for resolution, the
fees of which shall be shared equally between Parent, on the one hand, and
Sellers collectively, on the other hand. Any decision of such accounting firm
with respect to the disputed portion(s) of the calculation of Closing Working
Capital shall be final and binding on the parties hereto.

(d) No later than five (5) Business Days following the final determination of
Closing Working Capital in accordance with Section 2.3(c) above, the Cash
Purchase Price shall be adjusted as provided herein to reflect the Closing
Working Capital determined. If the Closing Working Capital as finally
determined is greater than the amount equal to the Expected Working Capital
Amount less the amount, if any, of any shortfall previously deducted from the
Cash Purchase Price in accordance with Section 2.3(b) above, then (i) the
amount by which the Closing Working Capital Amount exceeds such amount shall
each be added to the Purchase Price and (ii) Parent shall pay to Sellers, or
cause Purchaser or one of its affiliates to pay to Sellers, an aggregate
amount of such excess in accordance with Sellers Pro-rata Interests along
with release of the Working Capital Escrow Amount. For purposes of this
Agreement, " _Pro-rata Interest_ " shall mean the percentage interest equal
to the number of Shares held by Seller immediately prior to Closing divided by
the aggregate number of Shares outstanding immediately prior to Closing,
which percentage shall be set forth across each Sellers name in the
Allocation Schedule under the column entitled "Pro-rata Interest". If the
Closing Working Capital as finally determined is less than the amount equal to
the Expected Working Capital Amount less the amount, if any, of any shortfall
previously deducted from the Cash Purchase Price in accordance with Section
2.3(b) above, then the amount of shortfall shall be paid to Parent (or if
Purchaser shall otherwise determine, to Purchaser or one of its affiliates)
out of the Working Capital Escrow Amount in accordance with Sellers Pro-rata
Interests. In the event that the portion of the Working Capital Escrow Amount
that is remaining after any payments owed to Parent pursuant to Section
2.3(c) have been made is insufficient to cover the amount owed to Parent
pursuant to this Section 2.3(d), such shortfall shall be paid by Sellers, in
accordance with each Sellers Pro-rata Interest of such shortfall amount, to
Parent (or if Purchaser shall otherwise determine, to Purchaser or one of its
affiliates) within ten (10) Business Days after final determination. In the
event the full amount owing to Parent is not paid within such ten (10)
Business Day period, Parent shall have a right to satisfy such amount at its
sole discretion out of the Indemnification Escrow Amount, which payment shall
be apportioned in accordance with each Sellers Pro-rata Interest of
the Indemnification Escrow Amount.

 



12 (e) For purposes of this Section 2.3:

 

(i) " _Closing Working Capital_ " means (A) the Included Current Assets of
Target less (B) the Included Current Liabilities of Target, determined as of
the Closing.

(ii) " _Expected Working Capital Amount_ " means $8,000,000; provided,
however, that

(A) any amounts of the following audit-related fees shall not be included in
the Included Current Liabilities of Target regardless of their accounting
treatment under U.S. GAAP: (1) if Parent elects to have Target continue with
the completion of the preparation of audited financial statements for Targets
fiscal years 2009 and 2010 using Targets current firm of independent
certified public accountants, any incremental fees incurred or to be incurred
by Target to such firm for the audits of the fiscal years 2009 and 2010 as
conducted by such firm which are solely a result of Parents requirement for
an unqualified audit opinion for the accounting for share based reserves
(provided, however, that any non-incremental fees incurred or to be incurred
shall be accrued in the Included Current Liabilities), or (2) if Parent
elects to have Target continue with the completion of the preparation of
audited financial statements for Targets fiscal years 2009 and 2010 with a
separate firm of independent certified public accountants as chosen by Parent
in its sole discretion, all fees incurred by Target to such firm for the
audits of the fiscal years 2009 and 2010 as conducted by such firm. Target
shall proceed with any engagement as so elected by Parent, which election
shall be made by Parent in its sole discretion.

(B) any amounts of Targets pre-paid liabilities existing at Closing
for previous in-licensed product payments shall be included in the Included
Current Assets of Target in a manner consistent with the manner accounted for
in Targets Financial Statements regardless of their accounting treatment
under U.S. GAAP. 

(iii) " _Included Current Assets_ " means cash, cash equivalents, short-term
investments, accounts receivable, net, other receivables and pre-paid
expenses to the extent recognized by Parent under U.S. GAAP of Target due
within one year; provided, however, Included Current Assets shall not include
any deferred tax assets.

 

(iv) " _Included Current Liabilities_ " means notes payable, accounts payable,
accruals and other liabilities, and other payables of Target as of the type
historically included in Targets Financial Statements; provided, however,
Included Current Liabilities shall not include any amounts to be paid for the
Option Repurchase Amount nor any deferred tax liabilities.

 



13 2.4 _Escrow and Adjustment Payments_. The portion of the Initial
Consideration otherwise to be paid to Sellers at Closing shall be reduced by
(i) an amount equal to fifteen percent (15%) of the Cash Purchase Price and
fifteen percent (15%) of the Share Purchase Price (the " _Indemnification
Escrow Amount_ "), which Indemnification Escrow Amount shall be held in
escrow by the Escrow Agent pursuant to the terms of the Escrow Agreement for
the period beginning on the Closing Date and ending on the date that is
eighteen (18) months after the Closing Date (the " _Survival Period_ ") to
satisfy any claims by Purchaser for indemnification pursuant to Section 9
hereof, and (ii) an amount equal $500,000 (the " _Working Capital Escrow
Amount_ "), which Working Capital Escrow Amount shall be held in escrow by the
Escrow Agent pursuant to the terms of the Escrow Agreement to satisfy any
amounts owed by Sellers to Purchaser pursuant to Section 2.3(d) hereof. The
Indemnification Escrow Amount and the Working Capital Escrow Amount shall be
escrowed by Sellers in proportion to each Sellers Pro-Rata Interest, as set
forth under the captions "Indemnification Escrow Amount" and "Working Capital
Escrow Amount" set forth next to such Sellers name on the Allocation
Schedule. Within ten (10) Business Days of the final determination of the
Closing Working Capital in accordance with Section 2.3(c), the portion of
the Working Capital Escrow Amount and accrued interest remaining after
satisfaction of amounts owed to Parent, Purchaser or one of their affiliates
pursuant to Section 2.3(d) hereof (if any) shall be released from the escrow
and delivered to each Seller or such Sellers representative in accordance
with each Sellers Pro-rata Interest. Within ten (10) Business Days after the
date that is twelve (12) months after the Closing Date, 50% of the
Indemnification Escrow Amount and accrued interest remaining after
satisfaction of claims (if any) made in accordance with Section 9.4 and
Section 9.5 prior to the date that is twelve (12) months after the Closing
Date, if any, shall be released from escrow and delivered to such Seller;
_provided_ , _however_ , should any indemnification claim made prior to the
date that is twelve (12) months after the Closing Date fail to reach final
determination and satisfaction prior to the date that is twelve (12) months
after the Closing Date, a portion of the 50% of the Indemnification Escrow
Amount and accrued interest remaining that would otherwise be released
pursuant to the foregoing that the parties reasonably determine in good
faith as sufficient to satisfy 50% of all amounts with respect to such
indemnification claim shall be retained in escrow pending final resolution of
such claim in accordance with the provisions of the Escrow Agreement. Within
ten (10) Business Days after the expiration of the Survival Period, the
Indemnification Escrow Amount and accrued interest remaining after
satisfaction of claims made in accordance with Section 9.4 and Section 9.5
prior to the expiration of the Survival Period pursuant to the immediately
preceding sentence, if any, shall be released from escrow and delivered to
such Seller; _provided_ , _however_ , should any indemnification claim made
prior to the expiration of the Survival Period fail to reach final
determination and satisfaction prior to the expiration of the Survival Period,
a portion of the Indemnification Escrow Amount that the parties reasonably
determine in good faith as sufficient to satisfy all amounts with respect to
such indemnification claim shall be retained in escrow pending final
resolution of such claim in accordance with the provisions of the Escrow
Agreement.

2.5 _Payment of Transfer Taxes and Fees_. All transfer, documentary, sales,
use, stamp and registration taxes, and all conveyance fees, recording charges
and other fees and charges (including any penalties and interest) incurred in
connection with the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, shall be borne equally by Sellers on the one hand and Purchaser on
the other hand.

 

2.6 _Payment of Other Amounts at Closing_. Simultaneous with the payment of
the Cash Purchase Price and Share Purchase Price at Closing, each of each of
the following shall be paid or repaid pursuant to the Allocation Schedule: (i)
the Option Repurchase Amount, (ii) the aggregate amount of Target Transaction
Expenses set forth on the Closing Transaction Expense Certificate and (iii)
any Outstanding Debt Amount (including without limitation the premium amount
payable under the terms of the Notes).

3\. _Closing_. Subject to the satisfaction or waiver of all closing actions
and deliveries set forth in this Agreement, the consummation of the purchase
and sale of the Shares (the " _Closing_ ") shall take place on the close of
business on the date hereof at the offices of Maples and Calder in the Cayman
Islands (the date on which the Closing occurs is referred to herein as the "
_Closing Date_ ").

 



14 4\. _Representations and Warranties of Sellers_. Each Seller represents and
warrants to Purchaser, severally and not jointly with other Sellers and as to
such Seller itself that the statements contained in this Section 4 are true
and correct.

4.1 _Authority and Binding Obligation_. Such Seller has all requisite power

16 5\. _Representations and Warranties of Target_. Target represents and warrants
to Purchaser that the statements contained in this Section 5 are true and

Schedule will be arranged in paragraphs corresponding to the numbered and
lettered paragraphs contained in this Section 5 and Section 4, and the
disclosure in any such numbered and lettered Section of the Disclosure
Schedule shall qualify only the corresponding subsection in this Section 5 and
Section 4, provided, however, that such disclosure shall also be deemed to
qualify each other subsection of this Section 5 and Section 4 to the extent
that it is reasonably apparent that such disclosure is responsive to such
other subsection without any independent knowledge on the part of the reader

beneficially or of record, at least 50% of the outstanding equity interests of
such entity.

 

5.1 _Organization and Qualification_. Each of Target and its Subsidiaries is a
legal entity duly organized, validly existing and, where applicable, in good

reasonably determined by Parent, no further U.S. based research and
development shall be pursued by Parent during Parents fiscal years 2011 and
2012. However, if the SCV-07 Phase II trial is successful and the SCV-07 asset
demonstrates strategic value to Parent or its Subsidiaries, as may be
reasonably determined by Parent, Parent shall pursue further development
through a self-funding model where no further material funding from Parent
will be required. Furthermore, Parent intends that such SCV-07 asset will be
available also for PRC-based development.

determination by Parent of any Contingent Consideration payable (or
determination that no Contingent Consideration is payable), in connection with
any annual or special meeting of the stockholders of Parent called for the
purpose of electing the members of the Board of Directors during such period,
or whenever members of the Board of Directors are elected by written consent,
Sellers shall be entitled, but not obligated, to nominate by written notice to
Parent individual(s) (" _Seller Nominees_ ") for membership to Parents Board
of Directors to occupy up to two seats on Parents Board of Directors (it
being understood that if the identities of such nominees are different than
the previous persons nominated by Sellers, Sellers shall cause their current
Board representative(s) to resign from Parents Board of Directors in
connection with such nomination). Subject to the satisfaction of all legal and
governance requirements regarding service as a director of Parent and to the
reasonable approval of Parents Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee
(" _Governance Committee_ ") (such approval not to be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed) (all such requirements and approval, " _Board
Membership Qualifications_ "), Parent shall, subject to the fiduciary duties
of its Board of Directors, recommend to its stockholders the election of
Seller Nominees at the applicable annual or special meeting.

individual to the same extent as it does for any of its other nominees to the
Board of Directors.

 

(b) The Sellers shall have the power to designate a replacement for any Seller
Nominee upon the death, resignation, retirement, disqualification or removal
from office of a director currently serving as Seller Nominee, as the case may
be, subject to satisfaction of all Board Membership Qualifications and the
fiduciary duties of Parents Board of Directors. Parents Board of Directors
will promptly take all action reasonably required to fill the vacancy
resulting therefrom with such individual (including (i) such individual,
subject to applicable law, being Parents and the Governance Committees
nominee to serve on the Board of Directors, (ii) using reasonable best efforts
to have such individual elected as director of Parent and (iii) Parent
soliciting proxies for such individual to the same extent as it does for any
of its other nominees to the Board of Directors), subject to its applicable
fiduciary duties.

 



38 (c) Sellers shall cause each such Seller Nominee nominated or designated
by Sellers in accordance with this Section to tender his or her voluntary
resignation from the Board of Directors prior to settlement and payment of the
Contingent Consideration pursuant to the provisions of Section 2.2 hereunder
(or determination by Parent that no Contingent Consideration is payable), to
be effective upon the later of settlement and payment of the Contingent
Consideration (or determination by Parent that no Contingent Consideration is
payable) or upon acceptance by Parents Board of Directors, which resignation
shall be subject to consideration by Parents Board of Directors for
acceptance, in which case such Seller Nominee would cease to continue as a
member of the Board of Directors of Parent, or declination, in which case the
Seller Nominee may be asked to continue as a member of the Board of Directors
of Parent.

(d) In the event that any Seller Nominee is not elected to Parents Board of
Directors by the stockholders of Parent at any election of directors held
during period from the Closing through the date of determination by Parent of
any Contingent Consideration payable (or determination that no Contingent
Consideration is payable), then, subject to the fiduciary duties of Parents
Board of Directors, Parent shall promptly thereafter, and in any event prior
to the 30 calendar day period after the failure of Parents stockholders to
elect such persons to Parents Board of Directors, appoint to Parents Board
of Directors two nominees of Sellers to serve as Seller Nominees. Sellers
shall use reasonable discretion to ensure that any Seller Nominee designated
for election or appointment hereunder has the appropriate business experience
and background such that Parents Board of Directors is able to in good
faith nominate or appoint such individual to Parents Board of Directors in a
manner consistent with the fiduciary duties of Parents Board of Directors.
Sellers shall cooperate with Parent in any proposed designee for Parents
Board of Directors and shall furnish to Parent any and all information
reasonably required to facilitate the election or appointment of Seller
Nominees to Parents Board of Directors, with the identification and
information about any alternative Seller Nominee to be appointed in the 30
calendar day period after any failure of Parents stockholders to elect such
persons to Parents Board of Directors to be provided to Parent no later than
fifteen days prior to the end of the 30 calendar day period.

7.10 _Standstill_. Each Seller hereby agrees that for so long as they hold any

or cause or participate in, or in any way assist any other Person to effect,

each case to the extent such Shares are eligible to so vote), in connection
with any election or removal of directors for a slate of directors which names
more than two (2) directors nominated by or affiliated with either Sellers,
any current or previous affiliate of any Seller or any current or previous
affiliate of Target.

directors, officers, employees or agents), directly or indirectly, to amend or
waive any provision of this Section 7.10 (including this sentence).

7.11 _Registration Statement_. Parent shall use its reasonable best efforts to
cause the shares of Parent Common Stock issued pursuant to Section 2.1(b)

combination of units or shares, recapitalization, merger, consolidation or
other reorganization, the " _Registrable Securities_ ") to be registered under

therewith shall use its reasonable best efforts to prepare and file a
registration statement (the " _Registration Statement_ ") with the SEC with
respect to the Registrable Securities as soon as practicable after the
Closing Date and shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause the
Registration Statement to become effective prior to the expiration of the
Lock-Up Period; _provided_ , _however_ , that each holder of Registrable
Securities (" _Holder_ ") shall provide all such information and materials to
Parent and take all such action as may be necessary in order to permit Parent
to comply with all applicable requirements of the SEC and to obtain any
desired acceleration of the effective date of such Registration Statement.
Such provision of information and materials is a condition precedent to the
obligations of Parent pursuant to this Section 7.11. In addition, in the
event Parent is unable to file a Form 8-K including any required financial
statements of Target within the 71 calendar day period after which the initial
Form 8-K is required to be filed for the consummation of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement and such failure to timely file is due to the
failure of Parent and Target to complete any audited financial statements of
Target required to be filed, then the Registration Statement shall not be
required to become effective prior to the expiration of the Lock-Up Period
but only at such time as may be reasonable practicable thereafter and 50% of
the fees and costs incurred for Parents Form S-1 registration statement shall
be shared by Sellers and deducted from the Indemnification Escrow Amount.
Parent shall not be required to effect more than one (1) registration under
this Section 7.11. The offering made pursuant to such registration shall not

compliance by Holders with the provisions thereof) or (ii) eighteen (18)
months after the Closing, subject to Section 7.11(b); (ii) prepare and file
with the SEC such amendments and supplements to the Registration Statement and
the prospectus used in connection therewith as may be necessary, and comply
with the provisions of the Securities Act with respect to the sale or other
disposition of all securities proposed to be registered in the Registration
Statement until the termination of effectiveness of the Registration
Statement; and (iii) for so long as Parent is required to cause the
Registration Statement to remain effective, furnish to each Holder such
number of copies of any prospectus (including any preliminary prospectus and
any amended or supplemented prospectus) as required by the Securities Act, and
such other documents as each Holder may reasonably request in order to effect
the offering and sale of the shares of Registrable Securities to be offered
and sold.

 



40 (b) _Suspension of Effectiveness_. Notwithstanding any other provision of
this Section 7.11, Parent shall have the right at any time to require that all
Holders suspend open market offers and sales of Registrable Securities
whenever, and for so long as, in the reasonable, good-faith judgment of Parent
after consultation with counsel, there is in existence material undisclosed
information or events with respect to Parent (the " _Suspension Right_ "). In
the event Parent exercises the Suspension Right, such suspension will
continue for the period of time reasonably necessary for disclosure to occur
at a time that is not materially detrimental to Parent or until such time as
the information or event is no longer material, each as reasonably determined
in good faith by Parent after consultation with counsel. Parent will promptly
give the Seller Representative notice, in a writing signed by an executive
officer of Parent, of any such suspension (the " _Suspension Notice_ ").
Parent agrees to notify the Seller Representative promptly upon termination
of the suspension (the " _Resumption Notice_ "). Upon receipt of either a
Suspension Notice or Resumption Notice, Parent shall immediately notify each
Holder concerning the status of the Registration Statement. The period during
which Parent is required to cause the Registration Statement to remain
effective shall be extended by a period equal in length to any and all periods
during which open market offers and sales of Registrable Securities are
suspended pursuant to exercise of the Suspension Right.

(c) _Expenses_. Except as set forth in the first paragraph of this Section
7.11, Parent shall pay all of the out-of-pocket expenses incurred in
connection with the registration of Registrable Securities pursuant to this
Section 7.11, including all registration and filing fees, exchange listing
fees, printing expenses, transfer agents and registrars fees, the fees and
disbursements of Parents outside counsel and independent accountants. Sellers
shall be responsible for any fees or disbursements of their own counsel
incurred in connection with the registration of Registrable Securities
pursuant to this Section 7.11.

7.12 _Further Assurances_. From time to time, at Parent and Purchasers
request, whether on or after the Closing Date and without further
consideration, each Seller shall execute and deliver or cause to be executed
and delivered such further instruments of conveyance and transfer and take
such other action as Parent and Purchaser reasonably may require more
effectively to convey and transfer to Parent and Purchaser title to the Shares
and to effectuate the transactions contemplated hereby. From time to time
after the Closing, at Targets request, whether on or after the Closing Date
and without further consideration, Parent and Purchaser shall take such action
(including, without limitation, executing and delivering documents) as Target
reasonably may require more effectively to effectuate the transactions
contemplated hereby.

in good faith pertaining to the inaccuracy in, breach or violation of or
default under such representation or warranty (which notice shall contain all
information required of a Claim Notice (as defined and described in Section
9.5(a)), then, subject to the other provisions of this Section 9, such claim
shall survive termination of such representation or warranty indefinitely
until such claim is finally resolved. The same principle shall apply with
respect to indemnity claims made by Sellers against Parent and Purchaser in
connection with breach of the representations and warranties of the
Parent and Purchaser prior to the day of termination of such representation
or warranty. Except as expressly provided in this Section 9.1(b), upon
termination of any particular representation or warranty contained in this
Agreement, no party shall be entitled to recover any relief (including,
without limitation, any Damages) resulting from, arising out of or incurred
with respect to any inaccuracy in, breach or violation of or default under
such terminated representation or warranty.

 

(c) All covenants and agreements under this Agreement shall survive until
fully performed, unless limited by their terms or purpose.

9.2 _Indemnification_.

 

(a) _Liability of an Individual Seller with respect to its Representations and
Warranties and Other Matters_. Each Seller shall severally and not jointly
with other Sellers indemnify and shall hold Parent, Purchaser and their
officers, directors, agents, attorneys and employees, and each Person, if any,
who controls or may control Purchaser (individually a " _Purchaser
Indemnified Person_ " and collectively the " _Purchaser Indemnified Persons_
") harmless from and against any actual liability, loss, cost, expense, claim,
lien or other damage, including, without limitation, reasonable attorneys
fees and expenses (all of the foregoing items for purposes of this Agreement
are referred to as " _Damages_ "), resulting from, arising out of or incurred
with respect to:

 

(i) any misrepresentation or breach or default of any representation or
warranty of such Seller given or made by such individual Seller herein or in
any certificate or schedule delivered pursuant hereto at the Closing;

(ii) any failure of such Seller to perform or observe any covenant or
agreement contained herein on the part of such individual Seller to be
performed or observed; or

(iii) Parent or Purchasers enforcement of their rights under this Section
9.2(a).

 



44 (b) _Liability of an Individual Seller with respect to Target
s Representations and Warranties and Other Matters_. In addition to the
indemnification provided in Section 9.2(a) above, subject to the limitations
set forth in this Section 9, each Seller (as defined below) shall severally
and not jointly with other Sellers indemnify and shall hold Purchaser
Indemnified Persons harmless from and against any Damages resulting from,
arising out of or incurred with respect to:

 

(i) any misrepresentation or breach or default of any representation or
warranty given or made by Target herein or in any certificate or schedule
delivered pursuant hereto at the Closing;

(ii) any failure of Target to perform or observe any covenant or agreement
contained herein on the part of Target to be performed or observed;

(iii) any amounts required to be refunded to Parent and Purchaser under
Section 2.3;

(iv) any understatement of the Outstanding Debt Amount as set forth in
Target Outstanding Debt Certificate;

(v) any Indemnifiable Transaction Expenses;

 

(vi) any " _Covered Matter_ " listed on _Schedule 9.2(b)(vi)_;

 

(vii) any inaccuracies or disputes resulting from Sellers allocation under
the Allocation Schedule; or

 

(viii) Parent or Purchasers enforcement of their rights under this Section
9.2(b).

 

Sellers indemnification obligations under this Section 9.2(b) of this
Agreement shall be in accordance with their Pro-rata Interests and as set
forth across each Sellers name in the Allocation Schedule under the column
entitled "Pro-Rata Interests".

 

For all breaches or defaults of any Sellers representations, warranties,
covenants or agreements or with respect to any other matter for which
indemnification is provided for under Section 9.2(a), the indemnification
obligations of each Seller to the Purchaser Indemnified Persons shall be
several and not joint and shall be specific to the Seller in breach or
default of any representations, warranties, covenants or agreements. For all
breaches or defaults of Targets representations, warranties, covenants or
agreements or with respect to any other matter for which indemnification is
provided for under Section 9.2(b), the indemnification obligations of Sellers
to the Purchaser Indemnified Persons shall also be several and not joint, with
liability of each Sellers to be apportioned based upon each Sellers Pro-rata
Interests. Subject always to Section 9.3 below, in order to fulfill the
obligations of any Seller pursuant to Sections 9.2(a) or 9.2(b), Damages owed
to Purchaser Indemnified Persons shall be paid: (i) first, out of any cash or
shares of Parent Common Stock held as the Indemnification Escrow Amount of
such Seller, at Sellers election; and (ii) second out of the amounts payable
to any such Seller as Contingent Consideration under Section 2 hereof as a
right of set-off against such amounts; and in the event (A) any Damages to
Purchaser Indemnified Persons exceed the amount of the Indemnification Escrow
Amount or amounts payable to a Seller as Contingent Consideration under
Section 2 hereof or (B) arise after the payment of the Contingent
Consideration or release of the Indemnification Escrow Amount, such amounts
shall be paid by such Seller directly from any proceeds actually received by
such Seller. For purposes of satisfying any indemnification claim for Damages
hereunder, the value of Parent Common Stock shall be the then-current market
value of the Parent Common Stock at the close of market on the date of
resolution of such indemnifiable claim. Should any indemnification claim made
prior to the expiration of the Survival Period fail to reach final
determination and satisfaction prior to the expiration of the Survival Period,
a portion of the Indemnification Escrow Amount that the parties reasonably
determine in good faith as sufficient to satisfy all amounts with respect to
such indemnification claim shall be retained in escrow pending final
resolution of such claim in accordance with the provisions of the Escrow
Agreement.

 



45 (c) _Parent and Purchaser s Indemnification Obligations_. Parent and
Purchaser shall indemnify, save and keep Target and Seller and their
respective officers, directors, shareholders partners and agents (" _Seller
Indemnified Persons_ ") harmless against and from all Damages sustained by
such Seller Indemnified Persons as a result of:

(i) any breach of any representation or warranty made by Parent and
Purchaser under this Agreement and any ancillary document; and

(ii) any breach of, or failure to comply with, any of the covenants
or obligations of Parent and Purchaser under this Agreement and any ancillary
document.

(d) _Calculating Damages_. For the sole purpose of determining the amount of
any Damages in respect of the failure of any representation or warranty to be
true and correct as of any particular date (but not for determining whether or
not any breaches of representations or warranties have occurred), subject to
Sections 9.3 and 9.4, any materiality, material adverse effect or similar
standard or qualification contained in such representation or warranty shall
be disregarded.

 

9.3 _Maximum Indemnification; Limitations_.

 

(a) The liability of each Seller to Purchaser Indemnified Persons for
indemnification for misrepresentations, breaches or defaults of
representations and warranties of Sellers and Target under Section 9.2(a) and
(b) involving representations and warranties which do not constitute
Fundamental Representations shall be capped at such Sellers Pro-
rata Interest of the sum of the Indemnification Escrow Amount plus one third
(1/3) of the Contingent Consideration that may be payable to Sellers pursuant
to Section 2 hereof, and the liability of each Seller to Purchaser Indemnified
Persons for indemnification for breach of the Fundamental Representations
shall be capped at fifty percent (50%) of such Sellers Pro-rata Interest of
the sum of the Initial Consideration paid to Sellers plus fifty percent (50%)
of the Contingent Consideration that may be payable to Sellers pursuant to
Section 2 hereof.

(b) The liability of Parent and Purchaser to Seller Indemnified Persons for
indemnification for misrepresentations, breaches or defaults of
representations and warranties of Parent and Purchaser shall be capped at an
amount equal to value of the proceeds in the Indemnification Escrow Amount
measured as of the Closing Date.

(c) Notwithstanding the foregoing, any limitation contained in the provisions
of this Section 9.3 shall not apply to finally adjudicated fraud or criminal
activity.

 



46 9.4 _Damage Threshold_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth
herein, no party shall have Liability for breaches of a representation or
warranty under Section 9.2(a)(i), 9.2(b)(i) or 9.2(c)(i) and no party may
receive any Damages or other payment for Damages under such sections unless
and until the aggregate amount of Damages owed to such indemnified party
exceeds Three Hundred Thousand Dollars (US$300,000) or its equivalent in other
currencies (the " _Indemnity Threshold_ ") and a certificate to that effect
has been delivered by the indemnified party to the indemnifying party.
Thereafter, an indemnified party shall be entitled to receive indemnities in
excess of such Indemnity Threshold. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the
Indemnity Threshold shall not apply for any breach of a Fundamental
Representation.

9.5 _Procedures for Indemnification_.

 

(a) Purchaser Indemnified Person(s) may seek indemnification from the Sellers
and Seller Indemnified Person(s) may seek indemnification from Parent (in
each case, the " _Indemnified Person_ ") for any Damages with respect to an
indemnification claim under this Agreement (a " _Claim_ ") for which Sellers
or Parent may, respectively, be liable (the " _Indemnifying Person_ ") by
promptly giving written notice (a " _Claim Notice_ ") to the Seller
Representative (as defined in Section 10.1 below) (if a claim by
Purchaser Indemnified Person(s)) or to Parent (if a claim by Seller
Indemnified Person(s)) specifying in reasonable detail the Damages claimed
(and a good faith reasonable estimate thereof), including the date each such
item was paid, or properly accrued or arose and the nature of the
misrepresentation or breach or default of representation, warranty, covenant
or agreement to which such item is related.

(b) If the Seller Representative with respect to a Claim by Purchaser
Indemnified Person(s) or if the Parent with respect to a Claim by Seller
Indemnified Person(s), in each case that is the subject of a Claim Notice
given pursuant to Section 9.5(a): (i) agrees with the Indemnified Person with
respect to such Claim, a mutually acceptable memorandum setting forth such
agreement shall be prepared and signed by both parties, or (ii) disputes the
existence or the amount of such Claim or the Indemnifying Persons obligation
hereunder to indemnify the Indemnified Person therefor, the Indemnifying
Person shall notify the Indemnified Person in writing (with
reasonable specificity) within fifteen (15) Business Days following the
Indemnifying Persons receipt of the Claim Notice (the " _Response Notice_ "),
and then the parties will negotiate in good faith to resolve such Claim for
up to twenty (20) Business Days or such other period of time as the parties
mutually agree. If the parties should then so agree with respect to resolution
of such Claim, a mutually acceptable memorandum setting forth such agreement
shall be prepared and signed by both parties. Any amounts owed to an
Indemnified Person shall be paid no later than five (5) Business Days after
resolution hereunder in the manner contemplated by Section 9.2.

 

(c) If (i) no Response Notice is received by the Indemnified Person within
fifteen (15) Business Days after the Indemnifying Persons receipt of the
Claim Notice or (ii) the parties are unable to agree on resolution of the
Claim within the twenty (20) Business Day negotiation period specified in
Section 9.5(b) after Indemnified Persons receipt of a Response Notice, then
the Claim will be deemed disputed and the matter shall be subject to
resolution under the provisions of Section 11.7.

 

(d) With respect to all references to the Indemnifying Person or Indemnified
Person in this Section, all notices to be given to or by Sellers shall be
given by or to Seller Representative.

 



47 9.6 _Third-Party Claims_. In the event that a Purchaser Indemnified Person
becomes aware of a third-party claim which could result in Damages for which
it or any other Purchaser Indemnified Person may be entitled to
indemnification hereunder, such Purchaser Indemnified Person shall promptly
and without delay notify Seller Representative of such third-party claim, and
Sellers shall be entitled, at their own expense, to participate in any defense
of such claim; _provided_ , _however_ , that no delay or failure on the part
of Parent or Purchaser in notifying Seller Representative shall relieve
Sellers from any obligation hereunder unless Sellers are thereby prejudiced
(and then solely to the extent of such prejudice). Purchaser Indemnified
Persons shall be entitled to assume the defense of such third-party claim
with counsel of its selection. Purchaser Indemnified Persons shall keep Seller
Representative informed of all material developments and events relating to
such Claim, and shall deliver to Seller Representative, within five (5)
Business Days after Purchaser Indemnified Persons receipt thereof, copies of
all notices, correspondence and documents (including court papers) received by
Purchaser relating to such Claim. Purchaser Indemnified Person shall have
the right in its sole discretion to settle any such Claim; _provided_ ,
_however_ , in the event that the Seller Representative has not consented to
any such settlement in writing prior to such settlement, Seller Representative
shall retain the right to object under this Section 9 to the amount of any
Claim by Purchaser Indemnified Person for indemnity with respect to such
settlement, including the reasonableness of the amount of such settlement;
_provided_ _further_ ,  _however_ , that in the event that Seller
Representative has consented in writing to any settlement of any third-party
claim to which any Purchaser Indemnified Person is entitled to indemnification
under this Section 9, Seller Representative shall have no power or authority
to object under any provision of this Section 9 to the amount of any Claim by
Parent or Purchaser for indemnity with respect to such settlement.

 

9.7 _Limitation on Indemnity; Exclusivity of Remedy_. Except in respect of
claims based upon fraud or violation of the federal securities laws, the
indemnification accorded by this Section 9 shall be the sole and exclusive
remedy of the parties indemnified under this Section 9; _provided_ , _however_
, that any Damages recovered by Purchaser Indemnified Persons for any Claim
made pursuant to this Section 9 shall be reduced by the amount of recovery
proceeds from any insurance policy (including title insurance) held by Target
covering such Claim and actually paid to Purchaser Indemnified Persons;
_provided_ _further_ , _however_ , that should such recovery from the
insurance policy result in an increase to such policys insurance premium,
such reduction to Damages shall be offset by the total amount of such
premium increase. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event of any breach
or failure in performance after the Closing Date of any covenant or agreement,
a non-breaching party shall also be entitled to seek specific performance,
injunction or other equitable relief. The covenants of any party shall
terminate according to the terms of such covenant and the expiration of the
applicable statute of limitations.

9.8 _Tax Treatment of Indemnification Payments_. Any indemnification payments
made pursuant to this Agreement shall be treated for Tax purposes as an
adjustment to the purchase price for the Shares.

hereby appoint and designate Mark Lotter as the initial Seller Representative.
The appointment and agency created hereby is irrevocable, and shall be deemed

notice of such vote or written consent or the date such notice of such vote or
written consent is received by Parent and Purchaser or Target. All decisions,

Representative, as being the action or decision of Sellers, and Parent and
Purchaser is hereby relieved from any liability to any Person for acts done by

Liability_. The Seller Representative shall have such powers and authority as
