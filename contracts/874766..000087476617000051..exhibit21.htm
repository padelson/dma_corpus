For purposes hereof, &#8220;willful and material breach&#8221; means a material breach by a party of &#13;&#10;the applicable provision of this Agreement as a result of an action or failure to act by such Person &#13;&#10;that it actually knew would result in a breach of this Agreement. &#13;&#10;ARTICLE X. &#13;&#10; &#13;&#10;INDEMNIFICATION &#13;&#10;Section 10.01.

Any claim for indemnification in respect of &#13;&#10;any representation or warranty that is not asserted by notice given as required herein prior to the &#13;&#10;expiration of the specified period of survival shall not be valid and any right to indemnification is &#13;&#10;hereby irrevocably waived after the expiration of such period of survival.

Should the Indemnitor so elect to assume the defense of a Third Party Claim, the &#13;&#10;Indemnitor shall not as long as it conducts such defense be liable to the Indemnitee for legal &#13;&#10;expenses incurred by the Indemnitee in connection with the defense thereof subsequent to the &#13;&#10;Indemnitor notifying the Indemnitee in writing of its election to assume such defense.

Without limiting the generality or effect of any other provision hereof, each such &#13;&#10;Indemnitee and Indemnitor will duly execute upon request all instruments reasonably necessary &#13;&#10;to evidence and perfect the above-described subrogation rights.  &#13;&#10;(b) The rights and remedies of any party in respect of any inaccuracy or breach of any &#13;&#10;representation, warranty, covenant or agreement shall in no way be limited by the fact that the &#13;&#10;act, omission, occurrence or other state of facts or circumstances upon which any claim of any &#13;&#10;such inaccuracy or breach is based may also be the subject matter of any other representation, &#13;&#10;warranty, covenant or agreement as to which there is no inaccuracy or breach.

Except as otherwise expressly provided in the &#13;&#10;Transaction Agreements, this Agreement and the other Transaction Agreements constitute the &#13;&#10;entire agreement of the parties hereto with respect to the subject matter of the Transaction &#13;&#10;Agreements and supersede all prior agreements and undertakings, both written and oral, other &#13;&#10;than the Confidentiality Agreement to the extent not in conflict with this Agreement, between or &#13;&#10;on behalf of Seller and its Affiliates, on the one hand, and Purchaser and its Affiliates, on the &#13;&#10;other hand, with respect to the subject matter of the Transaction Agreements. &#13;&#10;Section 11.05. Severability.  If any term or other provision of this Agreement is invalid, &#13;&#10;illegal or incapable of being enforced under any Applicable Law or as a matter of public policy, &#13;&#10;all other conditions and provisions of this Agreement shall nevertheless remain in full force and &#13;&#10;effect so long as the economic or legal substance of the transactions contemplated by this &#13;&#10;Agreement is not affected in any manner materially adverse to any party hereto.  Upon such &#13;&#10;determination that any term or other provision is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced, &#13;&#10;the parties hereto shall negotiate in good faith to modify this Agreement so as to effect the &#13;&#10;original intent of the parties hereto as closely as possible in a mutually acceptable manner in &#13;&#10;order that the transactions contemplated by this Agreement be consummated as originally &#13;&#10;contemplated to the greatest extent possible. If any provision of this Agreement is determined by &#13;&#10;a court of competent jurisdiction to be so broad as to be unenforceable, that provision shall be &#13;&#10;interpreted to be only so broad as it is enforceable. &#13;&#10;Section 11.06. Assignment.  This Agreement may not be assigned, in whole or in part, by &#13;&#10;operation of law or otherwise without the prior written consent of the parties hereto.  Any &#13;&#10;attempted assignment in violation of this Section 11.06 shall be void.  This Agreement shall be &#13;&#10;binding upon, shall inure to the benefit of, and shall be enforceable by the parties hereto and their &#13;&#10;successors and permitted assigns. &#13;&#10;Section 11.07. Waivers and Amendments.  No provision of this Agreement or any other &#13;&#10;Transaction Agreements may be amended, supplemented or modified except by a written &#13;&#10;instrument signed by all of the parties thereto.  No provision of this Agreement or any other &#13;&#10;Transaction Agreements may be waived except by a written instrument signed by the party &#13;&#10;against whom the waiver is to be effective.   &#13;&#10;Section 11.08. Disclosure Schedules.  Matters reflected in any Section of this Agreement, &#13;&#10;including any section or subsection of the Seller Disclosure Schedule or Purchaser Disclosure &#13;&#10;Schedule, are not necessarily limited to matters required by this Agreement to be so reflected.  &#13;&#10;Such additional matters are set forth for informational purposes and do not necessarily include &#13;&#10;other matters of a similar nature.  No reference to or disclosure of any item or other matter in any &#13;&#10;Section or Schedule of this Agreement, including any section or subsection of the Seller &#13;&#10;Disclosure Schedule or Purchaser Disclosure Schedule, shall be construed as an admission or &#13;&#10;indication that such item or other matter is material or that such item or other matter is required &#13;&#10;to be referred to or disclosed in this Agreement, the Seller Disclosure Schedule or Purchaser &#13;&#10;Disclosure Schedule.  Without limiting the foregoing, no such reference to or disclosure of a &#13;&#10;possible breach or violation of any contract, Applicable Law or Governmental Order shall be &#13;&#10;construed as an admission or indication that breach or violation exists or has actually occurred. &#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;</FONT></DIV>

Each party hereto agrees that service of &#13;&#10;any process, summons, notice or document by U.S. registered mail addressed to such party shall &#13;&#10;be effective service of process for any action, suit or proceeding brought against such party in &#13;&#10;any such court.  Purchaser hereby designates the individual listed in Section 11.03(a) to whom &#13;&#10;notice may be given on behalf of Purchaser as its true and lawful agent upon whom may be &#13;&#10;served any lawful process in any action, suit or proceeding instituted by or on behalf of Seller.  &#13;&#10;Seller hereby designates the individual listed in Section 11.03(b) to whom notice may be given &#13;&#10;on behalf of Seller as its true and lawful agent upon whom may be served any lawful process in &#13;&#10;any action, suit or proceeding instituted by or on behalf of Purchaser.  In the event either party &#13;&#10;decides to change its designation of agent, it shall provide written notice to the other party.  Each &#13;&#10;party hereto irrevocably and unconditionally waives any objection to the laying of venue of any &#13;&#10;such action, suit or proceeding brought in any such court and any claim that any such action, suit &#13;&#10;or proceeding brought in any such court has been brought in an inconvenient forum.  Each party &#13;&#10;hereto agrees that any final, nonappealable judgment in any such action, suit or proceeding &#13;&#10;brought in any such court shall be conclusive and binding upon such party and may be enforced &#13;&#10;in any other courts to whose jurisdiction such party may be subject, by suit upon such judgment. &#13;&#10;(c) EACH OF THE PARTIES HERETO HEREBY WAIVES TO THE FULLEST &#13;&#10;EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW ANY RIGHT IT MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY &#13;&#10;WITH RESPECT TO ANY LITIGATION DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY ARISING OUT OF, &#13;&#10;UNDER OR IN CONNECTION WITH THIS AGREEMENT OR THE TRANSACTIONS &#13;&#10;CONTEMPLATED BY THIS AGREEMENT.  EACH OF THE PARTIES HERETO HEREBY &#13;&#10;(A) CERTIFIES THAT NO REPRESENTATIVE, AGENT OR ATTORNEY OF THE OTHER &#13;&#10;PARTY HAS REPRESENTED, EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE, THAT SUCH OTHER &#13;&#10;PARTY WOULD NOT, IN THE EVENT OF LITIGATION, SEEK TO ENFORCE THE &#13;&#10;FOREGOING WAIVER, AND (B) ACKNOWLEDGES THAT IT HAS BEEN INDUCED TO &#13;&#10;ENTER INTO THIS AGREEMENT AND THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED BY &#13;&#10;THIS AGREEMENT, AS APPLICABLE, BY, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE MUTUAL &#13;&#10;WAIVERS AND CERTIFICATIONS IN THIS SECTION 11.09. &#13;&#10;Section 11.10.
