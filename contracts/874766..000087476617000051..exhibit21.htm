(a) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, if
any asset, property, right or contract intended to be included in the
Transferred Assets (other than with respect to the Assigned Lease, which is
addressed in Section 5.12) is not assignable, transferable or able to be
subleased or licensed (as applicable) (each a "Non-Assignable Asset") to
Purchaser without the consent or waiver of any Person (other than Seller,
Purchaser or any of their respective Affiliates or Governmental Authority),
and such consent or waiver has not been obtained on or prior to the Closing
Date, this Agreement and the other Transaction Agreements shall not
constitute an assignment, transfer, sublease or license (as applicable)
thereof unless and until such consent is obtained; provided, that this
Section 2.03(a) shall not affect whether any such asset, property, right or
contract will be deemed a "Transferred Asset" or "Assigned Contract" under
this Agreement. In each such case, Seller shall, and shall cause its
Affiliates to, use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain, prior to the
Closing, any consent or waiver from any third party (other than a
Governmental Authority) that is required for Seller or its applicable
Affiliates to sell, transfer, assign, convey and deliver the Transferred
Assets and Assigned Contracts to Purchaser or to provide the services to be
provided under the Transition Services Agreement. Purchaser shall, and shall
cause each of its Affiliates to, cooperate with Seller and its Affiliates at
Seller's request to assist Seller and its Affiliates in obtaining such
consents or waivers. Each of Seller and Purchaser shall bear its own and its
Affiliates' internal costs to obtain such consents and waivers, and the costs
payable to third parties for obtaining such consents and waivers (which, for
the avoidance of doubt, shall not include any increased fees under the terms
of any Assigned Contract from and after the Closing) shall be borne equally by
Seller and Purchaser. (b) If any such consent or waiver referred to in
Section 2.03(a) cannot be obtained prior to the Closing, then, to the extent
permitted by Applicable Law and the terms of any relevant contracts with
third parties, Seller shall, and shall cause its applicable Affiliates to,
until the earlier of (i) the time at which such consent or waiver is
obtained, and (ii) the expiration or termination of the term or duration of
any such Non-Assignable Asset (the length of such term or duration being as
it exists as of the Closing): (A) hold the Non-Assignable Assets, from and
after the Closing, in trust for the benefit of Purchaser, and all benefits
and obligations existing thereunder shall be for Purchaser's account; and (B)
take or cause to be taken such actions in its name or otherwise as Purchaser
may reasonably request so as to provide Purchaser with the benefits of such
Non-Assignable Assets, to enforce (for the benefit of Purchaser or one its
Affiliates and to the extent it is commercially reasonable to do so) any of
Seller's or Seller's Affiliates' respective rights relating to such Non-
Assignable Assets and to effect the collection of  

  

 ![](exhibit21029.jpg) 

24 money or other consideration that becomes due and payable under such Non-
Assignable Asset, and shall promptly pay over to Purchaser all money or other
consideration received by it in respect of such Non-Assignable Asset,
provided that Purchaser shall indemnify Seller and Seller's Affiliates for
any Liabilities arising out of any action or omission by Purchaser relating
to such Non-Assignable Asset (other than any such action or omission by
Purchaser at the request or direction of Seller). Purchaser shall timely pay,
perform or otherwise discharge (in accordance with the respective terms and
subject to the respective conditions thereof, and in the name of Seller or
its applicable Affiliate) all of the covenants and obligations of Seller or
its applicable Affiliate incurred after the Closing with respect to such Non-
Assignable Asset (including, for the avoidance of doubt, any increases in
fees, costs or expenses required to be paid by Seller under the terms
thereof), provided that Seller shall indemnify Purchaser for any Liabilities
arising out of any action or omission by Seller relating to such Non-
Assignable Asset (other than any such action or omission by Seller at the
request or direction of Purchaser). Purchaser and Seller shall mutually
cooperate to provide any other reasonable alternative arrangements as may be
reasonably required to implement the purpose and intent of this Agreement and
the other Transaction Agreements so that Purchaser and its Affiliates will
have access to the rights and benefits contemplated by such Non-Assignable
Asset from and after the Closing. Upon obtaining the requisite consent of any
applicable Person, any previously Non- Assignable Asset and any Leases that
were not assigned, transferred, subleased or licensed (as applicable) at the
Closing (in accordance with the first sentence of this Section 2.03(a)) shall
be promptly transferred, assigned, subleased or licensed (as applicable) by
the Seller or its applicable Affiliate(s) to Purchaser for no additional
consideration. Section 2.04. Assumption of the Assumed Liabilities. Upon the
terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement, at the
Closing, Seller shall, and shall cause its Affiliates to, assign to
Purchaser, and Purchaser shall assume, satisfy and discharge when due, any and
all Liabilities of Seller or any of its Affiliates relating to the
Transferred Assets (other than the Excluded Liabilities and excluding, for
the avoidance of doubt, (i) all Reinsured Liabilities reinsured by Purchaser
under and pursuant to the Reinsurance Agreement, which will be governed by
the terms of the Reinsurance Agreement, to the extent arising on or after the
Closing Date, (ii) any Liabilities that result from a breach by Seller or its
Affiliates of any Assigned Contract arising out of an action or omission
occurring prior to the Closing) (all such Liabilities to be so assumed,
satisfied or discharged being referred to herein as the "Assumed
Liabilities"), including the following: (a) all Liabilities arising under the
Assigned Contracts; (b) all Liabilities for Taxes relating to the Transferred
Assets other than Excluded Taxes; (c) all Liabilities assumed by Purchaser
pursuant to Articles VI and VII; and (d) all Liabilities listed on Schedule
III. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Liabilities of Seller or any of its
Affiliates relating to the Business Employee Benefit Plans and the Assigned
Lease shall not be assumed or assigned to Purchaser until the termination of
the Employee Lease Term, after which time Purchaser shall (with respect to
the Assigned Lease, subject to the terms of Section 2.08(d)) assume, satisfy
and discharge when due, any and all Liabilities of Seller or any of its
Affiliates thereunder. Section 2.05. Excluded Liabilities. Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, Purchaser will not
assume or be liable for, and Seller and its applicable Affiliates will retain
and remain responsible for, all of Seller's and such Affiliates' Liabilities  

  

 ![](exhibit21030.jpg) 

25 (fixed or contingent, known or unknown) (other than the Assumed
Liabilities and excluding, for the avoidance of doubt, all Reinsured
Liabilities reinsured by Purchaser under and pursuant to the Reinsurance
Agreement, which will be governed by the terms of the Reinsurance Agreement),
regardless of when asserted (collectively, the "Excluded Liabilities").
Without limiting the foregoing, the Excluded Liabilities include the
following: (a) all of Seller's and its Affiliates' Liabilities under the
Transaction Agreements; (b) the Excluded Benefits Liabilities; (c) any
Liability for or in respect of the payment of all Taxes of Seller or any of
its Affiliates, and of any Taxes arising out of or relating to the ownership
or use of the Transferred Assets or the conduct of the Business for a Pre-
Closing Period, other than as provided in Section 7.02 and Taxes arising out
of or relating to actions that Purchaser requests Seller to take prior to
Closing (the "Excluded Taxes"); (d) all Liabilities arising out of, in
connection with or under contracts to which Seller or any of its Affiliates
is a party other than Liabilities relating to periods (or portions thereof)
beginning from or after the Closing under the Assigned Contracts, the Assigned
Lease and any other contracts included in the Transferred Assets (which such
Liabilities shall be Assumed Liabilities); (e) Seller Retention Bonus
Liabilities; and (f) Liabilities of Seller or any of its Affiliates related
to any Permitted Liens on the Transferred Assets. Section 2.06. Place and
Date of Closing. Unless another date, time or place is agreed to in writing
by the parties hereto, the closing of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement (the "Closing") shall take place at the offices of Willkie Farr and
Gallagher LLP, 787 Seventh Avenue, New York, New York 10019, at 10:00 a.m.,
New York City time, on the third Business Day after the date on which the
last of the conditions set forth in Article VIII to be satisfied or waived
(other than those conditions that by their terms are to be satisfied at the
Closing, but subject to the satisfaction or waiver of such conditions at the
Closing) shall have been so satisfied or waived in accordance with this
Agreement (the "Condition Satisfaction"); provided, however, that if the
Condition Satisfaction occurs less than ten Business Days prior to the first
Business Day of the next calendar month, then the Closing shall take place on
the first Business Day of the calendar month immediately following the
calendar month in which the Condition Satisfaction occurs. The Closing shall
be deemed effective as of the Effective Time. For purposes of preparing the
Estimated Closing Statement, Estimated Asset Value Statement, Initial Closing
Statement, Initial Asset Value Statement, Final Closing Statement and Final
Asset Value Statement and calculating any amounts required to be calculated
therefrom, such statements shall be prepared as of the close of the last
calendar day of the month immediately preceding the month in which the

 ![](exhibit21031.jpg) 

26 Section 2.07. Consideration. (a) The consideration with respect to the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement will be an aggregate amount in
cash equal to $1,450,000,000 (the "Purchase Price"), comprised of: (i)
$1,382,000,000, constituting the ceding commission to be paid to the Ceding
Company in connection with the Reinsurance Agreement (the "Ceding
Commission"), which amount shall constitute consideration for the reinsurance
arrangements contemplated by the Reinsurance Agreement; and (ii) $68,000,000
(the "Asset Consideration") representing the aggregate purchase price for the
Transferred Assets. (b) At the Closing, Purchaser shall pay to Seller or an
Affiliate of Seller (as designated by Seller), by wire transfer of
immediately available funds to such account or accounts of Seller or its
Affiliates as Seller may designate in writing at least two Business Days
prior to the Closing Date, an amount equal to the Asset Consideration. (c)
Reference and Estimated Closing Statement; Specified Portfolio. (i) Section
2.07(c)(i) of the Seller Disclosure Schedule contains, for illustrative
purposes, a pro forma Closing Statement assuming, for this purpose, that the
Closing occurred, and the Reinsurance Agreement became effective, as of the
Reference Date (the "Reference Closing Statement"). (ii) Section 2.07(c)(ii)
of the Seller Disclosure Schedule contains a schedule of cash and Investment
Assets held by the Ceding Company or AHLIC in respect of the Business as of
the Reference Date (such portfolio, as it may have been or will be adjusted
or changed between the Reference Date and the Closing Date in accordance with
Sections 3.19 and 5.11, the "Specified Portfolio"), which portfolio had an
aggregate Accounting Value as of the Reference Date equal to the Required
Asset Value as of the Reference Date. (iii) Not less than five Business Days
prior to the anticipated Closing Date, Seller shall prepare and deliver to
Purchaser an estimated Closing Statement as of the anticipated Accounting
Date (the "Estimated Closing Statement"). The Estimated Closing Statement
shall be prepared in accordance with the Transaction Accounting Principles
applied in a manner consistent with the preparation of the Reference Closing
Statement and be in the same format as the Reference Closing Statement. (d)
Determination of Transferred Portfolio.  

  

 ![](exhibit21032.jpg) 

27 (i) Not less than two Business Days prior to the anticipated Closing Date,
Seller shall prepare and deliver to Purchaser a calculation of the Closing
Required Asset Value, which calculation will be based on the Required Asset
Value reflected in the Estimated Closing Statement and will take into account
all Capital Gain or Loss Adjustments and all Reallocated Asset Value
Adjustments required pursuant to Section 5.11 or Section 3.19(b) through the
Closing Date (the "Estimated Closing Required Asset Value"). (ii) The
"Transferred Portfolio" will be determined as follows: (A) if the Accounting
Value of the Specified Portfolio as of the Closing Date equals the Closing
Required Asset Value, the Transferred Portfolio will comprise all, and only,
the cash and Investment Assets in the Specified Portfolio as of immediately
prior to the Closing; (B) if the Accounting Value of the Specified Portfolio
as of the Closing Date is less than the Closing Required Asset Value, the
Transferred Portfolio will comprise (x) all of the cash and Investment Assets
in the Specified Portfolio as of immediately prior to the Closing and (y)
cash or other Investment Assets selected by Seller in accordance with the
Pre-Closing Investment Guidelines that have an aggregate Fair Market Value
equal to the amount of such shortfall; and (C) if the Accounting Value of
the Specified Portfolio as of the Closing Date is greater than the Closing
Required Asset Value, Seller will select for removal from the Specified
Portfolio cash or Investment Assets that have an aggregate Accounting Value
equal to such excess in accordance with the Selection Waterfall. The cash
and Investment Assets remaining in the Specified Portfolio after such removal
will be the Transferred Portfolio. (iii) Concurrently with the delivery by
Seller to Purchaser of the calculation of the Estimated Closing Required
Asset Value pursuant to clause (i) of this Section 2.07(d), Seller will also
deliver to Purchaser (A) a schedule showing the cash and Investment Assets in
the Transferred Portfolio and its estimated calculation of the aggregate
Accounting Value of the cash and Investment Assets in the Transferred
Portfolio as of immediately prior to the Closing (the "Estimated Asset Value
Statement"), and (B) a calculation of Seller's estimate of the Required
Balance (as defined in the Reinsurance Agreement) as of the Closing Date
based on amounts set forth on the Estimated Closing Statement and calculated
using the aggregate FMV-Ex Accrued and the aggregate Book Value of the
Transferred Portfolio (the "Estimated Required Balance").  

  

 ![](exhibit21033.jpg) 

28 (e) Payment of Ceding Commissions and Initial Transfer Amounts. At the
Closing, upon the terms set forth in this Agreement and the Reinsurance
Agreement: (i) in addition to the payment Purchaser is required to make to
Seller pursuant to Section 2.07(b) above, Purchaser shall pay to Seller, by
wire transfer of immediately available funds to an account or accounts
designated in writing to Purchaser by Seller at least two Business Days prior
to the Closing Date, an amount equal to the Ceding Commission; and (ii)
Seller shall cause the Ceding Company (or AHLIC on behalf of the Ceding
Company) to deposit into the Trust Account, on behalf of Purchaser, the cash
and Investment Assets in the Transferred Portfolio; provided that: (A) if on
the Closing Date the aggregate Fair Market Value of the cash and Investment
Assets in the Transferred Portfolio exceeds the Estimated Required Balance,
then Seller shall cause the Ceding Company (or AHLIC on behalf of the Ceding
Company) to transfer to Purchaser cash or Investment Assets from the
Transferred Portfolio selected by Purchaser with a Fair Market Value equal to
such excess and shall cause the Ceding Company (or AHLIC on behalf of the
Ceding Company) to transfer the remainder of the cash and Investment Assets
in the Transferred Portfolio to the Trust Account; and (B) if on the Closing
Date the aggregate Fair Market Value of the cash and Investment Assets in the
Transferred Portfolio is less than the Estimated Required Balance, Purchaser
shall, at the Closing, transfer to the Trust Account Authorized Investments
(as defined in the Trust Agreement) having a Fair Market Value as of the
Closing Date equal to such shortfall. Section 2.08. Closing Deliveries. (a)

2.08(b), as applicable, such counterparts shall not be effective at the
Closing but shall instead be held in escrow and not become effective with
respect to such agreement unless and until, and shall become effective with
respect to such agreement only if (i) the applicable Lease Consent is
obtained on or prior to December 31, 2017 and (ii) the Employee Lease Term has

determination of the Accounting Value of the Transferred Portfolio as of the
Accounting Date (the "Initial Asset Value Statement"); and (iii) Seller's
calculation of the Closing Required Asset Value based on the amounts set
forth on the Initial Closing Statement and the Initial Asset Value Statement
and taking into account all Capital Gain or Loss Adjustments and all
Reallocated Asset Value Adjustments required from the Reference Date through
the Closing Date (the  

  

 ![](exhibit21037.jpg) 

32 "Initial Closing Required Asset Value Statement"). Each of the Initial
Closing Statement, Initial Asset Value Statement and the Initial Closing
Required Asset Value Statement will be accompanied by reasonably detailed
supporting documentation relating to the amounts and calculations therein.
Each of the amounts set forth on the Estimated Closing Statement, the Initial
Closing Statement and the Final Closing Statement shall not include any
interest maintenance reserve related to the transfer of Investment Assets
from AHLIC to the Ceding Company in connection with the Pre-Closing
Commutation; provided, that the foregoing shall not affect the inclusion of
such amounts in the calculation of the "Closing Date IMR Amount" under the
Reinsurance Agreement. (b) During the 60 days immediately following
Purchaser's receipt of the Initial Closing Statement, the Initial Asset Value
Statement and the Initial Closing Required Asset Value Statement (the "Review

Sellers's working papers and any working papers of Seller's independent
accountants directly relating to the preparation of the Initial Closing
Statement, the Initial Asset Value Statement and the Initial Closing Required
Asset Value Statement, as well as all of the Books and Records and other
relevant information or documents relating to the operations and finances of
the Business with respect to the period up to and including the Closing Date,
and Seller shall make available the individuals in its or its Affiliates'
employ who are responsible for and knowledgeable about the information used
in, and the preparation or calculation (as applicable) of, the Initial
Closing Statement, the Initial Asset Value Statement and the Initial Closing
Required Asset Value Statement in order to respond to the inquiries of
Purchaser; provided, however, that the independent accountants of Seller
shall not be obligated to make any working papers available to Purchaser
unless and until Purchaser has signed a customary confidentiality and hold
harmless agreement relating to such access to working papers in form and
substance reasonably acceptable to such independent accountants. (c) If
Purchaser disagrees with the Initial Closing Statement, the Initial Asset
Value Statement or the Initial Closing Required Asset Value Statement
(including any amount or computation set forth therein) in any respect and on
any basis (including that the representations and warranties in Section
3.18(d) or the covenants in Section 5.11 were breached), Purchaser may, on or
prior to the last day of the Review Period, deliver a notice to Seller setting
forth, in reasonable detail, each disputed item or amount and the basis for
Purchaser's disagreement therewith (the "Notice of Disagreement"). The Notice
of Disagreement shall set forth, with respect to each disputed item,
Purchaser's position as to the correct amount or computation that should have
been included in the Initial Closing Statement, the Initial Asset Value
Statement or the Initial Closing Required Asset Value Statement. If Purchaser
does not deliver a Notice of Disagreement with respect to the Initial Closing
Statement, the Initial Asset Value Statement or the Initial Closing Required
Asset Value Statement to Seller by the end of the Review Period, the Initial
Closing Statement, the Initial Asset Value Statement or the Initial Closing
Required Asset Value Statement, as applicable, shall become final and binding
on the parties. (d) During the 20 Business Days immediately following the
delivery of a Notice of Disagreement, Seller and Purchaser shall seek in good
faith to resolve any disagreement that they may have with respect to the
matters specified in the Notice of Disagreement.  

  

 ![](exhibit21038.jpg) 

33 (e) If, at the end of such 20 Business Day period, Seller and Purchaser
have been unable to resolve all disagreements that they may have with respect
to the matters specified in the Notice of Disagreement, then Seller and
Purchaser shall submit all matters that remain in dispute with respect to the
Notice of Disagreement (along with a copy of the applicable Initial Closing
Statement, the Initial Asset Value Statement and the Initial Closing Required
Asset Value Statement marked to indicate those line items that are in
dispute) to PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP or, if PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP is
unwilling or unable to serve, another independent certified public accounting
firm in the United States of international recognition mutually agreeable to
Seller and Purchaser and that is not the auditor or independent accounting
firm of any of the parties (the "Independent Accountant"), to make a
determination with respect to all matters in dispute. (f) Seller and
Purchaser shall use commercially reasonable efforts to cause the Independent
Accountant to render a determination within 30 days after the submission of
such matters to the Independent Accountant or as soon as practicable
thereafter. Seller, on the one hand, and Purchaser, on the other hand, shall
promptly (and in any event within five Business Days) after the Independent
Accountant's engagement, each submit to the Independent Accountant their
respective computations of the disputed items identified in the Notice of
Disagreement and information, arguments and support for their respective
positions, and shall concurrently deliver a copy of such materials to the
other party. Each party shall then be given an opportunity to supplement the
information, arguments and support included in its initial submission with
one additional submission to respond to any arguments or positions taken by
the other party in such other party's initial submission, which supplemental
information shall be submitted to the Independent Accountant (with a copy
thereof to the other party) within 10 Business Days after the first date on
which both parties have submitted their respective initial submissions to the
Independent Accountant. The Independent Accountant shall thereafter be
permitted to request additional or clarifying information from the parties,
and each of the parties shall cooperate and shall cause their Representatives
to cooperate with such requests of the Independent Accountant. The
Independent Accountant shall determine, based solely on the materials so
presented by the parties and upon information received in response to such
requests for additional or clarifying information and not by independent
review, only those issues in dispute specifically set forth in the Notice of
Disagreement and shall render a written report to Seller and Purchaser in
which the Independent Accountant shall, after considering all matters set
forth in the Notice of Disagreement, determine what adjustments, if any,
should be made to the amounts and computations set forth in the Initial
Closing Statement, Initial Asset Value Statement and the Initial Closing
Required Asset Value Statement solely as to the disputed items. Such written
report shall set forth, in reasonable detail, the determination of the
Independent Accountant with respect to each of the disputed line items
specified in the Notice of Disagreement and the revisions, if any, to be made
to the Initial Closing Statement, the Initial Asset Value Statement or the
Initial Closing Required Asset Value Statement resulting therefrom, together
with supporting calculations. With respect to each disputed line item, such
determination shall be made in accordance with the Transaction Accounting
Principles and the terms of this Agreement and, if not in accordance with the
position of either Seller or Purchaser, shall not be in excess of the highest
amount proposed by either party, nor less than the lowest amount proposed by
either party, in the Notice of Disagreement, the Initial Closing Statement,
the Initial Asset Value Statement or the Initial Closing Required Asset Value
Statement with  

  

 ![](exhibit21039.jpg) 

34 respect to such disputed line item. For the avoidance of doubt, the
Independent Accountant shall not review any line items or make any
determination with respect to any matter other than those matters in the
Notice of Disagreement that remain in dispute. The Independent Accountant's
final written determination shall, absent fraud or manifest error, be
conclusive and binding upon Seller and Purchaser, shall not be subject to
review by a court or other tribunal and shall have the same force and effect
as an arbitration award governed by the Federal Arbitration Act, 9 U.S.C. §1
et. seq. The "Final Closing Statement" means the Initial Closing Statement as
made final and binding either pursuant to Section 2.09(c) or after it has
been modified to reflect any revisions thereto made through the mutual
agreement of Purchaser and Seller or through the determination of the
Independent Accountant pursuant to this Section 2.09(f). The "Final Asset
Value Statement" means the Initial Asset Value Statement as made final and
binding either pursuant to Section 2.09(c) or after it has been modified to
reflect any revisions thereto made through the mutual agreement of Purchaser
and Seller or through the determination of the Independent Accountant
pursuant to this Section 2.09(f). The "Final Closing Required Asset Value
Statement" means the Initial Closing Required Asset Value Statement as made
final and binding either pursuant to Section 2.09(c) or after it has been
modified to reflect any revisions thereto made through mutual agreement of
Purchaser and Seller or through the determination of the Independent
Accountant pursuant to this Section 2.09(f), and the "Final Closing Required
Asset Value" is the Closing Required Asset Value as set forth on the Final
Closing Required Asset Value Statement. (g) The cost of the Independent
Accountant's review and determination shall be shared equally by Seller and
Purchaser. During the review by the Independent Accountant, Seller and
Purchaser shall each make available to the Independent Accountant such
individuals and such information, books, records and work papers, as may be
reasonably required by the Independent Accountant to fulfill its obligations
under Sections 2.09(e) and 2.09(f); provided, however, that the independent
accountants of Seller or Purchaser shall not be obligated to make any working
papers available to the Independent Accountant unless and until the
Independent Accountant has signed a customary confidentiality and hold
harmless agreement relating to such access to working papers in form and
substance reasonably acceptable to such independent accountants. In acting
under this Agreement, the Independent Accountant shall be entitled to the
privileges and immunities of an arbitrator. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary contained in this Agreement, the provisions of this Section 2.09
represent the sole and exclusive method for determining the Final Closing
Statement, the Final Asset Value Statement, the Final Closing Required Asset
Value Statement and the Final Closing Required Asset Value. (h) Seller shall,
following the Closing through the date that the Final Closing Statement, the
Final Asset Value Statement and the Final Closing Required Asset Value
Statement become final and binding on the parties in accordance with the last
three sentences of Section 2.09(f), take all actions necessary to maintain
and preserve all accounting books, records, policies and procedures on which
the Initial Closing Statement, Initial Asset Value Statement and Initial
Closing Required Asset Value Statement are based or on which the Final Closing
Statement, Final Asset Value Statement or Final Closing Required Asset Value
Statement are to be based so as not to impede or delay the final
determination of the amounts set forth therein.  

  

 ![](exhibit21040.jpg) 

35 Section 2.10. Post-Closing Adjustments. (a) The following adjustments
will be made based on the amounts set forth on the Final Closing Statement,
Final Asset Value Statement and Final Closing Required Asset Value Statement:
(i) Purchaser shall pay to the Ceding Company the True-Up Amount, if
positive; or (ii) Seller shall cause the Ceding Company to pay into the Trust
Account the absolute value of the True-Up Amount, if negative. (b) Payment
of any amounts due under Section 2.10(a) shall be made within five Business
Days after the date on which all three of the Final Closing Statement, the
Final Asset Value Statement and Final Closing Required Asset Value Statement
have become such in accordance with the last three sentences of Section
2.09(f) by wire transfer of immediately available funds. ARTICLE III.

individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to

creations that, individually or in the aggregate, would not reasonably be
expected to have a Material Adverse Effect. Section 3.05. Consents and
Approvals. Except in connection, or in compliance, with the approvals,

of Seller (as applicable) of the transactions contemplated by the Transaction
Agreements to which it is or is contemplated to become a party will not,
require any consent, approval, license, permit, order, qualification or

date hereof: (i) the Assigned Contracts; (ii) any contract that (A) contains

from all other Governmental Authorities that are necessary for the current
operation and conduct of the Business and to own or use its assets and
properties to the extent relating to the Business (collectively, the
"Operating Permits"), except where the failure to hold an Operating Permit
would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a

Representatives reasonable access, upon reasonable advance notice and during
normal business hours, to such contracts, documents and information of or
relating to the assets, liabilities, business, operations and other aspects
of the Business as Purchaser may reasonably request; provided, however, that
Seller shall not be obligated to provide such access or information if Seller
determines, in its reasonable judgment, that doing so would violate
Applicable Law or a contract, agreement or obligation of confidentiality owing
to a third party, jeopardize the protection of an attorney-client privilege,
or expose Seller or any of its Affiliates to risk of liability for disclosure
of sensitive or personal information; provided, further, that Seller shall
not be obligated to provide such access to its offices if Seller determines,
in its reasonable judgment, that such contracts, documents and information
can be provided electronically or in another reasonably accessible location.
Purchaser agrees that it will hold, and will cause its Representatives to
hold, any information so obtained in confidence to the extent required by,
and in accordance with, the provisions of the Confidentiality Agreement and
Section 5.04. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth herein, none
of Seller, its Affiliates or their respective Representatives shall be
required to disclose or provide access to Excluded Books and Records to
Purchaser or, prior to the Closing Date, any of its Representatives or any
information that Seller reasonably determines to be competitively sensitive.

Affiliates' Representatives for any  

  

 ![](exhibit21062.jpg) 

57 reasonable business purpose relating to the Business, including in
connection with Seller's pre- Closing employment of the Transferred Employees
or Purchaser's preparation or examination of regulatory and statutory filings
and financial statements and the conduct of any litigation relating to the
Business (other than any litigation or dispute between Seller or its
Affiliates, on the one hand, and Purchaser or its Affiliates, on the other
hand), or the conduct of any regulatory authority, policyholder, reinsurer or
other dispute resolution or any other Third Party Claim (whether or not such
Third Party Claim is the subject of an indemnification claim by a Purchaser
Indemnified Person or Seller Indemnified Person), whether pending or
threatened; provided, however, that Seller shall not be obligated to provide
such access to its offices if Seller determines, in its reasonable judgment,
that such Excluded Books and Records can be provided electronically or in
another reasonably accessible location. Access to such Representatives and
Excluded Books and Records shall be at Purchaser's expense and shall not
unreasonably interfere with Seller's or its Affiliates' or any of their
respective successor companies' business operations. (b) For a period of
five years following the Closing Date, Purchaser shall: (i) allow Seller,
upon reasonable prior notice and during normal business hours, through its
Representatives, the right, at Seller's expense, to examine and make copies,

Purchaser or its Affiliates at or after the Closing and of which neither
Seller nor any of its Affiliates retained a copy; and (ii) allow Seller to
interview Purchaser's Representatives, upon reasonable prior notice and during
normal business hours, for any reasonable business purpose relating to the
Business, including in connection with Seller's preparation or examination of
regulatory and statutory filings and financial statements, and the conduct of
any litigation relating to the Business (other than any litigation or dispute
between Seller or its Affiliates, on the one hand, and Purchaser or its
Affiliates, on the other hand), or the conduct of any regulatory, contract
holder, reinsurer or other dispute resolution or any other Third Party Claim
(whether or not such Third Party Claim is the subject of an indemnification
claim by a Purchaser Indemnified Person or Seller Indemnified Person),
whether pending or threatened; provided, however, that Purchaser shall not be
obligated to provide such access to its offices if Purchaser determines, in
its reasonable judgment, that such Books and Records can be provided
electronically or in another reasonably accessible location. Access to such
Representatives and Books and Records shall be at Seller's expense and shall
not unreasonably interfere with the business operations of Purchaser or its
Affiliates. (c) Except as otherwise prohibited by Applicable Law and subject
to clause (d) and (e) below, Purchaser shall, with respect to the Books and
Records, and Seller and its Affiliates shall, with respect to the Excluded

this Section 5.03(a) and (b) and Section 5.05: (i) comply in all material
respects with all Applicable Laws relating to the preservation and retention
of records; (ii) apply preservation and retention policies that are no less
stringent than those generally applied by such party; and (iii) without
limitation to the foregoing, for at least five years after the Closing Date,

58 (d) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, a party hereto
shall not be obligated to provide such access to any Books and Records,
Retained Books and Records, or Excluded Books and Records or information if
such party determines, in its reasonable judgment, that doing so would
violate Applicable Law (except that copies thereof shall be furnished to the
requesting party or its Representatives to the extent permitted under
Applicable Law) or a contract, agreement or obligation of confidentiality
owing to a third party, or jeopardize the protection of an attorney-client
privilege; provided, that the party contemplated to provide access shall use
commercially reasonable efforts to obtain waivers or make other arrangements
(including redacting information or entering into joint defense agreements)
that would enable otherwise required disclosure to the other party or its
Representatives to occur without so jeopardizing privilege or contravening
such Applicable Law, contract or obligation of confidentiality. (e)
Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement to the contrary,
Purchaser shall, and shall cause its Affiliates to, retain and preserve all
Books and Records (in whatever form maintained) transferred to Purchaser that
are subject to a Legal Hold in effect as of the Closing, until such time as
Seller notifies Purchaser in writing that such Books and Records may be
destroyed. Seller shall use commercially reasonable efforts to notify
Purchaser within 30 days of the termination of any applicable Legal Hold.
Purchaser shall provide Seller and its Affiliates with access to any Books
and Records subject to this Section 5.03(e); provided that access to Books
and Records subject to Legal Holds shall be limited in time only by the terms
of the applicable Legal Hold; provided, however, that Purchaser shall not be
obligated to provide access to its offices for such purposes if Purchaser
determines, in its reasonable judgment, that such Books and Records can be
provided electronically or in another reasonably accessible location.
Section 5.04. Confidentiality. (a) The terms of the confidentiality
agreement, dated June 12, 2017 (the "Confidentiality Agreement"), between
Seller and The Hartford Financial Services Group Inc. shall continue in full
force and effect until the Closing, at which time the confidentiality
obligations under the Confidentiality Agreement shall terminate. (b)
Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing in the Confidentiality Agreement shall
restrict, prohibit or delay the ability of Seller or Purchaser to exercise its
rights or perform its obligations under the Transaction Agreements. If, for
any reason, the transactions contemplated by this Agreement are not
consummated, the Confidentiality Agreement shall nonetheless continue in full
force and effect in accordance with its terms. (c) From and after the
Closing: (i) Seller shall, and shall cause its Representatives to, maintain
in confidence any written, oral or other information to the extent relating to
the Business obtained by virtue of Seller's ownership of the Business prior
to the Closing, including the Retained Books and Records; and (ii) Purchaser
shall, and shall cause its Representatives to, maintain in confidence any
written, oral or other information of or relating to Seller or its Affiliates
(other than information relating to the Business) obtained by virtue of its
ownership of the Business from and after the Closing, except, in each case,
to the extent that the applicable party is required to disclose such
information by judicial or administrative process or pursuant to  

  

 ![](exhibit21064.jpg) 

59 Applicable Law (provided that, except in connection with any required
disclosure pursuant to any Applicable Law relating to Taxes and any filings
required by the applicable securities laws, such party has given the other
party written notice of such potential disclosure and, to the extent
reasonably requested by such other party, cooperated with such other party in
seeking an appropriate order or other remedy protecting such information from
disclosure) or such information can be shown to have been in the public
domain through no fault of the applicable party. (d) Effective as of the
Closing, Seller shall (i) enforce, on behalf of and at the request of
Purchaser, Seller's rights, powers and privileges under any in-force
confidentiality agreements with third Persons other than Purchaser regarding
the potential sale of the Business executed prior to the date hereof (each, a
"Seller Confidentiality Agreement") in connection with any material breach
thereof by such third persons, provided that Purchaser shall reimburse Seller
for its costs and expenses (including reasonable legal fees and expenses)
incurred in connection with such enforcement, and (ii) submit written
requests to all third Persons who executed a Seller Confidentiality Agreement
that such other Persons promptly deliver to Purchaser or otherwise destroy
all proprietary or confidential material furnished to such Person by or on
behalf of Seller or its Affiliates in accordance with the terms of such
Seller Confidentiality Agreement. Section 5.05. Maintenance and Transfer of
Books and Records. (a) Through the Closing Date, Seller shall, and shall
cause its Affiliates to, maintain the Books and Records in all material
respects in the same manner and with the same care that the Books and Records
have been maintained for the 12-month period prior to the execution of this
Agreement. Books and Records of the type identified in Section 5.05(a) of the
Seller Disclosure Schedule, including, for the avoidance of doubt, Books and
Records that (i) are necessary for Seller to provide services under the
Transition Services Agreement (to the extent that such Books and Records
cannot reasonably be duplicated and a copy retained by Seller or its
applicable Affiliate(s)); or (ii) are not permitted to be disclosed or
transferred under applicable Law (such Books and Records, the "Retained Books
and Records"), shall not be transferred at the Closing but will instead be
made available by Seller to Purchaser, at Seller's expense, from and after
the Closing in accordance with the guidelines set forth in Section 5.05(a) of
the Seller Disclosure Schedule. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in
this Agreement, Seller and its Affiliates shall not be required to transfer
the Retained Books and Records at the Closing or on the Closing Date, and
Seller and its Affiliates shall be entitled to retain copies of any Books and
Records transferred to Purchaser at the Closing or on the Closing Date. Seller
shall, and shall cause its Affiliates to, provide Purchaser and its
Representatives reasonable access to such Retained Books and Records, and
once any Retained Books and Records are no longer necessary for the provision
of services under the Transition Services Agreement or are permitted to be
transferred, as applicable, Seller shall cause such Retained Books and Records
to be delivered to Purchaser (or a Person designated by Purchaser) or, at
Purchaser's option, to be destroyed. (b) At the Closing, Seller shall cause
all Books and Records (except the Retained Books and Records) in the
possession or control of Seller or any of its Affiliates to be delivered to
Purchaser (or a Person designated by Purchaser) in accordance with the
requirements and guidelines set forth in Section 5.05(b) of the Seller
Disclosure Schedule.

60 Section 5.06. Consents, Approvals and Filings. (a) Subject to the terms
and conditions hereof, Seller and Purchaser shall each use their reasonable
best efforts, and shall cooperate fully with each other, (i) to comply as
promptly as practicable with all requirements of Governmental Authorities
applicable to the transactions contemplated by the Transaction Agreements and
(ii) to obtain as promptly as practicable all Governmental Approvals
necessary in connection with the consummation of the transactions
contemplated by the Transaction Agreements; provided that, Purchaser shall be
responsible for the costs (including any license or other fees and expenses)
associated with Seller, Purchaser or any of their respective Affiliates
obtaining any such Governmental Approvals. In connection therewith, Seller
and Purchaser shall make and cause their respective Affiliates to make all
legally required filings as promptly as practicable in order to facilitate
prompt consummation of the transactions contemplated by the Transaction
Agreements, shall provide and shall cause their respective Affiliates to
provide such information and communications to Governmental Authorities as
such Governmental Authorities may request, shall take and shall cause their
respective Affiliates to take all steps that are necessary, proper, or
advisable to avoid any Action by any Governmental Authority with respect to
the transactions contemplated by the Transaction Agreements, shall defend or
contest in good faith any Action by any third party (including any
Governmental Authority), whether judicial or administrative, challenging any
of the Transaction Agreements or the transactions contemplated thereby, or
that could otherwise prevent, impede, interfere with, hinder, or delay in any
material respect the consummation of the transactions contemplated thereby,
including by using their reasonable best efforts to have vacated or reversed
any stay or temporary restraining order entered with respect to the
transactions contemplated by any of the Transaction Agreements by any
Governmental Authority, and shall consent to and comply with any condition
imposed by any Governmental Authority on its grant of any such permit, order,
consent, approval, or authorization, other than any Burdensome Condition.
Each of the parties shall provide to the other party copies of all
applications or other communications to Governmental Authorities in
connection with this Agreement in advance of the filing or submission
thereof. (b) Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, as promptly as
practicable after the date hereof, each of Purchaser and Seller shall file
with all applicable Insurance Regulators all required requests for approval
of the transactions contemplated by the Transaction Agreements, which
requests shall include all required exhibits. A reasonable time prior to
furnishing any written materials to any Insurance Regulator in connection with
the transactions contemplated by the Transaction Agreements, the furnishing
party shall provide the other party with a copy thereof, and the other party
shall have a reasonable opportunity to provide comments thereon, which
comments shall be considered by the furnishing party in good faith. Each party
shall give to the other party prompt written notice if it receives any notice
or other communication from any Insurance Regulator or other Governmental
Authority in connection with the transactions contemplated by the Transaction
Agreements and, in the case of any such notice or communication that is in
writing, shall promptly furnish the other party with a copy thereof. If any
Governmental Authority requires that a hearing be held in connection with any
such approval, each party shall use its reasonable best efforts to arrange for
such hearing to be held promptly after the notice that such hearing is
required has been received by such party. Each party shall give to the other
party reasonable prior written notice of the time and place

61 when any meetings, telephone calls, or other conferences may be held by it
with any Governmental Authority in connection with the transactions
contemplated by the Transaction Agreements, and the other party shall have
the right to have a representative or representatives attend or otherwise
participate in any such meeting, telephone call, or other conference unless
prohibited by Applicable Law. (c) Notwithstanding anything herein to the
contrary, neither Purchaser nor Seller shall be obligated to take or refrain
from taking or to agree to it, its Affiliates or any of their respective
Representatives taking or refraining from taking any action or to permit or
suffer to exist any restriction, condition, limitation or requirement which,
individually or together with all other such actions, restrictions,
conditions, limitations or requirements, would constitute a Burdensome
Condition. As used in this Agreement, "Burdensome Condition" means any
arrangement, condition or restriction (i) in the case of Purchaser, (A) to
sell or hold separate or agree to sell, divest or discontinue, before or
after the Closing Date, any properties, assets, businesses or licenses of
Purchaser or its Affiliates that are material to Purchaser and its
Affiliates, taken as a whole, or to the Business, as applicable, or (B) that
otherwise is reasonably likely to have a Material Adverse Effect or a
material adverse effect on the business, financial condition, operations or
results of operations of Purchaser and its Affiliates, taken as a whole; and
(ii) in the case of Seller, would require Seller or any of its Affiliates to
provide any guarantee or incur any liability with respect to the Business or
the Transferred Assets after the Closing Date, or restrict the ability of
Seller or any of its Affiliates to conduct their respective businesses after
the Closing Date. Section 5.07. Further Assurances. (a) Subject to the terms
and conditions herein provided, including Section 5.06, each of the parties
hereto shall, and shall cause its Affiliates to, execute such documents and
other papers and perform such further acts as may be reasonably required to
carry out the provisions hereof and the transactions contemplated hereby and
by the other Transaction Agreements. Each such party shall, at or prior to
the Closing Date, use its reasonable best efforts to fulfill or obtain the
fulfillment of the conditions precedent to the consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby and by the other Transaction Agreements,
including the execution and delivery of any documents, certificates,
instruments or other papers and the taking of any other actions that are
reasonably necessary for the consummation of the transactions contemplated
hereby and by the other Transaction Agreements. (b) Subject to the terms and
conditions of this Agreement, on and after the Closing Date, Seller and
Purchaser shall, and shall cause their respective Affiliates to, take all
reasonable actions and execute any additional documents, instruments or
conveyances of any kind which may be reasonably necessary to put Purchaser
and its Affiliates in full possession and operating control of the Business
and to effect fully the separation of the Business from Seller and its
Affiliates. Section 5.08. Privacy and Data Security Compliance; Use of
Information. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement or any
Transaction Agreement to the contrary, none of Seller, Purchaser or any of
their respective Affiliates shall be required to take any action that would
violate or conflict with, and each such Person shall comply with, all  

  

 ![](exhibit21067.jpg) 

62 Privacy and Data Security Laws. Notwithstanding any other provision of
this Agreement, Seller and Purchaser shall use their respective reasonable
best efforts to ensure that all Personal Data about individual insureds and
employees on leaves of absence under Group Contracts or other individuals is
used, shared, accessed, stored, transmitted, disclosed, or otherwise processed
in a manner (including the scope of information) that complies with, and
facilitates each party's compliance with, Privacy and Data Security Laws. For
the avoidance of doubt, any Personal Data relating to individual insureds and
employees on leaves of absence under Group Contracts accessed by or disclosed
to Purchaser or any of its Affiliates pursuant to this Agreement shall be
subject to Purchaser's confidentiality obligations under Section 5.04 and
under the Administrative Services Agreement. Section 5.09. Non-Solicitation

Affiliates shall, whether directly or indirectly, solicit for employment or
employ any Transferred Employee or any employee of the Purchaser whose name
is set forth on Section 5.09(a) of the Purchaser Disclosure Schedule;
provided, that nothing in this Section 5.09(a) shall prohibit Seller or any
of its Affiliates from engaging in general solicitations not directed at such
Persons (including general media advertisements and the use of a search firm
not directed to target Transferred Employees) or from soliciting or employing
any such Person whose employment with or engagement by Purchaser or any of its
Affiliates has been terminated by Purchaser or its applicable Affiliate at
least three months prior to the first such solicitation or employment. (b)

Disclosure Schedule; provided, that nothing in this Section 5.09(b) shall

solicitations not directed at such Persons (including general media
advertisements and the use of a search firm not directed to target such
Persons) or from soliciting or employing any such Person whose employment with
or engagement by Seller or any of its Affiliates has been terminated by Seller
or its applicable Affiliate at least three months prior to the first such
solicitation or employment. (c) For a period of 24 months following the
Closing Date (including during the Employee Lease Term), without the prior
written consent of Purchaser, neither Seller nor any of its Affiliates shall,
whether directly or indirectly, interfere with Purchaser's obligations under
Section 6.01(a) or attempt to retain for employment or rehire any Employee set
forth on Section 6.01(a)(i) of the Seller Disclosure Schedule who does not
become a Transferred Employee; provided, that nothing in this Section 5.09(c)
shall prohibit Seller or any of its Affiliates from engaging in general
solicitations not directed at such Persons (including general media
advertisements and the use of a search firm not directed to target such
Persons). Section 5.10. Use of Names. (a) At the Closing, Seller shall enter
into a royalty-free license agreement with Purchaser substantially in the
form attached hereto as Exhibit I (the "Trademark License  

  

 ![](exhibit21068.jpg) 

63 Agreement"), among other things, permitting Purchaser to use the "Aetna"
name and related Trademarks on a transitional basis in connection with the
operation of the Business in the United States in accordance with the terms
thereof. (b) Except as otherwise contemplated by the Administrative Services
Agreement, the Distribution Agreement, the Transition Services Agreement and
the Trademark License Agreement in accordance with the terms thereof: (i)
following the Closing Date (including in connection with the operation of the
Business and the Transferred Assets), Purchaser shall not, and shall cause
its Affiliates not to, use any of the names or Trademarks set forth in Section
5.10 of the Seller Disclosure Schedule, any other Trademarks of Seller's
Affiliates that include the name "Aetna," or any name, Trademark, or acronym
that is confusingly similar to, or is based on or incorporates, any of such
names or Trademarks (collectively, the "Seller Trademarks") whether or not in
combination with other words, symbols, or other distinctive or non-distinctive
elements, and all trade, corporate or business names, trademarks, tag-lines,
identifying logos, trade dress, monograms, slogans, service marks, domain
names, brand names, and other name or source identifiers that are
derivations, translations, adaptations, combinations or variations of the
Seller Trademarks or Trademarks of Seller's Affiliates, or embodying any of
the foregoing, whether or not in combination with other words, symbols, or
other distinctive or non-distinctive elements; and (ii) Purchaser, for itself
and its Affiliates, agrees that any and all rights arising out of the
Transferred Assets to the Seller Trademarks or Trademarks of Seller's
Affiliates, whether written or oral, with Seller or its Affiliates, shall
terminate on the Closing Date without recourse by Purchaser or any of its
Affiliates. Neither Purchaser nor any of its Affiliates shall seek to
register in any jurisdiction any trade, corporate, or business name,
trademark, tag-line, identifying logo, trade dress, monogram, slogan, service
mark, domain name, brand name, or other name or source identifier that is a
derivation, translation, adaptation, combination, or variation of the Seller
Trademarks or Trademarks of Seller's Affiliates. Section 5.11. Pre-Closing
Management of Specified Portfolio. (a) Monthly Asset Value Statements and
Related Adjustments. (i) After the end of each calendar month that occurs
between the date hereof and the Closing Date, Seller shall estimate in good
faith the Adjusted Required Asset Value and the Accounting Value of the
Specified Portfolio as of the end of such month and deliver to Purchaser a
statement (each, a "Monthly Asset Value Statement") specifying such Adjusted
Required Asset Value and Accounting Value as of the end of such month,
provided that no such Monthly Asset Value Statement shall be so prepared or
delivered with respect to the month preceding the month in which the Closing
occurs. (ii) If the Accounting Value of the Specified Portfolio set forth in
a Monthly Asset Value Statement is less than the Adjusted Required Asset
Value set forth in such Monthly Asset Value Statement, Seller shall (or shall
cause the Ceding Company or AHLIC to), promptly following the delivery of
such Monthly Asset Value Statement to Purchaser pursuant to Section
5.11(a)(i), acquire or, subject to Section 5.11(c) below, designate for  

  

 ![](exhibit21069.jpg) 

64 inclusion in the Specified Portfolio additional cash or Investment Assets
with an aggregate Fair Market Value equal to the amount of such shortfall.
(iii) If the Accounting Value of the Specified Portfolio set forth in a
Monthly Asset Value Statement is greater than the Adjusted Required Asset
Value set forth in such Monthly Asset Value Statement, Seller may, at its
option and in its sole discretion, select for removal from the Specified
Portfolio cash or Investment Assets that have an aggregate Accounting Value
equal to such excess as follows (clauses (A) and (B) below, the "Selection
Waterfall"): (A) cash and cash equivalents in the Specified Portfolio will be
selected first; and (B) otherwise, Investment Assets will be selected in an
order of shortest stated maturity to longest stated maturity, determined in
each case in good faith by Seller. (iv) Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary in this Agreement, Seller may (and may cause the Ceding Company or
AHLIC to) sell any Investment Asset in the Specified Portfolio if Seller
determines in good faith that such Investment Asset has become, or is
reasonably likely to become, impaired. In the event of any such sale of an
impaired asset, Seller shall (or shall cause the Ceding Company or AHLIC to),
as promptly as practicable following such sale (with a target of within one
Business Day), acquire or designate for inclusion in the Specified Portfolio
cash or replacement Investment Assets with an aggregate Fair Market Value
equal to the Accounting Value of the Investment Asset sold in such sale,
determined prior to any adjustment as a result of the impairment. For the
avoidance of doubt, the Capital Gain or Loss Adjustment (as defined in clause
(b) below) does not apply to sales of Investment Asset pursuant to this
Section 5.11(a)(iv), but the Reallocated Asset Value Adjustment (as defined
in Section 5.11(c) below) does apply to any Reallocated Investment Asset
that replaces such an Investment Asset. (v) Any changes to the Specified
Portfolio contemplated by this Section 5.11(a) will be effected in accordance
with Pre-Closing Investment Guidelines. (b) Discretionary Turnover
Allowance. (i) Between the date hereof and the Closing Date, Seller may, at
its option and in its sole discretion, sell: (A) any bond in the Specified
Portfolio that has an option adjusted duration of 3.00 years or less as of
the close of business on the Business Day immediately prior to the date on
which it is sold,  

  

 ![](exhibit21070.jpg) 

65 determined in accordance with the OAD model provided by Bloomberg L.P.'s
Portfolio and Risk Analytics solution (PORT); and (B) an additional (x) 5% of
the aggregate Specified Portfolio (where such percentage is determined by
reference to the Accounting Value of the Specified Portfolio as of the
Reference Date and sales are measured by Accounting Value of the sold
Investment Assets as of the applicable sale dates) during the period between
the Reference Date through December 31, 2017; and (y) if the Closing has not
occurred on or prior to December 31, 2017, 1% of the Specified Portfolio
(where such percentage is determined by reference to the Accounting Value of
the Specified Portfolio as of the beginning of each applicable month and
sales are measured by Accounting Value of the sold Investment Assets as of
the applicable sale dates) during each calendar month, or portion thereof,
that between December 31, 2017 and the Closing (this Section 5.11(b)(i)
collectively, the "Discretionary Turnover Allowance"); provided, however,
that the sales described in (A) and (B) above may not, in the aggregate,
exceed 10% of the Specified Portfolio through November 30, 2017, plus 2% of
the Specified Portfolio for every calendar month after November 2017. (ii)
On the date that any Investment Asset in the Specified Portfolio is sold
pursuant to this Section 5.11(b), the Adjusted Required Asset Value as of
such date will, in addition to any adjustment to the Required Asset Value
required under the Transaction Accounting Principles to account for any
change in the interest maintenance reserve of the Ceding Company or AHLIC, as
applicable, resulting from such sale, be adjusted as set forth below (each of
the adjustments described in (A) and (B) below, a "Capital Gain or Loss
Adjustment"): (A) if the sale of the Investment Asset generates a (statutory
basis) capital gain (calculated as the excess, if any, of the FMV Ex- Accrued
of such Investment Asset as of the applicable date of sale over the Book
Value of such Investment Asset as of such date), the Adjusted Required Asset
Value as of such date will be increased by the amount of such capital gain,
less the amount of any interest maintenance reserve of the Ceding Company or
AHLIC, as applicable, generated by the sale of such asset in accordance with
the Transaction Accounting Principles; and (B) if the sale of the Investment
Asset generates a (statutory basis) capital loss (calculated as the excess,
if any, of the Book Value of such Investment Asset as of the applicable date
of sale over the  

  

 ![](exhibit21071.jpg) 

66 FMV Ex-Accrued of such Investment Asset as of such date), the Adjusted
Required Asset Value as of such date will be decreased by an amount equal to
(A) the absolute value of such capital loss minus (B) the absolute value of
any decrease in interest maintenance reserve of the Ceding Company or AHLIC,
as applicable, resulting from the sale of such asset in accordance with the
Transaction Accounting Principles. (iii) In the event that Seller elects to
sell any Investment Asset pursuant to this Section 5.11(b), Seller shall, as
promptly as reasonably practicable (with a target of within one Business Day)
reinvest the gross proceeds it receives from such sale (less the amount of
such gross proceeds that is attributable to accrued but unpaid interest on
such Investment Asset) in the Specified Portfolio by either acquiring one or
more new Investment Assets or, subject to Section 5.11(c) below, selecting
for inclusion in the Specified Portfolio one or more Reallocated Investment
Assets, in each case that have an aggregate FMV Ex-Accrued equal to the
amount of such gross proceeds (less the amount of such gross proceeds that is
attributable to accrued but unpaid interest on such Investment Asset). (iv)
Any changes to the Specified Portfolio contemplated by this Section 5.11(b)
will be effected in accordance with the Pre-Closing Investment Guidelines.
(c) Reallocated Investment Assets. If, between the date of this Agreement and
the Closing Date, any Reallocated Investment Asset is designated for
inclusion in the Specified Portfolio pursuant to Section 5.11(a) or Section
5.11(b), then the following adjustment shall be made to the Adjusted Required
Asset Value as of the date of such designation (each of the adjustments
described in (i) and (ii) below, a "Reallocated Asset Value Adjustment"): (i)
if the FMV Ex-Accrued of the Reallocated Investment Asset as of such date
exceeds the Book Value of such Reallocated Investment Assets as of such date,
the Adjusted Required Asset Value shall be decreased by the amount of such
excess; and (ii) if the FMV Ex-Accrued of the Reallocated Investment Asset as
of such date is less than the Book Value of such Reallocated Investment Asset
as of such date, the Adjusted Required Asset Value shall be increased by the
amount of such shortfall. Section 5.12. Properties. (a) Schedule VI hereto
sets forth all real property at which Employees of the Business use space for
the current operation and conduct of the Business (collectively, the
"Properties"). The Properties are separated on Schedule VI into the following
two (2) categories: (1) the Properties that Seller intends, and agrees to
cooperate as required in Section 5.12(b) to enable, Purchaser and such
Employees to have the right to occupy or use (in the case  

  

 ![](exhibit21072.jpg) 

67 of the Subleases, on a co-location basis with Seller, its Affiliates and
their respective employees) from and after the day immediately following the
expiration or termination of the Employee Lease Term pursuant to the Portland
Location Assignment Agreement, the Subleases and the Hartford License
Agreement (collectively, the "Occupied Properties"); and (2) the Properties
that Purchaser and such Employees will not have the right to occupy or use
from and after the day immediately following the expiration of the Employee
Lease Term (collectively, the "Non- Occupied Properties"). Purchaser
acknowledges and agrees that all Employees at the Non- Occupied Properties
shall vacate the Non-Occupied Properties from and after the day immediately
following the expiration of the Employee Lease Term and Purchaser shall cause
such Employees' job location to either be a home-office or an alternative real
estate solution other than the Non-Occupied Properties. The Employees' job
location between the Closing Date and the expiration of the Employee Lease
Term shall remain at the Properties pursuant to the Employee Leasing
Agreement. (b) Seller and Purchaser shall, and shall cause their respective
Affiliates to, use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain, on or prior to
December 31, 2017, the required consent of (i) the landlord of the Portland
Location to the assignment of the Assigned Lease pursuant to the Portland
Location Assignment Agreement and (ii) the respective landlords of the other
Occupied Properties to the subleasing of such locations to Purchaser pursuant
to the Subleases, in each case, on the terms and subject to the conditions
set forth herein and therein (collectively, the "Lease Consents"). Seller and
Purchaser shall cooperate with each other as may be reasonably required to
obtain the Lease Consents. (c) If any such Lease Consent is not obtained on
or prior to December 31, 2017, then, (i) the Portland Location Assignment
Agreement and/or any applicable Sublease to which such Lease Consent was not
obtained shall not become effective as of the expiration or termination of
the Employee Lease Term and (ii) Purchaser shall, and shall cause its
Affiliates to, obtain alternative office space, at its sole cost and expense,
and vacate the applicable Occupied Properties for which a Lease Consent has
not been obtained prior to the expiration of the Employee Lease Term for such
applicable Occupied Properties as provided for in this Section 5.12(c).
Section 5.13. Non-Competition. During the period beginning on the Closing Date
and ending on the date that is three years and six months after the Closing
Date (the "Restricted Period"), Seller shall not, and shall cause its
Affiliates (together with Seller, the "Restricted Entities") not to, directly
or indirectly, issue or sell in any state or jurisdiction within the United
States, any products or services of a type that comprises part of the Business
as of the date hereof and that was underwritten, issued, sold, renewed or
serviced as part of the Business during the two years prior to the date
hereof (the "Competing Businesses"); provided, however, that this Section
5.13 shall not prohibit or in any way prevent or restrict: (a) any Restricted
Entity from operating any business other than the Business (including the
business described in the proviso included in the definition of "Business") or
from operating the Business from and after the time at which the Business or
any portion thereof is recaptured under any coinsurance agreement;  

  

 ![](exhibit21073.jpg) 

68 (b) any Restricted Entity from providing (i) provider network access or
network management services; (ii) medical management, case management, or
cost containment services; or (iii) administrative services for short-term
disability plans that are provided in conjunction with a self-funded plan
sponsor's medical benefits coverage or plan that is administered or serviced
by a Restricted Entity. (c) any Restricted Entity from performing any act or
conducting any business expressly required by this Agreement or any other
Transaction Agreement; (d) any Restricted Entity from entering into a
reinsurance agreement or similar arrangement primarily reinsuring the
Competing Business of a ceding company that is not a Restricted Entity, so
long as none of the Restricted Entities engages in the issuing, underwriting,
selling, distributing, marketing, delivering, cancelling or administering of
such underlying reinsured business; (e) any Restricted Entity from (A)
making any investment or providing advisory services (or activities related
thereto) in a fiduciary or agency capacity and carried out on behalf of
clients or other third party beneficiaries in the ordinary course of business,
or (B) making passive investments for general insurance accounts or
investment management, proprietary investing or trading activities in the
ordinary course of its businesses; provided that in no event shall the
aggregate ownership interest held by Restricted Entities in any Person engaged
in a Competing Business, whether directly or indirectly, equal or exceed 20%
of the aggregate voting power or issued and outstanding equity securities of
such Person, subject to Sections 5.13(f) and (g) below; (f) the ownership
of, any affiliation with, or the conduct of any other activity with respect
to, a Person that conducts, either directly or indirectly, a Competing
Business (any such person, together with all of its Affiliates, a "Competing
Person") that is the result of (A) the merger, consolidation, share exchange,
sale or purchase of assets, scheme of arrangement or similar business
combination involving any Restricted Entity with any Competing Person or (B)
the acquisition of 20% or more of the voting power or outstanding equity
interests in any Competing Person by any Restricted Entity, if, in the case
of either (A) or (B), at least 66 2/3% of the total consolidated revenues of
such Competing Person in the calendar year prior to such ownership or
affiliation was derived from activities that do not constitute Competing
Business; provided, however, that such Restricted Entity may proceed with
such acquisition of a Competing Person that derived in excess of 33 1/3% of
its total consolidated revenues in its most recent fiscal year from
activities that constitute Competing Business only if such Restricted Entity
divests, within 24 months of its acquisition, a sufficient portion of such
Competing Person such that the total consolidated revenues from activities
that constitute Competing Business that remain with any such Competing Person
after such divestment over the last four full fiscal quarters prior to such
acquisition are not greater than 33 1/3% of its consolidated revenues for
such period; or (g) subject to the foregoing clause (f), any Restricted
Entity from foreclosing on collateral of or acquiring any of the outstanding
capital stock or other interests in any person that has outstanding
indebtedness to any Restricted Entity, or engaging in any activities otherwise  

  

 ![](exhibit21074.jpg) 

69 prohibited by this Section 5.13 in connection with any such Person as a
result of the acquisition of such capital stock or other interests in
connection with a debt previously contracted. ARTICLE VI. EMPLOYEE MATTERS
Section 6.01. Employee Matters. (a) Except as set forth in Section 6.01(b),
Purchaser or its Affiliate shall, not more than 30 Business Days following
the Closing Date, extend offers of employment ("Transfer Offers") to all
then-current Employees. Section 6.01(a)(i) of the Seller Disclosure Schedule
sets forth, as of the date hereof, a list of then-current Employees, together
with such Employees' (i) current base salary (or wages), (ii) current target
incentive compensation opportunities by component, including (1) target
annual cash bonus opportunity, (2) commission opportunity, and (3) target
long-term incentive opportunity, (iii) recognized years of service, (iv)
current work address, (v) remote work arrangement, if any, (vi) exempt or
non-exempt status, (vii) hourly or salaried status, (viii) annual paid time
off accrual rate, (ix) paid time off carryover amount, (x) current job title
and career level, (xi) date of hire, (xii) valid work email address, and
(xiii) status as active or on leave. Seller shall promptly update Section
6.01(a)(i) of the Seller Disclosure Schedule between the date hereof and the
expiration of the Employee Lease Term to reflect any new hires, transfers,
resignations and other employment additions and terminations of Employees
which may have occurred subsequent to the date hereof in the ordinary course
of business of the Business and shall deliver to Purchaser (A) a Closing
version of Section 6.01(a)(i) of the Seller Disclosure Schedule no later than
two days prior to the Closing Date, and (B) a final version of Section
6.01(a)(i) of the Seller Disclosure Schedule no later than 10 Business Days
prior to the expiration of the Employee Lease Term. Notwithstanding anything
to the contrary herein, to the extent an individual is hired or otherwise
retained at the direction of Purchaser and added to Section 6.01(a)(i) of the
Seller Disclosure Schedule after the date hereof, Purchaser or its Affiliate
shall extend a Transfer Offer to such Employee as soon as reasonably
practicable following such addition, but not more than the later to occur of
(x) 30 Business Days following the Closing Date, and (y) ten Business Days
following such addition. Section 6.01(a)(ii) of the Seller Disclosure
Schedule sets forth, as of the date hereof, a list of then current Business
Employees on a no-name basis by each Business Employee's current job title.
(b) With respect to any Employee identified on Section 6.01(a) of the Seller
Disclosure Schedule hereto who is not actively at work upon the expiration of
the Employee Lease Term as a result of a leave of absence (including
temporary leave for purposes of jury or military duty, maternity or paternity
leave, leave under the Family Medical Leave Act of 1993, approved personal
leave or disability or medical leave) (each, a "Leave Recipient"), Purchaser
shall make an offer of employment in the manner required by this Section 6.01,
contingent on such Leave Recipient's return to active status within six
months following the expiration of the Employee Lease Term or such longer
period as required by Applicable Law; provided that, notwithstanding anything
in this Agreement to the contrary, Purchaser shall not be required to make an
offer of employment to any such Employee (and shall have no obligation of any
nature to hire or employ any such Employee) who is receiving long-term
disability benefits. When a Leave Recipient who has accepted the offer
returns to active status pursuant to the terms hereof  

  

 ![](exhibit21075.jpg) 

70 and commences active employment with Purchaser or its Affiliates, such
Leave Recipient shall be considered a Transferred Employee. Purchaser shall
take, or cause its Affiliates to take, all reasonably necessary steps to
sponsor or transfer sponsorship of, the work permits for all Employees who
are foreign nationals listed in Section 3.10(j) of the Seller Disclosure
Schedule on or after the expiration of the Employee Lease Term. Seller shall
cooperate as reasonably necessary to effect Purchaser's or its Affiliates'
sponsorship or transfer of sponsorship of all such foreign national
Employees, in each case, to the extent permitted by Applicable Law. Each such
foreign national Employee who accepted an offer of employment from Purchaser
or an Affiliate pursuant to the terms hereof shall be considered a
Transferred Employee on the later of the Transfer Date or the date such
Employee obtains the necessary authorization to work for Purchaser and its
Affiliates and commences active employment with Purchaser and its Affiliates.
(c) Purchaser or its Affiliate shall set forth in the Transfer Offers the
proposed terms of employment (or service) for the Employees and, as of the
expiration of the Employee Lease Term and for a period of 12 months
immediately following the expiration of the Employee Lease Term (or such
earlier date on which such Employee's employment with Purchaser or its
Affiliate terminates), Purchaser or its Affiliate shall provide each
Transferred Employee with the following terms of employment (or service): (i)
base salary (or wages) no less than the base salary (or wages) provided to
such Employee by Seller or its Affiliates immediately prior to the Closing
Date, or, if later, as of the Employee's date of hire; (ii) annual incentive
opportunities no less than those provided by Seller or its Affiliates
immediately prior to the Closing Date, or, if later, as of the Employee's
date of hire, (iii) a long-term incentive compensation opportunity (whether
paid in cash or equity) at a similar range and participation rate to that
provided to such Employee by Seller or its Affiliates immediately prior to
the Closing Date or, if later, as of the Employee's date of hire; (iv)
commission opportunities that are no less than those provided to such
Employee by Seller or its Affiliates immediately prior to the Closing Date or,
if later, as of the Employee's date of hire, including, with respect to each
individual set forth on Section 6.01(c) of the Seller Disclosure Schedule
(each, a "Listed Sales Employee"), guaranteed commission opportunities
consistent with the terms of the retention letter with each such Listed Sales
Employee set forth on Section 3.10(a) of the Seller Disclosure Schedule, but
in each case to be paid consistent with Purchaser's or its Affiliate's
standard payroll cycle; (iii) employee retirement and welfare (including paid
time off) benefits, in each case, substantially similar to those provided to
similarly-situated employees of Purchaser or its Affiliate; and (iv) with
respect to Employees whose job location is a home-office as of the Closing
Date, the ability to continue to work from such home-office, and with respect
to all other Employees, a job location that does not increase such Employee's
commute by more than 30 miles when compared to the commute from such
Employee's residence to the job location to which such Employee reports
immediately prior to the expiration of the Closing Date, or if later, as of
the Employee's date of hire, or provide the Employee the ability to work from
a home-office. Without limiting the foregoing, Purchaser hereby acknowledges
and agrees that if the Employee Lease Term extends past Lessee's regularly
scheduled long-term incentive grant date in the first quarter of calendar year
2018, Purchaser shall, during the first "open window" trading period following
the expiration of the Employee Lease Term, grant an award to each Transferred
Employee who is eligible to earn a long-term incentive award for calendar
year 2018. Employment or service, as applicable, pursuant to a Transfer Offer
shall be contingent upon such Employee (i) being employed by (or providing
on-going services with) Seller or any of its Subsidiaries immediately prior to  

  

 ![](exhibit21076.jpg) 

71 expiration of the Employee Lease Term, (ii) satisfying required
professional licensure requirements (to the extent applicable), (iii)
successfully completing a background check, I-9 form/eVerify process, and all
applicable Purchaser new hire documentation and (iv) with respect to
Employees who are foreign nationals, obtaining the necessary authorization to
work for Purchaser or its Affiliates within six (6) months of the expiration
of the Employee Lease Term. All employment offers shall be for employment at-
will and nothing in this Article VI shall require Purchaser or any of its
Affiliates to continue to employ any Transferred Employee for any specified
period of time following the expiration of the Employee Lease Term. Except as
set forth in Section 6.01(b), each Employee who accepts Purchaser's Transfer
Offer shall be a "Transferred Employee" at 12:00:01 a.m. on the first day
following the expiration of the Employee Lease Term. Effective as of the date
they become Transferred Employees (the "Transfer Date"), such Transferred
Employees shall cease to be employees of Seller and its Affiliates and shall
cease any further participation in (and shall cease to accrue benefits under)
Employee Benefit Plans, subject to the terms and conditions of the Employee
Benefit Plans and Applicable Law. (d) As of the expiration of the Employee
Lease Term, in no event shall any Employee be entitled to accrue any benefits
under the Employee Benefit Plans with respect to services rendered or
compensation paid on or after the expiration of the Employee Lease Term,
subject to the terms and conditions of the Employee Benefit Plans and
Applicable Law. (e) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the
contrary, any Transferred Employee who incurs a termination of employment
during the 12-month period immediately following the expiration of the
Employee Lease Term shall be entitled to receive severance payments and
benefits that are no less favorable than the severance payments and benefits
provided to similarly-situated employees of Purchaser or its Affiliates under
the Purchaser severance plan as in effect immediately prior to the date
hereof and set forth on Section 6.01(e) of the Seller Disclosure Schedule;
provided, however, that in lieu of the thirty (30) day paid notice period
applicable to similarly-situated employees of Purchaser, Transferred Employees
will be entitled to a nine (9) week paid non-working period with benefits
continuation during such period. (f) Notwithstanding anything in this
Agreement to the contrary, Purchaser or its Affiliate shall be solely
responsible for all Liabilities arising from, related to or based upon the
termination of any Employee who is terminated by Seller or its respective
Affiliates on or after the expiration of the Employee Lease Term in the event
such employee is not offered employment or service with Purchaser in
accordance with the provisions of this Section 6.01. Purchaser or its
Affiliate shall be solely responsible for providing all notices required under
the Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification Act, 29 U.S.C. § 2109 et
seq., or the regulations promulgated thereunder (the "WARN Act") (including
comparable state, local or other Applicable Laws) and for taking all remedial
measures, including, without limitation, the payment of all amounts,
penalties, liabilities, costs and expenses if such notices are not provided,
with respect to any obligations under the WARN Act (including comparable
state, local or other Applicable Laws) arising out of or resulting from any
termination of employment of any Transferred Employees by Purchaser and its
Affiliates on or after the expiration of the Employee Lease Term.  

  

 ![](exhibit21077.jpg) 

72 (g) Purchaser shall cause its Affiliate to: (i) permit each Transferred
Employee participating in each Employee Benefit Plan that is a defined
contribution plan with a qualified cash or deferred arrangement within the
meaning of Section 401(k) of the Code (the "Seller 401(k) Plan") to effect,
and (ii) cause its defined contribution plan that includes a qualified cash
or deferred arrangement within the meaning of Section 401(k) of the Code (the
"Purchaser 401(k) Plan") to accept, in accordance with Applicable Law, a
"direct rollover" (within the meaning of Section 401(a)(31) of the Code) of
his or her account balances (including earnings thereon through the date of
transfer) under the Seller 401(k) Plan if such rollover to the Purchaser
401(k) Plan is elected in accordance with Applicable Law by such Transferred
Employee. (h) Subject to any reimbursement or other obligations of Purchaser
or its Affiliates agreed upon pursuant to the Employee Leasing Agreement,
Seller shall retain responsibility for all liabilities under and with respect
to, and claims incurred under, the Employee Benefit Plans (including those
relating to Transferred Employees and their covered dependents). Purchaser or
its Affiliate shall be responsible for all liabilities under and with respect
to, and claims incurred under, any employee benefit plans, programs, policies
and arrangements maintained by Purchaser or its Affiliates (including those
relating to Transferred Employees and their covered dependents). (i) Unless
Seller or one of its Affiliates is required under Applicable Law to make a
payment in settlement of accrued paid time off of a Transferred Employee, (i)
Purchaser or its Affiliate shall assume, recognize and provide each
Transferred Employee up to forty (40) hours of the Transferred Employee's
earned but unused paid time-off as of the expiration of the Employee Lease
Term as determined under Seller's policy in effect as of the expiration of the
Employee Lease Term and (ii) Seller or one of its Affiliates shall make a
payment in settlement of accrued paid time off of any such Transferred
Employee in excess of forty (40) hours in accordance with Seller's paid time
off policy and Applicable Law. (j) Purchaser or its Affiliate shall assume
and pay, the accrued but unpaid annual cash bonuses with respect to
performance in the calendar year ending December 31, 2017. In respect
thereof, the following shall be accrued on the Initial Closing Statement: (i)
accruals for ten-twelfths (10/12) of such annual cash bonuses, assuming
maximum (140%) performance, and (ii) accruals representing the matching
contribution that would have been made under Seller 401(k) Plan with respect
to the bonus amounts accrued pursuant to Section 6.01(j)(i). In no event
shall the amount of such payment by Purchaser to the Transferred Employees in
the aggregate be less than the aggregate amount set forth with respect to
such bonuses in the Initial Closing Statement as described in Section
6.01(j)(i). (k) Purchaser shall, or shall cause one of its Affiliates to,
make available to the Transferred Employees a flex spending account plan for
medical and dependent care expenses under a new or existing plan established
or maintained under Section 125 and Section 129 of the Code (the "Purchaser
FSA"), effective as of the expiration of the Employee Lease Term and in
accordance with this Section 6.01(k). If the Employee Lease Term ends after
December 31, 2017, Purchaser, or one of its Affiliates, shall credit the
applicable account under the Purchaser FSA of each Transferred Employee
participating in the Seller Employee Benefit Plan maintained pursuant to
Section 125 and Section 129 of the Code (the "Seller FSA") with an amount  

  

 ![](exhibit21078.jpg) 

73 the balance of such Transferred Employee's account under the Seller FSA
immediately prior to the expiration of the Employee Lease Term, in accordance
with the following: (i) If the aggregate amount withheld from Transferred
Employees' compensation under the Seller FSA for 2018 exceeds the aggregate
amount of reimbursements paid to Transferred Employees prior to the
expiration of the Employee Lease Term under the Seller FSA for claims
incurred in 2018, Seller shall transfer (or cause to be transferred) to
Purchaser within 30 days after the expiration of the Employee Lease Term a
cash payment equal to such excess, if any. (ii) If the aggregate amount of
reimbursements paid to Transferred Employees prior to the expiration of the
Employee Lease Term under the Seller FSA for claims incurred in 2018 exceeds
the aggregate amount withheld from Transferred Employees' compensation under
the Seller FSA for 2018 prior to the expiration of the Employee Lease Term,
Purchaser shall transfer (or cause to be transferred) to Seller within 30
days after the expiration of the Employee Lease Term a cash payment equal to
such excess, if any. (iii) In each case, Purchaser shall assume and be
solely responsible for all claims for reimbursement by Transferred Employees
for 2018 that have not been paid in full as of the expiration of the Employee
Lease Term, which claims shall be paid pursuant to and under the terms of the
Purchaser FSA, and Purchaser shall indemnify and hold harmless Seller and its
Affiliates from any and all claims by or with respect to Transferred
Employees for reimbursement under the Seller FSA that have not been paid in
full as of the expiration of the Employee Lease Term; provided, however, that
the foregoing indemnification shall not apply to any claims that were
adjudicated under the terms of the Seller FSA on or prior to the expiration
of the Employee Lease Term. Purchaser agrees to cause the Purchaser FSA to
honor through the end of the calendar year in which the Employee Lease Term
expires the elections made by each Transferred Employee under the Seller FSA
in respect of the flexible spending reimbursement accounts under the
Purchaser FSA that are in effect immediately prior to the expiration of the
Employee Lease Term, subject to each Transferred Employee's ability to adjust
such elections pursuant to the terms of the Purchaser FSA. For the avoidance
of doubt, except as provided herein, (A) in no event shall Seller or any of
its Affiliates have any liability or obligation under the Purchaser FSA, and
(B) any Transferred Employee who elects coverage under a high deductible
health plan may be ineligible to make continuing elections under the
Purchaser health care FSA pursuant to the terms of such plans. For the
avoidance of doubt, if the Employee Lease Term ends on December 31, 2017,
Purchaser shall have no obligation to provide credits as described in this
Section 6.01(k).  

  

 ![](exhibit21079.jpg) 

74 (l) In respect of each Employee who becomes a Transferred Employee, Seller
and Purchaser shall adopt the "standard procedure" for preparing and filing
IRS Forms W-2 (Wage and Tax Statements), as described in Revenue Procedure
2004-53. Under this procedure, Purchaser, as successor employer, shall
provide, as applicable, all required Forms W-2 to all Employees who become
Transferred Employees reflecting only wages paid and Taxes withheld by
Purchaser and its Affiliates as the successor employer. In addition, Seller
and Purchaser shall adopt the "standard procedure" of Revenue Procedure
2004-53 for purposes of filing IRS Forms W-4 (Employee's Withholding
Allowance Certificate) and W-5 (Earned Income Credit Advance Payment
Certificate). (m) Purchaser or one of its Affiliates shall grant during the
first "open window" trading period following the expiration of the Employee
Lease Term new awards, payable in cash or in stock (each, a "New Award"),
vesting over two (2) years, to each Transferred Employee who, as a result of
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, forfeits restricted share
units, performance share units or stock appreciation rights that were granted
pursuant to any Employee Benefit Plan prior to the date hereof and are not
vested as of the expiration of the Employee Lease Term (each, a "Seller
Forfeited Equity Award"). The value of the New Awards will be no less than
the value of the Seller Forfeited Equity Awards, both individually and in the
aggregate. Seller shall provide Purchaser with a schedule of the value of each
Seller Forfeited Equity Award as soon as practicable following the
termination of the Employee Lease Term. (n) Purchaser agrees to cause its
Affiliate to (i) provide coverage for the Transferred Employees under its
employee benefit plans as of the applicable Transfer Date, (ii) waive any
preexisting conditions, waiting periods and actively at work requirements
under such plans and (iii) cause such plans to honor any expenses incurred by
the Transferred Employees and their beneficiaries under similar Employee
Benefit Plans during the portion of the calendar year in which the Transfer
Date occurs for purposes of satisfying applicable deductible, co-insurance
and maximum out-of-pocket expenses. Transferred Employees shall be given
credit under each employee benefit plan, program, policy or arrangement of
Purchaser in which the Transferred Employees are eligible to participate for
all service with Seller (to the extent such credit was given by the
applicable Employee Benefit Plan) for all purposes (except that no benefit
accrual will be provided under any defined benefit pension plans), except to
the extent it would result in a duplication of benefits. (o) The parties
hereto shall coordinate with each other prior to the Closing Date as to the
form and content of any material, broad based communication from Purchaser or
any of its Affiliates to the Employees. Seller acknowledges, understands and
agrees, on behalf of itself and its Affiliates, that Purchaser shall, from
the date hereof, be allowed to approach and meet with all Employees. Seller
and its Affiliates shall permit Purchaser reasonable access to all Employees;
provided, that such access shall not interfere with the operations of the
Business, and that when on Seller premises, Purchaser shall abide by any
Seller security protocols. In no event shall Purchaser or any of its
employees have access to the systems of Seller. (p) Seller, Purchaser and
their respective Affiliates shall promptly take all steps necessary to
fulfill their obligations, and to cause their applicable employee benefit
plans to fulfill the obligations that Seller and Purchaser have agreed to
pursuant to this Section 6.01. All transfers of information required by this
Section 6.01 shall be made at the time and in the manner  

  

 ![](exhibit21080.jpg) 

75 (including applicable file format) as reasonably requested by Purchaser or
its applicable vendor. In furtherance thereof, Seller shall provide to
Purchaser a complete employee data file, in the format and with the elements
prescribed by Purchaser, no later than October 23, 2017. (q) Seller shall be
solely responsible for and shall discharge all retention bonuses under
Business Employee Benefit Plans that become vested at or prior to the
termination of the Employee Lease Term ("Seller Retention Bonus
Liabilities"). Section 6.02. No Third Party Beneficiaries. Notwithstanding
the provisions of this Article VI, this Article VI is not intended to and
shall not (a) create any third party rights, (b) amend any Employee Benefit
Plan or Business Employee Benefit Plan, (iii) require Purchaser or any of its
Affiliates to continue any Business Employee Benefit Plan beyond the time when
it otherwise lawfully could be terminated or modified, or (d) require
Purchaser or any of its Affiliates to continue to employ any Transferred
Employee for any specified period, or (e) provide any Transferred Employee
with any rights to continued employment, severance pay or similar benefits
following any termination of employment. ARTICLE VII. TAX MATTERS Section
7.01. Allocation of Consideration. In addition to the allocation of the
Purchase Price contemplated by Article II, Seller and Purchaser shall further
allocate the Purchase Price, as finally determined pursuant to Article II,
and any other applicable consideration (the "Allocable Amount") in accordance
with the requirements of Section 1060 of the Code (and the regulations
promulgated thereunder) for all Tax purposes; provided that such allocation
for Tax purposes shall be consistent with the allocation of the Purchase
Price as contemplated by Article II. As soon as practicable following the
date on which the Final Closing Statement becomes final and binding on the
parties pursuant to Section 2.09(f), Seller shall prepare a schedule
reflecting the allocation of the Allocable Amount and shall submit such
allocation to Purchaser for review. Purchaser and Seller shall use
commercially reasonable efforts to agree on the amount and proper allocation
of the Allocable Amount in accordance with Section 1060 of the Code. If
Seller and Purchaser have not agreed on the allocation within 90 calendar days
after the date on which the Final Closing Statement become final and binding
on the parties pursuant to Section 2.09(f), then Purchaser and Seller shall
each have the right to deliver notice to the other party of its intent to
refer the matter for resolution to the Independent Accountant. Purchaser and
Seller will each deliver to the other and to the Independent Accountant a
notice setting forth in reasonable detail their proposed allocations. Within
30 days after receipt thereof, the Independent Accountant will deliver the
allocation schedule and provide a written description of the basis for its
determination of the allocations therein (such allocations, whether agreed to
by Purchaser and Seller or determined by the Independent Accountant (the
"Final Allocation") shall be final, binding and conclusive on Purchaser and
Seller and the parties will report, and will cause their respective
Affiliates to report, the federal, state, local and other Tax consequences of
the transactions, including the filing of Internal Revenue Service Form 8594,
in a manner consistent with such Final Allocation). One-half of all fees,
costs and expenses of retaining the Independent Accountant shall be borne by
Seller and one-half of such fees, costs and expenses of  

  

 ![](exhibit21081.jpg) 

76 retaining the Independent Accountant shall be borne by Purchaser. Each
party will bear the costs of its own counsel, witnesses (if any) and
employees. Section 7.02. Transfer Taxes. Any Transfer Taxes shall be borne
fifty percent (50%) by Seller and fifty percent (50%) by Purchaser. Seller
and Purchaser shall cooperate in (a) determining the amount of Transfer
Taxes, (b) obtaining any relief, exemption or refund of any such Transfer
Tax, (c) preparing and timely filing any and all required Tax Returns for or
with respect to such Transfer Taxes with any and all appropriate Tax
authorities, (d) promptly providing the other party with evidence that such
Transfer Taxes have been paid, and (e) promptly reimbursing the other party
for fifty percent (50%) of such Transfer Taxes, as applicable. "Transfer

transfer, goods and services, provincial sales, harmonized sales, excise, real
estate, stock transfer, intangible property transfer, personal property
transfer, gross receipts, registration, securities transactions, conveyance
and notarial Taxes, and similar fees, Taxes and governmental charges
(together with any interest, penalty, addition to Tax, and additional amount
imposed in respect thereof) arising out of or in connection with the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Section 7.03. Cooperation and
Exchange of Information. Seller and Purchaser shall provide each other with
such cooperation and information as either of them or their respective
Affiliates may reasonably request of the other in filing any Tax Return,
amended Tax Return or claim for Tax refund, determining a liability for Taxes
or a right to a Tax refund, or participating in or conducting any contest in
respect of Taxes (a "Tax Contest"). Such cooperation and information shall
include providing copies of relevant Tax Returns or portions thereof, together
with accompanying schedules, related work papers and documents relating to
rulings or other determinations by Tax Authorities. Each party and its
Affiliates shall make its employees available on a basis mutually convenient
to both parties to provide explanations of any documents or information
provided hereunder. Each of Seller and Purchaser shall retain all Tax
Returns, schedules and work papers, records and other documents in its
possession relating to Tax matters of the Business for each Tax period first
ending after the Closing Date and for all prior Tax periods until the later
of (i) the expiration of the statute of limitations of the Tax period to
which such Tax Returns and other documents relate, without regard to
extensions except to the extent notified in writing of such extensions for
the respective Tax periods, and (ii) three years following the due date
(without extension) for such Tax Returns. Any information obtained under this
Section 7.03 shall be kept confidential except as otherwise may be necessary
in connection with the filing of Tax Returns or claims for Tax refunds or in
conducting a contest or as otherwise may be required by Applicable Law or the
rules of any stock exchange. Seller shall promptly notify Purchaser if, as a
result of the amendment of any Tax Return, any claim or assessment by any Tax
authority or any other cause, the Tax reserves in respect of the Ceded
Insurance Contracts no longer accurately reflect the reserves maintained by
Seller, the Ceding Company of any of its Affiliates as of the Closing Date
(immediately prior to the Closing) with respect to the Ceded Insurance
Contracts, and shall provide Purchaser updated information of such reserves.
Upon receipt of such information, Purchaser shall provide Seller with a
revised Purchase Price allocation in accordance with the principles of
Section 7.01. Section 7.04. Miscellaneous. Seller and Purchaser agree to
treat all payments (other than interest on a payment) made by either of them
to or for the benefit of the other or the other's Affiliates under this
Article VII and under other indemnity provisions of this Agreement as  

  

 ![](exhibit21082.jpg)

shall govern for purposes hereof to the extent permissible under Applicable
Law. ARTICLE VIII. CONDITIONS TO CLOSING Section 8.01. Conditions to

 ![](exhibit21084.jpg) 

79 transactions contemplated hereby, and such order, injunction or decree
shall have become final and nonappealable; provided that prior to termination
under this Section 9.01(a), the party seeking to terminate this Agreement
shall have used best efforts to have such order, injunction or decree
vacated; (b) by either Seller or Purchaser in writing, if the Closing has not
occurred on or before February 1, 2018 (as it may be extended as contemplated
below or by Section 11.14, the "Outside Date"), unless the failure of the
Closing to occur is the result of a breach of this Agreement by the party
seeking to terminate this Agreement; provided that, if on the Outside Date
the condition set forth in Section 8.01(a) has not been satisfied then, upon
the written notice of Seller to Purchaser, the Outside Date shall be extended
to a date and time that is not later than 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on
March 31, 2018; (c) by either Seller or Purchaser (but only so long as Seller
or Purchaser, as applicable, is not in material breach of its obligations
under this Agreement) in writing, if a material breach of any provision of
this Agreement that has been committed by the other party would cause the
failure of any mutual condition to Closing or any condition to Closing for the
benefit of the non-breaching party and such breach is not subsequently waived
by the non- breaching party or capable of being cured or is not cured within
20 Business Days after the breaching party receives written notice from the
non-breaching party that the non-breaching party intends to terminate this
Agreement pursuant to this Section 9.01(c); (d) by Seller if, (i) except for
the condition in Section 8.03(c), all of the conditions set forth in Section

those conditions that by their terms are to be satisfied at the Closing, so
long as such conditions are capable of being satisfied at the Closing) and
(ii) the Closing has not occurred at the then most recent date on which it
was otherwise required to occur pursuant to Section 2.06 because the
condition set forth in Section 8.03(c) has not been satisfied; or (e) at any
time on or prior to the Closing Date, by mutual written consent of Seller and
Purchaser. Section 9.02. Termination Procedure. In the event of termination
by Purchaser or Seller pursuant to Section 9.01, written notice thereof shall

this Agreement shall be terminated, without further action by any party. If
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement are terminated as provided

 ![](exhibit21085.jpg) 

80 hereto shall have any liability to any other party hereto or their
respective Representatives, except as set forth in Section 5.04, this Article
IX and Article XI, which shall survive the termination hereof pursuant to
this Article IX; provided, however, that nothing in this Agreement shall
relieve any party hereto from liability for (x) any willful and material
breach of this Agreement prior to such termination or (y) fraud in the event
that such party is finally determined by a court of competent jurisdiction to
have willfully and knowingly committed a fraud, with specific intent to
deceive and mislead any other party, regarding such party's representations,
warranties, covenants or other agreements set forth in this Agreement;
provided, further, that any claim for fraud may only be brought against the
party that committed such fraud. For purposes hereof, "willful and material
breach" means a material breach by a party of the applicable provision of
this Agreement as a result of an action or failure to act by such Person that
it actually knew would result in a breach of this Agreement. ARTICLE X.
INDEMNIFICATION Section 10.01. Survival. (a) The representations and
warranties of Seller and Purchaser contained in this Agreement shall survive
the Closing solely for purposes of this Article X and shall terminate and
expire on the date that is 18 months following the Closing Date; provided,
that the Seller Specified Representations and the Purchaser Specified
Representations and the representations and warranties of Seller set forth in
Section 3.17 shall survive until the date that is 60 days following the
expiration of the applicable statute of limitations and the representations
and warranties of Seller set forth in Section 3.18(d) or Section 3.19 will
terminate and be of no further force and effect from and after the Closing.
Any claim for indemnification in respect of any representation or warranty
that is not asserted by notice given as required herein prior to the
expiration of the specified period of survival shall not be valid and any
right to indemnification is hereby irrevocably waived after the expiration of
such period of survival. Any claim properly made for an Indemnifiable Loss in
respect of such a breach asserted within such period of survival as herein
provided will be timely made for purposes hereof. (b) To the extent that it
is to be performed after the Closing, each covenant in this Agreement will,
for purposes of this Article X, survive and remain in effect in accordance
with its terms plus a period of six months thereafter, after which no claim
for indemnification with respect thereto may be brought hereunder. All
covenants in this Agreement that by their terms are required to be fully
performed prior to the Closing will, for purposes of this Article X, survive
and remain in effect until the date that is 18 months following the Closing
Date, after which time no claim for indemnification with respect thereto may
be brought hereunder; provided, however, that the covenants set forth in
Section 5.11 will terminate and be of no further force and effect from and
after the Closing. Section 10.02. Indemnification. (a) Seller shall
indemnify, defend and hold harmless Purchaser, its Affiliates and their
respective directors, officers and employees, successors and, in connection
with a sale of all  

  

 ![](exhibit21086.jpg) 

81 or substantially all of the group benefits business of Purchaser and its
Affiliates, assignees (provided, that in the case of any such sale during the
18-month period after the Closing, Seller shall have provided its consent to
such assignment) (collectively, the "Purchaser Indemnified Persons") from and
against any and all Indemnifiable Losses asserted against, imposed upon or
incurred or suffered by any Purchaser Indemnified Person resulting from or
arising out of: (i) any inaccuracy in or breach of any representation or
warranty of Seller made in this Agreement; (ii) any breach or non-
fulfillment of any agreement or covenant of Seller under this Agreement; or
(iii) any Excluded Liabilities including Excluded Taxes. (b) Purchaser shall
indemnify, defend and hold harmless Seller, its Affiliates and their
respective directors, officers and employees (collectively, the "Seller
Indemnified Persons") from and against any and all Indemnifiable Losses
asserted against, imposed upon or incurred or suffered by any Seller
Indemnified Person resulting from or arising out of: (i) any inaccuracy in or
breach of any representation or warranty of Purchaser made in this Agreement;
(ii) any breach or non-fulfillment of any agreement or covenant of Purchaser
under this Agreement; (iii) any Assumed Liability; or (iv) the operation of
the Business from and after the Closing Date (except to the extent such
Indemnifiable Loss is subject to indemnification by Seller of a Purchaser
Indemnified Person pursuant to Section 10.02(a)). (c) For purposes of
determining whether any representation and warranty (other than the
representations and warranties set forth in Section 3.06(a) and Section 3.22)
has any inaccuracy or been breached and the amount of any Indemnifiable
Losses under this Article X, each representation and warranty contained in
this Agreement shall be read without regard to any materiality or Material
Adverse Effect qualifier contained therein. Section 10.03. Certain
Limitations. (a) Except with respect to Indemnifiable Losses resulting from
Excluded Taxes or from any inaccuracy in or breach of a representation or
warranty set forth in Section 3.17, no party shall be obligated to indemnify
and hold harmless its respective Indemnitees under Section 10.02(a)(i) (in
the case of Seller, and other than with respect to an inaccuracy in or breach
of any Seller Specified Representation) or Section 10.02(b)(i) (in the case
of Purchaser, and other than with respect to an inaccuracy in or breach of
any Purchaser Specified Representation) (i) with respect to any claim or
series of claims arising out of substantially similar facts and
circumstances, unless such claim or series of claims involves Indemnifiable
Losses in excess of $100,000 (the "Threshold Amount") (nor shall any claim
that does not exceed the Threshold  

  

 ![](exhibit21087.jpg) 

82 Amount be applied to or considered for purposes of calculating the amount
of Indemnifiable Losses for which the Indemnitor is responsible under clause
(ii) below) and (ii) unless and until the aggregate amount of all
Indemnifiable Losses of the Indemnitees under Section 10.02(a)(i) or such
Section 10.02(b)(i), as the case may be, exceeds $14,500,000 for all
Indemnifiable Losses (the "Deductible"), at which point such Indemnitor shall
be liable to its respective Indemnitees for the value of the Indemnitee's
claims under Section 10.02(a)(i) (other than with respect to a breach of any
Seller Specified Representation) or Section 10.02(b)(i) (other than with
respect to a breach of any Purchaser Specified Representation), as the case
may be, that is in excess of the Deductible, subject to the limitations set
forth in this Article X; provided, however, that any Indemnifiable Losses of
the Purchaser Indemnified Persons resulting from or arising out of any
inaccuracy in or breach of any representation or warranty set forth in Section
3.03 shall not be subject to the Deductible, and the Threshold Amount for
such Indemnifiable Losses shall be $50,000; provided further that, for the
avoidance of doubt, any such Indemnifiable Losses shall be subject to the
Threshold Amount and the maximum aggregate liability set forth in the
following sentence prior to the proviso set forth therein. The maximum
aggregate liability of Seller, on the one hand, and Purchaser on the other
hand, to their respective Indemnitees for any and all Indemnifiable Losses
under Section 10.02(a)(i), in the case of Seller (other than with respect to
a breach of any Seller Specified Representation), or Sections 10.02(b)(i), in
the case of Purchaser (other than with respect to a breach of any Purchaser
Specified Representation), shall be $174,000,000; provided, that the maximum
aggregate liability of Seller to all Purchaser Indemnified Persons for any or
all Indemnifiable Losses under this Agreement shall not exceed the Purchase
Price. The limitations in this Section 10.03(a) shall not apply to claims made
under Section 10.02(a)(iii), Section 10.02(b)(iii) or Section 10.02(b)(iv).
(b) Each Indemnitee shall use commercially reasonable efforts to mitigate all
Indemnifiable Losses for which indemnification may be sought hereunder;
provided that the costs and expenses of such mitigation shall constitute
Indemnifiable Losses hereunder. (c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
herein, any Indemnifiable Losses resulting from or arising out of any breach
of any representation or warranty of Seller made in this Agreement in respect
of Taxes, including under Section 3.17, shall be limited to Taxes
attributable to Pre-Closing Periods. Section 10.04. Definitions. As used in
this Agreement: (i) "Indemnitee" means any Person entitled to indemnification
under this Agreement; (ii) "Indemnitor" means any Person required to provide
indemnification under this Agreement; (iii) "Indemnifiable Losses" means any
and all damages, losses, Liabilities, obligations, costs and expenses
(including reasonable attorneys' and other professional fees and expenses);
provided, that any Indemnity Payment (x) shall in no event include any
amounts constituting consequential or punitive damages, or any damages
calculated based on a loss of future revenue, income or profits, relating to
the breach or alleged breach of this  

  

 ![](exhibit21088.jpg) 

83 Agreement; provided, however, that notwithstanding the foregoing or
anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, Indemnifiable Losses
shall include recoveries for lost profits (including diminution in value used
by a trier of fact in determining lost profits) if and only if (A) such
damages for lost profits are recoverable under the laws of the State of New
York; (B) the Indemnitee satisfies all elements necessary for proof of such
damages for lost profits under such laws; and (C) such lost profits can be
demonstrated by reference to the Actuarial Report and, with respect to the
reduction or elimination of any profits contemplated by the Actuarial Report,
shall in no event exceed the present value ascribed to any such remaining
profits contemplated by the Actuarial Report as of the date of the
Indemnifiable Loss giving rise to the related claim, calculated based on the
assumptions on which the Actuarial Report was prepared and discounted using a
9% discount rate; provided, further, that the Purchaser Indemnified Persons
may recover lost profits only to the extent such lost profits are
attributable to the Business; and (y) shall be net of any amounts actually
recovered by the Indemnitee for the Indemnifiable Losses for which such
Indemnity Payment is made under any insurance policy, reinsurance agreement,
warranty or indemnity or otherwise from any Person other than a party hereto
(net of any actual costs, expenses or increases in premiums incurred as a
result of obtaining such proceeds), and the Indemnitee shall promptly
reimburse the Indemnitor for any such amount that is received by it from any
such other Person with respect to an Indemnifiable Losses after any
indemnification with respect thereto has actually been paid pursuant to this
Agreement; (iv) "Indemnity Payment" means any amount of Indemnifiable Losses
required to be paid pursuant to this Agreement; and (v) "Third Party Claim"
means any claim, action, suit, or proceeding made or brought by any Person
that is not a party to this Agreement and not an Affiliate of such party to
this Agreement. Section 10.05. Procedures for Third Party Claims. (a) If any
Indemnitee receives notice of assertion or commencement of any Third Party
Claim against such Indemnitee in respect of which an Indemnitor may be
obligated to provide indemnification under this Agreement, the Indemnitee
shall give such Indemnitor reasonably prompt written notice (but in no event
later than 30 days after becoming aware of such Third Party Claim) thereof
and such notice shall include a reasonable description of the claim based on
the facts known at the time and any documents relating to the claim and an
estimate of the Indemnifiable Loss and shall reference the specific sections
of this Agreement that form the basis of such claim to the extent reasonably
ascertainable; provided, that no delay on the part of the Indemnitee in
notifying any Indemnitor shall relieve the Indemnitor from any obligation
hereunder unless (and then solely to the extent that) the Indemnitor is
actually prejudiced by such delay (except that the Indemnitor shall not be
liable for any expenses incurred during the period in which the Indemnitee
failed to give such notice). Thereafter, the Indemnitee  

  

 ![](exhibit21089.jpg) 

84 shall deliver to the Indemnitor, within five Business Days after the
Indemnitee's receipt thereof, copies of all notices and documents (including
court papers) received by the Indemnitee relating to the Third Party Claim.
(b) The Indemnitor shall be entitled to participate in the defense of any
Third Party Claim and, if it so chooses, to assume the defense thereof with
counsel selected by the Indemnitor. Should the Indemnitor so elect to assume
the defense of a Third Party Claim, the Indemnitor shall not as long as it
conducts such defense be liable to the Indemnitee for legal expenses incurred
by the Indemnitee in connection with the defense thereof subsequent to the
Indemnitor notifying the Indemnitee in writing of its election to assume such
defense. If the Indemnitor assumes such defense, the Indemnitee shall have
the right to participate in the defense thereof and to employ counsel, at its
own expense, separate from the counsel employed by the Indemnitor, it being
understood that the Indemnitor shall control such defense. The Indemnitor
shall be liable for the reasonable fees and expenses of counsel employed by
the Indemnitee (A) for any period during which the Indemnitor has not assumed
the defense thereof (other than during any period in which the Indemnitee
shall have not yet given notice of the Third Party Claim as provided above)
or (B) if the Third Party Claim involves conflicts of interest for the
Indemnitee and the Indemnitor (in the reasonable opinion of counsel to the
Indemnitee) that would make representation by the same counsel inappropriate,
in which event the Indemnitor shall be responsible for only one counsel for
the Indemnitee. If the Indemnitor chooses to defend any Third Party Claim,
the other party hereto shall cooperate in the defense thereof. Such
cooperation shall include the retention and (upon the Indemnitor's request)
the provision to the Indemnitor of records and information that are relevant
to such Third Party Claim, and making employees available on a mutually
convenient basis to provide additional information and explanation of any
material provided hereunder; provided, in each case, that such other party
shall not be obligated to provide such records, information or access to
Indemnitor if doing so would violate Applicable Law or jeopardize the
protection of an attorney- client privilege. Whether or not the Indemnitor
shall have assumed the defense of a Third Party Claim, the Indemnitee shall
not admit any liability with respect to, or pay, settle, compromise or
discharge, such Third Party Claim without the Indemnitor's prior written
consent (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or
delayed). If the Indemnitor has assumed the defense of a Third Party Claim,
the Indemnitor may only pay, settle, compromise or discharge a Third Party
Claim with the Indemnitee's prior written consent (which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed); provided, that the Indemnitor
may pay, settle, compromise or discharge such a Third Party Claim without the
written consent of the Indemnitee if such settlement (i) includes a release
of the Indemnitee from all Liability in respect of such Third Party Claim,
(ii) does not subject the Indemnitee to any injunctive relief or other
equitable remedy, (iii) does not include a statement or admission of fault,
culpability or failure to act by or on behalf of the Indemnitee and (iv) does
not impose any financial cost on the Indemnitee (other than by application of
the limitations set forth in Section 10.03(a)). If the Indemnitor submits to
the Indemnitee a bona fide settlement offer with respect to a Third Party
Claim that has been accepted by all Persons bringing such Third Party Claim
and otherwise satisfies the requirements set forth in the proviso of the
immediately preceding sentence and the Indemnitee refuses to consent to such
settlement, then thereafter the Indemnitor's liability to the Indemnitee with
respect to such Third Party Claim shall not exceed the Indemnitor's portion of
the settlement amount included in such settlement offer.  

  

 ![](exhibit21090.jpg) 

85 (c) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, Seller
shall have the sole right to represent the interests of the Business and
settle all issues in its sole discretion, and to employ counsel of its choice
at its expense, in any audit or other examination or administrative or court
proceeding relating to Taxes for all taxable periods (or portions thereof)
ending on or before the Closing Date; provided, that Seller shall not pay,
discharge, settle, compromise, litigate or otherwise dispose of any item
subject to such Tax proceedings in a manner that will adversely affect
Purchaser or any of its Affiliates without obtaining the prior written consent
of Purchaser, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned
or delayed. Notwithstanding the foregoing and subject to Seller's rights set
forth in the immediately preceding sentence, Purchaser shall be entitled, at
its expense, to participate in the conduct of any Tax audit and any judicial
or administrative proceeding relating to any such Tax audit that may
adversely affect Purchaser or any of its Affiliates. Section 10.06. Direct
Claims. The Indemnitor will have a period of 30 days within which to respond
in writing to any claim by an Indemnitee on account of an Indemnifiable Loss
that does not result from a Third Party Claim. If the Indemnitor does not so
respond within such 30 day period, the Indemnitor will be deemed to have
rejected such claim, in which event the Indemnitee will be entitled to pursue
such remedies as may be available to the Indemnitee. Section 10.07. Sole
Remedy. The parties hereto acknowledge and agree that, except as (a) set
forth in Section 11.14, (b) as expressly contemplated by Section 2.09, (c) for
any remedy expressly contemplated by any other Transaction Agreement with
respect to a claim made under such Transaction Agreement and (d) under the
circumstances described in Section 9.03(y), if the Closing occurs, their sole
and exclusive remedy following the Closing with respect to any and all claims
arising out of or related to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
shall be pursuant to the provisions set forth in this Article X. Section
10.08. Certain Other Matters. (a) Upon making any Indemnity Payment,
Indemnitor will, to the extent of such Indemnity Payment, be subrogated to
all rights of Indemnitee against any third Person (other than any Tax
Authority) in respect of the Indemnifiable Loss to which the Indemnity Payment
related. Without limiting the generality or effect of any other provision
hereof, each such Indemnitee and Indemnitor will duly execute upon request
all instruments reasonably necessary to evidence and perfect the above-
described subrogation rights. (b) The rights and remedies of any party in
respect of any inaccuracy or breach of any representation, warranty, covenant
or agreement shall in no way be limited by the fact that the act, omission,
occurrence or other state of facts or circumstances upon which any claim of
any such inaccuracy or breach is based may also be the subject matter of any
other representation, warranty, covenant or agreement as to which there is no
inaccuracy or breach. The representations, warranties and covenants of Seller
set forth herein (as such representations and warranties are qualified in
accordance with the introductory paragraph of Article III), and the Purchaser
Indemnified Persons' rights to indemnification with respect thereto, shall not
be affected or deemed waived by reason of (and the Purchaser Indemnified
Persons shall be deemed to have relied upon such representations and
warranties notwithstanding) (i) any investigation made by or on behalf of any
of the Purchaser Indemnified Persons (including by any of its  

  

 ![](exhibit21091.jpg) 

86 Representatives) or by reason of the fact that any of the Purchaser
Indemnified Persons or any of such Representatives knew or should have known
that any such representation or warranty is, was or might be inaccurate,
regardless of whether such investigation was made or such knowledge was
obtained before or after the execution and delivery of this Agreement or (ii)
Purchaser's waiver of any condition set forth in Article VIII. The
representations, warranties and covenants of Purchaser set forth herein (as
such representations and warranties are qualified in accordance with the
introductory paragraph of Article IV), and the Seller Indemnified Persons'
rights to indemnification with respect thereto, shall not be affected or
deemed waived by reason of (and the Seller Indemnified Persons shall be
deemed to have relied upon such representations and warranties
notwithstanding) (i) any investigation made by or on behalf of any of the
Seller Indemnified Persons (including by any of its Representatives) or by
reason of the fact that any of the Seller Indemnified Persons or any of such
Representatives knew or should have known that any such representation or
warranty is, was or might be inaccurate, regardless of whether such
investigation was made or such knowledge was obtained before or after the
execution and delivery of this Agreement or (ii) Seller's waiver of any
condition set forth in Article VIII. ARTICLE XI. GENERAL PROVISIONS
Section 11.01. Publicity. Except as may otherwise be required by Applicable
Law, regulation or obligation pursuant to any listing agreement with any
national securities exchange, no press release or public announcement,
including any presentation to the investment community (other than pro forma
financial statements and dilution or accretion analyses included in
shareholder presentations), concerning this Agreement or the transactions
contemplated hereby shall be made by Seller, on the one hand, or Purchaser,
on the other hand, prior to the Closing Date without advance approval thereof
by the other party, such approval not to be unreasonably withheld. The
parties hereto shall cooperate with each other in making any press release or
public announcement concerning the Business on or prior to the Closing Date.
Section 11.02. Expenses. Regardless of whether any or all of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement are consummated, and except as otherwise
expressly provided herein or in any Transaction Agreement, Purchaser and its
Affiliates, on the one hand, and Seller and its Affiliates, on the other
hand, shall each bear their respective direct and indirect fees, costs and
expenses incurred in connection with the negotiation and preparation of this
Agreement, the Transaction Agreements and the consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby or thereby, including all fees and expenses
of their respective Representatives. Section 11.03. Notices. All notices,
requests, consents, claims, demands and other communications under this
Agreement and the other Transaction Agreements shall be in writing and shall
be given or made (and shall be deemed to have been duly given or made upon
receipt) by delivery in person, by overnight courier service, by electronic
mail (followed by delivery of an original via overnight courier service) or

88 Section 11.04. Entire Agreement. Except as otherwise expressly provided in
the Transaction Agreements, this Agreement and the other Transaction
Agreements constitute the entire agreement of the parties hereto with respect
to the subject matter of the Transaction Agreements and supersede all prior
agreements and undertakings, both written and oral, other than the
Confidentiality Agreement to the extent not in conflict with this Agreement,
between or on behalf of Seller and its Affiliates, on the one hand, and
Purchaser and its Affiliates, on the other hand, with respect to the subject
matter of the Transaction Agreements. Section 11.05. Severability. If any
term or other provision of this Agreement is invalid, illegal or incapable of
being enforced under any Applicable Law or as a matter of public policy, all
other conditions and provisions of this Agreement shall nevertheless remain in
full force and effect so long as the economic or legal substance of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement is not affected in any manner
materially adverse to any party hereto. Upon such determination that any term
or other provision is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced, the
parties hereto shall negotiate in good faith to modify this Agreement so as to
effect the original intent of the parties hereto as closely as possible in a
mutually acceptable manner in order that the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement be consummated as originally contemplated to the greatest
extent possible. If any provision of this Agreement is determined by a court
of competent jurisdiction to be so broad as to be unenforceable, that
provision shall be interpreted to be only so broad as it is enforceable.
Section 11.06. Assignment. This Agreement may not be assigned, in whole or in
part, by operation of law or otherwise without the prior written consent of
the parties hereto. Any attempted assignment in violation of this Section
11.06 shall be void. This Agreement shall be binding upon, shall inure to the
benefit of, and shall be enforceable by the parties hereto and their
successors and permitted assigns. Section 11.07. Waivers and Amendments. No
provision of this Agreement or any other Transaction Agreements may be
amended, supplemented or modified except by a written instrument signed by
all of the parties thereto. No provision of this Agreement or any other
Transaction Agreements may be waived except by a written instrument signed by
the party against whom the waiver is to be effective. Section 11.08.
Disclosure Schedules. Matters reflected in any Section of this Agreement,
including any section or subsection of the Seller Disclosure Schedule or
Purchaser Disclosure Schedule, are not necessarily limited to matters
required by this Agreement to be so reflected. Such additional matters are
set forth for informational purposes and do not necessarily include other
matters of a similar nature. No reference to or disclosure of any item or
other matter in any Section or Schedule of this Agreement, including any
section or subsection of the Seller Disclosure Schedule or Purchaser
Disclosure Schedule, shall be construed as an admission or indication that
such item or other matter is material or that such item or other matter is
required to be referred to or disclosed in this Agreement, the Seller
Disclosure Schedule or Purchaser Disclosure Schedule. Without limiting the
foregoing, no such reference to or disclosure of a possible breach or
violation of any contract, Applicable Law or Governmental Order shall be
construed as an admission or indication that breach or violation exists or has
actually occurred.

89 Section 11.09. Governing Law; Submission to Jurisdiction; Waiver of Jury
Trial. (a) THIS AGREEMENT SHALL BE GOVERNED BY AND CONSTRUED IN ACCORDANCE
WITH THE LAWS OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK WITHOUT REGARD TO SUCH STATE'S

unconditionally submits to the exclusive jurisdiction of any federal court
located in New York County in the State of New York, over any action, suit or
proceeding arising out of or relating to this Agreement or the transactions
contemplated hereby; provided, however, that, if said court determines that it
does not have subject matter jurisdiction, then said action, suit or
proceeding may be brought in the Supreme Court of the State of New York for
New York County. Each party hereto agrees that service of any process,
summons, notice or document by U.S. registered mail addressed to such party
shall be effective service of process for any action, suit or proceeding
brought against such party in any such court. Purchaser hereby designates the
individual listed in Section 11.03(a) to whom notice may be given on behalf
of Purchaser as its true and lawful agent upon whom may be served any lawful
process in any action, suit or proceeding instituted by or on behalf of
Seller. Seller hereby designates the individual listed in Section 11.03(b) to
whom notice may be given on behalf of Seller as its true and lawful agent
upon whom may be served any lawful process in any action, suit or proceeding
instituted by or on behalf of Purchaser. In the event either party decides to
change its designation of agent, it shall provide written notice to the other
party. Each party hereto irrevocably and unconditionally waives any objection
to the laying of venue of any such action, suit or proceeding brought in any
such court and any claim that any such action, suit or proceeding brought in
any such court has been brought in an inconvenient forum. Each party hereto
agrees that any final, nonappealable judgment in any such action, suit or
proceeding brought in any such court shall be conclusive and binding upon
such party and may be enforced in any other courts to whose jurisdiction such
party may be subject, by suit upon such judgment. (c) EACH OF THE PARTIES
HERETO HEREBY WAIVES TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW ANY RIGHT IT MAY
HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY WITH RESPECT TO ANY LITIGATION DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY
ARISING OUT OF, UNDER OR IN CONNECTION WITH THIS AGREEMENT OR THE
TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED BY THIS AGREEMENT. EACH OF THE PARTIES HERETO
HEREBY (A) CERTIFIES THAT NO REPRESENTATIVE, AGENT OR ATTORNEY OF THE OTHER
PARTY HAS REPRESENTED, EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE, THAT SUCH OTHER PARTY WOULD
NOT, IN THE EVENT OF LITIGATION, SEEK TO ENFORCE THE FOREGOING WAIVER, AND
(B) ACKNOWLEDGES THAT IT HAS BEEN INDUCED TO ENTER INTO THIS AGREEMENT AND
THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED BY THIS AGREEMENT, AS APPLICABLE, BY, AMONG
OTHER THINGS, THE MUTUAL WAIVERS AND CERTIFICATIONS IN THIS SECTION 11.09.

(a) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, the
other Transaction Agreements, the Seller Disclosure Schedule or any of the
Schedules or Exhibits hereto or thereto, Purchaser acknowledges and agrees
that neither Seller nor any of its Representative makes or has made, and
Purchaser has not relied on, any inducement or promise to Purchaser except as
specifically made in this Agreement or any representation or warranty to
Purchaser, oral or written, express or implied, other than as expressly set
forth in Article III. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, other
than as expressly set forth in Article III, no Person has made any
representation or warranty to Purchaser with respect to the Business, the
Transferred Assets (including the Assigned Contracts), the Assumed Liabilities
or any other matter, including with respect to (i) merchantability,
suitability or fitness for any particular purpose, (ii) the operation of the
Business by Purchaser after the Closing, (iii) the probable success or
profitability of the Business after the Closing or (iv) any information,
documents or material made available to Purchaser or its Representatives in
any "data rooms," information memoranda, management presentations, functional
"break-out" discussions or in any other form or forum in connection with the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including any estimation,
valuation, appraisal, projection or forecast with respect to the Business.
With respect to any such estimation, valuation, appraisal, projection or
forecast (including the confidential information memoranda prepared by or on
behalf of Seller in connection with the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement or the any actuarial reports provided to Purchaser), Purchaser
acknowledges that: (i) there are uncertainties inherent in attempting to make
such estimations, valuations, appraisals, projections and forecasts; (ii) it
is familiar with such uncertainties; (iii) it is not acting and has not acted
in reliance on any such estimation valuation, appraisal, projection  

  

 ![](exhibit21096.jpg) 

91 or forecast delivered by or on behalf of Seller to Purchaser; (iv) such
estimations, valuations, appraisals, projections and forecasts are not and
shall not be deemed to be representations or warranties of Seller or any of
its Affiliates and (v) it shall have no claim against any Person with respect
to any such valuation, appraisal, projection or forecast. (b) Seller makes no
express or implied representation or warranty hereby or otherwise under this
Agreement: (i) as to the future experience, success or profitability of the
Business, whether or not conducted in a manner similar to the manner in which
the Business was conducted prior to the Closing; (ii) that the reserves held
by or on behalf of the Business or the assets supporting such reserves have
been or will be adequate or sufficient for the purposes for which they were
established; (iii) that the reinsurance recoverables taken into account in
determining the amount of such reserves will be collectible or whether such
reserves were calculated, established or determined in accordance with any
actuarial, statutory or other standard; or (iv) concerning any financial
statement "line item" or asset, liability or equity amount that would be
affected by any of the foregoing. (c) Purchaser further acknowledges and
agrees that it: (i) has made its own inquiry and investigation into and,
based thereon, has formed an independent judgment concerning the Business,
the Transferred Assets (including the Assigned Contracts) and the Assumed
Liabilities; (ii) has been provided adequate access to such information as it
has deemed necessary to enable it to form such independent judgment; (iii)
has had such time as it deems necessary and appropriate fully and completely
to review and analyze such information, documents and other materials; and
(iv) has been provided an opportunity to ask questions of Seller with respect
to such information, documents and other materials and has received answers
to such questions that it considers satisfactory. Purchaser further
acknowledges and agrees that neither Seller nor any of its Affiliates has
made any representations or warranties, express or implied, as to the
accuracy or completeness of, and that Purchaser and its Affiliates have made
their investment decision with respect to the acquisition of the Transferred
Assets without reliance upon, such information, documents and other materials
other than the representations and warranties expressly set forth in this
Agreement. Section 11.12. No Third Party Beneficiaries. Nothing in this
Agreement is intended or shall be construed to give any Person (including the
employees of Seller or Purchaser or any Affiliate of Seller or Purchaser),
other than the parties hereto, their successors and permitted assigns, any
legal or equitable right, remedy or claim under or in respect of this
Agreement or any provision contained herein. Section 11.13. Execution in
Counterparts. This Agreement may be executed by the parties hereto in
separate counterparts, each of which when so executed and delivered shall be
an original, but all such counterparts shall together constitute one and the
same instrument. Delivery of an executed counterpart of a signature page to
any Transaction Agreement by facsimile or other means of electronic
transmission utilizing reasonable image scan technology shall be as effective
as delivery of a manually executed counterpart of any such Agreement. Section
11.14. Equitable Remedies. The parties hereto agree that irreparable damage
would occur in the event that any of the provisions of this Agreement were not
performed in accordance with their specific terms or were otherwise breached.
It is accordingly agreed that,  

  

 ![](exhibit21097.jpg) 

92 without the necessity of posting bond or other undertaking, the parties
hereto shall be entitled to an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches
of this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions of
this Agreement in accordance with this Agreement, this being in addition
(subject to the terms of this Agreement) to any other remedy to which such
party is entitled at law or in equity. In the event that any Action is
brought in equity to enforce the provisions of this Agreement, no party
hereto shall allege, and each party hereto hereby waives any defense or
counterclaim, that there is an adequate remedy at law. If, prior to the
Outside Date, any party hereto brings any Action in accordance with this
Section 11.14 to enforce specifically the performance of the terms and
provisions hereof by the other party, the Outside Date shall be automatically
extended (i) for the period during which such action is pending, plus 10
Business Days or (ii) by such other time period established by the court
presiding over such action, as the case may be. (The remainder of this page
