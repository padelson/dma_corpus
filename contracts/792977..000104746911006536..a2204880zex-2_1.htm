_ AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER AND REORGANIZATION 

  

 THIS AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER AND REORGANIZATION ("Agreement") is made and entered into as of July 19, 2011, by and among AMAG PHARMACEUTICALS, INC., a Delaware corporation ("Parent"); ALAMO ACQUISITION SUB, INC., a Delaware corporation and a wholly-owned subsidiary of Parent ("Merger Sub"); and ALLOS THERAPEUTICS, INC., a Delaware corporation (the "Company"). Certain capitalized terms used in this Agreement are defined in _Exhibit A_. 

  

    
RECITALS 

  

 A. Parent, Merger Sub and the Company intend to engage in a strategic business combination to advance their long-term strategies to be effected by a merger of Merger Sub into the Company in accordance with this Agreement and the DGCL (the "Merger"). Upon consummation of the Merger, Merger Sub will cease to exist, and the Company will become a wholly-owned subsidiary of Parent. 

  

 B. It is intended that the Merger qualify as a "reorganization" within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code and that this Agreement qualifies as a "plan of reorganization" within the meaning of Sections 1.368-2(g) and 1.368-3(a) of the United States Treasury Regulations. 

  

 C. The respective boards of directors of Parent, Merger Sub and the Company have approved this Agreement and the Merger. 

  

 D. In order to induce Parent to enter into this Agreement and cause the Merger to be consummated, certain stockholders of the Company are executing voting agreements in favor of Parent concurrently with the execution of this Agreement (the "Company Stockholder Voting Agreements"). 

  

 E. In order to induce the Company to enter into this Agreement and consummate the Merger, certain stockholders of Parent are executing voting agreements in favor of the Company concurrently with the execution of this Agreement (the "Parent Stockholder Voting Agreements"). 

  

    
AGREEMENT 

  

 The parties to this Agreement, intending to be legally bound, agree as follows: 

  

  

Section 1\. DESCRIPTION OF TRANSACTION

  

  

 1.1 Merger of Merger Sub into the Company. Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement, at the Effective Time, Merger Sub shall be merged with and into the Company. By virtue of the Merger, at the Effective Time, the separate existence of Merger Sub shall cease and the Company shall continue as the surviving corporation in the Merger (the "Surviving Corporation"). 

  

 1.2 Effects of the Merger. The Merger shall have the effects set forth in this Agreement and in the applicable provisions of the DGCL. 

  

 1.3 Closing; Effective Time. The consummation of the Merger (the "Closing") shall take place at the offices of Cooley LLP, 500 Boylston Street, Boston, Massachusetts, on a date to be designated jointly by Parent and the Company, which shall be no later than the second business day after the satisfaction or waiver of the last to be satisfied or waived of the conditions set forth in Sections 6 and 7 (other than the conditions, which by their nature are to be satisfied at the Closing, but subject to the satisfaction or waiver of each of such conditions). The date on which the Closing actually takes place is referred to as the "Closing Date." Subject to the provisions of this Agreement, a certificate of merger satisfying the applicable requirements of the DGCL shall be duly executed by the Company and concurrently with or as soon as practicable following the Closing shall be filed with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware. The Merger shall become effective at the time of the filing of such certificate of merger with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware or at such later time as may      
  

be designated jointly by Parent and the Company and specified in such
certificate of merger (the time as of which the Merger becomes effective being
referred to as the "Effective Time").

  

 1.4 Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws; Directors and Officers. 

  

 (a) The Certificate of Incorporation of the Surviving Corporation shall be amended and restated immediately after the Effective Time to read as set forth on _Exhibit B_; 

  

 (b) The Bylaws of the Surviving Corporation shall be amended and restated immediately after the Effective Time to conform to read as set forth on _Exhibit C_; and 

   

 (c) The directors and officers of the Surviving Corporation immediately after the Effective Time shall be as mutually agreed between the Company and Parent prior to the Effective Time. 

  

 1.5 Conversion of Shares. 

  

 (a) Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, at the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any further action on the part of Parent, Merger Sub, the Company or any stockholder of the Company: 

  

  

 (i) any shares of Company Common Stock owned by any wholly-owned Subsidiary of the Company immediately prior to the Effective Time (or held in the Company\'s treasury) shall be canceled and retired and shall cease to exist, and no consideration shall be delivered in exchange therefor; 

  

 (ii) any shares of Company Common Stock owned by Parent, Merger Sub or any other wholly-owned Subsidiary of Parent immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be canceled and retired and shall cease to exist, and no consideration shall be delivered in exchange therefor; 

   

 (iii) except as provided in clauses "(i)" and "(ii)" above and subject to Sections 1.5(c) and 1.5(d), each share of Company Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be converted into the right to receive 0.1282 of a share of Parent Common Stock (such number as may be adjusted in accordance with Section 1.5(b), the "Exchange Ratio"); and 

  

 (iv) each share of the Common Stock, $.001 par value per share, of Merger Sub outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be converted into one share of common stock of the Surviving Corporation. 

  

  

 (b) If, during the period from the date of this Agreement through the Effective Time, the outstanding shares of Company Common Stock or Parent Common Stock are changed into a different number or class of shares by reason of any stock split, division or subdivision of shares, stock dividend, reverse stock split, combination of shares, reclassification, recapitalization or other similar transaction, or if a stock dividend is declared by the Company or Parent during such period, then the Exchange Ratio shall be adjusted to the extent appropriate to provide the same economic effect as contemplated by this Agreement prior to such action. 

   

 (c) If any shares of Company Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time are unvested or are subject to a repurchase option, risk of forfeiture or other condition under any applicable restricted stock purchase agreement or other Contract with the Company or under which the Company has any rights, then (except to the extent provided in any binding agreement between the Company and the holder thereof): (i) the shares of Parent Common Stock issued in exchange for such shares of Company Common Stock will also be unvested and subject to the same repurchase option, risk of forfeiture or other condition; and (ii) the certificates representing such shares of Parent Common Stock may accordingly be marked with appropriate legends. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall use commercially reasonable efforts to ensure that, from and after the Effective Time, Parent or the Surviving Corporation is entitled to exercise any such repurchase option or other right set forth in any such restricted stock purchase agreement or other Contract. 

        

 (d) No fractional shares of Parent Common Stock shall be issued in connection with the Merger, and no certificates or scrip for any such fractional shares shall be issued. Any holder of Company Common Stock who would otherwise be entitled to receive a fraction of a share of Parent Common Stock (after aggregating all fractional shares of Parent Common Stock issuable to such holder) shall, in lieu of such fraction of a share and upon surrender of such holder\'s Company Stock Certificate(s), or non-certificated shares of Company Common Stock represented by book entry ("Book Entry Shares"), be paid in cash the dollar amount (rounded to the nearest whole cent), without interest, determined by multiplying such fraction by the closing price of a share of Parent Common Stock on the NASDAQ Global Select Market on the last business day prior to the date on which the Merger becomes effective. 

  

 1.6 Closing of the Company\'s Transfer Books. At the Effective Time: (a) all shares of Company Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall automatically be canceled and retired and shall cease to exist, and all holders of Book Entry Shares or of certificates representing shares of Company Common Stock that were outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall cease to have any rights as stockholders of the Company, except the right to receive shares of Parent Common Stock as contemplated by Section 1.5, cash in lieu of any fractional share of Parent Common Stock pursuant to Section 1.5(d) and any dividends or other distributions pursuant to Section 1.7(c); and (b) the stock transfer books of the Company shall be closed with respect to all shares of Company Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time. No further transfer of any such shares of Company Common Stock shall be made on such stock transfer books after the Effective Time. If, after the Effective Time, a valid certificate previously representing any shares of Company Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (a "Company Stock Certificate") or a Book Entry Share is presented to the Exchange Agent or to the Surviving Corporation or Parent, such Company Stock Certificate or Book Entry Share shall be canceled and shall be exchanged as provided in Section 1.7. 

  

 1.7 Exchange of Certificates. 

  

 (a) Prior to the Closing Date, Parent shall select a reputable bank or trust company reasonably satisfactory to the Company to act as exchange agent in the Merger (the "Exchange Agent"). Prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall issue and cause to be deposited with the Exchange Agent: (i) non-certificated shares of Parent Common Stock represented by book entry issuable pursuant to Section 1.5; and (ii) cash sufficient to make payments in lieu of fractional shares in accordance with Section 1.5(d). The shares of Parent Common Stock and cash amounts so deposited with the Exchange Agent, together with any dividends or distributions received by the Exchange Agent with respect to such shares of Parent Common Stock, are referred to collectively as the "Exchange Fund." 

  

 (b) Promptly after the Effective Time, the Exchange Agent will mail to the Persons who were record holders of Company Stock Certificates or Book Entry Shares immediately prior to the Effective Time: (i) a letter of transmittal in customary form and containing such provisions as Parent may reasonably specify and the Company shall reasonably approve prior to the Effective Time (including a provision confirming that delivery of Company Stock Certificates or Book Entry Shares shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to Company Stock Certificates or Book Entry Shares shall pass, only upon delivery of such Company Stock Certificates or Book Entry Shares to the Exchange Agent); and (ii) instructions for use in effecting the surrender of Company Stock Certificates or Book Entry Shares in exchange for non-certificated shares of Parent Common Stock in book entry form. Upon surrender of a Company Stock Certificate or Book Entry Shares to the Exchange Agent for exchange, together with a duly executed letter of transmittal and such other documents as may be reasonably required by the Exchange Agent or Parent: (A) the holder of such Company Stock Certificate or Book Entry Shares shall be entitled to receive, and the Exchange Agent shall (and Parent shall cause the Exchange Agent to) in exchange therefor transfer from the Exchange Fund to such holder the number of whole shares of Parent Common Stock that such holder has the right to receive pursuant to the provisions of Section 1.5 (and cash in lieu of any fractional share of Parent Common Stock pursuant to 

        

Section 1.5(d) and any dividends or other distributions pursuant to Section
1.7(c)); and (B) the Company Stock Certificate or Book Entry Shares so
surrendered shall be canceled. Until surrendered as contemplated by this
Section 1.7(b), each Company Stock Certificate and Book Entry Share shall be
deemed, from and after the Effective Time, to represent only the right
to receive shares of Parent Common Stock (and cash in lieu of any fractional
share of Parent Common Stock) as contemplated by Section 1.5 and any dividends
or other distributions pursuant to Section 1.7(c). If any Company Stock
Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, Parent may, in its
discretion and as a condition to the issuance of any non-certificated shares
of Parent Common Stock in book entry form, require the owner of such lost,
stolen or destroyed Company Stock Certificate to post a bond, in such
reasonable and customary amount as Parent may direct, as indemnity against
any claim that may be made against Exchange Agent, Parent or the Surviving
Corporation with respect to such Company Stock Certificate.

  

 (c) No dividends or other distributions declared or made with respect to Parent Common Stock with a record date after the Effective Time shall be paid or otherwise delivered to the holder of any unsurrendered Company Stock Certificate or Book Entry Share with respect to the shares of Parent Common Stock that such holder has the right to receive in the Merger until such holder surrenders such Company Stock Certificate or Book Entry Share in accordance with this Section 1.7 (at which time such holder shall be entitled, subject to the effect of applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar laws, to receive all such dividends and distributions, without interest). 

  

 (d) Any portion of the Exchange Fund that remains undistributed to holders of Company Stock Certificates and Book Entry Shares as of the date that is one year after the date on which the Merger becomes effective shall be delivered to Parent upon demand, and any holders of Company Stock Certificates or Book Entry Shares who have not theretofore surrendered their Company Stock Certificates or Book Entry Shares in accordance with this Section 1.7 shall thereafter look only to Parent for satisfaction of their claims for Parent Common Stock, cash in lieu of fractional shares of Parent Common Stock and any dividends or distributions with respect to shares of Parent Common Stock.

maintained, established, sponsored, participated in or contributed to any
Company Pension Plan in which stock of any of the Alamo Corporations or any
Company Affiliate is or was held as a plan asset. The fair market value of
the assets of each funded Foreign Plan, the liability of each insurer for any
Foreign Plan funded through insurance, or the book reserve established for any
Foreign Plan, together with any accrued contributions, is sufficient to
procure or provide in full for the accrued benefit obligations, with respect
to all current and former participants in such Foreign Plan according to the
reasonable actuarial assumptions and valuations most recently used to
determine employer contributions to and obligations under such Foreign Plan,
and no Contemplated Transaction will cause any such assets or insurance
obligations to be less than such benefit obligations. There are no
material liabilities of the Alamo Corporations with respect to any Company
Employee Plan that are not properly accrued and reflected in the financial

No "prohibited transaction," within the meaning of Section 4975 of the Code or Sections 406 and 407 of ERISA, and not otherwise exempt under Section 408 of ERISA, has occurred with respect to any Parent Employee Plan.

Each of the Abeline Corporations and Parent Affiliates has made all contributions and other payments required by and due under the terms of each Parent Employee Plan and each Parent Employee Agreement.

None of the Abeline Corporations, and no Parent Affiliate, has ever maintained, established, sponsored, participated in or contributed to any Parent Pension Plan in which stock of any of the Abeline Corporations or any Parent Affiliate is or was held as a plan asset. The fair market value of 

        
  

the assets of each funded Foreign Plan, the liability of each insurer for any
Foreign Plan funded through insurance, or the book reserve established for any
Foreign Plan, together with any accrued contributions, is sufficient to
procure or provide in full for the accrued benefit obligations, with respect
to all current and former participants in such Foreign Plan according to the
reasonable actuarial assumptions and valuations most recently used to
determine employer contributions to and obligations under such Foreign Plan,
and no Contemplated Transaction will cause any such assets or insurance
obligations to be less than such benefit obligations. There are no material
liabilities of the Abeline Corporations with respect to any Parent Employee
Plan that are not properly accrued and reflected in the financial statements
of the Parent in accordance with GAAP.

Other than commitments made that involve no future costs to any of the Abeline Corporations or any Parent Affiliate, none of the Abeline Corporations nor any Parent Affiliate has ever represented, promised or contracted (whether in oral or written form) to any Parent Associate (either individually or to Parent Associates as a group) or any other Person that such Parent Associate(s) or other Person would be provided with post-termination or retiree life insurance, post-termination or retiree health benefit or other post-termination or retiree employee welfare benefits, except to the extent required by applicable Legal Requirements.

 (i) Except as set forth in Part 3.16(i) of the Parent Disclosure Schedule, each of the Abeline Corporations and Parent Affiliates: (i) is, and at all times has been, in compliance in all material respects with any Order or arbitration award of any court, arbitrator or any Governmental Body respecting employment, employment practices, terms and conditions of employment, wages, hours or other labor related matters; (ii) has withheld and reported all amounts required by applicable Legal Requirements or by Contract to be withheld and reported with respect to wages, salaries and other payments to Parent Associates; (iii) is not, to the knowledge of the Parent, liable for any arrears of wages or any taxes or any interest or penalty for failure to comply with the Legal Requirements applicable of the foregoing; and (iv) is not liable for any payment to any trust or other fund governed by or maintained by or on behalf of any Governmental Body with respect to unemployment compensation benefits, social security, social charges or other benefits or obligations for Parent Associates (other than routine payments to be made in the normal course of business and consistent with past practice). 

   

 (j) There is no agreement, plan, arrangement or other Contract covering any Parent Associate, and no payments have been made or will be made in connection with the Merger to any Parent Associate, that, considered individually or considered collectively with any other such Contracts or payments, will, or would reasonably be expected to, be characterized as a "parachute payment" within the meaning of Section 280G(b)(2) of the Code or give rise directly or indirectly to the payment of any 

        
  

amount that would not be deductible pursuant to Section 162(m) of the Code
(or any comparable provision under state or foreign Tax laws). No Abeline
Corporation is a party to or has any obligation under any Contract to
compensate any Person for excise taxes payable pursuant to Section 4999 of the
Code or for additional taxes payable pursuant to Section 409A of the Code.

  

 (k) Since January 1, 2009, none of the Abeline Corporations has effectuated a "plant closing," partial "plant closing," "relocation", "mass layoff" or "termination" (as defined in the WARN Act or any similar Legal Requirement) affecting any site of employment or one or more facilities or operating units within any site of employment or facility of any of the Abeline Corporations.

 (i) solicit, initiate, knowingly encourage or knowingly facilitate the making, submission or announcement of any Acquisition Proposal with respect to an Alamo Corporation or Acquisition Inquiry with respect to an Alamo Corporation; 

   

 (ii) knowingly furnish any information regarding any of the Alamo Corporations to any Person in connection with or in response to an Acquisition Proposal with respect to an Alamo Corporation or Acquisition Inquiry with respect to an Alamo Corporation;

 (v) enter into any letter of intent or similar document or any Contract contemplating or otherwise relating to any Acquisition Transaction or Acquisition Inquiry with respect to an Alamo Corporation. 

  

  

 _provided, however,_ that prior to the adoption of this Agreement by the
Required Company Stockholder Vote, this Section 4.4(a) shall not prohibit the
Company from furnishing information regarding the Alamo Corporations to, or
entering into discussions and negotiations with, any Person in response to an
Acquisition Proposal that is reasonably expected to result in a Company
Superior Offer that is

        

submitted to the Company by such Person (and not withdrawn) if: (A) such
Acquisition Proposal did not result from any breach of, or any action
inconsistent with, any of the provisions set forth in this Section 4.4; (B)
the Company Board concludes in good faith, after having consulted with its
outside legal counsel, that failure to take such action would reasonably
constitute a breach of the fiduciary duties of the Company Board to the
Company\'s stockholders under applicable law; (C) at least two business days
prior to furnishing any such information to, or entering into discussions or
negotiations with, such Person, the Company gives Parent written notice of the
identity of such Person and of the Company\'s intention to furnish information
to, or enter into discussions with, such Person, and the Company receives
from such Person an executed confidentiality agreement (which the Company may
discuss with such Person during the two day period) containing provisions
(including nondisclosure provisions, use restrictions and non-solicitation
provisions) at least as favorable to the Company as the provisions of the
Confidentiality Agreement as in effect immediately prior to the execution
of this Agreement (provided, however, that no such confidentiality agreement
need include "standstill" provisions); and (D) at least two business days
prior to furnishing any such information to such Person, the Company
furnishes such information to Parent (to the extent such information has not
been previously furnished or Made Available by the Company to Parent). Parent
and the Company agree that any action inconsistent with the restrictions set
forth in this Section 4.4 by any Alamo Corporation or by any Representative of
an Alamo Corporation will be deemed to be a breach of this Section 4.4 by the
Company.

  

 (b) During the Pre-Closing Period, Parent shall not, directly or indirectly, and Parent shall cause its Subsidiaries and the respective Representatives of the Abeline Corporations not to, directly or indirectly:

 (iv) approve, endorse or recommend any Acquisition Proposal with respect to an Abeline Corporation or Acquisition Inquiry with respect to an Abeline Corporation; or 

  

 (v) enter into any letter of intent or similar document or any Contract contemplating or otherwise relating to any Acquisition Transaction or Acquisition Inquiry with respect to an Abeline Corporation. 

  

  

 _provided, however,_ that prior to the approval of the issuance of shares of
Parent Common Stock in the Merger by the Required Parent Stockholder
Vote, this Section 4.4(b) shall not prohibit Parent from furnishing
information regarding the Abeline Corporations to, or entering into
discussions and negotiations with, any Person in response to an Acquisition
Proposal that is reasonably expected to result in a Company Superior Offer
that is submitted to Parent by such Person (and not withdrawn): (A) such
Acquisition Proposal did not result from any breach of, or any action
inconsistent with, any of the provisions set forth in this Section 4.4; (B)
the Parent Board concludes in good faith, after having consulted with its
outside legal counsel, that failure to take such action would reasonably
constitute a breach of the fiduciary duties of the Parent Board to Parent\'s
stockholders under applicable law; (C) at least two business days prior to
furnishing any such information to, or entering into discussions or
negotiations with, such Person, Parent gives the Company written notice of
the identity of such Person

        

and of Parent\'s intention to furnish information to, or enter into
discussions with, such Person, and Parent receives from such Person an
executed confidentiality agreement (which the Parent may discuss with such
Person during the two day period) containing provisions (including
nondisclosure provisions, use restrictions and non-solicitation provisions) at
least as favorable to Parent as the provisions of the Confidentiality
Agreement as in effect immediately prior to the execution of this Agreement
(provided, however, that no such confidentiality agreement need
include "standstill" provisions); and (D) at least two business days prior to
furnishing any such information to such Person, Parent furnishes such
information to the Company (to the extent such information has not been
previously furnished or Made Available by Parent to the Company). The Company
and Parent agree that any action inconsistent with the restrictions set forth
in this Section 4.4 by any Abeline Corporation or by any Representative of an
Abeline Corporation will be deemed to be a breach of this Section 4.4 by
Parent.

  

 (c) Each of Parent and the Company shall promptly (and in no event later than 24 hours after receipt of any Acquisition Proposal with respect to an Alamo Corporation or an Abeline Corporation, as the case may be, or Acquisition Inquiry with respect to an Alamo Corporation or an Abeline Corporation, as the case may be) advise the other party to this Agreement orally and in writing of any such Acquisition Proposal or Acquisition Inquiry (including the identity of the Person making or submitting such Acquisition Proposal or Acquisition Inquiry and the terms thereof, including a copy of any written Acquisition Proposal or Acquisition Inquiry) that is made or submitted by any Person during the Pre-Closing Period. Each party receiving an Acquisition Proposal or Acquisition Inquiry shall keep the other party reasonably informed with respect to: (i) the status of any such Acquisition Proposal or Acquisition Inquiry, including any negotiations with respect thereto; and (ii) the status and terms of any material modification or proposed material modification thereto. 

  

 (d) Each of Parent and the Company shall, and shall cause their respective Subsidiaries and Representatives to, immediately cease and cause to be terminated any discussions conducted on or before the date of this Agreement with any Person that relate to any Acquisition Proposal or Acquisition Inquiry. 

  

 (e) Each of Parent and the Company agrees not to release or permit the release of any Person from, or to waive or permit the waiver of any provision of, any confidentiality, non-solicitation, no hire, "standstill" or similar Contract to which any such party or any of its Subsidiaries is a party or under which any such party or any of its Subsidiaries has any rights, and will use its reasonable efforts to cause each such agreement to be enforced at the request of the other party to this Agreement, except that each of Parent and the Company may waive any "standstill" or similar contract to which any such party or any subsidiary is a party if the party\'s board of directors concludes in good faith, after having consulted with outside counsel, that the failure to take such action would reasonably constitute a breach of any fiduciary duties of the party\'s board of directors.

The Company in consultation with Parent shall set a record date for persons entitled to notice of, and to vote at, the Company\'s Stockholders\' Meeting and shall not change such record date without the prior written consent of Parent (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed). Subject to the rights to postpone or adjourn the Company Stockholders\' Meeting set forth below, the Company Stockholders\' Meeting shall be held (on a date selected by the Company in consultation with Parent) as promptly as practicable after the Form S-4 Registration Statement is declared effective under the Securities Act. The Company shall ensure that all proxies solicited by the Alamo Corporations and their Representatives in connection with the Company Stockholders\' Meeting are solicited in compliance with all applicable Legal Requirements. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, the Company may after consultation with Parent adjourn or postpone the Company\'s Stockholders\' Meeting only: (A) to the extent necessary to ensure that any supplement or amendment to the Joint Proxy Statement/ 

        
  

Prospectus that is required by applicable Legal Requirement (or in connection
with the settlement of any applicable litigation) is timely provided to the
Company\'s stockholders; (B) if as of the time for which the Company
Stockholders\' Meeting is originally scheduled there are insufficient shares
of Company Common Stock represented (either in person or by proxy) to
constitute a quorum necessary to conduct the business to be conducted at the
Company\'s Stockholders\' Meeting; or (C) if additional time is reasonably
required to solicit proxies in favor of the adoption of this Agreement.

  

 (b) Subject to Section 5.2(c): (i) the Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus shall include a statement to the effect that the Company Board has determined that this Agreement and the Merger are advisable and fair to, and in the best interests of, the Company and its stockholders, and recommends that the Company\'s stockholders vote to adopt this Agreement at the Company Stockholders\' Meeting (such determination and recommendation being referred to as the "Company Board Recommendation"); (ii) the Company Board Recommendation shall not be directly or indirectly withdrawn or modified in a manner adverse to Parent; (iii) neither the Company Board nor any committee thereof shall: (A) fail to publicly reaffirm the Company Board Recommendation, or fail to publicly state that the Merger and this Agreement are in the best interest of the Company\'s stockholders, within five business days after Parent requests in writing that such action be taken; (B) fail to publicly announce, within ten business days after a tender offer or exchange offer relating to the securities of the Company shall have been commenced, a statement disclosing that the Company Board recommends rejection of such tender or exchange offer; (C) fail to issue, within five business days after an Acquisition Proposal with respect to an Alamo Corporation is publicly announced, a press release announcing its opposition to such Acquisition Proposal; or (D) resolve to take any action described in clauses "(ii)" or "(iii)" of this sentence (each of the foregoing actions described in clauses "(ii)" and "(iii)" being referred to as a "Company Change in Recommendation"). 

  

 (c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in Section 5.2(b) or elsewhere in this Agreement, at any time prior to the adoption of this Agreement by the Required Company Stockholder Vote, the Company Board may effect, or cause the Company to effect, as the case may be, a Company Change in Recommendation: 

  

  

 (i) if: (A) the Company has not breached its obligations under Section 4.4 in connection with the offer referred to in the following clause "(B);" (B) after the date of this Agreement, an unsolicited, bona fide, written offer to acquire all of the outstanding shares of Company Common Stock (whether through a tender offer, merger or otherwise) is made to the Company and is not withdrawn; (C) the Company Board determines in its good faith judgment, after consulting with a financial advisor of nationally recognized reputation and outside legal counsel, that such offer constitutes a Company Superior Offer; (D) the Company Board does not effect, or cause the Company to effect, a Company Change in Recommendation at any time within three business days after Parent receives written notice from the Company confirming that the Company Board has determined that such offer is a Company Superior Offer; (E) during such three business day period, if requested by Parent, the Company engages in good faith negotiations with Parent to amend this Agreement in such a manner that the offer that was determined to constitute a Company Superior Offer no longer constitutes a Company Superior Offer; (F) at the end of such three business day period, such offer has not been withdrawn and continues to constitute a Company Superior Offer (taking into account any changes to the terms of this Agreement proposed by Parent as a result of the negotiations required by clause "(E)" or otherwise); and (G) the Company Board determines in good faith, after having consulted with its outside legal counsel, that, in light of such Company Superior Offer, a failure to make a Company Change in Recommendation would reasonably constitute a breach of the fiduciary duties of the Company Board to the Company\'s stockholders under applicable law; or 

  

 (ii) if: (A) other than (1) the development or circumstances contemplated by clause "(i)" of this Section 5.2(c) or (2) in connection with or as a result of the making of, or any development or 

  

      

  
  

circumstance relating to, an Acquisition Proposal with respect to an Alamo
Corporation or an Acquisition Inquiry with respect to an Alamo Corporation, a
material development or change in circumstances occurs or arises after the
date of this Agreement that was neither known to the Company Board nor
reasonably foreseeable to the Company Board as of the date of this Agreement
(such material development or change in circumstances being referred to as a
"Company Intervening Event"); (B) at least three business days prior to any
meeting of the Company Board at which the Company Board will consider whether
such Company Intervening Event requires the Company Board to effect, or cause
the Company to effect, a Company Change in Recommendation, the Company
provides Parent with a written notice specifying the date and time of such
meeting and the reasons for holding such meeting; (C) during such three
business day period, if requested by Parent, the Company engages in good
faith negotiations with Parent to amend this Agreement in such a manner that
obviates the need for the Company Board to effect, or cause the Company to
effect, a Company Change in Recommendation as a result of such Company
Intervening Event; and (D) the Company Board determines in good faith, after
having consulted with its outside legal counsel, that, in light of such
Company Intervening Event, a failure to make a Company Change in
Recommendation would reasonably constitute a breach of the fiduciary duties of
the Company Board to the Company\'s stockholders under applicable law.

  

  

 5.3 Parent Stockholders\' Meeting. 

  

 (a) Parent: (i) shall take all action necessary under all applicable Legal Requirements to call, give notice of and hold a meeting of the holders of Parent Common Stock to vote on a proposal to approve the issuance of shares of Parent Common Stock in the Merger pursuant to Nasdaq Listing Rule 5635 (the "Parent Stockholders\' Meeting"); and (ii) shall submit such proposal to such holders at the Parent Stockholders\' Meeting and shall not submit any other proposal to such holders in connection with the Parent Stockholders\' Meeting without the prior written consent of the Company. Parent in consultation with the Company shall set a record date for persons entitled to notice of, and to vote at, the Parent Stockholders\' Meeting and shall not change such record date without the prior written consent of the Company (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed). Subject to the rights to postpone or adjourn the Parent Stockholders\' Meeting set forth below, the Parent Stockholders\' Meeting shall be held on the same date as the Company Stockholders\' Meeting (unless otherwise agreed upon by the Company and Parent). Parent shall ensure that all proxies solicited by the Abeline Corporations and their Representatives in connection with the Parent Stockholders\' Meeting are solicited in compliance with all applicable Legal Requirements. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, Parent may after consultation with the Company adjourn or postpone the Parent Stockholders\' Meeting only: (i) to the extent necessary to ensure that any supplement or amendment to the Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus that is required by applicable Legal Requirement (or in connection with the settlement of any applicable litigation) is timely provided to Parent\'s stockholders; (ii) if as of the time for which the Parent Stockholders\' Meeting is originally scheduled there are insufficient shares of Parent Common Stock represented (either in person or by proxy) to constitute a quorum necessary to conduct the business to be conducted at the Parent Stockholders\' Meeting; or (iii) if additional time is reasonably required to solicit proxies in favor of the approval of the issuance of shares of Parent Common Stock in the Merger. 

  

 (b) Subject to Section 5.3(c): (i) the Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus shall include a statement to the effect that the Parent Board has determined that this Agreement and the Merger are advisable and fair to, and in the best interests of, Parent and its stockholders, and recommends that Parent\'s stockholders vote to approve the issuance of shares of Parent Common Stock in the Merger at the Parent Stockholders\' Meeting (such determination and recommendation being referred to as the "Parent Board Recommendation"); (ii) the Parent Board Recommendation shall not be directly or indirectly withdrawn or modified in a manner adverse to the Company; (iii) neither the Parent Board nor any committee thereof shall: (A) fail to publicly reaffirm the Parent Board Recommendation, or 

        
  

fail to publicly state that this Agreement and the Merger are in the best
interest of Parent and its stockholders, within five business days after the
Company requests in writing that such action be taken; (B) fail to publicly
announce, within ten business days after a tender offer or exchange offer
relating to the securities of Parent shall have been commenced, a statement
disclosing that the Parent Board recommends rejection of such tender or
exchange offer; (C) fail to issue, within five business days after an
Acquisition Proposal with respect to an Abeline Corporation is publicly
announced, a press release announcing its opposition to such Acquisition
Proposal; or (D) resolve to take any action described in clauses "(ii)" or

"(ii)" and "(iii)" being referred to as a "Parent Change in Recommendation").

   

 (c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in Section 5.3(b) or elsewhere in this Agreement, at any time prior to the approval of the issuance of shares of Parent Common Stock in the Merger by the Required Parent Stockholder Vote, the Parent Board may effect, or cause Parent to effect, as the case may be, a Parent Change in Recommendation: 

  

  

 (i) if: (A) Parent has not breached its obligations under Section 4.4 in connection with the offer referred to in the following clause "(B);" (B) after the date of this Agreement, an unsolicited, bona fide, written offer to acquire all of the outstanding shares of Parent Common Stock (whether through a tender offer, merger or otherwise) is made to Parent and is not withdrawn; (C) the Parent Board determines in its good faith judgment, after consulting with a financial advisor of nationally recognized reputation and outside legal counsel, that such offer constitutes a Parent Superior Offer; (D) the Parent Board does not effect, or cause Parent to effect, a Parent Change in Recommendation at any time within three business days after the Company receives written notice from Parent confirming that the Parent Board has determined that such offer is a Parent Superior Offer; (E) during such three business day period, if requested by the Company, Parent engages in good faith negotiations with the Company to amend this Agreement in such a manner that the offer that was determined to constitute a Parent Superior Offer no longer constitutes a Parent Superior Offer; (F) at the end of such three business day period, such offer has not been withdrawn and continues to constitute a Parent Superior Offer (taking into account any changes to the terms of this Agreement proposed by the Company as a result of the negotiations required by clause "(E)" or otherwise); and (G) the Parent Board determines in good faith, after having consulted with its outside legal counsel, that, in light of such Parent Superior Offer, a failure to make a Parent Change in Recommendation would reasonably constitute a breach of the fiduciary duties of the Parent Board to Parent\'s stockholders under applicable law; or 

  

 (ii) if: (A) other than (1) the development or circumstances contemplated by clause "(i)" of this Section 5.3(c) or (2) in connection with or as a result of the making of, or any development or circumstance relating to, an Acquisition Proposal with respect to an Abeline Corporation or an Acquisition Inquiry with respect to an Abeline Corporation, a material development or change in circumstances occurs or arises after the date of this Agreement that was neither known to the Parent Board nor reasonably foreseeable to the Parent Board as of the date of this Agreement (such material development or change in circumstances being referred to as an "Parent Intervening Event" and, together with a Company Intervening Event, as applicable, an "Intervening Event"); (B) at least three business days prior to any meeting of the Parent Board at which the Parent Board will consider whether such Parent Intervening Event requires the Parent Board to effect, or cause Parent to effect, a Parent Change in Recommendation, Parent provides the Company with a written notice specifying the date and time of such meeting and the reasons for holding such meeting; (C) during such three business day period, if requested by the Company, Parent engages in good faith negotiations with the Company to amend this Agreement in such a manner that obviates the need for the Parent Board to effect, or cause Parent to effect, a Parent Change in Recommendation as a result of such Parent Intervening Event; and (D) the Parent 

  

      

  
  

Board determines in good faith, after having consulted with its outside legal
counsel, that, in light of such Parent Intervening Event, a failure to make a
Parent Change in Recommendation would reasonably constitute a breach of the
fiduciary duties of the Parent Board to Parent\'s stockholders under
applicable law.

  

  

 5.4 Stock Options and Company ESPP. 

  

 (a) At the Effective Time, (x) each Company Option that is outstanding and unexercised immediately prior to the Effective Time, whether or not vested, shall be converted into and become an option to purchase Parent Common Stock, and Parent shall assume such Company Option in accordance with the terms (as in effect as of the date of this Agreement) of the applicable Company Option Plan and the terms of the stock option agreement by which such Company Option is evidenced; (y) each award of Company RSUs outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be converted at the Effective Time into an award of Parent RSUs on the same terms and conditions as were applicable under such award of Company RSUs with respect to a number of shares of Parent Common Stock (rounded down to the nearest whole share) determined by multiplying the number of shares of Company Common Stock subject to such award immediately prior to the Effective Time by the Exchange Ratio; and (z) each share of Parent Common Stock into which a share of Company Restricted Stock was converted pursuant to Section 1.5 shall be a share of Parent Restricted Stock and shall remain subject to the same terms and conditions as were applicable under the award of Company Restricted Stock immediately prior to the Effective Time. All rights with respect to Company Common Stock under Company Options assumed by Parent shall thereupon be converted into options with respect to Parent Common Stock. Accordingly, from and after the Effective Time: (A) each Company Option assumed by Parent may be exercised solely for shares of Parent Common Stock; (B) the number of shares of Parent Common Stock subject to each Company Option assumed by Parent shall be determined by multiplying the number of shares of Company Common Stock that were subject to such Company Option immediately prior to the Effective Time by the Exchange Ratio, and rounding the resulting number down to the nearest whole number of shares of Parent Common Stock; (C) the per share exercise price for the Parent Common Stock issuable upon exercise of each Company Option assumed by Parent shall be determined by dividing the per share exercise price of Company Common Stock subject to such Company Option, as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time, by the Exchange Ratio, and rounding the resulting exercise price up to the nearest whole cent; and (D) any restriction on the exercise of any Company Option assumed by Parent shall continue in full force and effect and the term, exercisability, vesting schedule and other provisions of such Company Option shall remain unchanged; _provided, however,_ that Parent Board or a committee thereof shall succeed to the authority and responsibility of the Company Board or any committee thereof with respect to each Company Option, Company Restricted Stock or Company RSUs assumed by Parent. 

  

 (b) Parent shall file with the SEC, no later than 10 business days after the date on which the Merger becomes effective, a registration statement on Form S-8, if available for use by Parent, relating to the shares of Parent Common Stock issuable with respect to the Company Options, Company Restricted Stock or Company RSUs assumed by Parent in accordance with Section 5.4(a). 

  

 (c) At the Effective Time, Parent shall assume all of the Company Option Plans. Parent shall be entitled to grant stock awards under each such Company Option Plan, to the extent permissible under applicable Legal Requirements, using the share reserves of such Company Option Plan as of the Effective Time (including any shares returned to such share reserves as a result of the termination of Company Options that are assumed by Parent pursuant to Section 5.4(a)), except that: (i) stock covered by such awards shall be shares of Parent Common Stock; (ii) all references in such Company Option Plan to a number of shares of Company Common Stock shall be deemed amended to refer instead to a number of shares of Parent Common Stock determined by multiplying the number of referenced shares of Company Common Stock by the Exchange Ratio, and rounding the resulting number down to the nearest whole number of shares of Parent Common Stock; and (iii) the Parent Board or a committee 

        
  

thereof shall succeed to the authority and responsibility of the Company
Board or any committee thereof with respect to the administration of such
Company Option Plan.

   

 (d) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to take all action that may be necessary (under the Company Option Plans and otherwise) to effectuate the provisions of this Section 5.4 and to ensure that, from and after the Effective Time, holders of Company Equity Awards have no rights with respect thereto other than those specifically provided in this Section 5.4. 

  

 (e) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall take all action that may be necessary to: (i) cause any outstanding offering period (or similar period during which Company Common Stock may be purchased) under the Company ESPP to be terminated as of the last business day prior to the date on which the Merger becomes effective (the last business day prior to the date on which the Merger becomes effective being referred to as the "Designated Date"); (ii) make any pro-rata adjustments that may be necessary to reflect the shortened offering period (or similar period), but otherwise treat such shortened offering period (or similar period) as a fully effective and completed offering period for all purposes under the Company ESPP; and (iii) cause the exercise as of the Designated Date of each outstanding purchase right under the Company ESPP; _provided, however_ , that the actions described in clauses "(i)" through "(iii)" of this sentence shall be conditioned upon the consummation of the Merger. On the Designated Date, the Company shall apply the funds credited as of such date under the Company ESPP within each participant\'s payroll withholding account to the purchase of whole shares of Company Common Stock in accordance with the terms of the Company ESPP. Immediately prior to and effective as of the Effective Time (and subject to the consummation of the Merger), the Company shall terminate the Company ESPP. 

  

 5.5 Employee Benefits. 

  

 (a) Parent agrees that, subject to any necessary transition period and subject to any applicable plan provisions, contractual requirements or Legal Requirements all employees of the Alamo Corporations who continue employment with Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any Subsidiary of the Surviving Corporation after the Effective Time ("Continuing Employees") shall be eligible to participate in Parent\'s health, vacation and 401(k) plans, to substantially the same extent as similarly situated employees of Parent. 

  

 (b) Nothing in this Section 5.5 or elsewhere in this Agreement shall be construed to create a right in any Company Associate to employment with Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any other Subsidiary of Parent. Except for Company Indemnified Persons to the extent of their respective rights pursuant to Section 5.6, no Company Associate, and no Continuing Employee, shall be deemed to be a third party beneficiary of this Agreement. Except for Parent Indemnified Persons to the extent of their respective rights pursuant to Section 5.6(b), no Parent Associate, shall be deemed to be a third party beneficiary of this Agreement. 

  

 (c) If requested in writing by Parent at least five days prior to the Closing, the Company shall take (or cause to be taken) all actions necessary or appropriate to terminate, effective no later than the day prior to the date on which the Merger becomes effective, any Company Employee Plan that contains a cash or deferred arrangement intended to qualify under Section 401(k) of the Code (a "Company 401(k) Plan"). If the Company is required to terminate any Company 401(k) Plan, then the Company shall provide to Parent prior to the Closing Date written evidence of the adoption by the Company Board of resolutions authorizing the termination of such Company 401(k) Plan (the form and substance of which resolutions shall be subject to the prior review of Parent). The Company also shall take, prior to the Effective Time, such other actions in furtherance of terminating such Company 401(k) Plan as Parent may reasonably request in writing. 

       

                                      
(d) With respect to each "employee benefit plan" as defined in Section 3(3)
of ERISA and each vacation and severance plan (that is not an "employee
benefit plan" as defined in Section 3(3) of ERISA) maintained by Parent or any
Subsidiary of Parent (collectively, the "Parent Benefit Plans") in which any
Continuing Employee will participate after the Effective Time, Parent shall,
or shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, recognize all service of
the Continuing Employees with the Company or a Subsidiary, as the case may
be, for purposes of eligibility, vesting and participation, in any such Parent
Benefit Plan to the extent such service was credited under the applicable
Company Benefit Plan. In addition, and subject to the concurrence of any
third-party insurers (which Parent shall use commercially reasonable efforts
to obtain), Parent shall or shall cause the Surviving Corporation to: (i)
waive all limitations as to preexisting conditions, exclusions and waiting

shall not have been approved at any adjournment or postponement thereof) by
the Required Parent Stockholder Vote; _provided, however_ , that a party shall
not be permitted to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this Section 8.1(e)
if the failure to have the issuance of Parent Common Stock in the Merger
approved by the Required Parent Stockholder Vote is attributable to a
failure on the part of such party to perform any covenant or obligation in
this Agreement required to be performed by such party at or prior to the
Effective Time;

   

 (f) by Parent (at any time prior to the adoption of this Agreement by the Required Company Stockholder Vote) if a Company Triggering Event shall have occurred;

 (j) by Parent if: (i) any of the Company\'s representations and warranties contained in this Agreement shall be inaccurate as of the date of this Agreement such that the condition set forth in Section 6.1(a) or the condition set forth in Section 6.1(b) would not be satisfied, or shall have become inaccurate as of a date subsequent to the date of this Agreement (as if made on such subsequent date) such that the condition set forth in Section 6.1(a) or the condition set forth in Section 6.1(b) would not be satisfied; or (ii) any of the Company\'s covenants or obligations contained in this Agreement shall have been breached such that the condition set forth in Section 6.2 would not be satisfied; _provided, however_ , that, for purposes of clauses "(i)" and "(ii)" above, if an inaccuracy in any of the Company\'s representations and warranties (as of the date of this Agreement or as of a date subsequent to the date of this Agreement) or a breach of a covenant or obligation by the Company is curable by the Company by the End Date and the Company is continuing to exercise its reasonable best efforts to cure such inaccuracy or breach, then Parent may not terminate this Agreement under this Section 8.1(j) on account of such inaccuracy or breach unless such inaccuracy or breach shall remain uncured for a period of 30 days commencing on the date that Parent gives the Company notice of such inaccuracy or breach; or 

  

 (k) by the Company if: (i) any of Parent\'s representations and warranties contained in this Agreement shall be inaccurate as of the date of this Agreement such that the condition set forth in Section 7.1(a) or the condition set forth in Section 7.1(b) would not be satisfied, or shall have become inaccurate as of a date subsequent to the date of this Agreement (as if made on such 

  

      

  
  

subsequent date) such that the condition set forth in Section 7.1(a) or the
condition set forth in Section 7.1(b) would not be satisfied; or (ii) any of
Parent\'s covenants or obligations contained in this Agreement shall have
been breached such that the condition set forth in Section 7.2 would not be
satisfied; _provided, however_ , that, for purposes of clauses "(i)" and
"(ii)" above, if an inaccuracy in any of Parent\'s representations and
warranties (as of the date of this Agreement or as of a date subsequent to
the date of this Agreement) or a breach of a covenant or obligation by Parent
is curable by Parent by the End Date and Parent is continuing to exercise its
reasonable best efforts to cure such inaccuracy or breach, then the Company
may not terminate this Agreement under this Section 8.1(k) on account of such
inaccuracy or breach unless such inaccuracy or breach shall remain uncured
for a period of 30 days commencing on the date that the Company gives Parent
notice of such inaccuracy or breach.

  

  

 8.2 Effect of Termination. In the event of the termination of this Agreement as provided in Section 8.1, this Agreement shall be of no further force or effect; _provided, however,_ that: (i) this Section 8.2, Section 8.3 and Section 9 shall survive the termination of this Agreement and shall remain in full force and effect; (ii) the Confidentiality Agreement shall survive the termination of this Agreement and shall remain in full force and effect in accordance with its terms; and (iii) the termination of this Agreement shall not relieve any party from any liability for any willful and material inaccuracy in or breach of any representation, warranty, covenant, obligation or other provision contained in this Agreement. 

  

 8.3 Expenses; Termination Fees. 

  

 (a) Except as set forth in this Section 8.3, all fees and expenses incurred in connection with this Agreement and the Contemplated Transactions shall be paid by the party incurring such expenses, whether or not the Merger is consummated; _provided, however,_ that Parent and the Company shall share equally all out-of-pocket fees and expenses, other than accountants\' and attorneys\' fees, incurred in connection with: (i) the filing, printing and mailing of the Form S-4 Registration Statement and the Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus and any amendments or supplements thereto; and (ii) the filing by the parties hereto of any notice or other document under the HSR Act. 

  

 (b) If this Agreement is terminated: (i) by Parent pursuant to Section 8.1(f); (ii) by the Company pursuant to Section 8.1(i); (iii) by the Company pursuant to Section 8.1(b) or 8.1(d) following a Company Change in Recommendation; or (iv) by Parent or the Company pursuant to Section 8.1(d), and in the case of clause "(iv)" of this sentence: (A) at or prior to the Company Stockholders\' Meeting an Acquisition Proposal with respect to an Alamo Corporation shall have been disclosed, announced, commenced, submitted or made (and shall not have been withdrawn); and (B) on or prior to the first anniversary of such termination of this Agreement, either: (1) an Acquisition Transaction with respect to an Alamo Corporation is consummated; or (2) a definitive agreement relating to an Acquisition Transaction with respect to an Alamo Corporation is entered into by an Alamo Corporation, then the Company shall pay to Parent, in cash at the time specified in the following sentence, a nonrefundable fee in the amount of $9 million (the "Company Termination Fee"). The Company Termination Fee shall be paid as follows: (x) in the case of clause "(i)" of the preceding sentence, within two business days after termination of this Agreement; (y) in the case of clause (ii) and (iii), simultaneously with the Company\'s termination of the Agreement; and (z) in the case of clause "(iv)" of the preceding sentence, within two business days after the first to occur of the consummation of the Acquisition Transaction or the entering into by an Alamo Corporation of the definitive agreement.

 If this Agreement is terminated by Parent or the Company pursuant to Section 8.1(d) and the Company is not then obligated to pay the Company Termination Fee, then the Company shall pay to Parent in cash within two business days after the termination of this Agreement an amount equal to $2 million (the "Company Expense Reimbursement Amount") in respect of Parent\'s expenses in connection with this Agreement, which shall be credited against any Company Termination Fee otherwise payable pursuant to this Section 8.3(b), if any.

 If this Agreement is terminated by Parent or the Company pursuant to Section 8.1(e) and Parent is not then obligated to pay the Parent Termination Fee, then Parent shall pay to the Company in cash within two business days after the termination of this Agreement an amount equal to $2 million (the "Parent Expense Reimbursement Amount" and, together with the Company Expense Reimbursement Amount, as applicable, an "Expense Reimbursement Amount") in respect of the Company\'s expenses in connection with this Agreement, which shall be credited against any Parent Termination Fee otherwise payable pursuant to this Section 8.3(c), if any. 

   

 (d) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement to the contrary, the parties agree that, except as provided in the last sentence of this Section 8.3(d), the payments contemplated by this Sections 8.3 represent the sole and exclusive remedy of the parties and that, except for the payments expressly set forth in this Section 8.3 and as provided in the last sentence of this Section 8.3(d), each of the parties and their respective affiliates shall have no liability, shall not be entitled to bring or maintain any other claim, action or proceeding against the other, shall be precluded from any other remedy against the other, at law or in equity or otherwise, and shall not seek to obtain any recovery, judgment or damages of any kind against the other (or any partner, member, stockholder, director, officer, employee, Subsidiary, affiliate, agent or other representative of such party or parties) in connection with or arising out of the termination of this Agreement, any breach of or by any party giving rise to such termination or the failure of the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement to be consummated. The parties agree that if (i) the termination of this Agreement resulted from the willful and material inaccuracy in or breach of any representation, warranty, covenant, obligation or other provision contained in this Agreement, (ii) an Expense Reimbursement Amount and/or Termination Fee is payable pursuant to the terms of this Agreement at or following a termination hereof and (iii) Parent or the Company, as applicable, has (A) notified the other party that 

        
  

it is not accepting any such Expense Reimbursement Amount or Termination Fee
payable to Parent or the Company hereunder and is waiving any right thereto,
which notification and waiver shall occur, if at all, (1) at the time of such
termination of this Agreement by such party, if such party is the party
terminating this Agreement, or (2) within five business days following
such termination of this Agreement, if the other party is the party
terminating this Agreement, and (B) refunded such Expense Reimbursement Amount
or Termination Fee in full to the party paying such Expense Reimbursement
Amount or Termination Fee within five business days following payment thereof,
if such Expense Reimbursement Amount or Termination Fee has been paid

Reimbursement Amount and/or Termination Fee shall not represent the sole and
exclusive remedy of the parties hereunder.

  

 (e) If a party fails to pay when due any amount payable by such party under this Section 8.3, then: (i) such party shall reimburse the other party for all costs and expenses (including reasonable fees and disbursements of counsel) incurred in connection with the collection of such overdue amount and the enforcement by the other party of its rights under this Section 8.3; and (ii) such party shall pay to the other party interest on such overdue amount (for the period commencing as of the date such overdue amount was originally required to be paid through the date such overdue amount is actually paid to the other party in full) at a rate per annum equal to the lower of: (i) 350 basis points over the "prime rate" (as announced by Bank of America, N.A. or any successor thereto) in effect on the date such overdue amount was originally required to be paid; or (ii) the maximum rate permitted by applicable Legal Requirements.

entire agreement and supersede all prior agreements and understandings, both
written and oral, among or between any of the parties with respect to the
subject matter hereof and thereof; _provided, however_ , that the

force and effect in accordance with its terms (it being understood that no

The parties hereto hereby agree that a final judgment in any such claim, suit, action or other proceeding will be conclusive, subject to any appeal, and may be enforced in other jurisdictions by suit on the judgment or in any other manner provided by applicable law. The parties agree that irreparable damage would occur and that the parties would not have any adequate remedy at law in the event that any of the provisions of this Agreement were not performed in accordance with their specific terms or were otherwise breached.

The Company Disclosure Schedule and Parent Disclosure Schedule shall each be delivered as of the date hereof, and no amendments or modifications thereto shall be made. Any purported update or modification to the Company Disclosure Schedule or Parent Disclosure Schedule after the date hereof shall be disregarded. 

   

 9.7 Attorneys\' Fees. In any action at law or suit in equity to enforce this Agreement or the rights of any of the parties hereunder, the prevailing party in such action or suit shall be entitled to

costs and expenses incurred in such action or suit.

   

 9.8 Assignability; No Third Party Rights. This Agreement shall be binding upon, and shall be enforceable by and inure solely to the benefit of, the parties hereto and their respective successors and assigns; _provided, however,_ that neither this Agreement nor any party\'s rights or obligations hereunder may be assigned or delegated by such party without the prior written consent of the other parties, and any attempted assignment or delegation of this Agreement or any of such rights or obligations by any party without the prior written consent of the other parties shall be void and of no effect.
