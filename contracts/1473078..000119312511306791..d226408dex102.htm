respective periods of ownership and an allocation percentage shall be established based on the ratio of the total amounts due to the State, if any, as between Buyer and Seller (the &#147;<B>Audit Allocation Percentages</B>&#148;); (ii)&nbsp;third

Sales Tax Audit shall be reimbursable to Manager (or Buyer) by Seller (and subject to allocation under the Audit Allocation Percentages); (iv)&nbsp;since Seller&#146;s Audit Allocation Percentage will be much larger than Buyer&#146;s, Seller
reserves all rights against Manager with respect to the Existing Sales Tax Audit and the State Sales Tax Audit, including the right to reasonably direct Manager, or to request that Buyer direct Manager, to respond to both sales tax audits with a

the cost to repair such uninsured casualty, Seller having the right, but not the obligation, to do so), either Buyer or Seller may, at its option terminate this Agreement by notice (&#147;<B>Section 6 Termination Notice</B>&#148;) to the other

of competent jurisdiction shall, pursuant to a final, non-appealable order in connection with such Proceeding, determine that (1)&nbsp;Seller was in breach of the applicable representation or warranty as of the date such representation or warranty
