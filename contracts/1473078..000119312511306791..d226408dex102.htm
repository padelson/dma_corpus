and those Agreements and Equipment Leases which Buyer elects to assume as of

Parties arising from or by reason of Buyers and/or Buyers Representatives
access to, or inspection of, the Property (including damage to property and

herein, Seller shall have no obligation to deliver to Buyer any property

connection with Buyers right to audit or audit reports set forth in Section

this Agreement.

(a) At the expiration of the Due Diligence Period this Agreement shall
continue in full force and effect unless, prior to the expiration of the Due
Diligence Period, Buyer shall have notified Seller and Escrow Agent in
writing of Buyers election not to proceed with the acquisition of the
Property (the "Buyers Termination Notice").

for in Section 3.1.7(a) above, the obligations of the parties hereunder shall
terminate (and no party hereto shall have any further obligation in connection

within three (3) business days after Buyers delivery of the Buyers
Termination Notice, less One Hundred Dollars ($100.00) (the "Independent
Consideration") which shall be delivered by Escrow Agent to Seller in
consideration of Seller having entered into this Agreement.

4\. Title and Survey Matters.

4.1 Seller has heretofore made available to Buyer (i) a title insurance
commitment covering the Hotel Unit issued by the Title Company as NBU No.
21121345; (ii) copies of the recorded documents evidencing the exceptions to
title stated in Schedule B-2 therein (collectively, the "Title Commitment");
and (iii) a copy the Survey of Denver Marriott Hotel Unit Condominium,
prepared by AEGIS Surveying, Inc. as Project No. 57301, dated April 11, 2007,
and last revised May 23, 2007 (the "Existing Survey").

 

4.2 Buyer shall satisfy itself prior to expiration of the Due Diligence Period
that the Title Company is willing, pursuant to the Title Commitment, to issue
a standard 2006 ALTA form of owners title insurance policy (the "Owners
Policy") with coverage in an amount equal to or less than the Purchase Price,
indicating the fee interest of the Hotel Unit including the Hotel Units
leasehold interest in the Ground Leases to be vested of record in Buyer,
subject solely to the "Permitted Exceptions" (as hereinafter defined). Unless
Buyer gives written notice ("Title Disapproval Notice") that it disapproves
the exceptions to title shown on the Title Commitment or the matters disclosed
by the Existing Survey, stating the title exceptions or Existing Survey matter
so disapproved, prior to the expiration of the Due Diligence Period, Buyer
shall be conclusively deemed to have approved the Existing Survey and the
Title Commitment. Upon receipt by Seller of a Title Disapproval Notice given
in a timely manner, Seller may elect to notify Buyer (being a "Seller
Response Notice") as to each disapproved matter either that: (i) Seller elects
not to cause such disapproved matter to be removed as of the Closing Date (or
otherwise take any action with respect thereto), or (ii) Seller intends to
either: (a) use commercially reasonable efforts to cause such disapproved
matter to be removed or released on the Closing Date; or (b) use commercially
reasonable efforts to cause the Title Company to insure over such disapproved
matter; provided, however, Seller shall have no liability if for any reason,
after electing either choice under (ii) above, such additional disapproved
matters are not removed, released, or insured over as aforesaid as of the
Closing Date and Buyer shall not be obligated to take title to the Property
subject to such disapproved matters and Buyer may elect to terminate this
Agreement. If Seller has provided a Seller Response Notice to Buyer by the
date which three (3) business days after the expiration of the Due Diligence
Period stating that Seller will not remove, release or otherwise correct such
disapproved exceptions or will not correct any disapproved Existing Survey
matter or if Seller has not provided a Seller Response Notice to Buyer prior
to the date which is three (3) business days after the expiration of the Due
Diligence Period (which shall be deemed an election by Seller not to take any
action with respect to such items), then Buyer may elect in writing not later
than two (2) business days after delivery of the Seller Response Notice,
either to waive Buyers objection to such disapproved exceptions or Existing
Survey matter or to terminate this Agreement. If Buyer shall fail to make
such election, then Buyer shall be deemed to have waived its objections to
such disapproved exceptions or Existing Survey matters. In the event Buyer
shall elect in writing to terminate this Agreement, the Deposit (less
the Independent Consideration) shall be

 



-7-   promptly delivered by the Escrow Agent to Buyer, and the parties shall have
no further obligations or liabilities hereunder (except for any obligations or
liabilities that expressly survive termination of this Agreement). Anything
to the contrary notwithstanding, if a Title Disapproval Notice is delivered by
Buyer, Buyer may elect terminate this Agreement after the expiration of the
Due Diligence Period only within the time period established therefor and
solely for disapproved matters raised in the Title Disapproval Notice (i)
which Seller elects not to cause to be removed as of the Closing Date, and
(ii) to which Buyer has not waived its objection to the same. 

4.3 It is understood that Buyer may request a number of endorsements to or
extended coverage for the Owners Policy. Buyer shall satisfy itself prior to
the expiration of the Due Diligence Period that the Title Company will be
willing to issue such endorsements or extended coverage in connection with the
Owners Policy, and, accordingly, in no event shall the issuance of such
endorsements, extended coverage or the Owners Policy constitute a condition
to Buyers obligations under this Agreement.

4.4 As used herein: "Permitted Exceptions" means the following: (1) the lien
of any unpaid real estate taxes and assessments for the year 2011, and
subsequent periods, not due and payable as of Closing; (2) such other matters
set forth in the Title Commitment or Survey which are approved or deemed
approved, pursuant to the terms hereof, by Buyer during the Due Diligence
Period (in any event to include the exceptions listed in _Exhibit "D_ "); (3)
any New Matter (as hereinafter defined) which has been approved, or deemed
approved by Buyer, pursuant to Section 4.6 below; (4) the printed exceptions
which appear in the standard ALTA form of owners policy of title insurance
issued by Title Company in the State of Colorado; and (5) all other matters of
public record, including, but not limited to, all building, signage and zoning
ordinances, laws, regulations and restrictions by or of municipal and other
governmental authorities; provided that in no event shall any existing liens
or encumbrances created by Seller, including but not limited to, any deeds of
trust or other security documents, be considered Permitted Exceptions. After
Closing, Seller shall have no liability to Buyer, and Buyer and its successors
and assigns shall make no claim against Seller for the Permitted Exceptions.
This provision shall survive the Closing.

 

4.5 Buyer shall have the right, at Buyers sole cost and expense, to update
the Existing Survey prior to the expiration of the Due Diligence Period. In
no event will the update to such Existing Survey be deemed to result in a New
Matter (as defined below) as to the Property.

4.6 If an additional exception to title ("New Matter") affecting the Property
is first disclosed to Buyer after the expiration of the Due Diligence Period,
Buyer shall be deemed to have approved any such New Matter within five (5)
days of Buyers discovery of such New Matter unless Buyer delivers to Seller
within such time written notice of its objection thereto. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, any New Matter that is the result of the activities of Buyer, or
that does not adversely impact the marketability of such title or have a
material adverse effect on the ownership of the Property or operation of the
Hotel after the Closing, shall be deemed approved by Buyer, and Buyer shall
have no right to object to such New Matter. Seller may elect to use reasonable
efforts to remove or cause the Title Company to bond, insure or endorse over
such New Matter within thirty (30) days from the date of receipt of notice
from Buyer with respect to the New Matter (and the Closing Date shall be
extended to accommodate such cure period). In the event that within such
thirty (30) day period Seller (1) does not elect to remove or cause the Title
Company to bond, insure or endorse over such New Matter, or (2) elects but
fails to remove or cause the Title Company to bond, insure or endorse over
such New Matter, then upon the expiration of such period, Buyer, as its sole
and exclusive remedy hereunder for such failure, shall elect in writing
either (a) to terminate this

 



-8-   Agreement by written notice to Seller, in which case the Deposit (less the
Independent Consideration) shall be returned to Buyer, this Agreement shall be
null and void and of no further force or effect and the parties hereto shall
have no further obligations to the other (except for any obligations or
liabilities that expressly survive termination of this Agreement), or (b) to
waive the foregoing right of termination and all other rights and remedies on
account of such New Matter and to close the transaction contemplated by this
Agreement, without any reduction or abatement of the Purchase Price. If Buyer
shall fail to make such election, then Buyer shall be deemed to have waived
its objections to such disapproved New Matter.

4.7 Notwithstanding the foregoing, Seller shall convey the Hotel Unit to
Buyer through the form of special warranty deed (or its equivalent) attached
hereto as _Exhibit "C_ " (the "Deed"), which will convey the Hotel Unit to
Buyer subject to the Permitted Exceptions, as well as any matters disclosed
by the public records, and any other exceptions to title, including, but not
limited to (i) all building, signage and zoning ordinances, laws, regulations
and restrictions by or of municipal and other governmental authorities, and
(ii) road, highway, pipeline, railroad and utility easements, conditions and
encroachments, which would be disclosed by an inspection and/or survey of the
Property (together with the Permitted Exceptions, the "Deed Exceptions"). All
appurtenances to title to the Hotel Unit shall be as are conveyed specifically
in the Deed. After Closing, Seller shall have no liability to Buyer, and Buyer
and its successors and assigns shall make no claim against Seller for the
Deed Exceptions. This provision shall survive the Closing.

5\. _Conditions Precedent_. The obligation of Buyer to purchase, and Seller
to sell the Property as contemplated by this Agreement is subject to
satisfaction of each of the following respective conditions precedent (any of
which may be waived in writing by the party in whose favor such condition
exists). If any of such conditions is not fulfilled (or so waived) pursuant to
the terms of this Agreement, then, except as expressly provided in this
Agreement, the party in whose favor such condition exists may elect not to
proceed with this Agreement and, in connection with any such election made in
accordance with this Section 5, Seller and Buyer shall be released from
further obligation or liability hereunder (except for those obligations and
liabilities which, pursuant to the terms of this Agreement, survive such
termination [and without releasing any party for a breach or default occurring
prior to such termination]), and the Deposit shall be disposed of in
accordance with Section 10\.

 

5.1 _Estoppel Certificates_.

_5.1.1_ _Condominium Declaration_. Receipt of an estoppel certificate with
respect to the Condominium Declaration in a form containing such content as is
provided for in the Condominium Declaration, shall be a condition precedent

Seller shall request an estoppel certificate with respect to the Condominium
Declaration in the form attached hereto as  _Exhibit "W"_.

_5.1.2_ _Master Declaration_. Receipt of an estoppel certificate with respect
to the Master Declaration in a form containing such content as is provided for

form attached hereto as _Exhibit "X"_.

_5.1.3_ _Ground Leases_. Receipt of an estoppel certificate from the landlord
under each of the Ground Leases, in a form containing such content as is
provided for 

 



-9-   in each of such Ground Leases, shall be a condition precedent to Buyers
obligation to acquire the Property hereunder; provided, however, Seller shall
request an estoppel certificate with respect to each Ground Lease in the form
attached hereto as _Exhibit "Y"_.

_5.1.4_   _Management Agreement_. Receipt of an estoppel certificate from
Manager, as to the Management Agreement, in a form containing such content as
is provided for in the Management Agreement, shall be a condition precedent to
Buyers obligation to acquire the Property hereunder; provided, however,
Seller shall request an estoppel certificate with respect to the Management
Agreement in the form attached hereto as _Exhibit "Z"_. To the extent required
by the terms and provisions of the Management Agreement, a consent from
Manager of the assignment and assumption of the Management Agreement from
Buyer to Seller shall also be a condition precedent to Buyers obligation to
acquire the Property hereunder. 

_5.1.5_ _Parking Easement Agreement_. Receipt of an estoppel certificate from
the grantor under the Parking Easement Agreement, in a form containing such
content as is provided for in the Parking Easement Agreement shall be a
condition precedent to Buyers obligation to acquire the Property hereunder.

 

 _5.1.6_ _Extension of Closing Date_.

 

(a) If Seller has not received any estoppel certificate, consent or approval,
receipt of which is a condition precedent to Buyers obligation to acquire
the Property hereunder, Seller may, upon written notice to Buyer delivered on
or before the Closing Date then scheduled under this Agreement, extend the
Closing Date for a period of up to thirty (30) days to provide additional
time to obtain such estoppel certificate(s), consent or approval. If Seller
has exercised its extension option under this Section 5.1.6 but the required
estoppel certificate, consent or approval has not been obtained as of the
Closing Date, as extended pursuant to this Section 5.1.6, then this Agreement
shall terminate, except the provisions hereof or thereof which expressly
survive termination, and Buyer shall receive a refund of the Deposit (less
the Independent Consideration).

(b) Anything to the contrary in this Section 5.1.6 notwithstanding,
Buyer acknowledges that, if an original of any required estoppel certificate,
consent or approval is not available at Closing, Seller may deliver an
electronic copy (a .pdf or .tif file) of such estoppel certificate, consent or
approval, and, so long as Seller delivers the original of such estoppel
certificate, consent or approval within ten (10) business days after Closing,
Seller shall be deemed to have satisfied the requirement under this Agreement
of the delivery of such estoppel certificate, consent or approval, and the
unavailability of the original of such document shall not delay the Closing.
The provisions of this Section 5.1.6(b) shall survive Closing.

 

5.2 _Intentionally Deleted_.

5.3 _No Bankruptcy or Dissolution_. A condition precedent to Sellers
obligation to sell the Property shall be that that at no time on or before the
Closing Date shall any "Bankruptcy/Dissolution Event" (as hereinafter
defined) have occurred with respect to Buyer, and if Buyer is a partnership or
limited liability company, any general partners or managing members, as the
case may be, of Buyer. A condition precedent to Buyers obligation to
purchase the Property shall be that that at no time on or before the Closing
Date shall any Bankruptcy/Dissolution Event have occurred with respect to
Seller or any managing members of Seller.

 



-10-  5.4 _Performance by Seller_. The performance and observance, in all material
respects, by Seller of all covenants and agreements of this Agreement to be
performed or observed by Seller prior to or on the Closing Date under this
Agreement shall be a condition precedent to Buyers obligation to purchase the
Property. In addition, a condition precedent to Buyers obligation to
purchase the Property shall be that the representations and warranties of
Seller are true and correct in all material respects as of the Closing Date as
if made on such Closing Date. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event a
material change of circumstances not otherwise contemplated by this Agreement
and which was not caused by Sellers intentional breach of any of its
obligations hereunder occurs on or prior to the Closing Date which causes any
of Sellers representations or warranties set forth in Section 8.1 to become
untrue or in the event of an unintentional breach or unintentional default by
Seller which causes any of Sellers covenants to be untrue, in any event,
such that the failure or failures of all such representations and warranties
to be so true and correct would have a material adverse effect on the Property
or the purchase and sale agreement contemplated by this Agreement (a
"Change of Circumstances"), and, in either case, in the event that Buyer is
not willing to waive its objection thereto, Seller shall have a period of
thirty (30) days from the date of the discovery by Seller of such Change of
Circumstances to cure such untrue fact, condition or covenant (and the
Closing Date shall be extended to accommodate such cure period). In the event
that Seller does not cure such Change of Circumstances within such thirty (30)
day period, Buyer shall have the right, as Buyers sole and exclusive remedy
hereunder for such failure, either (a) to terminate this Agreement by written
notice to Seller, in which case, this Agreement shall be null and void and of
no further force or effect and the parties hereto shall have no further
obligations to the other and the Deposit (less the Independent Consideration)
shall be refunded to Buyer, or (b) to waive the foregoing right of termination
and all other rights and remedies on account of such breach or default and to
close the transaction contemplated by this Agreement. Notwithstanding anything
in this Section 5.4 to the contrary, the foregoing procedure with respect to a
Change of Circumstances shall not be applicable to the intentional breach by
Seller of any of its obligations hereunder, it being understood that the
remedy for such a breach by Seller shall be in accordance with Section 10.1
hereof.

 

5.5 _Performance by Buyer_. The performance and observance, in all material
respects, by Buyer of all covenants and agreements of this Agreement to be
performed or observed by Buyer prior to or on the Closing Date under this
Agreement shall be a condition precedent to Sellers obligation to sell the
Property. In addition, a condition precedent to Sellers obligation to sell
the Property shall be that the representations and warranties of Buyer are
true and correct in all material respects as of the Closing Date as if made on
such Closing Date.

 

5.6 _Adverse Proceedings_. As a mutual condition precedent to either partys
obligation to consummate the transaction contemplated hereunder, no
litigation or other court action shall have been commenced by any third party
that is not an affiliate of Buyer or Seller, seeking to obtain an injunction
or other relief from such court to enjoin the consummation of the transaction
described in this Agreement, and no preliminary or permanent injunction or
other order, decree or ruling shall have been issued by a court of competent
jurisdiction or by any governmental authority or applicable law been enacted,
that would make illegal or invalid or otherwise prevent the consummation of
the transaction described in this Agreement.

5.7  _Owner s Policy_. The Title Company shall have committed to issue the
Owners Policy pursuant to Section 4.2, subject only to the Permitted
Exceptions and to the payment of any premium with respect to the issuance of
such policy. 

 



-11-  5.8 _Consequence of Failure of a Closing Condition_. If either Buyer or Seller
has the right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this Section 5, then
the party exercising its termination rights hereunder shall notify in writing
the other party and Escrow Agent of such election (a "Section 5
Termination Notice") prior to the Closing Date (or prior to the earlier date
which may be required for such termination under the terms of this Agreement),
and the specific condition or conditions giving rise to such election. If
either party shall deliver a Section 5 Termination Notice, and such notice is
accompanied by a demand that Escrow Agent deliver the Deposit to such party,
Escrow Agent shall promptly request from the non-requesting party written
confirmation that release of the Deposit to the requesting party is
acceptable and upon receipt of such written confirmation (or if no written
confirmation or objection is received within five (5) business days of Escrow
Agents request therefor), Escrow Agent shall deliver the Deposit to the
requesting party as demanded, less the Independent Consideration, which shall
be paid to Seller in all cases. If the non-requesting party raises an
objection to release of the Deposit, the procedures set forth in the Deposit
Escrow Agreement shall govern Escrow Agents obligation to release the Deposit
hereunder.

6\. _Closing Procedure_. The sale and purchase herein provided shall be
consummated (the "Closing") through and pursuant to the Escrow Instructions
(as defined below).

6.1 _Escrow_. On or before 1:00 p.m. Central time on the Closing Date, the

of the parties to conform to the facts and circumstances of closing. The
conditions to the closing of such escrow shall include the Escrow Agents
receipt of the Closing Payment (or confirmation of the receipt thereof by
Seller) and a notice (which may be by email) from each of Buyer and Seller
authorizing Title Company to close the transactions as contemplated herein
(each of Buyer and Seller being obligated to deliver such authorization notice

party is in a position to deliver the items to be delivered by such other
party under Section 6.2 below)

the Hotel;

(n) Each of the estoppel certificates described in Section 5.1 (and subject to
Section 5.1.6(b)), in each case, certifying that Seller is not in default

marketability of title to the Property or have a material adverse effect on

obligations of, Buyer in a manner not otherwise provided for herein).

6.3 _Closing Costs_. With reference to Closing, Seller shall pay (1) 50% of
all escrow charges, (2) the brokerage commission referenced in Section 12.1.2
of this Agreement, (3) the standard premium charged by the Title Company for
the ALTA standard coverage portion of the Owners Policy, and (4) any costs
associated with releasing any deeds of trust or other security

 



-14-   documents. Buyer shall pay (1) all documentary fees and other transfer fees
payable and recording charges, if any, in connection with the transfer
contemplated hereby, (2) the incremental premium charged by the Title Company
for the ALTA extended coverage portion of the Title Policy and the cost of all
endorsements to the Title Policy, (3) Buyers due diligence costs and property
inspection fees, including the cost of any additional environmental,
asbestos, structural and physical audits it deems necessary, (4) the costs, if
any, to update the Existing Survey, (5) any personal property sales tax, and
(6) 50% of all escrow charges. 

6.4 _Adjustments, Allocations and Prorations_. At the Closing, Seller shall
receive, in addition to the Purchase Price, and in lieu of all prorations
under this Agreement (except as specifically provided in this Section 6.4),
the sum of Three Hundred Thirty Eight Thousand Four Hundred Ninety and No/100
Dollars ($338,490.00) in cash or as a credit to the Seller on the Closing
Statement, which is the amount of "Working Capital" held by Manager under the
Management Agreement. Except as specifically provided in this Section 6.4,
there shall be no other prorations or re-prorations under the Agreement. At
Closing, the "Working Capital" under the Management Agreement shall be deemed
transferred from Seller to Buyer and belong to Buyer.

_6.4.1_ _Net Distributions To Owner under the Management Agreement_. If the
Closing occurs on any day when any portion of the net distribution due and
owing to the Owner under the Management Agreement has not been paid by
Manager to Seller, the distribution under the Management Agreement for any
accounting period in which Seller was the owner of the Property for the entire
accounting period shall belong solely to Seller (and Manager shall be
directed to pay the same to Seller); provided, however, if Manager pays such
funds to Buyer, despite the direction to pay the same to Seller, Buyer shall
pay such amount to Seller within three (3) business days after receipt of
the same. For the accounting period in which the Closing occurs, the net
distribution due and owing to the Owner under the Management Agreement shall
be prorated between Buyer and Seller based on the number of days in such
period and the respective ownership periods of each party therein (with the
Closing Date belonging to Buyer). Any distribution amount under the Management
Agreement referred to above that cannot be determined and paid at Closing
shall be paid and allocated between Seller and Buyer as provided above, by
Manager based on direction from Buyer and Seller to Manager, or, if Manager
pays such distribution amount to one (or both) of the parties in a manner
other than as allocated above, the parties will adjust such amounts within
three (3) business days after receipt of such funds with the party receiving
excess funds paying the other party the amount due as provided above. It is
anticipated that all amounts shall be allocated and paid within twenty-
five (25) days after the end of the accounting period under the Management
Agreement during which Closing occurs.

_6.4.2_ _Real Property and Personal Property Taxes_. Anything in Section 6.4.1
to the contrary notwithstanding, real property taxes (Parcel ID
02345-16-018-018) and personal property taxes (Parcel ID 236413001) shall be
re-prorated based on actual bills for calendar year 2011 (regardless of when
the actual amounts of such taxes are due and payable) by comparing the amount
of such bills against the accrual for real estate taxes and personal property
taxes by Manager for calendar year 2011 and any difference shall be adjusted
between Seller and Buyer based on the number of days in 2011 that each was the
owner of the Property. If such difference is positive, (i.e., such
actual taxes were higher than the accrual) Seller shall pay its share of such
excess (the number of Sellers days of ownership divided by 365 multiplied by
such difference) to Buyer and if the difference is negative, (i.e., such
actual taxes were lower

 



-15-   than the accrual) Buyer shall pay such savings to Seller based on the number
of Sellers days of ownership divided by 365 multiplied by such difference.
Any such re-proration shall be completed and paid within thirty (30) days
after the such amounts are able to be calculated.

 

 _6.4.3_ _Equipment Reserve_. The aggregate amount of the Equipment Reserve
shall belong to Buyer, and Seller shall receive a credit for the same at
Closing (in addition to the Purchase Price); provided, however, in no event
shall the amount of the credit given to Seller for the Equipment Reserve be
less than the amount existing in the Equipment Reserve on the Closing Date
plus (a) amounts then accrued for deposit into the Equipment Reserve by
Manager but not yet deposited therein and (b) amounts to be accrued by Manager
for the accounting period in which Closing occurs (which shall be prorated
between Buyer and Seller on a daily basis as to any amounts to be accrued for
the Hotel accounting period including Closing; items (a) and (b) collectively,
the "Accrued Amounts"), less (c) amounts expended by Manager but not yet
reimbursed out of the Equipment Reserve (the "Expended Amounts"). At Closing,
the Equipment Reserve shall be deemed transferred from Seller to Buyer and
belong to Buyer. Any Accrued Amounts and/or Expended Amounts that cannot be
computed at Closing shall be paid and allocated between Seller and Buyer as
provided above, and Buyer or Seller, as the case may be, shall pay to the
other party any amount due calculated as provided above. It is
anticipated that all amounts shall be allocated and paid within twenty-five
(25) days after the end of the accounting period under the Management
Agreement during which Closing occurs.

 

 _6.4.4_ _Deposits under Ground Leases and Declarations_. The aggregate amount
of any security or other deposits held for the account of Seller under the
Ground Leases, Condominium Declaration or the Master Declaration shall belong
to Buyer, and Seller shall receive a credit for the same at Closing.

 

 _6.4.5_ _Hotel Receivables_. All accounts receivables, including, without
limitation, credit card sales with respect to the Property shall belong to
Buyer and shall not be subject to proration or reproration.

 

 _6.4.6_ _Inventories, Employment Costs and Other Costs, Liabilities and
Expenses_. The allocation of Working Capital as provided above is in lieu of
a proration of inventories, employment costs, condominium and master
declaration assessments and other charges, liabilities and expenses.

 

 _6.4.7_ _Indemnification_. Buyer acknowledges that employees of the Property
are the employees of Manager and not of Seller, and that Buyer has no right
to cause the termination of such employees. In no event shall Buyer take any
action as to such employees of Manager that would create or cause any
liability to Seller. Buyer shall be solely responsible for all wages,
salaries, any bonuses, employment taxes, withholding taxes, and any and all
vacation days, sick days and personal days, if applicable, existing on or
accruing on or after the Closing Date. From and after the Closing, Buyer shall
indemnify and save Seller harmless from and against any claim by any employee
arising from Buyers actions and omissions as to any employees of Manager.
Except as provided in this Section 6.4, Seller shall have no further liability
for any obligations with respect to the operation of the Property, and Buyer
shall pay and discharge all costs and expenses of the Property, regardless of
when arising or accruing and Buyer shall indemnify, protect, defend and hold
the Seller harmless from and against any claim arising from the non-payment
of any of the items with respect to the Property regardless of when arising or
accruing, plus penalties, fines, fees, interest and other charges thereon or
related 

 



-16-   thereto imposed by third parties or by law in connection with such non-
payment; provided, however, the parties intend that the same shall not limit
Sellers obligation for a breach of representation or warranty under this
Agreement (as limited hereby) with respect to Sellers representations and
warranties under Sections 8.1.5, 8.1.7, 8.1.8, 8.1.9, 8.1.12 and 8.1.15 of
this Agreement provided the aggregate liability therefor exceeds $119,000.00.

_6.4.8_ _Items for Which There Will Not be a Proration_. Seller and
Buyer agree that (a) none of the insurance policies relating to the Property
will be assigned to Buyer, and Buyer shall be responsible for arranging for
its own insurance as of the Closing Date; and (b) Buyer shall be responsible
for all the necessary actions needed to arrange for utilities to be
transferred to the name of Buyer beginning 12:01 A.M. on the Closing Date,
including the posting of any required deposits to the extent that such
deposits will be returned to Seller. Accordingly, there will be no prorations
for insurance or utilities; provided, if any required deposit will not be
returned to Seller, Seller will receive a credit at Closing in the amount of
such deposit. Seller shall be entitled to receive and be returned any
deposits Seller may have with any utility companies, or will receive a credit
at Closing from Buyer to the extent such deposits are not remitted to Seller
and Buyer shall pay, or cause Manager to pay, any unpaid utility charges
with respect to the Property as shown on all utility bills issued with
respect to the Property and paid in the ordinary course of business by
Manager. The foregoing notwithstanding, Seller shall direct its insurer to pay
Manager or Buyer any prepaid insurance premium refund under Sellers existing
insurance policies relating to the Property; provided, however, if any such
refund is paid to Seller, despite Sellers direction to the contrary, Seller
shall pay such amount to Buyer (or to Manager, if Buyer so directs) within
three (3) business days after receipt of the same.

_6.4.9_   _Survival of Section 6.4_. The obligations and rights of the
parties under this Section 6.4 shall survive the Closing.

6.5 _Extension of Closing_. So long as such party is not then in default under
this Agreement, in the event that, as of the Closing Date, the consent of the
ground lessor under the Perry Lease has not been obtained, either party may,
upon written notice to the other party delivered on or before the original
Closing Date, extend the Closing Date for a period of up to sixty (60) days to
provide additional time to obtain the consent of the ground lessor under the
Perry Lease. In the event the parties have exercised their extension option
under this Section 6.5 but the consent of the ground lessor under the Perry
Lease has not been obtained as of the Closing Date, as extended pursuant to
this Section 6.5, then this Agreement shall terminate, except the provisions
hereof or thereof which expressly survive termination, and Buyer shall receive
a refund of the Deposit (less the Independent Consideration).

 

6.6 _Sales Tax Audits_. If the sales tax audit currently being conducted by
the City and County of Denver with respect to the Property (the "Existing
Sales Tax Audit") shall not have been settled, beyond appeal, at the
expiration of the Survival Period, Seller shall deposit into an escrow, to be
held by Escrow Agent, an amount (the "Audit Escrow Amount") equal to the
alleged unpaid sales taxes, and related penalties and interest, claimed by the
City and County of Denver (regardless of whether the same are then being
disputed by Seller) as of the expiration of the Survival Period. The Audit
Escrow Amount shall be held by Escrow Agent pursuant to a post-closing escrow
agreement in a form to be agreed upon by Buyer and Seller prior to the
expiration of the Survival Period so that the amount so held shall be
available to pay amounts due upon settlement of such sales tax audit by
Seller, provided, however, the Audit Escrow Amount shall not limit Sellers
liability with

 



-17-   respect to the Sales Tax Audit. On the Effective Date, Manager and Seller
received notice of a sales tax audit from the Colorado Department of Revenue
("State") covering the period from October 2008 to and including September
2011 (the "State Sales Tax Audit") and with respect thereto: (i) each party
shall bear their allocable share of amounts that may ultimately be due to the
State based on their respective periods of ownership and an allocation
percentage shall be established based on the ratio of the total amounts due to
the State, if any, as between Buyer and Seller (the "Audit Allocation
Percentages"); (ii) third party costs and expenses shall initially be paid by
Seller but shall ultimately be allocated between Buyer and Seller based on the
Audit Allocation Percentages; (iii) incremental out of pocket costs and
expenses of Manager in handling the State Sales Tax Audit shall be
reimbursable to Manager (or Buyer) by Seller (and subject to allocation under
the Audit Allocation Percentages); (iv) since Sellers Audit Allocation
Percentage will be much larger than Buyers, Seller reserves all rights
against Manager with respect to the Existing Sales Tax Audit and the State
Sales Tax Audit, including the right to reasonably direct Manager, or to
request that Buyer direct Manager, to respond to both sales tax audits with
a view towards reducing liability thereunder; and (v) Sellers obligation to
pay its share of amounts under the State Sales Tax Audit shall not be limited
by time (as between the parties hereto) and shall not be subject to, or used
in connection with, computing amounts under Section 8.6 of this Agreement.
With respect to all matters covered by this Section 6.6, Sellers obligation
under this Section 6.6 will be based the actual loss of profit to Buyer
taking into account the effects of the Incentive Management Fee under the
Management Agreement.

7\. _Condemnation or Destruction of Property_. In the event that, after the
date hereof but prior to the Closing Date, either any portion of the Property
is taken pursuant to eminent domain proceedings, or any of the improvements on
the Property are damaged or destroyed by any casualty, Seller shall not have
any obligation to repair or replace any such damage or destruction, but Seller
shall be required to give Buyer written notice of the same within five (5)
business days after Seller learns of such casualty or condemnation. Seller
shall also deliver and assign to Buyer, upon consummation of the transaction
herein provided (except to the extent any condemnation proceeds or insurance
proceeds are attributable to lost rents or revenues or other items applicable
to any period prior to the Closing), and subject to the requirements of the
Condominium Declaration, Master Declaration and the Ground Leases, all claims
of Seller respecting any condemnation or casualty insurance coverage, as
applicable, and all condemnation proceeds, or proceeds from any such casualty
insurance received by Seller on account of any casualty (except to the extent
required for collection costs or repairs by Seller prior to the Closing Date),
as applicable. There shall be no reduction of the Purchase Price on account
of any casualty or condemnation (except that in connection with a casualty
covered by insurance, Buyer shall be credited with the lesser of the remaining
cost to repair the damage or destruction caused by such casualty or the
amount of the deductible under Sellers casualty insurance policy except to
the extent such deductible was expended by Seller to repair the resulting
damage). In the event the condemnation award or the cost of repair of damage
to the Property on account of a casualty, as applicable, shall exceed ten
percent (10%) of the Purchase Price as to the Property (or if a casualty is
uninsured and Seller does not elect to credit Buyer with an amount equal
to the cost to repair such uninsured casualty, Seller having the right, but
not the obligation, to do so), either Buyer or Seller may, at its option
terminate this Agreement by notice ("Section 6 Termination Notice") to the
other party, given on or before the sooner to occur of the Closing Date or
five (5) business days after Seller learns of such casualty or condemnation,
in which event the Deposit (less the Independent Consideration) shall be
returned to Buyer and neither party shall have any further obligation
hereunder except for those obligations which expressly survive a termination
of this Agreement.

8\. _Representations and Warranties; Certain Covenants_.

8.1  _Representations and Warranties of Seller_. Seller hereby represents and
warrants to Buyer that, except as otherwise expressly set forth below, the
following statements are true and correct as of the Effective Date:

 

 _8.1.1_ _Authority_. Seller is duly organized, validly existing, and in good
standing in the State of Delaware and, to the extent required by law, is
qualified to do business

 



-18-   in the jurisdiction in which the Property is located, and has all requisite
power and authority to own the Property and conduct the business as currently
owned and conducted. Seller has all requisite power and authority to execute
and deliver, and to perform all of its obligations under, this Agreement.

_8.1.2_ _Due Execution_. This Agreement and the other documents to be executed
and delivered by Seller hereunder constitute or will constitute (as of the
date the same are executed) a legal, valid and binding obligation of Seller
in accordance with their respective terms. The execution, delivery and
performance of this Agreement and the other documents to be executed and
delivered by Seller hereunder have been duly authorized by all necessary
action on the part of Seller and do not and will not (a) require any consent

shall protect, defend,

 



-25-   indemnify and hold Seller and Sellers employees, officers, directors,

8.4 _Survival_. Except as otherwise provided in this Agreement, any of the
closing documents or this Section 8.4, the representations, warranties and
covenants of Seller under this Agreement, and in any certificate or document
delivered pursuant hereto or in connection herewith, shall survive the
Closing for a period of nine (9) months from the Closing Date (such period,
the "Survival Period"); provided that the representations and warranties of
Seller in Sections 8.1.1, 8.1.2, 8.1.3 and 8.1.14 shall survive the Closing
until the expiration of the applicable statute of limitations and the
representation and warranty contained in Section 8.1.15 shall survive Closing
for a period of one (1) year. Except as otherwise provided in this Section
8.4, each such representation, warranty and covenant of Seller shall
automatically be null and void and of no further force and effect on the first
day following the expiration of the Survival Period, unless, prior to the
expiration of such Survival Period, as to any applicable representation,
warranty or covenant, Buyer shall have provided Seller with written notice
alleging that Seller is in breach of such representation, warranty or
covenant, and specifying in reasonable detail the nature of such breach.
Buyer shall allow Seller sixty (60) days after Buyers notice within which to
cure such breach or if such breach cannot be cured within such sixty (60) day
period, and Seller notifies Buyer it wishes to extend its cure period (the
"Cure Extension Notice"), such additional reasonable period of time (not to
exceed an additional sixty (60) days) as is required to cure the same so long
as such cure has been commenced within such sixty (60) day period and is
being diligently pursued to completion. If Seller fails to cure such breach
after written notice thereof, Buyers sole remedy shall be to commence a legal
proceeding against Seller alleging that Seller has breached such
representation, warranty or covenant and that Buyer has suffered actual
damages as a result thereof (a "Proceeding"), which Proceeding must be
commenced, if at all, within sixty (60) days after the expiration of the
Survival Period, provided, however, that if Buyer gives Seller written notice
of such a breach within the Survival Period, and Seller subsequently sends a
Cure Extension Notice, then Buyer shall have until the date which is thirty
(30) days after the date Seller notifies Buyer it has ceased endeavoring to
cure such breach, to commence such Proceeding. If Buyer shall have timely
delivered the written notice and commenced a Proceeding in accordance with
this Section 8.4, and a court of competent jurisdiction shall, pursuant to a
final, non-appealable order in connection with such Proceeding, determine that
(1) Seller was in breach of the applicable representation or warranty as of
the date such representation or warranty was made, and (2) Buyer suffered
actual damages (the "Damages") by reason of such breach, (3) Buyer did not
have actual knowledge of such breach on or prior to the Closing Date, and (4)
Buyer could not have learned of such breach through the exercise of
reasonable diligence prior to the Closing Date, then Buyer shall be entitled
to receive an amount equal to the Damages, subject, in any event, to the
limitations set forth in Section 8.5. Any such Damages, subject to the
limitations contained herein, shall be paid within thirty (30) days following
the entry of such final, non-appealable order and delivery of a copy thereof
to Seller. The representations, warranties and covenants of Buyer under this
Agreement, and in any certificate or document delivered pursuant hereto or in
connection herewith, shall survive the Closing until the expiration of the
applicable statue of limitations.

 



-26-  8.5 _Knowledge as a Defense_. Seller shall have no liability with respect to a
breach of the representations and warranties of Seller under this Agreement
to the extent that Buyer proceeds with the closing of the transaction
contemplated hereby with actual knowledge of such breach, or if Buyer could
have identified such breach through the exercise of reasonable diligence
prior to the Closing Date.

8.6 _Limitation on Damages_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set
forth in this Agreement, Sellers liability for breach of any covenant,
representation or warranty of Seller contained in this Agreement and in any
document executed by Seller pursuant to this Agreement, (other than Sellers
obligations under Sections 6.4 and 12.1, to which the limitations under this
Section 8.5 shall not apply) or any other instruments delivered at Closing,
shall, subject to the limitations of survival set forth in this Section 8, be
limited to claims in excess of one tenth of one percent (i.e., 0.1%) of the
Purchase Price in the aggregate, and the total aggregate liability of Seller
for any and all claims arising out of any such covenants, representations
and warranties shall not exceed an amount equal to three percent (i.e., 3%)
of the Purchase Price. In addition, in no event shall Seller be liable for any
incidental, consequential, indirect, punitive, special or exemplary damages,
or for lost profits, unrealized expectations or other similar claims, and in
every case Buyers recovery for any claims referenced above shall be net of
any insurance proceeds and any indemnity, contribution or other similar
payment recovered or recoverable by Buyer from any insurance company or other
third party.

9\. _Certain Covenants of Seller and Buyer_.

 

9.1 _No Further Encumbering_. Until the Closing Date or the sooner termination
of this Agreement, Seller shall not further encumber the Property with any
mortgages or deeds of trust, nor terminate or amend the Management Agreement,
the Ground Leases, the Parking Easement Agreement, the Master Declaration or
the Condominium Declaration; provided, however, Buyer acknowledges that, with
respect to the Plettner Lease, landlord and tenant under the lease are
currently engaged in arbitration (the "Plettner Arbitration") to determine the
amount of rent to be paid under the Plettner Lease, and Buyer consents to
any modification or amendment to the Plettner Lease as may be required upon
the settlement of the Plettner Arbitration; provided, further, (i) Seller
shall keep Buyer reasonably informed as to the progress of the Plettner
Arbitration, and (ii) from and after the expiration of the Due Diligence
Period, until Closing or the earlier termination of this Agreement, to the
extent Seller has any approval rights over the terms of any settlement of the
Plettner Arbitration in accordance with the applicable Condominium Documents,
Seller will not exercise such approval rights without first consulting with
Buyer; provided, however, Buyer shall acquire the Property subject to any
modification or amendment to the Plettner Lease as may be required in
connection with such settlement, to the extent that the settlement is outside
of Sellers control, or that Seller approves after consultation with Buyer.

9.2 _WARN ACT_. As set forth above in Section 6.4.9, Buyer acknowledges that
employees of the Property are the employees of Manager and not of Seller, and
that Buyer has no right to cause the termination of such employees. In no
event shall Buyer take any action as to such employees of Manager that would
create or cause any liability to Seller under the WARN Act. Without limitation
on the generality of the foregoing, Buyer covenants to Seller that, from and
after the Closing, a sufficient number of the employees of the Property shall
be offered continued employment at the Property on substantially the same
terms and conditions as their employment prior to the Closing Date and for a
sufficient period of time so that the actions of the parties pursuant to this
Agreement shall not trigger the application of the United States Worker
Adjustment and Retraining Notification Act (the "WARN Act") or any
applicable state law. If Buyer or Manager elects not to

 



-31-   retain or rehire such employees, Buyer shall be responsible for all
obligations, if any, arising with respect to such terminated employees under,
pursuant to, and in accordance with the provisions of the WARN Act and
applicable state law. Buyer acknowledges that it expects Manager to retain or
rehire a sufficient amount of the existing employees, so that Seller will not
be required to give any notices that would otherwise be required under the
WARN Act prior to the termination of employees. Buyer shall indemnify, save,
defend and hold Seller and the Seller Related Parties harmless from and
against any and all liability under the WARN Act and applicable state
law resulting from any termination by Buyer of employees of the Property at
any time after Closing Date. The provisions of this Section 8.2 shall survive
the Closing.

9.3 _Operations_. Subject to the provisions of Section 9.4 below:

_9.3.1_ _Property Maintenance_. From the expiration of the Due Diligence
Period until the Closing Date or the sooner termination of this Agreement,
Seller shall use commercially reasonable efforts consistent with its past
practices to cause the Manager to operate and maintain the Property in the
same manner as prior hereto pursuant to its normal course of business (such
obligation to include the maintenance of casualty and liability insurance
policies in accordance with Sellers normal course of business, but such
obligation to not include extraordinary capital expenditures or expenditures
not incurred in such normal course of business), subject to reasonable wear
and tear and further subject to destruction by casualty or eminent domain or
other events beyond the control of Seller or Manager, including changes in
laws, rules, ordinances and regulations.

 

 _9.3.2_ _Contracts and Agreements_. From the expiration of the Due Diligence
Period until the Closing Date or the sooner termination of this Agreement,
Seller shall not enter into any additional service contracts, equipment leases
or other similar agreements that will be binding upon Buyer without the prior
consent of Buyer; provided, however, without the consent of Buyer, Seller may
enter into service contracts, equipment leases and other agreements which are
cancelable on thirty (30) days notice with no fee. Any additional service
contracts and, equipment lease and other agreements entered into in
accordance with this Section 9.3.2 shall constitute Continuing Agreements and
Equipment Leases being assigned to Buyer on the Closing Date.

 

 _9.3.3_ _Bookings and Reservations_. Seller shall have the right to, without
giving notice to or receiving the consent of Buyer, and shall, make (and
accept cancellations of) bookings for the Hotel in the ordinary course of
business consistent with past practice and otherwise market and promote the
business of the Hotel in generally the same manner as it did prior to the
execution of this Agreement, and all advance bookings shall be booked at
rates, prices and charges charged by Seller for such purposes in the ordinary
course of business consistent with Sellers past practices. Without such
amounts being prorated under this Agreement, Buyer shall honor (and shall
cause Manager to honor, to the extent Buyer has the right to do so under the
Management Agreement) all reservations at the Property, and for any related
conference, banquet, or meeting space or any recreational facilities in
connection with the Property that are made by Seller or Manager on or prior to
the Closing Date and pertain to periods on or after the Closing Date.

 

 _9.3.4_ _Baggage Inventory_. The representatives of Seller and Buyer shall
prepare the inventory as of day immediately preceding the Closing Date (which
inventory shall be binding on all parties thereto) of (a) all luggage, valises
and trunks checked or left in the care

 



-32-   of the Property by guests then or formerly in the Property, (b) parcels,
laundry, valet packages and other property of guests checked or left in the
care of the Property by guests then or formerly in the Property (excluding,
however, property in the safe deposit boxes), (c) all luggage or other
property of guests retained by Buyer, and (d) all items contained in the lost
and found. Buyer shall be responsible from and after the Closing Date for all
baggage, and other items listed in such inventory. The provisions of this
Section 9.3.4 shall survive the Closing.

_9.3.5_ _Licenses and Permits_. Seller will execute and Buyer, where
necessary, will join in the execution of, all applications and instruments
requested by Buyer which are required in connection with the transfer of all
transferable licenses and permits in order to transfer the benefits of such
licenses and permits to Buyer on the Closing Date. Buyer shall be responsible
for, and pay immediately upon Sellers request, all costs related to such
applications and instruments. Seller, subject to the next succeeding sentence,
shall preserve in force all existing licenses and permits and cause all those
expiring during the period between the date hereof and the Closing to be
renewed prior to the Closing Date unless otherwise agreed to by Buyer and
Seller. If any such license or permit shall be suspended or revoked, Seller
shall promptly so notify Buyer and shall use reasonable efforts to cause the
reinstatement of such Authorization without any additional limitation or
condition.

_9.3.6_ _Insurance_. Seller will maintain in effect all policies of casualty,
business interruption and liability insurance which are in effect as of the
date hereof, or similar policies of insurance, with no less than the limits of
coverage now carried with respect to the Hotel. 

_9.3.7_ _Approval Standard_. All approvals by Buyer under this Section 9.3
shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed. Without
limitation on the foregoing, if Seller delivers a written request to Buyer for
Buyers approval of any matter for which Buyers approval is required under
this Section 9.3 (an "Approval Request"), and Buyer fails to deliver to
Seller its written disapproval of such Approval Request within five (5)
business days after its receipt of such Approval Request, then Buyer shall be
deemed to have approved the matter that is the subject of such Approval
Request.

9.4 _Management Agreement_. Notwithstanding anything contained in this
Agreement to the contrary, Buyer acknowledges that Manager has certain rights
under the Management Agreement, including without limitation, the right to
execute certain contracts and other agreements and to take certain actions
with respect to the Property, and the performance of Managers rights and
obligations under the Management Agreement shall not result in a breach by
Seller of its obligations under this Agreement. Any additional service
contracts and equipment leases entered into by Manager on behalf of Seller
prior to the Closing Date in the ordinary course of business, shall constitute
Continuing Agreements and Equipment Leases on the Closing Date. Between the
Effective Date and the Closing Date, the hiring and employment policies with
respect to employees of Manager at the Property shall remain within the sole
control of Manager. Manager shall remain the sole judge of the fitness and
qualifications of such employees and Buyer hereby acknowledges and agrees
that Manager is vested with such discretion in hiring, supervising, directing,
discharging and determining the compensation, other benefits and terms of
employment of such employees, as is set forth in the Management Agreement.

 

9.5 _Seller Claim against BCI_. Seller currently has a claim in the
approximate amount of $42,000 against a company known as BCI. BCI has been
attempting to repay the amounts

 



-33-   due at the rate of approximately $300 per month. Marriott has heretofore
written off the BCI account receivable and the same is not an asset on the
Hotels books and records. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained
in this Agreement, Seller retains all rights to amounts due from BCI and the
same are not being transferred to Buyer. Buyer shall pay, or direct Manager to
pay, all amounts that may be collected by either of them from BCI, net of
reasonable collection and litigation costs. For a period of one (1) year after
the Closing Date, Buyer shall reasonably cooperate, and shall cause Manager to
reasonably cooperate, with Seller in collecting amounts due from BCI. Such
collection efforts shall be at no cost to Buyer or Manager. The terms of this
Section 9.5 shall survive Closing.

 

10\. _DISPOSITION OF DEPOSIT_.

10.1 IF THE TRANSACTION HEREIN PROVIDED SHALL NOT BE CLOSED BY REASON OF
SELLERS DEFAULT UNDER THIS AGREEMENT OR THE FAILURE OF SATISFACTION OF THE
CONDITIONS BENEFITING BUYER UNDER SECTION 5 OR THE TERMINATION OF THIS
AGREEMENT IN ACCORDANCE WITH, SECTION 6, THEN THE DEPOSIT SHALL BE RETURNED TO
BUYER, AND NO PARTY SHALL HAVE ANY FURTHER OBLIGATION OR LIABILITY TO THE
OTHER (EXCEPT UNDER THOSE PROVISIONS OF THIS AGREEMENT THAT EXPRESSLY SURVIVE
A TERMINATION OF THIS AGREEMENT); PROVIDED, HOWEVER, IF THE TRANSACTIONS
HEREUNDER SHALL FAIL TO CLOSE BY REASON OF SELLERS DEFAULT, THEN BUYER SHALL
BE ENTITLED EITHER TO (1) SPECIFICALLY ENFORCE THIS AGREEMENT OR (2)
TERMINATE THIS AGREEMENT (AND IF THIS AGREEMENT IS TERMINATED ON ACCOUNT OF
SELLERS DEFAULT, NEITHER PARTY SHALL HAVE ANY FURTHER RIGHTS OR OBLIGATIONS
TO EACH OTHER HEREUNDER, EXCEPT FOR (a) THE RIGHT OF BUYER TO THE RETURN
OF THE DEPOSIT AND (b) THOSE PROVISIONS OF THIS AGREEMENT WHICH, BY THEIR
EXPRESS TERMS, SURVIVE A TERMINATION OF THIS AGREEMENT). HOWEVER, ANY ACTION
IN SPECIFIC PERFORMANCE MUST BE FILED, IF AT ALL, WITHIN 60 DAYS AFTER THE
CLOSING DATE THEN SCHEDULED UNDER THIS AGREEMENT.

10.2 IN THE EVENT THE TRANSACTION HEREIN PROVIDED SHALL FAIL TO CLOSE BY
REASON OF DEFAULT BY BUYER (INCLUDING A BREACH BY BUYER OF A REPRESENTATION
OR WARRANTY), THEN THE DEPOSIT SHALL BE DELIVERED TO SELLER AS FULL
COMPENSATION AND LIQUIDATED DAMAGES UNDER AND IN CONNECTION WITH THIS
AGREEMENT, AND IN SUCH EVENT, BUYER SHALL NOT BE LIABLE TO SELLER FOR
MONETARY DAMAGES EXCEPT FOR FORFEITURE OF THE DEPOSIT (AND AS PROVIDED UNDER
THOSE PROVISIONS OF THIS AGREEMENT THAT EXPRESSLY SURVIVE A TERMINATION OF
THIS AGREEMENT). IN CONNECTION WITH THE FOREGOING, THE PARTIES RECOGNIZE THAT
SELLER WILL INCUR EXPENSE IN CONNECTION WITH THE TRANSACTION CONTEMPLATED BY
THIS AGREEMENT AND THAT THE PROPERTY WILL BE REMOVED FROM THE MARKET; FURTHER,
THAT IT WOULD BE EXTREMELY DIFFICULT, IF NOT IMPOSSIBLE AND IMPRACTICABLE TO
ASCERTAIN WITH ANY ACCURACY THE EXTENT OF DETRIMENT TO SELLER CAUSED BY THE
BREACH BY BUYER UNDER THIS AGREEMENT AND THE FAILURE OF THE CONSUMMATION OF
THE TRANSACTION CONTEMPLATED BY THIS AGREEMENT OR THE AMOUNT OF COMPENSATION
SELLER SHOULD RECEIVE AS A RESULT OF BUYERS BREACH OR DEFAULT, AND THAT THE
LIQUIDATED

 



-34-   DAMAGE AMOUNT SET FORTH IN THIS SECTION REPRESENTS BOTH PARTIES EFFORTS TO
APPROXIMATE SUCH POTENTIAL DAMAGES. IN THE EVENT THE SALE CONTEMPLATED HEREBY
SHALL NOT BE CONSUMMATED ON ACCOUNT OF BUYERS DEFAULT, THEN THE RETENTION OF
THE DEPOSIT SHALL BE SELLERS SOLE AND EXCLUSIVE REMEDY UNDER THIS AGREEMENT
BY REASON OF SUCH DEFAULT AND THE PARTIES SHALL TAKE SUCH ACTION AS MAY BE
REQUIRED TO CAUSE THE DEPOSIT TO BE DELIVERED TO SELLER. SELLER AGREES THAT
IN THE EVENT IT IS ENTITLED TO THE DEPOSIT, THE FORFEIT OF THE DEPOSIT AS
LIQUIDATED DAMAGES MEANS THAT BUYERS AGGREGATE LIABILITY IN CONNECTION WITH
BUYERS BREACH IS THE AMOUNT OF THE DEPOSIT AND NOT A GREATER SUM.

   |  | BUYER INITIALS |  |  |  | SELLER INITIALS |  | 
 

10.3 IN THE EVENT THE TRANSACTION HEREIN PROVIDED SHALL CLOSE, THE DEPOSIT
SHALL BE APPLIED AS A PARTIAL PAYMENT OF THE PURCHASE PRICE.

11\. _Tax Reduction Proceedings_. Seller may file and/or prosecute
an application for the reduction of the assessed valuation of any of the
Property or any portion thereof for real estate taxes or a refund of real
estate taxes previously paid relating, in whole or in part, to periods before
the Closing Date. The amount of any tax refunds (net of attorneys fees and
other costs of obtaining such tax refunds) with respect to any Property for
the tax year in which the Closing Date occurs shall be apportioned between
Seller and Buyer. Tax refunds for any year prior to the tax year in which the
Closing Date occurs shall belong entirely to Seller. If, in lieu of a tax
refund for the tax year in which the Closing Date occurs or a prior tax year,
a tax credit is received for the tax year in which the Closing Date occurs or
subsequent tax year, then (x) within thirty (30) days after receipt by Seller
or Buyer, as the case may be, of evidence of the actual amount of such tax
credit (net of attorneys fees and other costs of obtaining such tax credit),
the tax credit apportionment shall be readjusted between Seller and Buyer and
(y) upon realization by Buyer of a tax savings on account of such credit,
Buyer shall pay to Seller an amount equal to the savings realized (as
apportioned). All refunds, credits or other benefits applicable to any fiscal
period prior to the fiscal year in which the Closing Date occurs shall belong
solely to Seller (and Buyer shall have no interest therein). The provisions
of this Section 11 shall survive the Closing.

12\. _Miscellaneous_.

 

12.1 _Brokers_.

_12.1.1_ Buyer represents and warrants to Seller that no broker or finder has
been engaged by it in connection with any of the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement or to its knowledge is in any way connected with any of such
transactions. Except as provided in Section 12.1.2 below, Seller represents
and warrants to Buyer that no broker or finder has been engaged by it in
connection with any of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or to
its knowledge is in any way connected with any of such transactions. In the
event of a claim for brokers or finders fee or commissions in connection
herewith, then Seller shall indemnify, protect, defend and hold
Buyer harmless from and against the same if it shall be

 



-35-   based upon any statement or agreement alleged to have been made by Seller,
and Buyer shall indemnify, protect, defend and hold Seller harmless from and
against the same if it shall be based upon any statement or agreement alleged
to have been made by Buyer. The obligations of the parties under this Section
12.1 shall survive the Closing or any termination of this Agreement.

 

 _12.1.2_ Hodges Ward Elliott Inc., a Georgia corporation, ("Sellers Broker")
has been engaged by Seller in connection with the transaction contemplated by
this Agreement, and without limitation on the foregoing provisions of this
subsection, if and only if the transaction contemplated hereby shall close in
accordance with the terms of this Agreement, Seller shall pay Sellers Broker
a commission pursuant to a separate agreement between Seller and Sellers
Broker.

12.2 _Further Instruments_. Each party will, whenever and as often as it shall
be requested so to do by the other, cause to be executed, acknowledged or
delivered any and all such further instruments and documents as may be
necessary or proper, in the reasonable opinion of the requesting party, in
order to carry out the intent and purpose of this Agreement.

12.3 _Confidentiality_. The terms of the transfers contemplated in this
Agreement, including the Purchase Price and all other financial terms, as well
as the information discovered by Buyer and its agents in connection with the
Property shall remain confidential and shall not be disclosed by Buyer without
the written consent of Seller except (1) to Buyers officers, employees,
members, potential lenders, agents and representatives (including legal
counsel, accountants and similar professionals to the extent Buyer deems it
reasonably necessary to inform such party, in which case Buyer shall inform
each of the foregoing parties of such partys obligations under this Section
and shall secure the agreement of such parties to be bound by the terms
hereof); or (2) as otherwise required by law or regulation. Buyer shall
indemnify, defend and hold Seller harmless from and against any claims arising
from a breach by it of this Section. The restrictions in this Section shall
survive a termination of this Agreement.

12.4 _Cumulative Remedies_. No remedy conferred upon a party in this
Agreement is intended to be exclusive of any other remedy herein or by law
provided or permitted, but each shall be cumulative and shall be in addition
to every other remedy given hereunder or now or hereafter existing at law, in
equity or by statute (except as otherwise expressly herein provided).

12.5 _No Waiver_. No waiver by a party of any breach of this Agreement or of
any warranty or representation hereunder by the other party shall be deemed to
be a waiver of any other breach by such other party (whether preceding or
succeeding and whether or not of the same or similar nature), and no
acceptance of payment or performance by a party after any breach by the other
party shall be deemed to be a waiver of any breach of this Agreement or of any
representation or warranty hereunder by such other party, whether or not the
first party knows of such breach at the time it accepts such payment or
performance. No failure or delay by a party to exercise any right it may have
by reason of the default of the other party shall operate as a waiver of
default or modification of this Agreement or shall prevent the exercise of any
right by the first party while the other party continues to be so in default.

12.6 _Consents and Approvals_. Except as otherwise expressly provided herein,
any approval or consent provided to be given by a party hereunder must be in
writing to be effective and may be given or withheld in the absolute
discretion of such party.

 



-36-  12.7 _Press Releases_. Any press release issued with respect to the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement shall be subject to the prior
approval of Buyer and Seller, which approval shall not be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned or delayed, except if a party is required to make a
public announcement under applicable law, in which case no such approval by
the other party shall be required but such party shall consult with the other
party regarding the form and substance of such public announcement.

 

12.8 _Modification_. This Agreement may not be modified or amended except by
written agreement signed by all parties.

 

12.9 _Survival_. Unless otherwise expressly provided for in this Agreement,
the representations, warranties, covenants and conditions of the parties set
forth in this Agreement shall not survive the consummation of the transaction
contemplated by this Agreement and the delivery and recordation of the Deed.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, (a) all indemnification obligations in this
Agreement shall survive the Closing; and (b) the indemnification obligations
set forth in Sections 12.1, 12.3 and 12.12 shall survive the termination of
this Agreement.

 

12.10 _Intentionally Deleted_.

12.11 _Post Closing Access_. For a period of three (3) years subsequent to the
Closing Date, Seller and its employees, agents and representatives shall be
entitled to access during business hours to all documents, books and records
given by Seller to Buyer for tax and audit purposes, regulatory compliance,
and cooperation with governmental investigations upon reasonable prior notice
to Buyer, and shall have the right to make copies of such documents, books
and records at Sellers expense.

12.12 _Indemnification Obligations_. The indemnification obligations under
this Agreement shall be subject to the following provisions:

_12.12.1_ The party seeking indemnification ("Indemnitee") shall notify the
other party ("Indemnitor") of any claim against Indemnitee within forty-five
(45) days after it has notice of such claim, but failure to notify
Indemnitor shall in no case prejudice the rights of Indemnitee under this
Agreement unless Indemnitor shall be prejudiced by such failure and then only
to the extent of such prejudice. Should Indemnitor fail to discharge or
undertake to defend Indemnitee against such liability (with counsel
reasonably approved by Indemnitee), within thirty (30) days after Indemnitee
gives Indemnitor written notice of the same, then Indemnitee may settle such
claim, and Indemnitors liability to Indemnitee shall be conclusively
established by such settlement, the amount of such liability to include both
the settlement consideration and the reasonable costs and expenses, including
attorneys fees, incurred by Indemnitee in effecting such settlement.
Indemnitee shall have the right to employ its own counsel in any such case,
but the fees and expenses of such counsel shall be at the expense of
Indemnitee unless: (a) the employment of such counsel shall have been
authorized in writing by Indemnitor in connection with the defense of such
action, (b) Indemnitor shall not have employed counsel to direct the defense
of such action, or (c) Indemnitee shall have reasonably concluded that there
may be defenses available to it which are different from or additional to
those available to Indemnitor (in which case Indemnitor shall not have the
right to direct the defense of such action or of Indemnitee), in any of which
events such fees and expenses shall be borne by Indemnitor.

 



-37-  _12.12.2_ The indemnification obligations under this Agreement shall cover
the costs and expenses of Indemnitee, including reasonable attorneys fees,
related to any actions, suits or judgments incident to any of the matters
covered by such indemnities.

 

 _12.12.3_ The indemnification obligations under this Agreement shall also
extend to cover any claim against any present or future advisor, trustee,
director, officer, partner, member, manager, employee, beneficiary,
shareholder, fiduciary, participant or agent of or in Indemnitee or any entity
now or hereafter having a direct or indirect ownership interest
in Indemnitee.

day other than a Saturday, Sunday or federal holiday or state holiday for the
State of Illinois

_12.13.4_ _Severability_. If any term or provision of this Agreement or the
application thereof to any person or circumstance shall, to any extent, be
invalid or unenforceable, the remainder of this Agreement, or the application
of such term or provision to persons or circumstances other than those as to

each such term and provision of this Agreement shall be valid and be enforced
to the fullest extent permitted by law.

 

 _12.13.5_ _Interpretation_. Words used in the singular shall include the
plural, and vice-versa, and any gender shall be deemed to include the other.
Whenever the words "including", "include" or "includes" are used in this
Agreement, they shall be interpreted in a non-exclusive manner. The captions
and headings of the Sections of this Agreement are for convenience of
reference only, and shall not be deemed to define or limit the provisions
hereof. Except as otherwise indicated, all Exhibit and Section references in
this Agreement shall be deemed to refer to the Exhibits and Sections in this
Agreement. Each party acknowledges and agrees that this Agreement (a) has been
reviewed by it and its counsel, (b) is the product of negotiations between the
parties, and (c) shall not be deemed prepared or drafted by any one party. In
the event of any dispute between the parties concerning this Agreement, the
parties agree that any ambiguity in the language of the Agreement is to not to
be resolved against Seller or Buyer, but shall be given a
reasonable interpretation in accordance with the plain meaning of the terms
of this Agreement and the intent of the parties as manifested hereby.

 



-38-  12.14 _Governing Law; Venue_. This Agreement shall be construed and enforced
in accordance with the internal laws of the State of Illinois (without regard
to conflicts of law). The parties hereto agree to submit to personal
jurisdiction in the State of Illinois in any action or proceeding arising out
of this Agreement and, in furtherance of such agreement, the parties hereby
agree and consent that without limiting other methods of obtaining
jurisdiction, personal jurisdiction over the parties in any such action or
proceeding may be obtained within or without the jurisdiction of any court
located in Illinois and that any process or notice of motion or other
application to any such court in connection with any such action or proceeding
may be served upon the parties by registered or certified mail to or
by personal service at the last known address of the parties, whether such
address be within or without the jurisdiction of any such court. Any legal
suit, action or other proceeding by one party to this Agreement against the
other arising out of or relating to this Agreement shall be instituted only
the Circuit Court of Cook County, Illinois or the United States District Court
for the Northern District of Illinois, and each party hereby waives any
objections which it may now or hereafter have based on venue and/or _forum
non-conveniens_ of any such suit, action or proceeding and submits to the
jurisdiction of such courts. Seller and Buyer hereby irrevocably and
unconditionally waive any and all right to trial by jury in any action, suit
or counterclaim arising in connection with, out of or otherwise relating to
this Agreement. The provisions of this Section 12.14 shall survive the Closing
or the termination hereof.

 

12.15 _Third Party Beneficiaries_. Except as otherwise expressly provided in
this Agreement, Seller and Buyer do not intend by any provision of this
Agreement to confer any right, remedy or benefit upon any third party, and no
third party shall be entitled to enforce or otherwise shall acquire any right,
remedy or benefit by reason of any provision of this Agreement. 

12.16 _No Recordation_. In no event shall this Agreement or any document or
memorandum related to the subject matter of this Agreement be recorded in the
public records without the prior written consent of Seller.

12.17 _Effectiveness of Agreement_. In no event shall any draft of this
Agreement create any obligations or liabilities, it being intended that only a
fully executed and delivered copy of this Agreement will bind the parties
hereto.

 

12.18 _No Joint Venture_. This Agreement does not and shall not be construed
to create a partnership, joint venture or any other relationship between the
parties hereto except the relationship of seller and buyer specifically
established hereby.

12.19  _Successors and Assigns_. Buyer may not assign or transfer its rights
or obligations under this Agreement (or make an offer or enter into
negotiations to do so) without the prior written consent of Seller (in which
event such transferee shall assume in writing all of the transferors
obligations hereunder, but such transferor shall not be released from its
obligations hereunder), such consent to be within Sellers sole and absolute
discretion; provided, however, Buyer may assign its interest in this
Agreement without the consent of Seller to a "single-purpose bankruptcy remote
entity" which is "controlled by Buyer" (in which event such transferee shall
assume in writing all of the transferors obligations hereunder, but Buyer
shall not be released from its obligations hereunder). As used herein,
"controlled by Buyer" with respect to an entity means that Buyer: (1) has the
sole ability to direct the management, policies and operation of such entity,
directly or indirectly, through voting securities or otherwise; and (2) Buyer
owns more than fifty percent (50%) of the direct or indirect ownership
interests in such entity. Any change in control or majority ownership of
Buyer constitutes an assignment for purposes of this subsection. No consent
given by Seller to any transfer

 



-39-   or assignment of Buyers rights or obligations hereunder shall be construed
as a consent to any other transfer or assignment of Buyers rights or
obligations hereunder. In addition, Buyer shall not re-sell the Property or
assign its rights or obligations under this Agreement (or make an offer or
enter into negotiations to do so) through a "double escrow" or other similar
mechanism without Sellers prior written consent (which consent may be
withheld in Sellers sole and absolute discretion). No transfer or assignment
in violation of the provisions hereof shall be valid or enforceable. Subject
to the foregoing, this Agreement and the terms and provisions hereof shall
inure to the benefit of and shall be binding upon the successors and assigns
of the parties.

12.20  _Notices_. Unless otherwise agreed to by the parties, all notices
required or permitted to be given hereunder shall be in writing. Such notices
shall be effective upon receipt or refusal of receipt following deposit into
the United States mail, registered or certified, return receipt requested,
postage prepaid, or if hand delivered or if sent by nationally recognized
overnight courier providing evidence of delivery or when sent by telecopy or
similar facsimile transmission (with a copy by mail delivered on the next
business day), addressed as follows:

any notice that a party desires to give or is required to give hereunder.

12.21 _Legal Costs_. The parties hereto agree that they shall pay directly any
and all legal costs which they have incurred on their own behalf in the
preparation of this Agreement, all other agreements pertaining to this
transaction and that such legal costs shall not be part of the closing costs.
In addition, if any party hereto brings any suit or other proceeding with
respect to the subject matter or the enforcement of this Agreement, the
prevailing party (as determined by the court, agency or other authority before
which such suit or proceeding is commenced), in addition to such other relief
as may be awarded, shall be entitled to recover reasonable attorneys fees,
expenses and costs of investigation actually incurred from the non-prevailing
party, subject to the limitations on the liability of Seller set forth
in Section 12.22 below. The foregoing includes attorneys fees, expenses and
costs of investigation (including those incurred in appellate proceedings),
costs incurred in establishing the right to indemnification, or in any action
or participation in, or in connection with, any case or proceeding under
Chapter 7, 11 or 13 of the Bankruptcy Code (11 United States Code Sections 101
_et seq_.), or any successor statutes. This Section shall survive any
termination of this Agreement.

12.22 _Limitation of Liability_. No present or future partner, member,
director, officer, shareholder, employee, advisor, affiliate or agent of or
in Seller or Buyer or any affiliate of Seller or Buyer shall have any personal
liability, directly or indirectly, under or in connection with this Agreement
or any agreement made or entered into under or in connection with the
provisions of this Agreement, or any amendment or amendments to any of the
foregoing made at any time or times, heretofore or hereafter, and Seller or
Buyer, as the case may be, and its respective successors and assigns
and, without limitation, all other persons and entities, shall look solely to
Sellers or Buyers assets, respectively, for the payment of any claim or for
any performance, and Buyer and Seller each hereby waive any and all such
personal liability. For purposes of this Section 12.22, no negative capital
account or any contribution or payment obligation of any partner or member in
Seller or Buyer, as the case may be, shall constitute an asset of Seller or
Buyer, as applicable. The limitations of liability contained in this Section
are in addition to, and not in limitation of, any limitation on liability
applicable to Seller provided elsewhere in this Agreement or by law or by any
other contract, agreement or instrument. Anything to the contrary in this
Section 12.22 notwithstanding, as additional inducement to Seller to enter
into this Agreement, Chesapeake Lodging, L.P., a Delaware limited partnership,
shall, pursuant to the Joinder attached to this Agreement, in the event this
Agreement is terminated, unconditionally guarantee the payment and performance
of any obligations of Buyer under this Agreement, which obligations survive
the termination of this Agreement.

 



-41-  12.23 _Bulk Sales_. Buyer and Seller agree to cooperate and take any actions
reasonably necessary to comply with the bulk sales statutes, if any, of the
State in which the Hotel Unit and Improvements are located, in connection with
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Buyer shall be solely
responsible for the payment of any bulk sales, hotel sales taxes, or hotel
use taxes and for compliance with any and all laws related to such taxes,
including any withholding laws, whether due before or after Closing or in
connection with the transaction contemplated in this Agreement, if any, and
Buyer shall indemnify, protect, defend and hold Seller harmless from and
against any claim in any way arising from such matters whether accruing or
arising before or after Closing. In consideration of Buyers agreements and
indemnification contained in this Section 12.23, at Closing, Buyer and Seller
shall agree upon a reasonable allocation of personal property in connection
with the Buyers filing of any forms to comply with such bulk sales statutes
and Seller shall provide Buyer with a credit in the amount of One Hundred
Thousand Dollars ($100,000.00) to help defray Buyers obligations under this
Section 12.23. Other than the credit provided in the preceding sentence,
Seller shall have no further obligation with respect to the matters set forth
in this Section 12.23 and Buyer indemnifies Seller with respect thereto, which
indemnity shall survive the Closing Date.

 

12.24 _Independent Audit_. Buyer, at Buyers option, may (i) have the audit
(the "Existing Audit"), performed by KPMG, LLP ("KPMG"), with respect to
Sellers books and records which relate exclusively to the Property, for the
years 2009 and 2010 (a) revised so that the financial statements reflect the
historical cost basis of the Property, (b) updated with unaudited comparative
interim financial statements as required by Section 3.05 of Regulation S-X,
and (c) recertified by KPMG such that the Existing Audit runs to the benefit
of Buyer (and Seller shall reasonably cooperate to cause the Existing Audit
to be so revised, updated and recertified), or (ii) at Buyers sole cost and
expense, engage a third-party certified public accountant to perform an audit
("Buyers Audit") of Sellers books and records which relate exclusively to
the Property, including the historical financial statements of the Property,
which audit shall include all disclosures required by generally accepted
accounting principles and the Securities and Exchange Commission regulations,
specifically in accordance with Section 3.05 of Regulation S-X and all related
rules and regulations thereof; provided, however, that (i) neither the
revision, update and recertification of the Existing Audit, nor the
completion of Buyers Audit, shall be a condition precedent to Buyers
obligation to close the transactions described in this Agreement, and (ii)
Buyer shall promptly reimburse Seller for any reasonable out-of-pocket
expenses incurred by Seller or any of its affiliates in connection with the
revision, update and recertification of the Existing Audit, or the performance
of Buyers Audit. Seller shall reasonably cooperate in connection with the
revision, update and recertification of the Existing Audit or Buyers Audit
and shall provide all information reasonably requested by the accountants
performing such audit with respect to the Property, at no cost or expense to
Seller. In connection with the revision, update and recertification of the
Exiting Audit or Buyers Audit, Seller shall provide the accountants
performing such audit with representation letters reasonably acceptable to
Seller and such accountants, at no cost or expense to the Seller. The
covenant of Seller with respect to the revision, update and recertification of
the Existing Audit or Buyers Audit as set forth in this Section 12.24 shall
survive Closing for a period of ninety (90) days.

12.25 _Time of Essence_. Time is of the essence of each and every term,
provision and covenant of this Agreement.

12.26 _Waiver of Trial by Jury_. THE PARTIES HEREBY IRREVOCABLY WAIVE THEIR
RESPECTIVE RIGHTS TO A JURY TRIAL OF ANY CLAIM OR CAUSE OF ACTION BASED UPON
OR ARISING OUT OF THIS AGREEMENT. THIS WAIVER SHALL APPLY TO

 



-42-   ANY SUBSEQUENT AMENDMENTS, RENEWALS, SUPPLEMENTS OR MODIFICATIONS TO THIS
AGREEMENT. IN THE EVENT OF LITIGATION, THIS AGREEMENT MAY BE FILED AS A
WRITTEN CONSENT TO A TRIAL BY THE COURT. 

12.27 _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed in one or more
counterparts, each of which shall be deemed an original, but all of which
shall constitute one and the same document. Delivery by facsimile, or e-mail
of a PDF copy, of a counterpart of this Agreement executed by a party shall
constitute delivery by such party of such partys executed counterpart of
this Agreement.

12.28 _Required Disclosures_. Buyer acknowledges the following required
disclosures: 

_12.28.1_ _Disclosure required by C.R.S. Section 38 35.7 101_. SPECIAL TAXING
DISTRICTS MAY BE SUBJECT TO GENERAL OBLIGATION INDEBTEDNESS THAT IS PAID BY
REVENUES PRODUCED FROM ANNUAL TAX LEVIES ON THE TAXABLE PROPERTY WITHIN SUCH
DISTRICTS. PROPERTY OWNERS IN SUCH DISTRICTS MAY BE PLACED AT RISK FOR
INCREASED MILL LEVIES AND EXCESSIVE TAX BURDENS TO SUPPORT THE SERVICING OF
SUCH DEBT WHERE CIRCUMSTANCES ARISE RESULTING IN THE INABILITY OF SUCH A
DISTRICT TO DISCHARGE SUCH INDEBTEDNESS WITHOUT SUCH AN INCREASE IN MILL
LEVIES. BUYER SHOULD INVESTIGATE THE DEBT FINANCING REQUIREMENTS OF THE
AUTHORIZED GENERAL OBLIGATION INDEBTEDNESS OF SUCH DISTRICTS, EXISTING MILL
LEVIES OF SUCH DISTRICT SERVICING SUCH INDEBTEDNESS, AND THE POTENTIAL FOR AN
INCREASE IN SUCH MILL LEVIES.

 

 _12.28.2_ _Disclosure required by C.R.S. Section 38 35.7 102_. THE PROPERTY
IS LOCATED WITHIN A COMMON INTEREST COMMUNITY AND IS SUBJECT TO THE
DECLARATION FOR SUCH COMMUNITY. THE OWNER OF THE PROPERTY WILL BE REQUIRED TO
BE A MEMBER OF THE OWNERS ASSOCIATION FOR THE COMMUNITY AND WILL BE SUBJECT
TO THE BYLAWS AND RULES AND REGULATIONS OF THE ASSOCIATION. THE DECLARATION,
BYLAWS, AND RULES AND REGULATIONS WILL IMPOSE FINANCIAL OBLIGATIONS UPON THE
OWNER OF THE PROPERTY, INCLUDING AN OBLIGATION TO PAY ASSESSMENTS OF THE
ASSOCIATION. IF THE OWNER DOES NOT PAY THESE ASSESSMENTS, THE ASSOCIATION
COULD PLACE A LIEN ON THE PROPERTY AND POSSIBLY SELL IT TO PAY THE DEBT. THE
DECLARATION, BYLAWS, AND RULES AND REGULATIONS OF THE COMMUNITY MAY PROHIBIT
THE OWNER FROM MAKING CHANGES TO THE PROPERTY WITHOUT AN ARCHITECTURAL REVIEW
BY THE ASSOCIATION (OR A COMMITTEE OF THE ASSOCIATION) AND THE APPROVAL OF
THE ASSOCIATION. PURCHASERS OF PROPERTY WITHIN THE COMMON INTEREST COMMUNITY
SHOULD INVESTIGATE THE FINANCIAL OBLIGATIONS OF MEMBERS OF THE ASSOCIATION.
PURCHASERS SHOULD CAREFULLY READ THE DECLARATION FOR THE COMMUNITY AND THE
BYLAWS AND RULES AND REGULATIONS OF THE ASSOCIATION.
